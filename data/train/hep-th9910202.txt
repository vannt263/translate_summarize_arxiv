    "supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking communicated by supergravity ( sugra ) is a very natural and attractive solution to the hierarchy problem . in its usual incarnation ,",
    "this mechanism requires only a hidden sector that breaks susy , and the presence in the effective theory below the planck scale of the following higher - dimension operators connecting the hidden and visible sector fields : _",
    "eff ~ & d^4 ^ + & + d^2 . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the 4-dimensional planck scale , @xmath3 is a field in the hidden sector with @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a matter field in the visible sector , @xmath6 are higgs fields , and @xmath7 is a field strength for the standard model gauge group .",
    "this simple setup generates all required soft susy breaking terms of order @xmath8 ( including the @xmath9 term @xcite ) .",
    "the main drawback of this scenario is that it does not explain why the squark masses generated from the term @xmath10 approximately conserve flavor , as required to avoid excessive flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "proposed an elegant solution to this problem in the context of higher - dimensional theories .",
    "it was pointed out that if the visible and hidden sectors are localized on spatially separated ` 3-branes ' , then contact terms of the form can be suppressed even though they are not forbidden by any symmetry of the low - energy theory .",
    "this can be easily understood by focusing on the effective @xmath11-dimensional theory ( @xmath12 ) below the string scale @xmath13 , but above the compactification scale @xmath14 .",
    "if the hidden and visible branes are separated by a distance of order @xmath15 , then the contribution from the exchange of bulk fields of mass @xmath16 is suppressed by the yukawa factor @xmath17 .",
    "we also expect the contributions of extended objects with string - scale tensions to be exponentially suppressed by @xmath17 .",
    "we see that stringy physics generates only exponentially small contact terms in the @xmath11-dimensional effective theory .",
    "when we match the @xmath11-dimensional theory to the 4-dimensional low - energy effective theory , a more careful analysis is required to show that the exchange of supergravity kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations does not lead to contact terms of order @xmath18 .",
    "we perform this analysis for a specific model in this paper , with the result that no such terms are generated .",
    "thus , all of the effective interactions of the form of are highly suppressed , and susy breaking must be communicated in a different way .    further argued that , given this suppression of the terms in , the leading contribution to susy breaking in the visible sector arises at loop level , and is directly related to the conformal anomaly .",
    "this mechanism applied to gaugino masses and @xmath19 terms was independently discovered in , which also gave a detailed discussion of the exactness of the result . in this ` anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ' ( amsb ) scenario , all soft susy breaking parameters are completely predicted up to an overall scale by anomalous dimensions and conserve flavor to a high degree .",
    "this leads to interesting testable predictions for the gaugino masses @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the slepton mass - squared terms are predicted to be negative if the visible sector is the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "there are have been several suggestions in the literature for natural solutions to this problem @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the basic features of the amsb scenario in detail in a specific 5-dimensional effective field theory .",
    "the theory consists of minimal 5-dimensional sugra compactified on a @xmath20 orbifold .",
    "the two @xmath21-dimensional boundaries of this space corresponding to the orbifold fixed - points serve as the ` 3-branes ' on which the hidden and visible sectors are localized .",
    "the higher susy of the 5-dimensional theory is broken explicitly down to @xmath22 in 4 dimensions by the orbifold projection .",
    "this setup is very similar to the five - dimensional effective theory arising from heterotic m - theory after calabi - yau compactification of six of the eleven dimensions @xcite , but our field content is the minimal one required for consistency of the five - dimensional effective theory . in particular , the calabi - yau moduli do not appear as light fields in our five - dimensional model .",
    "this accounts for the substantial differences between amsb and other analyses of supersymmetry breaking in the heterotic m - theory scenario .",
    "we defer consideration of non - minimal field content for later work .",
    "our final result is that anomaly mediation is the leading source of susy breaking in the visible sector if the radius is sufficiently large , but it is crucial to take into account the dynamics of the radius of the compactified dimension .",
    "while our analysis is limited to a specific 5-dimensional theory with a particular mechanism for stabilizing the radius , we believe that these features are more general .    starting with the 5-dimensional theory described above",
    ", we construct the 4-dimensional effective theory below the compactification scale to analyze susy breaking .",
    "as already mentioned , a crucial feature of the effective theory is the presence of a radius modulus corresponding to the size of the compactified dimension . in particular ,",
    "if this modulus is not stabilized we will show that its equations of motion set to zero the supersymmetry breaking order parameter for amsb , namely the four - dimensional sugra auxiliary scalar .",
    "this agrees with a direct five dimensional sugra analysis , where there are no bulk fields which can transmit the effect of such an order parameter to the visible sector .",
    "this naturally raises doubts as to whether amsb occurs in this scenario @xcite .",
    "a related issue is the fact that the radius modulus must be stabilized in order to cancel the cosmological constant in the presence of susy breaking .",
    "we show that if the bare bulk cosmological constant is zero , there is no potential for the radius modulus , but the low - energy cosmological constant can not be cancelled . in the presence of a bulk",
    "cosmological constant , susy breaking gives this modulus a runaway potential .",
    "the picture changes completely when a stablization mechanism is introduced for the radius .",
    "we propose a stabilization mechanism for the radius modulus that relies entirely on gaugino condensation and susy breaking .",
    "the mechanism requires two super - yang  mills ( sym ) sectors , one in the bulk and one localized on a 3-brane , as well as a susy breaking sector localized on the hidden 3-brane . upon matching to the 4-dimensional theory ,",
    "the bulk sym sector gives rise to a 4-dimensional sym sector with a gauge coupling that depends on the radius @xmath15 .",
    "this gives rise to an @xmath15-dependent gaugino condensate which , together with the brane - localized gaugino condensate , gives a stabilizing potential for the radius modulus .",
    "the radius is naturally large compared @xmath23 if the condensation scale of the 3-brane super - yang  mills sector @xmath24 is small compared to @xmath23 .",
    "the radius depends only logarithmically on @xmath24 , we can obtain a sufficiently large radius for anomaly mediation to dominate if the theory is strongly coupled near the scale @xmath23 . since the condensation scale of the 3-brane super - yang ",
    "mills sector is naturally exponentially small compared to the fundamental scale , this mechanism does not require the introduction of small parameters at the fundamental scale .",
    "susy breaking ( and fine - tuning ) is required to cancel the net low - energy cosmological constant .",
    "the mass of the radius modulus is large compared to @xmath1 , and the effective theory below this scale is of the ` sequestered ' form proposed in .",
    "the general lesson we draw from this is that amsb works provided that moduli are stabilized .",
    "our stabilization is similar in spirit to the racetrack mechanism @xcite , but it does not require large gauge groups and our results follow from a completely systematic effective field theory analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the 5-dimensional model and carry out the matching to the 4-dimensional effective theory .",
    "we show that there are no @xmath25 contact terms between the hidden and visible sectors , and that the cosmological constant can not be cancelled in the absence of a mechanism for radius stabilization . in section 3 , we show how gaugino condensation can fix the radius , and show that anomaly mediation works in this scenario .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider minimal ( ungauged ) 5-dimensional sugra compactified on a @xmath20 orbifold with matter and gauge fields localized on the two orbifold boundaries .",
    "this system is relatively simple to study because the orbifold projection explicitly breaks the supersymmetry of the 5-dimensional theory ( 8 real supercharges ) down to @xmath22 in 4 dimensions ( 4 real supercharges ) .",
    "the on - shell lagrangian for the bosonic fields of 5-dimensional sugra is @xcite _ sugra,5 = -m_5 ^ 3 & , where @xmath26 are 5-dimensional spacetime indices , and @xmath27 is the field strength for the graviphoton @xmath28 . under the @xmath29 parity ,",
    "the fields transform as @xmath30 , where the parity assignments of the bosonic fields are given in table  1 .",
    "the orbifold projection keeps only those field configurations that are even under @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that there are fields localized on the orbifold boundaries , so these must be coupled to sugra .",
    "the lagrangian has the form _ 5 = _",
    "sugra,5 + ( x^5 ) _ vis + ( x^5 - r ) _ hid .",
    "we will not need the details of the bulk - boundary couplings in @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but it is important for us to know that such couplings exist and preserve @xmath22susy . as shown in for 5-dimensional gauge- and hypermultiplets , the couplings of bulk and boundary fields can be worked out in a straightforward fashion if the auxiliary fields of the bulk theory are known . building on earlier work @xcite , an explicit off - shell formulation for 5-dimensional sugra was recently given by zucker @xcite .",
    "following , one first decomposes the 5-dimensional sugra multiplet into off - shell multiplets of the unbroken 4-dimensional @xmath22susy .",
    "in addition to the @xmath22sugra multiplet , this yields two vector multiplets ( with vector fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) with odd orbifold parity , and one chiral multiplet ( with real scalar fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) with even parity .",
    "it should then be possible to couple these multiplets to @xmath22fields localized on the boundaries using the usual @xmath22superfield calculus .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the bulk sym multiplet consists of a vector field @xmath37 , a real scalar @xmath38 , and a symplectic majorana gaugino @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "these fields are taken to transform under the orbifold projection as shown in table 2 .",
    "the even fields form an @xmath22sym multiplet @xmath41 , while the odd fields form an @xmath22chiral multiplet @xmath42 .",
    "these fields can be coupled to the boundary fields using the usual rules for constructing @xmath22invariants .",
    "( for more details , see . )",
    "we assume that the fields on the boundaries are uncharged under the bulk sym sector .",
    "however , there are in general higher - dimension operators coupling the bulk sym fields to the boundary fields . using a normalization of the fields where the gauge coupling is factored out of the kinetic terms _ 5 =",
    ", the bulk sym propagator is proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , exchange of sym fields between the boundaries can give rise to contact terms of order @xmath44 only if there are boundary couplings of order @xmath45 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that no such terms are possible unless there is a singlet @xmath46 on the boundary , in which case we can write _ 5 = ( y ) d^2 s ( ^ _ ) + , where @xmath47 is the field strength of the @xmath22sym field @xmath41 .",
    "( note that boundary couplings involving the @xmath22chiral multiplet @xmath42 are restricted by gauge invariance @xmath48 , @xmath49 . )",
    "if there are singlets in both the hidden and visible sector , this will induce contact terms between them only at the 1-loop level , and the presence of two sym propagators in the leading diagram means that the effects are suppressed by @xmath50 , and therefore negligible .",
    "( the contact terms are terms by @xmath51 invariance . )",
    "we conclude that introducing the bulk sym sector does not introduce new contact terms into the effective 4-dimensional theory .",
    "we now construct the 4-dimensional effective theory for the bulk sym sector . when we perform the kk decomposition , the odd fields have kk masses starting at @xmath14 , and are therefore integrated out .",
    "the even fields have a massless zero mode , which becomes a 4-dimensional sym sector in the effective theory .",
    "the tree - level matching condition for the effective 4-dimensional gauge coupling is = .",
    "because @xmath52 depends on @xmath15 , gaugino condensation in the effective 4-dimensional sym sector will give rise to a @xmath53-dependent dynamical superpotential .",
    "the @xmath53 dependence of the dynamical superpotential can be determined exactly using holomorphy arguments @xcite .",
    "the holomorphic 4-dimensional gauge coupling @xmath54 is given exactly by s(= 1/g_5 ^ 2 ) = + c , where @xmath55 is a real constant that parameterizes the scheme dependence .",
    "it may appear that cancelling large logs requires us to match at a scale @xmath56 : s(= 1/t ) + c. however , for @xmath57 this leads to ( for an @xmath58 gauge group ) s ( ) + ( t ) + c. the logarithmic dependence on @xmath53 implies that @xmath59 depends on @xmath60 .",
    "but from the 5-dimensional theory we know that @xmath61 is derivatively coupled , so this is impossible .",
    "it is easy to see that the only way to avoid this contradiction consistent with holomorphy is .",
    "we have also checked that carefully evaluating the threshold corrections due to the infinite tower of sym kk states also reproduces .",
    "the dynamical scale of the theory is therefore _",
    "bulk e^-32 ^ 2 t / ( 9 n g_5 ^ 2 ) .    in order to obtain believable numerical estimates",
    "we need to estimate the constant of proportionality in .",
    "this can be done using ` dimensional analysis ' ( nda ) @xcite .",
    "the principle of nda is that in a strongly - coupled theory with no small parameters , both the fundamental and the effective theory become strongly coupled ( in the sense that loop corrections are order 1 ) at the same scale . to estimate @xmath62 , note that nda implies that if the gauge coupling and the radius are chosen so that the fundamental theory is strongly - coupled at a scale @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .",
    "the strong - coupling value of the 5-dimensional gauge coupling is .",
    "g_5 ^ 2    5-dimensional loop counting parameter , and we have taken into account the @xmath65 dependence appropriate for the large @xmath65 limit .",
    "the strong - coupling value of the radius is where the kk modes have mass of order @xmath63 : .",
    "r |_strong = .",
    "t |_strong ~. this implies that the strong - coupling value of the exponential in is order 1 , and we obtain _ bulk ~ e^-32 ^ 2 t / ( 9 n g_5 ^ 2 ) . the dynamical superpotential generated in the 4-dimensional effective theory is therefore w_bulk , dyn ~ _",
    "bulk^3 ~ e^-32 ^3 t / ( 3 n g_5 ^ 2 ) . using @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the dimensionless prefactor is @xmath68 .",
    "however , this estimate depends sensitively on the value used for @xmath69 , and should be regarded as very uncertain .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that the prefactor will be large unless nda is completely misleading .",
    "theories spectacularly confirm the expectations of nda @xcite . ]      in addition to the bulk sym sector , we assume that the theory contains a sym sector localized on one of the boundaries . as with the bulk sym , we assume that there are no matter fields charged under the sym gauge group . if this sym sector is in the hidden sector , there is no danger from flavor - violating higher - dimension contact terms .",
    "if it is in the visible sector , the lowest - dimension potentially flavor - violating operator is is _ 5 ~(y ) d^4 q^q ( w^w _ ) + , where @xmath70 is the field strength of the boundary sym multiplet .",
    "this gives flavor - violating interactions suppressed by @xmath71 , where @xmath24 is the dynamical scale .",
    "this is negligible for the values of @xmath24 we will be interested in ( see below ) , and we conclude that the boundary sym sector may be either in the hidden or the visible sector .",
    "now we are ready to analyze the 4-dimensional effective theory , including all sectors .",
    "below the scale @xmath14 , the 4-dimensional theory consists of 4-dimensional sugra and the modulus @xmath53 coupled to the bulk and boundary sym sectors .",
    "in addition , the theory contains the visible and hidden sectors , which we do not specify explicitly .",
    "we now write the effective lagrangian below the scales @xmath72 and @xmath24 where the sym sectors become strong , and below the scale of susy breaking in the hidden sector . in this regime ,",
    "the only light fields are the sugra fields , the modulus @xmath53 , the goldstino from the susy breaking sector , and the visible sector fields .",
    "the effective lagrangian is _",
    "eff = & -m_5 ^ 3 d^4 ^ ( t + t^ ) + & + ( d^2 ^3 + ) - v_hid + . here",
    "c ~ _ bdy^3 arises from gaugino condensation in the boundary sym theory ( we neglect @xmath65 dependence in the boundary sym theory ) ; a ~ , b = arise from gaugino condensation in the bulk sym theory ; and @xmath73 is the vacuum energy generated by the susy breaking sector .",
    "we have chosen not to add a 5-dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "the constant @xmath55 can be chosen real by a @xmath51 rotation , but @xmath74 is in general complex .",
    "the terms omitted in contain the interactions of the visible sector fields and a goldstino from susy breaking in the hidden sector ( which will eventually become the longitudinal components of the massive gravitino ) .",
    "the terms involving the goldstino can be included using a non - linear realization of susy coupled to sugra @xcite , but are not relevant for computing the effective potential for @xmath53 ; the same is true for the visible sector interactions .",
    "the superpotential in is exact , but the potential contains unknown @xmath75 corrections from loop corrections and higher - dimension operators .",
    "these will be shown to give small corrections below .",
    "we now turn to the minimization of the scalar potential , neglecting corrections to the potential . the scalar potential obtained from is v = \\ { ( 3 c^ * b a e^-b t + ) + b |a|^2 e^-b ( t + t^ ) } + v_hid .",
    "note that the first term is proportional to the boundary sym gaugino condensate .",
    "only the first term in depends on @xmath76 .",
    "minimizing with respect to @xmath76 , we obtain the effective potential for @xmath77 : v = \\ { -6 b |a| |c| e^-b t_1 + 2 b ( b t_1 + 3 ) |a|^2 e^-2 b t_1 } + v_hid . the term in brackets is a sum of two different exponentials with opposite signs , the negative sign in the first term arising from the minimization with respect to @xmath76 . as @xmath78 the first term dominates , and the potential approaches @xmath79 from below .",
    "provided the second term dominates for small @xmath80 there will be a nontrivial minimum with vacuum energy _ below _",
    "this means that the parameters can be adjusted to give a vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "we look for a minimum with @xmath81 . explicitly carrying out the minimization we find that b e^-b ~ , where we have neglected terms suppressed by powers of @xmath82 .",
    "note that @xmath83 can be made arbitrarily large by making @xmath24 small compared to @xmath84 .",
    "( the loop suppression factors also tend to increase @xmath83 . )",
    "the vacuum energy at the minimum is - + v_hid , where @xmath85 .",
    "the fact that the first term is negative allows us to choose the parameters to fine - tune the cosmological constant to zero .",
    "because the superpotential has non - trivial @xmath53 dependence , the @xmath86 equation of motion no longer sets @xmath87 .",
    "instead we have .",
    "susy is broken , and the gravitino mass is m_3/2 ~ ~ , so that @xmath88 .",
    "the mass of the radius modulus is computed from , where the primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath80 .",
    "the kinetic term for @xmath80 arises from mixing with the metric ; it can be made manifest by making a @xmath80-dependent weyl transformation .",
    "this gives a kinetic term @xmath89 , and the physical mass of the radius modulus is m_r^2 ~ ^2 .",
    "it is easy to see that the other real scalar and the fermion component of @xmath53 also get a mass of this order . comparing with",
    ", we see that ~b 1 .",
    "since the modulus is heavy we can integrate it out of our effective theory .",
    "the different component fields in @xmath53 have mass differences of order @xmath90 , so this is not an approximately supersymmetric threshold ; also it is easy to see that @xmath86 does not vanish ( @xmath91 ) . however , @xmath53 couples to visible sector only through higher - dimension derivative interactions ( recall that the modulus is the zero - mode of the five - dimensional graviton polarized transverse to the branes ) , so this does not give a contribution to susy breaking in the visible sector at order @xmath18 .",
    "we conclude that at order @xmath18 , the effective theory below the modulus mass is precisely the ` sequestered form ' proposed in : the visible sector is coupled only to a geometrically flat four - dimensional sugra background with broken susy ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "we now return to the question of the corrections to the potential in .",
    "the potential contains unknown @xmath75 corrections from loop corrections and higher - dimension operators , and one might worry that these are more important than the exponentially ( in @xmath53 ) suppressed effects in the superpotential .",
    "this does not occur because the potential vanishes in the limit where the superpotential vanishes , so the corrections enter multiplicatively .",
    "this ensures the stability of the results above , in that the corrections to the modulus potential are of order @xmath93 smaller than the leading potential we computed .",
    "we now show that this scenario for radius stabilization can give rise to a sufficiently large radius without introducing small numbers or fine tuning . from",
    ", the stabilized value of the radius is r ~ ( ) . because the radius depends logarithmically on the fundamental parameters , we can not obtain hierarchies of many orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact , because of the factor @xmath94 multiplying the logarithm in , the bulk sym gauge coupling @xmath95 must be large , and the fundamental theory must be close to strongly coupling .",
    "the simplest assumption is that both gravity and the bulk sym sector become strong at a single scale @xmath63 .",
    "nda gives @xmath96 , and we will take this scale to be the fundamental scale of the theory ( the scale of string / m - theory excited states ) . using the nda estimates for @xmath63 and @xmath97",
    ", we obtain r ~ ( ) . using @xmath98 and @xmath99 ,",
    "we obtain ( for @xmath100 ) r ~ , _ 0 ~2 10 ^ 18 .",
    "this is sufficient to suppress fcnc effects from massive string states , but bulk gravitational loops give contact terms suppressed by @xcite ~ ~ ~4 10 ^ -5 .",
    "this gives a contribution to soft scalar mass - squared terms of order @xmath101 , which is comparable to the contribution from anomaly mediation !",
    "it is interesting that this mechanism for radius stabilization can naturally stabilize the radius at a value where loop effects are important .",
    "this may give a solution to the problem of negative slepton masses , but we will not pursue this point here .",
    "another possibility is that the bulk sym sector becomes strong at a scale @xmath102 that is smaller than the scale @xmath103 . here",
    ", @xmath102 is a fundamental scale of new strong physics , while @xmath103 is not directly a physical scale , but corresponds to a weak gravitational coupling at the fundamental scale @xmath102 .",
    "this occurs naturally if the gauge interactions propagate in fewer dimensions than gravity in the fundamental theory . for @xmath104",
    ", we obtain @xmath105 .",
    "this is sufficient to suppress gravitational loop effects , and also suppresses flavor - changing contributions from string / m - theory states at the scale @xmath102 .",
    "we have also checked that the contact terms from bulk gauge fields are negligible .",
    "these estimates are quite rough , but we conclude that it is very plausible that this mechanism can give a sufficiently large radius so that anomaly mediation dominates .",
    "we have studied a five - dimensional model with brane - localized visible and hidden sectors localized on ` 3-branes ' and shown that when the compactification radius is properly stabilized , the transmission of supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector proceeds by the mechanism of anomaly - mediation .",
    "although the radius modulus participates strongly in the supersymmetry breaking , it does not contribute to soft visible sector masses at order @xmath18 because it does not directly couple to the visible brane .",
    "the stabilization mechanism for the radius modulus employed in this paper is very simple , involving gaugino condensates in the bulk and on a brane .",
    "the bulk gauge fields do not give additional contributions to visible soft masses due to the constraints of gauge invariance .",
    "the advantage of this mechanism is that it gives a non - perturbative superpotential for the modulus arising from field - theoretic mechanisms that are under theoretical control .",
    "it is also possible that that such a superpotential could also arise from non - perturbative string / m - theory effects due to extended states .",
    "this work is evidence that anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking gives a model - independent contribution to soft supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector at order @xmath18 in _ any _ model with susy breaking on a hidden - sector brane , and stabilized moduli . if there are no additional light bulk fields that give a larger contribution , anomaly - mediation dominates , giving a natural solution to the supersymmetric flavor problem as well as potentially testable predictions .",
    "these features can be upset by the presence of additional bulk fields with significant couplings to the visible sector .",
    "knowledge of the true string theory vacuum , or experiment , is required to find out if such light non - minimal bulk fields are present .",

    "<S> the stabilization mechanism requires only parameters of order one at the fundamental scale , with no fine - tuning except for the cosmological constant . </S>"
