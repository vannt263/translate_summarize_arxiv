    "the recent discovery of superconductivity at @xmath440 k in 2  @xcite has opened new prospects for the understanding of the microscopic origin of high-@xmath2 superconductivity .",
    "in contrast to the complex crystal structures , multicomponent nature and complications due to magnetism and strong electron - electron correlations of the high-@xmath2 cuprates , 2  has a simple hexagonal crystal structure ( alb@xmath5-type ) comprising close - packed mg@xmath6 layers alternating with graphite - like boron layers and @xmath7 electrons involved in the superconducting process .",
    "several attempts  @xcite have been made to introduce dopants in the mg layers in order to explore the relationship between @xmath2 , crystal structure and doping level .",
    "the reported experiments invariably lead to a decrease in @xmath2 .",
    "successful substitution at the b sites can be also achieved by carbon doping  @xcite , which results in a significant contraction of the @xmath8 lattice parameter , but affects little the interlayer separation .",
    "@xmath2 also decreases with increasing doping .",
    "experimental studies of the superconducting properties of 2 show deviations from those calculated with the standard bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "various experiments , including scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )  @xcite , point - contact spectroscopy  @xcite , specific heat measurements  @xcite , optical  @xcite and raman spectroscopy  @xcite suggested the existence of a secondary superconducting gap , implying that the simple one - band approach for 2  superconductivity must be extended .",
    "on the basis of the electronic structure , the existence of multiple gaps has been invoked in order to explain the magnitude of @xmath2 in 2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , solution of the full eliashberg equations at low temperature yields different gap values for the different parts of the fermi surface ( @xmath9 mev for 3d sheets and @xmath10 mev for 2d sheets )  @xcite .",
    "although there is much support for the applicability of the multiband description to 2 , there is still some debate in the literature , in particular since some tunneling and nmr measurements show only a single gap  @xcite .",
    "measurements have also made significant contributions to the understanding of the superconducting properties of 2 , mainly through the precise determination of the penetration depth , @xmath11 from the zero - temperature extrapolated value of the @xmath12 spin depolarisation rate , @xmath13 .",
    "early experiments  @xcite proposed that the low temperature magnetic penetration depth of 2  shows a quadratic temperature dependence and were interpreted in terms of unconventional superconductivity with an energy gap that has nodes at certain points in the @xmath14 space . however , a systematic study by niedermayer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that the temperature evolution of the depolarisation rate , @xmath1 in polycrystalline 2 could be well interpreted in terms of a two - gap model .    in the present paper",
    "we employ the transverse - field ( tf ) variant of the  technique to characterise the superconducting properties of carbon - doped 2   systems ( , @xmath0= 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.06 ) .",
    "analysis of the experimental data in terms of a two - gap model reveals the effect of electron doping on the superconducting gaps and the anisotropic properties of the compounds .",
    "polycrystalline  ( @xmath0= 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.06 ) samples were prepared by reaction of mg , amorphous b and carbon black at 900@xmath15c for 2 h , as described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the  measurements were performed with the gps spectrometer on the @xmath16m3 muon beamline at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) , switzerland . pressed sample pellets were attached with low - temperature varnish on a ag sample - holder placed on the stick of a he continuous flow cryostat operating down to 1.8 k. after cooling the sample in an external field , @xmath17 to temperatures below @xmath2 in order to induce a homogenous flux line lattice , positive muons ( 100% spin - polarised ) with their initial spin polarisation transverse to the external field were implanted in the solid sample .",
    "the implanted muons come to rest at an interstitial site and act as highly sensitive local magnetic probes . in the presence of local fields , @xmath18 , the @xmath12 spin undergoes larmor precession with frequency , @xmath19 , where @xmath20=13.553 khz / g is the muon gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath12 spin polarisation , @xmath21 is measured by monitoring the positrons preferentially emitted along the @xmath12 spin direction at the instant of muon decay . for type ii superconductors , @xmath21 is an oscillatory function with decreasing amplitude and the damping of the @xmath12 precession signal provides a measure of the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field , @xmath22 in the vortex state and hence of the magnetic penetration depth , @xmath11 .",
    "for polycrystalline samples in the vortex state , the tf @xmath12 spin polarisation function is approximately gaussian ( @xmath23 ) and the depolarisation rate , @xmath1 is proportional to the second moment of the field distribution ( @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 ) . in the case of anisotropic ( @xmath28 4 )",
    "type ii superconductors , @xmath1 is related to the in - plane magnetic penetration depth , @xmath29 via the relation  @xcite : @xmath30=7.086\\times10 ^ 4~\\lambda_{ab}^{-2}[nm^{-2}]$ ] .",
    "the anisotropy of the upper critical field in single crystalline 2  was reported as 6 ( at 5 k ) @xcite or 4.3 @xcite , while for polycrystalline samples and thin films , the reported values span a wide range .",
    "the above equation holds in the london limit ( @xmath31 ) and in the absence of pinning - induced distortions of the vortex lattice .",
    "the former restriction is valid for 2  ( @xmath32 7 nm  @xcite , @xmath33 95 nm @xcite ) , while the latter is addressed below .",
    "the london model predicts that the second moment of the magnetic field distribution of a perfect vortex lattice should be independent of @xmath17 for @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the distance between vortices . in order to check the influence of pinning on the depolarisation rate , @xmath1 ,",
    "we have measured its field dependence at 5 k. our results show that @xmath36 increases almost linearly up to 50 mt , displays a peak at @xmath480 mt and then decreases rapidly , reaching a plateau at higher fields ( @xmath37 t ) in excellent agreement with the reported data for 2  @xcite .",
    "we thus performed our measurements at an external field of 0.6 t in order to ensure formation of an ideal vortex lattice and avoid underestimation of @xmath38 .",
    "[ f.1 ] presents the extracted temperature dependence of the tf-  depolarisation rate at @xmath17= 0.6 t for the  ( @xmath0= 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.06 ) samples .",
    "the values of @xmath39 are derived after subtraction of the normal state temperature - independent depolarisation rate , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) . in the case of mgb@xmath42c@xmath43",
    ", @xmath39 increases monotonically as the temperature decreases below @xmath435 k and reaches a plateau at @xmath44 6 k , remaining almost constant at lower temperatures .",
    "analogous behaviour is observed for the other two compositions , except that as the doping level increases , the low - temperature plateau smooths out and the extrapolated value , @xmath45 shifts to lower values .",
    "the experimental @xmath46 dependence is reproduced well by means of a two - gap model , while attempts to fit the experimental data with a @xmath47-law or an isotropic one - gap model led to unsatisfactory results ( inset in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ) .",
    "the two - gap model is based on the existence of two discrete superconducting gaps , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , at @xmath3= 0 k , both closing at @xmath2 and each associated with a different energy band . by assuming that the coupling between the two bands ( i.e. due to impurity or phonon scattering ) is sufficiently weak ( @xmath50 )",
    ", @xmath46 can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52d\\varepsilon\\ ] ] @xmath53 is the fermi distribution of quasiparticles and @xmath54 the energy of the normal electrons relative to the fermi energy : @xmath55 each band is characterised by a partial sommerfeld constant , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the total sommerfeld constant ) . as the sommerfeld constant is proportional to the density - of - states at the fermi level , the ratios @xmath56/@xmath58 determine the partial @xmath59(@xmath60 ) for the two bands .",
    "the temperature dependence of the band gaps is taken from bcs theory , i.e. @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the normalised bcs gap at the reduced temperature , @xmath63  @xcite .",

    "the evolution of the depolarisation rate @xmath45 with @xmath2 and of the superconducting gap sizes , @xmath48(0 ) and @xmath49(0 ) with carbon content , @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath45 decreases monotonically with increasing carbon content and decreasing @xmath2 ( d@xmath45/d@xmath2= @xmath640.25 @xmath65s@xmath66k@xmath66 ) .",
    "the @xmath411% decrease in @xmath45 at @xmath0= 0.06 reflects an increase of @xmath46% in the in - plane magnetic penetration depth , @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , as the carbon content increases , the two gap sizes at 0 k shift to smaller values at nearly the same rate ( d@xmath68/d@xmath0= @xmath6420.4 mev , @xmath69= 1,2 ) .",

    "the calculated values of @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the effective mass enhancement in the b layers in units of @xmath78 ) for  ( table i ) are larger than those obtained for high-@xmath2 superconductors and decrease quasilinearly with increasing doping .",
    "in addition , @xmath76 can be converted first into a 2d carrier density , @xmath90 on the b planes by multiplying by the interlayer distance , @xmath91 and then into an effective fermi temperature , @xmath92 through the expression , @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath92 decreases from @xmath43200 k in 2to @xmath42700 k in 6  resulting in @xmath94 0.01 .",
    "uemura  @xcite has established that in contrast to the conventional bcs superconductors in which @xmath950.01 , the cuprates , fullerides and other exotic superconductors have rather high @xmath2 with respect to @xmath92 with @xmath94 0.01 - 0.1 .",
    "it is noticeable that the 2  superconductors also share this feature and are located in the uemura plot between conventional @xmath96-wave and unconventional high-@xmath2 materials .",
    "the electronic band structure of 2 has been extensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "the valence band of 2  is made up predominantly of b 2@xmath97 states , which form two distinct sets of bands of @xmath98 and @xmath99 type whose @xmath14 dependence differs considerably .",
    "the most pronounced dispersion for the b @xmath100 states is along the @xmath101-k direction of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , while a flat zone is formed in the @xmath102 direction ( @xmath101-a ) , reflecting the 2d character of the boron lattice .",
    "these @xmath1 bands are partially unoccupied creating a hole - type conduction band which gives rise to two 2d light - hole and heavy - hole sheets forming coaxial cylinders along the @xmath101-a bz direction .",
    "the strong coupling of these holes to the optical bond stretching modes drives the superconductivity in 2  @xcite .",
    "in addition , b @xmath16 states dominate at the bottom of the conduction band , while the fermi surface associated with these bands consists of a 3d tubular network .",
    "these bands exhibit maximum dispersion along the @xmath101-a direction of the bz .",
    "theoretical calculations estimate that 44% of @xmath71(@xmath60 ) comes from the 2d @xmath1 cylindrical sheets and the rest from the 3d @xmath16 sheets  @xcite . for the superconducting state of 2 ,",
    "the gap is nonzero everywhere on the fermi surface and the gap values are grouped in two distinct regions  @xcite .",
    "the larger superconducting gap , @xmath48 on the 2d @xmath1 cylindrical sheets has an average value of @xmath46.8 mev , while the smaller one , @xmath49 associated with the 3d @xmath16-sheets an average value of @xmath41.8 mev .",
    "although the electronic structure and the superconducting behaviour of 2  has been studied theoretically in detail , there is no systematic investigation concerning the effect of doping . in the framework of the rigid band model",
    ", it is expected  @xcite that doping of the b sublattice with c should lead to a shift of the fermi level to higher energies in the region of the dos minimum ( pseudogap ) .",
    "a rigid band model estimate gives a value of @xmath40.16 electrons / cell in order to fill the @xmath1 bands  @xcite .",
    "electrons are also added to the @xmath16 bands that lie in the same energy range , leading to a total doping level @xmath40.25 electrons / cell .",
    "thus it is expected that electron doping should lead to both superconducting gaps decreasing gradually .",
    "however , the differences in the slope @xmath64dln@xmath2/d@xmath103 between high - pressure experiments ( @xmath40.28 @xmath104 ) on 2  @xcite and chemical substitution  @xcite ( @xmath40.37 @xmath104 ) , imply that the effect of carbon doping is more complicated due to the b layer contraction and theoretical studies beyond the rigid band approximation are necessary .",
    "carbon substitution should also lead to an increase in the interband impurity scattering , which should result in the size of the @xmath1- and @xmath16-gaps converging to the same value .",
    "however , theoretical calculations  @xcite have shown that the particular electronic structure of 2  results in extremely weak @xmath105 impurity scattering , even for low quality samples and in the presence of mg vacancies , mg - substitutional impurities and b - site substitutions by n or c. the dominant mechanism for impurity scattering is due to intraband scattering of the @xmath1 and @xmath16 bands with the scattering rate inside the @xmath16 bands greater than that of the @xmath1 bands .",
    "intraband scattering does not change @xmath2 and the gap values but influences the penetration depth ( anderson s theorem )  @xcite .",
    "our experimental data can be described well with a two - gap model in which impurity scattering is essentially ignored .",
    "this indicates that interband impurity scattering is relatively weak and both superconducting gaps are preserved , at least up to @xmath0= 0.06 .",
    "carbon doping also reduces both superconducting gaps with this effect relatively more pronounced for the smaller gap , @xmath49 associated with the 3d sheets .",
    "the error in @xmath70/@xmath106 ( @xmath4@xmath107(@xmath72)/@xmath108(@xmath72 ) ) is quite large and hence it is difficult to extract reliably its dependence on doping .",
    "nonetheless , there is a tendency for @xmath70/@xmath106 to increase with increasing doping level . in any case , systematic theoretical studies are necessary to shed more light on this issue .",
    "in conclusion , analysis of the temperature dependence of the tf-  depolarisation rate for  ( @xmath0= 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.06 ) shows that increasing electron doping is accompanied by a decrease of the low - temperature @xmath1(0 ) and the spectral weight , @xmath109 , consistent with the decreasing density - of - states at the fermi level . within a two - gap model ,",
    "both superconducting gap sizes decrease almost linearly with the smaller gap affected more on doping , while the interband scattering remains relatively weak up to at least @xmath0= 0.06 .",
