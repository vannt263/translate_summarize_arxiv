    "although the standard model of particle physics has been established as the uncontested theory of all interactions down to distances of @xmath0 m , there are good reasons to believe that there is a new physics arising soon at the experimental level @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", string theory provides an excelent background to solve long standing problems of theoretical high energy physics .",
    "it is by now a widespread idea that m - theory @xcite can be a reasonable description of our universe . in the field theory limit ,",
    "it is described by a solution of the ( eventually 11-dimensional ) einstein equations with a cosmological constant by means of a four dimensional membrane . in this picture",
    "only gravity survives in the extra dimensions , while the remaining matter and gauge interactions are typically four dimensional .",
    "this avenue presents us a possibility of tackling with two different problems at the same time , namely a means of testing the up to now far from experimental and observational data string theory , and a theoretical framework to cosmology , whose theoretical background needs a full understanding of quantum gravity in order to correctly deal with the puzzling question of the initial singularity .",
    "general relativity always evaded quantization .",
    "einstein gravity is a nonrenormalizable theory at a low loop level @xcite , and atempts to include supersymmetry in order to cancel divergencies only postponed the problem to a higher loop @xcite .",
    "string theory showed a way from its very basis of how to succesfully quantize gravity . at the same time , and especially after the discovery of the anomaly cancellation mechanism @xcite , now even sometimes quoted as the first superstring revolution , strings are taken as quasi unique in their description .",
    "moreover , with the discovery of the duality symmetry such a uniqueness has been further enhanced @xcite , leading to the concept of a universal theory , the so called m - theory largely unknown , describing an eleven dimensional misterious , master theory , mother of all string descriptions on their side related by duality and containing in their field theory limit a version of 11-dimensional supergravity @xcite .",
    "the key question however lies on what can turn a higher dimensional theory into something realistic , describing our four dimensional world .",
    "some hints are known since almost a century and have been used before in the context of supergravity .",
    "it is the kaluza klein approach @xcite , where extra dimensions are compactified being curled up in such a size that they can not be observed in the daily life , that in spite of being appealing , has encountered several problems being still an active field of inquire .",
    "still there are proposals where some of these dimensions are large enough to be probed by microphysics @xcite .",
    "recently , horava and witten @xcite considered m - theory in a rather intriguing situation .",
    "it has been argued that our universe can be seen as a solution of a higher dimensional theory .",
    "strings can be open or closed .",
    "the closed string sector contains gravity and further components .",
    "the open string sector contains matter fields isolated into their extremities . in this proposed picture",
    "the open string extremities containing the matter fields are restrained to live in the physical universe , which in horava and witten s proposal is described by a membrane .",
    "later on , randall and sundrum @xcite described the universe as a solution of higher dimensional field equations with boundary conditions describing the membrane .",
    "as a result , they obtained a space with full fledged extra dimensions but with a warp such that the effective penetration of gravitons into the extra dimensions is small , and the effective gravitational interaction is observationally four dimensional . in this picture there is a possibility that gravitational fields , while propagating out of the brane , speed up reaching farther distances in smaller time as compared to light propagating inside the brane , a scenario that for a resident of the brane implies shortcuts @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is our aim in this work to further develop these ideas in the case of a frw brane universe @xcite .",
    "the subject was developed until now from the point of view of the brane @xcite , where all time dependence is embedded in the bulk metric written in gaussian coordinates .",
    "the price paid is the complicated form of the bulk metric and , consequently , the complicated behaviour of geodesics in the bulk . however ,",
    "if we treat the problem from the point of view of the bulk , where the brane evolves in a non - trivial way in a static ads background , we can construct explicitly the causal structure of null geodesics leaving and subsequently returning to the brane . as it turns out ,",
    "shortcuts are common , although harmless at the present days ( the delay is vanishingly small ) , but could be large in the era before nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , one of the main goals of string theory nowadays is to prove itself able of coping with experimental evidences .",
    "branes have been shown to be useful tools to understand the physics of strings and m - theory @xcite .",
    "as it has also recently been pointed out @xcite , brane universes , such as the one described above , could imply the existence of relics of the extra dimensions in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "unfortunately , recent developments with inflation guided by a scalar field on the brane indicate that the consistency equation is preserved @xcite . in this work",
    "however , we show that if inflation took part on the brane , the causal structure is definitely changed by those gravitational shortcuts , possibly leading to a non - usual period of causal evolution of scales",
    ". this could be responsible for distinct predictions in the cosmic microwave background structure for inflationary models .",
    "this scenario has been proposed as an actually realizable possibility @xcite@xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that in some scenarios shortcuts are very difficult to be detected today because of the extremely short delay of the photon as compared to the graviton coming from the same source .",
    "the planck mass is the natural scale where string effects become important .",
    "however , it is not possible to achieve such an energy level in particle physics accelerators .",
    "nonetheless , as we mentioned above , cosmology may provide an alternative laboratory for string theory . from the eighties several authors tried to analysed the kind of cosmology arising from string inspired models , which are essentially general relativity in higher dimensions together with scalar and tensor fields . in case",
    "we also introduce the brane concept , a consistent picture of the brane universe is achieved , and we can describe the evolution of the universe by means of solutions of the einstein field equations in higher dimensions with a four dimensional membrane",
    ".    extensive use of specific properties of strings , such as the t - duality , may provide simple explanations of several properties of the universe , though of course an observational check is missing .",
    "nonetheless , a pre big - bang scenario can be described providing a very sophisticated physical picture of the universe .",
    "several solutions also indicating inflation have been obtained in what is now usually called brane cosmology .",
    "it is thus essential to provide means of comparing those results to some observational data , which is the largest difficulty in string theory .",
    "the best proposal is to use the extremely sophisticated data of the cosmic microwave background , first obtained from the pioneering cobe satelite and more recently by the detailed analysis of the wmap .",
    "such observations are opening the avenue for precision cosmology , and results with error bars less a percent are now available . in such a case",
    "one can compare the predictions of inflationary models with observations , and even quantitatively distinguish between different inflationary scenarios with a chance of favouring or discarding string inspired models of cosmology or brane cosmology .",
    "the definition of a scalar potential directly from string theory has been an important issue . in @xcite",
    "an attempt was made in order to derive the scalar interaction from a brane - brane interaction .",
    "this kind of approach reviewed in @xcite has been very recently taken over in @xcite .",
    "a few different and new forms for the inflaton potential have been derived , showing that at least one can hope to derive inflationary models directly from the properties which caracterize string theory and its consequences , namely m - theory and branes .",
    "the formulation of proper junction conditions at surfaces of discontinuity is a fundamental problem in gravitational theory .",
    "well - known examples are the schwarzschild and oppenheimer - snyder problems , which require the junction of the interior field of a static or collapsing star to the exterior vacuum field .    in newtonian theory the problem is directly solved by imposing the standard continuity and jump conditions connecting the potential and its first derivatives across the surface . in general relativity , however , the gravitational potential is not only determined by the smoothness of physical conditions but also by the smoothness of the coordinates we are using to describe spacetime .",
    "a pioneering work on these subjects was made in 1922 by c. lanczos @xcite , on which w. israel @xcite based his landmark formalism forty years later .",
    "independent of these works , g. darmois @xcite derived junction conditions for the special case of a boundary surface , i.e. a surface through which both the metric and the extrinsic curvature tensor are continuous .",
    "all these ideas are now known as the darmois - israel junction / thin - shell formalism , which has found wide application in general relativity and cosmology , including further studies of gravitational collapse , the evolution of bubbles and domain walls in a cosmological setting , wormholes and more recently in brane cosmology .    in this section",
    "we review the junction formalism as it was first derived by israel .",
    "we also derive the darmois - israel conditions from the gravitational action in the context of @xmath1-dimensional theories and give an alternative approach using distribution theory .",
    "consider a spacetime @xmath2 ( pseudo - riemannian manifold with signature @xmath3 ) with metric @xmath4 in the coordinate system @xmath5 .",

    "properties of a non - intrinsic character enter when we consider the way in which @xmath9 `` bends '' in @xmath2 .",

    "the israel formalism will require the normals in @xmath2 to point from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "we should stress that the majority of the existing literature deals with spherical symmetry where the direction of the normal is clear , but in more complicated cases great care must be taken .",

    "we argue , however , that those high redshifts could be available . indeed ,",
    "if inflation takes place on the brane , high redshifts could be present in the beginning of the inflationary epoch .    denoting the redshift",
    "when inflation ends by @xmath387 , if the size of the present universe , @xmath388 , is expected to be in causal contact during inflation , we must reach at least a redshift in the beginning of inflation , @xmath389 , that solves @xmath390    the unusual results in brane - world cosmology are expected if inflation ends before the transition time , when the quadratic term in friedmann equation dominates . in this case",
    "we get [ result ] = z(0 ) = 2h_0l z_e^4 .",
    "if @xmath391 , it is simple to note , from equation ( [ timetime ] ) , that the evolution of the brane in the bulk is not altered during inflation .",
    "thus , we can substitute the result([result ] ) in the complete expression for the causal gravitational horizon ( [ completehorizon ] ) , ( ) _ z_r h_0l z_e^2 .    this equation tells us that in the time of nucleosyntesis , when @xmath392 , @xmath393 for a model with inflation ending just before what would be the planck era with @xmath394 ( where @xmath395 ) .",
    "this proves that successfully inflationary models ending before the transition time necessarily make relevant changes in the causal structure of the universe .",
    "we are able to sketch the gravitational horizon for this kind of configuration . in fig .",
    "[ inflation ] we show the behaviour of the hubble horizon in comoving coordinates @xmath396 and the graviton horizon @xmath397 for an inflationary model ending just before the planck era , @xmath398 and producing the necessary number of e - folds to solve the horizon problem .",
    "the fraction of the universe in causal contact by gravitational signs in the nucleosynthesis epoch is just the present horizon @xmath399 . today",
    ", the gravitational horizon would be @xmath400 .",
    "we have shown that gravitational shortcuts in three braneworld models are common and there are many consequences .    in the brane wall model , where the universe is replaced by a domain wall , we have proved that shortcuts may exist and above all abundant , which is a necessary condition in order to solve the homogeneity problem .",
    "the model shows interesting results as the delay of the time of flight inside the brane that can be comparable with the time of flight of the graviton itself .",
    "this lends further support for a thermalization via graviton exchange through the extra dimensions .    in the brane",
    "static models , the ads - schwarzschild and ads - reissner - nordstrm bulks also open up the possibility of having shortcuts provided both the spatial section has positive curvature and a set of strong restrictions on the brane intrinsic tension must be satisfied .",
    "moreover , its location in the bulk has to be respected .",
    "it is interesting to notice that despite the fact that the charge contributes to have a negative @xmath402 and thus facilitates the existence of shortcuts , there are more restrictive conditions for the energy coming from @xmath299 and from the horizons equation which do not appear in the uncharged case . in this way",
    ", the results favor the existence of shortcuts in bulks with shielded singularities with the same conditions for @xmath264 and @xmath292 as the ads - schwarzschild case and also impose what is basically a fine - tunning in the energy that already exists in the uncharged model directly from the junction conditions .    finally ,",
    "studying the shortcut problem in the cosmological braneworld model from the point of view of the bulk , we have explicitly shown that shortcuts are indeed common in late time universes , though they are extremelly small and the time advance of the graviton can be safely neglected .",
    "however , we have also learned that gravitational signs may leave and subsequently return to the brane even in early universes .",
    "we have shown that those shortcuts exist and that the new scale of the model , @xmath403 , implies in a minimum time scale for the reception of those signs by an observer on the brane . before that critical time",
    "the brane itself evolves like a null - geodesic in the bulk .",
    "if high initial redshifts were available the shortcuts just found could solve the horizon problem without inflation .",
    "more important however , may be the effect of those shortcuts in an inflationary epoch on the brane .",
    "braneworld models incorporate two changes in the cosmology , namely , the modified friedmann equation and the possibility of leaking of gravity in the extra dimension . using the first of those modifications it was shown that , remarkably , the consistency equation is mantained in the brane - world formalism when the inflation is guided by a scalar field minimally coupled on the brane @xcite .",
    "this consists in bad news for those who expect that brane cosmological configurations could probe the extra dimensionality of our universe .",
    "however , we have shown that with an inflationary epoch in the brane evolution the causal structure of the universe could be strongly modified .",
    "this could be a sign of an unusual evolution of the perturbations from the time they cross the de sitter horizon , @xmath404 , during inflation , through the time they became causally connected again . in this case",
    ", there could be distinct predictions for the microwave background radiation structure even with the same consistency equation during inflation .",
    "thus , further investigation on the dynamics of perturbations in inflationary brane - world models may prove useful to probe the dimensionality of space - time .",
