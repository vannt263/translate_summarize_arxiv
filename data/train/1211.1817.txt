    "these structure functions are calculated with target mass correction ( tmc ) @xcite and cteq6.6 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at the leading - order ( lo )  @xcite .",

    "however , for the completeness we are showing here the results for the charged and neutral current induced ( anti)neutrino - iron differential cross section in figs.[d2sigma_cc_nu_nubar ] and [ d2sigma_nc_nu_nubar ] respectively . in the case of neutral current we have performed numerical calculations at lo .",
    "we observe that medium effects are important in the study of differential scattering cross sections .",
    "for example , when the calculations are performed for charged current neutrino induced process at lo , medium effects like pauli blocking , fermi motion and nucleon correlations which are taken into account for our base calculations , results in the reduction of the differential cross section which changes by @xmath251 at low y and increases to @xmath252 at high values of y for the studied region of x from the free case . when pion and rho cloud contributions as well as shadowing effect are also taken into account",
    "there is a further change of about @xmath253 at low y and this change decreases with the increase in y for x=0.2 - 0.3 . this difference becomes smaller with the increase in the value of x , for example at x=0.5 - 0.6 , it becomes less than @xmath254 for all values of y. similarly , in the case of antineutrino induced charged current process the change in the base results from the free nucleon scattering process is around @xmath255 at x=0.2 - 0.3 for studied region of y , which gets further modulated by @xmath256 at low values of y and significantly increases with the increase in the value of y when pion and rho cloud contributions and shadowing effects are incorporated . at higher values of x , the difference in the results obtained using the base calculation and the full calculation is negligibly small and the difference between the base results and the results for the free case is the same as in the case of neutrino .",
    "furthermore , calculations performed at nlo leads to better results . in the case of neutral current",
    "we have performed calculations at lo and observe that the difference between the base results and the results for the free case ( not shown here ) is @xmath255 at x=0.2 - 0.3 for neutrino as well as antineutrino induced processes . when pion and rho cloud contributions and shadowing effects are taken into account , results from base change to @xmath257 for neutrino case and for antineutrino induced process the change is @xmath258 at x=0.2 - 0.3 for all values of y. at higher x , when fermi motion , pauli blocking and nucleon correlation are taken into account , the results change by @xmath259 from the free results at all values of y for both neutrino as well as antineutrino induced processes .",
    "when pion and rho cloud contributions as well as shadowing effects are also considered , there is a further reduction of @xmath260 for neutrino induced process and @xmath261 for antineutrino case for all values of y. therefore , we observe that in the study of charged current and neutral current differential scattering cross sections medium effects are important .",
    "the pw ratio(@xmath238 ) , given by eq .",
    "( [ diff_ratio ] ) , is shown in fig.[rminus ] using the numerical values from charged and neutral current differential scattering cross sections in iron , treating it to be isoscalar as well as nonisoscalar nuclear targets , at different values of x for a fixed value of neutrino / antineutrino energy @xmath262=80 gev .",
    "we have incorporated fermi motion , pauli blocking and nucleon correlation while calculating @xmath238 .",
    "we find that @xmath238 is almost independent of x and y for an isoscalar target , while for the nonisoscalar target there is x as well as y dependence .",
    "we find that the nonisoscalarity and medium effect increase with the increase in the value of x , for example in the mid region of x it is about @xmath263 for low values of y and @xmath264 at higher values of y. therefore , for nonisoscalar targets like iron , medium effects and excess of neutrons strongly affect @xmath238 and hence @xmath265 . while for an isoscalar target like carbon(not shown here ) medium effects cancel out and extracted value of @xmath265 from pw ratio is in complete agreement with the global value .",
    "when the contributions of pion and rho clouds are also taken into account , we find that these changes do not bring any difference in the results of pw ratio as obtained with our base calculations . since shadowing is a low x phenomenon , we have not considered it in our present study of pw ratio  @xcite .",
    "to see the effect of nonisoscalarity in the iron target , we have plotted @xmath266 using eq .",
    "( [ deltarminus ] ) at @xmath267 gev in fig.[deltar ] .",
    "we find that the effect of nonisoscalarity is large at low y and high values of x which decreases with the increase in the value of y as well as this effect is smaller at low values of x. hence there is a nonisoscalarity dependence in the determination of @xmath268 . using the results of @xmath238 from eq .",
    "( [ diff_ratio ] ) and @xmath266 from eq .",
    "( [ deltarminus ] ) , we have obtained @xmath268 using eq .",
    "( [ correctioninpw ] ) and presented the results in fig .",
    "[ sintheta ] .",
    "the above calculated value of weak mixing angle is now corrected for isoscalar target where we should also keep in mind that the medium effects are still present .",
    "we find that due to medium effects @xmath268 is different from the global fit , and this difference is @xmath269 when evaluated for low value of y at x=0.2 and this decreases to @xmath254 at high values of y , while this change is @xmath270 when calculated for low y at x=0.6 and this reduces to @xmath271 at high values of y. thus we observe that nonisoscalarity as well as medium effects like pauli blocking , binding energy and fermi motion are important while extracting @xmath268 . to see the effect of neutrino energy @xmath272 and @xmath27 dependence on @xmath265 , we have plotted in fig.[sintheta_eq ] , @xmath265 as a function of x at various values of @xmath272 and @xmath27 .",
    "we observe that at @xmath272=80 gev and @xmath273 gev@xmath274 it is almost close to the standard value at low values of x , and the value of @xmath265 changes significantly with @xmath262 , @xmath8 and x. therefore , while looking at the nutev results it is also important to know at what values of x , @xmath272 and @xmath27 , the analysis was performed as a wide range of these variables could change considerably the value of @xmath268 .",
    "to summarize our results , in this work we have studied the effects of the nuclear - medium on the structure functions @xmath275 and @xmath276 in the iron nucleus treating it to be isoscalar nuclear target and then we have made non - isoscalarity corrections .",
    "we have used many - body theory to describe the spectral function of a nucleon in an infinite nuclear - medium .",
    "the spectral function takes into account the fermi motion and the binding energy of the nucleons .",
    "the spectral function also includes nucleon correlations . then to apply it to the case of finite nucleus we have used the local - density approximation .",
    "target mass corrections have also been considered .",
    "we have used cteq  @xcite pdfs in the numerical evaluation .",
    "we have taken into consideration the effects of mesonic degrees of freedom , of shadowing and anti - shadowing for the calculation of @xmath277 and for @xmath278 shadowing and antishadowing effects only .    with these structure functions ,",
    "we have evaluated numerically the differential scattering cross sections for the charged and neutral current induced ( anti)neutrino interactions on the iron target .",
    "these differential scattering cross sections are then used to study the nuclear medium effects and nonisoscalarity correction in the extraction of weak mixing angle sin@xmath0 using paschos - wolfenstein(pw ) relation .    beginning with a model for non - symmetric nuclear matter",
    ", we have expanded the nuclear hadron tensor in an isoscalar part plus nuclear corrections which are , roughly speaking , proportional to the difference between the neutron and the proton density profiles .",
    "we have performed this expansion for all the nuclear structure functions which appear in the paschos - wolfenstein ratio for differential cross sections and obtained the pure isoscalar paschos - wolfenstein result plus nuclear corrections which depend on the phase space bjorken variables .",
    "we have also observed that the paschos - wolfenstein ratio for isoscalar nuclear structure functions is almost independent of @xmath7 and @xmath109 , as it should be .",
    "however , when one considers the model for non - symmetric nuclei , such as @xmath237fe , one obtains a pw ratio which depends on the phase space variables .",
    "furthermore , we have evaluated the first order _ nuclear correction _ to the isoscalar pw ratio and found it to be important for a wide range of the phase space .",
    "can this _ nuclear correction _",
    "explain the nutev anomaly is a question that should be answered if one could weight our results for @xmath220 by the relative amount of events in every @xmath7 and @xmath109 bin , under the assumption of assigning all the correction to @xmath279 .",
    "another important point that may be taken into account is the fact that we have worked in the up and down quarks approximation .",
    "therefore , we have neglected the contribution coming from heavier flavors .",
    "we leave this subject for future studies .",
