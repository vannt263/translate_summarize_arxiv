    "stellar astrophysics , in many aspects , is based on precisely determined fundamental parameters of stars such as their masses and radii . with a few exceptions , only the eclipsing binaries of sb2 type",
    "enable us to determine directly those parameters with the required precision .",
    "hence such objects allow us to test the predictions of theoretical stellar evolution models .",
    "recent review papers about detached eclipsing binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) present the comparison between observations and theoretical models for late spectral type objects",
    ". systems containing stars in advanced stages of evolution ( e.g. , red giants ) are much less investigated than , for example , low - mass binaries ( which consist of dwarfs ) , also considered to be poorly studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , only a dozen of stars with subgiant and giant components in eclipsing binaries have been characterized in the milky way with the required masses and radii accuracy of 3% ( upper limit by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is indicative of their usefulness as test beds for theoretical models ( e.g. tz for , my cyg , hy vir ) .",
    "worth mentioning is also very informative system ai phe @xcite  a rare example of differential evolution .",
    "the combination of a main sequence star with one that is already at the lower giant branch is ideal for an empirical verification of the stellar evolution theoretical models .",
    "additionally , there are 12 extragalactic systems with well characterized giants discovered in lmc @xcite and smc @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these systems shows that our knowledge of the more advanced stages of stellar evolution ( following the main sequence phase ) is incomplete .",
    "an increasing number of observations of late type binaries have intensified theoretical work on stellar structure and evolution .",
    "however , we are still lacking high quality data . using high resolution spectrographs and available photometric measurements we can increase the sparse sample of giants with accurately determined parameters .",
    "in this paper we present the latest results of our on - going spectroscopic survey @xcite of eclipsing binaries from the _ _ all sky automated survey _ _ ( hereafter asas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we focus on three systems where both components are subgiant or giant stars .",
    "first we describe our targets , then its data collection and analysis , and finally the results we obtained .",
    "section 6 contains the discussion about the evolutionary status of the systems , and age and distance determination , while section 7 summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "the observing strategy included the selection of detached eclipsing binaries from the extensive _ asas catalogue of variable stars _",
    "( acvs ; * ? ? ? * ) and a spectroscopic campaign to infer the evolutionary status of every component and determine their physical and orbital parameters .",
    "the systems were selected on the basis of the following criteria : p @xmath1 8 days , change in brightness @xmath2 1  mag , _ v_-_k _ @xmath1 1  mag , in order to search for detached , non - algol systems with components of solar radius or larger .",
    "the analyzed sample include the binary systems : asas j010538 - 8003.7 , asas j182510 - 2435.5 , and v1980 sgr .",
    "the eclipsing binary asas j010538 - 8003.7 ( cd-80 28 , 2mass j01053817 - 8003409 , tyc 9355 - 177 - 1 , hereafter asas-010538 ) is classified as an eclipsing detached binary system ( deb ) in the acvs .",
    "its apparent _ v _ magnitude is 10.1 @xcite , and the amplitude of photometric variations in _ v_-band is 0.44 mag .",
    "the system was briefly analyzed by @xcite who pointed out that the binary components are subgiants and suggested its further investigation .      the eclipsing binary asas j182510 - 2435.5 ( tyc 6861 - 523 - 1 , hereafter asas-182510 ) is classified as a deb in the acvs .",
    "its apparent _ v _ magnitude is 10.87 @xcite .",
    "however , in the acvs it is estimated to be 10.56 .",
    "the reason for that significant difference is the additional visual component that contributes to the total brightness of the system ( third light ) inside an aperture used by the asas pipeline to measure the stellar flux .",
    "the amplitude of photometric variations in the asas _",

    "the residuals are shown in the lower panel . ]          to obtain a new spectroscopic solution for asas-010538 system we used 13 rv measurements for both components .",
    "four of them were already published @xcite , but we rejected one measurement due to low snr and high rv errors .",
    "three additional rv measurements were derived from giraffe spectra collected during an observing run in september 2010 , five more were obtained using the harps spectrograph in june and september , 2011 , two more come from spectra collected in august 2011 with chiron in service mode .",
    "we obtained 8 rv measurements for both components of asas-182510 system .",
    "four of them were derived from chiron spectra collected in july and september , 2011 ( service mode ) , two were obtained using coralie spectrograph in september 2011 and may 2012 , and two rv measurements were derived from two ccd chips ( blue and red ) on which the spectrum taken by the hds spectrograph at the subaru telescope ( august 2011 ) was recorded .",
    "we obtained 7 rv measurements for both components of asas-182525 system .",
    "two of them were derived from chiron spectra collected in july 2011 ( service mode ) , three were obtained using the coralie spectrograph in september 2011 and may 2012 , and two rv measurements come from the two separate ccd chips of the hds spectrograph ( august 2011 ) .",
    "we used the _ v_-band measurements of the selected system from the acvs .",
    "the data phase coverage is complete for all of the systems , and the data span is around 9 years ( hjd@xmath32451900 - 2455200 ) .",
    "we used 1089 , 797 , and 769 measurements for asas-010538 , asas-182510 , and asas-182525 , respectively .",
    "for asas-010538 this is more than used in the solution presented by @xcite .",
    "for ccd reduction , spectrum extraction and wavelength calibration for data from giraffe and hds spectrographs we used standard iraf procedures for echelle spectra .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done in the standard manner with thorium - argon lamp frames taken before and after object exposures ( giraffe ) or at the beginning and at the end of observing nights ( hds ) .",
    "we used the iraf _",
    "task for barycentric velocity corrections .",
    "the basic reduction , spectral extraction , and wavelength calibration of the spectra from the chiron spectrograph were done with the pipeline developed at yale university ( tokovinin et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration was based on the thorium - argon lamp exposure taken just before the science exposure with the same spectrograph settings .",
    "as the pipeline does not include barycentric velocity corrections , we used the _",
    "task for that purpose .",
    "data from the harps spectrograph were reduced using dedicated software ( _ data reduction software _ , _ drs _ ) which allows spectra to be reduced in near real - time .",
    "the pipeline performs barycentric corrections .",
    "the instrument works in a simultaneous wavelength calibration mode , so thorium - argon exposures are taken simultaneously with the exposure of an object .",
    "spectra from the coralie spectrograph were also taken in a simultaneous thorium - argon mode , where one of the fibres observes a target and the other an arc lamp .",
    "for the data reduction , calibration , and barycentric corrections we used an automated pipeline developed at pontificia universidad catlica de chile .",
    "it it briefly described in @xcite , a full description will be presented in an upcoming work ( jordan et al .",
    "2013 , in prep . ) .",
    "the rvs were calculated using our own implementation of the two dimensional cross - correlation technique ( todcor ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using as references various synthetic spectra computed with the atlas9 and atlas12 codes @xcite .",
    "the formal rv errors were computed from the bootstrap analysis of todcor correlation maps created by adding selected single - order maps . to obtain a best - fit with reduced @xmath4 @xmath5 1 to our rv data , we multiplied the formal errors by an appropriate factor .",
    "the rv measurements , their final errors ( formal errors multiplied by a calculated factor ) , and _ o_-__c__s are collected in tables [ rv_010538][rv_182525 ] in appendix a. the tables also include the exposure times and a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per collapsed pixel at @xmath6=5500   of each spectrum .",
    "as we work with heterogenous datasets , we checked if there is no differences between rv zero points from spectrographs we use . to deal with that , we fit an additional parameter , which allows to compensate for different zero points in the procedure we use to obtain preliminary results from rv measurements .",
    "initially , we set the parameter free and concluded the difference in rv zero points between spectrographs is insignificant and has no influence on the final results , thus the final fits were done with that parameter fixed to 0 .        * to obtain a preliminary solution from rv measurements we used a procedure that fits a double - keplerian rv orbit and minimizes the @xmath4 function with a levenberg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "every system components mass ratio was derived in this manner and applied in the further analysis . + * the light curve modelling was done with jktebop @xcite based on ebop ( _ eclipsing binary orbit program _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the code fits a geometric model of a detached eclipsing binary to a light curve in order to derive components and systems parameters .",
    "jktebop includes also an extensive monte carlo error analysis algorithm which was used to determine robust uncertainties in the parameters which the program derives .",
    "we checked the eccentricity for every system and concluded that all of the orbits are consistent with being circular , so we kept the eccentricity fixed at 0 for the further analysis .",
    "the parameters like the period and time of minimum ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 were much more precise than the quantities from the asas analysis presented in acvs ) , the inclination were calculated and applied to the repeated rv - keplerian orbit fitting procedure .",
    "we used jktebop to derive the fractional stellar radii of the components .",
    "+ * to estimate the semimajor axis , systemic velocity , luminosities , gravitational potentials , and effective temperatures of system components and deal with spots ( in the case of asas-182525 ) we used the phoebe code ( _ physics of eclipsing binaries _ ; * ? ? ? * ) - an implementation of the wilson - devinney code @xcite which uses the computed gravitational potential of each star to determine the surface gravity and effective temperatures . + * to derive absolute values and their uncertainties we used the procedure jktabsdim @xcite .",
