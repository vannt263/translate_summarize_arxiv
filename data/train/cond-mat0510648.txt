    "the temporal evolution of an interface during solidification has been under intensive study by physicists and material scientists for several decades .",
    "the interface velocity and shape have important consequences for practical metallurgy , as well as the theory , e.g. , velocity selection mechanism and nonlinear theory of interfaces .",
    "the simplest observed microstructure is the single needle crystal or dendrite , which is observed to be a shape resembling a paraboloid ( but not fully rotationally invariant away from the tip ) growing at a constant velocity , @xmath7 , with tip radius , @xmath8 .    an early model of this phenomenon by ivantsov",
    "@xcite stipulated the heat diffusion equation in one of the phases and imposed latent heat considerations at the interface . with",
    "the interface assumed to be at the melting temperature , the absence of an additional length scale implies the existence of an infinite spectrum of pairs of velocities and tip radii , @xmath9 .",
    "since the experimental results have shown that there is a unique pair @xmath9 that is independent of initial conditions , there has been considerable activity toward uncovering the theoretical mechanism for this velocity selection ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the emergence of the capillarity length associated with the surface tension as an additional length scale has provided an explanation for the selection mechanism .",
    "advances in computational power and a better understanding of interface models and their computation have opened up the possibility of comparing experimental values for the tip velocity with the numerical computations .",
    "this is nevertheless a difficult computational issue in part due to the large differences in length scales that range from @xmath10 for the size of the experimental region , to @xmath11 microns for the radius of curvature near the tip , @xmath12 for the capillarity length , to @xmath13 interface thickness length .",
    "one perspective into the theoretical and numerical study of such interfaces has been provided by the phase field model introduced in  @xcite in which a phase , or order parameter , @xmath14 , and temperature , @xmath15 , are coupled through a pair of partial differential equations described below ( see also more recent papers  @xcite ) . in physical terms , the width of the transition region exhibited by @xmath14 is angstroms . in the @xmath16",
    "s three key results facilitated the use of these equations for computation of physical phenomena .",
    "if the equations are properly scaled one can ( i ) identify each of the physical parameters , such as the surface tension , ( ii ) and attain the sharp interface problem as a limit  @xcite , and ( iii ) use the interface thickness , @xmath17 as a free parameter , since the motion of the interface is independent of this parameter  @xcite .",
    "this last result thereby opened the door to computations with realistic material parameters , by removing the issue of small interface thickness .",
    "however , the difference in scale between the radius of the curvature and overall dimensions still pose a computational challenge .",
    "more recently , several computations , have been done using the phase field model  @xcite , with some 3d computations in  @xcite utilizing the model and asymptotics of  @xcite , that will be compared with our results below .",
    "also , george  _ et al _ studied the simulation of dendritic growth in three dimensional space using a phase field model  @xcite .",
    "our work differs from the works referenced above in many aspects .",
    "however , the main difference arises from the adaptation of the experimental conditions in the simulation of dendritic growth .",
    "most importantly , we use true values of physical parameters which are obtained from the microgravity experiment for scn  @xcite . in order to deal with different length scales and the diffusion during freezing in the thin interfacial region ,",
    "we implement a fully parallel architecture in a three dimensional space which enables us to use enough grid points and perform an efficient calculation .",
    "solidification is a complicated nonlinear process .",
    "modeling necessarily involves making choices of physical effects that are to be included in the equations .",
    "comparison of computations with experiments that are closest to the mathematical model yields the most convincing test of the model and computations .",
    "the modeling of single - needle dendrites has usually been carried out using the diffusion equation as a mechanism for the dissipation of heat .",
    "however , all of the experiments until the space shuttle experiments had been done under conditions of normal gravity , so that convection in the liquid is an important mechanism for the dissipation of the latent heat released at the interface .",
    "the microgravity experiments performed on the space shuttle  @xcite provide the first opportunity to test whether the mathematical models agree with experiments , since the absence of gravity essentially eliminates convection , thereby leaving diffusion as the main mechanism for heat transport away from the interface .",
    "while numerous computer calculations have been performed on both sharp interface and phase field models of solidification , comparison with experiment has always been a difficulty due to the vastly different length scales in the problem ( e.g 10@xmath18 for capillarity length and @xmath10 for the overall dimensions of the experiment ) , and the three dimensional nature of the problem . in the absence of direct comparison with experiment , it is also difficult to know whether some of the simplifications that have been used , such as setting the kinetic coefficient , @xmath19 , to zero are valid .    in this paper",
    "we perform large scale 3d parallel computations of a phase field model with the modification introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the key aspects of these computations are summarized below .",
    "\\(a ) we perform fully three dimensional parallel computations by adopting the experimental conditions used in the space shuttle experiment .",
    "the symmetry is utilized only along the major axes ( rather than rotational symmetry ) .",
    "this allows us to compare the tip velocity with the actual experiments in a meaningful way .",
    "the calculations utilize the parameters and boundary conditions of the idge microgravity experiments for scn  @xcite . all previous experiments done under normal gravity conditions introduced convection .",
    "hence this provides an opportunity to compare experiments in the absence of convection to theory that also excludes convection .",
    "the difference between the experimental results and our computations thereby defines the challenges for additional physical effects that need to be modeled .",
    "\\(b ) the role of anisotropy in velocity selection has been noted in the computational references cited above .",
    "glicksman and singh  @xcite compare experimental tip velocity of scn with pivalic acid ( pva ) whose coefficient of surface tension anisotropy ( defined below ) differs by a factor of @xmath20 but are otherwise similar , except perhaps for the kinetic coefficient .",
    "we perform two sets of calculations in which all parameters are identical ( scn values ) except for the anisotropy coefficient .",
    "our computations confirm ( consistent with the experimental results  @xcite ) that the velocity is nearly identical when the magnitude of the anisotropy is varied by a factor of @xmath20 with all other parameters fixed ( at the scn values ) .",
    "\\(c ) most of the previous numerical computations that simulate the interface growth were done in two dimensional space .",
    "our computations shows that the 2d and 3d computations differ by a factor of approximately @xmath6 .",
    "the results of the 3d for tip velocity can also be compared with our previous computations  @xcite that utilized rotational symmetry to reduce the 3d computations to two computational spatial dimensions .",
    "\\(d ) the role of the kinetic coefficient [ see definition of @xmath21 below equation ( [ phase1 ] ) ] is subtle , and this material parameter is often set to zero , for convenience , in theoretical and computational studies .",
    "we find , however , that there is a significant difference in the tip velocity when all other parameters are held fixed while this coefficient is varied .",
    "consequently , this kinetic coefficient may be of crucial importance in determining the selection of tip velocity . a better understanding of this issue may lead to theory that can explain a broader range of undercooling and velocity .",
    "in the computations below , we use a version of the phase field equations introduced in  @xcite , for which the phase or order parameter , @xmath22 , as a function of spacial point , @xmath23 , and time , @xmath24 , is exactly @xmath25 in the solid and @xmath26 in the liquid .",
    "the order parameter is coupled with the dimensionless temperature , @xmath27 , which is given by the following relation along with the capillary length , @xmath28 .",

    "thus , we can define the interface by @xmath35 and write the dimensionless phase field equations as follows @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38    here , @xmath19 is the kinetic coefficient and @xmath39 is the interface thickness that can be used as a `` free parameter ''  @xcite . in the limit as @xmath39 vanishes as all other parameters held fixed , solutions to  ( [ phase1 ] ) and ( [ phase2 ] ) are governed by the sharp interface model @xmath40 @xmath41 _ { -}^{+}\\ ] ] @xmath42    where the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath43 and @xmath19 are the same as in the phase field model , and @xmath44 is the interface normal growth velocity  ( with normal @xmath45 chosen from solid ( @xmath46 ) to liquid ( @xmath47 ) )  @xcite .      in order to simulate interface growth of a dendrite in 3d",
    ", we choose a cube of @xmath48}^{3}$ ] which is assumed to be filled with pure scn melt initially .",

    "the temperature at the boundary is kept at constant undercooling value , @xmath50 , and the liquid temperature inside the chamber declines exponentially from @xmath51 on the interface of the seed to the boundary of the chamber . in particular , the initial conditions of @xmath27 inside the chamber are given by a plane wave solution to  ( [ sharp1 ] )  and  ( [ sharp2 ] ) which is given by @xmath52 , & z\\geq vt/|u_{\\infty}| \\\\      0 , & z < vt/|u_{\\infty}|      \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the signed distance from the seed interface  ( positive in the liquid ) and @xmath54 denotes the dimensionless undercooling value where  @xmath55 is the far field temperature .",
    "the initial value of @xmath14 is obtained from a leading term asymptotic expansion solution  @xcite @xmath56      anisotropy is important in determining the shape of dendrites that grow exclusively in the preferred directions .",
    "the experimental evidence shows conclusively that surface tension , @xmath33 , exhibits anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "while there is the possibility of dynamical ( i.e. , through @xmath19 in equation  ( [ phase1 ] ) or ( [ phase2 ] ) ) or other anisotropy the experimental measurements of anisotropy in these experiments are confined to those related to surface tension .",
    "surface tension anisotropy has been modeled in several ways .     which shows the effect of the anisotropy : ( a ) the position of the interface in 10 seconds ; ( b ) the position of the interface at latter times ( 135 sec , 140 sec , 145 sec and 150 sec).__,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]   which shows the effect of the anisotropy : ( a ) the position of the interface in 10 seconds ; ( b ) the position of the interface at latter times ( 135 sec , 140 sec , 145 sec and 150 sec).__,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    let @xmath57 be the normal to the interface .",
    "we utilize the simplest possible function describing the dependence of surface energy on @xmath45 in the case of an underlying cubic symmetry .",

    "the parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , can be related to usual measure of anisotropy strength , @xmath65 , by the relations @xmath66 and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "aysmptotic analysis  @xcite shows that with the anisotropy , the gibbs - thomson relation  ( [ sharp3 ] ) is modified not only in terms of the angles , but with their second derivatives . in our simulation",
    ", we assume that the dendrites grow along an axis of symmetry and set @xmath68 to be the mean curvature .",
    "thus , we can rewrite the gibbs - thomson equation  ( [ sharp3 ] ) as @xmath69 where @xmath70\\ ] ]",
    "a large number of mesh points are necessary in order to calculate the tip growth velocity and tip radius accurately .",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath14 across the interface vary from maximum to minimum within a short distance .",
    "this requires finer grid spacing so that number of mesh points is adequate to resolve the interfacial area .",
    "we make a physically reasonable but computationally very useful assumption that the dendrite grows symmetrically along the coordinate axes .",
    "thus , the computational domain is reduced to @xmath71^{3}$ ] which decreases the overall grid usage by @xmath72 . in this work",
    ", we use @xmath73 uniform grid points on each side of @xmath74 which guarantees that we have at least @xmath75-@xmath76 grid points located on the interface region as measured from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .    in order to discretize the equations  ( [ phase1 ] ) and  ( [ phase2 ] ) , let @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the discrete values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "we lag the nonlinear terms in  ( [ phase1 ] ) and discretize the equations  ( [ phase1 ] ) and  ( [ phase2 ] )  by using semi - implicit crank - nicolson finite difference method .",
    "thus , we write the discrete equations as follows : @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85    for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the operators such as @xmath88  and  @xmath89 in the equations  ( [ discrtephase1 ] )  and  ( [ discrtephase2 ] ) are the finite difference operators and they can be given as @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    "the comparison of the computational results with experiments makes sense only if we use the true value of the physical parameters . throughout the simulation , the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath92 for scn",
    "are set to be @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the diffusivity parameters , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , are almost the same for the liquid and solid scn .",
    "thus , we set the diffusivity @xmath43 to be @xmath97 which is the value for @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "all of the parameters in the phase field equations are physically measurable quantities , including @xmath39 which is a measure of the interface thickness .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the solutions of the phase field equations ( scaled in this form ) approach those of the sharp interface model  ( [ sharp1])-([sharp3 ] ) provided all other parameters are held fixed as @xmath39 approaches zero .",
    "the rate of convergence , however , emerges as a key issue .",
    "in particular , the true size of @xmath39 is a few atomic lengths , or angstrom , while the size of experimental region is at least @xmath98 . thus using",
    "the true value of @xmath39 would necessitate @xmath99 grid points in each direction yielding unfeasible computation . from a computational perspective",
    ", one needs to have at least several grid points in the interfacial region in order to accurately calculate the derivatives of order parameter that implicitly define the surface tension .",
    "a computational breakthrough was the discovery that @xmath39 could be made many orders of magnitude larger without influencing the interface motion .",
    "caginalp and socolovsky  @xcite showed that so long as one chooses an appropriate number of grid points in the interface region ( defined by the magnitude of @xmath39 and @xmath100 denotes the uniform grid size ) , guaranteed by the range @xmath101 , one can resolve the motion accurately .",
    "the only limitation then involves the interface thickness relative to the radius of curvature of the dendrites . in this work we set @xmath102 which falls into this range .",
    "the choice of the initial tip radius , @xmath49 , for a steady - state is not arbitrary .",
    "one needs to take into account the latent heat released at the interface . by choosing a sufficiently large distance between the interface and the boundary , the latent heat released at the interface diffuses to the liquid and",
    "the effect of the boundary becomes minimal . in order to guarantee enough distance to the boundary , the tip radius , @xmath49",
    ", should be at least @xmath103 times smaller than the diffusion length @xmath104 . in our calculation",
    ", we choose the tip radius to be @xmath105 for the choice of @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 where @xmath100 is the uniform grid size corresponding to the choice of each @xmath109 . under these conditions ,",
    "the diffusion length is large enough and satisfies the standard theoretical conditions for dendritic growth  @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation of the equations ( [ phase1 ] ) and  ( [ phase2 ] ) in 3d with any physical choice of parameters is a difficult task . of these difficulties ,",
    "the memory requirements and the cpu time are the main issues due to the difference in the length scales . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : memory ] , the demand for the memory is a delicate issue in that doubling the number of the grids will increase the computational memory as much as eight times , and slows down the performance of the code .",
    "this makes the numerical computation of  ( [ discrtephase1 ] ) and ( [ discrtephase2 ] ) with any physically appropriate choice of grid size impossible on serial computers .",
    "instead , one needs a parallel architecture in which the work will be distributed to many computers and the computational job will be shared among the computers ( processors ) allowing large scale computation .        the ratio @xmath6 can be put in perspective by examining the limiting sharp interface equations ( [ sharp1 ] ) and ( [ sharp2 ] ) .",
    "physical intuition suggests that the growth of the interface is limited mainly by the diffusion of the latent heat manifested in the condition ( [ sharp2 ] ) .",
    "when diffusion is rapid , the heat equation is approximated by laplace s equation , whose radial solutions are of the form @xmath110 .",
    "the latent heat condition ( [ sharp2 ] ) implies that the normal velocity is proportional to the gradient , or @xmath111 . comparing this term for @xmath112 versus @xmath113",
    ", one has a ratio of @xmath114 .",
    "analogously , if we examine the gibbs - thomson relation alone , and solve ( [ sharp3 ] ) for the normal velocity , we see that dimensionality arises ( directly ) in terms of @xmath115 , the sum of principal curvatures , which is @xmath116 where @xmath49 is the radius of curvature .",
    "hence this factor would suggest that at least one of the terms in this expression for the velocity has a coefficient @xmath117 , suggesting a ratio of @xmath118 .",
    "thus a heuristic examination of the key limiting equations suggests that the tip velocity in @xmath119 should be about @xmath120 to @xmath121 times that of the @xmath122 system .",
    "of course there are numerous nonlinearities involved in the equations that could alter this ratio .",
    "our calculations fall well in the range @xmath120 to @xmath121 , thereby lending some support to the heuristics above .",
    "the fully three dimensional calculations also allow a complete treatment of the anisotropy as it is manifested in both directions ( see equation  [ surfacetensionn ] ) . while the immediate area near the tip of the dendrite appears to be symmetric about the direction of growth ,",
    "the photographs of experiments show that there is significant asymmetry a short distance away from the tip .",
    "consequently , there is some question as to the accuracy of rotationally symmetric computations ( reducing the 3d problem to one which is a 2d computation ) .",
    "however , we find that this asymmetry influences the tip velocity by only 8 - 10% .",
    "nevertheless this anisotropy can be expected to play a key role in the development of sidebranching for which the axial symmetry appears to be significant .    to verify the effect of the surface tension anisotropy on the interface growth , we use four different anisotropy levels , @xmath123 ,  @xmath124 ,  @xmath125  and  @xmath126 for the undercooling value @xmath127 .",
    "corresponding growth velocities are  @xmath128 ,  @xmath129 ,  @xmath130 and  @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the influence of the anisotropy on the shape of the interface is more clear compared to the effects on the growth velocity(see",
    "fig  [ fig : contourplots ] ) .",
    "an order of magnitude change in the anisotropy strength does not change tip velocity significantly which confirm the experimental result  @xcite as well as the results from rotational symmetry case we studied in  @xcite .",
    "we also observe that the tip of the interface becomes sharper in the preferred direction as the strength of the anisotropy increases .",
    "as indicated in experiments , theory and computational studies  @xcite , the average growth rate of a single needle - crystal in 3d approaches a constant value .",
    "we examine this issue by using the undercooling value , @xmath132 , for scn .",
    "the average growth velocities at different time steps are calculated with the anisotropy strength @xmath133 .",
    "the growth velocity approaches a constant value as @xmath134 gets larger ( see fig  [ fig : vellargetime ] ) which confirms previous computational and theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "we have performed all of our calculations on the terascale computing system , lemieux , at pittsburgh super computing center .",
    "lemieux consists of @xmath135 compaq alphaserver @xmath136 nodes and two separate front end nodes .",
