    "one of the most interesting recent observations in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion physics was the suppressed yield of moderately high @xmath3 neutral pions in central au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 130  gev with respect to appropriately scaled p+p results  @xcite , in contrast to a strong enhancement observed at lower beam energies  @xcite .",
    "this was qualitatively supported by the observation of a suppression in non - identified charged hadron yields  @xcite . among the theoretical studies on the origin of the observed high @xmath3 deficit",
    "@xcite , most are based on the early prediction  @xcite of the so - called jet quenching , i.e. the energy loss of fast partons induced by a hot and dense quark - gluon - plasma .",
    "others invoke initial state parton saturation  @xcite or final state hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "while these different scenarios are being discussed , the interpretation is complicated by the parallel observation of a comparably large proton and antiproton yield at intermediate momenta  @xcite , which are apparently not similarly suppressed .",
    "these observations have been confirmed by the new measurements at @xmath1 = 200  gev  @xcite , which extend out to considerably higher transverse momenta for the pion measurement .",
    "simultaneously , there are a number of hints from the rhic experiments that equilibration may be achieved already in an early state and that the behavior of the system might at least partly be described by hydrodynamics , most notably the observation of strong elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "also the hadron momentum spectra can be described by hydrodynamic calculations and parameterizations quite well in the low and intermediate momentum range  @xcite . in particular , the large ( anti)proton / pion ratio",
    "can easily be explained by such calculations . while at very high @xmath0 the influence of hydrodynamic production should become negligible ,",
    "in the intermediate momentum range there will be a smooth transition from hydrodynamic behavior to hard scattering .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study the implications of hydrodynamic particle production for the interpretation of the pion suppression .    in the present paper",
    "i will attempt to describe hadron spectra with a parameterization combining hydrodynamic components and components similar to the original particle production in p+p collisions .",
    "this is considered a simple approximation to the more complicated real situation in heavy ion collisions , where , even if hydrodynamics is relevant for a large fraction of the particle spectra , there will always be some non - equilibrium contribution e.g. from the surface of the collision zone . in reality ,",
    "part of this would likely be intermediate in shape between true p+p spectra and hydrodynamics , but it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt to describe the full non - equilibrium nature of these collisions .",
    "the calculations should nevertheless provide a better understanding of the hadron spectra than pure hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of an explicit hard component will allow to describe the spectra out to high @xmath0 .",
    "the present paper uses an extension of the hydrodynamical parameterization of @xcite , which includes effects of transverse flow and resonance decays .",
    "it was originally based on a computer program by wiedemann and heinz @xcite , which in turn builds upon @xcite .",
    "it parameterizes the particle source at freeze - out as : @xmath4 the integral over @xmath5 contains a woods - saxon spatial profile with a diffuseness parameter @xmath6 and the two bessel functions which originate from the boost of a thermal distribution with a transverse collective velocity .",
    "the transverse expansion is described by a transverse rapidity , which is parameterized as @xmath7 , i.e. depending linearly on the normalized radial coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "i fix @xmath9 which yields a nearly box - like spatial shape of the source , as this has been shown to be a reasonable assumption @xcite . a fixed upper limit ( @xmath10 )",
    "has to be chosen for the numerical integration , for the distribution used in this work this is effectively equivalent to setting the upper limit to infinity . a spin degeneracy factor",
    "is included , and there is an additional arbitrary normalization factor @xmath11 , which is the same for all particle species and controls the relative strength of the hydrodynamical component . while the spectral shape is a.o . determined by the kinetic temperature @xmath12",
    ", the normalization for each particle species is readjusted to the chemical temperature @xmath13 assuming that @xmath14 at midrapidity scales with the temperature as @xcite : @xmath15 the parameterization attempts to describe the production of pions , protons and antiprotons and kaons ; it includes contributions from the following resonances : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath6 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 . for the description of baryons a baryonic chemical potential @xmath23",
    "is used , while for strange particles an additional strangeness suppression factor @xmath24 is introduced . for each hadron",
    "species the spectrum of hydrodynamically produced particles @xmath25 is given as the sum of the direct contribution and those of the appropriate resonances : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the invariant mass , @xmath28 the rapidity and @xmath29 the transverse mass of the resonance , and @xmath30 is the appropriate phase space factor .       as measured by the phenix experiment @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ppfit ]    as suggested by hagedorn @xcite , hadron spectra in high energy p+p collisions can be described by a qcd - inspired power law with exponential continuation at lower momenta .",
    "such a spectral shape can be written as : @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are adjustable parameters .",
    "@xmath33 is related to the more frequently used parameter @xmath34 by : @xmath35 .",

    "these distributions contain a component due to hard scattering processes , which is expected to lead to a power law shape dominating at high @xmath0 . at low @xmath0 production from string fragmentation , a soft process ,",
    "will be much more abundant and therefore dominate there .",
    "for the later description of spectra in heavy - ion reactions i will attempt to separate the two components , although a clear separation directly from the spectra is not possible .",
    "however , the exponential shape at low @xmath0 is believed to be due to the soft component , while at very high @xmath0 the shape will turn into a pure power law @xmath40 .",
    "the separation is of course completely arbitrary when looking at the fit to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppfit ] alone .",
    "in fact , there the exponential is not even fitted directly to the data and is only determined as the differentiable continuation of the shape at higher @xmath0 .",
    "the value of the separation point @xmath36 is not uniquely determined , but it yields a reasonable inverse slope parameter for the exponential .    the separation is necessary for a comparison to heavy ion collisions , because the different physical origin of the two components will lead to different scaling behavior , as the number of hard collisions increases more rapidly with increasing mass of the nuclei than the number of strings , i.e. the number of participant pairs .",
    "i will assume the soft contribution to be described by the exponential : @xmath41 after subtraction of this part the hard component can be written as : @xmath42 &   p_{t } > p_{t1 } ,       \\end{array }      \\right .",

    "this parameterization with a subtracted exponential may look artificial .",
    "one should remember , however , that already the original _ power - law - like _ shape suggested by hagedorn was an effective parameterization which turns into a power law for very high @xmath0 .",
    "the deviation from the power law at lower momenta , also to be seen as a variation of the exponent with momentum , was not derived from underlying principles , but chosen to describe the experimental data .",
    "the hard component introduced here is equivalent at high @xmath0 and takes into account partial contributions of a soft component at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "the pion spectrum is : @xmath44 this is essentially only a rewriting of equation  [ eq : pppar1 ] .",
    "the main purpose of this separation is the possibility to scale the two components independently when increasing the system size by going to heavy - ion collisions . in nave pictures of particle production the hard component",
    "is expected to increase with the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions , as cross sections are small and processes are incoherent .",
    "the soft component , however , will more likely scale with the number of participating nucleons as suggested by the wounded nucleon model .",

    "one of the major observations in this paper was , that the @xmath0-dependent ratios of different hadron species were to a good approximation independent of the beam energy studied .",
    "the kaon , proton and antiproton spectra have thus been tuned to reproduce the observed ratios .",
    "this has been achieved by using for kaons : @xmath46 for protons : @xmath47 and for antiprotons : @xmath48 the analytic expressions have been chosen because they can conveniently describe the shapes observed experimentally , they have no physical significance .",
