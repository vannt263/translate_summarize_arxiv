    "particle colliders and ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) experiments are at present the best scenarios to test the deep structure of matter and the interactions of its fundamental constituents at the frontier of energy . to this end",
    ", detailed modeling of the underlying physics , based on simulation programs also known as event generators , are required .",
    "these models are very important tools to define experimental and analysis strategies , to test new theoretical ideas and to design new experiments .    from the perspective of particle physics ,",
    "uhecr interactions are orders of magnitude beyond what can be achieved in current ( and future ) terrestrial collider experiments and may open a window to energy and kinematic regions previously unexplored in the study of fundamental interactions .",
    "the pierre auger collaboration , exploding the potential of the hybrid design of the observatory ( ground based and fluorescence detectors ) has developed a method to obtain the energy spectrum which does not rely on detailed numerical simulations extrapolated from experimental knowledge of man - made accelerators to the highest cosmic ray energies @xcite .",
    "the hybrid detection provides a way to inter - calibrate the subsystems and to control systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this new approach to derived the cosmic ray spectrum will allow to constrain , although in an indirect manner , interaction models at energies and phase space regions that complement those of colliders experiments .",
    "for the case of primary composition determination , however , uhecr data are interpreted in all cases using monte carlo simulations  @xcite",
    ".    the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , currently under construction at cern , will provide @xmath2 collisions at the unprecedented centre - of - mass energy of @xmath3 = 14 tev and luminosity of @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "it will also provide heavy ion collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of about 1000 tev .",
    "a good description of both hard and soft processes in event generators at lhc energies are very important to understand the _ underlying event _ associated with high transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) jets or leptons as well as _",
    "minimum bias events_. these events will be responsible for most of the radiation background expected at lhc experiments and hence it is essential to study detector damages , triggering systems , detector counting rates , etc .",
    "_ minimum bias events _ are worthy os scientific study as they provide a good insight into the internal structure of protons .",
    "in addition , dedicated runs of the lhc with lower luminosity ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) and specially tuned beam optics are planned to study diffractive events .",
    "both atlas@xcite and cms@xcite experiments are planning to implement additional detectors to cover the forward diffractive regions with tracking and/or calorimetry @xcite .",
    "recently , a new experiment to study very forward particle emission in the lhc collider , lhcf , has ben approved .",
    "the experimental results of lhcf will be able to provide the production spectum of secondary particles in the very forward region , allowing to constrain the monte carlo codes @xcite .",
    "moreover , novel aspects of diffraction studies are included in the physics case for forward proton tagging at 420 m at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a study of diffraction must use detectors with excellent forward acceptance to allow for a comparison with cosmic ray data .",
    "a good review of diffractive physics can be found in ref.@xcite , while references @xcite focus on future studies at lhc .    in this paper",
    "we present a comparative study between the two most frequently applied models for simulation of cosmic rays extensive air showers sibyll @xcite and qgsjet @xcite with a multi - purpose monte carlo like pythia @xcite tunned for use in lhc experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the main features of the models used in the monte carlo generators for @xmath0 collisions with emphasis in the most distinctive differences among them are presented . the method and the results from the monte carlo studies at lhc center of mass energy with the aim of discriminating between the different models",
    "are described in section iii with two parts . in the first part , predictions for the most relevant distributions in studies of both collider and uhecr data are discussed . in the second part a comparative analysis of the signatures from diffractive events is presented .",
    "final comments and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "although electromagnetic and weak interactions are well understood , this is not the case for hadron production in collisions of nucleons , pions and kaons with light nuclei , where the lack of experimental data posses limitations in many uhecr and accelerator applications @xcite .",
    "this is mainly because precise perturbative quantum chromo - dynamics ( pqcd ) calculations are only possible for processes with large momentum transfer , also known as `` hard '' interactions , that constitute only a minute fraction of the overall reaction rate . in hadron - hadron interactions it is customary to distinguish between elastic and inelastic processes , and this later into diffractive ( including single and double diffraction ) and non - diffractive ones ( usually called _ minimum bias events _ ) .",
    "precisely , low-@xmath6 ( `` soft '' ) processes , where pqcd can not be fully applied and phenomenology models are used , play a dominant role in the non - diffractive component .",
    "current models of high energy hadron collisions typically rely on the pqcd formalism in the description of high-@xmath6 scattering , while treating the low-@xmath6 ones in a simplified phenomenological approach . at the lhc , the description of the new physics processes to be studied",
    "are mostly controlled by pqcd .",
    "some efforts have been done to investigate the models used by the most popular collider event generators , like pythia , to describe `` soft '' interactions in hadron - hadron collisions with the aim of predicting _ minimum bias _ and _ underlying event _ levels of particle production at the lhc @xcite .",
    "these studies resulted in a tuning of pythia based on comparisons of experimental data that is used in this paper .",
    "the pqcd inclusive cross section of production of parton jets pairs with transverse momenta larger than some cutoff @xmath9 is given by ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fractions of the momenta of the parent hadrons carried by the partons which collide , @xmath13 is the cross section for scattering of partons of types @xmath14 and @xmath15 according to elementary qcd diagrams , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mandelstam variables for this parton - parton process , and the sum is over all parton species .    in the uhecr field , the required information to model the interaction of the primary particle entering in the atmosphere appears to be extremely sensitive to the underlying `` soft '' non perturbative hadronic process @xcite . in this direction , there are three event generators , sibyll@xcite , qgsjet@xcite and dpmjet@xcite which are tailored specifically for simulation of hadronic interactions up to the highest cosmic ray energies .",
    "the most frequently used high energy hadronic models in the study of uhecrs are qgsjet and sibyll . in these codes , the low @xmath20 interactions are modeled by the exchange of pomerons .",
    "regge singularities are used to determine the momentum distribution functions of the various sets of constituents , valence and sea quarks .",
    "both qgsjet and sibyll share the eikonal model and then assume the unitarized cross sections assuming a real eikonal function sum of a soft and hard contributions : _ inel = d^2 ( 1 - \\{-2_s(s , ) - 2_h(s , ) } ) at high energies the hard eikonal is dominating : _",
    "qcd(s , p_t^ ) a(s , ) , where the normalized profile function @xmath21 describes the distribution of partons in the plane transverse of the collision axis .",
    "qgsjet and sibyll take different assumptions on the profile function which determines the inelastic cross section and its energy dependence .",
    "+ qgsjet assumes a gaussian profile distribution and its theory is formulated entirely in terms of pomeron exchanges .",
    "the basic idea is to replace the soft pomeron by a so - called semihard pomeron , defined to be an ordinary soft pomeron with the middle piece replaced by a qcd parton ladder .",
    "thus , minijets will emerge as a part of the semihard pomeron , which is itself the controlling mechanism for the whole interaction .    in sibyll",
    "the profile function is based on the fourier transform of the electromagnetic form factor and it is an energy - independent exponential .",
    "the underlying idea behind sibyll is that the increase in the cross section is driven by the production of minijets .",
    "the probability distribution for obtaining n jet pairs ( with @xmath22 , being @xmath23 a sharp threshold on the transverse momentum below which hard interactions are neglected ) in a collision at energy @xmath3 is computed regarding elastic @xmath0 or @xmath24 scattering as a diffractive shadow scattering associated with inelastic processes .",
    "the algorithms are tuned to reproduce the central and fragmentation regions data up to @xmath24 collider energies , and with no further adjustments they are extrapolated several orders of magnitude .",
    "a general update of qgsjet has been recently presented , where the key improvement is connected to an account for non - linear interaction effects in individual hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "additionally , a more reliable low mass diffraction treatment has been used and all model parameters have been re - calibrated using a wider set of accelerator data .",
    "this results in a new model , qgsjet - ii .",
    "non - linear screening corrections appear to be correlated with corresponding parton densities and become larger at higher energies , smaller impact parameters , resulting in the saturation of pdf s at the scale @xmath9 and in a considerable reduction of `` soft '' particle production .    in the case of pythia",
    ", perturbative qcd is used extending it for the case of low - pt .",
    "pqcd is divergent for @xmath25 , pythia avoids the divergence using two different scenarios.the `` simple scenario '' consists in fixing a minimum value of @xmath23 below which the cross section is defined as null and can be interpreted as the inverse of some color screening length in the hadron .",
    "this is equivalent to set a maximum impact parameter @xmath26 above which there is no more interaction . in the so called `` complex scenario '' a regulating parameter @xmath27",
    "is introduced below which the cross sections are dumped .",
    "different models of matter distribution in the hadron are considered : uniform , simple gaussian and double gaussian .",
    "the transition process from asymptotically free partons to colour - neutral hadrons is describes in all codes by string fragmentation models @xcite .    in summary",
    ", there are differences between the models for hadronic collisions in the existing event generators that will emerge in the monte carlo study presented in the rest of this paper .",
    "for analyzing the difference between models , we have generated samples of @xmath28 @xmath0 collisions at the lhc center - of - mass energy for each event generator model : qgsjet - ii @xcite , qgsjet-01 @xcite , sibyll 2.1 @xcite and pythia 6.205 @xcite .",
    "all calculations contain a mixture of diffractive and non - diffractive events according to the model used .",
    "all secondary particles were registered without any energy cut .    in the case of pythia , it was chosen the `` complex scenario '' with a double gaussian distribution of matter inside the hadron .",
    "the default values of some parameters were modified according to the results of references @xcite where the optimal values where obtained from a tunned pythia using events from different experiments . in the following table",
    "both default and tunned values of pythia as used in this paper are presented :    .values of relevant pythia 6.2 parameters . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as mentioned above , in hadron - hadron interactions the inelastic processes are usually divided into diffractive and non - diffractive . in this section ,",
    "a study of the predicted signatures from different models for diffractive hadronic interactions is presented .",
    "a good parameter for tangling diffractive events from @xmath0 collisions is the inelasticity defined as : k_l = 1 - where @xmath29 is the energy of the incident particle in the lab frame , and @xmath30 is the energy of the secondary with largest energy ( the so - called leading particle ) .",
    "a signature that can be used to distinguish diffractive from non - diffractive events is their low value in both inelasticity and number of secondaries @xcite . in table",
    "ii the value of the average inelasticity for each model is shown , while the corresponding inelasticity distributions are displayed in fig .",
    "a narrow peak at low @xmath31 is evident from this plot , which corresponds to elastic and single diffractive processes . for non - diffractive events ,",
    "the available energy is shared among many secondaries leading to a rather uniform distribution in the whole range of @xmath31 .    )",
    "the solid line corresponds to pythia 6.2 , dotted line to qgsjet-01 , dashed line to sibyll2.1 and dashed - dotted one to qgsjet - ii . ]",
    "a few differences between models can be seen in the inelasticity distribution : pythia has the highest diffractive peak .",
    "qgsjet-01 also presents a small peak at large @xmath32 due to the large number of secondaries produced in inelastic collisions .",
    "qgsjet - ii has no longer that feature .",
    "sibyll and pythia distributions are in general good agreement .    a close inspection of the multiplicity for single diffractive , double diffractive and non - diffractive events using pythia indicates that cutting at multiplicity below 40 the diffractive events largely dominates the sample . however , a cut in low inelasticity ( @xmath33 ) leave an even more pure diffractive sample .",
    "we will then label as `` diffractive '' events the ones with inelasticity @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ nsklow ] the distribution of charged particles , @xmath34 , for @xmath33 is presented .",
    "both qgsjet-01 and sibyll distributions barely goes further than 40 secondaries , while qgsjet - ii and pythia extend up to 60 secondaries .",
    "figure [ diff ] shows particle densities distributed in pseudorapidity space for `` diffractive '' events .",
    "there are large divergencies between pythia and sibyll in the predictions of the particle multiplicity in the whole region of @xmath35 .",
    "pythia predicts a density roughly 80 % greater than sibyll .",
    "qgsjet-01 shows a rather flat distribution at intermediate values between pythia and sibyll , while the new version qgsjet - ii is in good agreement with pythia at @xmath36 and present smaller values at @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the cuts @xmath33 and @xmath38 in the pythia sample allow selection of a pure sample of single diffractive events .    ) . ]",
    "the transverse momentum , @xmath20 , detection capabilities at atlas and cms with good resolution will be limited to particles with @xmath39 gev @xcite where for the labeled `` diffractive '' events qgsjet - ii and pythia show the largest difference .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ diffpt ] where the @xmath20 distribution of eventsin the central region ( @xmath40 ) is shown . at low momenta @xmath41 is greater for pythia , but as @xmath20 increases densities for the other models become greater with a difference of an order of magnitud at @xmath42 for the case of qgsjet - ii , as pythia does not create diffractive events with high transverse momemtum .",
    "distribution for the selected `` diffractive''events . ]",
    "figure [ 2dlow ] shows 2-d distributions of the number of secondaries in the labeled `` diffractive '' events vs. pseudorapidity .",
    "again , it is evident that the distributions generated by sibyll are fundamentally different to the ones from qgsjets and pythia .",
    "this is certainly due to the phenomenological description of diffractive events in sibyll @xcite . qgsjet-01 and qgsjet - ii predict a large fraction of events with low number of secondaries in the region of high pseudorapidity",
    ". clearly , the better treatment of diffraction for the case of qgsjet - ii with its parameters tunned using accelerator data , results in diffractive peaks much lower than in qgsjet-01 , but still larger compared with pythia data .    ) events .",
    "top - left panel corresponds to qgsjet - ii , top - right panel corresponds to qgsjet-01 , bottom - left panel to sibyll 2.1 and bottom - right panel to pythia 6.2 . ]",
    "the two most widely used high energy hadronic interaction models for the study of cosmic rays , sibyll and qgsjet , and the most popular simulation program for collider experiments , pythia , have been compared at lhc center of mass energy .",
    "these codes using different theoretical models involving many variables have different predictions for the most important observables , such as particle multiplicities , distribution of particles in pseudorapidity space and transverse momentum distribution , allowing to investigate , and improve , the theoretical predictions of hadron - hadron interactions at this energy .    the discrepancies observed in the pseudorapidity distributions for different types of particle , in particular in the acceptance region of lhc experiments would allow to perform a combined analysis to constrain the models , using the large _ minimum bias events _ statistics that will be collected in the very first lhc operation .",
    "the predictions for the 2-d distributions of particle multiplicity vs pseudorapidity will also help deciding on the best theoretical model .    measurements of hadron production with the forward detectors attached to lhc experiments are very important for a better understanding of the simulations that model soft hadronic interactions at high energies .",
    "the analysis of the percentage frequency of the leading particle produced in the collision indicates differences up to a factor of 2 for meson production .",
    "a selection of events from @xmath0 collisions at @xmath43 with small inelasticity ( @xmath33 ) and low number of secondaries allows to pick diffractive events for a comparative study of the various models .",
    "the analysis of particle densities in pseudorapidity space indicates a good agreement of predictions using pythia and qgsjet - ii and a clear deficit of particle densities using sibyll and to less extent qgsjet-01 .",
    "the @xmath20 distributions in the central pseudorapidity region clearly indicate that sybyll and qgsjet models create up to an order of magnitude more particles with large @xmath20 than pythia",
    ". a comparison with experimental data will provide strong constrains in modeling diffractive physics .",
    "the lack of suitable accelerator data is the dominant source of systematic uncertainties in the analysis of the extensive air shower data . at the same time , analysis of",
    "_ minimum bias events _ at lhc are very important for understanding the _ underlying event _ and commissioning studies for lhc detectors .",
    "certainly , the discrepancies in the models discussed in this paper will be naturally reduce with the large statistics of interesting data at a completely new energy frontier for terrestrial colliders , as lhc , and cosmic ray experiments , as the pierre auger observatory .",
