    "consider an irreducible closed algebraic curve @xmath8 ( in the sequel we simply write @xmath9 for @xmath10 ) .",
    "this curve is projected onto several projective planes embedded in @xmath11 through several center of projections , say @xmath12 .",
    "each projection mapping , denoted by @xmath13 is presented as a @xmath14 matrix , @xmath15 defined modulo multiplication by non - zero scalar .",
    "then each point @xmath16 different from @xmath17 is mapped by @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",

    "when we consider the problem of recovering the projections maps from the projected curves , we will show that the recovery is possible only modulo some action of the group of projective transformations of @xmath11 on the set of projection maps . to define this action we refer to a projection map as a point in @xmath20 .",
    "assume that we have @xmath22 projections , consider the following projective variety @xmath23 .",

    "we first investigate the case of two projections . given the projected curves @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the only data , our first problem is to compute the characteristic matrix ( to be defined below ) of two projections maps , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , up to a finite - fold ambiguity .",
    "it is shown that this is equivalent to find a necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath0 for the action of @xmath35 to have a finite number of orbits .",

    "more precisely each orbit induces a curve embedded in @xmath11 containing two irreducible components , one of degree @xmath4 and the other of degree @xmath2 .",

    "a simple lower bound of the minimal number of projections is simply deduced .    with the variety of lines intersecting @xmath0 another problem is also handled .",

    "this shows that in order to characterize a couple of projections modulo the action @xmath35 , we only need to compute the fundamental matrix . in the sequel",
    "we show how to recover @xmath66 from two projections of an algebraic curve .",

    "first we want to recover the fundamental matrix of the couple @xmath93 from the projected curve @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we shall mention of set of well known facts about generic projection .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth irreducible algebraic embedded in @xmath11 and @xmath96 its projection on a generic plane through a center of projections , @xmath43 .    1",
    ".   the curve @xmath96 will always contain singularities .",
    "furthermore for a generic position of the center of projection , the only singularities of @xmath96 will be nodes .",
    "2 .   the _ class _ of a planar curve is defined to be the degree of its dual curve . let @xmath97 be the class of @xmath96 .",

    "hence the genus , the degree and the class are related by @xmath100      we are ready now to investigate the recovery of the fundamental matrix of a couple of projections @xmath93 when the only knowledge is made of the projections of a smooth irreducible curve .    as before ,",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth irreducible curve embedded in @xmath11 , which can not be embedded in a plane .",

    "we will need to consider the two following mappings : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the join operator @xcite , which is equivalent to the cross - product in that case .",
    "both maps are defined on the first projection plane .",

    "[ theokrupeq ] for a generic position of the centers of projections with respect to the curve @xmath0 , there exists a non - zero scalar @xmath112 , such that for all points @xmath63 in the projection plane , the following equality holds : @xmath113 for reasons that will be clear later , we shall call this equation , the _ generalized kruppa equation_.    let @xmath114 be the set of epipolar lines tangent to curve in image @xmath115 .",
    "we start with the following lemma :    the two sets @xmath116 and @xmath117 are projectively equivalent .",
    "moreover for each corresponding pair of epipolar lines @xmath118 , the multiplicities of @xmath119 and @xmath120 as points of @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the same .",

    "thus we have @xmath126",
    ". moreover if @xmath127 is the set of planes in @xmath128 tangent to the curve in space , then there exists a one - to - one mapping between @xmath127 and each @xmath114 which leaves the multiplicities unchanged .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "this lemma implies that both sides of equation [ extkrupeq ] define the same algebraic set , that is the the union of epipolar lines tangent to @xmath31 . since @xmath110 and @xmath111 , in the generic case , have the same degree ( as stated in [ subsec : singleview ] ) , each side can be factorized as follows : @xmath129 where @xmath130 . by the previous lemme",
    "we also have : @xmath131 for all @xmath115 .",
    "by eliminating the scalar @xmath112 from the generalized kruppa equation ( [ extkrupeq ] ) we obtain a set of bi - homogeneous equations in @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "hence they define a variety in @xmath132 .",
    "we turn our attention to the dimensional analysis of this variety .",
    "our concern is to exhibit the conditions for which this variety is discrete . from a practical point of view , this is a step toward the recovery of the original curve .",

    "our first concern is to determine whether all solutions of equation ( [ extkrupeq ] ) are admissible , that is whether they satisfy the usual constraint @xmath134 .",
    "indeed we prove the following statement :    as long as there are at least 2 distinct lines through @xmath67 tangent to @xmath31 , equation ( [ extkrupeq ] ) implies that @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the variety defined by @xmath137 is then a union of at least 2 distinct lines through @xmath67 .",
    "if equation ( [ extkrupeq ] ) holds , @xmath138 must define the same variety .",
    "there are 2 cases to exclude : if @xmath139 , then the curve defined by @xmath138 is projectively equivalent to the curve defined by @xmath111 , which is @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , it is irreducible .    if @xmath140 or @xmath141 and @xmath142 , then there is some @xmath143 , not a multiple of @xmath67 , such that @xmath144 .",
    "then the variety defined by @xmath145 is a union of lines through @xmath143 . in neither case",
    "can this variety contain two distinct lines through @xmath67 , so we must have @xmath141 and @xmath146 .    as a result , in a generic situation every solution of @xmath147",
    "is admissible .",
    "let @xmath148 be the subvariety of @xmath149 defined by the equations @xmath150 together with @xmath136 and @xmath151 , where @xmath61 is the second epipole .",
    "we next compute a lower bound on the dimension of @xmath148 , after which we will be ready for the calculation itself .",
    "[ prop : lowerbound ] if @xmath148 is non - empty , the dimension of @xmath148 is at least @xmath152 .",
    "choose any line @xmath119 in @xmath153 and restrict @xmath67 to the affine piece @xmath154 .",
    "let @xmath155 be homogeneous coordinates on @xmath119 .",
    "if @xmath136 , the two sides of equation ( [ extkrupeq ] ) are both unchanged by replacing @xmath63 by @xmath156 .",
    "so equation ( [ extkrupeq ] ) will hold for all @xmath63 if it holds for all @xmath157 .",
    "therefore equation ( [ extkrupeq ] ) is equivalent to the equality of 2 homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath97 in @xmath158 and @xmath159 , which in turn is equivalent to the equality of @xmath160 coefficients . after eliminating @xmath112",

    ". therefore , @xmath148 is at least @xmath165-dimensional .    for the calculation of the dimension of @xmath148",
    "we introduce some additional notations . given a triplet @xmath166 , let @xmath167 ( respectively @xmath168 ) be the tangency points of the epipolar lines through @xmath169 ( respectively @xmath61 ) to the first ( respectively second ) projected curve .",

    "if @xmath186 is a function on @xmath180 , @xmath187 will denote the derivative of @xmath186 in the direction defined by @xmath188 at @xmath184 . for @xmath189",
    "the generalized kruppa equation implies that @xmath190 vanishes identically on @xmath180 , so its derivative must also vanish .",
    "this yields @xmath191 we shall prove that @xmath192 is in the linear span of @xmath178 and @xmath67 .",
    "( this means that when the epipole moves slightly , @xmath178 moves along the epipolar line . )",

    "since @xmath202 ( @xmath178 is not a singular point of the curve ) , this shows that @xmath203 , @xmath178 , and @xmath67 are linearly dependent . @xmath178 and @xmath67 are linearly independent , so @xmath192 must be in their linear span .",
    "we have that @xmath204 , so @xmath205 : the third term of equation ( [ eqnablaqfq ] ) vanishes . in a similar way , the first term of equation ( [ eqnablaqfq ] )",
    "vanishes , leaving @xmath206    the derivative of @xmath207 must also vanish , which yields @xmath208    from equality ( [ q_al ] ) , we deduce that for every @xmath209 , we have @xmath210 from equality ( [ e_12 ] ) , we deduce that every point @xmath211 lying on the baseline must satisfy @xmath212 the fact that @xmath185 is not a multiple of @xmath213 implies that @xmath214 , so together these two last equations mean that the union @xmath215 lies on a quadric surface .",
    "thus if there is no such quadric surface , every point in @xmath148 must be isolated .",
    "observe that this result is consistent with the previous proposition , since there always exist a quadric surface containing a given line and six given points .",
    "however in general there is no quadric containing a given line and seven given points .",
    "therefore we can conclude with the following theorem .    for a generic position of the centers of projection , the generalized kruppa equation defines the epipolar geometry up to a finite - fold ambiguity if and only if @xmath216 .",
    "since different curves in generic position give rise to independent equations , this result means that the sum of the classes of the projected curves must be at least @xmath217 for @xmath148 to be a finite set .",
