    "thus for the first time unambiguous evidence was obtained for hadrons with an additional quark - antiquark pair .",
    "analysis of the diana data demonstrates that the width of the @xmath0 is very small @xmath8 mev  @xcite .",
    "a similar small width was obtained from the analysis of the @xmath9 cross section  @xcite  @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "such a narrow width is extremely unusual for hadronic decays and requires reassessment of our understanding of quark dynamics .",
    "properties of the @xmath0 were in the excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions  @xcite based on the chiral quark soliton model .",
    "this paper motivated both experimental searches although later on the accuracy of these predictions was questioned  @xcite . in the quark soliton model",

    "[ antidecuplet ] ) .",
    "octet , decuplet , 27-plet , and 35-plet of pentaquarks are also expected .",
    "( 550,150 ) ( 40,-10 )    many experiments promptly confirmed the existence of the @xmath0  @xcite  @xmath10  @xcite in different processes : photoproduction , deep inelastic scattering , hadroproduction , and neutrino interactions .",
    "table  [ positive ] shows properties of the observed peaks .",
    "there is some spread in the mass values obtained by different experiments . in particular masses in the @xmath11",
    "final state are lower than in the @xmath1 one .",
    "the accuracy of the mass determination is not high in most of the experiments and therefore the disagreement is not very serious statistically .",
    "however the diana and zeus measurements are quite precise and contradict each other by more than 4 sigma .",
    "several experiments observe finite width of the @xmath0 that is much larger than 1 mev .",
    "however , the accuracy is again not high and within 3 sigma all width measurements are consistent with the instrumental resolution .    0.1 in    ._experiments with evidence for the @xmath0 baryon . _ [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ negative ]    the first significant negative result was published by the hera - b collaboration  @xcite .",
    "hera - b does not see any evidence for the @xmath0 but observes a clear @xmath5 and @xmath12(1520 ) signals of about 2 thousand events .",

    "reported @xmath0 masses from @xmath15 mev to @xmath16 mev the limit varies up to 16% .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath5 production cross sections @xmath17 is often used for the comparison of different experiments since @xmath5 is narrow and easily reconstructed , it has a mass similar to the @xmath0 mass and one can draw similar diagrams for @xmath5 and @xmath0 production by exchanging an @xmath18 meson into a @xmath19 meson . the existence of similar diagrams unfortunately does not prove that production mechanisms for @xmath0 and @xmath5 are similar .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 is of the order of unity in several experiments which observe the @xmath0 and less than a few percent in many experiments which do not see @xmath0 ( see table  [ negative ] ) .    in order to resolve this discrepancy",
    "many authors assume that the @xmath0 production drops very fast with energy and is heavily suppressed in @xmath20 annihilation .",
    "a model exists in which the @xmath0 production cross section is strongly suppressed at high energies in the fragmentation region  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how reliable this model is . in any case",
    "it is not applicable for the central production for example in the hera - b experiment where some models predict the @xmath0 yield much higher than the experimental limits  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0 production mechanism is not known and therefore it is important to have a high statistics experiment at low energies where most evidence for pentaquarks comes from .",
    "this goal was achieved by the belle collaboration which analyzed interactions of low momentum particles produced in @xmath20 interactions with the detector material .",
    "we will discuss this experiment after reviewing the situation with the anti - charmed and doubly strange pentaquarks .",
    "the anti - charmed pentaquark was observed in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 channels by the h1 collaboration both in dis and photo production  @xcite . after many experimental checks",
    "h1 concludes that the signal is real and self consistent .",
    "still the signal has very unusual properties .",
    "the @xmath23 measured width of @xmath24 mev is consistent with the experimental resolution of @xmath25 mev .",
    "so its intrinsic width is very small although its mass is @xmath26 mev above the @xmath21 threshold and @xmath27 mev above @xmath28 threshold .",
    "its decay into @xmath21 is clearly visible although naively one would expect much larger branching fraction for the @xmath29 channel where energy release is twice larger .",
    "finally it is produced with an enormous cross section . about 1.5% of all charged d * mesons are coming from decays of this new particle !",
    "these properties are very surprising but we can not a priory exclude such a possibility .    however , the zeus experiment which works at the same electron - proton collider hera does not see @xmath23 and gives an upper limit of 0.23% at the 95% cl on the fraction of charged @xmath30 coming from @xmath23 decays  @xcite .",
    "we denote this fraction @xmath31 . for dis events with @xmath32 gev@xmath33",
    "the upper limit is 0.35% at the 95% cl .",
    "this is a clear contradiction with the h1 result .",
    "we are not aware of any convincing explanation of this discrepancy .",
    "one can try to explain the difference using following arguments .",
    "zeus detects more soft @xmath30 than h1 .",
    "if one assumes that pentaquarks are produced with high momenta only , than @xmath30 mesons from their decays should be also energetic . in this case",
    "soft @xmath30 that are more efficiently detected by zeus should not be used in the comparison with h1 .",
    "however such an assumption does not resolve the discrepancy since zeus does not see the signal also in the kinematic range very similar to the h1 one .    the cdf collaboration also does not see any sign of @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "cdf has two orders of magnitude more reconstructed @xmath30 mesons .",
    "they reconstruct @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 decays which have the event topology very similar to @xmath23 .",
    "majority of charm particles at hera and tevatron are produced in the fragmentation process .",
    "it is impossible to reconcile the results of the two experiments if @xmath23 is produced in the fragmentation process as well .",
    "no other mechanism was proposed so far .",
    "there are also upper limits on @xmath23 production in @xmath20 collisions by aleph  @xcite and in photo production by focus  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the evidence for @xmath23 is by far weaker than the evidence against it .",
    "the na49 claim for the observation of the doubly strange pentaquark was not supported by several experiments which tried to find it .",
    "hera - b has 8 times more @xmath38 hyperons and slightly better mass resolution .",
    "there is no @xmath39 signal in the @xmath40 or @xmath41 mass distributions ( see fig .",
    "[ hera - b ] ) while there is a clear @xmath42 peak with about 1000 events ( including charge conjugate combinations ) .",
    "hera - b sets an upper limit of 4%/@xmath43 at the 95%cl on the ratio of production cross section for @xmath44 and @xmath42 .",

    "however the arguments about a very fast drop of the pentaquark production cross section in the fragmentation region  @xcite do not apply to the central production where the signal is observed by na49  @xcite and where it is searched for at hera - b .",

    "however this experiment uses a @xmath50 beam and a straightforward comparison is not possible .",
    "the aleph , babar , cdf , compass , focus and zeus experiments also do not see @xmath51 in a variety of initial processes  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the evidence for @xmath51 is by far weaker than the evidence against it .",

    "it was argued , however , that the @xmath0 production can be suppressed at high energies or in specific processes like @xmath20 annihilation .",
    "therefore belle decided to study interactions of low momentum particles produced in @xmath20 interactions with the detector material .",
    "this allows to achieve production conditions similar to the experiments which observe the @xmath0 .",

    "a comparison of the belle upper limit on @xmath17 with the exclusive photoproduction experiments is not simple .",
    "however , it is very strange to have about two orders of magnitude difference in @xmath17 since the belle kaon ( and pion ) momentum spectrum is quite soft and comparable with the momentum spectrum of virtual kaons ( or pions ) in the low energy photoproduction experiments .",
    "the na49 claim for the observation of @xmath39 pentaquarks is hard to reconcile with the results of many experiments which have up to 300 times larger statistics of usual @xmath38 and @xmath72 hyperons and a better mass resolution . in particular e690",
    "investigated the same production process at about twice larger cm energy and obtained hundred times lower limit on the ratio of @xmath39 and @xmath72 production cross sections .",

    "three other experiments do not see any sign of the @xmath23 in different production processes  @xcite .",
    "it is hard to reconcile the h1 claim with this overwhelming negative evidence .",
    "the claims for observation of the @xmath0 in inclusive production at medium and high energies are not supported by many high statistics experiments which reconstruct by far larger number of ordinary hyperons with negative strangeness . even if one assumes that the @xmath0 production is strongly suppressed at high energies there is still a contradiction between several of these results with the belle upper limit obtained with low momentum kaons .",
    "however , even if some claims for the @xmath0 observation are wrong it does not mean that all observations are wrong .",
