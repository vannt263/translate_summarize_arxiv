    "after a physical system has passed rapidly through a continuous phase - transition , its order - parameter can have components with large differences between adjacent , but causally disconnected , `` domains '' .",
    "in such systems topological defects can form at the domain boundaries@xcite .",
    "this idea was proposed by kibble @xcite in connection with the grand unified theory ( gut ) symmetry - breaking phase - transition of the early universe , and has been developed by zurek @xcite who has estimated how the density of defects created depends on the rate at which the system passes through the transition .",
    "zurek also pointed out that this mechanism of defect production was applicable , in principle , to all continuous phase - transitions , and that it should therefore be possible to validate some aspects of cosmological theories through laboratory - scale experiments .",
    "the first of these examined weakly first - order phase - transitions in liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "later , the corresponding experiments were carried out using the second - order superfluid phase - transitions of liquid @xmath6he  @xcite and liquid @xmath7he @xcite .",
    "all these experiments produced defect densities reported as being consistent with zurek s estimates@xcite .",
    "in this paper we describe an improved version of the @xmath6he experiment @xcite in which particular care has been taken to minimise the production of topological defects ( _ i.e. _ quantised vortices ) by ordinary hydrodynamic flow processes .",
    "our new results , of which a preliminary report@xcite has already been published , show no convincing evidence of _ any _ vortex creation at all .",
    "but they allow us to place an approximate upper - bound on the initial density of vortices produced by the kibble - zurek mechanism .",
    "a considerable amount is known about the properties@xcite of vortices , and about how they are created at very low temperatures@xcite but the mechanism responsible for the vorticity that appears@xcite as a result of passing through the @xmath8-transition ( which separates the normal and the superfluid phases ) is not understood .",
    "one possibility is that pre - existing rotational flow caused by e.g.  convection or boiling in the phase is , with the onset of long - range order , converted into quantised vortex lines in ; this is quite distinct from the zurek scenario which we shall now briefly describe .",
    "the underlying idea @xcite is quite simple .",
    "a small isolated volume of is initially held at pressure @xmath9 , and temperature @xmath10 , just above the temperature @xmath11 of the @xmath8-transition .",
    "the logarithmic infinity in its heat capacity at @xmath12 makes it impossible to _ cool _ the sample quickly into the superfluid phase but the pressure dependence of @xmath12 means that it can be taken through the transition very rapidly by adiabatic _ expansion _ into the phase , to a final pressure @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 ( fig  [ trajectories ] ) .",
    "fluctuations present in the are expected to cause the nascent superfluid to form with a spatially incoherent order - parameter , corresponding to a large density of vortex lines .",
    "this scenario depends on the fact that the liquid can , in principle , expand at velocities comparable to that of first - sound , whereas the propagation velocity for changes in the order - parameter is limited by the much slower velocity of second - sound .",
    "the analogy @xcite between liquid helium and the early universe arises because they both be considered to undergo second - order phase transitions describable in terms of ginsburg - landau theory @xcite . in each case",
    "the potential contribution to the free - energy density can be written as :    @xmath15    where the parameter @xmath16 is positive at temperatures above @xmath12 and negative below it , and @xmath17 is a constant . for liquid",
    "@xmath6he the order - parameter is the modulus of the complex - scalar field @xmath18 , _ i.e. _ the bose condensate wave - function which is a solution of the ginsburg - pitaevskii equation @xcite . in the cosmological analogy",
    "the components of @xmath18 are higgs fields @xcite . in the symmetric ( ) phase @xmath19 and the time - average of the order - parameter @xmath20 . below @xmath12",
    "this gauge symmetry , is broken so @xmath21 becomes non - zero , and the real and imaginary parts of the potential in equation  1 acquire the same `` sombrero '' shape as the corresponding cosmological free energy expressed in terms of higgs fields ( fig .",
    "[ sombrero ] ) . in the early universe",
    "a symmetry - breaking phase - transition from a false - vacuum state to a true - vacuum state is thought to have occurred once the temperature had fallen to @xmath22 , about @xmath23 after the big bang .",
    "although there are many variants of the basic model , with and without inflation , it is believed that a variety of topological defects @xcite would have been produced in the transition because an event horizon prevented adjacent regions from being causally connected .",
    "cosmic strings @xcite  thin tubes of false vacuum  are one such defect and may have had a role in galaxy formation .",
    "it is these that correspond to the quantised vortices found in .",
    "the analogy between the helium and cosmological phase transitions may thus be summarised as follows ",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]",
    "in our initial experiments @xcite , the vortex density was measured by recording the attenuation of a sequence of second - sound pulses propagated through the .",
    "we expected that , following an expansion , the pulse amplitude would grow towards its vortex - free value as the tangle decayed and the attenuation decreased .",
    "a considerable amount is known about the decay @xcite of hydrodynamically created vortex tangles in .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite give a good qualitative description of the manner in which a homogeneous isotropic tangle evolves and decays .",
    "the rate at which it occurs in this temperature range is governed by the vinen @xcite equation    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the vortex - line density at time @xmath26 , the @xmath6he atomic mass is @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the relationship between vortex density and second - sound attenuation is known @xcite from experiments with rotating helium , and may for present purposes be written    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the velocity of second - sound , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the signal amplitudes with and without vortices present respectively .",
    "@xmath33 is a weakly temperature dependent parameter , @xmath34 is the quantum of circulation , and @xmath35 is the transducer separation .",
    "integrating equation  [ eqnvinen ] and substituting for @xmath25 from equation  [ eqnl ] gives an expression for the recovery of the signal :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the vortex density immediately after the expansion .",
    "all the constants in this expression are known , although @xmath28 and @xmath33 do not seem to have been measured accurately within the temperature range of interest .",
    "a description of our first attempt to realise a bulk version @xcite of zurek s experiment has been given in a previous paper @xcite but , briefly , the arrangement was as follows .",
    "a cell with phosphor - bronze concertina walls was filled , by condensing in isotopically@xcite pure @xmath6he through a capillary tube , and then sealed with a needle - valve ( fig .",
    "[ original ] ) .",
    "the top of the cell was fixed rigidly to the cryostat but its bottom surface could be moved to compress the liquid , or released to expand it , using a pull - rod from the top of the cryostat .",
    "the cell was _ in vacuo _ surrounded by a reservoir of liquid @xmath6he at @xmath38 .",
    "a straty - adams capacitance gauge @xcite recorded the pressure in the cell and carbon - resistors were used as thermometers , one in the reservoir , one on the cell .",
    "the temperature of the cell could be adjusted by means of an electrical heater and a breakable thermal link to the @xmath39 reservoir . a trigger mechanism on the mechanical linkage allowed the cell to increase its volume by @xmath40 very rapidly under the influence of its own internal pressure .",
    "as described above , the vortex density was inferred from the amplitude of second - sound pulses created with a thin - film heater .",
    "the signal was detected with a bolometer and passed , _ via _ a cryogenic fet preamplifier , to a nicolet 1280 data processor which recorded some @xmath41 pulses during 12 s following the expansion .",
    "the last pulses in the sequence define @xmath32 , the signal amplitude in the ( virtual ) absence of vortices @xcite .",
    "[ recovery ] shows examples of data recorded with this first version of the experiment .",
    "there was a `` dead period '' of about @xmath42 after the mechanical shock of the expansion which caused vibrations that obscured the signals .",
    "the initial vortex - density was therefore obtained from plots such as fig .",
    "[ recovery](a ) by back - extrapolation to the moment @xmath43 of traversing the transition and was found to be @xmath44 consistent with the theoretical expectation @xcite . however , an unexpected observation in these initial experiments @xcite was that small densities of vortices were created even for expansions that occurred wholly in the superfluid phase ( fig .",
    "[ recovery]c ) , provided that the starting point was very close to @xmath12 .",
    "the phenomenon was initially @xcite attributed to vortices produced in thermal fluctuations within the critical regime , but it was pointed out @xcite that effects of this kind are only to be expected for expansions starting within a few microkelvin of the transition , _",
    "i.e. _ much closer than the typical experimental value of a few millikelvin .",
    "the most plausible interpretation  that the vortices in question were of conventional hydrodynamic origin , arising from non - idealities in the design of the expansion chamber  was disturbing , because expansions starting above @xmath12 traverse the same region .",
    "thus some , at least , of the vortices seen in expansions through the transition were probably not attributable to the zurek - kibble mechanism as had been assumed .",
    "it has been of particular importance , therefore , to undertake a new experiment with as many as possible of the non - idealities in the original design eliminated or minimised .",
    "an ideal experiment would avoid all fluid flow parallel to surfaces during the expansion .",
    "this could , in principle , be accomplished by the radial expansion of a spherical volume , or the axial expansion of a cylinder with stretchy walls . in neither of these cases",
    "would there be any relative motion of fluid and walls in the direction parallel to the walls , and hence no hydrodynamic production of vortices .",
    "however , it is impossible to eliminate the effects of fluid - flow completely from any real apparatus . at the @xmath8-transition the critical velocity tends to zero , so _",
    "any _ finite flow - velocity will create vorticity",
    ". however , the period during which this happens is very short ; the entire expansion takes only a few milliseconds so only limited growth can occur from the surface - vorticity sheet of half - vortex - rings @xcite .",
    "with hindsight , we can identify the principal causes of unintended vortex creation in the original experiment@xcite , in order of importance , as follows : ( a ) expansion of liquid into the cell from the filling capillary , which was closed by a needle valve @xmath45 up - stream ; ( b ) expansion of liquid out of a shorter capillary connecting the cell to the straty - adams capacitive pressure - gauge ; ( c ) flow out of and past the fixed yoke ( a u - shaped structure ) on which the second - sound transducers were mounted .",
    "in addition , ( d ) there were the undesirable transients caused by the expansion system bouncing against the mechanical stop at room temperature .",
    "the walls of the cell were made from bronze bellows @xcite , rather than being a stretchy cylinder , but the effects of the flow parallel to the convoluted surfaces were relatively small .",
    "the design of our new expansion cell ( fig .  [ redesigned ] ) addressed all the listed problems , as follows : ( a ) a hydraulically - operated needle - valve eliminated the dead - volume of capillary tube ; ( b ) the phosphor - bronze diaphragm of the pressure gauge @xcite became an integral part of the upper cell - wall eliminating the long tube leading to the pressure gauge ; ( c ) the cell was shortened from @xmath46 to @xmath47 so that the heater - bolometer pair could be mounted flush with its top and bottom inner surfaces , thereby eliminating any need for a yoke ; ( d ) some damping of the expansion was provided by the addition of a ( light motor - vehicle ) hydraulic shock - absorber .    the operation of the apparatus , the technique of data collection and the analysis were much as described previously @xcite except that the rate at which the sample passed through the @xmath8-transition was determined directly by simultaneous measurements of the position @xcite of the pull - rod ( giving the volume of the cell , and hence its pressure ) and the temperature of the cell .",
    "the position detector made use of the variation of inductance of a solenoid coil when a ferrite - core is moved in and out .",
    "the 1 cm long , 4 mm diameter , ferrite - core was rigidly attached to the top of the pull - rod , where it emerged from the cryostat , and was positioned so that half of it was inside the 5 mm bore of the solenoid .",
    "the solenoid itself was clamped to the cryostat top - plate so that , as the cell expanded and the pull - rod moved down , the ferrite penetrated further inside .",
    "the position was measured by making the solenoid part of a resonant lcr circuit and setting the frequency so that the output was at half maximum .",
    "the 2 mhz ac signal was rectified , smoothed and then measured using a digital oscilloscope .",
    "the response time , which was limited by the smoothing and the @xmath48 of the circuit , was @xmath49s and the sensitivity was @xmath50500 mv / mm .",
    "this , and the linearity of the system , were measured by calibration against a micrometer .",
    "the position could in principle be measured to an accuracy of @xmath51 m but in the experiment this became @xmath52 m because of the 8 bit digitiser of the oscilloscope .",
    "we define the dimensionless distance from the transition by @xmath53 and the quench time @xmath54 by @xmath55    fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows a typical evolution of @xmath56 with time during an expansion . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , which plots the full expansion period , it is evident that the system `` bounces '' momentarily near @xmath57 , but without passing back through the transition .",
    "the effect is believed to be associated with the onset of damping from the shock absorber , after backlash in the system has been taken up .",
    "the quench time is readily determined from @xmath58 near the transition . in the case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , shown in expanded form in part ( b ) , it was @xmath59 .",
    "we are thus able take both the pressure - dependence of @xmath12 , and the non - constant rate of expansion , explicitly into account .",
    "the improvements in the cell - design intended to eliminate vortices originating from conventional fluid - flow were clearly successful ; as we had hoped , and unlike the first cell , expansion trajectories that stay within the superfluid phase , even those starting as close as @xmath60 to the transition , create no detectable vorticity ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we were surprised , however , to discover that no detectable vorticity was created even when the expansion trajectory passed through the transition .",
    "signal amplitudes measured just after two such expansions are shown by the data points of fig .",
    "it is immediately evident that , unlike the results obtained from the original cell @xcite , there is now no evidence of any systematic growth of the signal amplitude with time or , correspondingly , for the creation of any vortices at the transition .",
    "one possible reason is that the density of vortices created is smaller than the theoretical estimates @xcite , but we must also consider the possibility that they are decaying faster than they can be measured .",
    "to try to clarify matters , we performed a subsidiary set of experiments , deliberately creating vortices by conventional means and then following their decay by measurements of the recovery of the second - sound signal amplitude . by leaving the needle - valve open , so that @xmath61 of liquid from the dead volume outside the needle - valve actuator - bellows squirted into the cell during an expansion",
    ", we could create large densities of vorticity and observe their decay . despite the highly non - equilibrium situation that arises immediately following the expansion , as liquid squirts into the cell",
    ", it was found that the temperature reached a steady value after @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows two examples of attenuation plots ( @xmath63^{-1}$ ] against time @xmath26 ) and these always , within the experimental errors , had the linear form predicted by equation  [ eqnline ] .",
    "[ fig10 ] summarises the results of a number of expansions from which it was possible to determine @xmath64 as a function of temperature and pressure .",
    "we found that @xmath64 was weakly temperature - dependent and over the range of interest , @xmath65 it could be approximated by @xmath66 .",
    "this measured value of @xmath64 was then used to calculate the evolution of @xmath67 with time for different values of @xmath37 , assuming @xmath68 , yielding the curves shown in fig .",
    "8 . from the @xmath54",
    "derived from the gradient in fig  [ fig6 ] , and zurek s estimate ( based on renormalisation - group theory ) of @xmath69 we are thus led to expect that @xmath70 .",
    "direct comparison of the calculated curves and measured data in fig .  [ fig11 ] shows that this is plainly not the case .",
    "in fact , the data suggest that @xmath37 , the vorticity created by the transition , is no more than @xmath71 , smaller than the expected value by at least two orders - of - magnitude .",
    "given the apparently positive outcome of the earlier investigations@xcite , the null result of the present experiment has come as something of a surprise .",
    "there are several points to be made .",
    "first , zurek did not expect his estimates of @xmath37 be accurate to better than one , or possibly two , orders - of - magnitude , and his more recent estimate @xcite suggests somewhat lower defect - densities .",
    "so it remains possible that his picture @xcite is correct for @xmath6he in all essential details , and that an improved experiment with faster expansions now being planned will reveal evidence of the kibble - zurek mechanism at work in liquid @xmath6he .",
    "secondly , it must be borne in mind that ( [ eqnvinen ] ) , and the value of @xmath72 measured ( from plots like those in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) from the data of fig.[fig9 ] , refer to hydrodynamically generated vortex lines .",
    "vorticity generated in the nonequilibrium phase transition might perhaps be significantly different , e.g.  in respect of its loop - size distribution @xcite .",
    "it could therefore decay faster , and might consequently be unobservable in the present experiments .",
    "thirdly , it is surprising to us that the @xmath7he experiments @xcite seem to agree with zurek s original estimates @xcite whereas the present experiment shows that they overstate @xmath37 by _ at least _ two orders - of - magnitude .",
    "it is not yet known for sure why this should be , although an interesting explanation of the apparent discrepancy has recently been suggested @xcite by karra and rivers .",
    "they suggest that fluctuations near to @xmath73 may change the winding number , i.e.  reduce the density of vortices produced in the @xmath6he experiment , and they show that the analogous density reduction would be much smaller in the case of the @xmath7he experiments .",
