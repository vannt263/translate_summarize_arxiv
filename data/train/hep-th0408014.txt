    "recently , in context of ads / cft , energies of semiclassical string states on @xmath5 have successfully compared with anomalous dimensions of operators in planar @xmath6 super yang - mills theory . in @xcite , it was shown that energy of semiclassical string states with large angular momentum in @xmath7 agrees qualitatively with anomalous dimension of twist two operators of @xmath6 sym .",

    "then , some kind of semiclassical string states with several large angular momentums in @xmath8 ( and @xmath7 ) have been found to have energies which have analytic expansion in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 :  t hooft coupling , @xmath11 : angular momentum)@xcite .    on the other hand ,",

    ", we does not decompose the @xmath124 matrix to @xmath125 matrix .",

    "we need not to specify which gauge group each field belongs to . more carefully , in order to take account of all gauge invariant operators we have to introduce the ` twisted sectors ' of the operators , @xmath127 where @xmath128 we call these operators twisted operators . on the other hand , the operators of correspond to @xmath129 and we call these untwisted operators .    the operators with different twist number @xmath130 are not mixed in 2-point function .",

    "if otherwise , diagonal parts of the operators are zero matrices and the operators vanish by the trace . this fact can be seen as following .",
    "@xmath141 so , the invariant condition is automatically satisfied in field theory side .",

    "we explain this fact in appendix .",
    "this agreement could also be explained by ` inherited principle ' of @xcite .",

    "the anomalous dimension matrix is not the same as that of untwisted sector .",
    "nevertheless , we can resolve this subtlety and we find that the spin chain systems corresponding to these twisted sectors of operators are also solvable",

    "the phase shift for twisted sector mentioned above does not happen in this case ( see fig .",

    "this takes the form of a hamiltonian of the @xmath167 heisenberg spin chain .",
    "the boundary condition is periodic now .",
    "this model is solvable by bethe ansatz .",

    "especially , we can see from this result that the twisted sectors of the strings are dual to the twisted sectors of the operators .",
    "next , we consider spin chains corresponding to @xmath3 symmetries broken by orbifolding .",
    "one of examples is the @xmath26 sector , which consists of the following operators , @xmath184 @xmath66 and @xmath67 fields form a doublet of @xmath26 symmetry , which is broken by orbifolding .",

    "@xmath66 field is a @xmath190-type operator but @xmath67 field is a @xmath191-type operator .",
    "hence the sequence of the gauge groups in the trace of the operator is not one - way but zigzag .",
    "this causes the phase shifts of interactions between the @xmath146-th site and the first ( @xmath147-th ) site .",

    "the virasoro constraint imposes @xmath318 where we use . remembering @xmath319 , the equations , and are equivalent to the equations , and .",
    "in this paper , we have shown the agreements , at one - loop level of field theory , between the energies of the semiclassical strings in @xmath320 and the anomalous dimensions of the long length operators of @xmath1 planar orbifold field theories originating from @xmath6 sym .",
    "on the gauge theory side , we have found that the orbifold field theories have the integrabilities in @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors even when these symmetries are broken by the orbifold action .",
    "for an untwisted sector of operators , a corresponding spin chain is a @xmath3(@xmath4 ) xxx spin chain with periodic boundary condition . for twisted sectors of operators , if this @xmath3(@xmath4 ) is global symmetry of the orbifold theory , corresponding spin chain models are also xxx spin chains with periodic boundary condition . on the other hand , in the case of the broken symmetry ,",
    "spin chains corresponding to twisted sectors of operators become xxx spin chains with twisted boundary condition .",
    "these facts suggest that @xmath13 super spin chains with twisted boundary condition correspond to anomalous dimension matrices of full - sector operators in orbifold theories",
    ". this may be the case even for the non - supersymmetric orbifold field theories .    with the spin chains corresponding to the orbifold theories in hand , we compared the 2-spin circular string solutions of the strings in @xmath0 to the rational solutions of the @xmath3 xxx spin chain .",
    "we saw the agreement between the energies of the strings and the anomalous dimensions of the operators at one - loop level .",
    "especially , the strings in the twisted sectors correspond to the ` twisted sectors ' of the operators .",
    "furthermore , we have generalized the agreements between the sigma models of string and gauge sides to the orbifold cases .",
    "this is done for @xmath3 sectors and @xmath4 sectors .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss higher loops .",
    "also at higher loops , the phase shifts born at interactions which step @xmath148 are cancelled by the same twisted boundary condition as at one - loop level .",
    "then , corresponding spin chain is the same as that in @xmath6 case@xcite except for twisted boundary condition .",
    "hence , the agreements of string energies and anomalous dimensions would hold in higher loop level , if these hold in @xmath6 case .",
    "it is known that this agreement survive at 2-loop level , but there are discrepancy at 3-loop level in @xmath6 case@xcite .",
    "so , this would be the case for orbifold cases we consider",
    ".    it would be interesting to expand our results to more broaden class of operators , say full - sector of operators .",
    "the author would like to thank y.  imamura and t.  kawano for helpful comments and reading the manuscript and y.  matsuo for useful advice and encouragement .",
    "we consider untwisted operators consisting of @xmath66 , @xmath67 fields in @xmath30 case . these are @xmath124 matrix valued fields .",
    "the operators we consider have the form of @xmath321 , etc . arguments in this section can be applied also to @xmath3(@xmath4 ) subsectors of sec .  3(sec .",
    "there are three types of diagrams fig.[zdia ] which contribute to renormalization @xmath24-factor .",
    "vertices of orbifold theory are inherited from @xmath6 @xmath103 sym .",
    "hence , there is one to one correspondence between diagrams of orbifold theory and diagrams of @xmath6 sym .",
    "furthermore , contribution of each diagram to @xmath24-factor in orbifold theory agrees with that in @xmath6 @xmath322 sym .",
    "let us explain the last statement .",
    "it is convenient to see diagrams in terms of component fields , which is @xmath112 matrix valued ( @xmath323 etc ) .",
    "for instance , in a diagram consisting of @xmath124 matrix valued fields @xmath66 , @xmath324 and @xmath325 of the orbifold theory ( fig.[yukawa](a ) ) , there is only one diagram which is concerned with a field @xmath326 ( fig.[yukawa](b ) ) . in fig.[yukawa](b ) , fields which run a loop are bifundamental fermions which are @xmath112 matrices .",
    "let us compare the diagram fig.[yukawa](b ) with a diagram of @xmath6 @xmath322 sym ( fig.[yukawa](c ) ) . in fig.[yukawa](c ) , fields which run a loop are adjoint fermions which are @xmath112 matrices and then , the value of this diagram is the same as that of the diagram of fig.[yukawa](b ) .",
    "this fact is true for each @xmath112 valued component fields . since the diagram fig.[yukawa](a ) is merely linear summation of the diagram fig.[yukawa](b ) for each component field , a contribution of fig.[yukawa](a ) to @xmath24-factor in orbifold theory is the same as that of fig.[yukawa](c ) to @xmath24-factor in @xmath14 @xmath322 sym .",
    "this fact is approved for other diagrams in fig.[zdia ] .",
    "therefore a form of anomalous dimension matrix of untwisted operators in orbifold theory is the same as that of @xmath6 @xmath322 sym .",
    "here , we outline how to solve bethe equations and translation condition in large @xmath146 limit and obtain anomalous dimension using the solutions .",
    "we use a method which are described in appendix of @xcite . for details",
    ", we would like to refer to the original paper .",
    "the equations we consider are @xmath327 where @xmath328 and @xmath178 are not necessarily integers .",
    "let us define the resolvent @xmath329 the total momentum and total energy , which is proportional to anomalous dimension of spin chain are described in terms of the resolvent @xmath330 multiplying by @xmath331 and summing over @xmath115 and using appropriately , we obtain @xmath332 where we drop a term of subleading in @xmath333 expansion .",
    "this is quadratic equation of @xmath334 and solution is @xmath335 this @xmath334 goes to @xmath336 in @xmath337 .",
    "this value should be equal to @xmath338 .",
    "hence , @xmath339 is imposed .",
    "so , @xmath328 must have the same sign as @xmath178 .",
    "furthermore , bethe ansatz assume @xmath340 , so this imposes @xmath341 . from these facts",
    ", @xmath342 has the same sign as @xmath328 and @xmath178 .",
