    "recently studies of qcd thermodynamics on the lattice have successfully been extended to non - vanishing quark ( or baryon ) chemical potential using taylor expansions @xcite as well as reweighting techniques @xcite around the limit of vanishing quark chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) and analytic continuations of numerical calculations performed with an imaginary chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the complementary approach at fixed baryon number @xcite has also been used recently in simulations of 4-flavor qcd with light quarks @xcite .",
    "these calculations yield the additional contribution to the pressure that arises from the presence of a net excess of baryons over anti - baryons in a strongly interacting medium .",
    "we will further explore here the approach based on a taylor expansion of the pressure and make use of our earlier calculations for 2-flavor qcd @xcite to determine also the energy and entropy densities at non - vanishing baryon chemical potential .    in a heavy ion collision a dense medium",
    "is created which after thermalization is expected to expand without further generation of entropy ( @xmath7 ) and with fixed baryon number ( @xmath8 ) or , equivalently , with fixed quark number @xmath9 . during the isentropic expansion the ratio @xmath2 thus remains constant",
    "denotes the net baryon number , i.e. the excess of baryons over anti - baryons . ] .",
    "the cooling of the expanding system then is controlled by the equation of state on lines of constant @xmath2 . from a knowledge of the energy density and pressure at non - vanishing quark chemical potential we can calculate trajectories in the @xmath10-@xmath11 phase diagram of qcd that correspond to constant @xmath2 and",
    "can determine the _ isentropic equation of state _ on these trajectories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the basic setup for calculating taylor expansions for bulk thermodynamic observables and present a calculation of the taylor expansion coefficients for energy and entropy densities at non - vanishing quark chemical potential up to @xmath0 .",
    "we use these results in section iii to determine lines of constant @xmath2 and study the temperature dependence of pressure and energy density along these lines .",
    "our conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "the analysis we are going to present in this paper is based on numerical results previously obtained in simulations of 2-flavor qcd on lattices of size @xmath12 with an improved staggered fermion action @xcite . in these calculations",
    "taylor expansion coefficients for the pressure have been obtained up to @xmath13 for a fixed bare quark mass value ( @xmath14 ) which at temperatures close to the transition temperature ( @xmath15 ) corresponds to a still quite large pion mass of about 770  mev . however , in particular at temperatures above the qcd transition temperature the remaining quark mass dependence of thermodynamic observables is nonetheless small as deviations from the massless limit are controlled by the quark mass in units of the temperature , which is a small number .",
    "we closely follow here the approach and notation used in ref .",
    "we start with a taylor expansion for the pressure in 2-flavor qcd for non - vanishing quark chemical potential @xmath10 ( and vanishing isospin chemical potential , @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 with @xmath18 here we explicitely indicated that the taylor expansion coefficients @xmath19 depend on temperature as well as the quark mass and the quark mass value used in our calculation finite volume effects are expected to be small . ] . in the context of lattice calculations it is more customary to think of this quark mass dependence in terms of a dependence on an appropriately chosen ratio of hadron masses characterizing _ lines of constant physics_. we",
    "thus may replace @xmath20 by a ratio of pseudo - scalar ( pion ) and vector ( rho ) meson masses , @xmath21 .",
    "due to the invariance of the partition function under exchange of particle and anti - particle the taylor expansion is a series in even powers of @xmath1 ; expansion coefficients @xmath19 vanish for odd values of @xmath22 . from the pressure",
    "we immediately obtain the quark number density , @xmath23 using standard thermodynamic relations we also can calculate the difference between energy density ( @xmath24 ) and three times the pressure , @xmath25 where @xmath26 combining eqs .  [ eq : p ] ,  [ eq : nq ] , and [ eq : e3p ]",
    "we then obtain taylor expansions for the energy and entropy densities , @xmath27 the expansion coefficients @xmath28 have been calculated in 2-flavor qcd at several values of the temperature and for a fixed value of the bare quark mass , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we note that the bare coupling @xmath29 introduces an implicit temperature dependence if @xmath29 is kept fixed while the lattice cut - off is varied .",
    "the latter controls the temperature of the system on lattices of temporal extent @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath31 .",
    "the difference between derivatives taken at fixed @xmath29 and fixed @xmath20 , however , is negligible at high temperature , where the quark mass dependence of bulk thermodynamic quantities is @xmath32 and , of course , vanishes at all temperatures in the chiral limit as this also defines a line of constant physics .",
    "we thus approximate the derivative , eq .  [ eq : cne3p ] , by a derivative taken at fixed @xmath29 which becomes exact in the chiral limit .",
    "these derivatives are evaluated using finite difference approximants .",
    "alternatively we may express derivatives of taylor expansion coefficients with respect to @xmath11 in terms of derivatives with respect to the bare lattice couplings @xmath33 and @xmath29 and rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : cne3p ] as , @xmath34 here the two lattice @xmath35-functions , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , have to be determined by demanding that the temperature derivative is taken along lines of constant physics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35-function controlling the variation of the bare quark mass with the lattice cut - off , @xmath37 , is proportional to the bare quark mass @xmath29 and thus vanishes in the chiral limit @xcite . for small quark",
    "masses the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : cne3pb ] thus gives the dominant contribution to @xmath38 .",
    "we have evaluated this first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : cne3pb ] for @xmath39 and find that this approximation for @xmath40 agrees within errors with the calculation of @xmath40 from finite difference approximants . only close to @xmath15 we find differences of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath28 have been calculated in @xcite for @xmath14 at a set of 16 temperature values in the interval @xmath42 $ ] . from this set of expansion coefficients",
    "we have calculated the partial derivatives @xmath43 at temperature @xmath11 by averaging over finite difference approximants for left and right derivatives at @xmath11 . with this",
    "we have constructed the expansion coefficients for the energy and entropy densities , @xmath44 results for the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 order expansion coefficients of energy and entropy densities obtained in the approximation discussed above are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : es ] . also shown in this figure",
    "are the corresponding expansion coefficients for the pressure ( @xmath48 ) . for temperatures larger than @xmath49",
    "all expansion coefficients satisfy quite well the ideal gas relations , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . as noted already in ref .",
    "@xcite results for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 order expansion coefficients are close to those of an ideal fermi gas which describes the high temperature limit for the energy density of 2-flavor qcd , @xmath52 nonetheless , quantitative statements on the approach to ideal gas behavior may be at present premature .",
    "deviations from the continuum result clearly arise in our current analysis which has been performed on lattices with a lattice spacing in units of the inverse temperature given by @xmath53 .",
    "although cut - off effects are reduced due the usage of an improved action the approach to the continuum limit has to be analyzed further through calculations on lattices with larger temporal extent @xmath30 .",
    "although errors on the @xmath47 order expansion coefficients are large it is apparent that subsequent orders in the expansion decrease in magnitude thus making the expansions for energy and entropy density well behaved for @xmath54 . in fact",
    ", the @xmath47 order contribution to @xmath55 and @xmath56 never exceeds 10% for @xmath57 .",
    "we will see below that this is the regime of interest for a discussion of the thermodynamics of matter formed in heavy ion collisions at the sps and rhic and even is appropriate for the energy range to be covered by the ags and the future fair facility at gsi / darmstadt .",
    "results for the @xmath10-dependent contribution to the energy and entropy densities , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , obtained in @xmath46 order taylor expansion are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermo ] for some values of @xmath1 .",
    "when discussing the equation of state at finite baryon number density we have to eliminate the quark chemical potential in the thermodynamic quantities introduced in the previous section .",
    "we may do this by demanding that a thermodynamic quantity , for instance the quark number density , stays constant .",
    "we will use here a prescription more appropriate for discussing the thermodynamics of matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "after equilibration the dense medium created in such a collision will expand along lines of constant entropy per baryon .",
    "it then is of interest to calculate thermodynamic quantities along such isentropic lines .",
    "we thus should first analyze how the quark chemical potential changes along lines of constant @xmath2 .",
    "it is readily seen that in an ideal quark - gluon gas these lines are defined by @xmath60  const , @xmath61 in the zero temperature limit , however , the resonance gas reduces to a degenerate fermi gas of nucleons and the chemical potential approaches a finite value to obtain finite baryon number and entropy , _ i.e. _ @xmath62 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] we show the values for @xmath10 needed to keep @xmath2 fixed .",
    "these lines of constant @xmath2 in the @xmath11-@xmath10 plane have been obtained by calculating the total entropy density for 2-flavor qcd from eq .",
    "[ eq : es ] using results for the pressure and energy density calculated at @xmath6 @xcite and the corresponding @xmath10 dependent contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : es ] .",
    "the ratio of @xmath56 and @xmath63 obtained in this way is then solved numerically for @xmath1 .",
    "we find that isentropic expansion at high temperature indeed is well represented by lines of constant @xmath1 down to temperatures close to the transition , @xmath64 . in the low temperature regime",
    "we observe a bending of the isentropic lines in accordance with the expected asymptotic low temperature behavior .",
    "the isentropic expansion lines for matter created at sps correspond to @xmath65 while the isentropes at rhic correspond to @xmath66 .",
    "the energy range of the ags which also corresponds to an energy range relevant for future experiments at fair / darmstadt is well described by @xmath67 .",
    "these lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso](right ) together with points characterizing the chemical freeze - out of hadrons measured at ags , sps and rhic energies .",
    "these points have been obtained by comparing experimental results for yields of various hadron species with hadron abundances in a resonance gas @xcite .",
    "the solid curve shows a phenomenological parametrization of these _ freeze - out data _ @xcite . in general our findings for lines of constant @xmath2 are in good agreement with phenomenological model calculations that are based on combinations of ideal gas and resonance gas equations of state at high and low temperature , respectively @xcite .",
    "our current analysis yields stable results for lines of constant @xmath2 also for temperatures @xmath68 and values of the chemical potential @xmath69  mev .",
    "this value of @xmath70 is larger than recent estimates for the location of the chiral critical point in 2-flavor @xcite and ( 2 + 1)-flavor @xcite qcd .",
    "we thus may expect modifications to our current analysis at temperatures below @xmath15 once we include higher orders in the taylor expansion and/or perform this analysis at smaller values of the quark mass .",
    "we now can proceed and calculate energy density and pressure on lines of constant entropy per baryon number using our taylor expansion results up to @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] we show both quantities for the parameters relevant for ags ( fair ) , sps and rhic energies . at high temperatures",
    "the relevant values of the quark chemical potential in an ideal quark gas are @xmath71 , 0.54 and 0.08 , respectively . however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] at temperatures @xmath72 the required values for the chemical potentials are significantly smaller .",
    "in particular , for the ags ( fair ) energies ( @xmath73 ) we find @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath47 order taylor expansion thus is still well behaved at these values of the quark chemical potential .",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 and @xmath76 on @xmath2 cancels to a large extent in the ratio @xmath3 , which is most relevant for the analysis of the hydrodynamic expansion of dense matter .",
    "this may be seen by considering the leading @xmath77 correction , @xmath78 \\left (   \\frac{\\mu_q}{t } \\right)^2",
    "\\right ) \\ ; . \\label{povere}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : soft ] we show @xmath3 as function of @xmath79 ( left ) as well as function of the energy density ( right ) . in the latter case we again used @xmath80  mev to set the scale . the small dependence on @xmath2 visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : soft](left ) gets further reduced when considering the ratio @xmath3 at fixed energy density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : soft](right ) ) . the softest point of the equation of state",
    "is found to be @xmath81 and within our current numerical accuracy it is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "however , the analysis of the temperature regime @xmath68 at present clearly suffers from poor statistics and still needs a more detailed analysis .",
    "we also find that the equation of state for @xmath82 is well parametrized by @xmath83 we note , however , that this phenomenological parametrization is not correct at asymptotically large temperatures as it is obvious that eq .",
    "[ fit ] would lead to corrections to the ideal gas result @xmath84 that are proportional to @xmath85 while perturbative corrections vanish only logarithmically as function of @xmath11 .",
    "we have determined taylor expansion coefficients for the energy and entropy densities in 2-flavor qcd at non - zero quark chemical potential . at present",
    "these expansion coefficients have been determined from calculations performed at one value of the bare quark mass which gives a good description of qcd thermodynamics at high temperature . in this",
    "temperature regime lines of constant entropy per baryon are well described by lines of constant @xmath1 . on these isentropic lines",
    "we have determined the equation of state and find that the ratio of pressure and energy density shows remarkably little dependence on the ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the regime close to and below the transition temperature @xmath15 is not yet well controlled in our current analysis .",
    "smaller quark masses and the introduction of a non - vanishing strange quark mass , kept fixed in physical units , will be needed to explore this regime as well as the approach to the 3-flavor high temperature limit in more detail .",
