    "the measurement of the total higgs width is one of the most important goals of a future @xmath4 collider . besides providing various other physics opportunities , such as the determination of the cp eigenvalues of a higgs boson , the photon linear collider ( plc ) offers so far the only possibility of a direct measurement of the partial width @xmath5 for an intermediate mass higgs particle @xcite . with the knowledge of the respective branching ratio br@xmath6 from a higgs production process at some earlier collider experiment @xcite",
    ", the total higgs width can be reconstructed .",
    "this in turn permits a model independent determination of various other partial widths .    using compton backscattering @xcite of initially polarized electrons and positrons at a linear collider ,",
    "the dominant background for a higgs boson below the @xmath7 threshold is from @xmath8 .",
    "while this background is suppressed by @xmath9 at the born level ( unlike the @xmath10 background which has no such mass suppression ) , higher  order perturbative qcd corrections remove this suppression @xcite .",
    "in addition , very large virtual ( non - sudakov ) double logarithms ( i.e. @xmath11 ) are present at each order in perturbation theory , and at one loop these can lead to a _ negative _ cross section in the central production region where the higgs signal is expected @xcite . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that positivity of the cross section is restored by the leading two  loop non  sudakov logarithmic corrections and recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , these corrections were resummed to all orders .",
    "the problem with previous @xcite phenomenological studies was that the large higher  order leading logarithmic corrections were not known and therefore not included .",
    "it is the purpose of this study to quantify the effect of these higher  order logarithms on the cross section .",
    "we include all the results presently available  the exact one  loop correction @xcite and the leading double logarithms to all orders  to make more reliable predictions for the higgs background .",
    "we do not attempt here a full monte carlo study of the signal and background taking all hadronization and detector effects into account .",
    "instead , we note that the dominant configuration of the higgs signal process is a pair of back  to  back jets , produced centrally , each containing a @xmath1 quark that can in principle be tagged using a vertex detector .",
    "we therefore calculate the background cross section for the same topology .",
    "note that this means excluding multi(@xmath12)jet topologies and also two - jet configurations arising from compton - like @xmath13 scatterings , as studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only one of the two jets contains a @xmath1 quark .    for simplicity ,",
    "we normalize all our cross sections to that of the leading order @xmath8 process .",
    "the born amplitude for this is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 label the helicities of the photon and quark respectively .",
    "the born cross section for the @xmath17 helicity state is then @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the quark velocity . here",
    "@xmath20 is the charge of the quark with mass @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the fine structure constant , @xmath23 is the quark scattering angle in the center  of  mass frame , and @xmath24 is the overall center  of  mass scattering energy .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin in the next section by summarizing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and discussing the real gluon emission contributions .",

    "( [ eq : ba ] ) receives large @xmath26 corrections at each order in perturbation theory .",
    "these ` novel ' hard double logarithms arise from corrections which are effectively cut off by _ quarks _ , rather than soft gluons which generate the usual sudakov double logarithms . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed how these new double logarithmic ( dl ) corrections can be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the result takes the form of a confluent hypergeometric function @xmath27 which possesses a @xmath28 high energy limit . taking into account",
    "the @xmath29 suppression contained in the born amplitude ( [ eq : ba ] ) , the new corrections are well behaved as @xmath30 .",
    "the series expansion agrees with the known one and two  loop results of refs .",
    "@xcite as well as our explicit three  loop calculation @xcite .",
    "it was furthermore shown in @xcite that at three loops all additional doubly logarithmic corrections are described by the exponentiation of sudakov logarithms at each order in the expansion of the new hard form factor .",
    "this behavior is already present at one and two loops and can thus safely be extrapolated to all orders .    for completeness , we list here the resulting virtual dl ",

    "the remaining double logarithmic corrections then come entirely from the hard @xmath50 non  sudakov form factor . in order to demonstrate the numerical impact of these logarithms we list the expansion of the @xmath50 piece in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dl ] ) . using the coefficients in the series expansion for the hypergeometric function ,",
    "we obtain the expansion through four loops : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is again the one  loop hard form factor .",

    "are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : relff ] .",
    "while taking only the three  loop expansion leads to a deviation of up to 50@xmath61 compared to the exact result , the four  loop dl cross section ( [ eq : sdl ] ) stays within a few percent . in the next section we present the results based on inclusion of the full one  loop radiative corrections including the full two  jet  like bremsstrahlung contribution",
    "the results of the previous section confirm that the hard double logarithms _ are _ numerically important when one is considering @xmath62 production in the @xmath63  gev energy range .",
    "the one  loop contribution on its own tends to drive the cross section negative , and stability is only achieved at four  loop order in the cross section .",
    "however before drawing definite conclusions , it is important to assess the other contributions to the physical cross section , in particular ( i ) the sub  leading logarithmic corrections to the virtual @xmath64 soft form factors and ( ii ) the contributions from hard gluon emission . unfortunately at present we know nothing about these beyond first order .",
    "however the first ",
    "order result _ is _ worth studying in detail , since it allows us to assess the dominance or otherwise of the ` @xmath65 ' hard double logarithm term in ( [ eq : sdl ] ) .",
    "we first need to define an infrared safe two  jet cross section .",
    "@xmath3 polarization state . ]",

    "weinberg ( sw ) two jet definition @xcite . at leading order ( i.e. @xmath66 )",
    "all events obviously satisfy the two@xmath1jet requirement .",
    "we apply an angular cut of @xmath67 to ensure that both jets lie in the central region .",
    "this defines our ` leading order ' ( lo ) cross section . at next  to  leading order ( nlo ) we can have virtual or real gluon emission . for the latter",
    ", an event is defined as two@xmath1jet like if the emitted gluon @xmath68 we will call the two regions of phase space i and ii respectively . we further subdivide region i according to whether the gluon energy is greater or less than the infrared cutoff , @xmath48 is an unphysical parameter introduced simply to separate soft and hard real emission . ]",
    "@xmath48 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we combine the region of soft real gluon phase space @xmath45 with the virtual gluon contribution to give @xmath70 .",
    "the region @xmath71 of ` hard ' real gluon phase space @xmath72 then defines @xmath73 .",
    "the total nlo two@xmath1jet cross section is then @xmath74    the cross section for @xmath70 is obtained from the analytic expression given in @xcite , while @xmath73 and @xmath75 are computed using the numerical program of @xcite . a powerful consistency check on the overall calculation",
    "is that the sum @xmath76 should be independent of the unphysical parameter @xmath48 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : insens3 ] , which shows the individual contributions as a function of @xmath24 for two choices , @xmath77  gev and @xmath78  gev and with @xmath79 . while the individual contributions are of course different ( the leading behavior as @xmath80 is @xmath81 for the separate sv and @xmath82 contributions ) , the sums are indistinguishable .",
    "we can therefore conclude that for this part of the two  jet phase space ( @xmath83 ) , the next  to  leading order cross section is between @xmath84 and @xmath85 times the leading order cross section .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : insens3 ] is the ` @xmath65 ' hard double logarithm contribution .",
    "quite remarkably , this is close to the complete result , demonstrating that the net effect of the additional subleading real and virtual contributions is small and positive , at least for this choice of parameters ( in particular @xmath86 ) .",
    "in fact to a very good approximation , in this energy range , @xmath87\\ ] ] we may conclude that including the higher  order terms in the hard form factor _ does _ give an improved prediction for the cross section , and in particular restores positivity for this region of two  jet phase space .",
    "the remaining part of the two@xmath1jet cross section , @xmath75 , is shown relative to @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ fig : insens4 ] , for three choices of the cone size @xmath38 .",
    "consistent with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : insens3 ] , the parameter @xmath86 is again fixed at 0.1 .",
    "notice that this part of the two  jet cross section is large and positive and approximately linear in @xmath38 .",
    "the reason for this was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite : for @xmath89 the @xmath90 cross section behaves as @xmath91\\ ] ] i.e. with _ no _ @xmath92 suppression .",
    "this part of the cross section is therefore dominated by hard gluon emission , i.e. the @xmath1 quark in one of the two @xmath1jets is likely to be soft .",
    "the non@xmath92suppressed cross section has no collinear singularity either , and so the dependence on the cone size @xmath38 is simply determined by phase space , i.e. @xmath93 , for @xmath94 .",
    "an efficient suppression of the background to the higgs signal will therefore necessitate selecting narrow @xmath1 jets in which the heavy quark carries a large fraction of the jet momentum .",
    "in the previous section we have studied two types of correction to the ( @xmath95 ) @xmath96 cross section : the all  orders resummed hard quark mass double logarithms , and the exact next - to - leading order ( one  loop ) corrections .",
    "motivated by the topology of the higgs signal , to which our contributions are a background , we have focused on the two@xmath1jet cross section , defined here by two parameters , an ` energy outside the cone ' parameter @xmath86 and a cone size parameter @xmath38 . furthermore we have shown that the part of the nlo cross section corresponding to virtual and soft real gluon emission is dominated by the leading double hard logarithm .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of resumming these contributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard collinear gluon part of the cross section is sizable and depends quite sensitively on the jet parameters .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] , where we display ( solid curves ) the total two  jet cross section ( i.e. exact next  to  leading order contribution plus resummed hard form factor ) for four choices of the parameters @xmath97 . also shown ( dashed curve ) is the hard form factor part alone .",
    "this is of course independent of the jet definition .",
    "the form factor evidently gives a significant contribution to the total cross section , especially for narrow jets . from fig .",
    "1 , we see also that using only the one  loop ( @xmath65 ) part of the hard form factor would result in a _ negative _ two  jet cross section for narrow jets , a result first pointed out in @xcite . with the resummed form factor , positivity and stability is restored .",
    "an additional potentially important higher  order contribution for large energies comes from the square of the _ imaginary _ part of the one  loop box diagram .",
    "an explicit calculation gives @xcite @xmath98 note that , unlike @xmath99 , this contribution has no @xmath100 suppression and therefore eventually dominates the cross section at very high scattering energy .",
    "for the energies considered here , however , it is negligible .",
    "what can we say about the corrections not included in fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] ?",
    "of course the unknown exact nnlo corrections could be important , especially for the hard collinear contributions to the two  jet cross section .",
    "we note here that , as at nlo , there is no @xmath100 suppression of such terms , but tightening the two  jet requirement will tend to reduce their significance .",
    "we might again expect that the hard form factor is the dominant part of the virtual / soft multigluon contributions .",
    "note also that as long as the parameter @xmath86 is not taken to be too small , in which case large logarithms ( @xmath101 ) would require resummation , the sudakov form factor ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : vps ] ) ) should not play a major role .",
    "finally , it is possible that the sub - leading ( e.g. @xmath102 ) logarithmic contributions to the hard form factor are important ( although this is not suggested by our exact next  to  leading order studies ) .",
    "the calculation beyond nlo would seem to be an extremely difficult task however @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated the numerical importance of the ` hard ' ( non - sudakov ) @xmath103 contributions to the @xmath104 @xmath66 cross section at typical photon collider energies relevant for intermediate  mass higgs searches .",
    "our study , although it includes for the first time all the currently available theoretical information , is of course far from complete . we have not , for example , included running @xmath105 , hadronization or detector effects",
    ". these would require dedicated monte carlo studies , such as those performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for example . in this context",
