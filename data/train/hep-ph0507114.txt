    "the precision measurement of the radiative decay mode @xmath0 has provided an exciting opportunity to test the standard model(sm ) and beyond . besides the branching ratio , the isospin asymmetry in this process which is defined as : @xmath12 could prove to be an important observable for examining the sm as well as discriminating between various new physics scenarios .",
    "the data from belle@xcite and babar@xcite point to isospin asymmetries of at most a few percent and consistent with zero within the experimental error : @xmath13 where @xmath11 is defined as in eq.([isospinasym ] ) but using the charge conjugate modes . the last error in eq.([babar ] )",
    "is due to the uncertainty in the ratio of the branching fractions of the neutral and charged b meson production in @xmath14 decays .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the non - spectator contributions and has been estimated to be around a few percent in the sm within the qcd factorization approach in refs . @xcite and @xcite , brodsky - lepage formalism @xcite and the perturbative qcd method in ref .",
    "the more accurate measurement of the isospin asymmetry in the near future and a better understanding of the sm prediction for this observable should provide a sensitive testing venue for possible models of new physics .",
    "one such model is the extension of the sm with an extra generation of iso - singlet quarks@xcite . unlike the three generations of ordinary quarks in the sm , both the left- and the right - handed components of the quarks of this additional generation are invariant under @xmath15 gauge group .",
    "therefore , the flavor changing weak interactions of these exotic quarks proceeds only through mixing with ordinary quarks and this results in the non - unitarity of the extended @xmath16 quark mixing matrix and thus non - vanishing flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at the tree level .",
    "isospin asymmetry in @xmath0 transitions offers an excellent physical observable for constraining the parameters of this so - called vector quark model ( vqm ) .",
    "as is shown in our result , nonspectator effects like the isospin and direct cp asymmetry in @xmath0 offer the advantage of being sensitive to only one model parameter , namely the non - unitarity parameter @xmath2 and therefore , can provide a good constraint on the size of the fcnc in the context of vqm irrespective of the masses of the additional quarks .",
    "the non - vanishing fcnc at the tree level leads to an additional contributing feynmann diagram which is illustrated in fig . [ fig1 ] . the amplitude for @xmath17 transition via @xmath18 exchange in the vqm",
    "can be written as@xcite : @xmath19\\;\\ ; , \\label{vqmamp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a measure of the non - unitarity of the extended quark mixing matrix and @xmath21 is the third component of the weak isospin of quark flavor @xmath22 .",
    "one can then write ( [ vqmamp ] ) in terms of the effective operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are defined as : @xmath25 and therefore the contribution of the extra vector quarks results in additional terms in the wilson coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 to the leading order in the strong coupling @xmath28",
    ". @xmath29 with the upper bound",
    "@xmath30 coming from the rare b decays @xcite , the additional contribution due to the tree level fcnc could be comparable to the sm value of these coefficients at @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    here an explanation is in order .",
    "strictly speaking , one should include the extra terms given in eq .",
    "( [ wilsoncoef ] ) , which are proportional to the electric charge of the light quark , in the electroweak penguin operators @xmath34@xcite .",
    "however , since , as far as nonspectator effects to the leading order of @xmath28 are concerned , one can ignore these operators within sm , we prefer to write the additional vqm - generated contributions in terms of the dominant qcd penguin operators . in any case ,",
    "our results do not change had we followed the strict formulation of the problem .    following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can write the nonspectator contributions to @xmath0 amplitude as @xmath35 , where @xmath22 is the flavor of the light anti - quark in the b meson and @xmath36 is the leading spectator amplitude . to leading order in the strong coupling constant @xmath28 ,",
    "the main contribution to @xmath0 is from the electromagnetic penguin operator @xmath37 and the factorizable amplitude @xmath36 is proportional to the form factor @xmath38 which parameterizes the hadronic matrix element of this operator to the leading order in @xmath39 .",
