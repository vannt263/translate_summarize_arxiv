    "probabilistic cellular automata ( pca ) have been widely used to model a variety of systems with local interactions in physics , chemistry , biology and social sciences  @xcite .",
    "moreover , pca are simple and interesting models that can be used to investigate fundamental problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "many classical equilibrium spin models can be reformulated as pca , for example the kinetic ising model with parallel heat - bath dynamics is strictly equivalent to a pca with local parallel dynamics  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "pca can be mapped to spin models  @xcite by expressing the transition probabilities as exponentials of a local energy .",
    "pca can be used to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena , and in particular the problem of phase transitions in the presence of absorbing states .",
    "an absorbing state is represented by a set of configurations from which the system can not escape , equivalent to an infinite energy well in the language of statistical mechanics .",
    "a global absorbing state can be originated by one or more local transition probabilities which take the value zero or one , corresponding to some infinite coupling in the local energy  @xcite .",
    "the domany - kinzel ( dk ) model is a boolean pca on a tilted square lattice that has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "let us denote the two possible states of each site with the terms `` empty '' and `` occupied '' . in this model",
    "a site at time @xmath0 is connected to two sites at time @xmath1 , constituting its neighborhood .",
    "the control parameters of the model are the local transition probabilities that give the probability of having an occupied site at a certain position once given the state of its neighborhood .",
    "the transition probabilities are symmetric for all permutations of the neighborhood , and this property is equivalent to saying that they depend on the sum of `` occupied '' sites in the neighborhood , whence the term `` totalistic '' used to denote this class of automata .    in the dk model the transition probability from an empty neighborhood to an occupied state is zero , thus the empty configuration is an absorbing state . for small values of the other transition probabilities",
    ", any initial configuration will evolve to the absorbing state . for larger values , a phase transition to an active phase , represented by an ensemble of partially occupied configurations , is found .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the asymptotic average fraction of occupied sites , which we call the density .",
    "the critical properties of this phase transition belong to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class ( except for one extreme point )  @xcite , and the dk model is often considered the prototype of such a class .",
    "the evolution of this kind of models is the discrete equivalent of the trajectory of a stochastic dynamical system .",
    "one can determine the sensitivity with respect to a perturbation , by studying the trajectories originating by two initially different configurations ( replicas ) evolving with the same realization of the stochasticity , e.g.  using the same sequence of random numbers .",
    "the order parameter here is the asymptotic difference between the two replicas , which we call the damage .",
    "it turns out that , inside the active phase , there is a `` chaotic '' phase in which the trajectories depend on the initial configurations and the damage is different from zero , and a non chaotic one in which all trajectories eventually synchronize with the vanishing of the damage . in simple models like the dk one ,",
    "this transition does not depend on the choice of the initial configurations ( provided they are different from the absorbing state ) and the initial damage  @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that all second - order phase transitions from an `` active '' phase to a non degenerate , quiescent phase ( generally represented by an absorbing state ) belong to the dp universality class if the order parameter is a scalar and there are no extra symmetries or conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "this has been verified in a wide class of models , even multi - component , and in the presence of several asymmetric absorbing states  @xcite .",
    "also the damage phase transition has a similar structure .",
    "once synchronized , the two replicas can not separate , and thus the synchronized state is absorbing .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations shows that it is in the dp universality class  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the dk model , the damage phase transition can be mapped onto the density one  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "some models with conserved quantities  @xcite or symmetric absorbing states belong to a different universality class called parity conservation ( pc ) or directed ising  @xcite .",
    "this universality class appears to be less robust since it is strictly related to the symmetry of the absorbing states ; a slight asymmetry is sufficient to bring the model to the usual dp class  @xcite .    an interesting question concerns the simplest , one - dimensional pca model with short range interactions exhibiting a first order phase transition .",
    "dickman and tom  @xcite proposed a contact process with spontaneous annihilation , auto catalytic creation by trimers and hopping .",
    "they found a first order transition for high hopping probability , i.e. ,  in the region more similar to mean field ( weaker spatial correlations ) .",
    "bassler and browne discussed a model whose phase diagram also presents first and second - order phase transitions  @xcite . in it ,",
    "monomers of three different chemical species can be adsorbed on a one - dimensional surface and neighboring monomers belonging to different species annihilate instantaneously .",
    "the control parameters of the model are the absorption rates of the monomers .",
    "the transition from a saturate to a reactive phase belongs to the dp universality class , while the transition between two saturated phases is discontinuous .",
    "the point at which three phase transition lines join does belong to the pc universality class .",
    "scaling and fluctuations near first order phase transitions are also an interesting subject of study  @xcite , which can profit from the existence of simple models .    in this paper",
    "we study a one - dimensional , one - component , totalistic pca with two absorbing states .",
    "it can be considered as a natural extension of the dk model to a lattice in which the neighborhood of a site at time @xmath0 contains the site itself and its two nearest neighbors at time @xmath1 .",
    "this space - time lattice arises naturally in the discretization of one - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems . in our model ,",
    "the transition probabilities from an empty neighborhood is zero , and that from a completely occupied neighborhood is one .",
    "the model has two absorbing states : the completely empty and the completely occupied configurations .",
    "the order parameter is again the density ; it is zero or one in the two quiescent phases , and assumes other values in the active phase .",
    "the system presents a line of symmetry in the phase diagram , over which the two absorbing phases have the same importance .",
    "a more detailed illustration of the model can be found in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "this model can arise as a particular case of a nonequilibrium wetting of a surface . in this framework",
    ", only a single layer of particles can be absorbed on the surface .",
    "if we assume that particles can be absorbed or desorbed only near the boundaries of a patch of already absorbed particles ( when the neighborhood is not homogeneous ) , then the completely empty and occupied configurations are absorbing states .",
    "this totalistic pca can also be interpreted as a simple model of opinion formation .",
    "it assumes that an individual may change his mind according to himself and his two nearest neighbors .",
    "the role of social pressure is twofold .",
    "if there is homogeneity of opinions , individuals can not disagree ( absorbing states ) , otherwise they can agree or disagree with the majority with a certain probability .",
    "the density phase diagram shows two second order phase transition curves separating the quiescent phases from the active one , and a first order transition line between the two quiescent phases , as discussed in section  [ sec : phasediagram ] .",
    "these curves meet on the line of symmetry in a bicritical point .",
    "we use both mean field approximations and direct numerical simulations .",
    "the former simple approximation gives a qualitatively correct phase diagram .",
    "the numerical experiments are partially based on the fragment method  @xcite .",
    "this is a parallel algorithm that implements directly the evolution rule for different values of the control parameters on the bits of one or more computer words .    in section  [ sec : critical ] , we investigate numerically the second order phase transitions and find they belong to the dp universality class . along the line of symmetry of the model",
    "the two absorbing phases are equivalent . in appendix",
    "[ app : kinks ] we show that on this line one can reformulate the problem in terms of the dynamics of kinks between patches of empty and occupied sites .",
    "since the kinks are created and annihilated in pairs , the dynamics conserves the initial number of kinks modulo two . in this way we can present an exact mapping between a model with symmetric absorbing phases and one with parity conservation .",
    "we find that the critical kink dynamics at the bicritical point belongs to the pc universality class .",
    "in section  [ sec : chaotic ] we study the chaotic phase , using dynamic mean field techniques ( reported in appendix  [ app : meandamage ] ) and direct numerical simulations .",
    "the location of this phase is similar to that of the dk model : it joins the second - order critical curves at the boundary of the phase diagram .",
    "our model exhibits a first - order phase transition along the line of symmetry in the upper part of the phase diagram .",
    "a first - order transition is usually associated to an hysteresis cycle .",
    "it is possible to observe such a phenomena by adding a small perturbing field to the absorbing states , as discussed in section  [ sec : firstorder ] .",
    "the dp universality class is equivalent to the reggeon field theory  @xcite , which in @xmath2 corresponds to a quadratic potential with a logarithmic divergence at the origin .",
    "the langevin description for systems in the pc class yields a similar potential , except for irrelevant terms  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that one can reconstruct the potential from the numerical integration of the langevin equation , which , however , requires special techniques in the presence of absorbing states  @xcite . in section  [ sec : reconstruction ]",
    "we show how the potential is reconstructed from actual simulations of a phenomenological model , such as our original cellular automata or the kink dynamics . in this way",
    "we obtain the shape of the potential for a system in the parity conservation universality class .",
    "we describe here a one - dimensional , totalistic , probabilistic cellular automaton with three inputs .",
    "the state of the model at time @xmath0 is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the number of sites .",
    "all operations on spatial indices are assumed to be modulo @xmath6 ( periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we write @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we shall indicate by @xmath11 number of occupied cells in the neighborhood .",

    "we implement @xmath15 by extracting a random number @xmath18 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , and setting @xmath15 equal to 1 if @xmath19 and 0 otherwise .",
    ".   implies the use of four random numbers @xmath18 for each site .",
    "the evolution of a single trajectory is not affected by the eventual correlations among the @xmath18 , since only one @xmath20 is different from zero .",
    "this is not true when computing the simultaneous evolution of two or more replicas using the same noise .",
    "if not otherwise stated , we use only one random number for all the @xmath18 .",

    "the damage region is shown in shades of grey . outside this region there appear small damaged domains on the other phase boundaries .",
    "this is due either to the divergence of the relaxation time ( second - order transitions ) or to the fact that a small difference in the initial configuration can drive the system to a different absorbing state ( first - order transitions ) .",

    "eventually the first fixed point disappears , and the asymptotic density jumps to the stable fixed point close to one . going backwards on the same line , the asymptotic density will be close to one until that fixed point disappears and it will jump back to a small value close to zero . by symmetry , the hysteresis loop is centered around the line @xmath50 which we identify as a first - order phase transition line inside the hatched region .",
