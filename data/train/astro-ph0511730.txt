    "over the past twenty years many techniques have been devised to estimate the global star - formation rates ( sfrs ) of galaxies .",
    "the first quantitative analysis of sfrs using the @xmath4 nebular recombination line was undertaken by @xcite .",
    "today , with the advent of large , multi - wavelength surveys of galaxies , virtually every part of the electromagnetic spectrum has been explored as a means of deriving sfrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two indicators directly associated with massive star formation are the ultraviolet ( uv ; @xmath22   ) and nebular recombination line luminosities .",
    "these techniques were particularly important in establishing the order - of - magnitude rise in the sfr density of the universe from the present day to @xmath23 and beyond @xcite . despite considerable progress in measuring sfrs of distant galaxies",
    ", however , their accuracy remains limited by a wide range of systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "well - calibrated sfr diagnostics with well - understood systematic uncertainties are needed to improve constraints on the evolution of the cosmic sfr , and to investigate the physical processes responsible for this evolution . in this paper",
    "we carry out a detailed empirical analysis of rest - frame optical sfr indicators .",
    "one of the most well - understood sfr indicators is @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath21 luminosity is directly proportional to the hydrogen - ionizing radiation from massive ( @xmath24  @xmath25 ) stars , and therefore provides a near - instantaneous ( @xmath26  myr ) measure of the sfr with minimal dependence on the physical conditions of the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath21 is only observable from the ground at @xmath27 in the optical , and at @xmath28 through the near - infrared atmospheric windows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zlambda ] ) . given the observational difficulties of observing @xmath21 at high redshift , therefore , the [  ii ]  @xmath6 nebular emission line has been suggested as an alternative sfr indicator @xcite .",
    "its intrinsic strength and blue rest - frame wavelength allow it to be measured even in low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra at @xmath29 in the optical , and at @xmath30 in the near - infrared ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zlambda ] ) .",
    "the [  ii ] luminosity depends explicitly on the chemical abundance and excitation state of the ionized gas , and suffers a larger amount of dust extinction than @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , unlike the balmer recombination lines , [  ii ] is not directly proportional to the sfr and must be calibrated either empirically @xcite , or theoretically @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the first quantitative analysis of [  ii ] as a sfr indicator using [  ii ] and @xmath9 measurements of a sample of @xmath31 blue - irregular galaxies .",
    "@xcite improved upon this study by obtaining integrated optical ( @xmath32   ) spectra of @xmath33 galaxies spanning the hubble sequence , including a handful of peculiar objects , and derived the first empirical calibration of [  ii ] relative to @xmath21 .",
    "previously , the equivalent width of [  ii ] was used only indirectly to infer ongoing star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "subsequently , @xcite and @xcite used the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an imaging and spectrophotometric survey of a representative sample of @xmath34 nearby galaxies , to quantify how variations in reddening and chemical abundance affect the observed [  ii ] luminosity , and to improve the [  ii ] sfr calibration .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed ratio varies by a factor of @xmath35 near @xmath36 , predominantly due to variations in dust reddening , and that the ratio is inversely proportional to galaxy luminosity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . comparing the nfgs observations to photoionization models",
    ", @xcite concluded that the ratio is also strongly dependent on the heavy element abundance and varies weakly with the strength of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "however , all these studies have been based on relatively small samples of optically selected normal galaxies exhibiting modest current - to - past - averaged star - formation rates , normal morphologies , and typical or lower - than - average infrared luminosities . from models of hierarchical galaxy formation ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , we anticipate a higher incidence of extreme or bursty star formation at high redshift due to a greater frequency of mergers / interactions and larger reservoirs of neutral gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , sfr calibrations based on local samples of normal galaxies may not apply at high redshift .",
    "large spectrophotometric surveys of the nearby universe such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide the opportunity to study the emission - line properties of galaxies with unprecedented statistical precision ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite present a thorough analysis of multi - wavelength sfr diagnostics in the sdss .",
    "however , the fraction of light subtended by the @xmath37 fiber - optic aperture utilized by the sdss depends on the distance and intrinsic properties ( size , bulge - to - disk ratio , surface - brightness distribution , etc . ) of each individual galaxy .",
    "for example , in the star - forming galaxy sample studied by @xcite the median light fraction is only @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the sdss s strict magnitude - limited selection ( @xmath39  mag ) targets primarily the most luminous present - day galaxies , which are unlikely to be representative of high - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "therefore , empirical sfr calibrations based on sdss observations should not be applied blindly to distant samples .    as part of a larger effort to characterize the physical properties of star - forming galaxies , we have obtained high s / n optical spectrophotometry ( @xmath40   at @xmath41   fwhm resolution ) for a diverse sample of @xmath42 nearby galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mk05 ) .",
    "this survey targets objects that represent a small fraction of the galaxy population today , but which may be more typical of high - redshift samples , including starbursts , interacting / merging systems , and dusty , infrared - luminous galaxies ; the sample also includes a large number of normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "we utilize the long - slit drift - scanning technique developed by @xcite to obtain spatially integrated spectra at intermediate spectral resolution , which makes our observations well - matched to traditional long - slit spectroscopy of distant galaxies .",
    "we supplement our new observations with the nfgs to increase the number of normal galaxies , and to identify any selection biases in our diverse sample of galaxies .",
    "in addition , we compare our analysis of optical sfr diagnostics against a sample of @xmath43 star - forming galaxies from the sdss in order to assess the effects of statistical incompleteness and aperture bias in our integrated galaxy sample and in the sdss , respectively .",
    "we use these data to study the [  ii ]  @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and [  iii ]  @xmath7 nebular emission lines as quantitative sfr diagnostics by comparing them against sfrs derived from the extinction - corrected @xmath21 luminosity .",

    "we briefly summarize the relevant details of each survey , and refer the reader to the original papers for more information regarding the sample selection and data reductions .",
    "the mk05 survey provides high s / n optical ( @xmath40   ) spectrophotometry at @xmath41   fwhm resolution for @xmath42 nearby galaxies .",
    "based on a variety of internal and external comparisons mk05 find that the relative spectrophotometric precision of the data is @xmath49 .",
    "the survey roughly divides into four major subsamples : ( 1 ) @xmath50 galaxies selected from the first byurakan survey of uv - excess galaxies @xcite ; ( 2 ) @xmath51 infrared - luminous galaxies selected from the iras warm and bright galaxy surveys @xcite ; ( 3 ) @xmath52 morphologically selected interacting / merging systems drawn from the ph .  d. thesis sample of @xcite ; and ( 4 ) @xmath53 normal galaxies selected from a volume - limited @xmath21- and uv - imaging survey of the @xmath54  mpc local volume ( r.  c. kennicutt et  al . , 2006 , in preparation ) , and the ursa major cluster @xcite .",
    "these samples are intentionally chosen to span the diverse range of galaxies in the local universe with active star formation , both to improve our understanding of galactic star formation and to serve as a more comprehensive reference sample for lookback studies . to provide a more representative , complementary sample of nearby galaxies we turn to the nfgs .",

    "self - consistently corrected for underlying stellar absorption .",
    "we measure the emission - line fluxes and equivalent widths of the strong nebular lines , tabulated in mk05 , using simultaneous , multi - gaussian profile fitting with physically motivated constraints on the intrinsic velocity widths and redshifts of the balmer and forbidden lines . for consistency",
    "we re - measure the emission - line fluxes in the nfgs spectra using ispec1d .",
    "we find our measurements broadly consistent with @xcite , except at low equivalent widths where we argue that our technique is more reliable .    to define a sample of star - forming galaxies and to ensure that we can measure reliably the nebular reddening (  [ sec : reddening ] ) , we impose a @xmath60 s / n cut on the @xmath21 and @xmath9 emission lines , which removes @xmath61 objects from the integrated sample .",
    "we verify that most of these objects are early - type ( e / s0 ) galaxies with effectively zero star formation .",
    "however , three galaxies ( ngc  1266 , ugc  05101 , and cgcg  049 - 057 ) fail our s / n criterion on @xmath9 because they are dusty , infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "all three objects have well - detected @xmath21 emission , and in only one do we marginally detect [  ii ] . since these galaxies comprise @xmath62 of the full integrated sample , and just @xmath63 of objects with @xmath64 (  [ sec : ha_sfr ] ) , we do not expect our conclusions to be biased with respect to highly obscured galaxies . however , these types of objects emphasize the need for either @xmath21 or infrared observations to ensure a complete census of star formation in galaxies .",

    "the dashed curve defines the theoretical boundary between agn and star - forming galaxies presented by @xcite .",
    "we conservatively adopt the @xcite curve to remove objects with agn activity , although in  [ sec : results ] we explore the effect of including agn on our results .",

    "<S> using integrated optical spectrophotometry for @xmath0 star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 , and fiber - aperture spectrophotometry for @xmath2 sdss galaxies at @xmath3 , we investigate the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , [  ii ]  @xmath6 , and [  iii ]  @xmath7 nebular emission lines and the @xmath8-band luminosity as quantitative star - formation rate ( sfr ) indicators . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the extinction - corrected @xmath4 luminosity is a reliable sfr tracer even in highly obscured star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that variations in dust reddening dominate the systematic uncertainty in sfrs derived from the observed @xmath9 , [  ii ] , and @xmath8-band luminosities , producing a factor of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 scatter in the mean transformations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that [  ii ] depends weakly on variations in oxygen abundance over a wide range in metallicity , @xmath13  dex ( @xmath14 ) , and that in this metallicity interval galaxies occupy a narrow range in ionization parameter ( @xmath15  dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the scatter in [  iii ]  @xmath7 as a sfr indicator is a factor of @xmath16 due to its sensitivity to metal abundance and ionization . </S>",
    "<S> we develop empirical sfr calibrations for @xmath9 and [  ii ] parameterized in terms of the @xmath17-band luminosity , which remove the systematic effects of reddening and metallicity , and reduce the sfr scatter to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , although individual galaxies may deviate substantially from the median relations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the @xmath1 relations between blue luminosity and reddening , ionization , and ratio against measurements at @xmath20 and find broad agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize , however , that optical emission - line measurements including @xmath21 for larger samples of intermediate- and high - redshift galaxies are needed to test the applicability of our locally derived sfr calibrations to distant galaxies . </S>"
