    "photons striking the photocathode in a pmt produce photoelectrons ( pes ) , whose number is amplified via a dynode chain ; the magnitude of the current so produced is proportional to the number of incident photons whose energy is above a certain threshold .",
    "a specific operating voltage must be found for each pmt so that all tubes have the proper gain .",
    "gain is defined here as observed output charge ( divided by charge per electron ) per input photoelectron . the charge and timing information recorded from each pmt",
    "can then be used to reconstruct the events off - line .",
    "ideally , this information , along with photocathode efficiency as determined by hamamatsu , specifies exactly when and how many photons hit the pmt .",
    "each pmt is tested in several ways to determine : basic functionality , timing resolution , charge resolution , dark rate and operating voltage .",
    "the operating voltage was chosen so that the gain is closest to the desired @xmath2 signal electrons per photoelectron .",
    "in addition to these global pmt tests , specialty tests were done on seven pmts . in order for the monte carlo simulation to properly model the behavior of the pmts ,",
    "it is necessary to correctly include their efficiency as a function of incident photon angle .",
    "the dominant effect comes simply from the solid angle subtended by a pmt as a function of angle , and this is handled by coding an approximate pmt shape into the simulation .",
    "any remaining efficiency function must be measured and entered into the code .",
    "the measurement , however , will itself contain the solid angle effects ; these must be factored out of the measured angular efficiency to avoid double - counting .",

    "phototubes in the miniboone detector satisfy the following technical requirements .",
    "their maximum dark rates lie below the response rate expected from cosmic rays .",
    "their gains are high , around @xmath3 , to be adequately sensitive .",
    "their responses are reliably fast , and have a narrow enough pulse width to minimize response pileup .",
    "each of these characteristics was tested ; these tests are described in subsequent sections .",
    "the two models ( r5912 and r1408 ) of phototubes used in miniboone differ primarily in their dynode structures and number of stages , and are similar in all the characteristics described above .",
    "the r5912 is a ten - dynode - stage photomultiplier tube with an 8 inch hemispherical photocathode .",
    "the base supplies the high voltages for the grids , dynodes , and anode , and provides the back termination in the anode circuit .",
    "the voltage divider chain is entirely passive , and is fabricated with carbon - film resistors and ceramic - disk capacitors .",
    "a single coaxial cable is used to provide high voltage ( on the order of 1500v ) and to connect the anode signal to the readout .",
    "the anode circuit is back terminated in 50 @xmath4 and balanced to compensate for the distortion caused by the capacitive coupling in the termination circuit .",
    "the high voltage taper is the one recommended by hamamatsu ( ca .",

    "the detector design requires that the tubes , bases , and cables be immersed in oil for several years without adversely affecting the phototubes or the oil . to accomplish this",
    ", the bases and necks of all miniboone pmts were coated with the two - component epoxy ep21lv from masterbond @xcite , which is impervious to and insoluble in oil .",

    "the method of global testing for the pmts has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite ; a synopsis of that report is provided here .",
    "the purpose of global testing was to select an operating voltage which resulted in a similar response from each pmt , regardless of model ( r1408 or r5912 ) .",
    "the selected gain was @xmath510@xmath6 electrons per photoelectron ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the testing process served to determine five characteristic data about each pmt : dark rate , time jitter , charge resolution , double - pulsing rate , and pulse shape .",
    "these data were used to sort the tubes into five categories , from best to worst in timing and charge resolution .",
    "categories 4 and 5 had similar resolutions , and were divided between the two categories by dark rate .",
    "these classifications were used to distribute tubes ranked 1 through 4 ( with about 320 in each rank ) evenly throughout the tank .",
    "category 5 tubes were used in the veto , where timing and charge resolution is less crucial but low dark rate is important . [",

    "the full setup accommodated 30 r1408 pmts and 16 r5912 pmts .",

    "first , the dark rate rates were collected by recording the noise rates measured at a range of operating voltages , with no light source .",
    "second , the pmts were illuminated by an led light source whose wavelength was 450  nm ( corresponding approximately to the erenkov frequency of the oil ) .",
    "the source flashed at a rate of 1  khz ; the width of each pulse was 1  ns .",
    "pmt responses to 600 - 1000 led flashes were used to determine the operating voltage for the required gain .",
    "this procedure also allowed both the charge and time resolutions , and pre- and post - pulsing anomalies to be studied .",
    "each pmt was tested to determine its operating voltage , as well as its gain , dark rate , charge resolution , timing resolution , and double pulsing rate .",
    "the results of the later five measurements are reported below .",
    "pmt gain corresponds to the mean number of electrons produced by the phototube in response to one pe .",
    "this was determined using the equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total charge from the pmt for all pulses with response past threshold , @xmath11 is the number of responses past threshold , and @xmath12 is the light level .",
    "total charge was computed by summing up charge in the main pmt pulse for all responses with in - time pulses that pass threshold , excluding double pulses .",
    "the second factor is the reciprocal of the average number of pes seen by a pmt for a given light level , @xmath12 , ( excluding zero responses ) predicted from poisson statistics .",
    "the voltage was selected in order to obtain a gain of @xmath13 electrons per @xmath7 .",
    "the distribution of operating voltages at which the pmts run in the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opvolts ] .",
    "dark rate is defined as the number of pulses larger than 3  mv in one second .",
    "the experiment required that the tubes operate with a dark rate below 8  khz in the main tank and below 4  khz in the veto .",
    "dark rates were measured over a range of voltages , from several hundred volts below suggested operating voltage up to operating voltage and above .",
    "plots of dark rate versus voltage , or plateau plots , serve as a measure of pmt quality .",
    "the pmts are operated on the plateau , where dark rate does not change significantly as the operating voltage increases .",
    "the r1408 pmts were found to have poorly defined plateaus , but they were considered acceptable if the dark rates had a steady , shallow rise when the operating voltage was increased .    the charge resolution , @xmath14 is determined from the width of the peak in the pmt response corresponding to one pe . the distribution of charge resolutions for all pmts is shown in fig .  [ fig : chargedist2 ] .",
    "the time jitter in the measurements is dominated by the timing resolution of the pmts ; the timing resolution of the oscilloscope was found to be negligible .",
    "the distribution of timing resolutions for all pmts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedist2 ] .",
    "pre- and post - pulsing , where the main pmt pulse is preceded or followed by additional small pulses , is a known effect in the types of pmts used on miniboone @xcite .",
    "pre - pulsing was observed in only four r1408 tubes , which were rejected .",
    "post - pulsing occurs in two different time intervals : between 8 - 60  ns after the main pulse , and 100  ns-16  @xmath12s after the main pulse .",
    "miniboone is concerned about the first case ( `` early post - pulsing '' ) , because data in the detector are recorded in 100  ns intervals , making it unlikely that the second case will contaminate events .",
    "early post - pulsing can begin when an electron accelerated to the first dynode starts a typical cascade , and causes another electron to be ejected from the first dynode .",
    "this second electron can move around the inside of the pmt dome before settling back to the first dynode and initiating a second cascade , which becomes the post - pulse .",
    "hamamatsu reports that r5912 and r1408 pmts are expected to have early post - pulses in @xmath15 of the responses from every tube .",
    "miniboone observed higher rates .",
    "pmts were required to have a double - pulsing rate of @xmath16 for the r5912 pmts and @xmath15 for the r1408 pmts at the time of installation .",

    "extensive specialized testing was done on seven phototubes to explore the behavior of other important parameters , especially the dependence of the pmt response on the angle of the incoming light .",
    "the data from r1408 and r5912 tubes were kept separate until the final analyses .",
    "the main objective of the angular tests was to find how the response of the pmts depended on the angle of incident light .",
    "there were three additional tests .",
    "one tested a few tubes at various voltages .",
    "another rotated the tubes about two orthogonal axes arbitrarily labelled  yaw \" and  pitch \" to test the assumption that the tubes are rotationally symmetric .",
    "the last tested tubes in air , without the oil present in the other tests .",
    "the apparatus used for these tests is designed to replicate as closely as possible the characteristics of the miniboone detector , on a much smaller and more manageable scale .",
    "the central part of the apparatus is a 40 gallon , stainless steel tank , painted on the inside with the paint used in the detector tank : a primer and black top coat . the primer is hydralon p water - based epoxy primer ( sherwin williams e72ac500/v66vc503 hydralon p water - based epoxy primer ) , and the black topcoat is a flat black moisture cure aliphatic polyurethane chemical agent resistive coating ( f93b102 flat black moisture cure polyurethane ) .",
    "the tank can be filled with miniboone oil when tests require it .",
    "it houses a single pmt , which can be rotated along the polar or azimuthal angle of the tube , using two precision rotary tables , one for pitch and one for yaw with respect to the table .",
    "the tubes were fixed to these tables with an arbitrary rotation , so  pitch \" and  yaw \" refer only to the mechanical apparatus and not any characteristic of the tubes .",
    "these tables have externally - coupled mechanical controls which allow the phototube position angle to be changed without opening the tank and exposing the tube to light .",
    "a 10.25 inch diameter window at the front of the tank allows the tests to simulate the light in miniboone events by propagating the light several meters before it strikes the phototube . because of this window",
    ", the entire testing room must be kept dark throughout each test .",
    "the light source is a picoquant pls 450 , a sub - nanosecond pulsed led .",
    "its center wavelength is 460  nm , with 50  @xmath12w average power at 40  mhz , approximately 30  nm spectral width , and typically 800  ps pulse width .",
    "it was used in 10 second sample periods at about @xmath17   hz . the light was filtered to produce a low - intensity beam ( @xmath181 photoelectron per pulse ) .",
    "the light was directed through an optical cable to face the tank from a distance of approximately 3  meters .",
    "the light from this source makes a cone with half - angle about 23@xmath19 , with greatest intensity along the centerline .",
    "the 3  m distance is great enough that one can assume that the entire face of the tube is uniformly illuminated with light in parallel rays .",
    "the signals from the tube in the testing tank can be read out via an oscilloscope / gpib card , or via the miniboone data acquisition system . for the angular tests ,",
    "a specialized data aquisition system was used ( fig .",
    "[ mmboone daq schematic ] ) .",
    "the signal from the tube in the tank is amplified by a factor of 100 , sent to a discriminator with 30 mv threshold , and finally put into coincidence with the delayed sync out signal from the led pulser .",
    "the number of coincidences and the number of input light pulses each go to a scaler ; they are then recorded and used to calculate the relative efficiency .",
    "the tank is magnetically shielded with a @xmath12-metal box .",
    "this was done because ambient magnetic fields ( e.g. , the earth s ) can influence the relative efficiency of the tubes , and thus rotation within these fields may change the shape of the relative efficiency results . to see if ambient magnetic fields could have a significant effect , the tank was rotated ( while holding the configuration of the tube and internal light source constant ) .",
    "the resulting effect was smaller than ( but on the same order as ) the angular dependence . when the tank was shielded and the same tests were performed , this dependence on orientation within ambient fields was not seen .",
    "the apparatus detailed above was used to study relative efficiency ( @xmath20 ) as a function of angle .",
    "using rapid , short - duration pulses of the led , the @xmath20 of the tube was measured at a given position by taking the ratio of the number of responses which coincided with led pulses to the total number of pulses , with about @xmath3 pulses per datum . @xmath21",
    "@xmath20 values were measured at @xmath22 increments through the entire @xmath23 of response , with two repetitions at each point and two rotations of the tube ( from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and back again ) for a total of four measurements at each tube position .",
    "data were recorded directly into a spreadsheet , providing an ongoing real - time check .",
    "this rotational test was performed on four r1408 and three r5912 tubes .",
    "most of these tubes had been previously tested with the global testing ( see section [ sec : global testing ] ) , so the expected dark rate was known , and known to be comparable to that for the other tubes .",
    "the global testing results also specified tube operating voltages .",
    "it was necessary to dark adapt each tube for at least 12 hours to obtain a dark rate comparable to that of the tubes in the detector , which have not been exposed to bright light for over three years .",
    "[ pgh : roll does nt matter ] the phototubes are essentially rotationally symmetric about their central vertical axis , with variation only in the dynode structure below the main dome .",
    "the r1408 tubes have `` venetian blind '' style dynodes ; the r5912 tubes have  box and line \" style dynodes .",
    "no significant differences were observed when the dynodes at the starting position were oriented horizontally , vertically , or at @xmath26 .",
    "additionally , a test was performed on one tube varying the yaw angle ( similar to the pitch measurements performed on all tubes ) ; again no significant differences were observed .",
    "the equivalence of pitch and yaw implies that that the roll orientation of the tube does not affect the results .",
    "this simplified the measurements greatly .",
    "another test was performed by varying the operating voltages by 50  v above and below the nominal voltages found by previous miniboone tests . the gain variation with voltage , which determines the @xmath27 ,",
    "was already known , so this test checked for variation in the shape of the @xmath20 curve more than the expected variations in amplitude .",
    "none of significance was observed .",
    "plots of relative efficiency as a function of angle were made for each set of measurements ; these are roughly bell - shaped , as one would expect from the shape of the tubes .",

    "thus , to describe the error , it is more important to look at the relatively large differences between data sets from different tubes .",

    "the present data are also observed to be closer to the geometrical model from the hamamatsu ovoid shape description than to the results obtained in either air or water by sno .",

    "the tank was being refilled following some maintenance work , and was approximately @xmath37 filled with water .",
    "the failure began with the implosion of a single tube on the detector floor ; the reason for this failure is not known .",
    "this set off a chain reaction which ultimately destroyed most of the tubes more than 5  m below the water line .",
    "all tubes within 5  m of the surface survived .",

    "the detector is filled with oil , which is a factor of 0.9 less dense than water .",
    "the static pressure at the bottom of the miniboone tank is 208 kpa ( 4.5 atm ) .",
    "each of these factors suggests that the miniboone detector should be more resistant to a chain reaction of implosions than was the super - k detector .",
    "a computational model to calculate the shock wave pressure resulting from tube implosion was developed , based upon the stored energy in an evacuated tube at a given depth , assuming the pulse length is the tube radius .",
    "it should be noted that the energy stored in an 8 inch miniboone tube is over an order of magnitude less than in a 20 inch super - k tube .    the pressure on a neighboring tube when a tube at the bottom of the miniboone detector implodes was compared to the pressure resulting from a super - k implosion at a depth of 5 m , the depth above which all super - k tubes survived .",
    "it was found the pressure in miniboone was 0.45 times the super - k pressure at survival depth , thus indicating a safety factor of two for miniboone if the tubes were equally strong .",
    "in fact , the 8 inch tubes are rated for a higher pressure than the 20 inch tubes .",
    "miniboone is therefore confident that the experiment is operating with a safety factor of greater than two , and that an accidental implosion of one of miniboone s tubes will not result in a chain reaction .",
    "a more rigorous hydrodynamic calculation was done using numerical techniques . from these calculations a somewhat greater safety factor of 2.6 can be inferred .",
    "after the super - k accident , several tests were done at super - k using the 20 inch tubes . personal communication from several super - k collaborators",
    "indicate that at a depth of 30 m of water chain reaction implosions occurred , but at 15 m there were no chain reactions .",
    "since the pressure at 15 m is significantly greater than the maximum pressure in miniboone this supports the conclusion that miniboone tubes are not at risk for this sort of accident .    in 1990 , the sno collaboration also performed a series of tests of 8 inch pmts in a water - filled pressure vessel .",
    "no chain reactions occurred at a pressure of 608 kpa ( 6 atm ) .",

    "<S> the detector for the miniboone  @xcite experiment at the fermi national accelerator laboratory employs 1520 8 inch hamamatsu models r1408 and r5912 photomultiplier tubes with custom - designed bases . </S>",
    "<S> tests were performed to determine the dark rate , charge and timing resolutions , double - pulsing rate , and desired operating voltage for each tube , so that the tubes could be sorted for optimal placement in the detector . </S>",
    "<S> seven phototubes were tested to find the angular dependence of their response . </S>",
    "<S> after the super - k phototube implosion accident , an analysis was performed to determine the risk of a similar accident with miniboone .    </S>",
