    "perhaps the most useful approximation in science is the description of microscopic , stochastic processes via `` mean field '' deterministic equations . except for the most fundamental parts of particle physics , almost any other study involves that procedure : classical mechanics",
    "is used to describe quantum systems , classical electromagnetism neglects the fluctuations of the photon density and continuum mechanics averages out the microscopic stochasticity involved in the motion of an individual molecule .",
    "chemical reaction kinetics is generally described by rate equations ; population dynamics and other ecological processes are depicted using the concept of logistic growth , or by lotka - volterra equations .",
    "the dynamics of the individual , microscopic , constituents is always stochastic , and is subject to fluctuations ; these fluctuations are smeared out when the system is described by deterministic rate equations .    basically , the underlying assumption beyond all these approximations is that the microscopic fluctuations are averaged out in the `` large density '' ( many atoms , animals , quanta ) limit . a generic analysis of the deterministic limit , like a @xmath1 expansion where @xmath0 is the number of elements , is still lacking in many fields .",
    "problems like the quantum classical correspondence in chaotic systems , or the decay of a quasistationary state to an absorbing state are still a subject of intensive studies .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated when spatially extended systems , made of diffusively coupled patches , are considered .",
    "what exactly determine the `` large n '' limit in that system ?",
    "should the number of microscopic entities be large on a single patch , or within a correlation length ?",
    "all these questions are still open , as no systematic perturbation theory in @xmath1 exists so far .",
    "in this paper we consider a generic process in population dynamics : the extinction transition with an absorbing state .",
    "the framework used is two well - known models for epidemics , namely , the sis and the sir models @xcite .",
    "for a well mixed population of size @xmath0 ( say , on a single patch ) the stochastic process starts by the introduction of a single infected ( `` i '' ) individual into the system .",
    "this individual may infect any other , susceptible ( `` s '' ) , individual with rate @xmath2 , where after the infection the susceptible becomes infected and may infect other susceptible members of the community ; the only other process is a `` recovery '' of an infected person ; this happens with rate @xmath3 . in the sir model ,",
    "the recovered individuals are then immune against the disease , while the sis model describes the case where the recovered became susceptible again .",
    "the elementary processes , thus , are @xmath4 denoting by @xmath5 the fraction of infected individuals , and by @xmath6 the fraction of susceptibles , the mean field equations in the well mixed limit are @xmath7 clearly , the sir process is self - limiting , as @xmath6 decreases with time , while the sis process may support an endemic state with @xmath8 .",
    "another piece of information garnered from the rate equations is the existence of a transition when the infectivity parameter @xmath9 crosses the value @xmath10 .",
    "below @xmath11 , both sis and sir processes immediately decay ; above that value , an outbreak is possible .",
    "the mean field equations ( [ eq2 ] ) are an approximation for the real stochastic process ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "some characteristics of the epidemic , though , may be calculated exactly for the real stochastic process in the well mixed limit .",
    "in particular ,      @xmath12 for large @xmath0 , above @xmath13 there are two peaks in the distribution of epidemic sizes .",
    "the first peak is at size 1 ( i.e. the initial infected individual , only ) .",
    "the second peak for the sir model is at the size predicted by the deterministic equations  @xcite .",
    "for the sis model , the second peak is at an exponentially large value , corresponding to the exponentially long lifetime of the metastable endemic state@xcite .        above @xmath13 , and for @xmath16 , the deterministic equations ( [ eq2 ] ) , with an appropriate contact term playing the role of `` diffusion '' , give rise to a constant velocity solution .",
    "the mean field dynamics is akin to that of the fkpp equation @xcite , and yield a velocity proportional to the square root of the distance from @xmath13 .",
    "the solution for the sis case is that of a front separating the metastable uninfected state ahead of the front from the endemic state behind . in the sir case ,",
    "the solution is a pulse , leaving behind a state with a diminished susceptible population such that the effective infectivity parameter , @xmath17 , is below @xmath13 .",
    "what happens in the stochastic models then ?",
    "let us discuss the sis case first . for @xmath18",
    "the sis model is equivalent to the contact process  @xcite , where there is a transition to a propagating state at a finite value of @xmath19 .",
    "this transition is known to be in the directed peculation ( dp ) equivalence class  @xcite . above the transition",
    ", there is a finite chance of generating a wave of infection whose lifetime is infinite . the average velocity of the wave is less than that predicted by the deterministic equation .",
    "this has been analyzed by brunet and derrida @xcite , who show that as @xmath20 , the average velocity approaches the deterministic value , albeit with anomalously large @xmath21 corrections .",
    "below the directed percolation transition , the typical spatial extent of the epidemic , denoted @xmath22 , is finite , and diverges as the transition point is approached . following the janssen - grassberger conjecture @xcite",
    ", it is widely believed that _ any _ generic extinction transition , and , in particular , the transition for the sis model for _ any _ n , falls in the equivalence class of directed percolation .    in order to test these predictions in the large density limit",
    "we have simulated the sis process on a one dimensional array of sites .",
    "on each site there are @xmath0 individuals , and this number is fixed throughout the process .",
    "the epidemics is ignited by the introduction of a single infected individual on a single site .",
    "the chance of an @xmath5 to infect any susceptible individual on the same site is @xmath23 , and its chance to infect an @xmath6 on one of the two neighboring sites is @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is the inter - site infectivity rate , while the population within a site is considered as well mixed .",
    "the chance of recovery is independent of the spatial structure and the recovery rate is @xmath3 for any individual .",
    "we have used an exact , agent - based simulation in order to study the approach to transition from below , using the divergence of the perpendicular correlation length @xmath22 as a marker of the transition .    what is the effect of increasing @xmath0 on the transition ? fixing @xmath3 and @xmath25 one should expect a dependence of @xmath26 , the value of @xmath27 at the dp transition , on @xmath0 . if @xmath18 , for example , the sis becomes a simple contact process on a line , and the dp transition happens when the infection rate is 3.297 times higher than the recovery rate ; accordingly , @xmath28 . on the other hand , as @xmath16 , @xmath26 should approach the value @xmath29 and becomes @xmath25 independent , as a single site may support the endemic state .",
    "@xmath26 should interpolate between these two limits as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "another effect has to do with the divergence of @xmath22 at the transition . according to the stochastic theory , right below the transition @xmath22 is finite but large . on the other hand ,",
    "the classical equations predict that @xmath30 below the transition .",
    "one expects both statements to be true at the large @xmath0 limit . the only way out of that paradox is to understand that the classical description must fail close enough to the transition , but the region in which it fails must shrink to zero in the @xmath31 limit .",
    "say it another way , at a fixed distance from the transition , and for large enough @xmath0 , the perpendicular correlation length should approach zero .",
    "our simulations support all parts of this picture .",
    "first , the jansen - grassberger conjecture works and in all cases studied we find that @xmath22 diverges as the transition point is approached from below with the expected power @xmath32 .",
    "second , we find that @xmath22 obeys a universal scaling with @xmath0 , independent of the details of the model .",
    "specifically , near the transition @xmath33 where for large @xmath0 @xmath34 where for large @xmath0 @xmath35 the data supporting these findings are presented in fig .",
    "[ rdp ] for the specific case of an sis model with fixed recovery time and @xmath36 .",
    "the applicability of these results , though , is much wider ; the same exponents turn out to describe the large @xmath0 limit of the sis model with different @xmath25 and with exponentially distributed recovery time , as well as other stochastic models like branching - annihilation - death ( @xmath37 ) and so on .",
    "we thus conjecture that these exponents describe the large @xmath0 behavior of _ any _ one - dimensional extinction transition that belongs to the dp equivalence class .",
    "the data collapse presented in figure [ sisxicol ] reveals the existence of much stronger regularity at large @xmath0 s .",
    "( [ trans ] ) implies that @xmath38 is a linear function of @xmath39 close to the transition .",
    "in fact , this result generalizes to a whole scaling regime where the scaled correlation length is a function of the scaled distance from the classical transition : @xmath40 again , we have verified that this scaling behavior is independent of the ( nonzero ) strength of the intersite coupling .",
    "we now turn to examine the behavior of the stochastic @xmath41 model at large @xmath0 . here",
    ", the model is supposed to be in the dynamic percolation universality class  @xcite .",
    "this class does not have a transition in one spatial dimension , and the propagating pulse always dies out in an infinite system .",
    "still , the correlation length exhibits a scaling behavior with @xmath0 very similar to that of the sis model .",
    "we find that the scaled correlation length , @xmath42 is a function of the scaled infectivity @xmath43 . the data collapse is presented in fig . [ sirxicol ]",
    "here the correlation length is finite for all infectivities , indicating that we are indeed below the percolation transition .",
    "the correlation length does however grow very rapidly with @xmath44 .    in the simulations presented above , we have used as our measure of the correlation length the inverse of the exponential falloff rate of the distribution function for infection location .",
    "it is remarkable that in both models , for all @xmath44 studied ( below the extinction transition ) , this distribution function appears to be given _",
    "exactly _ ( at least to within our statistical errors , over some seven decades ) by the functional form @xmath45 , with @xmath46 is the location of the original infected person .",
    "the average _ total _ number of infections is given then roughly by @xmath47 ( assuming @xmath48 , as it is for @xmath0 large ) .",
    "we can then deduce the scaling properties of @xmath49 with @xmath0 .",
    "the number of infections at the central site , @xmath50 are the result of the on - site infections nucleated by the original infected person and by those nucleated by the neighboring sites .",
    "the effective on - site infection rate is @xmath51 , and since this is below @xmath52 , each initial infection develops essentially independently , giving rise to @xmath53 total infections .",
    "the number of primary infections induced by the neighbors is @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we have , for @xmath55 @xmath56 this implies that @xmath57 so @xmath50 scales exactly the same with @xmath0 as @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the total number of infections scales as @xmath59 , in both the sis and sir models . for the sis model ,",
    "this gives the total number of infections scaling as @xmath60 , whereas in the sir model , we have the total number of infections scaling as approximately @xmath61 . notice that in both cases , the total number of infections at the critical infectivity scales faster than the 0 dimensional results , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "we have tested these predictions in our simulations , ( data not shown ) and found them to be very well satisfied . also , preliminary work indicates that these exponents are higher still in two dimensions , and saturate at 1 as the dimension goes to infinity  @xcite .    in the sis model , as in the related contact process , the total number of infections diverges at the directed percolation transition , with the exponent @xmath64 . however , the total number of infections is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "thus , @xmath66 should diverge at the transition as @xmath67 .",
    "combining this with our above result for the scaling of @xmath66 with @xmath0 at criticality , we get that @xmath68 where @xmath69 vanishes linearly at the transition .",
    "it is remarkable that even though the directed percolation exponent associated with @xmath66 differs from that of @xmath22 , the @xmath0 scaling is the same .",
    "our simulations suggest that the quasi - deterministic region is controlled by the new critical exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 . at the transition",
    ", the deterministic limit does not exist and the stochastic dynamics of the microscopic constituents determines the system behavior for any time scale . off transition , on the other hand , the effect of stochasticity vanishes for large enough @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 and @xmath71 is parameter independent , as long as the dimensionality of the system and the type of stochastic transition ( dp vs. dynamic percolation ) are kept fixed .",
    "it is interesting to point out an exception to our analysis , namely , the branching - annihilation process with no bare death term ( @xmath72 ) for brownian particles . here at low densities there is a dp type transition at finite birth rate , but as @xmath16 ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) the transition approaches @xmath74 .",
    "the deterministic limit of the transition in that case does _ not _ belong to the directed percolation equivalence class ; in fact , it is known that for @xmath74 the density decays like @xmath75 in one spatial dimension .",
    "indeed , cardy and tauber  @xcite calculated that the distance to the dp transition should scale as @xmath76 , ( since close to the classical transition the density is inversly proportional to @xmath1 ) .",
    "addition of a spontaneous death process @xmath77 to the model shifts the deterministic transition to @xmath78 and provide us with a model that admits a dp transition all the way to @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , our preliminary numerics show that in the cardy - tauber case the scaling of the critical @xmath80 appears to be consistent with their prediction . adding @xmath81 changes the picture dramatically and @xmath82 , where @xmath70 is identical to that measured for the sis model .",
    "it is interesting to note that , if the cardy - tauber perturbative technique is modified to include the spontaneous death process , at large @xmath0 the distance from the dp transition is predicted to scale as @xmath83 instead of @xmath76 .",
    "many aspects of that problem are still open .",
    "in particular a rigorous classification scheme for the quasi - deterministic behavior is still missing . the extinction transition in higher dimensions ( where dynamic percolation admits a nontrivial critical point ) and the behavior of the system above the transition also need to be investigated .",
