    "condensation phenomena have been widely observed in various stochastic processes and physical contexts , such as mass transport models @xcite , traffic flow @xcite , condensation of edges in complex networks @xcite .",
    "it is notable that some of the condensation phenomena occur in nonequilibrium systems , such as asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) and zero - range process ( zrp ) @xcite . in general , it is difficult to study such nonequilibrium systems , but the steady state properties in a class of the stochastic processes can be treated analytically because their partition functions are written in simple factorized forms .",
    "such a simple form of the partition function enables us to study the condensation phenomenon analytically .",
    "mass transport models , such as the zrp and urn models @xcite , have been widely used in order to research characteristic features of the condensation phenomena .",
    "when the condensation arises , a single site contains a macroscopic number of particles .",
    "both the zrp and urn models consist of many sites containing an integer number of particles .",
    "inter - particle interactions are modeled by allowing the particle transition rate to depend on the number of particles in each site . furthermore , in order to discuss general situations , it is possible to consider the case in which the transition rate depends also on a site - dependent disorder parameter .",
    "the mathematical structures for the zrp and the urn models are almost the same , so that one can treat these models in a similar manner .    in the urn models , there are two types of statistics @xcite : one is the ehrenfest class in which particles in a site are distinguishable ; the other is the monkey class which consists of indistinguishable particles",
    ". it has been revealed that the ehrenfest class corresponds to the statistical mechanics with the maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "monkey class is related to the bose - einstein statistics , and in general raises real - space condensation phenomena @xcite .",
    "the real - space condensation phenomenon means that a site has a macroscopic number of particles .",
    "we here note that some of recent researches on complex networks have dealt with distinguishable components @xcite , and a type of condensation phenomena has been observed numerically in a network model in the canonical ensemble , in which the total number of nodes and edges do not change @xcite .",
    "when we map a complex network to an urn model , the distinguishable property of edges in the network model corresponds to that of particles in the urn model @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that the condensation phenomenon is able to occur even in the ehrenfest class ( maxwell - boltzmann statistics ) due to the occurrence of the condensation phenomenon in the complex networks . actually , there are a few example of the ehrenfest class , in which the real - space condensation phenomenon can arise @xcite . however , in the complex networks , quenched disorder in the model is expected to be important , and discussion between the quenched disorder and the condensation phenomenon in the ehrenfest class has not been given yet .    in the present paper , we consider stochastic processes with the maxwell - boltzmann statistics , i.e. , the ehrenfest class , and with the quenched disorder .",

    ". finally , we get the following occupation distribution @xmath41    for the condensation phenomenon , the radius of convergence @xmath42 in eq .   plays an important role .",
    "we here define the radius of convergence as @xmath43 . in eq .",
    ", increasing the value of @xmath44 corresponds to the increase of the density @xmath45 .",
    "the radius of convergence @xmath46 gives the maximal value of the density @xmath47 : @xmath48 when the density @xmath3 goes beyond the critical density @xmath47 , the excess particles condense only on a site .",
    "it has been revealed that the following conditions are needed for the condensation phenomenon @xcite :    * if the radius of convergence @xmath49 is infinite , the condensation phenomena do not occur . *",
    "if the radius of convergence @xmath49 is finite and @xmath47 is infinite , one can find a solution of eq .",
    "for any finite density , so that there is no condensation phenomena .",
    "* if both @xmath49 and @xmath47 are finite , one can no longer satisfy eq .   for @xmath50 .",
    "in this case , we have condensation phenomena .",
    "it is obvious that the condensation phenomenon is difficult to occur in the ehrenfest class , because the factor @xmath51 makes the summation of eq .",

    "hence , the choice of the transition probability ( or @xmath52 ) would be important for the condensation phenomenon .",
    "in spite of the difficulty of occurrence of the condensation phenomenon in the ehrenfest class with quenched disorder , it is possible to construct a model for the condensation phenomenon . in order to research the condensation phenomenon in more detail , we consider a more concrete example , i.e. , the disordered preferential urn model on a complete graph proposed in ref .",

    "we here study the case with no disorder : all disorder parameters are @xmath58 . since the function @xmath59 of eq",
    ".   diverges with @xmath60 and @xmath56 , we have to check the critical density .",
    "when @xmath60 , the saddle point equation gives @xmath61 this means that the critical density @xmath47 in infinite .",

    "it has been revealed that the sites with the disorder parameter @xmath64 are important for the condensation phenomenon in the preferential urn model , but the non - disordered case is not sufficient for the occurrence of the condensation .",

    "next , we check the case with @xmath73 @xcite . in this disordered case , we get the critical density @xmath74 , so that we have the condensation phenomenon in this disordered case",
    ". we shall call the condensation as ` genuine condensation ' , and distinguish it from the complete condensation and pseudo - condensation explained later .    the occupation distribution in the steady state",
    "is obtained by eq .  .",

    "we note that the occupation distribution obtained analytically can not represent a condensed site ; the occupation distribution is adequate except for the condensed site .",

    "we have performed numerical experiments for the disordered urn model on a complete graph with lattice size @xmath78 .",
    "all results are obtained by averaging @xmath79 realizations .",
    "it is notable that the condensation arises only in the case in which there is at least one site with @xmath64 , as discussed in sec .",

    ", a site with the disorder parameter @xmath64 is difficult to emerge because we here treat a finite - size system .",
    "the value of @xmath5 near @xmath19 is not sufficient to occur the condensation phenomenon , as discussed later .",

    "[ fig_distribution ] , we can see that there are several points which deviate from the analytical result ( solid line ) because we take the average over @xmath79 simulations .",
    "we here note that in each simulation , there is only one point which deviates from the analytical result .",
    "the deviating point means the fact that one site has quite a lot of particles in each simulation , which indicates the occurrence of the condensation phenomenon .",
    "note that due to fluctuation among each simulation , the largest value of @xmath20 in each simulation is different from each other , and hence we do not have a peak but the flat tail .",
    "we also see the condensation phenomenon by comparing with the case of @xmath84 and @xmath85 ; the maximum value of @xmath20 increases in the case of @xmath85 compared with that of @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ fig_distribution ] . however , the shapes of the distribution in small @xmath20 region are the same in both cases .",
    "the analytical treatment suggests that the occupation distribution does not vary except for the condensed site in the condensed phase .",
    "hence , we confirm the occurrence of the condensation from the unchangeability of the occupation distribution in small @xmath20 region and the shift to the right of the deviating points in the large @xmath20 region .        in order to see the condensation phenomenon more clearly",
    ", we have calculated the number of particles in the site which contains the maximum number of particles .",
