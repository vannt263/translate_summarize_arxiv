    "the field is part of the hamburg quasar survey ( hagen et al .",

    "is located in the outer part of a pointing on the abell cluster a851 .",
    "all observations were made with the pspc detector ( pfeffermann et al .",
    "1986 ) on board the rosat satellite ( trmper 1983 ) , between april 1991 and october 1993 .",
    "each pointing was split into at least two observational intervals ( obis ) separated by intervals ranging from a few hours to more than a year .",

    "the entrance window of the pspc is covered by a thin foil supported by aluminum struts ( pfeffermann et al .",
    "depending on its position in the field of view ( fov ) , these struts can shadow a source .",
    "rosat is operated in the so  called ` wobble mode ' to lessen the imprints of the struts . as a consequence ,",
    "sources close to the detector edge can be moved ( partly ) out of the fov .",

    "was detected only in the second obi , but not in the first , although it is unobscured in both .",
    "we determined the vignetting corrected number of counts between 0.1 and 1.0kev in the source area of the first obi , @xmath15 , and use the count rate @xmath16 as an upper limit in the following .",

    "a single power law with cold absorption gives an unacceptable fit when n@xmath17 is fixed at the galactic value .",
    "with n@xmath17 free , the value obtained for the column density is more than twice the galactic value .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung with fixed galactic absorption yields a rather poor fit with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . treating  as a free parameter improves the fit , but again results in @xmath20 .",
    "an absorbed blackbody model gives acceptable fits for n@xmath17 both fixed and free .",
    "the galactic n@xmath17 is higher than the best fit value , but still within the @xmath21 confidence interval .",

    "a single power law fits the data , but again the fitted n@xmath17 is more than twice the galactic value .",
    "we then tried a two  component fit of the total rosat band with galactic absorption , the soft component modeled by a blackbody and the hard by a power law .",
    "it might be thought that the hard component is mainly a result of contamination by rxj0947.1 + 4721  which is at least partly inside the extraction area of rxj0947.0 + 4721 . to check this , we fixed power law index and flux at the values estimated for that source .",
    "the fit gives unacceptable results by underestimating the high energy tail of the spectrum , thus hinting at a noticeable hard component of rxj0947.0 + 4721  itself .",
    "we decided to fix the power law index at the canonical value @xmath2 and fit only the two normalizations and the blackbody temperature because the statistics above 1kev are too poor to fit @xmath22 as well .",
    "only @xmath23 of the source photons are detected above 1kev , and if these are filled into more than one spectral bin , the relative error per bin is above 25% , too high to give reasonable constraints on @xmath22 .",
    "the fit result is presented in fig .",

    "the contribution of rxj0947.1 + 4721  to the overall averaged flux will be about @xmath26 at worst ( section [ xdatq38 ] ) .",
    "with h@xmath27 and q@xmath27 as before , the fitted flux corresponds to a good ( overall ) average luminosity l@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) in the qso s rest frame ( 0.15  3.70 kev ) .",
    "the detected maximum and minimum luminosities , in this model , are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and the upper limit corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "we applied no k  correction to avoid including parts of the spectrum which we did not observe , and to avoid a shift of the band onto the rayleigh ",
    "jeans part of the blackbody component of the spectrum .",
    "the values for f@xmath33 and l@xmath33 have to be taken with caution , because they are strongly model dependent .",
    "so far , no indication for spectral variability could be found . as a further test",
    ", we created ` high count rate ' and ` low count rate ' spectra which were binned as described before , and then divided ( fig .",
    "[ dhl ] ) .",
    "the separating count rate , @xmath34 , was chosen to give roughly the same number of counts in both spectra .",
    "spectral changes should be visible as a deviation of the ratio from a constant .",

    "the data are consistent with a constant value ( @xmath35 13d.o.f . ;",
    "@xmath36 ) . if all data are used , or if a different binning is applied , the results are similar .",

    "this latter observation may be taken as an indication that the steepness extends towards fairly high rest frame energies .",
    "however , the indication must not be overstressed .",
    "the value of @xmath22 for e1346@xmath11266 is not well determined ; puchnarewicz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find smaller values ( @xmath68 ) than boller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "a better description of the observed spectrum can be achieved by thermal models , however , both the blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung models underestimate the flux above 1kev .",
    "the analysis in section [ xdatq38 ] has shown that the hard component of the spectrum can not be totally explained with the neighbouring harder source which is too weak .",
    "it must therefore be intrinsic to rxj0947.0 + 4721 .",
    "a good fit is obtained with a blackbody modeling the soft excess plus a power law as hard component , modified by galactic absorption . for an accretion disk model",
    "this means that the x ",
    "rays originate from a small region with little variations in temperature .",
    "this interpretation assumes a thermal origin for the x  ray emission in the inner parts of the accretion disk .",
    "there is , however , an indication against this assumption .",
    "no change of the hardness ratio with increasing count rate is observed , which means that the temperature of the emitting region remains constant over nearly one order of magnitude in luminosity . over this luminosity range temperature variations",
    "should be easily detectable from the correlation @xmath69 .",
    "model calculations for a spectrum with fixed power law component , and all flux changes attributed to a temperature change in the blackbody component , show that only small deviations from the average flux @xmath70 ( table [ xspec ] , last row ) would be compatible with the data .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ spmod ] , which shows the ratio of high to low count rate spectra for the data ( crosses with error bars ) and six simulations ( lines ) with ratios @xmath71 between 0.4 and 2 .",
    "the curves for ratios 2 , 1.75 , and 0.4 , show significant deviations from the observed ratio , while the others agree with the data below channel 100 ( roughly 1kev ) .",
    "only changes less than a factor 1.75  2 can be caused by a change in t. the large changes observed ( factors 5.7 , 2.7 ) must be caused by another process .",
    "a luminosity change in dependency of the radius ( pulsations with constant temperature , @xmath72 ) is difficult to model for an accreting black hole because the x  ray emitting region should have always the same distance ( in schwarzschild radii ) from the central engine . as a consequence",
    ", models involving reprocessing of harder x  ray into softer photons could be a solution .",
    "in guilbert & rees ( @xcite ) , the central engine produces a non  thermal spectrum of hard x  rays and @xmath73rays of sufficient energy to produce electron ",
    "positron pairs which in turn can produce and maintain a secondary @xmath74 plasma with optical depth @xmath75 .",
    "the large optical depth is responsible for the existence of a cool component in the gas close to the central engine .",
    "incident radiation is reflected and reprocessed by cold material .",
    "more recent works ( e.g. maraschi & haardt 1997 , haardt et al .",
    "1997 ) have shown that the disk corona may have only electrons instead of @xmath76 pairs , and that it is not necessarily optically thick .",
    "the fact that the iron @xmath77 line is not comptonized to invisibility supports @xmath78 for the corona .",
    "however , although these models can explain the shape of the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum , the lack of spectral variations may cause problems . in haardt",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , noticeable spectral changes are predicted for the rosat band , none of which are observed for rxj0947.0 + 4721 .",
    "models including warm absorbers may be another possible explanation of nls1 phenomena .",
    "a detailed description of such a model applied to mrk766 can be found in leighly et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . unfortunately , mrk766 is more a sy1.5 than a nls1 ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) , and it may be inappropriate to generalize the results for this special object to the whole nls1 class .",
    "the application of such a model to rxj0947.0 + 4721  would conflict with the lack of spectral variability , anyway .",
    "changes of ionisation parameter and/or column density of the warm absorber would cause changes in spectral shape .",
    "spectral changes are expected even if the variations arise via changes in the central source itself since photoionisation contributes to the ionisation structure of the absorber .",
    "the lack of spectral changes for rxj0947.0 + 4721  is a strong argument against warm absorber models .",
    "further model constraints can in principle be derived from timing analysis .",
    "the shortest variation significantly detected for rxj0947.0 + 4721  corresponds to a decrease @xmath79 ( bb + pl model ) in @xmath80 .",
    "following fabian & rees ( 1979 ) , this value implies an efficiency @xmath81  far below the limit of 0.057 for accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "if the single power law model is used instead , we have @xmath82 , and subsequently @xmath83 , still more than a factor 4 below the limit .    blazar",
    " like activity , known to produce rapid x ",
    "ray variations , is usually not applied to nls1 galaxies because nls1 objects do not show properties which are typical for jet activities , as there are flat spectrum radio emission , strong polarisation , and nearly featureless multifrequency spectra .",
    "rxj0947.0 + 4721  may be different in that the possibility of a flat radio spectrum ( i.e. @xmath84 , which would make it also radio loud ) can presently not be ruled out .    if the short time variations are confirmed , a schwarzschild black hole will no longer be a proper model .",
    "the schwarzschild limit is passed if large amplitude variations ( @xmath85 ) in 16000s are detected .",
    "these would suggest either the presence of a kerr black hole or relativistic x  ray beaming effects .",
    "the large amplitude variation of a factor @xmath5 hints at models like a filamentary or spot  like emission region ( iras13224@xmath123809 ; otani et al .",
    "1996 ) or tidal disruption of stars ( ic3599 ; brandt et al .",
    "1995 , grupe et al .",
    "1995 ) which have been suggested to explain giant amplitude variations in these ultrasoft nls1 galaxies .",
    "this paper presents optical and soft x  ray observations of a qso discovered within the rass and present in 16 pointings from a medium deep rosat survey in the field hs 47.5/22  ( molthagen et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the object is similar to narrow  line seyfert 1 galaxies , but both its optical and x  ray luminosity are about an order of magnitude higher than most of the objects in boller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , thus clearly extending the object class into the quasar domain .",
    "it shows an extremely soft x  ray spectrum .",
    "the usual description with a power law and low energy absorption gives only very poor fits .",
    "single component thermal models underestimate the flux above 1kev . a two component model with the soft excess modeled by a blackbody , and a power law as hard component ,",
    "gives a better fit .",
    "strong and  at the high luminosity  remarkably fast variations can be seen in the light curve of rxj0947.0 + 4721 .",
    "warm absorbers could be an explanation of nls1 phenomena . applied to rxj0947.0 + 4721 , such models conflict with the lack of observed spectral variability .",
    "however , the faintness of rxj0947.0 + 4721  at harder x  rays may have prohibited the detection of changes close to 1kev .      at present , the hard x  ray data are not sufficient to distinguish between the above models , or others like a filamentary or spot  like emission region , or the tidal disruption of stars . a thorough investigation of intensity _ and",
