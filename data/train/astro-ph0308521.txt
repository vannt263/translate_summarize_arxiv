    "we also wish to use the ensemble of such objects to characterize forming clusters and associations ; their initial mass functions and star formation histories . to meet these goals , we need to determine parameters of the stars and relate them to other properties of protostellar disks and of the surrounding cloud .",

    "the near  ir spectra of late  type stars contain useful information about the luminosities of the targets .",

    "they argue that using line ratios , rather than equivalent widths , makes the t@xmath12 determination less sensitive to the presence of continuum excesses in pms objects .",
    "while most of the efforts to derive spectral types from the ir spectra have focused on empirical equivalent width or line ratio to t@xmath1 relations , there have also been a number of efforts to match low resolution h and k  band spectra to synthetic spectra @xcite .",

    "resolving powers , not only can the depths of the lines get quite small , especially in the presence of excess continuum emission but there can also be problems due to line blending .",
    "for example , many of these studies use the equivalent width of the na features at 2.2  @xmath4 m in the determination of spectral type and luminosity class . at @xmath14 , the typical resolving power for the studies , however , the na lines are blended with weaker but significant lines of sc and si that have very different dependences on t@xmath1 and @xmath6 . existing spectra of the na interval at a greater resolving power",
    "have shown that the relative strengths of the sc , si , and na lines plus the shape of the na features could potentially be sensitive indicators of effective temperature for dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we present here a technique for deriving some of the properties of pms stars from high resolution near  ir spectra .",
    "high resolution spectra are particularly useful because the closely spaced lines ( like the na , sc , and si features at 2.206 @xmath4 m , see figures [ fig-lambda.intervals ] & [ fig-na.behavior ] ) in late ",

    "the method is largely independent of photometric data ( except as used to cross  calibrate high resolution spectral segments at different wavelengths and to estimate the small amount of reddening difference between 2.2 @xmath4 m and 2.3@xmath4 m , see appendix a ) and offers the promise of improved accuracy , especially for derivations of the properties of heavily obscured stars .    in this paper",

    "observations with both instruments were made by nodding the telescope , placing the target star alternately at two different positions along the slit .",
    "iraf was used to reduce the spectra from both spectrometers in roughly same way ( for details about the nirspec data reduction see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the phoenix data",
    ", we differenced the source frames taken at alternate slit positions and divided by flat fields using an internal continuum lamp that uniformly illuminated the entire slit . at locations of bad pixels",

    "we used telluric absorption lines of h@xmath23o and ch@xmath24 to wavelength calibrate the phoenix data .",
    "the best fit to the low order wavelength solution was accurate to 0.1 pixels along the detector array .",
    "we removed the telluric lines from the spectra by dividing the data by spectra of early  type stars taken at the same airmass ( typically within 5@xmath25 of the target ) .",
    "we produced the final spectra by taking a signal  weighted average of the calibrated spectra from the two beam positions . to prepare the final spectra for comparison with models",
    ", we set a continuum level by eye using regions in the observed spectra where synthesis models indicate that strong lines and extended line wings are not present .",
    "ideally , we would like to be able to derive stellar parameters across the whole range of masses and ages present in clusters or associations of newly forming stars .",
    "the actual range of surface gravities and effective temperatures for which we can derive parameters from high resolution spectroscopic observations using the technique we outline here is constrained in several ways : we are limited to objects that permit observable amounts of near  ir radiation from the stellar photosphere to escape through the surrounding disk and envelope . in general ,",
    "photometric studies of ysos imply that the lowest surface gravities for which objects become visible in the near  ir are @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "our technique requires that the stellar photospheres have a sufficient number of reasonably strong lines and that these lines be sensitive to variations in temperature and surface gravity .",
    "further , it requires that the stellar models and available line lists be adequate to permit us to make accurate high resolution spectral syntheses for comparison with the observed spectra . with the stellar atmospheres and synthesis program we are using",

    "the grid spans the relevant ranges of the important stellar parameters for ysos : effective temperature , surface gravity , veiling , and @xmath3 rotation .",
    "the best model fit is chosen by an rms minimization of the residuals across the photospheric absorption lines in our spectral window .",
    "this minimization also includes a fit for the stellar radial velocity .",
    "the 2.02.4  @xmath4 m atmospheric window contains features that are sensitive to both the temperature and pressure in the stellar photosphere .",
    "it is also the longest wavelength band where the photospheric emission from the youngest stars is comparable in flux to the thermal emission from dust in the circumstellar disk . at this wavelength ,",
    "the sensitivity of ground  based spectrometers with large resolving powers is not yet compromised by thermal emission from the telescope and sky .",
    "the 2 @xmath4 m band is also not far from the maximum in the photospheric emission from late  type stars .    for the purposes of our spectral matching program , high spectral resolution means sufficient resolution to permit us to resolve most stellar lines ( r  @xmath30  20,000 ) .",
    "no existing high resolution spectrometer covers the entire 2.02.4  @xmath4 m atmospheric window with a single exposure . the instrument with the most coverage ( nirspec , * ? ? ?",

    "in order to be generally applicable without enormous expenditure of telescope time , our technique should therefore use only a limited part of the spectrum available within the atmospheric window .",
    "we have used spectral synthesis models to explore the k window to find the spectral intervals that have strong lines that vary significantly with variations in the stellar parameters . based on this investigation , we chose the region at 2.2070  @xmath4 m @xmath130.0050 ( hereafter `` the na interval '' , see figure  [ fig-lambda.intervals]a ) which includes two strong neutral sodium lines ( 4s@xmath31s@xmath324p@xmath31p@xmath33 ) , and several prominent lines of neutral si and sc .",
    "we selected a second spectral region at 2.2960  @xmath4 m @xmath130.0035 where the dominant feature is the 20 bandhead of @xmath5co ( `` the @xmath5co interval '' , see figure  [ fig-lambda.intervals]b ) for our analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig-na.behavior ] presents a sequence of spectral syntheses for the na interval that illustrates the sensitivity of the line ratios and line shapes in this wavelength band to the photospheric temperature .",
    "we produced a grid of spectra covering the appropriate range in t@xmath1 and @xmath6 using the nextgen non  grey atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "these models include tio and h@xmath23o opacities , critical for cooler atmospheres .",

    "this value decreases as log  g increases , approaching a roughly constant value at log  g  @xmath35  3.5 .",
    "this asymptotic value of log  g decreases steadily from @xmath362.5 km s@xmath2 at spectral type a6 to @xmath361.3 km s@xmath2 at spectral type g1 , lending further support to the appropriateness of our use of the solar microturbulence value in our models of late  type stars with dwarf and sub  dwarf gravities .    at cool temperatures",
    "( i.e. t@xmath37 k ) , the wings of the two na  i lines are noticeably pressure broadened .",
    "the synthesis code , moog , allows for the van der waals damping parameter to be adjusted in creating the artificial spectra .",
    "we have tuned the amount of damping present in the na i lines to give the best fit to an observed spectrum of the sun @xcite .",
    "the best fit was the @xcite approximation used to calculate the van der waals damping constant .",
    "the strength of the na lines increases with increasing surface gravity at a fixed temperature , while co lines decrease in strength .",
    "a qualitative way to understand these trends is to examine how the increase in electron presssure drives where the lines and continuum form within the stellar atmosphere . the greater electron pressures at higher gravity results in a larger fractional abundance of neutral sodium , causing the 2.2 @xmath4 m lines to form closer to the stellar surface .",
    "this effect is larger than the decrease in the depth of continuum formation with increasing electron pressure resulting in larger line depths for na . in the case of co",
    ", the increase in the continuum opacity of h@xmath38 is the dominant effect and the continuum layer moves closer to the line forming region reducing the strength of the bandhead absorption .",
    "we also wish to derive the rotation rate ( @xmath3 ) , and the amount of `` veiling '' ( non  photospheric excess emission relative to the photospheric flux ) . at a given wavelength , for example that of the na interval , this veiling is defined as r@xmath39  ( f@xmath40f@xmath41f@xmath42 , where f@xmath43 and f@xmath42 are the observed flux and the photospheric flux , respectively . therefore , we added extra dimensions to the t@xmath12  @xmath6 grid of synthetic spectra to include variations in @xmath44 and r@xmath45 as well . to account for @xmath44 variations",
    ", we convolved the spectra with a rotational broadening profile that had an assumed limb darkening coefficient of 0.6 @xcite adding rotation at rates ranging from @xmath44 = 1 to 40 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the intensity of the non  photospheric emission over the individual narrow spectral intervals has at most a slope of a few percent , so we can treat it with a single parameter . in the presence of such an excess ,",
    "resolved lines have lower equivalent widths but retain the shapes imparted to them by line transfer in the stellar atmosphere and by rotation .",
    "we alter the synthetic spectra to include additional continuum to simulate veiling ( r@xmath45 ) ranging from 0 to 8 .",
    "while , in all cases , our technique involves precise matching of spectra synthesized from model atmospheres to high resolution observations of limited portions of stellar spectra in the near  ir , the exact procedure and which parameters we can derive depend on the nature of the target stars and on the data available .",
    "the interval around the 2.2 @xmath4 m sodium lines is particularly rich in diagnostic power . when observations of only this interval are available , we can determine both the size of any excess emission and the rotation velocity in pms stars , as well as a quite well constrained measure of the stellar effective temperature , all without recourse to stellar photometry that is sensitive to reddening and to the circumstellar excess .",
    "we discuss our analysis for stars where only the na interval has been observed in @xmath17  [ sec-na.alone ] .    with the addition of observations of the @xmath5co interval , it is possible to refine the t@xmath1 determination and to determine the surface gravity of the emitting star , even in the presence of significant veiling and reddening . in @xmath17  [ sec-na.and.co ] , we explain how these improvements come about . throughout the discussion ,",
    "our focus is on applying the technique to reddened young ttss ( djw03 ) .",
    "when using this method to characterize heavily reddened main sequence stars , only minor modifications ( such as dropping the free parameter for near  ir veiling ) are needed .",
    "we begin the spectral matching for the na interval by using pattern recognition to constrain the effective temperature to a 1000  k range . for ysos , we fix the value of @xmath463.5 , which corresponds to @xmath3612  myr old objects in stellar evolutionary models @xcite , consistent with age estimates of the central embedded cluster in ophiuchus that includes the sources studied in djw03 @xcite . in @xmath17  [ sec - errors ] below , we describe in detail how the choice of a particular value of @xmath6 affects the t@xmath1 determination and how to correct t@xmath12 should @xmath6 have a different value .",
    "once we have the grid of spectral syntheses in place , we need to choose spectral subintervals over which to compare the spectra synthesized from the atmosphere models to the observed spectra . based on our experience with both mk standards and ysos , we restrict the subintervals to the regions within the observed spectra where there is measurable line absorption .",
    "the upper and lower boundaries of the wavelength range vary with the apparent width of the stronger spectral features .",
    "the next step is to take the continuum normalized observed spectrum and compare it to each synthesized model spectrum calculating the rms difference over the subintervals chosen in the previous step .",
    "figure  [ fig-fits.withnoise ] illustrates the minimization by showing an artificial noisy spectrum and how the differences between this spectrum and the noiseless synthetic spectra vary as the search routine steps through the correct value of t@xmath1 .",
    "we then find the combination of t@xmath1 , r@xmath45 , and @xmath44 values that would produce the minimum rms difference between the model and the observed spectra by interpolation .",
    "we illustrate the minimization process in figure  [ fig - contours ] which shows the variation of the rms difference between an artificial noisy spectrum and various synthesis models of the na interval as a function of the search parameters .",
    "we show variations of @xmath6 even though we would normally fix this parameter at a best ",
    "guess value when only na interval data are available .",
    "the figure displays the rms difference and thereby the shape of the minimum in the t@xmath12@xmath3 plane , the t@xmath1r@xmath45 plane , and the t@xmath1@xmath6 plane as the two variables are varied while the other two variables are held fixed at their nominal values . in all three planes ,",
    "there are well  determined minima in the fits to the spectrum of the na interval for all variables except @xmath6 .",
    "the minimum in the t@xmath1@xmath6 plane is very shallow .",
    "it is the one plane where we do not usually recover the input model .",
    "the grid in the @xmath6 direction is fairly coarse ( @xmath47 ) and some noise seeds for the artificial spectrum at @xmath48 even find the lowest rms value at the edge of the grid ( @xmath49 ) , leaving the exact location of the minimum uncertain .",
    "this cut ( see bottom panel of figure  [ fig - contours ] ) illustrates that an incorrect guess of @xmath6 for real target spectra can lead to systematic errors in the derived value of t@xmath1 ( see @xmath17  [ sec - errors ] ) .",
    "there is a strong inverse dependence of the ( 20 )  @xmath5co bandhead equivalent width on @xmath6 .",
    "there is also a weaker but noticeable dependence of the line equivalent width for the na interval with @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig - isograv ] plots the ratio of ( 20 )  @xmath5co to na interval photospheric equivalent width ( the equivalent width summed over the lines within the interval after removal of any non  photospheric continuum from the spectrum ( see appendix a ) as a function of t@xmath1 for @xmath6 values ranging from 3.5 to 5.0 .",
    "we derived this ratio from the nextgen photospheric models by creating synthetic spectra for the relevant intervals and integrating the spectra over the bands marked in figure  [ fig-lambda.intervals ] . for t@xmath51 3700  k ,",
    "the ratio varies strongly with @xmath6 and is almost independent of temperature . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the ratio still varies strongly with @xmath6 but t@xmath1 must also be known to correct for the sensitivity of the equivalent width ratio to temperature .    in @xmath17  [ sec-na.alone ] , we derived t@xmath1 , @xmath3 , and r@xmath45 from spectra of the na interval while holding @xmath6 fixed . when we have data available for both the na and the @xmath5co intervals , we are able to solve for @xmath6 rather than just assume its value .",
    "we determine @xmath6 and the other parameters iteratively .",
    "we begin by assuming @xmath49 and derive a best fit for t@xmath12 , r@xmath45 , and @xmath3 using the na observations as in @xmath17  [ sec-na.alone ] .",
    "we take the values of t@xmath1 and r@xmath45 that this process produces and use them , together with the integrals over the spectral intervals shown in figure [ fig-lambda.intervals ] , to compute the ratio of photospheric equivalent widths in the @xmath5co and na intervals ( see appendix  a ) . with the photospheric equivalent width ratio and the derived value of t@xmath1 , we can use the relations plotted in figure  [ fig - isograv ] to estimate @xmath6 and use this new value of @xmath6 in an iteration of the procedure for deriving t@xmath12 , @xmath3 and r@xmath45 from the observed spectrum of the na interval .",
    "the iterative procedure converges quickly on a value for @xmath6 .",
    "the first two panels of figure  [ fig-loggteff.degen ] illustrate how the derivation of parameters from the na interval plus the use of the @xmath5co interval photospheric equivalent width work together to produce the correct value for all four parameters .",
    "the figure shows how the equivalent width of the co bandhead varies significantly more than the equivalent width of the na interval going from ( t@xmath1 , @xmath6 )  =  ( 3600 k , 3.5 ) to ( 4000 k , 4.5 ) .",
    "note that at low temperatures and high surface gravities , the na line wings extend beyond the spectral interval over which we compute the equivalent width for the na interval .",
    "when the data cover a similar or narrower spectral interval , observations of cool and/or high surface gravity stars must be corrected for the fact that the intensity at the edges of the band is not fully at the level of the photospheric continuum .",
    "we have applied this correction in figure  [ fig - isograv ] .",
    "therefore even when data with broader spectral coverage are available , the measured equivalent width should be computed only over the marked intervals in figure  [ fig-lambda.intervals ] for comparison to figure  [ fig - isograv ] .",
    "although our procedure for using the co interval together with the na interval to determine @xmath6 does not , in principle , require high spectral resolution observations of the co bandhead , such observations are very useful . in the youngest ysos , the excess non",
    " photospheric emission can be many times greater than the emission from the photosphere itself .",
    "in such cases , the equivalent widths of the lines not only fail to represent the conditions in the stellar atmosphere but also can be extremely hard to measure . in low resolution spectra ,",
    "the combination of dilution by non ",
    "photospheric emission and dilution because the features are unresolved can make reliable measures of equivalent widths very problematic .",
    "good atmospheric cancellation is also difficult because of the inherent messiness both of the stellar and the telluric spectrum in the region of the ( 20 )  @xmath5co bandhead .",
    "higher resolution spectra improve the situation because they make it easier to cancel telluric lines and because line  to  continuum ratios are larger .    at high resolution , where we can resolve the co bandhead and also the adjacent features in the ascending and descending r  branch and where effective telluric line cancellation is possible",
    ", we can match the depth and shape of a co bandhead to obtain useful information about both t@xmath1 and @xmath6 that does not depend strongly on precise determination of the continuum level .",
    "the third panel in figure  [ fig-loggteff.degen ] illustrates the dependence of the spectral shape in the ( 20 )  @xmath5co bandhead on @xmath6 and t@xmath1 as it would be seen at high spectral resolution .",
    "this panel demonstrates the potential for using detailed spectral shapes in the @xmath5co interval to improve the robustness of the stellar parameter derivation scheme .",
    "it shows the difference between the synthetic spectrum for the co interval for ( t@xmath1 , @xmath6)=(3800  k , 4.0 ) and ( 4000  k , 4.5 ) and ( 3600  k , 3.5 ) .",
    "we see that , in addition to the equivalent width changes , there is a change in the individual line depths and in the shape of the envelope of the bandhead at this resolving power ( r  @xmath52 ) . in the current work , however , we restrict ourselves to analyzing the results of detailed spectral synthesis matching for the na interval combined with use of the na/@xmath5co photospheric equivalent width ratio to arrive at accurate values for t@xmath1 , @xmath3 , r@xmath45 and @xmath50 .",
    "now that we have developed a procedure for determining stellar parameters from high resolution spectra , we would like to know how well it works , both the sensitivity of the fitting routine and the uniqueness of the derived solutions .",

    ". the sensitivity of the t@xmath1 , @xmath3 , and r@xmath45 determinations will be not only a function of the signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectra but also will depend on the widths of the lines and on their strengths relative to the continuum ( that is , effectively on all four parameters ) . by working with a typical spectrum , however",
    ", we can get a rough idea of what s / n we require to reach the point where random noise in the spectra no longer dominates the uncertainty in determining stellar parameters .",
    "we illustrate the sensitivity to random errors by taking a synthetic spectrum for the model shown in figure  [ fig-lambda.intervals]a and adding more and more gaussian random noise to it .",
    "we take each artificially noisy spectrum , find the best  fit values for t@xmath1 , @xmath3 and r@xmath45 in the usual way , by calculating the rms difference between this spectrum and a set of noise  free synthesis models covering a range in all three parameters and then interpolating to obtain the best  fit values . at each s / n level , we re  seed the noisy spectrum 30 times and repeat the fitting procedure . the standard deviation about the mean value of each derived parameter for this ensemble of noisy spectra",

    "the uncertainty in the t@xmath1 due to random errors is less than 100  k for s / n @xmath35 50 .",

    "once the s / n exceeds @xmath3635@xmath55(1+r@xmath45 ) , other forms of errors begin to dominate the uncertainty in the derivation of stellar parameters from the k  band spectral fitting technique .    for @xmath3",
    ", we also tested the dependence of the uncertainty on t@xmath1 .",
    "we used models with stellar rotation ( 25  km  s@xmath2 ) , instrumental smoothing ( r @xmath52 ) and gaussian noise ( s / n @xmath56 per r @xmath57 channel with r@xmath45=0 ) added to simulate real data .",
    "we fit the modified synthetic spectra to a set of noiseless models keeping the temperature fixed at the correct value and allowing the rms minimization algorithm to select the best @xmath3 value .",

    "simultaneously in a certain sense can keep the line shapes and depths almost unchanged .",
    "these partial degeneracies in the output line shapes between different groupings of stellar parameters can have the effect of exaggerating the uncertainties caused by random errors .",
    "for minimizations of model  observed spectral differences in the na interval , this effect is most evident in the broadness of the minimum rms error along a diagonal in the t@xmath58 plane ( figure  [ fig - contours ] , bottom ) .",

    ", we recover the actual value of t@xmath1 to within better than 4% .",
    "the way in which we create the error space from comparisons of observed target spectra and synthesized model spectra may have a systematic effect on the derived parameters . the error space shown in figure  [ fig - contours ] represents the rms deviation of the target spectrum from the models over selected intervals where line absorption was present ( see figure  [ fig-fits.withnoise ] ) .",
    "this scheme allows for variations of feature depths and shapes .",
    "because it is a straight rms , it weights the stronger features , in particular the na features , more heavily .",
    "one might ask if this is the best scheme , i.e. does it make the uncertainties in the derived parameters larger than they need to be ? in its favor is the ability of the na line depths to distinguish the value of r@xmath45 and the sensitivity of the depth and shape of these lines to t@xmath1 and @xmath6 . on the other side of the ledger",
    "is the low weight a straight rms gives to the weaker sc and si lines .",
    "the ratio of these lines is the most sensitive temperature indicator in the na interval .",
    "more complex schemes that make better use of the information content of the weaker lines and the subtleties of the line shapes are certainly possible . when the s / n gets large enough that systematic errors dominate over random errors , a straight rms does not do as well as a weighted error scheme , but remains a reasonable approximation . the simple rms scheme , however , has the great advantage that it finds the right parameters robustly over our whole temperature range at various values of r@xmath45 and @xmath3 and that its level of complexity is appropriate to s / n ratios of 3050 where random errors are just beginning to give way to systematics .",
    "when we work with real data , we use the rms minimization of the difference between the data and the synthesis models to determine the best radial velocity shift of the observed stars along with the best  fit stellar parameters . a narrow search range in radial velocity space is first selected by inspection . the data and models are interpolated to a higher dispersion ( r@xmath63 )",
    "we then use the minimum rms of the residuals to the fit to select the best sub  pixel radial velocity shift .",
    "tests with artificial spectra show that random errors in the radial velocity determination due to noise in the spectrum are small ( @xmath64 km s@xmath2 ) for spectra with s / n @xmath35 30 per pixel ( r@xmath65 ) .",
    "we also examined how errors in the radial velocity fit affect our determination of the stellar parameters .",
    "for a s / n @xmath3630 per pixel , noise in the spectra is a much more significant factor in causing errors in @xmath3 than the error in the radial velocity determination .",
    "stellar parameters determined mostly from line depths ( i.e. effective temperature and veiling ) , are not sensitive to radial velocity errors at the 5 km s@xmath2 level .",
    "we can use the spectra we have taken in the 2.2 @xmath4 m na interval of mk standard stars to perform a real  world test of our fitting technique .",
    "we discuss here the test results for t@xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "we also add an artificial infrared excess and rotation velocity to the mk standards in order to look for systematic effects in the determination of r@xmath45 and refine our understanding of such effects on our determination of @xmath3 .",
    "the high resolution spectra we use to derive stellar parameters are imperfect representations of the source spectra .",
    "systematic problems with the data include imperfect flat  fielding , defects in the cancellation of telluric features and the presence of scattered light or leaked out  of  order stellar radiation .",
    "the use of high resolution spectra in our analysis reduces the effect of these problems substantially . by choosing restricted wavelength intervals over which to match the synthetic models to the data , we minimize flat  fielding effects since mismatches in the shapes of the synthetic and observed lines then play a bigger role in influencing the rms difference . at high spectral resolution ,",
    "the residuals of telluric lines cover a limited and known part of wavelength space .",
    "we simply exclude these regions from our fitting spectral matching intervals .",
    "scattered light is usually removed in the data analysis if the source and sky have been switched regularly between two positions along the slit .    the continuum level for our spectra could be another free parameter in our spectral fitting routine , though we have chosen to leave the continuum fixed when finding the minimum rms difference between the target and synthetic spectra . for our target spectra",
    ", we have normalized the continuum based on a linear fit of two points close to the edges of the spectrum and farthest from na i lines where the potential influence by any damping wings is minimized . in some cases where the instantaneous spectral coverage of the spectrometer is limited",
