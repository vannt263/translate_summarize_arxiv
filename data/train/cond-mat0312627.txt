    "<S> the results obtained follow from monte carlo simulations and from the stochastic model we propose for dipole field diffusion . correlations established before quenching are shown to later drive the magnetization process . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that in simple cubic lattices , @xmath3 at time @xmath4 after @xmath2 is applied , as observed in fe@xmath5 , but only for @xmath6 time decades , where @xmath7 is some near  neighbor magnetic dipolar field and a spin reversal can occur only if the magnetic field acting on it is within some field window ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath9 behavior is not universal . for bcc and fcc lattices , @xmath10 , but @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> an expression for @xmath12 in terms of lattice parameters is derived . at later times </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization levels off to a constant value . </S>",
    "<S> all these processes take place at approximately constant magnetic energy if the annealing energy @xmath13 is larger than the tunneling window s energy width ( i.e. , if @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thermal processes come in only later on to drive further magnetization growth . </S>"
