    "the evolution of he in the galaxy has first been considered to be straightforward , dominated by the net production of this light element by low mass stars ( i.e. , with masses lower than 2 ) . in these objects , initial d",
    "is processed to he during the pre - main sequence phase .",
    "then , as described by iben ( 1967 ) , an he peak builds up due to pp - reactions on the main sequence , and is engulfed in the stellar convective envelope during the first dredge - up on the lower red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "standard theory predicts that , once in the convective layers of the evolved star , he can not be destroyed because of the too cool temperature in these regions .",
    "it is finally ejected in the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the latest stages of stellar evolution . in this standard view",
    ", the abundance of he must increase in the galaxy as soon as low mass stars begin to polute the ism ( rood et al .",
    "one expects then to have constraints on the cosmological abundance of he ( yang et al .",
    "1984 ) .",
    "recent observations of a few planetary nebulae ( pn ; rood et al .",
    "1992 , balser et al .",
    "1997 ) led to the measurement of he in one object , ngc 3242 .",
    "this pn , which estimated initial mass is 1.2@xmath30.2 ( galli et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter gstp97 ) , presents a value of he / h@xmath4 , in very good agreement with standard predictions ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 , charbonnel 1995 , dearborn et al .",
    "1996 , weiss et al .",
    "1996 for the most recent computations ) .",
    "this value however differs by almost two orders of magnitude with the he abundance in the proto - solar nebula , he / h=@xmath5 ( geiss 1993 ) , in the local interstellar cloud , he / h=@xmath6 ( gloeckler & geiss 1996 ) , and in galactic hii regions , he / h=@xmath7 ( balser et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "these low values are in clear contradiction with the conventional scenario for galactic evolution of the he abundance , and can not be explained if all low mass stars , such as ngc 3242 , happen to return all their he to the ism .",
    "gstp97 showed that , in order to fit the galactic constraints , he should be destroyed in at least 70@xmath8 of low - mass stars before they become pn .",
    "rood et al . ( 1984 ) suggested that the destruction of he could be related to chemical anomalies such as the very low carbon isotopic ratios observed in low - mass red giants .",
    "indeed , while standard models predict post - dredge up values of the 2sur13 ratio between 20 and 30 ( depending on the stellar mass and metallicity ; see charbonnel 1994 ) , pop ii field and globular cluster giants present 2sur13 ratios lower than 10 , even down to the near - equilibrium value of 4 in many cases .",
    "this discrepancy also exists , but to a lower extent , in evolved stars belonging to open clusters with turnoff masses lower than 2 ( see charbonnel et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter cbw98 , for references ) .",
    "the 2sur13 data point out the existence of an extra - mixing process that becomes efficient in low mass rgb stars as soon as they reach the so - called luminosity function bump ( gilroy & brown 1991 , hereafter gb91 ; charbonnel 1994 ; pilachowski et al 1997 ; cbw98 ) .",
    "different groups have simulated extra - mixing between the base of the convective envelope and the hydrogen - burning shell in order to reproduce the chemical anomalies in rgb stars .",
    "these non - standard models predict that the mechanism which is responsible for the low 2sur13 ratios on the rgb must also lead to the destruction of he by a large factor in the bulk of the envelope material ( charbonnel 1995 , wasserburg et al .",
    "1995 , weiss et al .",
    "1996 ) , and confirm the estimation of hogan ( 1995 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the observations of 2sur13 in evolved stars to determine statistically what fraction of low - mass stars experience this extra - mixing on the rgb , and are then expected to destroy their he .",
    "we collected in the literature all the available observations of 2sur13 ratios in stars of luminosity classes iii and iv - iii in the spectral ranges f to k. the whole sample contains 191 stars , with [ fe / h ] values between -2.8 and 0.3 .",
    "our 85 field stars have been observed by lambert & ries ( 1981 ) , cottrell & sneden ( 1986 ) , sneden et al .",

    "the data for galactic cluster giants are from gb91 for ngc 2682 ( m67 ) and gilroy ( 1989 ) for ngc 752 , ngc 2360 , ic 4756 . for globular clusters",
    ", we use the data from brown & wallerstein ( 1989 ) for ngc 104 , ngc 5139 , ngc 6121 ( m4 ) , ngc 6656 ( m22 ) , from smith & suntzeff ( 1989 ) for ngc 6121 and ngc 6656 , from suntzeff & smith ( 1991 ) for ngc 6121 and ngc 6752 , from shetrone ( 1996 ) for ngc 6205 ( m13 ) , from briley et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for ngc 6838 , and from cbw98 for 47 tuc .",
    "when different values of the 2sur13 ratio are given by different authors for the same star , we take the most recent determination .",
    "we use the [ fe / h ] values quoted in the respective papers .",
    "the determination of the 2sur13 ratio in our sample is not homogeneous .",
    "this is however not a problem for our statistical study : we consider that a star has undergone extra - mixing when its 2sur13 is smaller than 15 , i.e. , well below the minimum standard post dredge - up prediction .",
    "it is crucial however to have secure constraints on the evolutionary state of our sample stars . indeed , as shown by gb91 and cbw98 , the extra - mixing becomes efficient on the rgb only after the luminosity function bump .",
    "our statistics must thus be done only for stars that have already passed this evolutionary state .",
    "the luminosity of the bump slightly depends on the initial metallicity . in the [ fe / h ]",
    "range we consider , m@xmath9 is higher than @xmath10 -0.2 ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1990 ) .    for the field stars",
    ", we use the m@xmath11 and the parallaxes given in the hipparcos catalogue to get m@xmath11 . for the globular cluster stars , we take the m@xmath11 values given in the respective papers quoted above .",
    "precise absolute magnitudes depend on the cluster distance modulus , which is probably still uncertain .",
    "however , it matters only here to be sure that the cluster stars that we take into account in our final statistics are more luminous than the bump .    in our sample",
    ", we may have clump or agb stars .",
    "among the 106 cluster giants , 10 objects have probably already reached this phase . however , their 2sur13 ratios does not differ ( except in one case discussed in  4.3 ) from the ones of the stars that are ascending the rgb for the first time and have passed the bump . including them in the sample does not modify the final statistics .",

    "only one star shows a 2sur13 ratio higher than the standard predictions : v8 in ngc 6656 ( m22 ) .",
    "this star presents enhanced srii and baii lines ( mallia 1976 ) and is probably a star enriched in @xmath1c and s - elements .    *",
    "hd 95689*(@xmath12uma ) .   the relatively high li abundance ( logn(li ) = 1.26 , lambert et al",
    ". 1980 ) observed in this spectroscopic binary is another indication that this star did not suffer any extra - mixing on the rgb .",
    "it corresponds to the expected post - dilution li for a star more massive than 1.7 - 2m@xmath13 ( see charbonnel & vauclair 1992 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observed 2sur13 ratio and with the stellar m@xmath14 value we obtain with the hipparcos data .",
    "for such an initial stellar mass , the extra - mixing is not expected to occur on the rgb , and this star should be excluded from the present statistics .    *",
    "hd 112989*.   when [ fe / h ] is higher than -0.5 , the lower envelope of the 2sur13 ratio lies around 12 .",
    "one star however , hd 112989 , lies well below this limit . for this binary star ,",
    "important differences appear in the various estimations of [ fe / h ] available in the literature ( -0.44 , yamashita 1964 ; + 0.3 , lambert & ries 1981 ; + 0.14 , mcwilliam 1990 ; -0.05 , dracke & lambert 1994 ) . a smaller value of [ fe / h ] would replace this star in the  normality \" .    on the other hand , this weak - g band star presents a vsini value of 11km.sec@xmath15 , which is much higher than the mean rotational velocity for giants with the same spectral type ( de medeiros 1990 , 1998 ) . among the stars of our sample for which rotational velocity has been measured with the coravel spectrometer ,",
    "this star is the fastest rotator , all the others having vsini lower than 5 km.sec@xmath15 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "we have assembled all the observations of the 2sur13 ratio in field and cluster giants available in the literature . using the hipparcos parallaxes , we get constraints on the evolutionary status of our sample stars .",
    "we determine that 96@xmath8 of low - mass stars do experience an extra - mixing process on the rgb and are then expected to destroy their he . while consistent  non - standard \" stellar models are needed to explain the various chemical anomalies in low - mass rgb stars in order to obtain reliable he yields , we can already conclude that the very high percentage we get satisfies the galactic requirements for the evolution of the he abundance .",
