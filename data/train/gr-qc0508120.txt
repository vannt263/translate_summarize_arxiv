    "the consistent implementation of the gravitational interaction into the quantum framework is considered to be _ the _ outstanding problem in fundamental physics .",
    "a big obstacle so far is the lack of a direct experimental hint .",
    "therefore , the motivations for the need of such a theory are at present purely theoretical .",
    "these motivations strongly indicate , however , that the present framework of theoretical physics is incomplete . in the following",
    "i shall briefly discuss the main reasons that motivate the search for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "more details on this as well as on the other issues discussed in this review can be found in my monograph @xcite to which i refer the reader for more details and references .",
    "why should one believe that there is a need for a quantum theory of gravity ?    * _ singularity theorems _",
    ": under very general conditions , it follows from general relativity ( gr ) that singularities in spacetime are unavoidable @xcite .",
    "gr , therefore , predicts its own breakdown .",
    "this applies in particular to the universe as a whole : there are strong indications for the presence of an initial singularity ( this can be inferred from the existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation ) .",
    "since the classical theory is then no longer applicable , a more comprehensive theory must be found  the general expectation is that this is a _",
    "quantum _ theory of gravity .",
    "* _ initial conditions in cosmology _",
    ": this is related to the first point .",
    "cosmology as such is incomplete if its beginning can not be described in physical terms .",
    "it seems that even an inflationary epoch can not avoid a singularity in the past @xcite .",
    "inflation itself is based on the ` no - hair conjecture ' according to which spacetime approaches locally de  sitter space if a positive ( effective ) cosmological constant is present .",
    "an implicit assumption for the validity of the no - hair conjecture is that modes smaller than the planck scale ( see below ) are not excited to macroscopic scales ( ` trans - planckian problem ' ) . * _ evolution of black holes _ : black holes radiate with a temperature proportional to @xmath0 , the hawking temperature @xcite , see below . for the final evaporation ,",
    "a full theory of quantum gravity is needed since the semiclassical approximation leading to the hawking temperature then breaks down . * _ unification of all interactions _ :",
    "all non - gravitational interactions have so far been successfully accomodated into the quantum framework .",
    "gravity couples universally to all forms of energy .",
    "one would therefore expect that in a unified theory of all interactions , also gravity is described in quantum terms . * _ inconsistency of an exact semiclassical theory _ :",
    "all attempts to construct a fundamental theory where a classical gravitational field is coupled to quantum fields have failed up to now @xcite . such a semiclassical theory seems to exist only in an approximate sense . * _ avoidance of divergences _ : it has long been speculated that quantum gravity may lead to a theory devoid of the ubiquitous divergences arising in quantum field theory .",
    "this may happen , for example , through the emergence of a natural cutoff at small distances ( large momenta ) .",
    "in fact , modern approaches such as string theory or loop quantum gravity ( see below ) provide indications for a discrete structure at small scales .",
    "at which scale(s ) would one expect that effects of quantum gravity necessarily occur ? as shown by max planck in 1899 , gravitational constant @xmath1 , quantum of action @xmath0 and speed of light @xmath2 can be combined in a unique way ( apart from numerical factors ) to provide fundamental units of length , time , and mass , respectively .",
    "these ` planck units ' read @xmath3 one might think that the presence of a fundamental length scale is not a lorentz invariant notion .",
    "this is , however , not necessarily the case because special relativity can not be applied in this regime and , moreover , lengths should be related to eigenvalues of a geometric quantum operator , cf .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion in the framework of loop quantum gravity .",
    "quantization of gravity means quantization of geometry .",
    "but which structures should be quantized , that is , to which structures should one apply the superposition principle ?",

    "[ fig_berlin05_1 ]        structures that are not quantized remain as absolute ( non - dynamical ) entities in the formalism .",

    "this is referred to as _ background independence _ of the theory .",
    "* problem of time *    a particular aspect of background independence is the ` problem of time ' , which arises in any approach to quantum gravity . on the one hand , time is external in ordinary quantum theory ; the parameter @xmath4 in the schrdinger equation , @xmath5 is identical to newton s absolute time ",
    "it is _ not _ turned into an operator and is presumed to be prescribed from the outside .",
    "this is true also in special relativity where the absolute time @xmath4 is replaced by minkowski spacetime , which is again an absolute structure .    on the other hand , time in general relativity",
    "is dynamical because it is part of spacetime described by einstein s equations , @xmath6 both concepts can not be true fundamentally .",
    "it is expected that the fundamental theory does not contain any absolute structure .",
    "we shall see below how far present approaches to quantum gravity implement background independence .",

    "the final phase , where @xmath10-radiation is being emitted , could be observable .",
    "the temperature is unobservably small for black holes that result from stellar collapse .",
    "one would need primordial black holes produced in the early universe because they could possess a sufficiently low mass @xcite .",
    "for example , black holes with an initial mass of @xmath11 g would evaporate at the present age of the universe . in spite of several attempts ,",
    "no experimental hint for black - hole evaporation has been found .",

    "the quantum aspect of the gravitational field only emerges in a certain limit in which the different interactions can be distinguished .",
    "* there are a couple of other attempts such as quantization of topology , or the theory of causal sets , which i will not address in this short review .",
    "* perturbative quantum gravity *    historically , the first attempt to quantize gravity was through perturbation theory . in 1930 , lon rosenfeld investigated the gravitational field produced by an electromagnetic field and calculated the gravitational self - energy after quantization @xcite .",
    "it turned out to be infinite .",
    "infinities have been encountered before in the self - energy of the electron , and rosenfeld did his calculation ( following a question by werner heisenberg ) to see whether such infinities already occur in situations where only ` fields ' ( no ` matter fields ' such as electrons ) are present .",
    "perturbation theory starts by decomposing the metric , @xmath17 , into a background part , @xmath18 , and a ` small ' perturbation , @xmath19 , from now on . ]",
    "@xmath20 the important assumption is the presence of an ( approximate ) _ background _ with respect to which standard perturbation theory ( formulation of feynman rules , etc . ) can be applied . in this approximate framework",
    "the quantum aspects of gravity are encoded in a spin-2 particle propagating on the background ",
    "graviton_. in contrast to yang  mills theory , however , the ensuing perturbation theory is _ non - renormalizable _ : at each order in the expansion with respect to @xmath1 , new types of divergences occur which have to be absorbed into appropriate parameters that have to be fixed by measurement .",
    "all together , one would have to introduce infinitely many parameter , rendering the theory useless .",
    "an explicit calculation of the _ 2loop divergence _ in 1985 has shown that the divergences are real and that there is no ` miraculous ' cancellation of divergences already in the absence of non - gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "the corresponding divergent two - loop lagrangian reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a regularization parameter ( from dimensional regularization ) that goes to zero and thus produces a divergence .",
    "the presence of supersymmetry ( susy ) alleviates the occurrence of divergences ; they , however , appear at higher loops and thus do not seem to prevent the theory from being perturbatively non - renormalizable .    * effective field theories and renormalization group *    even if the theory is perturbatively non - renormalizable , it may lead to _ definite predictions _ at low energies .",
    "this is the framework of ` effective field theories ' . as an example i quote the quantum gravitational correction to the newtonian potential , calculated in @xcite , @xmath23",
    "this result is independent of the ambiguities that are present at higher energies .",
    "in fact , effective field theories are successfully applied elsewhere , for example , ` chiral perturbation theory ' in qcd ( where one considers the limit of the pion mass @xmath24 ) is such an effective theory .    a theory that is perturbatively non - renormalizable",
    "may still be non - perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "a standard example is the three - dimensional gross  neveu model with a large number of flavour components @xcite .",
    "could this happen for quantum general relativity , too ?",
    "a theory may be ` asymptotically safe ' in the sense that a non - gaussian ( non - vanishing ) ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point exists non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are indications that this is the case @xcite : consider an ` einstein ",

    ", it is found in @xcite that the dimensionless versions of these parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , have an uv attractive non - gaussian fixed point at values @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath33 , @xmath34 the gravitational constant thus vanishes in this limit ( for @xmath35 ) , and the theory would be asymptotically free . using more general truncations , it may also be possible to obtain a small positive cosmological constant as a strong infrared quantum effect @xcite and to get a growth of @xmath1 at large distances which could explain the observed flat galaxy rotation curves @xcite .",
    "although these results have been obtained within special truncations and may not survive in the full theory , they show that quantum gr could in principle be perturbatively renormalizable and lead to testable predictions even at a macroscopic level ( and what could be more macroscopic than galaxies ) .",
    "this is also the hope for the approaches to quantum gr presented below .",
    "* path integrals *    in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , path integrals provide a convenient tool for a wide range of applications . among them",

    ", this is an impossible task .",
    "attention is therefore restricted to a given topology ( or to a sum over few topologies ) .",
    "still , the evaluation of an expression such as meets great mathematical and conceptual difficulties .    from a methodological point of view",
    ", one distinguishes between a euclidean and a lorentzian version of the path integral . in the euclidean version ,",
    "one performs a wick rotation @xmath37 in the action and integrates over euclidean metrics only . in ordinary quantum field theory",
    ", this improves the convergence properties of the path integral . in quantum gravity",
    ", however , the situation is different because the euclidean action is unbounded from below .",
    "this unboundedness is not necessarily a problem as long as one is only concerned with a saddle point approximation of the path integral , that is , a wkb aproximation of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the extremal value of the euclidean action .",
    "such an approximation lies , in fact , at the heart of one of the prominent proposals for boundary conditions in quantum cosmology  the ` no - boundary condition ' or ` hartle  hawking proposal ' @xcite .",
    "this consists of two parts .",
    "first , it is assumed that the euclidean form of the path integral is fundamental , and that the lorentzian structure of the world only emerges in situations where the saddle point is complex .",
    "second , it is assumed that one integrates over metrics with one boundary only ( the boundary corresponding to the present universe ) , so that no ` initial ' boundary is present ; this is the origin of the term ` no - boundary proposal ' .",
    "the absence of an initial boundary is implemented through appropriate regularity conditions . in the simplest situation",
    ", one finds as the dominating geometry the ` hartle  hawking instanton ' depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_berlin05_2 ] : the dominating contribution at small radii is ( half of the ) euclidean four - sphere @xmath40 , whereas for bigger radii it is ( part of ) de sitter space , which is the analytic continuation of @xmath40 .",
    "both geometries are matched at a three - geometry with vanishing extrinsic curvature .",
    "the lorentzian nature of our universe would thus only be an ` emergent ' phenomenon .",
    "[ fig_berlin05_2 ]        in more general situations , one has to look for integration contours in the space of complex metrics that render the integral convergent .",
    "consider one quantum cosmological example discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it describes a scalar field ( called @xmath41 after a field redefinition ) conformally coupled to the scale factor , @xmath42 , of a friedmann universe .",
    "the classical solutions are confined to a rectangle centred around the origin in the @xmath43-plane .",
    "one can explicitly construct wave packets that follow these classical trajectories .",
    "( they are solutions of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation discussed below . )",
    "the corresponding quantum states are normalizable in both the @xmath42 and the @xmath41 direction",
    ". a general quantum gravitational ( cosmological ) path integral depends on two values for @xmath42 and @xmath41 , called @xmath44 and @xmath45 . respectively .",
    "3 shows the corresponding @xmath46 space ; the values for @xmath47 and @xmath48 define the origin of the ` light cones ' depicted in the figure by bullets .",
    "the hartle  hawking wave function is obtained for @xmath49 , that is , for the case when the light cones in fig .  3",
    "shrink to one cone centred at the origin .",
    "for this model , the path integral can be evaluated _",
    "exactly_. the investigation in @xcite has shown that there is no contour for the path integration in the complex - metric plane that leads to a wave function which can be used in the construction of wave packets following the classical trajectories : the resulting wave functions either diverge along the ` light cones ' or they diverge for large values of @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "the states are thus not normalizable , and it is not clear how they should be interpreted .    [ fig_berlin05_3 ]     and @xmath41 .",
    "they exhibit oscillatory behaviour in the shaded regions.,width=302 ]    * dynamical triangulation *    an alternative method to attack the full path integral is dynamical triangulation , cf . @xcite and the references therein .",
    "here one starts from a _",
    "path integral in the first place and employs a discretization of the geometry ( a euclidean formulation is used in an intermediate step of the calculations ) .",
    "in contrast to earlier attempts such as regge calculus , the edge lengths of simplices are held _ fixed _ ; the sum is then performed over all possible manifold gluings of equilateral simplices , using monte carlo simulations .",
    "some interesting results have already been obtained .",
    "first , the hausdorff dimension @xmath50 of space , defined by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the space volume , is found to read @xmath53 .",
    "this is an indication for the three - dimensionality of space ( and thus for the four - dimensionality of spacetime ) .",
    "since there is no background in quantum gravity , the dimension @xmath54 of the geometries to be summed over in the path integral does not need to be identical to the resulting value for @xmath55 .",
    "strangely enough , one had found earlier that for a euclidean path integral the result is always @xmath56 for @xmath35 .",
    "second , a positive value for the cosmological constant , @xmath57 , is needed .",
    "this is in accordance with results from recent measurements of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "however , no special value for @xmath58 seems to be preferred .",
    "third , for large scales the volume seems to behave semiclassically .",
    "however , in spite of these promising hints , a continuum limit is still elusive .",
    "one of the earliest attempts to quantize gravity employs a hamiltonian approach . in a first step , the classical theory ( gr )",
    "is reformulated in ` 3 + 1 form ' in which it describes the dynamics of three - geometries ( with matter fields on them ) .",
    "global hyperbolicity of the spacetime from which one starts is a necessary prerequisite .",
    "it must be emphasized that the topology of the three - dimensional space @xmath59 is fixed , that is , there is one canonical theory for each topology . in a second step , the canonical variables , that is , the configuration variable and its momentum ( the ` symplectic structure ' ) is chosen .",
    "the third step then addresses the canonical quantization procedure",
    ". the most straightforward approach would be to choose the three - metric and its conjugate momentum ( which is a linear function of the second fundamental form ) .",
    "the resulting quantum theory is called ` quantum geometrodynamics ' and is historically the oldest approach . more recently",
    ", alternative systems of variables have proved to be of great interest ; because they can be interpreted as a connection or a loop variable , the corresponding approaches are called ` quantum connection dynamics ' or ` loop quantum gravity ' .",
    "i shall review these approaches briefly in the following .",
    "the central equations are the _ quantum constraints_. the invariance of the classical theory under coordinate transformation leads to four ( local ) constraints : the hamiltonian constraint , @xmath60 and the three diffeomorphism ( or momentum ) constraints , @xmath61 the total gravitational hamiltonian reads ( apart from boundary terms ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 ( ` lapse function ' ) and @xmath64 ( ` shift vector ' ) are lagrange multipliers . in the connection and loop approaches ,",
    "three additional ( local ) constraints emerge because of the freedom to choose the local triads upon which the formulation is based .",
    "some interesting features occur for 2 + 1-dimensional spacetimes @xcite but i shall restrict myself in the following to the four - dimensional case .    * quantum geometrodynamics *    the canonical variables are the three - dimensional metric , @xmath65 , and its conjugate momentum . in this case",
    "one usually refers to ( or the full equation @xmath66 ) as the ` wheeler  dewitt equation ' . here",
    "are some characteristics of this approach :    * the wave functional @xmath67 depends on the _",
    "three_-dimensional metric , but because of it is invariant under coordinate transformations on three - space .",
    "* no external time parameter is present anymore  in this sense the theory is ` timeless ' .",
    "this also holds for the connection and loop approaches .",
    "* such constraints result from any theory that is classically reparametrization invariant , that is , a theory without background structure . *",
    "the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation is ( locally ) hyberbolic , and one can thereby define a local ` intrinsic time ' distinguished by the sign in this wave equation . * this approach is a candidate for a non - perturbative quantum theory of gravity . but even if it is superseded by a more fundamental theory at the planck scale ( such as superstring theory , see below ) , it should approximately be valid away from the planck scale .",
    "the reason is that gr is then approximately valid , and the quantum theory from which it emerges in the wkb limit is quantum geometrodynamics .",
    "let us consider a simple example : a friedmann universe with scale factor @xmath68 containing a massive scalar field @xmath69 .",
    "this is an interesting model for quantum cosmology ( see below ) . in this case",
    ", the diffeomorphism constraints are identically fulfilled , and the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation reads @xmath70 this equation is simple enough to find solutions ( at least numerically ) and to study physical aspects such as the dynamics of wave packets and the semiclassical limit @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approximation can be conveniently discussed also for the full wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation , at least in a formal sense ( i.e. , treating functional derivatives as if they were ordinary derivatives and neglecting the problem of anomalies ) .",
    "the discussion is also connected to the question : where does the imaginary unit in the ( functional ) schrdinger equation come from @xcite ?",
    "the full wheeler ",

    "semiclassical time @xmath4 is thus defined in this limit from the dynamical variables . *",
    "the next order of the born - oppenheimer scheme yields quantum gravitational correction terms proportional to the inverse planck mass squared , @xmath79 .",

    "the recovery of the schrdinger equation raises an interesting issue .",
    "it is well known that the notion of hilbert space is connected with the conservation of probability ( unitarity ) and thus with the presence of an external time ( with respect to which the probability is conserved ) .",
    "the question then arises whether the concept of a hilbert space is still required in the _ full _ theory where no external time is present .",
    "it could be that this concept makes sense only on the semiclassical level where holds .",
    "a major problem with quantum geometrodynamics is the lack of a precise mathematical framework for the full theory .",
    "this provides one with a motivation to look for alternatives .",

    "this could give an interesting connection between quantum cosmology and string theory .",
    "* information loss for black holes ? *    what happens during the final evaporation phase of a black hole ?",
    "this is a major question for any theory of quantum gravity to answer .",
    "a definite answer is , however , elusive , and part of the discussion has circled around the ` information - loss problem ' for black holes , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "what is the ` information - loss problem ' ?",
    "according to hawking s semiclassical calculations , a black hole radiates with a thermal spectrum , with the temperature given by . as a consequence ,",
    "the black hole loses mass and shrinks . in case that the hole completely evaporates and leaves only thermal radiation behind , _ any _ initial state for the black hole plus the quantum field would end with the _ same _ final state , which would be a thermal , that is , a mixed state",
    "this would correspond to a maximal loss of information about the initial state .",
    "in other words : unitarity would be violated for a closed system , in contrast to standard quantum theory .",
    "hawking originally argued that the final evaporation time , when the black hole has reached planck - mass size and the semiclassical approximation breaks down , is too short for the original information to be recovered .",
    "therefore , so his conclusion , there must be information loss in quantum gravity .",
    "more recently , hawking has withdrawn his original opinion @xcite .",
    "this switch is based on the argument that the full evolution is unitary if also components of the total wave function that do _ not _ evolve into a black hole are taken into account .",
    "as we have seen , in full quantum gravity there is no notion of external time .",
    "however , for an isolated system such as a black hole , one can refer to the semiclassical time of external observers far away from the hole .",
    "the notion of unitarity then refers to this concept of time .",
    "so , if the fundamental theory of quantum gravity is unitary in this sense , there can be no information loss .",
    "conversely , if the fundamental theory breaks unitarity in this sense , information loss is possible .",
    "as long as the situation with the full theory remains open , discussions of the information loss centre around assumptions and expectations .",
    "however , for a black hole whose mass is much bigger than the planck mass , the details of quantum gravity should be less relevant .",
    "it is of importance to emphasize that a ( large ) black hole is a macroscopic object .",
    "it is therefore strongly entangled with the quantum degrees of freedom with which it interacts .",
    "information thereby becomes essentially non - local .",
    "this entanglement leads to decoherence for the black hole which thereby assumes classical properties analogously to other macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "in particular , the black hole itself does not evolve unitarily , cf .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the interaction of the black hole with its hawking radiation is sufficient to provide the black hole with classical behaviour ; strictly speaking , the very notion of a black hole emerges through decoherence .",
    "the cases of a superposition of a black - hole state with its time - reversed version ( a ` white hole ' ) and with a no - hole state were considered and shown to decohere by hawking radiation .",
    "this does not hold for virtual black holes , which are time symmetric and do not exhibit classical behaviour .    in the original derivation of hawking radiation ,",
    "one starts with a quantum field which is in its vacuum state .",
    "the thermal appearance of the resulting hawking radiation is then recognized from the planckian form of the expectation value of particle - number operator at late times .",
    "if the state of the quantum field is evaluated on a spatial hypersurface that enters the horizon , tracing out the degrees of freedom of the hole interior yields a thermal density matrix with temperature in the outside region .",
    "( this is because the initial state of the field evolves into a two - mode squeezed state , and it is a general feature of such states that tracing out one mode leaves a thermal density matrix for the other mode .",
    ") however , one is not obliged to take a hypersurface that enters the horizon .",
    "one can consider a hypersurface that is locked at the bifurcation point ( where the surface of the collapsing star crosses the horizon ) .",
    "then , apart from its entanglement with the black hole itself , the field state remains pure .",
    "the observations far away from the hole should , however , not depend on the choice of the hypersurface @xcite .",
    "this is , in fact , what results @xcite : the entanglement of the squeezed state representing the hawking radiation with other ( irrelevant ) degrees of freedom leads to the thermal _ appearance _ of the field state .",
    "it therefore seems that there is no information - loss problem at the semiclassical level and that one can assume , at the present level of understanding , that the full evolution is unitary and that ` information loss ' can be understood in terms of the standard dislocalization of information due to decoherence .",
    "a similar point of view seems to emerge from discussions invoking string theory . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that black holes are inherently associated with mixed states and that pure d - brane states rapidly experience decoherence due to entanglement with other degrees of freedom",
    ". an analogous situation ( but without black holes ) was discussed in @xcite : consider the decay of a massive string state .",
    "the decay spectrum of a single excited state does not show thermal behaviour .",
    "if one , however , averages over all the degenerate states with the same mass ( justified by decoherence ) , the decay spectrum is planckian .",
    "the authors of @xcite have argued that black - hole geometries result for a coarse - graining over smooth microstates .",
    "quite generally , the thermodynamic properties of gravity seem to be a result of decoherence .",
    "* why quantum cosmology ? *    quantum cosmology is the application of quantum theory to the universe as a whole .",
    "independent of any particular interaction , such a theory is needed in view of the extreme sensitivity of quantum system to their environment , that is , to other degrees of freedom @xcite . however , since gravity is the dominating interaction on cosmic scales , a quantum theory of gravity is needed as a formal prerequisite for quantum cosmology .",
    "most work in quantum cosmology is based on the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation of quantum geometrodynamics .",
    "the method is to restrict first the configuration space to a finite number of variables ( scale factor , inflaton field ,  ) and then to quantize canonically . since the full configuration space of three - geometries is called ` superspace ' , the ensuing models are called ` minisuperspace models ' .",

    "this behaviour has consequences for the validity of the semiclassical approximation and the arrow of time ( see below ) .",
    "* fate of classical singularity *    can quantum gravity avoid the classical singularities ?",
    "so far no general criterium for singularity avoidance is available .",
    "an important question concerns the choice of an inner product which , for the quantum states in question , should be finite and conserved ( with respect to some appropriate intrinsic time or , for example in black - hole cases , with respect to an external semiclassical time ) .",

    "this is not a cosmological situation , but may serve as an appropriate analogy . *",
    "loop quantum cosmology : here the results of loop quantum gravity , notably the discrete spectrum of the geometric operators , are imposed on quantum cosmological models @xcite .",
    "the wheeler  de witt equation then becomes a _ difference equation _",

    "one has , for example , @xmath136 moreover , and more important , the difference equation can be continued through the ` classical singularity ' .",
    "this would be the analogue of the unitarity condition in standard quantum theory .",
    "the results of loop quantum cosmology have not yet been obtained from loop quantum gravity . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that issues such as singularity avoidance must be formulated in terms of physical quantities , that is , variables commuting with the hamiltonian constraint .",

    "* origin of irreversibility *    although most fundamental laws are invariant under time reversal , there are several classes of phenomena in nature that exhibit an arrow of time @xcite .",
    "it is generally expected that there is an underlying master arrow of time behind these phenomena , and that this master arrow can be found in cosmology .",
    "if there is a special initial condition of low entropy , statistical arguments can be invoked to demonstrate that the entropy of the universe will increase with increasing size .",
    "there are several subtle issues connected with this problem .",
    "first , one does not yet know a general expression for the entropy of the gravitational field , except for the black - hole entropy .",
    "roger penrose has suggested to use the weyl tensor as a measure of gravitational entropy , see , for example , @xcite for references and recent discussions .",
    "second , since the very early universe is involved , the problem has to be treated within quantum gravity .",
    "but as we have seen , there is no external time in quantum gravity ",
    "so what does the notion ` arrow of time ' mean ?    for definiteness",
    "i want to base the discussion on quantum geometrodynamics , that is , on the wheeler  dewitt equation .",
    "it should be possible to do the same within loop quantum gravity or string theory .",
    "an important observation is that the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation exhibits a fundamental asymmetry with respect to the ` intrinsic time ' defined by the sign of the kinetic term .",
    "very schematically , one can write this equation as @xmath137\\right ) \\ , \\psi = 0 \\ , \\ ] ] where again @xmath138 , and the @xmath139 denote inhomogeneous degrees of freedom describing perturbations of the friedmann universe ; they can describe weak gravitational waves or density perturbations .",
    "the important property of the equation is that the potential becomes small for @xmath140 ( where the classical singularities would occur ) , but complicated for increasing @xmath141 ; the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation thus possesses an asymmetry with respect to ` intrinsic time ' @xmath141 .",
    "one can in particular impose the simple boundary condition @xmath142 which would mean that the degrees of freedom are initially _ not _ entangled . defining an entropy as the entanglement entropy between relevant degrees of freedom ( such as @xmath141 ) and irrelevant degrees of freedom ( such as most of the @xmath139 ) , this entropy vanishes initially but increases with increasing @xmath141 because entanglement increases due to the presence of the potential .",
    "in the semiclassical limit where @xmath4 is constructed from @xmath141 ( and other degrees of freedom ) , cf . , entropy increases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this then _ defines _ the direction of time and would be the origin of the observed irreversibility in the world .",
    "the expansion of the universe would then be a tautology . due to the increasing entanglement",
    ", the universe rapidly assumes classical properties for the relevant degrees of freedom due to decoherence @xcite .",
    "decoherence is here calculated by integrating out the @xmath139 in order to arrive at a reduced density matrix for @xmath141 .",
    "this process has interesting consequences for a classically recollapsing universe @xcite . since big bang and big crunch correspond to the same region in configuration space ( @xmath143 ) , an initial condition for @xmath143 would encompass both regions , cf .",
    "[ fig_berlin05_6ab ] .",
    "this would mean that the above initial condition would always correlate increasing size of the universe with increasing entropy : the arrow of time would formally reverse at the classical turning point .",
    "as it turns out , however , a reversal can not be observed because the universe would enter a quantum phase @xcite .",
    "further consequences concern black holes in such a universe because no horizon and no singularity would ever form .",
    "needless to say that these considerations are speculative .",
    "they demonstrate , however , that interesting consequences would result in quantum cosmology if the underlying equations were taken seriously .",
    "up to now there are only expectations and hopes . here",
    "i collect a brief list of possible tests of quantum gravity , cf . @xcite and the references therein :    * evaporation of black holes :",
    "this can only be observed if there are primordial black holes ( or large extra dimensions ) . * the origin of masses and coupling constants should be understandable from a fundamental theory .",
    "this concerns in particular the origin of the cosmological constant @xmath58 ( or dark energy ) . * quantum gravitational corrections could perhaps be seen in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background , or in other cases .",
    "* a fundamental theory could predict varying coupling constants , a violation of the equivalence principle and/or a violation of lorentz invariance . *",
