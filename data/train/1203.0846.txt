    "although real flows are always three - dimensional , it sometimes happens that the motion of a fluid is essentially planar in the sense that the fluid velocity in some distinguished spatial direction is negligible compared to the velocity in the orthogonal plane .",
    "this situation often occurs for fluids in thin layers , or for rapidly rotating fluids where the coriolis force strongly penalizes displacements along the axis of rotation .",
    "typical examples are geophysical flows , for which the geometry of the domain ( the atmosphere or the ocean ) and the effect of the earth s rotation concur to make a two - dimensional approximation accurate and efficient @xcite .    from a mathematical point of view , planar flows are substantially easier to study than three - dimensional ones .",
    "for instance , it is known since the pioneering work of j. leray @xcite that the two - dimensional incompressible navier - stokes equations are globally well - posed in the energy space , whereas global well - posedness is still an open problem in the three - dimensional case , no matter which function space is used @xcite .",
    "the situation is essentially the same for the incompressible euler equations , which describe the motion of inviscid fluids @xcite .",
    "however , having global solutions at hand does not mean that we fully understand the dynamics of the system .",
    "as a matter of fact , we are not able to establish on a rigorous basis the phenomenological laws of two - dimensional freely decaying turbulence , and the stability properties of 2d boundary layers in the high reynolds number regime are not fully understood .    in these notes",
    ", we consider the idealized situation of an incompressible viscous fluid filling the whole plane @xmath0 and evolving freely without exterior forcing . following the approach of helmholtz @xcite",
    ", we use the vorticity formulation of the problem , which is more appropriate to investigate the qualitative behavior of the solutions .",
    "our goal is to understand the stability properties and the interactions of localized vortical structures at high reynolds numbers .",
    "this question is important because carefully controlled experiments @xcite , as well as numerical simulations of two - dimensional freely decaying turbulence @xcite , suggest that vortex interactions , and especially vortex mergers , play a crucial role in the long - time dynamics of viscous planar flows , and are responsible in particular for the inverse energy cascade .",
    "although nonperturbative phenomena such as vortex mergers may be very hard to describe mathematically @xcite , we shall see that vortex interactions can be rigorously studied in the asymptotic regime where the distances between the vortex centers are much larger than the typical size of the vortex cores .",
    "we begin our analysis of the two - dimensional viscous vorticity equation in section  [ s2 ] .",
    "we first recall standard estimates for the two - dimensional biot - savart law , which expresses the velocity field in terms of the vorticity distribution , and we enumerate in section  [ ss2.1 ] some general properties of the vorticity equation , including conservation laws , lyapunov functions , and scaling invariance . in section  [ ss2.2 ] , we introduce the space of finite measures , which allows to consider nonsmooth flows such as vortex patches , vortex sheets , or point vortices . it is a remarkable fact that the vorticity equation is globally well - posed in such a large function space , for any value of the viscosity parameter , see @xcite and theorem  [ thm2 ] below .",
    "although a complete proof of that result is beyond the scope of these notes , we show in section  [ ss2.3 ] that the classical approach of fujita and kato @xcite applies to our problem and yields global existence and uniqueness of the solution provided that the atomic part of the initial vorticity distribution is sufficiently small . for larger initial data ,",
    "existence of a global solution can be proved by an approximation scheme @xcite but additional arguments are needed to establish uniqueness @xcite .",
    "section  [ s3 ] collects a few results which describe the behavior of global solutions of the vorticity equation in @xmath1 .",
    "in particular we prove convergence as @xmath2 to a family of self - similar solutions called _ lamb - oseen vortices _ , see @xcite and theorem  [ thm3 ] below . to establish these results",
    ", we use accurate estimates on the fundamental solution of convection - diffusion equations , which were obtained by osada @xcite and are reproduced in section  [ ss3.1 ] .",
    "another fundamental tool is a transformation into self - similar variables , which compactifies the trajectories of the system and allows to consider @xmath3-limit sets , see section  [ ss3.2 ] .",
    "using a pair of lyapunov functions , one of which is only defined for positive solutions , we establish a `` liouville theorem '' , which characterizes all complete trajectories of the vorticity equation in @xmath1 that are relatively compact in the self - similar variables .",
    "the conclusion is that all these trajectories necessarily coincide with oseen vortices , see proposition  [ liouville ] . in section  [ ss3.3 ] , we show that liouville s theorem implies theorem  [ thm3 ] , and proves at the same time that the vorticity equation has a unique solution when the initial flow is a point vortex of arbitrary circulation .",
    "this is an important particular case of theorem  [ thm2 ] , which can not be established by a standard application of gronwall s lemma .    in section  [ s4 ]",
    "we investigate in some detail the stability properties of the oseen vortices , which are steady states of the vorticity equation in the self - similar variables .",
    "we introduce in section  [ ss4.1 ] an appropriate weighted space for the admissible perturbations , and we show that the linearized operator at oseen s vortex has a remarkable structure in that space : it is the sum of a self - adjoint operator , which is essentially the harmonic oscillator , and a skew - symmetric relatively compact perturbation , which is multiplied by the circulation of the vortex .",
    "this structure almost immediately implies that oseen vortices are stable equilibria of the rescaled vorticity equation , and that the size of the local basin of attraction is uniform in the circulation parameter .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with many classical examples in fluid mechanics , such as the poiseuille flow or the couette - taylor flow , for which hydrodynamic instabilities are known to occur when the reynolds number becomes large @xcite . in the case of oseen vortices , we show in section  [ ss4.2 ] that a rapid rotation ( i.e. , a large circulation number ) has a _ stabilizing effect _ on the vortex : the size of the local basin of attraction increases , and the non - radially symmetric perturbations have a faster decay as @xmath2 .",
    "these empirically known facts can be rigorously established , although optimal spectral and pseudospectral estimates are not available yet .    in the final section of these notes ,",
    "we consider the particular situation where the initial vorticity is a superposition of @xmath4 dirac masses ( or point vortices ) .",
    "the corresponding solution of the two - dimensional vorticity equation is called the _",
    "viscous @xmath4-vortex solution _ , and the goal of section  [ s5 ] is to investigate its behavior in the vanishing viscosity limit . our main result , which is stated in section  [ ss5.1 ] , asserts that the viscous @xmath4-vortex solution is nicely approximated by a superposition of oseen vortices whose centers evolve according to the helmholtz - kirchhoff point vortex dynamics @xcite .",
    "this approximation is accurate as long as the distance between the vortex centers remains much larger than the typical size of the vortex cores , which increases through diffusion . in section  [ ss5.2 ]",
    ", we decompose the viscous @xmath4-vortex solution into a sum of gaussian vortex patches , and we introduce appropriate self - similar variables which allow us to formulate a stronger version of our result , taking into account the deformation of the vortices due to mutual interactions .",
    "the proof involves many technical issues which can not be addressed here , but we sketch the main arguments in section  [ ss5.3 ] and refer the interested reader to @xcite for more details . in particular , we show in section  [ ss5.3 ] how to systematically construct an asymptotic expansion of the viscous @xmath4-vortex solution , and we briefly indicate how the error terms can be controlled once a sufficiently accurate approximation is obtained .",
    "the content of the present notes is strongly biased toward the scientific interests of the author , and does not provide a comprehensive survey of all important questions in two - dimensional fluid dynamics .",
    "we chose to focus on self - similar vortices , but other types of flows such as vortex patches or vortex sheets also lead to interesting and challenging problems , especially in the vanishing viscosity limit .",
    "also , we should keep in mind that all real fluids are contained in domains with boundaries , so a comprehensive discussion of two - dimensional fluid mechanics should certainly include a description of the flow near the boundary , a question that is totally eluded here . on the other hand , we do not claim for much originality in these notes : all results collected here have already been published elsewhere , although they were never presented together in a unified way . in particular , most of the results of sections  [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] were obtained in collaboration with c.e .",
    "wayne @xcite , and the content of section  [ s5 ] is entirely borrowed from @xcite .",
    "the material presented in section  [ s2 ] is rather standard , although our proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] is perhaps not explicitly contained in the existing literature .",
    "the uniqueness part in theorem  [ thm2 ] , which is briefly discussed at the end of section  [ ss3.3 ] , was obtained in collaboration with i.  gallagher @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ ss4.2 ] , our approach to study the properties of the linearized operator at oseen s vortex in the large circulation regime was developed in a collaboration with i.  gallagher and f.  nier @xcite .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional incompressible navier - stokes equations : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the space variable and @xmath7 is the time variable .",

    "equivalently , the motion of a planar fluid can be described by the _ vorticity _ field : @xmath14 which represents the angular rotation of the fluid particles .",
    "if we take the two - dimensional curl of the first equation in , we obtain the evolution equation @xmath15 which is the starting point of our analysis .",
    "note that @xmath16 because @xmath17 . in the case of a perfect fluid ( @xmath18 ) ,",

    ", the vorticity also diffuses at a rate given by the kinematic viscosity .",

    "if @xmath50 , one can solve directly by a simple calculation in fourier space , which shows that @xmath20 belongs to the homogeneous sobolev space @xmath51 , but @xmath52 in general .",

    "the presentation is formal in the sense that we assume here that we are given a solution of with the appropriate smoothness and integrability properties .",
    "however , all calculations can be justified once suitable existence theorems have been established @xcite .",

    "this quantity is conserved due to the structure of eq .  .",

    "in particular , it plays a crucial role in the construction of global weak solutions of the three - dimensional navier - stokes equations @xcite . somewhat paradoxically",
    ", in unbounded two - dimensional domains , this quantity is not always useful because it is finite only if the total circulation vanishes .",

    "this quantity is well defined under mild integrability assumptions on @xmath3 , and can be finite even if the total circulation is nonzero .",
    "morever , @xmath97 is a lyapunov function : @xmath98 and it is straightforward to verify that @xmath99 if the velocity field associated to @xmath58 is square integrable . in this particular situation , @xmath97 does not depend on the parameter @xmath100 .      in the whole plane @xmath0 , the navier - stokes equations and the vorticity equation are invariant under the rescaling @xmath101 for any @xmath102 . to solve the cauchy problem ,",
    "it is rather natural to use space - time norms which are invariant under the transformation .",

    "in fact , there may be other obstructions to local well - posedness , but according to the above claim it is certainly not reasonable to try to solve the cauchy problem in function spaces that are `` strictly larger '' than the critical ones .    as far as the navier - stokes equation is concerned , we know since the work of leray @xcite that eq .",

    "as in , we define rescaled vorticities @xmath803 and velocities @xmath804 by setting @xmath805 our goal is to describe the vorticity profiles @xmath806 as precisely as possible , in the regime where @xmath807 . according to , we have @xmath808 for each @xmath797 , where @xmath290 is the profile of oseen s vortex .",
    "however , it is very important to realize that this leading order approximation is _ not sufficient _ to control the inviscid limit of the viscous @xmath4-vortex solution .",
    "the reason is that the profile @xmath290 is radially symmetric , and thus does not take into account the deformations of the vortices due to mutual interactions .",
    "if we go back to the explicit formula , we see that the velocity field of oseen s vortex is very large near the center if the viscosity @xmath755 is small , with a maximal angular speed of the order of @xmath809 .",
    "as long as the vortex stays isolated , this large velocity does not affect the vorticity distribution , which is perfectly radially symmetric .",
    "now , if the same vortex is advected by a non - homogenous external field , which in our case will be the velocity field produced by the other @xmath810 vortices , its vorticity profile gets deformed under the external strain and the vortex starts feeling the effect of its own velocity field .",
    "as is easily verified , this _ self - interaction _ effect is very strong if the circulation reynolds number @xmath517 is large , even for a moderate deformation of the vortex core .",
    "this gives a clear indication that self - interaction effects must be taken into account if one wants to control the vanishing viscosity limit in presence of point vortices .",
    "the deformation of a rapidly rotating oseen vortex advected by an external velocity field can be computed using the properties of the linearized operator @xmath533 , which was defined in section  [ s4 ] .",
    "remarkably enough , one finds that oseen s vortex adapts its shape in such a way that the self - interaction _ counterbalances _ the effect of the external field @xcite , except for radially symmetric corrections and for a rigid translation .",
    "this is related to lemma  [ kerlam ] , which shows that the kernel of the operator @xmath547 consists of all radially symmetric functions and of the two - dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath811 .",
    "this fundamental fact explains why one can observe , in turbulent two - dimensional flows , stable asymmetric vortices which in a first approximation are simply advected by the main stream @xcite .    in section  [ ss5.3 ]",

    "@xmath812 $ ] , the approximated vortex profile will be of the form @xmath813 where @xmath814 is a radially symmetric function of @xmath389 which we will not describe precisely because it only represents a small perturbation of the gaussian profile @xmath815 . the important correction at this order is the nonsymmetric function @xmath816 which is given by @xmath817 where we denote @xmath818 .",
    "here @xmath819 is a smooth , positive function satisfying @xmath820 as @xmath821 and @xmath822 as @xmath823 for some @xmath824 .",

    "each term in this expansion can in turn be developed in powers of the inverse circulation reynolds number @xmath825 .",
    "the most important effect is due to the nonsymmetric term @xmath816 , which describes to leading order the deformation of the @xmath826 vortex due to the influence of the other vortices . keeping only that term and using polar coordinates @xmath827",
    ", we can rewrite in the following simplified form @xmath828 where @xmath829 and @xmath830 is the argument of the planar vector @xmath818 .",
    "this formula allows us to compute the principal axes and the eccentricities of the vorticity contours , which are elliptical at this level of approximation .    to formulate our result in its final form ,",
    "we introduce a function space that is appropriate to control the vorticity profiles . given a small @xmath331 , which will be specified later , we define the weighted @xmath40 space @xmath831 equipped with the norm @xmath832 in particular , we have @xmath833 for any @xmath324 .",
    "as is explained in @xcite , it would be more natural to use here the gaussian space @xmath540 defined in , but for technical reasons it appears necessary to replace the gaussian weight by an exponential one , at least if the ratio @xmath785 is large .    [ propfinal ] assume that the point vortex system is well - posed on the time interval @xmath778 $ ] , and let @xmath764 be the solution of with initial data .",
    "then there exist positive constants @xmath333 and @xmath834 , depending only on the ratio @xmath785 , such that , if @xmath764 is decomposed as in , then the rescaled profiles @xmath806 defined by satisfy @xmath835 for all @xmath218 $ ] , provided @xmath836 .    as is clear from , , and , proposition  [ propfinal ] implies immediately theorem  [ thm4 ] .",
    "note that the error term on the right - hand side of is smaller than in , and in particular smaller than the first order corrections to the gaussian profile in .",
    "this means that the deformations of the interacting vortices are indeed described , to leading order , by . according to that formula",
    ", each vortex adapts its shape _ instantaneously _ to the relative positions of the other vortices , without oscillations or inertia . by this we mean",
    "that , for each @xmath218 $ ] , the angular factor @xmath837 in , which gives the leading order deformation up to a time - dependent prefactor @xmath838 , is entirely determined by the instantaneous positions of the vortex centers . in contrast , it is shown in @xcite that the first order radially symmetric corrections @xmath814 do not only depend on the instantaneous vortex positions , but on the whole history of the system .",
    "it is instructive at this point to recall what is known in the more general situation where the initial data are not point vortices , but finite size vortex patches . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case of two identical , radially symmetric vortex patches of size @xmath226 initially located at points @xmath839 with @xmath840 . under the time evolution defined by , the centers of the patches will rotate with approximatively constant angular velocity around the mid - point @xmath841 . to obtain a more precise description of the solution , we go to a rotating frame where the centers of the patches stay fixed , and we concentrate on the deformations of the vortex cores .",
    "what is observed in numerical simulations @xcite is that the interaction begins with a fast relaxation process , during which each vortex adapts its shape to the velocity field generated by the other vortex .",
    "this first step depends on the details of the initial data , and is characterized by temporal oscillations of the vortex cores which disappear on a non - viscous time scale . in a second step ,",
    "the vortices relax to a gaussian - like profile at a diffusive rate , and the system reaches a `` metastable state '' which is independent of the initial data , and will persist until two vortices get sufficiently close to start a merging process . in this metastable regime , the vortex centers move in the plane according to the helmholtz - kirchhoff dynamics , and the vortex profiles are uniquely determined , up to a scaling factor , by the relative positions of the centers .",
    "this is exactly the situation described by proposition  [ propfinal ] .",
    "in fact , if we start with point vortices , the system is immediately in the metastable state which , for more general initial data , is reached only after the transients steps described above . in this sense",
    ", point vortices can be considered as _ well - prepared initial data _ for the vortex interaction problem .      in this final section ,",
    "we briefly indicate how to construct an asymptotic expansion of the viscous @xmath4-vortex solution and to control the error terms .",
    "we first write the evolution equation satisfied by the rescaled vorticity profiles defined in .",
    "since @xmath842 for @xmath843 , where @xmath844 , we obtain @xmath845 where @xmath402 is the linear operator .",
    "the left - hand side is clearly singular in the limit @xmath756 , but this difficulty can be partially eliminated by an appropriate choice of the speeds @xmath846 . to this purpose , we set @xmath847 where @xmath818 and @xmath291 is the velocity profile defined in .",
    "this is a viscous approximation of the original point vortex system , which has its own interest and was recently studied in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  2 ) that the solutions of stay extremely close to those of in our perturbative regime where the vortices are widely separated from each other . in",
    "what follows , we thus make no distinction between the solutions of and .",
    "as was already mentioned , we expect the gaussian function @xmath290 to represent the leading order approximation of each vorticity profile .",
    "substituting @xmath290 for @xmath806 in the evolution equation above , and using together with @xmath848 , we obtain the following expression for the residuum of this naive approximation : @xmath849 this expression is not singular in the limit @xmath756 , and a direct calculation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) ) yields the asymptotic expansion @xmath850 for all @xmath406 and all @xmath218 $ ] , where @xmath851 moreover , given any @xmath852 , the last term @xmath853 in can be estimated as follows : @xmath854    the formula shows in particular that @xmath855 as @xmath756 .",
    "thus , if we decompose @xmath856 , the equation for @xmath857 will contain a source term of size @xmath858 as @xmath756 , and we therefore expect that the remainder @xmath857 itself will be of size @xmath858 after a short time .",
    "but , as is easily verified , the equation for @xmath857 contains nonlinear terms involving negative powers of @xmath755 , and such terms can not be controlled in the vanishing viscosity limit if @xmath857 is @xmath858 .",
    "this is the reason why it is necessary to construct a more precise approximate solution of our vorticity profiles , in order to `` desingularize '' the equation for the remainder .    to this end , we first consider approximate solutions of the form @xmath859 where @xmath860 are smooth vorticity profiles to be determined , and the corresponding velocity profiles @xmath861 are obtained via the biot - savart law .",
    "the residuum of this improved approximation can be computed @xcite , and has the form @xmath862 where @xmath547 is the linear operator defined in . to minimize the residuum",
    ", we want to choose @xmath863 so as to satisfy the linear equation @xmath864 .",
    "this is indeed possible , because @xmath865 belongs to the schwartz class @xmath866 and to the subspace @xmath867 , see , and it is shown in @xcite that @xmath868 .",
    "the equation @xmath864 has therefore a unique solution in @xmath869 , which coincides with the leading term in the expression of @xmath816 .",
    "note however that the equation above determines @xmath863 only up to an element of @xmath695 . as a matter of fact",
    ", in , a radially symmetric correction @xmath814 is added to @xmath816 in order to compensate for higher order terms ( which will not be considered here ) . in any case , we can choose @xmath863 in such a way that @xmath870 .",
    "following the same procedure , we next construct a higher order approximate solution of the form @xmath871 again , the vorticity profiles @xmath863 , @xmath872 , and @xmath873 are obtained by solving under - determined linear equations involving the operator @xmath547 . more precisely , we have @xmath864 and @xmath874 , but the equation for @xmath873 is more complicated .",
    "the residuum of that approximation now satisfies @xmath875    finally , once the approximate solution has been constructed , we decompose the vorticity profiles as follows : @xmath876 and we consider the evolution system satisfied by the remainder @xmath857 , @xmath877 .",
