    "tevatron run i has been a great success for high energy physics . for the period between october 1992 and february 1996 ,",
    "about @xmath0 of data were collected by the two competing experiments and collaborations : cdf and d .",
    "both collaborations have made many important measurements and discoveries with their powerful and multi - purpose detectors@xcite , culminated by the discovery of the top quark in 1995 .",
    "they are also engaged in search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . though no convincing evidence of new physics was found ,",
    "the searches have extended our understanding of the fundamentals of the universe and have led our quest for ultimate understanding in a concerted direction .    this paper reports nine results on searches for new physics conducted recently at the tevatron by cdf and d .",
    "we cover the topics of susy , large extra dimension , leptoquark , and model independent searches .",
    "minimal supergravity or msugra@xcite is a model which provides a framework for the spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry@xcite . in this model ,",
    "susy is broken in the hidden sector of the theory and this breaking is communicated to the physical sector of the theory through gravitational interactions .",
    "there are five parameters to completely determine the susy sector of the theory :    * @xmath1 : common scalar particle mass at the susy breaking scale @xmath2 is usually the gut scale ( @xmath3 ) or the planck scale ( @xmath4 ) . ] ; * @xmath5 : common gaugino mass at the @xmath2 scale ; * @xmath6 : common trilinear coupling at the @xmath2 scale ; * @xmath7 : ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ; * @xmath8 : @xmath9 is the higgsino mass parameter .    an additional parameter called r - parity is introduced and is defined as : @xmath10@xcite , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are baryon and lepton numbers , respectively , and @xmath13 refers to spin . a superpotential for mssm , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model@xcite , can be written as the following :    @xmath14    where the first line describes @xmath15-conserving couplings and the second line describes @xmath15-violating couplings ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are @xmath19 yukawa coupling matrices ; @xmath20 and @xmath12 are left - handed quark and lepton supermultiplets , respectively ; @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the right - handed singlets of the up and down type ( s)quarks and ( s)leptons , respectively ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the two higgs doublets ; @xmath9 is the higgsino mass parameter ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the coupling strengths for lepton number violating interactions and @xmath29 is the coupling strength for baryon number violating interactions .",
    "we describe in this paper four searches for msugra under various additional constraints .      in this analysis",
    ", we assume that stop pair are produced through @xmath15-conserving processes and then decay through @xmath15-violating process : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are leptonically and hadronically decayed @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we also assume that @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : superpotential ] ) dominates the couplings .",
    "the key to this analysis is the identification of @xmath32 .",
    "the following criteria are used to select @xmath32 :    * @xmath32 candidates are clusters with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; * number of tracks and @xmath37 s in a narrow cone around a @xmath33 cluster candidate are consistent with those coming from a @xmath33 ; * @xmath38 and isolation energy of tracks and reconstructed @xmath39 mass are consistent with those of a @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rpv_stop_echan_tau_ntracks ] shows the number of tracks in a @xmath33 cone .",
    "the 1-prong and 3-prong structures of the @xmath33 candidates are prominent .",
    "a total of @xmath40 of data are used in this analysis .",
    "the major sm backgrounds come from @xmath41 , diboson , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and multijet events .",
    "the first two are physics backgrounds which have the same final states as the signal while the rest are @xmath33 fakes of by jets .",
    "leptonically decayed @xmath31 is identified with a tagging electron or muon .",
    "we require @xmath44 , @xmath45 for the electron channel or @xmath46 , @xmath47 for the muon channel . in order to increase the signal significance ,",
    "the following additional selection cuts are applied :    * transverse mass of the lepton and the : @xmath48 ; * the scalar sum of @xmath49 of the lepton , @xmath32 , and : @xmath50 ; * @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the distribution of these variables are shown in figure  [ fig : rpv_stop_echan ] .",
    "[ h!tb ]    the results after the cuts are shown in table  [ tbl : rpv_stop_result ] . since no signal is found in our data .",
    "we set the signal limit in terms of @xmath53 , the production cross section of @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "the limits are shown in figure  [ fig : rpv_stop_combined_limit ] . from the figure",
    ", we set the 95% c.l .",
    "limit on stop mass : @xmath56 .",
    "the previous limit from aleph collaboration is @xmath57@xcite .",
    "[ h!tb ]    0.1 in    ._number of expected background events @xmath58 , observed events @xmath59 in data and the expected total signal efficiency ( for @xmath60 ) after all the cuts in search for rpv msugra in decays of stop pair are applied .",

    "the data sets are categorized according to their final states .",
    "the backgrounds and their respective fractions have been calculated and are available to the user .",
    "it is understood that the data are well explained by the expected background and that the goal of the analysis is to set @xmath61 , the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit , on the cross section of the model . at the quaero web page , http://quaero.fnal.gov",
    ", users can use pythia@xcite to generate their model events which results in one of the available final states .",
    "they can then define a variable set @xmath62 to be used to optimize the search .",
    "the optimization algorithm has the following steps :    * kernel density estimation@xcite is used to obtain a signal and background probability distribution @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively ; * a discriminant function is defined as@xcite : @xmath65 * the sensitivity @xmath13 is defined as the reciprocal of @xmath66 , which is the 95% c.l . limit on model cross section as a function of @xmath67 on @xmath68 .",
    "an optimal @xmath67 on @xmath68 is chosen to minimize @xmath66 , thus maximize @xmath13 ; * the region of variable space having @xmath69 is used to determine the actual 95% c.l .",
    "cross section upper limit @xmath61 .    based on run 1 data ,",
    "quaero has set @xmath61 for various models , including sm higgs production : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ; @xmath74 and @xmath75 production : @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; and leptoquark production : @xmath78 .",
    "we have presented in this paper nine analyses which were finalized in year 2001 . even though we did not observe any signature of new physics , we are able to set stronger limits on them . new tools and techniques",
    "have been developed to equip us for more challenging searches . with more powerful detectors for both cdf and d , and an order of magnitude of increase in luminosity for expected for run 2",
    ", we are looking forward to more exciting searches and possibly discoveries .",
    "the author is thankful to both cdf and d  collaborations for the opportunity to present these new results at la  thuile 2002. in particular the author would like to thank the following persons who actually carried out the analyses and provided the detail information : abdelouahab  abdesselam , sudeshna  banerjee , and hai  zheng of the dcollaboration , and david  gerdes , chris  hays , teruki  kamon , minjeong  kim , bruce  knuteson , yoshiyuki  miyazaki , simona  murgia , peter  onyisi , and masashi  tanaka of the cdf collaboration ."
