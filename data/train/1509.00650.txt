    "meta - analysis is a widely applicable approach to combine information from different studies about a common effect of interest .",
    "a popular framework for accounting for the heterogeneity between studies is the random - effects specification in @xcite .",
    "there is ample evidence that frequentist inference for this specification can result in misleading conclusions , especially if inference is carried out by relying on first - order asymptotic arguments in the common setting of small or moderate number of studies ( e.  g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same considerations apply to the random - effects meta - regression model , which is a direct extension of random - effects meta - analysis allowing for study - specific covariates .",
    "proposals that have been presented to account for the finite number of studies include modification of the limiting distribution of test statistics @xcite , restricted maximum likelihood @xcite and second - order asymptotics @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested a double resampling approach that outperforms several alternatives in terms of empirical coverage probability of confidence intervals for the mean effect size .",
    "the current paper studies the extent of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator of the random - effect variance and introduces a bias - reducing penalized likelihood that yields a substantial improvement in the estimation of the random - effect variance .",
    "the bias - reducing penalized likelihood is closely related to the approximate conditional likelihood of @xcite and the restricted maximum likelihood for inference about the random - effects variance .",
    "in addition , the associated penalized deviance can be directly used for inference about the fixed - effect parameters .",
    "real - data examples and two thorough simulation studies illustrate the improvement in finite - sample performance against alternatives from the recent literature .",
    "suppose there are @xmath0 studies about a common effect of interest , each of them providing pairs of summary measures @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the study - specific estimate of the effect , and @xmath3 is the associated estimation variance @xmath4 . in some situations , the pairs @xmath1 may be accompanied by study - specific covariates @xmath5 , which describe the heterogeneity across studies . in the meta - analysis literature",
    ", it is usually assumed that the within - study variances @xmath3 are estimated well enough to be considered as known and equal to the values reported in each study . under this assumption",
    ", the random - effects meta - regression model postulates that i ) @xmath6 are realizations of random variables @xmath7 , respectively , which are independent conditionally on independent random effects @xmath8 ; ii ) the conditional distribution of @xmath9 given @xmath10 is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an unknown @xmath13-vector of effects .",
    "we use the random - effects meta - regression model as a working model for theoretical development , and in  4 , we illustrate the good performance of the derived procedures under a more realistic scenario that deviates from the working model @xcite .    typically , @xmath14 and the random effect @xmath15 is assumed to be distributed according to @xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath18 accounts for the between - study heterogeneity . in matrix notation , and conditionally on @xmath19 , the random - effects meta - regression model is @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the model matrix of dimension @xmath23 with @xmath24 in its @xmath25th row , and @xmath26 is a vector of independent errors each with a @xmath27 distribution . under this specification ,",
    "the marginal distribution of @xmath28 is multivariate normal with mean @xmath29 and variance @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 identity matrix and @xmath33 .",
    "the random - effects meta - analysis model is a meta - regression model where @xmath22 is a column of ones .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is naturally estimated by weighted least squares as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "then , inference about @xmath12 can be based on the fact that under model  ( [ eq : metaregression ] ) , @xmath36 has an asymptotic normal distribution with mean @xmath12 and variance @xmath37 . in this case , the reliability of the associated inferential procedures critically depends on the availability of an accurate estimate of the between - study variance @xmath18 .",
    "a popular choice is the @xcite estimator @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the cochran statistic , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite presents evidence on the loss of efficiency of @xmath42 , which can impact inference ; see , also , @xcite .",

    "the log - likelihood function for @xmath43 in model  ( [ eq : metaregression ] ) is @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the determinant of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "a calculation of the gradient @xmath48 of @xmath49 shows that the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath50 for @xmath51 results from solving the equations @xmath52= 0 \\ , , \\\\",

    "[ sec : bias ] from the results in @xcite , the first term in the expansion of the bias function of the maximum likelihood estimator is found to be @xmath57 , where @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "a sketch derivation for ( [ eq : bias_tau2 ] ) is given in the appendix .",
    "in what follows @xmath60 is called the first - order bias .",
    "the non - zero entries of @xmath46 and the diagonal entries of @xmath61 are all necessarily positive , so the maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath18 is subject to downwards bias , which , as is also noted in @xcite , affects inference about @xmath12 , by over - estimating the non - zero entries of @xmath46 , and hence , over - estimating the information matrix @xmath62 \\,.\\ ] ] this over - estimation of @xmath63 can result in hypothesis tests with large type i error and confidence intervals or regions with actual coverage appreciably lower than the nominal level .",
    "an estimator that corrects for the first - order bias of @xmath64 results from solving the adjusted score equations @xmath65 @xcite . a substitution of ( [ eq : scores ] ) , ( [ eq : bias_tau2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fisherinfo ] ) in the expression for @xmath66 gives that the adjusted score functions for @xmath12 and @xmath18 are @xmath67 and @xmath68= 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the expression for the differential of the log - determinant can be used to show that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the derivatives of the penalized log - likelihood function @xmath71 where @xmath49 is as in ( [ eq : loglikelihood ] ) , @xmath72 is the @xmath12-block of the information matrix @xmath63 , and @xmath73 denotes determinant .",
    "so , the solution of the adjusted score equations is the maximum penalized likelihood estimator @xmath74 .    for @xmath75 , expression  ( [ eq : penloglik ] ) reduces to both the logarithm of the approximate conditional likelihood of @xcite for inference about @xmath18 , when @xmath12 is treated as a nuisance component , and to the restricted log - likelihood function of @xcite . hence",
    ", maximising the bias - reducing penalized log - likelihood ( [ eq : penloglik ] ) is equivalent to calculating the maximum restricted likelihood estimator for @xmath18 .",
    "the latter estimator has originally been constructed to reduce underestimation of variance components in finite samples as a consequence of failing to account for the degrees of freedom that are involved in the estimation of the fixed effects @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown the equivalence of the restricted log - likelihood with approximate conditional likelihood in the more general context of inference about variance components in normal linear mixed models .      given a starting value @xmath76 for @xmath18 ,",
    "the following iterative process has a stationary point that maximizes ( [ eq : penloglik ] ) . at the @xmath77th iteration @xmath78 , a new candidate value @xmath79 for @xmath12",
    "is obtained as the weighted least squares estimator ( [ eq : betahat ] ) at @xmath80 ; a candidate value for @xmath81 is then computed by a line search for solving the adjusted score equation ( [ eq : adjustedpsi ] ) evaluated at @xmath82 . the iteration is repeated until either the candidate values do not change across iterations or the adjusted score functions are sufficiently close to zero .",
    "the profile penalized likelihood function can be used to construct confidence intervals and regions , and carry out hypothesis tests for @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath83 , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the estimators of @xmath86 and @xmath18 , respectively , from maximising ( [ eq : penloglik ] ) for fixed @xmath87 , then the penalized deviance @xmath88 has the usual limiting @xmath89 distribution , where @xmath90 . to derive this limiting result , note that the adjustment to the scores in ( [ eq : scores ] ) is additive and @xmath91 , so the extra terms depending on it and its derivatives in the asymptotic expansion of the penalized likelihood disappear as information increases .",
    "the impact of using the penalized likelihood for estimation and inference in random - effects meta - analysis and meta - regression is more profound for a small to moderate number of studies .",
    "as the number of studies increases , the log - likelihood derivatives dominate the bias - reducing adjustment in ( [ eq : adjustedpsi ] ) in terms of asymptotic order , and , inference the penalized likelihood becomes indistinguishable from likelihood inference .",
    "in  [ sect : simu ] , the performance of penalized likelihood inference is compared with that of alternative methods using simulation studies under the random - effects meta - analysis model ( [ eq : metaregression ] ) , and under a more realistic model for individual - within - study data .",

    "the profile penalized likelihood confidence interval has empirical coverage that is appreciably closer to the nominal level than double resampling .",
    "figure [ fig : coverages1 ] also includes results for two alternative confidence intervals .",
    "the first uses the classical dersimonian & laird estimator @xmath103 and its estimated variance @xmath104 .",
    "not surprisingly , the empirical coverage of this confidence interval is grossly smaller than the nominal confidence level .",
    "the second interval is used for reference and results by the numerical inversion of skovgaard s statistic , which is designed to produce second - order accurate p - values for tests on the mean effect size @xcite .",
    "the profile penalized likelihood interval has comparable performance to the one based on skovgaard s statistic , with the latter having empirical coverage slightly closer to the nominal level for a wider range of values for @xmath18 . in general , though , the numerical inversion of skovgaard s statistic can be unstable due to the discontinuity of the statistic around the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "in contrast , the calculation of profile penalized likelihood intervals is not prone to such instabilities .",
    "the penalized likelihood also results in a bias - reduced estimator of @xmath18 , whose reliable estimation is often of interest in medical studies @xcite .      the profile penalized likelihood and all other methods in figure  [ fig : coverages1 ] have been developed under the validity of the random - effects meta - analysis model .",
