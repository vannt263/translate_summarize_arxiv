    "semiconductor microcavities ( mc ) with embedded quantum wells have found a growing interest in recent years .",
    "the eigenstates of the systems as a result of the strong coupling between the mc photon and quantum well exciton at the same in - plane wave vector are called cavity polaritons . the rabi splitting and the dispersion of these cavity polaritons",
    "are readily observable using reflection , absorption , photoluminescence measurements [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "recently , many new phenomena have been intensely studied in mc : super - linear behaviour in emission intensity [ 4 - 6 ] , stimulated polariton amplifier [ 7 - 8 ] and suppression of the relaxation bottleneck @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "tartakovski et al .",
    "@xcite were the only group , which has clearly observed this suppression of the relaxation bottleneck of lower polariton states at higher powers .",
    "in this work , we study the relaxation kinetics of cavity polaritons by scattering with thermal acoustic phonons . here",
    "we will present numerical solutions of the rate equations and show that a suppression of the bottleneck occurs at sufficiently high concentration of the polaritons .",
    "within the two - coupled band model and considering only the 1s state of the heavy - hole quantum well exciton , the energy for the upper and lower cavity polariton branches is given by the usual solutions of the polariton dispersion equations as given in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the fundamental exciton energy , @xmath3 the electron ( hole ) in - plane mass , @xmath4 the cavity refraction index , @xmath5 the rabi splitting .",
    "1 shows the cavity polariton dispersion of gaas quantum wells embedded in cavity for a detuning @xmath6 mev , a rabi splitting @xmath7 mev , and @xmath8 .    in the following we will use the semi - classical boltzmann kinetics to investigate the cavity polariton relaxation by acoustic phonon scattering . the rate equation for the distribution @xmath9 of branch i with the in - plane wave vector k and energy @xmath10 of the cavity polariton can be written as [ 10 - 11 ] @xmath11+g^i_k(t )    \\label{reqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 is the radiative recombination rate and @xmath13 the generation rate .",
    "the transition rates @xmath14 due to deformation potential scattering are weighted with exciton hopfield coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18^{3/2}}\\   .\\label{f1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is quantum well width , v the sample volume , u the longitudinal sound velocity , @xmath20 the mass density of the solid , @xmath21 and @xmath22 the deformation potentials .",
    "a(x ) and g(x ) are the fourier transform of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "note that the 1s exciton wave function has been taken in the simplest form @xmath25 expression ( [ trans.rate ] ) contains transition rate due to the absorption of phonon @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and due to emission of phonon @xmath28 for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the thermal phonon distribution function .    in the following we will present the results of the cavity polariton kinetics on the lower branch assuming an isotropic distribution of polaritons in k space . for the decay rate @xmath12",
    ", we use the same approximation given by bloch and marzin in gaas quantum well @xcite : @xmath31 for @xmath32 ; @xmath33 for @xmath34 ; and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the radiative life of photon and exciton , respectively , @xmath39 the photon hopfield coefficient ) .",
    "in this section , rate equations are numerically integrated using the following parameters for mc with embedded gaas quantum wells : [ 12 - 13 ] @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 . concerning the generation rate",
    "we choose for @xmath42 a gausian distribution of exciton on the lower branch with a width @xmath43 centered at a momentum @xmath44 and @xmath45 with @xmath46 . unless otherwise stated we will choose @xmath47 , @xmath48 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the distribution function @xmath49 of cavity polaritons on the lower branch for a rather long radiative photon decay time @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "we clearly see the presence of the bottleneck effect similar to the bulk case [ 15 - 16 ] .",
    "however , if we increase the pump intensity , a suppression of the bottleneck occurs as can be clearly seen in fig . 3 at @xmath52 .",
    "these findings agree rather well with recent measurements performed in gaas cavity by tartakovski et al .",
    "@xcite using nonresonant cw laser excitation .",
    "they found that the bottleneck has been strongly suppressed at higher power laser excitation .",
    "this feature is specific for cavity polaritons .",
    "we have also carried out the calculations for the ortho - exciton polaritons in bulk @xmath53 @xcite and have found that the bottleneck persists up to very high density around @xmath54.the main difference in the dispersion relation between cavity polaritons and bulk polaritons is the slope of @xmath55 versus k in the bottleneck k - region .",
    "the very high value of the slope of the bulk polaritons ( 70 times higher than the slope of the cavity polaritons ) is very unfavorable for the suppression of the bottleneck even at very high densities . on the other hand",
    ", one can lower the slope in the cavity polaritons by decreasing the absolute value of the negative detuning @xmath56 . from expression ( [ f2 ] ) of @xmath57 we can see that the scattering rate is roughly proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , quantum wells with thin width will be favorable for the suppression of the bottleneck . for @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "the bottleneck starts to be suppressed at densities , which are roughly 3 time lower than those for @xmath61 and @xmath50 . for a more realistic @xmath62",
    "one needs a higher density to compensate the fast decay of the photon - like polaritons .",
    "recently , senellart and bloch have given the photon decay time @xmath62 a value of @xmath63 @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 we display the integrated distribution function @xmath64 versus the wave number k for different polariton densities for @xmath65 , @xmath66 at 2k ( fig .",
    "4a ) and 15k ( fig .",
    "these results show a clear process of the relaxation kinetics : a nonlinear increase of low k cavity polaritons with increasing polariton densities ( or excitation laser powers ) leads to the suppression of the bottleneck .",
    "the suppression is slightly more favorable at t=15 k. for density @xmath67 , one should take into account the exciton - exciton scattering and also go beyond the rate equation approximation .",
    "however , we expect our results remain qualitatively valid even in a better treatment of polariton relaxation kinetics .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented detailed cavity polariton relaxation kinetics of lower branch due to deformation potential scattering by accoustic phonons . in agreement with recent experimental results by tartakovski et al .",
    "@xcite we found that suppression of the bottleneck is found at high polariton densities .",
