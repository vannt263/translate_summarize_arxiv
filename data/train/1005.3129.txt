    "ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices have been a topic of active research for about a decade now .",

    ", one can seamlessly drive a system through quantum phase transitions like the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "in so - called two - color superlattices , additional lasers are used to introduce irregular lattice topologies which give rise to exotic quantum phases like the bose - glass phase @xcite .",
    "strongly correlated particles in periodic potentials are well described by hubbard - type models .",
    "together with powerful many - body methods this allows for theoretical studies of the phase diagram of ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "however , a one - to - one comparison between experiment and theory has rarely been done so far because these theoretical studies usually adopt the generic parameters of the hubbard model to span the phase diagram .",
    "such a phase diagram of ultracold bosonic atoms in a two - color superlattice is shown in fig .  [ comparepic](a ) .    in this work",
    "we establish a closer link to experiments by computing the phase diagrams with respect to the natural experimental control parameters , which are the intensities ( @xmath1 ) of the two lasers generating the one - dimensional optical superlattice . such an experiment - specific phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ comparepic](b ) . in order to predict this type of phase diagram we start with single - particle band structure calculations to extract the hubbard parameters for a specific experimental setup .",
    "then , the many - body problem is solved using the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) algorithm . in the following ,",
    "our band structure plus dmrg approach is introduced and benchmarked .",
    "we discuss the phase diagram of a specific experimental setup motivated by refs .",

    "the phase diagrams spanned directly by these parameters , typically using @xmath13 , @xmath14 and some ansatz for @xmath12 to account for superlattice structures , are extensively discussed in refs .",
    "more recently , the on - site energies @xmath12 were calculated directly from the parameters of the optical superlattice to provide a closer connection to experiment @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is a discussion of the phase diagram using the experimental parameters directly and not the generic hubbard parameters . to this end ,",
    "an explicit treatment of the underlying single - particle physics is necessary .",
