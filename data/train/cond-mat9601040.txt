    "in two dimensions the superconducting transition in zero magnetic field is a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "@xcite this has been verified over the years in both experiments @xcite and in many models of superconductors like the xy , villain , and coulomb gas models @xcite .",
    "the important degrees of freedom in a system undergoing a kosterlitz - thouless transition are thermally excited vortex pairs .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition is sometimes also referred to as a vortex unbinding transition , as for temperatures below the transition temperature @xmath2 all vortices are bound in neutral pairs .",
    "these pairs start to unbind at and above @xmath2 .",
    "a typical way to look for a kosterlitz - thouless transition in experiments on thin superconducting films is to probe the current - voltage ( iv ) characteristic @xcite . both the linear and the nonlinear iv characteristics have specific fingerprints identifying a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "vortices determine the iv characteristic for the following reasons : if a vortex is dragged across the system a voltage is induced .",
    "hence resistance is zero only if there are no vortices available to move across the system , and only then the system is truly superconducting .",
    "vortices that are bound in neutral pairs are unable to move freely and to cause dissipation .",
    "however an external applied in - plane supercurrent yields a perpendicular lorentz force acting in opposite direction on vortices with different vorticity .",
    "this gives a net flux of vortices across the system , which shows up as nonlinear ( i.e.  current dependent ) resistance .",
    "below the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature all vortices are bound in neutral pairs by the logarithmic vortex interaction , and the linear resistance is thus zero .",
    "therefore the system superconducts below the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "the linear resistance drops to zero at the kosterlitz - thouless transition with an exponential functional form , @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with experiments , although the logarithm is a complication for quantitative comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "a finite applied current gives a power - law nonlinear iv characteristic of the form @xmath5 .",
    "the critical current is thus zero . at the kosterlitz - thouless transition",
    "the iv exponent @xmath0 assumes the universal value 2 , so @xmath6 at @xmath7 . for @xmath8 one",
    "has @xmath9 , and for @xmath10 one has @xmath11",
    "( for small enough currents ) @xcite .",
    "experiments on , for example , thin hg - xe alloy films @xcite and also for certain single crystal high temperature superconductors @xcite , among some , have confirmed this .",
    "since iv characteristics are hard to calculate analytically computer simulation is a useful tool .",
    "iv characteristics of vortex systems have recently been calculated successfully with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "linear and nonlinear iv characteristics of vortex glass superconductors have been reported in refs .  .",
    "in a recent monte carlo simulation of the coulomb gas the linear resistance was used to locate the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear iv characteristics at the kosterlitz - thouless transition has been calculated in ref .  , and a finite - size scaling analysis accurately verified the relation @xmath6 at the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "in this paper we study the iv characteristics of a lattice coulomb gas model by monte carlo simulations of vortex dynamics .",
    "we calculate the iv exponent @xmath0 of the coulomb gas in three different ways : ( 1 ) by direct monte carlo calculation of the nonlinear resistance , ( 2 ) by a self consistent linear screening construction for the energy barrier for current induced vortex - pair breaking giving thermally activated resistance , and ( 3 ) by a finite scaling construction from data for the linear resistance .",
    "all methods are based on monte carlo simulations , and we apply both equilibrium and non - equilibrium simulations .",
    "these three methods give the same results , giving us a consistent and simple picture of nonequilibrium response in this system .",
    "furthermore , we compare our results for @xmath0 with experiments .",
    "scaling arguments give that @xmath0 is a universal scaling function of a reduced coulomb gas temperature @xmath12 , and this is verified in experiments @xcite .",
    "we find close agreement between our monte carlo results and the experimental universal scaling curve , and this comparison appears to be presented here for the first time .",
    "the agreement between different methods , and between our simulations and experiments , are the main results of our paper .",
    "some of our monte carlo results for the nonlinear iv characteristics have been obtained previously @xcite , as explained above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the lattice coulomb gas model . in section iii",
    "we study various approaches to the iv characteristics . in section",
    "iv we describe our monte carlo methods for calculating iv characteristics . in section",

    "section vi contains discussion and conclusions .",
    "a useful starting point for calculations with superconductors in the presense of currents and fields is the ginsburg - landau model , with the order parameter @xmath13 describing the superconducting order of the system .",
    "however , this model does not focus particularly on vortex degrees of freedom .",
    "the vortices constitute the essential degrees of freedom near the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "an approximation to the ginsburg - landau model which focuses only on the vortices is given by the coulomb gas model . here",
    "thermal fluctuations in the magnitude of @xmath14 are neglected , since they are relevant only close to the mean - field transition temperature , which is assumed to be well above the vortex transition temperature @xmath2 . in our simulations",
    "the model is discretized and put on a lattice .",
    "the approximation made in the lattice discretization will only affect the short range behavior of the vortices , as the lattice defines the smallest possible separation .",
    "the critical properties will however not be effected . in general , large length scale properties",
    "should be reasonable modeled by the lattice coulomb gas close to @xmath2 .",

    "the above definition does not include any net currents .",
    "how to include them and to calculate iv characteristics by monte carlo simulation is described in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss various aspects and approaches to the current - voltage characteristics of 2d superconductors close to the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "a basic experiment on a superconductor is to measure the linear resistance .",
    "such measurements on thin films of both conventional low-@xmath2 superconductors @xcite and single crystal high-@xmath2 materials @xcite , have been successfully interpreted in terms of thermally excited vortex fluctuations analyzed by use of the coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "the linear resistivity is defined by @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the applied supercurrent density and @xmath33 is the resulting induced electric field .",
    "some words about notation : since resistance and resistivity have the same dimension in two dimensions and our system is homogeneous , they are the same , and they we will both be denoted by @xmath34 . @xmath34 will be reserved for linear resistance , and will not be used to denote nonlinear resistance .",
    "an applied supercurrent is denoted by @xmath35 , and voltage is @xmath36 .    to determine the linear resistance in simulations of the coulomb gas from @xmath37 for small @xmath32 has its limitations , as we have to repeat the calculation at a sequence of current densities @xmath32 , to make sure that @xmath32 is small enough to be in the linear regime .",
    "if the purpose is to measure only the linear resistance , and not @xmath33 as function of @xmath32 , a different approach is to use the nyquist formula  @xcite , which relates the linear resistance to the equilibrium voltage fluctuations : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the induced voltage from vortex motion at time @xmath40 . as an alternative to eq .",
    "[ nyquist ] the kubo formula for the vortex currents @xmath41 , @xmath42 can be used .",
    "given the josephson relation we see immediately that the kubo formula equals the nyquist relation .",
    "the linear resistance has been successfully used in a simulation @xcite to locate the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath2 of the 2d lattice coulomb gas .",
    "they find the finite size scaling relation at @xmath2 : @xmath43 to be valid to a very high precision .",
    "the scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ logcorrection ] ) was derived from the following argument .",
    "we assume the dynamical exponent @xmath44 for free vortex diffusion in two dimensions @xcite .",

    "( [ logcorrection ] ) .",
    "this correction is readily obtained from the corresponding correction terms for @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the above scaling argument led to a finite size scaling formula which is useful for locating the transition temperature from monte carlo data for the resistance of finite samples . here",
    "we will do a more detailed analysis that will also lead to the same formula .",
    "the analysis here does not directly involve scaling arguments , but considers the interactions between vortices in the coulomb gas .",
    "the analysis will give expressions for the resistance from thermally activated free vortices in the coulomb gas in the presence of an applied supercurrent .",
    "this more detailed analysis will be useful in later sections when we analyze monte carlo data for the coulomb gas .    according to the josephson relation the voltage @xmath53 caused by vortex motion is @xmath54 where we assume that the resistance is proportional to the density of `` free '' vortices , @xmath55 , defined by the the debye - hckel relation . the linear resistance @xmath34 is defined by the limit of zero current @xmath56 : @xmath57 to make an estimate of the density of free vortices we proceed by the following simple model .",

    "a careful inspection of the scaling at temperatures @xmath160 and @xmath186 reveals that the order of the lattices sizes is reversed for @xmath160 compared with the higher temperatures .",

    "we find that the scaling exponent @xmath109 to a high degree of accuracy fits the direct determined @xmath111 for a broad range of temperatures .",
    "this provides a link between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium response properties of the system : a finite mesoscopic linear resistance in a finite sample below @xmath2 is due to thermally activated vortex motion across some potential barrier , generated by interactions with all other vortices in the system .",
    "when a finite current is imposed across the system , new nonequilibrium configurations are accessed where vortices are driven away from their equilibrium positions by the finite lorentz force , thus giving nonlinear response .",
    "our data shows that the barrier overcome by the lorentz force , giving nonlinear response , is essentially the same barrier as in the equilibrium case , i.e. , the potential barrier in the case of a finite current appears to be determined by equilibrium states in the system .",
    "this is consistent with the scaling ansatz , discussed above , of a certain current length scale ( @xmath100 ) associated with the finite current , such that for lengths shorter than the current length scale an equilibrium state is still attained , which gives a potential barrier essentially equal to that in the equilibrium case .",
    "an interesting possibility arises here to measure finite size effects on the linear resistance in lithographic josephson junction arrays .",
    "the idea would here to take advantage of finite size roundings , rather than as usual want them to be as small as possible , and trying to fit experimental data on very small arrays to our finite size scaling formulas .",
    "this would provide an unusual experimental test of finite size scaling .",
    "it is also important to analyze the data in terms of the reduced temperature scale , as @xmath2 is sample dependent . according to eq .",
    "( [ rla ] ) it should be possible to scale the linear resistance of samples of different sizes onto a single scaling function using the exponent @xmath179 from the nonlinear iv characteristics .    our conclusions are : ( 1 ) simulation of nonequilibrium vortex dynamics allow calculation of a lattice size independent iv exponent @xmath0 as a function of temperature @xmath152 .",
    "( 2 ) this curve for @xmath0 agrees nicely with experiments in an interval around @xmath2 , and this appears to be reported here for the first time .",
    "( 3 ) this curve can be obtained from a simple phenomenological theory for the nonlinear iv characteristic .",
