    "some of the most interesting objects in our galaxy are close compact binary stars , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , low mass x - ray binaries , or double degenerate white dwarf ( wd ) binaries .",
    "the vast majority of close compact binaries form through common envelope ( ce ) evolution occurring when the more massive star of the initial main sequence binary fills its roche - lobe on the first giant branch ( fgb ) or on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "this may trigger dynamically unstable mass transfer causing the giant s envelope to engulf its core ( the future compact object ) and the main - sequence companion .",
    "drag forces transfer orbital energy and angular momentum from the binary orbit to the envelope , reducing the binary separation , until eventually the envelope is expelled and a short orbital period post - common envelope binary ( pceb ) consisting of a compact object and a main - sequence companion is exposed .    a commonly used method to predict the outcome of binary star evolution and to theoretically investigate close compact binary star populations are binary population synthesis ( bps ) studies which have been performed e.g. for supernova type ia progenitors @xcite , short gamma ray bursts @xcite , or galactic wd plus main sequence ( wdms ) binaries @xcite .",
    "however , in current bps models ce evolution is commonly approximated by a parametrized energy equation , i.e. a fraction of the available orbital energy , known as the ce efficiency ( @xmath4 ) , is equated to the binding energy of the envelope @xcite . while recent observational as well as theoretical results indicate rather small efficiencies for the use of orbital energy , i.e. @xmath5 @xcite , it remains unclear if , and to what extent , additional energy sources play an important role in unbinding the envelope .",
    "on the one hand , the long orbital period pceb ikpeg @xcite and perhaps also the two symbiotic systems tcrb @xcite and rsoph @xcite have been claimed to provide direct evidence for additional energy contributions @xcite and atomic recombination is often considered to be the most promising candidate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite argue that recombination energy can not significantly contribute to the ejection process as , according to them , the opacity in the envelope is too small and the energy provided by recombination should be radiated away rather than accelerating the gas .    during the last few years",
    "we have successfully identified a large number of pcebs among wdms binaries discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and measured the orbital periods of 58 systems @xcite .",
    "so far we have found not a single system providing additional direct evidence for recombination energy to be important . as a continuation of this large scale project , we here present orbital period measurements of the pcebs sdssj121130.94 - 024954.4 and sdssj222108.45 + 002927.7 ( hereafter sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 , see their sdss spectra in figure[f - spec ] ) and find these two systems to be the longest orbital period pcebs in our sample , and currently the second and third longest wdms pcebs known after ikpeg .",
    "we discuss the implications of these findings for theories of ce evolution with particular emphasis on the possible contributions of recombination energy to the energy budget of ce evolution .",
    "we start with a brief summary of the performed spectroscopic follow - up observations of sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 .",

    "the wd effective temperatures ( @xmath6 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath7 ) and masses ( @xmath8 ) , as well as the secondary star spectral types ( sp@xmath9 ) , masses and radii ( @xmath10 ) are obtained following the decomposition / fitting technique described in @xcite . in brief this routine follows a two - step procedure .",
    "first , the sdss spectrum is fitted with a two - component model , and the spectral type of the secondary star is determined ( figure[f - rdfits ] ) .",
    "second , the best - fit m - dwarf is subtracted and the residual wd spectrum is fitted with a model grid of da wds @xcite to determine the wd effective temperature and surface gravity ( figure[f - wdfits ] ) . from an empirical spectral type - radius - mass relation for",
    "m - dwarfs @xcite and a mass - radius relation for wds @xcite we then calculate the mass and radius of the secondary star and the wd respectively .    for the majority of sdss pcebs the spectroscopic decomposition results in an uncertainty of the spectral type of @xmath11 spectral classes @xcite , and",
    "this applies as well to sdssj2221 + 0029 .",
    "however , the sdss spectrum of sdssj1211 - 0249 suffers from low - frequency structure ( there is substantial structure left in the residual wd spectrum after the decomposition ) that results in a substantially larger uncertainty in the determination of the spectral type of the companion , and correspondingly larger uncertainties in the white dwarf parameters ( see left panels of figure[f - wdfits ] and table[t - param ] ) . for sdssj2221",

    "we have presented in the previous sections the discovery of the second and third longest orbital period ( detached ) pcebs containing a wd primary . in what follows",
    "we reconstruct the evolutionary history of both systems and discuss implications for our understanding of ce evolution .",
    "having at hand the orbital periods , the stellar mass estimates of both components and the wd effective temperatures allows us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 and predict their future following @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "first , we interpolate the cooling tracks of @xcite and @xcite to determine the cooling age of both systems .",
    "second , we derive the orbital period at the end of the ce phase using the the most up - to - date version of disrupted magnetic braking ( * ? ? ?",
    "* including the normalization provided by @xcite ) .",
    "third , we use the single - star evolution ( sse ) code of @xcite to reconstruct the ce phase for a given value of the ce efficiency and obtain the orbital and stellar parameters prior to ce evolution .",
    "we here follow @xcite and _ assume _ that recombination energy contributes to expelling the envelope with the same efficiency as the orbital energy ( given by @xmath32 ) and take into account the uncertainties in the stellar component masses and wd effective temperatures .",
    "we obtain solutions for rather large ranges of the ce efficiency for both systems that are given together with the resulting range of possible parameters and evolutionary time scales of the progenitor system in table[tab : reco ] .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , there seems to be some evidence for a relatively small ce efficiency and we therefore additionally provide the progenitor parameters assuming @xmath33 in table[tab : reco ] ( the uncertainties of the stellar masses and wd effective temperature are not considered here ) .",
    "this complements the results presented in @xcite ( their table3 ) .",
    "given that magnetic braking is not efficient in long orbital period systems , the current orbital periods ( table[t - param ] ) are nearly identical to those at the end of the ce phase .",
    "the masses of the reconstructed progenitors for both objects are similar , which is not surprising since the available estimates of the stellar masses are quite similar too .",
    "since the current orbital periods of sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 are very long for pcebs , the stellar components will not be close enough to trigger the second phase of mass transfer before the secondaries in both systems evolve away from the main sequence .",
    "both secondaries will therefore fill their roche lobes during the fgb transforming sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 into symbiotic systems with stable mass transfer from a red giant to a white dwarf .",

    "since the writing of this review , the energy equation of ce evolution in general , and especially the potential importance of recombination energy , has been a matter of debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the previous section we reconstructed the evolution of the long orbital period pcebs sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 _ assuming _ that recombination energy contributes to expelling the envelope with the same efficiency as the orbital energy and found large ranges of possible solutions .",
    "here we investigate whether this assumed additional energy is a necessary ingredient to understand the evolutionary history of sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 . to that end",
    "we now reconstruct the ce phase of both systems without considering recombination energy . taking into account the uncertainty of the measured stellar parameters , we find possible progenitors for both systems without violating energy conservation , i.e. @xmath44 for sdssj1211 - 0249 and @xmath45 for sdssj2221 + 0029 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the existence of the two systems does not confirm or disprove whether recombination ( or any other additional ) energy plays an important role during the ce phase .",
    "however , the current configuration of sdssj2221 + 0029 can only be explained if a relatively large fraction of the released orbital energy contributes to envelope ejection , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "this value exceeds the estimates given in recent studies of ce evolution that seem to converge towards a ce efficiency of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "if this is generally true , at least a small fraction of recombination energy ( or any other form of additional energy ) seems to have contributed to the envelope ejection in sdssj2221 + 0029 .",
    "although this interpretation appears tempting , the fact remains that not a single pceb within the homogeneous sdss sample @xcite provides _ direct _ evidence for additional sources of energy playing a role during ce evolution .",
    "ikpeg has been highlighted as a key object as it is the longest orbital period system and contains the most massive secondary star among the known pcebs containing a white dwarf primary .",
    "ik peg requires extra energy that helps to expel the envelope during ce evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , ikpeg can not be reconstructed unless at least a small fraction of recombination energy is taken into account @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ikpeg the two pcebs discussed here ,",
    "sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 , contain relatively low - mass c / o - core wds ( table[t - param ] ) , therefore their progenitors filled their roche lobes early on the agb , i.e. when the envelope was not very extended .",
    "recombination energy , however , is expected to be most important when the wd progenitor radius is large and the envelope is loosely bound @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of ikpeg is therefore not only its long orbital period but also the high mass of its wd , which implies that the system entered the ce phase when the radius of the primary was very large on the agb , a peculiarity our two pcebs do not share .    to predict which kind of pcebs",
    "would provide the desired direct evidence for contributions of recombination energy we once more use the reconstruction algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "as usual we assume that the wd mass is equal to the core mass of the giant progenitor at the onset of mass transfer and that the secondary star mass remains constant during ce evolution .",
    "for a given core mass we use the sse code from @xcite to calculate all possible progenitor masses and their radii . as the radius of the progenitor",
    "must have been equal to the roche radius at the onset of ce evolution we obtain the initial separation for given white dwarf and main sequence companion masses , leaving the final orbital period and the ce efficiency as the remaining free parameters connected via the energy equation . for each progenitor",
    "mass the solution with @xmath48 corresponds to the longest possible final orbital period not violating energy conservation . among these possible solutions we finally can select the maximum orbital period for a given combination of white dwarf and secondary star masses .",
    "in figure[fig : m1p ] we show the resulting pceb maximum orbital period as a function of wd mass assuming a fixed secondary star mass of @xmath49 . the positions of sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221",
    "+ 0029 are indicated by black solid dots .",
    "the dashed lines have been obtained by assuming that all the available recombination energy goes into envelope ejection while the solid lines represent the maximum orbital period if the envelope is expelled by the use of orbital energy only . the upper and lower ( solid and dashed ) gray lines correspond to @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "the orbital period limits increase with the secondary star mass because pcebs with more massive secondaries have more orbital energy available .",
    "any pceb located above the solid line in figure[fig : m1p ] ( for a given secondary star mass ) would provide direct evidence for contributions of additional energy sources . apparently , recombination energy as the most likely extra - energy can only be important on the tip of the fgb and on the agb ( see dashed lines in figure[fig : m1p ] ) . for high mass wds ( @xmath3 ) the range of orbital periods that would provide evidence for recombination energy",
    "is significantly shifted towards shorter ( easily measurable ) orbital periods of a few days .",
    "however , so far not a single known pceb apart from ikpeg has a relatively long orbital period _ and _ contains a high - mass wd .",
    "the seven sdss pcebs with accurately determined orbital periods and stellar parameters containing massive wds ( @xmath52 ) have orbital periods shorter than one day ( see table3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this might further indicate that the fraction of recombination energy going into envelope ejection is small .",
    "however , further observational constraints are required to confirm this supposition .",
    "we have therefore just started an observing campaign to measure orbital periods of additional sdss pcebs with @xmath3 to further constrain the importance of recombination energy during ce evolution .",
    "the secondary star masses of the pcebs in our sdss follow - up project are mostly in the range of @xmath53 which corresponds to orbital period limits given by the full use of orbital energy of @xmath54 days ( see figure[fig : m1p ] ) .",
    "direct evidence for additional energy , most likely from recombination , would be provided if at least one system will be found to have a period exceeding this limit .",
    "if in contrast no such system will be detected , the contribution of recombination energy during ce evolution is likely of minor importance .",
    "we have measured the orbital periods of sdssj1211 - 0249 and sdssj2221 + 0029 to be 7.818@xmath210.002 and 9.588@xmath210.002 days respectively .",
    "this makes them the longest orbital period pcebs containing a wd primary and main sequence companion after the well known record holder ikpeg .",
    "we reconstructed the ce evolution of both systems taking into account and ignoring additional sources of energy .",
    "although no direct evidence for contributions of recombination energy during ce evolution is provided , it appears plausible that at least a small fraction of this energy helped expelling the envelope .",
    "measuring the orbital periods of more pcebs containing high - mass ( @xmath3 ) wds will provide further constraints on the importance of recombination energy during ce evolution .",
