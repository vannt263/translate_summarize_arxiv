    "<S> [ db ] a ) , we show the relative contribution of the terms in the ope side of the sum rule , for @xmath37 . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that the contribution of the dimension-8 condensate is smaller than @xmath38 of the total contribution for values of @xmath39 , which indicates a good ope convergence . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db ] b ) , we also see that the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution only for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we fix the borel window as : @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the mass are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db ] c ) , as a function of @xmath33 , for different values of @xmath42 . as we can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db ] c ) , the borel window ( indicated through the parenthesis ) gets smaller as the value of @xmath34 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> so , we can only work with values for @xmath34 bigger than @xmath43 , otherwise we do not obtain a valid borel window for this sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the optimal choice for the continuum threshold is @xmath27 , because it provides the best @xmath44stability inside of the borel window , including the existence of a minimum point for the value of the mass .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , varying the value of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath45 , and the others parameters as indicated in table [ param ] , we get : m^8_db & = & ( 6.77 0.11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ mdb8 ] the quoted uncertainty is the ope uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the most important source of uncertainty is the values of the heavy quark masses . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there is another kind of uncertainty , called systematic uncertainty , related to the intrinsic limited accuracy of the method . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic uncertainty of the physical quantity extracted from the qcdsr represents , perhaps , the most subtle point in the application of the method . without an estimate of the systematic uncertainty , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the physical quantity one reads off from the borel window might differ significantly from its true value . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown that the use of the borel dependent continuum threshold allows to estimate the systematic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the case of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons studied in @xcite , the systematic uncertainty turns out to be of the same order of the ope uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> since here we do not have how to estimate the borel dependent continuum threshold , in an attempt to obtain some information about the systematic uncertainty , we will repeat the analysis considering only terms up to dimension 6 in the ope . </S>",
    "<S> these new results are shown in the fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ db_6 ] . as one can see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db_6 ] a ) , when we remove the dimension 8 condensates contribution we lose the ope convergence , since the most important contributions to the ope come from @xmath28 and @xmath48 contributions . </S>",
    "<S> thus to be able to extract some results from this analysis we determine the maximum value of @xmath33 parameter imposing that the contribution of the dimension 6 condensate is smaller than 25% of the total contribution , otherwise we do not have a valid borel window for this sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum value of @xmath33 is not changed since the pole dominance behavior remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we obtain the results shown in the fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ db_6 ] c ) , from where we get : m^6_db & = & ( 6.63 0.09 ) . [ mdb6 ]    note that the value in eq.([mdb6 ] ) differs at maximum only @xmath495.0% to that in eq.([mdb8 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the inclusion of dimension 8 condensate provides a better ope convergence , @xmath33-stability and an improved borel window . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even being aware that this is only part of the dimension-8 contribution , here we consider it as a form to estimate the systematic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that a complete evaluation of the dimension-8 contributions require more involved analysis including a non - trivial choice of the factorization assumption basis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the final value for the @xmath50 molecular state is given by : m_db & = & ( 6.75 0.14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ mdb ]    the mass in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mdb ] ) is @xmath51 below the @xmath50 threshold indicating that such molecular state would be tightly bound . </S>",
    "<S> this result , for the binding energy , is very different than the obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the @xmath36 molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found that the @xmath36 molecular state is loosely bound with a binding energy smaller than @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is very important to notice that since the molecular currents given in table [ mol ] are local , they do not represent extended objects , with two mesons separated in space , but rather a very compact object with two singlet quark - antiquark pairs . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the result obtained here may suggest that , although a loosely bound @xmath36 molecular state can exist , it may not be the ground state for a four - quark exotic state with the same quantum numbers and quark content .    </S>",
    "<S> having the hadron mass , we can also evaluate the coupling parameter , @xmath53 , defined in the eq.([o+ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we get : _ db & = & ( 0.029 0.008 ) ^5  . </S>",
    "<S> [ ldb ] the parameter @xmath53 gives a measure of the strength of the coupling between the current and the state . </S>",
    "<S> the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ldb ] ) has the same order of magnitude as the coupling obtained for the @xmath7 @xcite , for example . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that such state could be very well represented by the respective current in table [ mol ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we can extend the same analysis to study the others molecular states presented in table [ mol ] . </S>",
    "<S> for all of them we get a similar ope convergence in a region where the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the results shown in the fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ dxbx ] .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dxbx ] a ) , we show the ground state mass , for the @xmath54 , @xmath55 molecular current , as a function of @xmath33 . for @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> , we can fix the borel window as : @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> > from this figure we again see that there is a very good @xmath33-stability in the determined borel window .    varying the value of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath58 , the others parameters as indicated in table [ param ] and also estimating the uncertainty by neglecting the dimension-8 contribution we get : m_d^*b^ * & = & ( 7.270.12 )  , + _ d^*b^ * & = & ( 0.1150.021 )  ^5  . </S>",
