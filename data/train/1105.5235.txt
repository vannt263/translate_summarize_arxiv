    "the theory of optimal rocket trajectories in the context of newtonian mechanics is beautifully developed in the classical reference @xcite . in this paper , we generalize this theory to the general relativity setting .",
    "we find that it is possible to formulate the theory in a fully covariant fashion , with all relevant auxiliary variables having geometric meaning .    while it can be argued that this generalization is of little practical interest ( we are quite far from being able to build a rocket capable of moving at relativistic speeds ! ) , it turns out that the geometric perspective of general relativity brings fresh insights into this classical application of control theory  for instance , the relation of the primer equation with the jacobi equation ( theorem  [ conditions ] ) , or the fact that ignorable coordinates restrict variations to geodesics with the same killing conserved quantities ( theorem  [ ignorable ] ) .",
    "moreover , this theory can be used to address theoretical issues in general relativity @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ section1 ]",
    ", we derive the well known rocket equation in general relativity , relating the initial and final rest masses of a rocket following a given spacetime trajectory .",
    "this is done mainly for the reader s convenience , as well as to fix the notation . in section  [ section2 ] , we recall the details of mayer problem in optimal control theory , which we use in section  [ section3 ] to derive the optimality conditions under the assumption that the magnitude of the proper acceleration is bounded .",
    "these conditions are essentially a covariant differential equation for an auxiliary vector field defined along the trajectory , called the primer , whose direction gives the direction of the acceleration , and whose magnitude determines whether the rocket is undergoing maximum acceleration , intermediate acceleration , or free - falling . in section  [ section4 ] , we examine the behavior of the optimal trajectories as we let the bound on the acceleration tend to infinity .",
    "we find that the maximum acceleration arcs collapse to instantaneous accelerations , whose locations and directions are again determined by the primer . in section  [ section5 ] , we study the general @xmath0-dimensional problem , which we then particularize in section  [ section6 ] to the problem of finding the minimum fuel consumption transfer between two galaxies in a flrw model . besides the general theory , we use a lorentzian version of the gauss - bonnet theorem to find these optimal trajectories , under the assumption that the expansion of the universe is either accelerating or non - accelerating . in section  [ section7",
    "] , we study the role of ignorable coordinates , which we use in section  [ section8 ] to solve the problem of finding the minimum fuel consumption transfer between two stable circular orbits in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we use the conventions of @xcite , including geometrized units ( in which the speed of light and newton s gravitational constant are set equal to @xmath0 ) and the einstein summation convention ; when using the latter , greek letters will always represent spacetime indices .",
    "to study a relativistic rocket moving in @xmath1 space dimensions , we must consider a @xmath2-dimensional spacetime @xmath3 , that is , a smooth . ]",
    "@xmath2-dimensional manifold @xmath4 endowed with a lorentzian metric @xmath5 .",
    "we assume @xmath3 to be time - orientable , with a definite choice of time orientation .",
    "if the rocket s size is sufficiently small ( as compared to the local radius of curvature ) , so that it can be modelled as a point particle , then its spacetime trajectory is given by a smooth future - directed timelike curve @xmath6 \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}\\to m$ ] , which we assume to be parameterized by the proper time @xmath7 ( that is , the spacetime velocity @xmath8 is a unit vector , @xmath9 ) .",
    "since the rocket must eject particles to accelerate , its rest mass will not be constant , but will be given instead by a smooth function @xmath10 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}^+$ ] . for the same reason , the rocket s energy - momentum vector @xmath11 will not be conserved , and so we will have @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the levi - civita connection of @xmath5 and @xmath14 is a vector field along @xmath15 representing the instantaneous rate ( with respect to proper time ) at which energy - momentum is being carried away by the exhaust .",
    "the only _ a priori _ restriction to @xmath14 is that it must be timelike or null and future - directed , corresponding to the physical requirement that the speed of the exhaust particles must not exceed the speed of light . rewriting as @xmath16 and noting that the covariant acceleration @xmath17 is orthogonal to the unit tangent vector @xmath8 ( hence spacelike )",
    ", we see that the _ a priori _ restriction on @xmath14 requires that @xmath18 ( so that @xmath14 is future - directed ) , that is , the rocket s rest mass is a nonincreasing function .",
    "moreover , we must have @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 ( because @xmath14 can not be spacelike ) , and so @xmath21 for some spacelike vector field @xmath22 orthogonal to @xmath8 satisfying @xmath23 ( so that @xmath14 is timelike or null ) . note that the norm @xmath24 can be interpreted as the instantaneous speed of the exhaust particles as measured by the rocket . comparing and , we have @xmath25 ( the minus sign coming from the fact that @xmath26 is nonincreasing ) .    in this paper , we will be interested in the case where speed of the exhaust particles is constant , that is , @xmath27 for some constant @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 ( the extreme case @xmath30 corresponding to the exhaust particles moving at the speed of light , that is , a photon rocket ) .",
    "integrating we then obtain the following result ( see also @xcite ) .    for the relativistic rocket model specified above",
    ", the final rest mass @xmath31 is related to its initial rest mass @xmath32 by the formula @xmath33    to minimize the fuel consumption , one must then minimize the action determined by the second order lagrangian @xmath34 , which is not differentiable along its zero level set .",
    "for this reason , the standard euler - lagrange equations can not be used directly , and one must turn to optimal control theory .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the mayer problem in optimal control . for more details see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the setup of the mayer problem is as follows : on a compact interval @xmath35 $ ] we consider @xmath36 continuous , piecewise smooth$ ] to be given by restrictions of smooth functions defined on @xmath37 to the subintervals of a partition of @xmath35 $ ] ; in particular , piecewise smooth functions and all their derivatives have one - sided limits at all points . ]",
    "functions @xmath38\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] , called the * state variables * , and @xmath26 piecewise smooth functions @xmath39\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] , called the * control variables*. each choice of the control variables completely determines the state variables via the cauchy problem @xmath40 ( where the functions @xmath41 are smooth ) .",
    "we require the control variables to satisfy the @xmath42 independent has rank @xmath43 . ]",
    "constraint equations @xmath44 for each @xmath45 $ ] , and the state variables to satisfy the endpoint conditions @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "the mayer problem consists in choosing the control variables so that @xmath48 is minimized , where @xmath49 is a given smooth function and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "the problem can be slightly generalized by letting @xmath52 be variable , in which case @xmath14 may also depend on @xmath52 .",
    "the solution of the mayer problem is obtained from the * pontryagin maximum principle * as follows : we introduce @xmath36 additional variables @xmath53 , called the * momenta * , and define the * hamiltonian * @xmath54 where the maximum is taken over all @xmath55 satisfying the constraint equations at time @xmath7 . then @xmath14 is minimized for state variables solving * hamilton s equations * @xmath56 with the initial conditions @xmath57 chosen such that @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath51 . if @xmath52 is allowed to vary , then its value can be determined from the additional endpoint condition @xmath61    computing the hamiltonian is a constrained maximization problem , and leads to the conditions @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the * lagrange expression * @xmath64 these conditions , together with the constraint equations , yield @xmath55 and @xmath65 as functions of the variables @xmath66 , thereby introducing @xmath43 additional piecewise smooth functions @xmath67 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] , which are called the * lagrange multipliers*. gives the rate of change of the hamiltonian as the value of the constraint @xmath68 is varied . ]    it is possible to use the lagrange expression to obtain a shortcut for writing hamilton s equations .",
    "indeed , if the constraints are satisfied , then @xmath69 and hence @xmath70 therefore , hamilton s equations can be written as @xmath71 without the need to explicitly compute the hamiltonian @xmath72 .",
    "we now set up the problem of finding minimum fuel consumption trajectories as a mayer problem . for that",
    ", we choose local coordinates @xmath73 on our spacetime manifold @xmath4 . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the metric is given by some matrix @xmath74 , and the levi - civita connection is determined by the christoffel symbols @xmath75 , which can be computed from the metric by the formula @xmath76 if the rocket s trajectory @xmath6 \\to m$ ] is given in these local coordinates by @xmath77 , then its spacetime velocity @xmath78 has components @xmath79 , and its covariant acceleration @xmath80 has components @xmath81 as we have seen , the covariant acceleration @xmath82 is orthogonal to the spacetime velocity @xmath83 , hence spacelike .",
    "consequently , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a unit spacelike vector ( that is , @xmath87 ) .",
    "the reasonable assumption is that the rocket is able to control the direction and intensity of its exhaust , hence @xmath86 and @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath88 and the components @xmath89 of @xmath86 as our control variables .",
    "moreover , it is physically natural ( and , as it turns out , mathematically desirable ) to assume an upper bound @xmath90 on the acceleration that the rocket is able to achieve .",
    "this leads to the constraint @xmath91 , which we will implement by introducing an extra control variable @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath93 control variables @xmath94 .    as state variables , describing the rocket s trajectory",
    ", we must then choose the rocket s spacetime coordinates @xmath95 and the components @xmath96 of its spacetime velocity .",
    "moreover , we introduce an additional variable @xmath97 ( called the * cost * ) , which we will use to measure the fuel consumption . therefore , we have @xmath98 state variables @xmath99 . from , the evolution of the first @xmath100 state variables will be given by the equations @xmath101 and we choose @xmath102 by , the final mass of the rocket is will then be @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , minimizing the fuel consumption is equivalent to minimizing the final cost , @xmath105 .",
    "we will , however , keep @xmath14 general , as it makes little difference in the minimum conditions .",
    "the fact that we want to use the proper time @xmath7 as the time parameter must be specified through the constraint equation @xmath106 this guarantees that @xmath107 is orthogonal to @xmath83 , implying that the length of @xmath83 is constant ; we will assume the initial conditions to be chosen so that @xmath108 ( note that this is * not * an extra constraint ) .",
    "a further constraint is necessary to specify that @xmath88 is the norm of the acceleration , or , equivalently , that @xmath86 is a unit vector , namely @xmath109 finally , it is necessary to require that @xmath110 .",
    "these inequalities can be accommodated by the constraint equation @xmath111 we can now write the minimum conditions .",
    "the lagrange expression is @xmath112.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we have the hamilton equations @xmath113 and the pontryagin conditions @xmath114 the last pontryagin condition implies that either @xmath115 ( in which case we must have @xmath116 or @xmath117 ) or @xmath118 ( in which case we may have @xmath119 ) .",
    "therefore , the rocket s trajectory is naturally divided into zero acceleration ( za ) arcs ( @xmath116 ) , maximal acceleration ( ma ) arcs ( @xmath117 ) and intermediate acceleration ( ia ) arcs ( @xmath119).^{\\frac12},\\ ] ] subject to the constraint @xmath120 . ]",
    "assume first that @xmath121 .",
    "then the first pontryagin condition , together with , and , implies @xmath122 where @xmath123 since @xmath86 has to be chosen so that lagrange expression is maximized , we must have @xmath124 ( because otherwise it would be possible to increase @xmath125 , and so @xmath63 , by reversing @xmath86 ) .",
    "if the constraints are satisfied , the terms proportional to @xmath88 in the lagrange expression are @xmath126 since again the choice of @xmath88 has to maximize the lagrange expression , we must have @xmath127 on a ma arc ( because otherwise it would be possible to increase @xmath63 by decreasing @xmath88 ) and @xmath128 on a ia arc ( because otherwise it would be possible to increase @xmath63 by either increasing or decreasing @xmath88 ) .    on a za arc , the control variables @xmath89 can be chosen arbitrarily ( as long as they satisfy the constraint equations ) .",
    "therefore , we keep the choice @xmath129 whenever @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are the components of the projection of the vector @xmath43 on the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath83 and @xmath132 with this choice , and still hold , and so maximizing the lagrange expression with respect to to @xmath88 requires @xmath133 on a za arc ( because otherwise it would be possible to increase @xmath63 by increasing @xmath88 ) .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath134 and @xmath135 can be determined by contracting the first pontryagin condition with @xmath83 and @xmath86 , which yields @xmath136 and @xmath137    the first hamilton equation can be rewritten as @xmath138 where @xmath139 the second hamilton equation then yields @xmath140 where we have used , and to write @xmath141 now , using , we have @xmath142 and , similarly , @xmath143 therefore , the terms proportional to @xmath134 and @xmath135 drop out of , and we are left with @xmath144    it is convenient to write the hamilton equations using the modified momentum variables @xmath145 .",
    "we have @xmath146 where we used and , and defined @xmath147 this function can be determined from the hamiltonian first integral @xmath148 which , in view of and , can be written as @xmath149 in fact , if we contract with @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath150    if @xmath52 is not specified , then @xmath151 the remaining endpoint conditions depend on the exact nature of the problem .",
    "the standard problem of minimizing the fuel consumption , as we have seen , corresponds to @xmath152 . in this case , the values of all state variables except @xmath97 are fixed at @xmath153 , and we have the additional endpoint condition @xmath154 moreover , if @xmath52 is not fixed , then @xmath155 .",
    "following @xcite , we shall call the spacelike vector field @xmath156 and the function @xmath157 the * primer * and the * switching function * of the trajectory .",
    "like all variables in our problem , they are piecewise smooth .",
    "moreover , it is known from the general theory of the mayer problem that both the momentum variables and the hamiltonian must be continuous along the optimal trajectory .",
    "therefore , both the primer and the switching function are continuous .",
    "the continuity of @xmath72 then implies that @xmath157 must vanish at the discontinuities of @xmath88 .",
    "to summarize , we have proved the following result .",
    "[ conditions ] the optimal motion of the rocket is obtained from the motion equation @xmath158 by choosing @xmath159 where @xmath160 and the primer @xmath161 satisfies @xmath162 and @xmath163 here , the switching function @xmath164 , with @xmath165 constant , satisfies @xmath127 on ma arcs , @xmath166 on ia arcs and @xmath133 on za arcs , and the hamiltonian integration constant @xmath167 is given by @xmath168 if @xmath52 is not fixed .",
    "moreover , @xmath169 for the fuel minimizing problem .",
    "the problem is simplified if we take the limit @xmath170 , corresponding to situations where the duration of the maximum acceleration periods is negligible .",
    "we assume that this limit exists and that all functions converge to piecewise smooth functions . in this limit , the ma arcs collapse to points where we have instantaneous ( dirac delta ) accelerations . at such points",
    "we have :    a.   @xmath95 is continuous , because @xmath171 is at most discontinuous ; b.   @xmath172 is continuous , because @xmath173 is at most discontinuous ; c.   [ last ] @xmath96 and @xmath161 have a discontinuity given by a ( positive ) boost in their plane , because @xmath174 , @xmath175 is a positive multiple of @xmath161 , and , in the limit , @xmath176 is a positive multiple of @xmath96 ( in particular , @xmath125 , and hence @xmath157 , are continuous ) ; d.   @xmath166 , because this always happens at the endpoints of a ma arc .    both @xmath157 and",
    "@xmath125 attain their maximum at the instantaneous acceleration , where we must therefore have @xmath177 .",
    "statement ( [ last ] ) can then be written as @xmath178 for some @xmath179 , where the indices @xmath180 and @xmath181 denote the limits at the instantaneous acceleration from the left and from the right . since @xmath182 on both za and ia arcs , the hamiltonian integration constant yields",
    "@xmath183 which , together with , imply @xmath184 since by @xmath185 we have @xmath186 that is , @xmath187 reverses its sign at the instantaneous acceleration .",
    "if @xmath155 ( as is the case if @xmath52 is not specified and @xmath14 does not depend on @xmath52 ) , then implies that @xmath125 is continuously differentiable with @xmath188 at an instantaneous acceleration .",
    "in fact , in this case , @xmath125 is actually a @xmath189 function : using @xmath182 on za and ia arcs , whence @xmath190 , and @xmath191 , we have @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by @xmath83 and @xmath156 , and so @xmath194 is continuous at an instantaneous acceleration .",
    "we collect all these results in the following statement .    [ instantaneous ] at an instantaneous acceleration we have :    a.   @xmath83 and @xmath156 have a discontinuity given by a ( positive ) boost in their plane ; b.   @xmath125 reaches its maximum and is continuous ; c.   @xmath187 reverses sign ; d.   if @xmath155 , then @xmath125 is a @xmath189 function .",
    "we now consider the simplest case @xmath195 , corresponding to problems where the rocket moves along a line .",
    "the spacetime @xmath3 is thus @xmath196-dimensional .    because @xmath125 is constant on ia arcs , we have from @xmath197 since @xmath198 is an orthonormal frame and @xmath199 , we must have @xmath200 and hence , from the hamilton equations , @xmath201 ( where @xmath202 is the sectional curvature ) .",
    "it immediately follows that , if @xmath155 ( as will be the case if @xmath52 is not specified and @xmath14 does not depend on @xmath52 ) , then ia arcs can only exist in a flat spacetime .",
    "even if @xmath203 , ia arcs can only exist if the curvature has the same sign as @xmath72 .    on za arcs ,",
    "on the other hand , we have @xmath204 , i.e.  @xmath83 is parallel transported .",
    "since @xmath198 is an orthonormal frame , it follows that @xmath86 is also parallel transported . using @xmath205",
    ", the hamilton equations reduce to @xmath206    in summary , we have the following result .    [ 1dim ]",
    "if @xmath3 is @xmath196-dimensional , then :    a.   @xmath207 on ia arcs ; b.   @xmath208 on za arcs .",
    "recall that the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models are given in spherical coordinates @xmath209 by metrics of the form @xmath210 \\qquad ( k=-1,0,1),\\ ] ] where @xmath211 ( flat universe ) , @xmath212 ( spherical universe ) and @xmath213 ( hyperbolic universe ) .",
    "these metrics describe spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes , and are believed to provide a good model for the large scale structure of our own universe .",
    "the matter content of these universes is usually taken to be a pressureless perfect fluid of uniform density @xmath125 , whose elements are fixed at constant spatial coordinates , and are interpreted as ( the averaged version of ) galaxies ( or clusters of galaxies ) .",
    "the einstein field equations then determine the time evolution of the scale factor @xmath214 and the matter density @xmath215 , according to the friedmann equations @xmath216 ( where @xmath217 is a constant determining the matter density and @xmath218 is the cosmological constant ) .",
    "the flat minkowski spacetime is a particular case , corresponding to @xmath219 .",
    "we consider the problem of transfer between two galaxies in a flrw universe .",
    "assuming the first galaxy to be placed at @xmath220 , it is easily seen that the motion must occur along the line of constant @xmath221 joining the two galaxies , and so this is naturally a @xmath0-dimensional problem .",

    "recall that the schwarzschild solution is the unique spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum einstein field equations , given in spherical coordinates @xmath209 by the metric @xmath294 it represents the gravitational field created by a spherically symmetric body of mass @xmath4 ( which we assume to be positive ) , and so models the vicinity of an isolated planet or star ( or even a more exotic object , like a neutron star or a black hole ) .",
    "we consider the problem of finding the most fuel - efficient transfer between two stable circular orbits in the schwarzschild metric . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to motions the @xmath295-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold @xmath296 , corresponding to the equatorial plane , whose metric is @xmath297 we will not fix @xmath52 ( hence @xmath155 ) , @xmath298 or @xmath299 ( and so @xmath300 and @xmath301 are ignorable coordinates ) . moreover , the choice @xmath105 implies @xmath302 .",
    "the geodesic equations in the coordinate system above can be written as @xmath303 where @xmath304 and @xmath305 are integration constants .",
    "equation for @xmath306 can be obtained by linearizing the first geodesic equation while keeping @xmath304 fixed : @xmath307 similarly , equation for @xmath308 can be obtained by linearizing the third geodesic equation while keeping @xmath305 fixed : @xmath309 since @xmath310 and @xmath311 are conserved , the proper time derivative of the constraint @xmath312 is @xmath313 using and yields @xmath314 and from the radial component of the geodesic equations we have @xmath315 for non - circular orbits , this equation is readily solved : @xmath316 where @xmath317 is an integration constant . substituting on and using the first geodesic equation yields @xmath318 where @xmath319 is another integration constant .",
    "similarly , substituting on and using the third geodesic equation yields @xmath320 where @xmath321 is yet another integration constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath161 is a linear combination of three obvious jacobi fields : @xmath322 the condition @xmath323 imposes a restriction on the integration constants , namely @xmath324 we then see that @xmath325 and , consequently , @xmath326 thus @xmath187 can only be zero if @xmath327 or @xmath328 .",
    "this second possibility , however , corresponds to a minimum of @xmath329 , and hence can not happen at an instantaneous acceleration or transition to an ia arc .",
    "we conclude that the optimal trajectory can only enter or leave a non - circular orbit at a turning point , that is , a point where @xmath327 . at these points",
    ", we will have @xmath330 , meaning that the acceleration will be tangential to the orbit .    for circular orbits , does not yield any information , and we have to write the radial component of the jacobi equation . a shortcut to do so",
    "is the following : using the normalization condition @xmath331 we can recast the radial component of the geodesic equations in the form @xmath332 linearizing the equation above while keeping @xmath305 constant yields @xmath333 where we used to write @xmath334 on a circular orbit . from @xmath335 and @xmath336",
    "we have @xmath337 therefore @xmath338 and hence @xmath339 where we used .",
    "so , for @xmath340 , we will have @xmath188 if @xmath341 , or @xmath342 in this second case we will have @xmath343 which is strictly positive unless @xmath341 .",
    "we conclude that the optimal trajectory can only enter or leave a circular orbit at points where @xmath341 , meaning that the acceleration will be tangential to the orbit .",
    "we now show that the optimal trajectory can not contain ia arcs .",
    "let us start by showing that , if a ia arc exists , then none of its endpoints can be a non - circular za arc .",
    "since @xmath125 is a @xmath189 function and @xmath344 on a ia arc , then we must have @xmath345 at za arc s endpoint . from and",
    "the fact that @xmath346 at the endpoint , we obtain @xmath347 now , @xmath348 never vanishes at a turning point , and the expression in brackets vanishes only at the minimum of @xmath125 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath194 can not vanish at the endpoint , and hence a ia arc can not have an endpoint on a noncircular za arc .    for circular orbits ,",
    "the story is more complicated . using the formula @xmath349 obtained while deducing , we have @xmath350 since on a transition point to a @xmath351 arc we must have @xmath340 and @xmath352",
    ", the formula above requires that either @xmath353 or holds . differentiating again yields @xmath354 which shows that @xmath355 at the transition point .",
    "finally , differentiating once more and assuming that holds , we have @xmath356 showing that , if @xmath357 , then @xmath125 would have a local minimum at the transition point .",
    "but that is impossible , since @xmath358 on the circular orbit ; therefore , we must have @xmath359 at the transition point .",
    "since @xmath360 satisfies the second - order linear ode , we conclude that @xmath360 must vanish identically on the circular orbit , and hence @xmath161 must be a linear combination of the killing vector fields @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "these fields are orthogonal and have constant norm over the circular orbit , and hence we will have @xmath363 on the circular orbit .",
    "we then see that a ia arc can only join circular orbits where @xmath363 . the same reasoning as for ia arcs shows that these circular orbits can not have an endpoint on a non - circular orbit .",
    "we conclude that , if the optimal trajectory contains a ia arc , then it must consist solely of ia arcs , circular orbits and instantaneous accelerations , and , moreover , we must have @xmath363 throughout the trajectory .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the optimal trajectory contains a stable circular orbit , then it is always possible to add a non - circular za arc . indeed ,",
    "if the trajectory departs from the stable circular orbit via a ia arc , then we can interrupt this arc after a sufficiently small proper time interval to achieve a non - circular orbit .",
    "this orbit is periodic in @xmath364 and will return to the same values of @xmath365 after a certain proper time period , at which point the initial ia arc can be resumed ( from different values of @xmath300 and @xmath301 , but the final values of these variables are not fixed ) . if there is an instantaneous acceleration at the stable circular orbit s endpoint , then it can be broken into an initial small enough instantaneous acceleration , followed by a non - circular za arc , followed by the remaining instantaneous acceleration ( again from a point with different values of @xmath300 and @xmath301 ) .",
    "this has exactly the same cost as the original instantaneous acceleration , and so the resulting trajectory will also be optimal .",
    "we conclude that , if the optimal trajectory contains a stable circular orbit , then no ia arc can exist .",
    "therefore we have proved the following result .",
    "[ schwarzschild ] the optimal trajectory for the transfer of a rocket between two stable circular orbits in the schwarzschild metric with minimum fuel consumption is composed of za arcs and instantaneous accelerations tangent to the za arcs , which must be at turning points for noncircular za arcs .",
    "the simplest of such trajectories is the relativistic analogue of the celebrated * hohmann transfer manoeuvre * @xcite , consisting of a single noncircular za arc connecting the two stable circular orbits ( cf .",
    "figure  [ hohmann ] ) .",
    "we have derived the covariant optimality conditions for rocket trajectories in general relativity , with and without a bound on the magnitude of the proper acceleration ( theorems  [ conditions ] and [ instantaneous ] ) .",
    "these conditions are essentially a covariant differential equation for an auxiliary vector field defined along the trajectory ( the primer ) , closely related to the jacobi equation .",
    "we studied these conditions for general @xmath0-dimensional problems ( theorem  [ 1dim ] ) , and then particularized to the problem of the optimal transfer between two galaxies in a flrw model .",
    "we found that for generic classes of models ( including the flat minkowski spacetime ) the optimal trajectory consists of an initial instantaneous acceleration , followed by free - fall motion and a final instantaneous acceleration ( theorem  [ flrwthm ] ) .",
    "we showed that ignorable coordinates lead to great simplifications in the optimality conditions ( theorem  [ ignorable ] ) , and used this to study the problem of optimal transfer between two stable circular orbits in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "here we found that the optimal trajectories consist of free fall motions connected by tangential instantaneous accelerations ( theorem  [ schwarzschild ] ) , including the relativistic analogue of the celebrated hohmann transfer manoeuvre ."
