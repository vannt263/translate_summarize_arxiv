    "it is now well established that hard x - ray emission ( e @xmath10 kev ) from x - ray binaries is not exclusively associated with black hole systems ( bhs ) .",
    "the major breakthrough came with the sigma and batse observations , which provided the first unambiguous detections of type i x - ray bursters ( hence neutron star systems , nss ) at @xmath11 kev ( barret & vedrenne 1994 , barret & tavani 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "however , due to the moderate sensitivity and low spectral resolution of these instruments and the lack of simultaneous x - ray observations , it was impossible to investigate the conditions under which nss emit hard x - rays .",
    "similarly , very little could be inferred about the accretion geometry and the relative contribution of the potential emitting regions to the total emission ( ns surface , boundary layer , accretion disk , corona ) .",
    "in addition , the hard x - ray data alone were not good enough to discriminate between the thermal and non - thermal models that have been put forward to account for this emission .",
    "finally , if the emission of hard x - rays is indeed common to bhs and nss , there may remain some differences either in the shape of the hard tails ( position of the energy cutoff ; e.g. tavani & barret 1997 , churazov et al .",
    "1995 ) , or in the luminosities that can be radiated simultaneously in soft and hard x - rays ( barret et al .",
    "1996 , van paradijs & van der klis 1994 , barret & vedrenne 1994 , zhang et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "all these potential differences have yet to be quantified precisely .",
    "they can now be addressed through observations performed by the  and the  ( rxte ) satellites ; the latter combining the proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) ( bradt et al . 1993 ) .",
    "these two instruments offer for the first time the possibility of observing nss with good sensitivity and excellent timing capabilities simultaneously from 2 to @xmath12 kev .    in this paper , we report on the rxte observations of four type i x - ray bursters ; namely , ,  and .",
    "all these sources have in common that they have already been detected up to @xmath11 kev at least once ( barret & tavani 1997 ) . the analysis has been made in a coherent way for all sources to allow a reliable and consistent comparison of their respective properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we review the relevant spectral observations of the four sources , and present their long term rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) light curves ( sect 2 ) .",
    "we then describe our data reduction scheme , before presenting the results of our rxte pointed observations ( sect 3 ) . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the main features of our timing and spectral results and their implications for our understanding of ns accretion .",
    "finally , we discuss the most recent observational criteria that have been proposed to distinguish non - quiescent bhs and nss on the basis on their broad band spectral properties .",

    "1997 ) , and recently revised to 6.6 kpc ( barbuy et al .",
    "it is a weakly variable x - ray source , and a persistent , though variable , hard x - ray source ( goldwurm et al . 1993 , 1994 ) .",

    "broad band spectral observations have already been performed by  ( guainazzi et al .",
    "they showed that the 1 to 200 kev spectrum could be well fitted by the sum of a soft and a hard comptonized component .",
    "the former could be equally fitted by a single temperature blackbody ( bb ) of = 0.6 kev , = 12 km , or a multi - color disk blackbody ( mcd , mitsuda et al .",

    "the hard comptonized component was fitted with a  model ( titarchuk 1994 ) with an electron temperature of @xmath13 kev , an optical depth @xmath14 for a spherical scattering cloud , and a temperature of 0.6 kev ( ) for the seed photons .",
    "the ratio of the bolometric ( 0.1 - 100 kev ) luminosity of the soft component to the total luminosity was 11% and 36% for the bb and mcd models respectively .",
    "however , as pointed out by guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , whereas the radius derived from the bb fit is close to the ns radius , the very small value inferred for times less than the measured , see gierlinski et al . 1999 ) .",
    "correction for spectral hardening must be made to  and  to account for the fact that the inner disk opacity is dominated by electron scattering .",
    "we use a spectral hardening factor f=1.7 , a value consistent with the source luminosity ( shimura & takahara 1995 ) , and determine the effective temperature as = /f , and the effective inner disk radius as @xmath15 = 2.9 . for , this means that = 0.82 kev , = 11.4 km for an assumed inclination angle of 60  ( the source is not a dipper , therefore its inclination must be less than 75 ) .",

    "appears unphysical ( for any plausible values of the source inclination ) ; hence the hypothesis that the soft component comes from the boundary layer around the ns might be preferred .",
    "an asca observation confirmed the hardness of the source in x - rays , and allowed an accurate determination of  towards the source ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "the source was later detected by ttm ( int zand 1992 ) , rosat - pspc ( barret et al .",

    "the 70 bursts observed over more than 2.5 years of source monitoring exhibit a quasi - periodicity of 5.76 hours in their occurrence times ( ubertini et al .",

    "this never improved the fit either .",
    "the non detection of such a component might be simply related to the curvey shape of the spectrum ( in particular the continuum is not a cpl as assumed in ) ; reflection is easier to observe when the continuum is pl - like ( note that if there is indeed a reflection component ; this will affect the fitted parameters for the continuum and hence the strength of the iron line ) .",
    "the same model is also the best fit of the october 29th and 30th spectra . in table 4 , we list the best fit parameters for the + + line and + + line models . the data and folded model , the residuals and unfolded spectrum  for october 28th are shown in fig .",

    "such x - ray luminosity is slightly larger than the time averaged asm value . throughout the observation ,",
    "contributed just at the level of@xmath205% to the 1 - 200 kev luminosity of the source .",
    "we have here reported rxte pca+hexte timing and spectral observations of four type i x - ray bursters ( hence nss ) . in the remainder , first we discuss their timing properties , then their broad band spectral properties , and finally address issues concerning possible differences between bhs and nss .      ,  and gs1826 - 238 were in a so - called low state ( ls ) whereas  was in a high state ( hs ) .",
    "the ls sources all have very similar pds , characterized by high frequency noise ( hfn , or flat top noise , van der klis 1994 ) with large rms amplitudes ( 30% , 2 - 40 kev ) .  and   are characterized by the presence of a @xmath205 hz qpo , and a break ( at ) at 0.1 - 0.2 hz . for , depending on the modeling of the pds ,  @xmath206 hz or @xmath207 hz , and  @xmath207 or @xmath116 hz .",
    "ks1731 - 260 has a very different pds , displaying both very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) and a qpo at @xmath208 hz .",
    "these properties are all consistent with those of `` atoll '' sources at varying luminosities ; the 3 ls sources would be in the `` island '' state , whereas ks1731 - 260 would be in the `` banana '' state , according to the terminology defined by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) .",
    "the high frequency noise is seen only in sources displaying significant hard x - ray emission ( all sources except ) , and hence must be related to the existence of a hot scattering cloud .",
    "this noise in the pds is very similar in shape and normalization to that seen from ls bhs , strongly suggesting that the same physical mechanism is responsible for the spectrum and variability in these systems .",
    "since the spectral shape strongly suggests thermal compton up scattering , then the variability must have something to do with varying either the seed photons , or optical depth , or the dissipation in the hot region .",
    "the overall pds shape can be described by a superposition of randomly occuring flares ( or `` shots '' ) , generally with some distribution of event durations .",
    "such `` shot noise '' models can give a good description of the pds ( lochner et al .",
    "1991 and references therein , miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 , nowak et al . 1999 , olive et al .",
    "1998 ) , but are only a phenomenological , rather than a physical , description of the variability . to get",
    "a physical description requires associating the `` shots '' to changes in the comptonizing cloud .",
    "the simplest variability to envisage is a change of the soft photon input .",
    "thermal comptonization involves multiple scattering of these seed photons on the hot electrons , so the spectrum at lower energies responds first , followed after several scattering timescales by the higher energy spectrum .",
    "such models predict that there should be time lags between the hard and soft energy bands , but that these lags ( which are simply a measure of the size of the scattering cloud ) should be constant irrespective of whether the input variability was a short flare or a longer event .",
    "this directly conflicts with the observed lags in the bhcs ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 ) and the nss ( ford et al 1999 ) , which clearly show longer lags for longer timescale variability ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "a satisfactory explanation of the long timescale lags is difficult .",
    "if the variability arises from varying the seed photons then the length of the lag directly implies that the region is large .",
    "this led kazanas , hua and titarchuk ( 1997 ) to develop the `` extended atmosphere comptonization model '' ( see also hua , kazanas & cui 1999 ) .",
    "this assumes a source of white noise at the center of the scattering cloud which has a density profile @xmath209 out to radii of a few light seconds .",
    "their inhomogeneous density distribution appears to match the observed time lags , and source spectra , but the physical situation is very hard to envisage .",
    "the majority of the gravitational potential energy is close to the compact object , so how can this power a hot corona whose size is many orders of magnitude larger ?",
    "another weakness of that model , is that it produces different pds at different energies , contrary to what is observed ( e.g. nowak et al . , 1999 , olive et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "an alternative model which can fit the pds and time lags but with a small source size has been developed by poutanen & fabian ( 1999 ) . here",
    "they associate the `` shots '' with magnetic flares above a cold accretion disk , and use the spectral evolution of the flares to produce the long lags .",
    "the flare begins with electrons being heated but the background disk seed photon density is high , so the early time flare spectrum is soft . as the heating progresses , the energy dissipated in the flare dominates that of the disk , so the spectrum becomes hard .",
    "the drawback with such models is that they rely on details of the magnetic dissipation , which are not well known .",
    "nonetheless , it is encouraging that at least under some circumstances the lags and pds can be matched by the envisaged small source .",
    "the origin of the @xmath205 hz qpo ( at ) in the ls sources , once suspected to be a bh signature , is also unknown , and is not accounted for by the above models .",
    "chen & taam ( 1994 ) have proposed that they might arise from disk luminosity oscillations resulting from thermal viscous instabilities developing within the inner disk region .",
    "vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have also suggested that they could result from a weak interaction between the `` shots '' when the instability is triggered in a region of stable energy supply . to keep the energy released constant on large timescales ,",
    "the appearance of a strong shot should affect the amplitude and the probability of occurence of subsequent `` shots '' .",
    "recently , developing a model specific for nss ( i.e. not accounting for the similarities between bhs and nss ) , titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ) have associated the qpos with radial oscillations in a boundary layer .",
    "it has been shown that in many sources there exists a strong correlation between  and  ( wijnands & van der klis 1999b ) .",
    "our three ls sources follow this correlation ( olive & barret 1999 ) .",
    "this correlation suggests that the longest fluctuations ( scaling as @xmath78 ) and the qpos are related to the same unknown physical mechanism or are produced in regions interacting with each other .",
    "since the same correlation is observed among bhs and z - sources , this mechanism can not be related to the presence of a hard surface or even a small magnetosphere .",
    "in addition , in several systems ( e.g. 4u1608 - 52 , yoshida et al .",
    "1993 , see however above for ) , a strict correlation between  and the inferred mass accretion rate has been observed . for bhs ,",
    "esin et al . (",
    "1998 ) have speculated that the rapid variability that is associated with the hard x - ray emission could originate from an adaf , with the variability timescales determined by the viscous or dynamical timescales in the adaf .",
    "they have further proposed that the 1 - 10 hz qpos could result from the interactions at the boundary ( the so - called transition radius in adaf terminology ) between the adaf and the outer cool accretion disk , in which case the  would be some multiples of the keplerian frequency at the transition radius .",
    "hence , a shrinking of the inner disk radius ( possibly due to an increase in the mass accretion rate through the disk ) should result in an increase of the qpo frequency .",
    "the correlation between the position of the inner disk radius inferred from the kilo - hz qpo frequency and , observed for instance in 4u1728 - 34 ( ford et al .",
    "1998 ) , is consistent with the above picture . furthermore ,",
    "if  is somehow related to the size of the adaf , the observed correlation between  and  would imply that the adaf contracts when the accretion rate increases ( possibly due to an increase of cooling flux from the disk ) .",
    "finally , in the three sources displaying high frequency noise and a hard x - ray tail , no hfqpos ( above 300 hz ) are detected ( e.g , barret et al .",
    "more generally , it seems that no hfqpos are seen when  is low ( @xmath210 hz ; e.g. 4u1705 - 44 , ford et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the lack of hfqpos might therefore be related to the presence of a hot scattering corona .",
    "smearing of the hfqpo signal in such a corona is a possible mechanism , which is however invoked at higher accretion rates ( i.e. for larger optical depth @xmath211 , cooler corona , brainerd & lamb , 1987 ) .",
    "this might indeed explain the disappearance of the hfqpos after it has reached saturation ( i.e. when the inner disk is at the last stable orbit , e.g. 4u1820 - 30 , bloser et al .",
    "1999 ) , or more generally when the source enters the upper branch of the `` banana '' state ( miller et al .",
    "the anticorrelation between the qpo amplitude and the qpo frequency observed in  ( see above ) is consistent with this picture ( note that there is a weak indication that the optical depth derived from the spectral fitting increases when the source luminosity increases , see table 4 ) . for the ls sources , from the spectral analysis , we have derived an optical depth of a few for the comptonizing cloud .",
    "could that cloud , through smearing , account for the lack of hfqpos ?",
    "using our upper limit , one can set a lower limit on the size of the scattering region . if the radiation is scattered , the rms amplitude at infinity ( @xmath212 ) of a luminosity oscillation with frequency @xmath213 and amplitude a@xmath214 at the center of a spherical region of radius  and optical depth @xmath105 is @xmath215 , where @xmath216 ( @xmath213 is the frequency of the oscillation , kylafis & phinney , 1989 ; miller et al . , 1998 ) . for a beaming oscillation ,",
    "the attenuation is stronger ( due to the fact that the scattering process tends to isotropize the photon distribution ) , and a factor @xmath217 has to be multiplied to the first term of the previous equation ( kylafis & phinney , 1989 ) .",
    "let us first consider @xmath218 hz , from the previous expression , taking @xmath219% ( our upper limit ) , assuming @xmath220 km , one can set an upper limit @xmath40 and @xmath221% on @xmath222 for a luminosity and beaming oscillations , respectively . for a signal at 1000 hz , these upper limits become 12% and 20% respectively .",
    "alternatively , if we assume @xmath223% , for the signal to be attenuated down to our upper limit , the size of the corona has to be larger than 100 km and 130 km for a beaming and luminosity 1000 hz oscillation .",
    "clearly , this indicates that with the low optical depth derived for the comptonizing cloud , and for any plausible sizes of such a cloud , the attenuation is not very strong , and if signal there is , it has to be intrinsically weak .    another possibility which may explain the lack of hfqpos in ls sources might be related to the position of the inner disk radius . obviously , if the hfqpos are generated in the disk , and if the inner edge of the disk lies at large radius ( see below ) , no signals at such high frequencies should be seen . in that respect",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the bump ( around 10 hz ) in the pds of  ( fig.[4pds ] ) was interpreted by psaltis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as a low frequency kilo - hz qpo ( the same bump is seen in  and ) .",
    "their conclusion was derived from the fact that the 0.8 hz qpo and the bump at 10 hz fitted in the global correlation observed over several frequency decades between  and the frequency of the lower kilo - hz qpos ( psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "to first order , the broad band ls spectra of nss can be approximated with a pl followed by an exponential cutoff at 50 - 80 kev .",
    "there is also a weak soft component in 2 of the 3 ls sources , with temperature of @xmath224 kev contributing less than @xmath171% of the total luminosity .",
    "the latter quantities , when derived from the fit of pca data are subject to uncertainties because the fit starts at 2.5 kev , because they depend on the  values assumed , and because there are some calibrations uncertainties of the pca at low energies ( e @xmath163 5 kev ) . however , as for example in the case of , the values derived from our spectral fitting are consistent with the ones obtained from observations that are more sensitive to such a soft component ( e.g. by  or asca , guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 , barret et al . ,",
    "thermal comptonization of these soft photons by hot electrons then appears to be the most plausible emission mechanism for these systems , and for a spherical scattering cloud , the derived optical depths and electron temperatures are in the ranges of @xmath225 and @xmath226  @xmath227 kev .",
    "thermal comptonization also dominates the spectral formation in , but with a significantly lower  ( @xmath5 kev ) and larger @xmath105 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the main difference between a source in the hs and a source in the ls is best illustrated in fig .",

    "clearly for , the bulk of the energy is radiated below @xmath41 kev , whereas for  the energy spectrum is flatter and a large fraction ( @xmath8% ) of the energy is radiated in the hard x - ray band .",
    "there is strong evidence for iron line emission in 2 out of the 3 ls sources examined here ( the evidence is weaker for ) .",
    "the derived line energy is consistent with 6.46.5 kev , i.e. fluorescence from neutral / moderately ionised iron .",
    "there are three possible sites for line emission in lmxbs , the ns surface itself , the accretion disk , and accretion disk coronal wind .",
    "any line from the ns would be strongly redshifted , down to @xmath44 kev , while the accretion disk corona should be strongly ionised , producing iron lines at 6.7 and 7.0 kev .",
    "thus , the most likely origin for the observed 6.4 kev line is irradiation of the accretion disk by the x  ray source .",
    "if so , then it should be accompanied by a compton reflected spectrum .",
    "we significantly detect a neutral reflected continuum in , and a neutral / moderately ionised reflected continuum in .",
    "the reflection albedo , the ratio between the reflected and incident luminosities , is then an _ observationally _ determined quantity from our data .",
    "the reflection probability is determined by the relative importance of electron scattering and photo  electric absorption . at low energies the x ",
    "ray photons tend to be photo  electrically absorbed rather than scattered , so the reflection probability is low , while at higher energies the opposite is true . the photo  electric absorption probabilities are determined by both the element abundances ( more heavy elements mean more hard x  ray opacity and so less reflection ) and ionisation state ( high ionisation states mean less bound electrons , so less opacity and more reflection ) . beyond 10 - 20 kev , the photo  electric opacities become negligible in comparison to the electron scattering probability , but at these energies the electron scattering is not elastic .",
    "the incoming photon can lose much of its energy to the electron as it scatters , leading to a marked decrease in the reflected probability above 50100 kev .",
    "thus , even high energy photons can dump most of their energy in the disk . for hard spectra , such as those seen in , the _ maximum _ albedo , even with complete ionisation of the disk is @xmath228 , while the _ observed _ albedo is much less , at @xmath229 , because the ionisation state of the reflecting material is low / moderate , so most of the low energy incident flux is photo  electrically absorbed rather than reflected . for the hs spectra , such as",
    ", the reflection albedo can be much higher if the disk is completely ionised , since the spectrum is much softer .",
    "this is important because the disk heating and hence optical / uv reprocessed x ",
    "ray flux is determined by the non reflected flux , @xmath230 .",
    "various attempts to derive the albedo from the optical reprocessed flux ( e.g. de de jong , van paradijs & augusteijn 1996 ) give @xmath231 .",
    "this is not in conflict with our values since most of the lmxbs considered were in the high state , where much more of the spectrum can be reflected .",
    "however , we caution that the optical determinations assume that the disk shape is that given by vrtilek et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , with height @xmath232 .",
    "this was derived assuming that the disk is isothermal with height ( central temperature equal to surface temperature ) , which is incorrect ( e.g. dubus et al . 1999 ) .",
    "while the fraction of incident to reflected flux depends on the x  ray albedo ( which in turn is given by the elemental abundances and ionisation state of the reflector and the spectral shape of the incident spectrum ) , the total amount of reflection seen depends on the solid angle subtended by the material , @xmath233 , and its inclination to the line of sight . for an assumed inclination angle of @xmath234",
    ", we derived @xmath235 and @xmath236 in  and , respectively , with an associated iron line eqw of 50 and @xmath237 ev .",
    "the line eqw and especially the reflected fraction are significantly lower than the @xmath238 ev and @xmath239 for an isotropic x  ray source above a flat , infinite disk ( george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ) .      both the broad band continuum spectrum , and its variability ( e.g. van der klis 1994 ; ford et al . 1999 ) and",
    "the properties of the reflected spectrum ( zycki , done & smith 1998 , 1999 ) are very similar to that seen in the ls bh systems , suggesting that the same physical mechanisms operate in a similar accretion geometry .",
    "if so , then the hard emission can not have anything to do with the magnetosphere or the ns surface , and must instead be connected with the accretion flow .",
    "mechanisms suggested for the hard power law in bh systems which can also work in nss are either an accretion disk corona ( magnetic reconnection in flares above a disk ) , or a hot accretion flow .",
    "the lack of a strong reflection signature and weak soft emission is at first sight incompatible with the magnetic flaring model .",
    "a geometry where the hard x  ray source is above an optically thick disk should lead to  @xmath205 rather than the @xmath240 observed here .",
    "in addition , of the hard x - ray flux , half will go up and escape while half will go down and illuminate the cool material .",
    "of these , 10% can be reflected as a hard x  ray component ( if the material is mostly neutral , and has solar abundances ) , but the remaining 90% are thermalised , and should emerge as a soft component .",
    "the soft photon luminosity would then be roughly half of that of the hard component .",
    "however , it is only emitted into @xmath241 solid angle because it is optically thick , and since the hard component is emitted into @xmath242 ; the inferred luminosities of the soft and hard components should be about equal ( see gierlinski et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the properties of the reflected component and line emission together with the observation of time smearing or delays in the optical counterparts of x - ray bursts testify of the presence of an outer disk in those systems .",
    "it would seem however that a significant fraction of the disk can not be seen , either in reflection , or by reprocessing the hard x  ray radiation , or by emission .",
    "so the question is : is there then an inner disk at all , say within @xmath243  ? if not , then the disk corona model can be ruled out .",
    "however , the disk reflection and reprocessing signatures could perhaps be masked by a very highly ionised inner disk ( ross et al .",
    "1998 , but see done & zycki 1998 ) , while the intrinsic disk emission is then cooler and less intense if the power is mostly dissipated in the corona ( svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the hot plasma has a bulk velocity @xmath244 directed away from the disk ( beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "the bulk motion might be due to the pressure of the reflected radiation and/or plasma ejection from magnetic flares .",
    "a mildly relativistic escaping flow ( @xmath245 ) causes aberration which reduces the downward irradiating flux which in turn reduces the feedback of reflection and reprocessing .",
    "perhaps the most telling discrepancy in all these models is that there should also be strong emission from a boundary layer where the disk and ns interact",
    ". the boundary layer emission can be twice as large as that from the accretion disk ( whether standard disk or disk powered corona ) once relativistic corrections are included ( shakura & sunyaev 1986 ) .",
    "there is no strong soft emission component in the spectrum , ruling out an optically thick boundary layer ( unless it also dissipates most of the accretion energy in an optically thin region perhaps powered by magnetic reconnection ) .",
    "king & lasota ( 1987 ) calculated that the boundary layer between a standard disk and the ns can be optically thin only for mass accretion rates much lower than those considered here ( but see recent calculations by inogamov & sunyaev , 1999 and popham & sunyaev 1999 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the disk truncates at the last stable orbit ( allowed only for certain ns equations of state ) then the boundary layer is between material freely spiraling in rather than a disk .",
    "this can give an optically thin boundary layer up to luminosities of a few percent of eddington , as required here ( kluzniak & wilson 1991 ) .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that an optically thin , hot boundary layer could be similar in temperature and variability to disk emission produced by a completely different process of magnetic flare . removing the boundary layer by ejecting the material just before it reaches the ns surface",
    "( e.g. by a centrifugal magnetic field barrier or winds ) is not a viable way around these difficulties .",
    "the observation of x  ray bursts from these systems proves that the accreting material does accumulate on the ns surface ( e.g. ) .",
    "such a series of requirements make the disk corona models seem rather contrived , so we investigate the alternative model where the inner disk is replaced by an x  ray emitting hot flow .",
    "this would naturally account for the weakness of reflection and reprocessing , and the relative weakness of the intrinsic soft emission .",
    "it also provides an explanation for the strong correlation observed between the relative strength of the reflection component ( ) , and the photon index of the intrinsic pl ( ) in seyfert galaxies and galactic bhs ( zdziarski et al .",
    "the same correlation also applies to nss , including those considered here ; for , = 0.15@xmath132 and = 1.72@xmath130 , whereas for , the corresponding values are = 0.28@xmath148 and = 2.09@xmath132 ) .",
    "this correlation can be understood by considering a hot x - ray plasma that fills a variable - radius hole in the inner disk ; as the disk radius decreases , its solid angle increases , thereby increasing both the reflection and the flux of cool cooling photons .",
    "the stronger cooling of the hot plasma then leads to a steepening of the pl slope ( zycki , done & smith 1998 , zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) , leads to a decrease of both  and , and yields a correlation that seems to fit better the observations than the two phase disk model ( zdziarski et al .",
    "another interesting feature of the ejection model , is that it can explain  @xmath246 ( as observed in some seyferts ) because for negative values of @xmath247 , the coupling between the ejected plasma and the disk can be very strong . as said above",
    ", however , the weak point of such a model is that it relies on the poorly known physics of the magnetic dissipation within the disk . ] .",
    "the above scenario , where the innermost radius of the accretion disk moves as a function of spectral state , can also naturally explain the strong correlation between spectral properties and the frequency of the hfqpos ( e.g. kaaret et al .",
    "1998 ; mendez et al . 1999 ,",
    "bloser et al . 1999 ) . while there are several current models proposed for these high frequency features in the power spectrum , they all require that the ns spin beats with an inner disk frequency ( see e.g. the review by van der klis 1998 ) . the easiest way to change the inner disk frequency is to change the inner disk radius",
    "this then naturally explains the lack of hfqpos in the ls nss as being systems where the inner disk is truncated at large radii , where the interaction with the ns surface is small .",
    "as the disk moves inwards , the spectrum softens (  increases ; e.g. in 4u0614 + 09 and 4u1608 - 52 , kaaret et al .",
    "1998 , and the disk contribution increases ; e.g. 4u0614 + 09 , ford et al . , 1997 ) , the hfqpos appear , and their frequencies increase ( piraino et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "how can we reconcile our spectral and timing observations in that picture ?   would have an accretion disk with a large inner radius .",
    "its inner disk temperature is then too low for its contribution to be detected with the pca .",
    "the cooling is low , its spectrum is hard and the amount of reflection is rather small .",
    "conversely , for , the disk extends closer to the irradiating source , the solid angle for reflection is larger and its spectrum is softer . finally for",
    ", the disk gets even closer ; kilo - hz qpos are produced and are seen before disappearing as a response to a further increase of the accretion rate .",
    "the cooling is strong and leads to a quenching of the hard x - ray emission ; at the same time the iron line gets stronger ( so probably , does the reflection component ) . the above picture ,",
    "although attractive , does not explain why , which has spectral and timing parameters more or less similar to  does not display any reflection component ( yet it shows a weak iron line ) . one possible explanation could be that the inclination is larger for  than for .",
    "but what can replace the inner accretion disk ?",
    "the recent rediscovery of a stable , x  ray hot solution of the accretion flow equations has caused much excitement .",
    "the main assumption of these advective solutions is that the gravitational energy released by viscosity is gained mainly by the protons , and that these heat the electrons only by coulomb collisions . for low mass accretion rates",
    "the flow is optically thin so that the coulomb collision rate is very low .",
    "the proton temperature is high , so the flow has a large scale height ( quasi  spherical ) .",
    "the small amount of energy that is gained by the electrons is radiated as cyclo / synchrotron emission , bremsstrahlung and comptonization of these seed photon distributions ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "pure advective models have a disk existing only at very large radii , where its emission is negligible .",
    "the resulting spectrum is then rather hard , since the only seed photons are the self  produced ones in the optically thin flow , and the electron temperature is of order @xmath11 kev ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . as the mass accretion rate increases ,",
    "the flow becomes denser , so the coulomb collisions are more effective at transfering energy from the protons to the electrons , so the radiative efficiency increases . but this process can not continue indefinitely : as the flow becomes optically thick , the coulomb collisions drain all the energy from the protons , and the flow collapses into a standard , optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk ( esin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , there is a clear difference between advective models for bh and ns systems . for bhs",
    "the energy advected with the protons in the flow can be swept invisibly down into the black hole .",
    "such a flow will collapse at @xmath248  where @xmath249 ( yi et al .",
    "1996 ) is the @xmath22 disk viscosity . for nss",
    "the advected energy is released in a boundary layer as the flow hits the ns surface .",
    "if this boundary layer is optically thick , then the increase in seed photons for the compton cooling will cause the advective flow to collapse at eddington scaled mass accretion rates lower ( by at least a factor 3 ) than for bhs ( narayan & yi 1995 ; yi et al .",
    "yet the spectral state transition takes place at roughly the same eddington fraction for nss and bhs , namely at @xmath0  ( see e.g. mitsuda et al .",
    "1989 for the ns 4u1608 - 52 , and for the bh cyg x-1 , esin et al .",
    "1998 , see also esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , and no strong soft emission from a boundary layer is seen .",
    "one way out of this impasse is if the boundary layer is optically thin .",
    "explicit calculations for the boundary layer between an adaf and ns surface have not yet been done , though rather different spherical flows have been shown to give optically thin boundary layer emission up to fairly high luminosities",
    "( e.g. zane et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus an optically thin boundary layer between an advective flow and ns seems plausible . in this case , the boundary layer is an additional heating source for the hot plasma in the advective flow , so it might be expected to merge rather smoothly in both spectral and variability properties with the rest of the hot , optically thin accretion flow .",
    "the extra photons from the boundary layer are then hard .",
    "this lowers the temperature of the advective flow slightly , but the critical mass accretion rate which can be sustained in the flow is then very similar to that calculated for the bh case ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "the one caveat to this is that even if the boundary layer were optically thin then the ns surface would intercept and thermalize some of the boundary layer emission , again leading to an additional source of soft seed photons .",
    "if the ns surface is ionised and/or mainly made up of hydrogen due to settling of heavy elements , then the reflection albedo can be as high as 0.6 .",
    "thus at least 25% of the boundary layer luminosity should emerge as a soft component .",
    "we are currently calculating the effect of such an optically thin boundary layer plus its thermalized emission on the properties of the advective accretion flow , to see whether it can allow the observed similarity in state transition accretion rate between bhs and nss ( done & barret 1999 ) .",
    "it has been recently suggested that mass loss via winds was a natural consequence of adafs , and was such , that only a tiny fraction ( @xmath250 ) of the gas supplied through the adafs was actually accreted onto the central object ( blandford and begelman 1999 , quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "such winds would provide an alternative explanation for the dimness of quiescent bhs , attributed in the adaf models , to low radiative efficiency and the existence of event horizons in those systems ( narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997 ; menou et al .",
    "however , in our picture , where the ns is surrounded by an adaf , the observation of x - ray bursts tells us that all the matter flowing through the adaf can be accreted onto the ns .",
    "so , unless the mass transfer rate is very much larger than currently thought in lmxbs ( see menou et al .",
    "1999 for a recent discussion ) , the presence of adafs around bursting nss would strongly argue against the existence of powerful winds from such accretion flows ( i.e. adios in blandford & begelman 1999 ) .    to summarize ,",
    "the similarity of the bh and ns spectra and variability in their ls strongly suggest that the same mechanisms are operating i.e. that the hard x  ray emission is connected to the accretion flow with the ns surface having little impact on it .",
    "although the latter remains an unescapable part of the system , there is nothing which can be firmly associated with the strong emission expected from the surface or the boundary layer even though it is known that the accretion material has to accumulate onto the ns surface because of x  ray bursts .",
    "this problem applies to both the disk corona and advective flow models .",
    "the boundary layer emission then must either be optically thin , or emitted at too low a temperature to be observed .",
    "the latter seems unlikely given previous asca and  observations , hence we conclude that the boundary layer is optically thin , and hot ( see recent calculations by popham & sunyaev , 1999 , inogamov & sunyaev , 1999 ) .",
    "however , it seems difficult to imagine a situation where the boundary layer emission could have similar spectral and variability properties to magnetic flares above a disk .",
    "hence we favor models where the inner disk is replaced by an x  ray hot , optically thin flow .",
    "the only known stable hot solutions to the accretion equations are the advective flows .",
    "unfortunately adaf solutions have not been developed with self - consistency for the ns case , and it is not yet known whether these can have an optically thin boundary layer .",
    "if so then this emission could well merge smoothly with the hot optically thin advective flow .",
    "we stress that the maximum mass accretion rate at which an advective flow can be sustained holds out the possibility of showing whether or not advective flows can really be present .",
    "observations show that the hard / soft spectral transition associated in these models with the collapse of the advective flow occurs at roughly the same mass accretion rate in both ns and bh systems .",
    "while an optically thick boundary layer produces a large difference in this critical mass accretion rate , an optically thin boundary layer does not .",
    "however , even an optically thin boundary layer produces some soft photon flux from reprocessing of the flux illuminating the ns surface , which will lower this critical mass accretion rate .",
    "further calculations are needed to see whether this effect is small enough to match the observed spectral transitions in nss .",
    "thanks to rxte and , the number of ls nss observed simultaneously in x - rays and hard x - rays is growing rapidly , so that reliable comparisons between bhs and nss can now be carried out .",
    "although , as illustrated in this paper , the most recent data indicate that bhs and nss are very similar in many respects , especially in their low states , it remains critical to search for observational criteria that could distinguish these two types of accreting systems .",
    "heindl & smith ( 1998 ) have pointed out that the index of the power law part of the spectrum is significantly larger for nss than for bhcs ( @xmath251 for nss versus @xmath252@xmath253 for bhs , see however churazov et al .",
    "1997 for an opposite conclusion ) .",
    "the data presented here are in general terms consistent with this claim , but indicates that the separation is by no means large ( the index for  is 1.7 ) . on the other hand , heindl & smith s claim ,",
    "is inconsistent with several recent observations of nss , as for example those of saxj1748.9 - 2021 in ngc 6440 ( int zand et al .",
    "1999 ) or those of the two dippers 4u1915 - 05 ( church et al . 1998 ) and xb1323 - 619 ( balucinska - church et al . , 1999 ) . in the first case , a fit by a broken pl yields a photon index of @xmath254 and @xmath255 below and above the break at @xmath256 kev ( int zand et al . 1999 ) . for 4u1915 - 05",
    ", the broad band 0.2 - 200 kev non - dip  spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody plus a cutoff pl of index @xmath257 ( @xmath258 kev ) .",
    "similarly , for xb1323 - 619 , balucinska - church et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have found that the non - dip spectrum is a cutoff power law with @xmath259 and = 44.1 kev .",
    "based on these observations , we therefore conclude that the above criterion is not valid .",
    "it has also been proposed that , in the framework of thermal comptonization models , the electron temperature of the scattering cloud ( ) appeared to be systematically lower for nss than for bhs ; @xmath260 kev versus @xmath261 kev ( tavani & barret 1997 , zdziarski et al . , 1998 , churazov et al .",
    "this naturally reflects the standard picture that on average bh spectra are harder than ns spectra , and has been tentatively explained by the additional cooling provided by the ns surface , which may act as a thermostat capable of limiting the maximum  achievable in these systems ( kluzniak 1993 , sunyaev and titarchuk 1989 ) .",
    "the data presented in this paper are certainly consistent with this criterion .",
    "however , it is worth noting that there are some speculative bhcs ( e.g. grs1758 - 258 ) for which  derived from the fitting of their hard x - ray spectra with the sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) comptonization model (  in xspec ) is below 50 kev ( @xmath26233 kev in mandrou et al .",
    "1994 from a fit of sigma data alone ) . however , as pointed out by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the latter temperature is probably a gross underestimate , and should be reevaluated using broad band spectra and more appropriate relativistic comptonization models including compton reflection and relativistic effects ( e.g. poutanen & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "if such an underestimate has indeed been observed in cyg x-1 (  increased from 27 kev with  up to @xmath11 kev with ; gierlinski et al .",
    "1997 ) , we note that in the case of ,  derived with  is 30 kev , whereas it is only slightly larger ( @xmath65 kev ) with the relativistic  model ( the same is true for ) . bearing this in mind",
    ", it remains that this criterion should be considered seriously for sources showing evidence for thermal cutoffs in their hard spectra .",
    "more data should tell us soon whether all bhcs fitted with relativistic comptonization models will indeed have  @xmath197 50 kev , whereas all nss fitted with the same models will have  below the above value .    in any case , the above criterion applies when an energy cutoff is observed .",
    "however such cutoffs are not always present in ns hard x - ray spectra .",
    "the first sigma observation of  revealed a non attenuated hard power law ( = 1.8 ) extending up to 200 kev ( barret et al .",

    "a recent  observation of 4u0614 + 09 has placed a lower bound on any exponential cutoff of the power law ( = 2.3 ) of 200 kev kev , piraino et al .",
    "such a value , which puts the cutoff energy above 700 kev , is itself well above the high energy threshold of the /pds ( the last significant data point of the spectrum is at 180 kev ) , and therefore must be considered with cautions .",
    "however , if this result is confirmed by observations performed at even higher energies , it would make the  criterion discussed above definitely unvalid . ]",
    "( piraino et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this means that just as there are two classes of bhs based on their hard x - ray spectra ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) , there might also be two classes of nss .",
    "members of the first class would display hard x - ray spectra with energy cutoffs , which would result from thermal comptonization .",
    "members of the second class would have non - attenuated power laws ( up to an energy which remains to be accurately determined ) , similar to the power laws observed in the soft state of bhs .",
    "such power laws could be produced by non - thermal comptonization , i.e. comptonization on non - thermal particles ( for recent reviews see poutanen 1999 , and coppi 1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , titarchuk et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have proposed that these power laws could be produced by bulk - comptonization in a convergent accretion flow .",
    "the same mechanism seems to be ruled out for nss because it produces spectra much harder than that observed ( @xmath1631 , titarchuk et al .",
    "bhs with power laws have typical  in the range 2.5 - 3.0 , or similar to nss in the hard x - ray band ( e.g. ) .",
    "therefore , the indication of a steep hard x - ray ( e@xmath19730 kev ) spectrum with @xmath197 2.5 can not alone be used to claim that an unknown system contains a ns .",
    "similarly , a hard x - ray power law spectrum with @xmath263 is not unique to bhs ( e.g. 4u0614 + 091 ) .",
    "the idea that bhs and nss are actually hardly distinguishable by their broad band spectral shape has led barret et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to propose a luminosity criterion ( see also barret & vedrenne 1994 , van der klis & van paradijs 1994 ) .",
    "they compared the 1 - 20 kev luminosity ( ) to the 20 - 200 kev luminosity ( ) for all secure bhbs ( by secure we mean bhs with mass function estimates indicating a compact object of mass larger than 3 , hereafter bhbs for bh binaries ) , and all nss detected up to at least 100 kev .",

    "we determine the absolute visual magnitude @xmath265 , according to the values tabulated by popper ( 1980 ) .",

    "shahbaz and kuulkers ( 1998 ) using an empirical linear relationship between the orbital period , the optical outburst amplitude magnitude derived a distance of 4 kpc .",

    "looking at fig .",
    "[ bhnslum ] , one can see that the distinction in luminosity clearly holds : all nss lie in the so - called _ x - ray burster box _ , whereas all bhs are found outside .",
    "this figure shows that comparisons of  and  can be used to distinguish between bhs and nss .",
    "first , although the presence of a hard tail is not a unique signature of bh accretion , the high luminosity in the hard tail appears to be such a signature : only bhbs are observed with @xmath197 , where we define  @xmath267 .",
    "second , the hard x - ray luminosity of nss can approach , but only when @xmath163 . on",
    "the other hand bhbs can have both  and  above  ( although  may then be substantially lower than ) .",
    "finally , the most recent broad band measurements of ls nss as those presented in this paper all indicate that these systems have a ratio /  in a narrow range of @xmath268 .",
    "this yields the correlation between  and  seen in fig .",
    "[ bhnslum ] .",
    "this suggests that below a luminosity @xmath269 , the spectral shape of a given ns does not depend much on its luminosity .",
    "however , observation of softer spectra ( almost blackbody - like , asai et al .",
    "1998 ) from quiescent ns transients imply that this correlation breaks down somewhere between @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "another interesting feature of fig .",
    "13 is the fact that the bhbs ( those lacking an ultra soft component ) lie roughly on an extrapolation of the sequence formed by the nss points .",
    "this again points to the underlying similarity of their emission sources and basic accretion geometries .",
    "we have reported rxte timing and spectral observations of four type i x - ray bursters .",
    "the results presented here nicely illustrate that beside its unprecedented timing capabilities , rxte has also sufficient sensitivity for detailed spectral studies .",
    "our spectral fitting has revealed that the broad band spectra of low state nss are often more complicated than previously thought . in particular , we have detected a compton reflected component plus an iron  line in two systems . in both cases ,",
    "the data indicate that the most likely site for the reflector is a cool accretion disk , which is truncated somewhere to offer a relatively small solid angle to the irradiating source , which could be a quasi - spherical hot advection dominated inner accretion flow .",
    "similar behavior is observed among bhs leading to very similar conclusions .",
    "in addition , within the limitations of the pca calibration uncertainties at low energies , we have detected a soft component , which is equally well described by a multi - color disk blackbody or a blackbody . in our picture , this soft component most probably originates from the truncated accretion disk .    at higher energies , the hexte sensitivity is sufficient to accurately locate the energy cutoff in the low state hard x - ray spectra of these systems .",
    "when combined with pca data , we have shown that the spectral steepness of the hard tails observed by sigma / batse was not intrinsic , but was rather due to the presence of a high energy cutoff ( @xmath272 kev ) .",
    "the cutoff power law spectral shape observed strongly suggests that thermal comptonization is the dominant emission mechanism in these systems .",
    "the comptonization process would take place in an optically thin hot boundary layer merged with the central advective corona , located between the truncated accretion disk and the ns surface .    of the most recent criteria that have been proposed to distinguish bhs from nss ( out of quiescence ) , two appear consistent with all the available data .",
    "the first one states that for nss displaying thermal comptonization , they seem to be unable to achieve electron temperature as high as bhs , and hence comptonization with  @xmath197  50 kev would be a bh signature .",
    "this criterion is weakened however by the fact that there are some nss that do no display high energy cutoffs in their hard x - ray spectra .",
    "the second one is a luminosity based argument and claims that only bhs are capable of emitting bright hard x - ray tails with luminosity larger than @xmath267 .",
    "the rxte archive contain a wealth of observations of nss and bhs in different luminosity states , and represent a very uniform data set , that should be used to test the picture proposed in this paper .",
    "it is also clear that the same data can be used to challenge the observational criteria discussed above to distinguish bhs from nss .",
