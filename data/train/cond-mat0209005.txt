    "ce based heavy fermion ( hf ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) compounds have been the subject of intensive investigations due to their unconventional magnetic and superconducting properties . in these compounds the electronic correlations , the magnetic ordering temperature and the crystal field effects are sensitive to pressure , and pressure induced superconductivity has been observed in a variety of compounds such as cepd@xmath12si@xmath12 , cecu@xmath12ge@xmath13 , cerh@xmath12si@xmath12 and cein@xmath14 steglich79,jaccard92,movshovich96,grosche96,mathur98,hegger00 . the appearance of superconductivity in these systems and the deviation from fermi liquid behavior as a function of pressure are still challenging problems to be studied .",
    "recently , hf systems with the formula ce@xmath15in@xmath0 ( @xmath16 co and ir ) have been reported to become superconductors at ambient pressure @xcite , while cerhin@xmath0 is an antiferromagnet at ambient pressure ( @xmath17 k and @xmath18 mj / mol k@xmath19 ) .",
    "these compounds crystallizes in the hocoga@xmath0 structure with alternating stacks of cein@xmath14 and @xmath15in@xmath12 along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "thermodynamic @xcite , nqr @xcite , and neutron scattering @xcite experiments all show that the electronic and magnetic properties of cerhin@xmath0 are anisotropic in nature .",
    "the af ordering in cerhin@xmath0 is suppressed with applied pressure and superconductivity is observed at 1.6 gpa with @xmath21 k. like cein@xmath14  the bulk nature of the sc state in cerhin@xmath0 has been unambiguously established under pressure .",
    "the af  state is suppressed at a pressure of around 1.2 gpa and coexists over a limited pressure range with the superconducting ( sc ) state @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath10 in magnetically mediated superconductors is believed to be dependent on dimensionality in addition to the characteristic spin fluctuation temperature .",
    "theoretical models and experimental results suggest that sc state in cerhin@xmath0 may be due to the quasi - two dimensional ( 2d ) structure and anisotropic af fluctuations which are responsible for the enhancement of  @xmath10 relative to cein@xmath14@xcite .",
    "a  strong correlation between the ambient pressure @xmath22 ratio and @xmath10 in the ce@xmath15in@xmath0 compounds is indicative of the enhancement of the superconducting properties by lowering dimensionality ( increasing @xmath22 increases @xmath10 ) @xcite . in order to explain the evolution of superconductivity induced by pressure and the suppression of af ordering , it is important to probe the effect of pressure on structure for this compound and look for possible correlations between structural and thermodynamic properties",
    ".    here we report on high pressure x - ray diffraction measurements performed on cerhin@xmath0  up to 13 gpa at high ( @xmath1 k ) and low ( @xmath2 k ) temperatures under both hydrostatic and quasihydrostatic conditions .",
    "as the measured linear compressibilities are similar for both the @xmath23 and @xmath20 directions , the results for all pressure measurements , both hydrostatic and quasihydrostatic , are similar .",
    "the elastic properties obtained from the high pressure measurements are compared to the full set of elastic constants obtained from resonant ultrasound ( rus ) measurements , and excellent agreement is found in the measured bulk modulus ( @xmath3 gpa ) from both techniques .",
    "we find no direct correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath10 as a function of pressure .",
    "rather , a double peaked structure with a local minimum around 4 - 5 gpa is observed for @xmath22 at both room and low temperatures .",
    "cerhin@xmath0 single crystals were grown by a self flux technique moshopoulou01 .",
    "the single crystals were crushed into powder and x - ray diffraction measurements show the single phase nature of the compound . in agreement with previous results @xcite , the crystals were found to have tetragonal symmetry with cell parameters @xmath24  , @xmath25  .    the high pressure x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) experiments",
    "were performed using a rotating anode x - ray generator ( rigaku ) for runs 1 - 4 ( @xmath26 = 0.7093  ) and synchrotron x - rays at hpcat ( @xmath26 = 0.4218  ) , sector 16 at the advanced photon source for run 5 and the low temperature measurement .",
    "the sample was loaded with nacl or mgo powder as a pressure calibrant and either a 4:1 methanol ethanol mixture ( hydrostatic ) or nacl ( quasihydrostatic ) as the pressure transmitting medium in a re gasket with a @xmath27 m  diameter hole .",
    "high pressure was achieved using a merrill - basset diamond anvil cell with @xmath28 @xmath29 m culet diameters .",
    "the xrd patterns are collected using an imaging plate ( @xmath30 mm@xmath19 ) camera with @xmath31 @xmath29m@xmath19 pixel dimensions .",
    "xrd patterns were collected up to 13 gpa at room ( @xmath1 k ) and low ( down to @xmath2 k ) temperatures .",
    "the low temperature measurements were made in a continuous flow cryostat .",
    "the images were integrated using fit2d software hammersley96 .",
    "the structural refinement of the patterns was carried out using the rietveld method on employing the fullprof and reitica ( lhpm)software packages @xcite .",
    "the rus  technique is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .    by measuring the resonant frequencies of a well aligned single crystal of cerhin@xmath0",
    ", we can determine the full set of room temperature elastic constants .",
    "this will give the adiabatic bulk modulus @xmath32 rather than the isothermal bulk modulus @xmath33 found in the pressure measurements .",

    "the hocoga@xmath0 structure in which cerhin@xmath0 crystallizes contains layers of cubo - octohedra of the structural type of aucu@xmath14 and layers of pthg@xmath12 structure type .",
    "the unit cell consists of ce atoms situated at the corners and in atoms at two inequivalent sites .",
    "in1 is surrounded by ce and located at the top and bottom faces while in2 is stacked between ce - in and rh layers .",
    "the hybrid structure is related to both cein@xmath14 and ce@xmath12rhin@xmath34 .",
    "when comparing the crystallographic data and bulk modulus of cein@xmath14 it is evident that the ce atom in cerhin@xmath0 experiences a chemical pressure of 1.4 gpa at ambient conditions hegger00,cornelius00 .",

    "the value of @xmath32 is slightly larger than the isothermal value @xmath33 obtained from the pressure measurements .",
    "this is to be expected as the ratio @xmath43 , where @xmath44 @xmath45 k@xmath7 is the volume thermal expansion coefficient @xcite and @xmath46 is the thermal gruneisen parameter which is typically of the order of unity . at room temperature",

    "as mentioned previously , the hybridization between the ce 4f electrons and the conduction electrons should mainly depend on the distance between ce and its nearest neighbors .",

    "first , the temperature corresponding to the maximum in the resistivity , often taken to be a measure of the kondo temperature @xmath51 is seen to initially decrease in cerhin@xmath0 in contrast to the usually observed behavior thompson93 .",
    "one possible explanation for this effect could lie in an initial increase in the ce - in2 bond length causing an anomalous initial decrease in the hybridization . whereas the plot of ce - in1 bond length with pressure shows a gradual decrease with increasing pressure .",
    "our data is not sufficient to make any definite conclusions along these lines .",
    "the smooth decrease in the ce - in1  bond length would lead one to expect the typical inverse parabolic @xmath52 dependence consistent with theoretical calculations @xcite , measurements on cerhin@xmath0 hegger00,muramatsu01 and most heavy fermion superconductors movshovich96,grosche96,mathur98 .",
