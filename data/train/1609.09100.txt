    "the result is that while some stars have coverage from both bands over 200 epochs , many of the cluster members have only partial coverage .",
    "much of the incomplete coverage of any particular source is due to the changing field of view ; the stars rarely change flux dramatically enough to either saturate or become too faint for short periods .",

    "this indicates that the similarity between the periods of these two sources is a coincidence .",
    "while the stellar rotation period has not been directly measured for these two stars , the observed period is similar to what has been measured in young stellar objects of similar ages @xcite . in the optical , periodic variability is often associated with the rotation of cold spots across the visible stellar surface @xcite , although as discussed above , the size and color of the fluctuations within these objects is not consistent with a spot interpretation .",
    "instead we may be seeing periodic obscuration of the stellar surface by a large warp at a location in the disk close to the co - rotation radius , a scenario that is discussed in more detail in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the other three periodic sources ( # 439 , 530 and 533 ) have timescales ( 32 , 35 and 36 days respectively ) that are much longer than expected from stellar rotation , suggesting that the variability is not associated with motion close to the stellar surface .",
    "all three show strong fluctuations ( @xmath36$]=0.53 , 0.26 , 0.27 respectively ) and have a strong infrared excess ; 439 and 530 are class ii sources , while 533 is a class i source .",
    "the small number of sources prevent any strong interpretation , but we note that @xcite also found an infrared excess to be common among stars with longer periods .",
    "light curves for our three long period sources are shown in figure  [ long_period ] . for stars 439 and 533",
    "there is a consistent shape among the different cycles , while the phased light curve of star 530 highlights the fact that the size of the fluctuations , and possibly their period , vary from one cycle to the next .",
    "the periods correspond to keplerian orbits at distances of @xmath00.2 au .",
    "previous surveys of near - infrared variability have found stars with periods over 100 days @xcite , indicating that long - period behavior is not uncommon among young stellar objects .",
    "the majority of our cluster members are aperiodic , with fluctuations operating on a range of timescales .",
    "even star 530 , which shows significant periodicity , has a long term trend underlying the periodic behavior .",
    "the stochastic nature of much of the variability means that many cycles must be observed before the average size of the fluctuations can be accurately measured . further complicating this analysis",
    "is that statistical tools designed to quantify the size of the fluctuations as a function of frequency , such as the structure function @xcite or lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite , suffer from biases due to the finite sampling and limited observing window @xcite . to accurately quantify the strength of the fluctuations as a function of frequency we utilize recent work in understanding agn variability as laid out in @xcite and @xcite , and contained in the carma_pack software package . in short ,",
    "this code uses a continuous time autoregressive moving average ( carma ) stochastic model to fit the lightcurve .",
    "the power spectrum is then derived analytically from the parameters of the light curve model , avoiding systematic distortions of the power spectrum shape by the finite sampling of the observed light curves .",
    "the bayesian framework for the model fitting includes an accounting of the uncertainties in the data , which is translated into posterior distributions for the model parameters and statistical uncertainties in the shape of the power spectrum . with statistically robust estimates of the power spectrum that are unbiased by the observing cadence we can begin to characterize the relative strength of the stochastic fluctuations on different timescales and use this information to better understand the source of the variability .",
    "in figure  [ psd ] we highlight power spectral density curves that display some of the common behaviors seen among our sample .",
    "the bands in these figures represent the 95%  confidence interval on the shape of the power spectrum , while the horizontal lines represent the noise level of the power spectrum .",
    "we find that almost every source exhibits an increase in power toward low frequencies that is roughly consistent with @xmath37 .",
    "the only source whose power spectrum is not dominated by a power law decline is 691 . in this case",
    "the lightcurve is deterministic and not intrinsically stochastic , thus violating one of the assumptions of the carma model , and we exclude it from our analysis in the context of the carma model .",
    "the power law shape seen in the power spectral density indicates that the fluctuations are not dominated by day to week long timescales , but instead exhibit behavior covering a large range of timescales . within each object , as the timescale increases the size of the fluctuations increases .",
    "previous _ spitzer _",
    "surveys predominately sample frequencies down to 0.03 day@xmath38 , while our data is able to extend down to 0.005 day@xmath38 .",
    "the 200 day day span of our survey prevents us from determining if the power - law shape extends to lower frequencies , although there is evidence for fluctuations over years , as discussed below .",
    "the combination of high cadence and long baseline observations within our survey allows us to derive the smooth connection between daily and months - long infrared fluctuations as seen in the approximately power - law shape of the power spectrum .",
    "the presence of long - timescale fluctuations is consistent with recent spitzer and ground - based near - infrared surveys , although with less dense time coverage . @xcite",

    ", @xcite find variability to be common , with fluctuations consistent with accretion / disk variability to have a longer timescale than those associated with variable obscuration .",
    "these results indicate that even our 200-day time coverage may not span the entire range of the variability , as discussed in more detail below .    on top of the power - law behavior , we also occasionally find sharp peaks at high frequencies .",
    "this is best exemplified in star 623 , where this peak is detected at the @xmath253@xmath40 level , although 1 - 2@xmath40 peaks are seen in other sources .",
    "these features do show up in sources for which the lomb - scargle periodogram indicates periodic behavior ( e.g. 330 ) but , as in the case of star 623 ( discussed in more detail in appendix  [ ots44 ] ) , this feature is not always picked up in our period search .",
    "this may be due to the stochastic nature of the periodic behavior .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram assumes that the amplitude and frequency of any periodic behavior is constant throughout the light - curve , while the carma model is designed for more stochastic behavior .",
    "additional data at a higher observing cadence will help to confirm many of these features .",
    "while our survey only covered 200 days , we can use these data in combination with previous infrared surveys to help characterize the very - long term variability .",
    "previous studies have found year - to - year fluctuations @xcite suggesting that infrared variability is not limited to the timescales studied here . _",
    "spitzer _ was used to survey the chameleon star - forming region in 2004 and 2005 @xcite , covering our field of view , at a similar depth , allowing a direct comparison of measured photometry .",
    "there are 16 sources within our sample for which either the [ 3.6 ] or [ 4.5 ] flux differs significantly between the previous measurements and our survey ( table  [ other_phot ] ) , suggesting fluctuations on decade long timescales .",
    "the prior photometry differs by 0.1 - 0.5 magnitudes from the average of our observations , which corresponds to fluctuations 3 - 5 times larger than we observe .",
    "these larger fluctuations on longer timescales are roughly consistent with an extension of the @xmath37 seen in our derived power spectral density functions , which would predict fluctuations @xmath04 times larger on a nine year timescale than on a 200 day timescale , although more work is needed to confirm this behavior .",
    "year - long fluctuations can also be probed by comparing data taken by the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) @xcite in the cryo and post - cryo ( neowise : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) campaigns .",
    "wise surveyed the entire sky in four infrared bands , of which the shortest two have central wavelengths of 3.4@xmath41 and 4.6@xmath41 , similar to that of _",
    "spitzer_. during its cryogenic campaign",
    "wise observed cha i in february and august 2010 , while the post - cryo neowise campaign observed cha i over four blocks in february and august of 2014 and 2015 , providing a 5 year total baseline .",
    "of the 19 sources in our sample detected in both bands in both campaigns , two show a substantial change in flux between the wise and neowise campaigns , of a few tenths of a magnitude . the smaller number of sources with long - term fluctuations detected by wise as opposed to with _ spitzer",
    "_ is likely not due to sensitivity , both the wise and _ spitzer _ photometry have uncertainties of 0.01 - 0.02 magnitudes , but because the neowise data covers a year - long span , and likely already captures much of the slow fluctuations .",
    "another form of long - term variability is when the size of the fluctuations change over time .",
    "wise can help to address this since it observed cha i during its cryogenic phase in two short blocks , one covering feb 14 - 16 , 2010 and the other covering aug 12 - 17 , 2010 , with a total time coverage similar to our survey . by looking for sources that are variable in the wise data but not in our survey , or vice - versa",
    ", we can begin to characterize the frequency of large changes in the amplitude of infrared variability .",
    "of the 11 non - variable sources in our sample , one ( # 2712 ) shows significant variability ( @xmath42 mag ) in the wise data that if still ongoing would have been detectable in our survey .",
    "the majority of the spitzer variable sources are also variable in the wise data , with the exception of 602 , 523 , 1034 and 1504 .",
    "while the fluctuations in 602 are small ( @xmath00.05 ) and may not have been detectable with wise , the fluctuations in the other three stars are @xmath00.1 mag and should have been detectable with wise .",
    "similarly , comparing the wise and neowise observations there are seven sources that show evidence of variability in neowise , but are not detected as variable in the cryogenic wise campaign .",
    "this suggests that some disks do change the strength of their variability on timescales of years . as with the slow modulations seen between the spitzer epochs",
    ", this indicates that there are further long - term changes in circumstellar disks that are not fully probed by our survey .",
    "whether or not these long - term fluctuations are physically related to the months - long variability , or a sign of distinct processes , is discussed in more detail below .",
    "so far in analyzing the timescale of the fluctuations we have focused on changes in the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] individually , but as noted in section  [ color ] the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color is not constant in all of our targets . the behavior of the color with time may also probe the physical cause of the variability ( ie .",
    "stable spots cause periodic variations in both flux and color ) .    inspecting the light curves of the stars with significant color variations ( fig  [ lc_redder],[lc_bluer ] ) reveals additional trends . in star 1504",
    "there are distinct reddening events at the moments when the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] flux drops , while in star 533 the color shows the same oscillations as the total flux , with the bluest color at the beginning of the outburst . even among the stars that show no overall change in color",
    ", there is structure in their color lightcurve ( figure  [ lc_nocolor ] ) .    applying the carma_pack tool to the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] light curves , we find that the power spectral density has a roughly power law behavior ( figure  [ psd_color ] ) , similar to the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] magnitudes . only star 330 has color fluctuations consistent with the noise at all timescales .",
    "significant fluctuations are only detected on timescales @xmath4350 days due to the small size of the variability relative to the noise , making it difficult to search for the narrow high frequency features seen in the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] power spectral densities . despite these limitations",
    "it appears that the change in color increases with timescale .",
    "this is seen even among sources that do not have a significant average change in color ( stars 360 , 416 , 530 , 601 , and 623 ) .",
    "this can occur if the direction of the change in color , which is not captured by the carma model , varies with timescale ( e.g. extinction dominates on short timescales while disk changes dominate on longer timescales ) .",
    "the derived power spectral densities only apply to timescales up to 200 days , but we can constrain slower effects by comparing our measured color with that of @xcite . we find that eleven stars ( 100 , 330 , 530 , 533 , 602 , 623 , 691 , 966 , 1103 , 2712 , and 4342 ) show a significant variation of color ( 0.1 - 0.6 mag ) over the @xmath0decade between these observations .",

    "the presence of color variations over such long timescales is consistent with increased color fluctuations with time , as was seen with the power spectral density curves .",
    "we find that long - timescale ( 20 - 200 day ) variability is common among young stellar objects and the color changes observed in our sample are consistent with a mix of extinction and disk emission fluctuations .",

    "another possibility is that there are perturbations within the disk , operating at the local dynamical timescale , that lead to observable changes in the infrared emission .",
    "this could include structural perturbations , such as those generated by turbulence lifting dust away from the midplane @xcite , or temperature perturbations , such as collisions between massive bodies that heat up a substantial fraction of the dust , which have been seen to create significant variability among debris disks @xcite .",
    "the key property in this class of models , which distinguishes it from interactions with the stellar magnetosphere , is that they can operate on a wide range of radii , and hence create fluctuations in emission on a wide range of timescales .",
    "their contribution to the power spectrum is only limited by the radii over which a particular process operates , and the range of radii that generate significant [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] emission .",
    "the power law form of the power spectral densities seen among many of the cluster members is consistent with fluctuations arising from a wide range of radii . with our well - sampled light curves",
    "we can see that this behavior is common , suggesting that in - situ perturbations are not restricted to a small sample of young stellar objects .",
    "the color variations in much of our sample are consistent with changes in disk emission , which can arise as the structure of the hot small grains in the upper disk atmosphere rapidly varies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in their surveys of iras:20050 + 2720 and orion find that long timescale behavior exhibits variations in color more consistent with disk perturbations .",
    "the increase in color power spectral density towards long timescales in our sample ( figure  [ psd_color ] ) is also consistent with the increased role of disk fluctuations on longer timescales .",
    "evidence for changes in the structure of the inner disk have also been observed in pre - transition disks .",
    "these systems , with an optically thick inner disk that is separated from the optically thick outer disk by a large gap , have been observed to exhibit seesaw behavior in which the short - wavelength flux increases while the long wavelength flux decreases , or vice - versa @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be explained by a variable inner disk height ; as the inner disk puffs up its own flux increases , while increasing the shadowing of the outer disk leading to a decrease in the long wavelength flux @xcite .",
    "similar scale - height fluctuations may be common in less evolved systems , and present at a wide range of radii , leading to the the infrared fluctuations that we observe here .",
    "in - situ perturbations to disk structure are not mutually exclusive from perturbations associated with the disk / magnetosphere interface .",
    "in fact , stars 330 and 623 both show low - frequency structure in their power spectrum in addition to the more rapid behavior .",
    "extinction may explain the rapid dimming events in star 1504 , but may not explain the brightening during the middle of the light curve .",
    "if extinction operates on short timescales , while disk fluctuations operate on long timescales , the end result can be zero average change in color , as is seen in a number of sources .",
    "which process is more evident in the power spectrum likely depends on the parameters of the system ( stellar mass , accretion rate , etc ) and the timescales being studied in detail .",
    "further work is needed to better understand the details of the perturbations , but our data are consistent with in - situ perturbations at a wide range of radii being common among young stellar objects .    * beyond the dynamical timescale : * in addition to the months - long variability observed during our monitoring campaign , we find evidence for longer timescale variability , stretching out to years and decades , consistent with previous infrared variability studies covering similar timescales @xcite .",
    "the models discussed above all rely on perturbations on the local dynamical timescale ; to reach years would require perturbations out at 1 - 10 au , a region that does not contribute significantly to the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] flux @xcite .",
    "instead , perturbations may be operating at the local thermal or viscous timescales . at the sublimation radius ( @xmath00.1 au ) , where the dynamical timescale is days",
    ", the thermal timescale is 1 - 2 years @xcite and previous models have found that thermal instabilities can generate significant changes in the physical structure of the disk @xcite .",
    "the viscous timescale , the timescale on which significant perturbations to the surface density and accretion rate through the disk can propagate inward @xcite , is hundreds of years at @xmath00.1 au .",
    "these features are more likely to influence the very longest timescales probed , over decades of observations",
    ". more detailed characterization of the years to decades long fluctuations can help to probe these additional mechanisms .",
    "based on _ spitzer _ observations of the cha i cluster taken roughly once per day over 200 days , we find that large ( 0.05 - 0.3 ) infrared fluctuations are common , occurring in @xmath080% of the observed young stellar objects .",
    "we find that the behavior seen in previous _ spitzer",
    "_ surveys , which focused on well - sampled observations over @xmath040 day observing windows , continues to much longer timescales . in examining the properties of the variability , we find that changes in color ( @xmath7[4.5]/@xmath7[3.6]=0.75 - 1.61 ) occur in some of the young stellar objects , and that these fluctuations fall between the behavior expected of extinction and fluctuations in disk emission ( @xmath7[4.5]/@xmath7[3.6]=0.84,1.25 respectively ) .",
    "we find a small handful of the cluster members to be periodic ( 5/30 ) , including three with periods of 30 - 40 days , longer than the typical rotational periods of young stellar objects . with the combination of high cadence and long observing window , we are able to simultaneously sample both daily and months - long fluctuations . with these data ,",
    "we find a smooth increase in power across two orders of magnitude in timescale in almost every young stellar object , with this behavior seen in the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] fluxes as well as the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum indicates that the infrared variability is largest on the longest timescales , with fluctuations @xmath02 times larger over 200 days than over the typical 40 day windows sampled by previous _",
    "spitzer _ variability surveys .",
    "a comparison of our observations with prior _ spitzer _ photometry of cha i suggests that this trend extends out to decades - long timescales .",
    "based on the size of the fluctuations we can rule out the direct contribution of star spots , while perturbations from a companion are possible for the three sources with long ( @xmath030 day ) periods .",
    "interactions at the disk / magnetosphere boundary can explain some of the days to week long fluctuations , while longer months to year long variability is likely a result of structural perturbations to the disk out as far as @xmath00.5 au .",
    "these processes are not mutually exclusive , and can operate simultaneously within an individual system .",
    "whichever process appears more prominent in the light curves depends on the timescales being probed , as well as the intrinsic properties of the system ( e.g. accretion rate , stellar magnetic field strength , stellar luminosity ) .",
    "more detailed measurements of accretion rate , stellar rotation period and inclination could further guide our understanding of which processes are strongest within a given system .",

    "<S> infrared variability is common among young stellar objects , with surveys finding daily to weekly fluctuations of a few tenths of a magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> space - based observations can produce highly sampled infrared light curves , but are often limited to total baselines of about a month due to the orientation of the spacecraft . here </S>",

    "<S> we observe 30 young stellar objects with a daily cadence to better sample variability on timescales of months . </S>",
    "<S> we find such variability is common , occurring in @xmath080% of the detected cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> the change in [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color over 200 days for many of the sources falls between that expected for extinction and fluctuations in disk emission . with our high cadence and long baseline we can derive power spectral density curves covering two orders of magnitude in frequency and find significant power at low frequencies , up to the boundaries of our 200 day survey . </S>",
    "<S> such long timescales are difficult to explain with variations driven by the interaction between the disk and stellar magnetic field , which has a dynamical timescale of days to weeks . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely explanation is either structural or temperature fluctuations spread throughout the inner @xmath00.5 au of the disk , suggesting that the intrinsic dust structure is highly dynamic . </S>"
