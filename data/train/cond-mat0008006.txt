    "if a glass - forming liquid is cooled , dynamic observables , such as the viscosity , the diffusion constant or the intermediate scattering function , show a dramatic slowing down  @xcite . at a certain temperature , the kinetic glass transition temperature @xmath5 , the typical relaxation time of the system exceeds the time scale of the experiment and",
    "the system falls out of equilibrium , i.e. become a glass@xcite . in contrast to these _ dynamical _ observables , all _ static _",
    "quantities , such as the volume or the enthalpy , show upon cooling only a relatively weak temperature dependence for @xmath6 and the glass transition temperature is noticed only by a gentle change of slope in their temperature dependence .",
    "this change of slope is reflected in various susceptibilities , such as the thermal expansion coefficient or the specific heat @xmath7 , as a relatively sudden drop when the glass transition temperature is reached . the physical picture behind this drop in , e.g.",
    ", @xmath7 is that at @xmath5 the structural degrees of freedom fall out of equilibrium and the specific heat reduces to the one of a solid having only vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "hence the height of the drop is usually used to estimate that part of the specific heat associated with the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we see that this type of experiments can be used to probe the dynamics of the structural degrees of freedom , although the information obtained is rather indirect .",
    "since the value of @xmath5 is given by the timescale of the experiment , it can be changed if the sample is cooled with different cooling rates  @xcite .",
    "therefore this dependence opens in principle the possibility to investigate the temperature dependence of the configurational part of the specific heat .",
    "however , since the relaxation time of the system changes very rapidly with temperature , it is necessary to change the cooling rate significantly ( several decades ) in order to see a significant shift in @xmath5 , which is experimentally rather difficult .",
    "an alternative way to probe the dynamics of the structural degrees of freedom by means of the specific heat is to measure @xmath0 , the ( complex ) frequency dependence of the specific heat of the system _ in its equilibrium state_. seminal work in this direction was done by nagel and coworkers @xcite who proposed an experimental setup that allowed to measure @xmath0 also at frequencies as high as 10@xmath8 hz .",
    "independent work in this direction was also done by christensen and others  @xcite .    using their measurements of the frequency dependence of the specific heat ,",
    "jeong and moon were able to predict cooling and heating curves in differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) and found good agreement between their predicted curves and the experimental ones  @xcite .",
    "similar results have been found in molecular dynamics computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus these investigations give evidence that the information contained in the equilibrium quantity @xmath0 allows one to understand also the out - of - equilibrium situation that is encountered in dsc experiments around @xmath5 .",
    "a short review of this can be found in the paper by simon and mckenna  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of the measurements of @xmath0 was for some time rather controversial  @xcite since the origin of the frequency dependence of @xmath0 was not really clear .",
    "some of these issues could be clarified by experiments done by birge  @xcite and menon  @xcite . a partial discussion of this dispute is reviewed in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "very recently nielsen put forward a theoretical description of @xmath0 on purely thermodynamic arguments  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will use a statistical mechanics approach to derive a microscopic expression for @xmath0 and use this expression , which is identical to the one derived independently in ref .",
    "@xcite , to calculate this quantity from a molecular dynamics computer simulation of silica .",
    "interestingly enough this expression has been used before by grest and nagel  @xcite to calculate @xmath0 from a computer simulation of a simple liquid . however , in that paper no derivation was given since it seems to have come out `` from a stroke of genius ''  @xcite .",
    "due to limitations of computer resources the resulting curves for @xmath0 were unfortunately rather noisy , a feature they share with the ones in ref .",
    "in contrast to this , great care was taken in the present work to obtain reliable data , which in turn allows us to compare the temperature dependence of @xmath0 with the one from other dynamical quantities , such as the intermediate scattering function .",
    "thus this permits us to compare the relaxation dynamics as probed by @xmath0 with the one observed by more microscopic methods , such as neutron or light scattering experiments .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will use the projection operator formalism to derive a connection between @xmath0 and microscopic variables . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we will give the details of the model and the simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we will present the results and end in sec .  [ sec5 ] with a summary and discussion .",
    "in this section we derive an expression that relates the frequency dependent specific heat to the autocorrelation function of kinetic energy fluctuations .",
    "furthermore we show how the thermal conductivity can be calculated from the generalization of this correlation function to finite wave - vectors .    for a dense simple liquid under triple point conditions",
    "the only slow modes are the local densities of the macroscopically conserved quantities , i.e. the number of particles , the total momentum , and the energy . for an @xmath9particle system",
    "these local densities have the form @xmath10 where for @xmath11 we obtain the local density fluctuation @xmath12 , for @xmath13 the momentum density in direction @xmath14 , and for @xmath15 the local energy density fluctuation .",
    "( here @xmath16 is the potential energy . ) in the hydrodynamic limit the equation of motion for these densities can be derived by using the exact conservation laws , some ( phenomenological ) constitutive equations that relate the spatial derivatives of the densities to their currents , and thermodynamic relations between the fluctuations of the densities and thermodynamic quantities such as temperature , pressure etc .",
    "@xcite . this approach is valid as long as there are no other slow , non - hydrodynamic processes in the system .",
    "well known examples , for which constitutive equations and thermodynamic relations have to be modified by , e.g. , introducing frequency dependent thermodynamic derivatives , are second order phase transitions or systems with internal degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics of liquids upon cooling is observed on all length scales .",
    "but contrary to second order phase transitions no long range order is building up in two particle correlation functions , since the slowing down of the dynamics seems not to be caused by a growing correlation length .",
    "instead the physical origin for the slow dynamics is the local hindering of the particle motion , the so - called cage - effect , i.e. it is due to a mechanism operating on the _ microscopic _ scale .",
    "however , the consequences of this local slowing down can of course also be detected on mesoscopic and macroscopic length scales , e.g. in thermodynamic derivatives , as soon as the time scale of the experiment is comparable to the time scale of the structural relaxation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a formally exact method to derive frequency dependent constitutive equations and thermodynamic derivatives in the canonical ensemble was introduced , which thus allows to investigate the consequences of the slowing down of the structural relaxation on thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities .",
    "the main technical tools in that paper are thermodynamic response theory and projection operator techniques . in such an approach",
    "the most important physical ingredient is the appropriate microscopic definition of the temperature @xmath17 as a function of the phase space variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 . from a _ mathematical _ point of view",
    "the choice of a such a function is not unique since the only condition one has to fulfill is that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the macroscopic temperature . for the case of supercooled liquids also",
    "_ physical _ considerations impose restrictions to the possible set of functions : in the canonical ensemble the temperature of the system is imposed by an external heat bath . therefore the definition of the phase space function @xmath22 should allow that eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) holds also in the case that @xmath21 is changing on a time scale that is shorter than the one of the structural relaxation .",
    "( such rapid changes occur , e.g. , in the earlier mentioned experiments on the frequency dependent specific heat .",
    "but also for the case of a glass below @xmath5 the concept of a temperature is useful , despite the fact that the true relaxation time of the system is exceedingly large . )",
    "since structural relaxation is related to rearrangements in space , it can be expected that definitions of @xmath22 that involve the positions @xmath23 do not fulfill the requirement of being `` fast '' .",
    "momentum , instead , can quickly be exchanged between particles , and hence is transfered easily through the system",
    ". an appropriate microscopic definition of a temperature , obeying the mentioned mathematical and physical requirements , can be constructed with the help of the kinetic energy of a particle , @xmath24 the canonical average @xmath25 is , as required , the macroscopic temperature @xmath21 . however , if one wants to define a _",
    "density related to the temperature , it can of course not be avoided that there is a dependence on spatial variables .",
    "thus the best one can do is to make this dependence as simple as possible so that it is possible to extract the fast part easily . for a classical system",
    "a convenient microscopic definition of a local temperature field is therefore @xmath26 the canonical average @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the number density .",
    "although it is not a conserved quantity , in supercooled liquids the temperature field @xmath30 has a slow component , due to its dependence on the positional degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the fast fluctuation part can easily be obtained by projecting out these slow density fluctuations : @xmath31 or in fourier space @xmath32 note that by construction this temperature fluctuation does not have any static coupling to functions of the form @xmath33 , i.e. that depend only on the positions of the particles : @xmath34 which shows that its dynamic autocorrelation function @xmath35 can not be proportional to any multi - point density correlation function .",
    "( for later use we have introduced the notation @xmath36 . )",
    "although it is not possible to prove from the ansatz  ( [ eq4 ] ) that @xmath37 is really a fast variable for @xmath38 , i.e. that it does not undergo a structural arrest in the canonical ensemble , this is something that can be checked in simulations and below we will demonstrate that this is indeed the case .",
    "note , however , that the _ time _ dependence of the temperature fluctuations is of course affected by the slowing down of structural relaxation .",
    "this was derived in @xcite within linear response theory . in the following",
    "we will briefly sketch the main steps in that derivation in order to clarify the physics behind the final results .",
    "since in this paper we are interested in the frequency dependent specific heat per particle at constant volume , the first thing to do is to derive a microscopic expression for this quantity and to relate it to the local fluctuations of the temperature . for the sake of simplicity we will focus on the case of temperature fluctuations for vanishingly small wave - vectors , since in this limit they decouple from the single particle density and current fluctuations .",
    "( however , in the last part of this section we will also consider finite wave - vectors . ) to determine @xmath39 we have to calculate , in analogy to the _ static _",
    "case @xmath40 , the effect of temperature fluctuations on fluctuations of the total energy . for this",
    "let us assume that we impose adiabatically at time @xmath41 a ( small ) temperature fluctuation @xmath42 . in this case",
    "the initial probability distribution in the canonical ensemble is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the conjugate field of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    in the linear response regime",
    "the time evolution of any variable @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where the average on the lefthand side is done in the non - equilibrium ensemble ( [ eq8 ] ) , and the one on the righthand side are performed in the standard canonical ensemble ( @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) for the case @xmath50 we thus obtain for the time dependence of the temperature fluctuation @xmath51 and the relaxation of a fluctuation of the energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath52 , is given by    @xmath53    in analogy to the static case we define the frequency dependent specific heat @xmath39 as the coefficient between the fluctuation in the energy and the one in temperature : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the laplace transforms of @xmath57 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    "( the superscript @xmath70 indicates the canonical ensemble . ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) the expression for the specific heat can be read off .",
    "we introduce the projection operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 and use the equations @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the fourier transform of the kinetic and potential energy fields @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the specific heat can now be expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the equilibrium value of the specific heat @xcite per particle .",
    "we emphasize , that eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) is an exact expression for the frequency dependent specific heat at constant volume .",
    "it only relies on eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) as a physical reasonable definition of temperature fluctuations .",
    "expression ( [ eq16 ] ) reveals the physical origin of the frequency dependence of the specific heat very clearly : during the process of structural relaxation the system probes the potential energy landscape .",
    "this dynamics is governed by the ( slow ) relaxation of the densities and their higher order products and hence gives rise to a nontrivial slow dynamics even in the projected dynamics @xmath81 , although the latter does not contain any hydrodynamic poles .",
    "expression ( [ eq16 ] ) is the ideal starting point for approximation schemes like the mode coupling theory .",
    "however , for exact calculations of @xmath39 , e.g. in computer simulations , it can not be used , since it is not possible to implement the projected dynamics . to solve this problem",
    "we will now express @xmath39 in terms of correlation functions that can be measured in a real dynamics , such as @xmath82 .",
    "for this we make use of refs .",
    "@xcite where similar calculation as just presented for @xmath39 were done for @xmath83 , the specific heat at constant pressure , as well as the frequency dependent heat conduction coefficient @xmath84 .",
    "using these results it can be shown that for small wave - vectors the laplace transform of @xmath82 obeys the exact equation of motion @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the frequency dependent bulk modulus and @xmath87 is the particle density  @xcite .",
    "although in general @xmath88 depends on frequency @xmath89 , theoretical arguments show  @xcite that in supercooled liquids this dependence is only weak , in agreement with experimental findings  @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath84 can be replaced by its static value , @xmath90 , where @xmath2 is the equilibrium heat conduction coefficient  @xcite .",
    "note that the form for the equation for @xmath91 is exactly as the one in linearized hydrodynamics @xcite except that now the transport coefficients _ and _ the thermodynamic derivatives are generalized to functions of the complex frequency @xmath89 .    in the limit of vanishing wave - vectors",

    "the value of the constants @xmath137 , and @xmath138 can be found in ref .",
    "the short range part of the potential was truncated and shifted at a distance of 5.5 , which leads to a better agreement of the results for the density of vitreous silica as predicted from this model with the experimental values  @xcite . in the past",
    "it has been shown that this potential is able to reproduce reliably various properties of amorphous silica , such as its structure , its vibrational and relaxational dynamics , the static specific heat below the glass transition temperature , and the conduction of heat  @xcite .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume that this potential will also reproduce well the quantities needed to calculate the frequency dependent specific heat , i.e. the correlation function @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) .    using the bks potential ,",
    "the equations of motion were integrated with the velocity form of the verlet algorithm with a time step of 1.6fs .",
    "the sample was first equilibrated by coupling it every 50 time steps to a stochastic heat bath for a time which allowed the system to relax at the temperature of interest .",
    "( we assumed a sample to be relaxed if the coherent intermediate scattering function at the wave - vector corresponding to the main peak in the static structure factor had decayed to zero within the time span of the equilibration  @xcite . ) after this equilibration we started a microcanonical run for the production from which we determined the equilibrium dynamics at various temperatures .",
    "the temperatures investigated were 6100k , 4700k , 4000k , 3580k , 3250k , 3000k , and 2750k . at the lowest temperature @xmath1",
    "decays so slowly that runs with 30 million time steps were needed to equilibrate the sample , which corresponds to a real time of 49ns .",
    "all the simulations were done at a constant density of 2.36g/@xmath139 which corresponds to a pressure around 0.87  gpa@xcite .",
    "since the temperature expansion coefficient of silica is small  @xcite , it can be expected that a constant pressure simulation would basically give the same results as our simulation .    to obtain also results in the glass at room temperature we cooled the sample from 3000k to 2750k with a cooling rate around @xmath140k / s , and",
    "then rapidly quenched it to 300k .",
    "the so obtained glass was annealed for additional 300,000 time steps before we started the measurement of the various quantities .",
    "since the main observable of interest , @xmath1 , is a collective variable , it has a relatively large statistical error . therefore we averaged all the runs over 200 independent samples for @xmath141k , over 100 samples for @xmath142k @xmath143k , and 50 samples for @xmath144k . in order to make",
    "so many independent runs the system size had to be rather small .",
    "therefore we choose a system of 112 silicon and 224 oxygen ions in a cubic box of size 18.8 .",
    "the coulombic part of the potential was evaluated with the ewald method and a parameter @xmath135 of 7.5@xmath145 .",
    "all these calculations took around 8 years of single cpu time on a parallel computer with high end workstation processors .    as it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the _ dynamics _ of network glass formers shows quite strong finite size effects since the small systems lack the acoustic modes at small wave - length .",
    "thus it can be expected that if we determine @xmath1 for a system of 336 particles the result will be different from the ones for a system of macroscopic size . in order to check the influence of the system size on our results we have made some test runs with 1008 particles and found , in agreement with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , that at long times the dynamics of the larger system is a bit faster than the one of the small one  @xcite .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior of the various relaxation functions are independent of the system size and therefore we can expect that the results presented in this work will hold also for larger systems .",
    "in this section we present the results from our simulation , i.e. the temperature dependence of @xmath1 and the frequency dependence of the specific heat . at the end",
    "we briefly discuss the time and temperature dependence of the generalization of @xmath1 to finite wave - vectors .    as it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) , the first step in the calculation of the frequency dependent specific heat is to determine @xmath1 , the autocorrelation function of the fluctuation in the kinetic temperature .",
    "since @xmath1 is a collective quantity it is relatively difficult of determine it with high accuracy .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a where we plot @xmath146 at @xmath147k .",
    "each of the thin curves corresponds to the average over ten independent samples . from the figure we recognize that even if the shape of the different curves is quite similar , their height varies considerably .",
    "thus one should realize that even if the average over 100 samples gives a quite nice and smooth curve ( bold solid curve ) it still might be subject to a significant statistical error .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b we show the time dependence of @xmath146 for all temperatures investigated . from this figure",
    "we see that for all temperatures this correlator decays within @xmath148ps to a value smaller than 0.2 , i.e. very rapidly . for the highest temperatures",
    "@xmath1 then shows a small shoulder at around 0.01ps , a feature which , at these temperatures , is not observed in correlation functions such as the intermediate scattering function @xmath149 , where @xmath69 is the wave - vector  @xcite .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a definition of @xmath149 ) .",
    "with decreasing temperature this shoulder extends to larger and larger times until we observe at the lowest temperature a well defined plateau which extends over several decades in time .",
    "thus from this point of view @xmath1 behaves qualitatively similar to @xmath149 . since for this quantity",
    "it is customary to refer to this final decay as the `` @xmath4relaxation '' we will use the same term in the case of @xmath1 as well . note that the height of the plateau in @xmath1 is only around 0.1 , which shows that most of the correlation of the kinetic energy is lost during the brief ballistic flight of the particles , @xmath150ps , inside the cage .    from the figure",
    "we also see that with decreasing temperature the correlation function starts to show a minimum at short times .",
    "the reason for this feature is that at low temperatures and short times the system behaves similar to a harmonic solid and thus it can be expected that the connection between @xmath1 and the velocity - autocorrelation function @xmath151 , see eq .",
    "( [ eqa4 ] ) in the appendix , starts to hold .",
    "( we remind the reader that in supercooled liquids the velocity - autocorrelation function shows a dip at short times . )",
    "that this is indeed the case is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , where we compare the two correlators at a high and a low temperature .",
    "we see that for @xmath152k , i.e. in the glass where the harmonic approximation is valid , @xmath1 and @xmath153 are identical within the accuracy of the data ( solid lines ) . for temperatures",
    "at which the system is still able to relax the situation is different . at short times",
    "@xmath1 ( bold dashed line ) shows oscillations with extrema which are located at the same times at which also @xmath153 ( thin dashed line ) shows maxima and minima .",
    "thus the harmonic - like character of the motion on these time scales is clearly seen . for larger times",
    ", however , @xmath153 goes rapidly to zero whereas @xmath1 shows the above discussed plateau before it decays to zero at very long times .",
    "in order to investigate this point in more detail we can make use of eq .",
    "( [ eqa5 ] ) , which relates the spectrum of @xmath1 , @xmath154 , to @xmath155 , the time fourier transform of the velocity - autocorrelation function . at low temperatures",
    "the latter quantity is nothing else than the density of states of the system .",
    "( in order to calculate these fourier transforms we made use of the wiener - khinchin theorem which relates the power spectrum of a time dependent signal to the fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function  @xcite . ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show @xmath154 for a temperature in the melt and in the glass ( dashed lines ) and compare these curves with @xmath156 at the same temperatures ( solid lines ) .",
    "we see that , within the accuracy of our data , in the glass the two curves are indeed identical .",
    "( we remind the reader that the two peaks at high frequencies correspond to intra - tetrahedral motion of the atoms , whereas the broad band at lower frequencies corresponds to ( mostly ) delocalized inter - tetrahedral motion  @xcite . ) for the case of the melt , however , the two curves differ significantly from each other .",
    "although the general shape of @xmath154 and @xmath157 are similar , the former quantity has a much smaller intensity at the two peaks at high frequencies but a higher one in the broad band .",
    "note that this `` excess '' in low frequency modes has nothing to do with the fact that @xmath1 shows at long times a @xmath4relaxation , whereas @xmath153 does not , since at @xmath147k the typical frequencies of the @xmath4relaxation are smaller than 1thz , and their contribution to the spectra can only be seen as the narrow peak at @xmath115 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] )  @xcite .",
    "thus from this figure we can conclude that at low temperatures the harmonic approximation is very good whereas at intermediate temperatures significant deviations are observed .",
    "since @xmath0 is related to the laplace transform of @xmath1 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) , one has to calculate this transform with high accuracy . from fig .",
    "[ fig1]b we see however , that at low temperatures @xmath1 extends over many decades in time which makes the calculation of this transform a non - trivial matter . from this figure",
    "one also recognizes that , despite the large number of samples we used , the curves have still a significant amount of noise , most noticeable at long times and the lowest temperatures , since for these we used fewer samples . since within the accuracy of the data the shape of the curves does , _ in the late @xmath4relaxation regime _ , not depend on temperature , we substituted for @xmath158k that part of the curve which was below 0.02 by the corresponding part of the curve for @xmath159k , after having it shifted to such large times that the resulting curve was smooth at 0.02 .",
    "subsequently the so obtained curves were smoothed and the laplace transform calculated making use of the formula by filon  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the real and imaginary part of @xmath0 for all temperatures investigated .",
    "( in the following we will assume @xmath160 , with @xmath161 . ) to discuss the frequency dependence of these curves let us focus for the moment on @xmath3 for @xmath144k , the lowest temperature at which we could equilibrate our system .",
    "at very high frequencies @xmath3 becomes independent of @xmath162 and has a value of 1.5 , which is the specific heat of an ideal gas .",
    "this result is reasonable since these high frequencies correspond to times at which the dynamics of each particle is not affected by the other ones , i.e. , they move just ballistically . upon lowering the frequency the specific heat rises rapidly",
    "since we are now in the frequency regime in which the dynamics of the system is mainly dominated by vibrations , see fig .",
    "therefore at these frequencies the system can take up energy giving rise to the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "note that before this increase occurs , @xmath3 shows a little dip around 40thz , i.e. , it falls below the ideal gas value .",
    "this dip can easily be understood by the harmonic picture proposed above , because the specific heat for a single harmonic oscillator shows a singularity at its resonance frequency . since in our system",
    "we have many different oscillators that have typical frequencies between 1 and 80thz , this singularity is smeared out and results in the dip and subsequent strong increase of @xmath3 .",
    "the same mechanism is the reason for the little peak at around 5thz .",
    "if the frequency is decreased further , @xmath3 stays constant until @xmath163 is on the order of the time scale of the @xmath4relaxation , i.e. the time scale of the structural relaxation . in this frequency range",
    "the system is again able to take up energy and hence @xmath3 increases again . at",
    "even lower frequencies @xmath3 becomes constant , i.e. , it has reached the value of the _ static _ specific heat .",
    "this sequence of features in @xmath3 can of course also be found in @xmath164 , since the two functions are related by the kramers - kronig relation . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we see that at high frequencies the imaginary part has a peak which corresponds to the vibrational excitations in the system . at much lower frequencies we find the @xmath4peak which corresponds to the structural relaxation process , i.e. the type of dynamics in which particles change their neighbors . for future reference we will introduce the terms `` vibrational and configurational part of the specific heat ''",
    "by which we mean the height of the plateau in @xmath3 at intermediate frequencies and the height of the step at low frequencies , respectively , and will denote them by @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "let us now discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath164 . from fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we see that the specific heat at intermediate frequencies is essentially independent of @xmath21 , since the vibrational motion of the ions is just a weak function of temperature .",
    "the main effect of an increase in temperature is that the height of the flat region at very small @xmath162 , i.e. the static specific heat , increases , and that the crossover from this region to the plateau at intermediate frequencies moves to higher frequencies . at the highest temperature",
    "this crossover frequency has moved up to such high frequencies that no intermediate plateau is visible anymore , which means that in the system there is no longer a separation of time scales for the vibrational and relaxational processes .",
    "furthermore we find that at the highest temperature the height of the plateau at small frequencies has decreased , i.e. that the value of the static specific heat has decreased .",
    "this effect is most likely related to the fact that silica shows a density anomaly , which for the present model occurs at around 4600k  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence just discussed is also found in the imaginary part of @xmath0 in that , with increasing temperature , the @xmath4peak moves continously to higher frequencies until it merges with the microscopic peak .",
    "all this behavior is qualitatively similar to the one found for dynamic observables that measure the structural relaxation , such as the dynamic susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "thus this gives evidence that the observable related to the structural relaxation and @xmath0 are closely connected to each other .",
    "we also note that at low temperatures the form of the curves at low frequencies as well as their temperature dependence resembles very much the ones found in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that in the simulation it is possible to measure @xmath0 even at such high frequencies that the effect of the microscopic vibrations becomes visible .",
    "thus it is possible to follow continuously the evolution of @xmath0 from the microscopic regime to the mesoscopic one , i.e. to investigate the whole frequency dependence of @xmath0 from the liquid state to the viscous state .",
    "in contrast to this , experiments can probe only the frequency range below @xmath167hz and therefore only the @xmath4regime is observable .",
    "however , since experimentally it is much simpler to equilibrate the material also at temperatures close to the glass transition temperature , @xmath0 can be measured at significantly lower temperatures than in a simulation .",
    "finally we mention that we have included in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] also the data for @xmath152k , i.e. a temperature at which the system is deep in the glass state .",
    "we see that this curve follows the pattern of the equilibrium curves very well in that it shows also the `` harmonic resonance '' at high frequencies and then a plateau at lower frequencies .",
    "no second plateau is seen in @xmath3 ( or an @xmath4peak in @xmath164 ) at very small frequencies since at this temperature these features would occur at such low @xmath162 that they are not visible within the time span of the simulation ( or even an experiment ) .",
    "since the part of the specific heat that is related to the structural relaxation is the @xmath4relaxation peak at low frequencies , we will study this peak now a bit in more detail . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show an enlargement of this peak for intermediate and low temperatures .",
    "we clearly see that with decreasing temperature the area under the peak becomes smaller , which means that the configurational part of the specific heat decreases . this temperature dependence might be somewhat unexpected since for other dynamic susceptibilities , such as the one connected to the intermediate scattering function , one finds that the so - called time temperature superposition principle is valid , i.e. a decrease in temperature just gives rise to a horizontal shift of the @xmath4peak  @xcite .",
    "however , since the area under the @xmath4peak is related via the kramers - kronig relation to the height of the step at low frequency in @xmath3 , i.e. the configurational part of the specific heat , it is not surprising that this area depends on temperature , and below we will show that this is indeed the case .",
    "this tendency can also be easily understood from eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) : for this we assume that in the @xmath4relaxation regime at low temperatures the function @xmath1 can be written as @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the height of the plateau and @xmath170 is the typical relaxation time . that this assumption is reasonable",
    "can be inferred from fig .",
    "it is now simple to show that @xmath164 can be approximated by @xmath171 , with a master function @xmath172 .",
    "( here we also made use of eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) ) .",
    "since the function @xmath172 is assumed to be independent of temperature , we see that the whole @xmath173dependence of @xmath164 is given by a shift in frequency proportional to @xmath170 and a vertical rescaling by @xmath174 .",
    "thus we conclude that the configurational part of the specific heat is proportional to @xmath174 .",
    "for the present system both , @xmath169 and @xmath99 , decrease with decreasing temperature , and thus it is clear that the same is true for @xmath165 .",
    "however , in certain materials , such as fragile glass - formers , it is sometimes observed that the specific heat _ increases _ with decreasing temperature .",
    "thus in these cases the temperature dependence of @xmath165 does not have to decrease monotonically , but it might , e.g. , exhibit a local maximum .",
    "although the height of the @xmath4peak changes , its shape seems to be independent of temperature . to demonstrate this we plot in the inset of fig",
    "[ fig4 ] @xmath175 versus @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the location of the @xmath4peak .",
    "since the curves for the different temperatures fall on top of each other , to within the accuracy of the data , we conclude that the shape does indeed not change with temperature .",
    "also included in the figure is the fourier transform of a kohlrausch - williams - watts - law with a stretching exponent 0.9 .",
    "we see that this functional form fits the master curve quite well , at least if one does not go to too high frequencies . at these higher frequencies",
    "the scaling breaks down due to the presence of the microscopic peak .",
    "we also mention that the ( relatively large ) value of the stretching parameter is reasonable , since in strong glass formers the stretching in the structural relaxation is usually weak , and indeed we have found that also for the present model the structural relaxation shows only a weak stretching  @xcite .",
    "further evidence that the structural relaxation and the frequency dependent specific heat are closely connected to each other can be obtained by comparing the typical time scales for these functions . for this",
    "we have calculated the ( incoherent ) intermediate scattering function @xmath178  @xcite for a wave - vector @xmath179@xmath145 , which corresponds to the location of the first peak in the static structure factor  @xcite .",
    "we have defined the @xmath4relaxation time @xmath180 , @xmath181 , by the time it takes this correlation function to decay to @xmath182 of its initial value . to characterize the time scale for the specific heat we have determined from @xmath164 the position of the maximum of the @xmath4peak and defined the relaxation time @xmath183 as @xmath184 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the temperature dependence of these relaxation times in an arrhenius plot . from that graph",
    "we see that the relaxation times @xmath183 and @xmath180 track each other very well in that at low temperatures both of them show an arrhenius law with a very similar activation energy ( numbers are given in the figure ) . with increasing temperature ,",
    "deviations from this law are seen , the origin of which have been discussed elsewhere  @xcite , but also these deviations are the same for both quantities . that the structural relaxation and the specific heat do indeed track each other is demonstrated in the inset , where we plot the ratios @xmath185 as a function of inverse temperature . since we see that these ratios are independent of temperature to within the accuracy of the data , we can conclude that the temperature dependence of the three quantities is indeed the same .    in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we have mentioned that the increase in @xmath3 at high frequencies is due to the vibrational degrees of freedom , whereas the step at lower frequencies is due to the relaxation of the configurational degrees of freedom . by measuring the heights of these two steps it thus becomes possible to determine the contribution of the vibrational and configurational degrees of freedom to the static specific heat and to investigate how these quantities depend on temperature  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where we plot @xmath99 , the value of @xmath3 at very low frequencies which is hence the static specific heat , @xmath165 , the height of the step in @xmath3 at low frequencies , and @xmath166 , the value of @xmath3 at intermediate frequencies .",
    "several observations can be made : firstly , @xmath166 shows a very regular temperature dependence which can be approximated well by a linear function of temperature , at least in the temperature range investigated .",
    "an extrapolation of this temperature dependence to lower temperatures shows that @xmath166 attains the harmonic value of 3@xmath186 only at low temperatures ( @xmath187  1000k ) , i.e. at temperatures that are well below the ( experimental ) glass transition temperature , which is at 1450k  @xcite , a value that seems to be reproduced reasonably well by the present model  @xcite .",
    "hence we find that @xmath166 is affected by anharmonic effects even at relatively low temperatures .",
    "we also mention that the vibrational part @xmath166 in the temperature range 2750k  @xmath188  3500k seems to be in nice agreement with a _ linear _ extrapolation of the experimental specific heat of the glass below @xmath189k to higher temperatures , i.e. if one leaves out the increase of the specific heat due to the glass transition .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath165 is much more pronounced in than the one of @xmath166 , in that it shows around 4000k a crossover from a relatively weak temperature dependence at high @xmath21 to a stronger one at low @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore we see that @xmath165 is significantly smaller than @xmath166 , which is in agreement with the experimental result that strong glass formers show only a small drop in the specific heat when the temperature is lowered below the glass transition temperature , i.e. when the relaxational degrees of freedom are frozen  @xcite .",
    "we also note that for a strong glass former one expects that the kauzmann temperature @xmath190 is very small  @xcite . from the figure it seems however , that a naive extrapolation of @xmath165 to lower temperatures leads to a intercept with the temperature axis around @xmath191k .",
    "since the inequality @xmath192 must hold , this type of extrapolation thus leads to an estimate of @xmath193k .",
    "this high estimate of @xmath190 is corroborated by recent results of the same model in which @xmath190 was estimated by the direct calculation of the entropy and a subsequent extrapolation to lower temperatures  @xcite .",
    "these results for @xmath190 depend of course crucially on the way @xmath194 is extrapolated to lower temperatures . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] it is clear that it is also possible to make this extrapolation in such a way that , e.g. , at @xmath195k its value is around 0.5@xmath186/particle , i.e. equal to the height of the step in the experimental curve at @xmath5 ( see experimental curves in figure )  @xcite .",
    "if the extrapolation is done in this way , the estimate of @xmath196 is moved to much lower temperatures .",
    "thus it will be very interesting to attempt to do simulations at even lower temperatures in order to minimize the effects of this extrapolation .",
    "for this it will of course be necessary to equilibrate the system at even lower temperatures , which is computationally difficult .",

    "some time ago zwanzig proposed ( essentially ) the following mechanism for the @xmath173dependence of @xmath212  @xcite : a change in temperature will in general give rise to a change in density ( since most real experiments are done at constant pressure and not density ) . due to the high value of the bulk viscosity , this volume relaxation will be slow and occur on the time scale of the @xmath4relaxation , and hence @xmath213 will be frequency dependent . since in turn",
    "the frequency dependence of the viscosity is due to the slow relaxation of the structure on the microscopic scale , zwanzig thus argued that the reason for the @xmath173dependence of @xmath212 is just an _ indirect _ effect of the slow microscopic dynamics . since in a system with constant volume",

    "<S> we apply the mori - zwanzig projection operator formalism to obtain an expression for the frequency dependent specific heat @xmath0 of a liquid . by using an exact transformation formula due to lebowitz _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the autocorrelation function of temperature fluctuations in the microcanonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> this connection thus allows to determine @xmath0 from computer simulations in equilibrium , i.e. without an external perturbation . by considering the generalization of @xmath1 to finite wave - vectors </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an expression to determine the thermal conductivity @xmath2 from such simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of extensive computer simulations in which we use the derived relations to determine @xmath0 over eight decades in frequency , as well as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the system investigated is a simple but realistic model for amorphous silica . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at high frequencies the real part of @xmath0 has the value of an ideal gas . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 increases quickly at those frequencies which correspond to the vibrational excitations of the system . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 shows a second step . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency at which this step is observed is comparable to the one at which the @xmath4relaxation peak is observed in the intermediate scattering function . </S>",
    "<S> also the temperature dependence of the location of this second step is the same as the one of the @xmath4peak , thus showing that these quantities are intimately connected to each other . </S>",
    "<S> from @xmath3 we estimate the temperature dependence of the vibrational and configurational part of the specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the static value of @xmath0 as well as @xmath2 are in good agreement with experimental data . </S>"
