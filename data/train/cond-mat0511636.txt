    "contact angle hysteresis on a real surface has been investigated experimentally for many years  @xcite .",
    "usually a higher advancing contact angle and a lower receding contact angle are observed .",
    "this hysteresis has been attributed either to the roughness  @xcite or to the chemical heterogeneity  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "chemical heterogeneity is most important for smooth surface .",
    "it also plays a crucial role for the morphology and motion of a small droplet  @xcite on a smooth surface which has attracted much attention recently for its potential use in microfluidic devices  @xcite .    on a chemically heterogeneous surface , cassie s law  @xcite for the apparent contact angle  @xcite of a macroscopic droplet",
    "is adopted for the design issue of the microfluidic devices in chemical and biomedical engineering .",
    "for example , this law is successfully used to explain the superhydrophobicity and self - cleaning mechanism of various natural and artificial surfaces  @xcite .",
    "this cassie s law states that the apparent contact angle of the droplet is given by the aerial average of the local contact angles about the droplet base .",
    "therefore , the contact angle hysteresis can not be explained using this law .    in a previous paper  @xcite",
    "we argued that the cassie s law can be used to predict the _ observed _ contact angle only if the heterogeneity is of molecular size . for macro- and micro - sized heterogeneity ,",
    "we have derived , using the so - called interface displacement model  @xcite , the modified cassie s law , which is similar but clearly different from the original cassie s law .",
    "our modified cassie law predicts that the left and the right contact angle of the cylindrical droplet must be equal to minimize the total free energy . using this principle derived from the modified cassie s law and the constraint on the volume",
    ", we can examine the behavior of the contact angle as the volume of the droplet is increased or decreased .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss a simplified model for a translationally symmetric cylindrical droplet on a heterogeneously striped but smooth surface  @xcite , and examine the hysteresis of the contact angle of the droplet as its volume is controlled externally .",
    "although a more realistic three - dimensional calculation has already been reported  @xcite , we believe that even a simplified model can provide a more profound and a new insight into the well - known hysteresis problem .    the format of this paper is as follows : in section2 , we will present the minimum of modified cassie s law  @xcite using a simplified model  @xcite . in section 3 , we will use this modified cassie s law as a vehicle to study the contact angle hysteresis of the liquid droplet on a chemically heterogeneous striped surface .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "since the modified cassie s law was derived previously  @xcite , we will give a minimal form of the formula which is necessary to discuss the contact angle hysteresis .",
    "we consider a cylindrical droplet of the base length @xmath0 and the apparent contact angle @xmath1 with circular meniscus of radius @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) which can move freely along the heterogeneously striped surface .",
    "the size of the droplet considered is macroscopic so that the molecular - scale liquid - vapor interfacial width is smaller than the scale of surface heterogeneity  @xcite , yet it is smaller than the capillary length which is of the order of few mm so that the gravity is negligible  @xcite .",
    "one should minimize the free energy of droplet given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the liquid - fluid ( vapor ) , the solid ( surface)-liquid , and solid - fluid surface tensions respectively .",
    "the left edge of the droplet is at @xmath7 and the right edge at @xmath8 .",
    "now , writing the surface free energy using the local contact angle @xmath9 at @xmath10 defined by the young s equation  @xcite : @xmath11 we find @xmath12 which should be minimized with respect to the apparent contact angle @xmath1 and the position @xmath7 of the droplet ( see fig . [ fig:1 ] ) subject to the condition of the constant volume @xmath13 ( which is actually the cross section ) : @xmath14 which gives the relation between the base length @xmath15 and the contact angle @xmath1 : @xmath16     coordinate .",
    "the left edge of the droplet is at @xmath7 and the right edge at @xmath8 .",
    "if the left and the right contact angle is different , the drop is dragged by the surface from lyophobic ( less wettable with a higher contact angle ) toward lyophilic ( more wettable with a lower contact angle ) part . ]    by minimizing ( [ eq:3 - 3 ] ) with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath15 through ( [ eq:3 - 4 ] ) , one obtains @xmath17this equation should be augmented by the condition that the position @xmath7 of the droplet becomes the minimum of the free energy .",
    "this condition is derived by minimizing the above free energy ( [ eq:3 - 3 ] ) with respect to the position @xmath7 , which leads to @xmath18    when the droplet can move freely , it will move to a position where the local contact angle @xmath19 of the left edge and @xmath20 of the right edge become equal .",
    "this condition has a simple mechanical meaning since eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 - 7 ] ) can be written as @xmath21 from young s equation . since eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 - 8 ] ) represents the balance of the net force exerted from the substrate at the left and the right edge of the droplet , the minimum total free energy implies the force balance . this is a natural condition of static ( non - moving ) droplet .",
    "therefore a thermodynamic equilibrium is realized when the mechanical balance is satisfied  @xcite .",
    "when this condition is violated , the droplet can move freely .",
    "for example , if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 therefore the force exerted from the surface at the right edge @xmath8 is stronger than the one at the left edge @xmath7 , and the droplet moves to the right toward the area of lower contact angle .",
    "therefore , the droplet moves from the lyophobic part to the lyotropic part of the surface .",
    "such a force unbalance is widely used to create freely moving microscopic droplets  @xcite    combining eqs.([eq:3 - 6 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 - 7 ] ) , we arrive at the modified cassie s law : @xmath24 and eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 - 7 ] ) , which is similar , but completely different from the original cassie s law  @xcite . therefore , the apparent contact angle @xmath1 should be given by the local contact angle @xmath19 at the left and @xmath20 at the right edge of the droplet .",
    "all three must be equal for an equilibrium droplet .",
    "no averaging such as the original cassie s law  @xcite can be used to predict the _ observed _ apparent contact angle unless the heterogeneity is of a nanoscopic molecular size  @xcite .",
    "from the modified cassie s law ( [ eq:3 - 7 ] ) of the previous section , it is natural to assume that the droplet occupies a position where the local contact angle of the left edge @xmath19 is equal to that of the right edge @xmath20 . using this simple rule and a model of a cylindrical droplet on a periodically striped surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , we will consider the contact angle hysteresis on a chemically heterogeneous striped surface . a similar model with a sinusoidally modulated heterogeneous surface rather than a striped surface",
    "was examined  @xcite .",
    "however , there is one important factor missing for such a continuous heterogeneity .",
    "namely the surface pinning at the interface of stripes , which could play a crucial role in various morphological phase transitions on the surface  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the striped surface would be more realistic than the sinusoidally modulated surface considered by marmur and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "johnson and dettre  @xcite also considered a similar striped model but they considered an axisymmetric semi - spherical droplet .",
    "striped heterogeneity was also considered by neumann and good  @xcite but they only considered the capillary rise along striped wall .    the heterogeneous surface model which we used in this study is depicted in fig .  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the surface consists of two types of stripes that are periodically arranged .",
    "the stripes are aligned parallel to the axis of the cylindrical droplet .",
    "the surface `` a '' of width @xmath25 is characterized by the intrinsic contact angle @xmath26 , and `` b '' of width @xmath27 is characterized by @xmath28 . at the ab interface , however , the droplet is pinned , and the apparent contact angel @xmath1 can take any values between @xmath26 and @xmath28  @xcite to satisfy the volume constraint : @xmath29 the origin of the coordinate is chosen at the center of one of the stripes of type `` a '' .     and @xmath27 .",
    "the droplet sits at the center .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that the a surface is at the center .",
    "the droplet is characterized by the contact angle .",
    "we call the droplet type - a when its contact angle is @xmath26 and type - b when it is @xmath28 .",

    "we will call the droplet type - a if its left and right contact angles are @xmath26 , and type - b if they are @xmath28 .",

    "( [ eq:4 - 1 ] ) . from now on , we will call ( ab ) interface when the droplet edge moves from a to b surface and ( ba ) interface when the droplet edge moves from b to a surface on increasing the size of droplet . at these two types of interface",
    ", we may expect a sudden jump of the droplet edge by a finite length or the continuous changes of contact angle on increasing or decreasing the droplet volume .",

    "the droplet should be equal for the thermodynamically equilibrium droplet .",

    "thus , for a static droplet , the local contact angle of the left and the right edge must be equal .",
    "this force balance condition explains moving and driving a micro - droplet along the surface .    using the above condition that the contact angles at the left and the right edge must be equal , we have examined the behavior of the droplet on a periodically striped surface composed of a and b surfaces when we control the volume of droplet .",
    "it has been shown that the complex hysteresis is expected on such a striped surface .",
    "for example the edge of the droplet jump to a finite width or the contact edge is pinned at ( ab ) and ( ba ) interface and the contact angle changes continuously .",
    "it is generally expected that only the droplet with a larger contact angle appears when we increase the volume of droplet , while only the droplet with smaller contact angle appears when we decrease the volume .",
    "therefore , our model is consistent with the observation that the advancing contact angle is usually higher than the receding contact angle  @xcite .",
    "given the recent advancement of the nanomaterial , such a striped surface could be achieved experimentally and the hysteresis of the contact angle could also be observed .    in our report",
    ", we used the argument based on the free energy of droplet with cylindrical shape .",
    "the free energy barrier and the vibration state due to the deformation of the droplet discussed by johnson and dettre  @xcite are beyond the scope of the present work , which could play some role during the jumping motion of the droplet edge .",
    "we also restricted our discussion to the macro- and microscopic droplet , and the macroscopic apparent contact angle is considered , which could be observed using a microscope . in order to study the nanoscopic contact angle of a nanoscopic droplet  @xcite , which could be observed , for example , using an atomic force microscope ( afm )  @xcite , we have to include the thin film potential .",
