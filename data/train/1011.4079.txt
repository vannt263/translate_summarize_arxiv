    "magnetars are isolated neutron stars ( ns ) powered by extreme magnetic fields ( @xmath9g)@xcite . the magnetar model explains the observed properties of two classes of rare objects , the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) : compact x - ray sources with long rotation periods and rapid spindowns which sporadically emit short ( @xmath10s ) bursts of soft gamma rays ( for a review see @xcite . ) fewer than twenty sgrs and axps are known .",
    "the total isotropic burst energies rarely exceed @xmath11erg",
    ". however , three extraordinary `` giant flares '' ( gfs ) have been observed in @xmath1230 years from sgrs in our galaxy and the large magellanic cloud : one from sgr 0526@xmath266 in 1979 with an observed total isotropic energy of @xmath13erg@xcite ; one from sgr 1900 + 14 in 1998 with @xmath14erg@xcite ; and a spectacular one from sgr 1806@xmath220 in 2004 with @xmath15erg @xcite where @xmath16 .",
    "there is also evidence that some short gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) were in fact extragalactic gfs .",
    "grb 070201 might have been a gf located in the andromeda galaxy with an isotropic energy of @xmath17erg@xcite ; and grb 051103 might have been a gf in m81 with an energy of @xmath18erg@xcite .    although still poorly understood , magnetars are promising candidates for the first direct gravitational wave ( gw ) detection for several reasons .",
    "first , a sudden localized energy release could excite non - radial pulsational ns modes .",
    "bursts may be caused by untwisting of the global interior magnetic field and associated cracking of the solid ns crust@xcite , or global reconfiguration of the internal magnetic field and associated deformation of the ns hydrostatic equilibrium@xcite .",
    "the lowest- order gw emitting mode , the @xmath0-mode , is damped principally via gw emission and would ring down with a predicted damping time of 100400ms and with a frequency in the 13khz range depending on the nuclear equation of state and ns composition @xcite , putting these signals in the band of interferometric gw detectors ( see figure[fig : noise ] ) .",
    "second , precise sky locations and trigger times from electromagnetic ( em ) bursts allow us to reduce the false - alarm rate and increase sensitivity relative to all - sky all - time searches such as@xcite . finally , magnetars are among the closest of potential gw burst sources .",
    "gw signals from magnetars would give us a new window through which to probe the stellar physics and structure .",
    "however , quantitative predictions or constraints on the amplitude of gw emission associated with magnetar bursts are relatively few and highly uncertain ( see e.g.@xcite ) ; hence it is not clear when we might begin to expect a detection .",
    "it may turn out that the magnetar burst mechanism does not excite global ns @xmath0-modes .",
    "if the outburst dynamics are confined to surface layer modes , the crust torsional oscillations might emit gws at frequencies of @xmath19hz@xcite . it is also possible that although the crust is a plausible site for triggering , bursts are confined to the magnetosphere@xcite , although even in this case @xmath0-modes might be excited either directly or via crust / core hydromagnetic coupling .",
    "finally we note that it is not yet clear if gfs and common bursts are caused by the same mechanism .",
    "the lack of theoretical understanding underlines the importance of observational constraints on gw emission .",
    "we present results from a search for gw bursts associated with magnetar em bursts using data from the second year of ligo s fifth science run ( s5y2 , @xcite ) ; virgo s first science run ( vsr1 , @xcite ) ; and the subsequent ligo and geo _ astrowatch _ period ( a5 ) , during which the principal goal was detector commissioning , not data collection .",
    "the s5y2 epoch involved the three ligo detectors : a 4 km interferometer in louisiana and two interferometers ( 4 km and 2 km ) in washington .",
    "the vsr1 epoch added the virgo 3 km detector to the global network .",
    "the a5 epoch included only the ligo 2 km detector and the geo 600 m detector@xcite .",
    "the virgo and geo600 detectors are located in italy and germany , respectively .",
    "this is the third search for gws from magnetars sensitive to @xmath0-mode ringdowns .",
    "the first@xcite included the 2004 sgr 1806@xmath20 gf , a 2006 storm of bursts from sgr 1900 + 14 , and 188 other events from sgrs 1806@xmath220 and 1900 + 14 occurring before november 2006 .",
    "upper limits on @xmath0-mode gw energy emission at 1090hz ranged from @xmath21erg to @xmath22erg , and upper limits on band- and time - limited white noise bursts at 100200hz ranged from @xmath23erg to @xmath24erg .",
    "the second@xcite focused on the 2006 sgr 1900 + 14 storm , `` stacking '' gw data corresponding to individual bursts in the storm s em lightcurve@xcite .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath0-mode emission at 1090hz of @xmath25erg per burst was set on a stack of the 11 brightest storm bursts , an order of magnitude lower than the unstacked limit on the storm .    during the s5y2 , vsr1 and a5 epochs of the search we present here ,",
    "1217 soft gamma - ray bursts from six magnetars were listed by the interplanetary network of satellites or ipn ( table[table : magnetars ] and figure[fig : activity ] ) .",
    "four of the sources are being examined for gw signals for the first time .",
    "two of those ( sgr 0501 + 4516 and sgr 0418 + 5729 ) are thought to be much closer to earth than sgrs examined in previous gw searches .",
    "sgr 0501 + 4516 might be associated with the supernova remnant hb9@xcite , which is @xmath26pc from earth @xcite ; proper motion measurements could exclude this association .",
    "the probable locations of both sgr 0501 + 4516 and sgr 0418 + 5729 in the perseus arm of our galaxy imply distances of @xmath1212kpc@xcite .",
    "axp 1e 1547.0@xmath25408 ( also known as sgr 15505418 ) gave two exceptional bursts on 2009 january 22 .",
    "observations of expanding rings around the source , caused by x - ray scattering off dust sheets , set the source distance at 45kpc and imply an em energy for one or both of these `` ring event '' bursts of @xmath27erg@xcite , comparable to the gfs .",
    "in addition to the ipn triggers , we include eight triggers from the fermi gbm detector : seven bright axp 1e 1547.0@xmath25408 bursts and one sgr 0418 + 5729 burst .",
    "we also identified 54 individual peaks in a storm from sgr 1627@xmath241 lasting @xmath28s by combining the 1525kev and 2550kev swift / bat 64ms",
    "- binned light curves and selecting peaks above 450 counts / 64 ms .",
    "the search thus includes a grand total of 1279 em triggers .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : magnetars ]",
    "we analyze magnetar bursts using the strategy from@xcite , which is less dependent on a particular emission model than the stacking approach of@xcite .",
    "the analysis is performed by the flare pipeline@xcite , which produces a time - frequency excess power pixel map from calibrated detector data streams in the fourier basis .",
    "pixels are characterized by excess power relative to the background ( `` loudness '' ) and loud adjacent pixels are grouped into `` events . ''",
    "the generalized pipeline accepts arbitrary networks of gw detectors by including detector noise floor measurements and antenna responses in the detection statistic@xcite .",
    "we divide the search into three frequency bands : 13khz where @xmath0-modes are predicted to ring ; and 100200hz and 1001000hz .",
    "we include the latter two frequency bands in order to search also at lower frequencies where the detectors are most sensitive ( see figure[fig : noise ] ) . although there are no predictions of gw _ burst _ signals from magnetars at these lower frequencies , we note that quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) , lasting for tens of seconds and possibly associated with stellar torsional modes , have been observed in gf em tails at frequencies as low as 18hz and as high as 1800hz@xcite .",
    "qpos in the tail of the 2004 gf were targeted by a tailored gw search@xcite distinct from the one presented here .",
    "as in@xcite , we choose 4s signal regions centered on each em trigger time",
    ". delays between em and gw emission are unlikely to be significant@xcite ; the 4s duration accounts for uncertainties in the geocentric em peak time due e.g. to satellite triggering algorithms and rounding .",
    "overlapping signal regions are merged .",
    "we analyze 1000s of background on either side of each signal region ( 2000s total ) in order to estimate the significance of events in that signal region .",
    "background regions are not necessarily continuous , as we require the same detector network coverage and data quality as for the signal region ; in addition , signal regions of other magnetar bursts are masked out .",
    "signal and background regions are chosen after data quality cuts have been applied to the gw data , so as to remove data segments coincident with instrumental or data acquisition problems , or excessive noise due to challenging environmental conditions .",
    "for the s5y2 portion of this search , we applied category 1 and 2 data quality cuts ( i.e.  cutting only data certain to be unfit for analysis ) as described in@xcite . for a5 , which focused on detector commissioning ,",
    "the boolean `` science mode '' designator and other basic data quality treatments were applied to the data , but the full categorical data quality treatment was not performed .",
    "statistically significant events in the signal regions from any epoch are subject to follow - up investigations before being considered detection candidates",
    ". follow - ups might include correlation with environmental data channels and more refined estimates of significance .",
    "we set model - dependent upper limits on @xmath0-mode ringdowns with circular and linear polarizations and frequencies sampling the range for @xmath0-modes ( 13khz , which accounts for plausible ns equations of states and magnetic fields ) , and with a decay time constant of @xmath29ms .",
    "we observed no more than 15% degradation in strain upper limits using ringdowns with @xmath30 in the range 100300ms as compared to the nominal value of 200ms .",
    "we set additional limits on band- and time- limited white noise bursts with 11ms and 100ms durations ( motivated by observed rise times and durations of magnetar burst light curves ) spanning the 100200hz and 1001000hz search bands .",
    "while these frequencies are chosen principally to explore the detectors most sensitive region below the @xmath0-mode frequencies , the observed range of qpo frequencies provides astrophysical motivation .",
    "upper limits depend on the frequency sensitivity of the detectors ( figure [ fig : noise ] ) .",
    "simulations are constructed using knowledge of the target magnetar s sky location and the em burst time .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the two gw polarizations .",
    "the relationship between the gw polarizations and the detector response @xmath34 to gw signals arriving from an altitude and azimuth @xmath35 and with polarization angle @xmath36 is : h(t ) = f^+ ( , , ) h_+(t ) + f^ ( , , ) h_(t ) , [ eq : hsim ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the antenna functions for the source at @xmath35 .",
    "the polarization angle for each simulation was randomly chosen from a flat distribution between 0 and 2@xmath39 .",

    "we determine the loudest event in the signal region .",
    "2 .   for a specific simulated signal type",
    ", we inject a simulation at a specific @xmath40 and @xmath41 in a randomly selected 4s interval of the background data and find events in that region .",

    "[ item : inject ] 3 .",
    "we repeat ( [ item : inject ] ) for a range of @xmath40 and @xmath41 values , and at each value we determine the fraction of injections with associated events louder than the loudest signal region event . [",

    "we repeat ( [ item : repeat ] ) using different simulated signal types . for each signal type",
    ", we estimate the 90% detection efficiency loudest event upper limit , @xmath42 or @xmath43 , at which 90% of injection events would be louder than the loudest signal region event .",
    "we find no evidence of a gw signal in any of the signal regions analyzed .",
    "the loudest event of the search occurred at 2009 january 22 05:48:43.2 utc and was the only event with a false - alarm rate below our predetermined follow - up threshold of @xmath44 = @xmath45hz as estimated via extrapolation from the 2000s local background region .",
    "this event can not be considered a gw candidate because it was found when only the hanford 2 km detector was observing and was coincident with a strong glitch caused by fluctuations in the ac power picked up by a magnetometer , and thus is highly likely to be an instrumental artifact .",
    "we estimate @xmath43 and @xmath42 for each signal region , which depend on detector sensitivities and antenna factors , the loudest signal region event , and the simulation waveform type . @xmath42",
