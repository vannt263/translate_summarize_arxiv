    "indeed , for the case of dense liquid metallic hydrogen , a superconducting phase has been predicted @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we investigate how a liquid superconductor would respond to applied magnetic fields .",
    "more precisely , we consider a meissner liquid , since we are interested in the magnetic response rather than the electric response .",
    "a candidate realization of a meissner fluid might be a suspension of superconducting particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a suspension of micron - sized superconducting cuprate particles in liquid nitrogen was investigated , and when those particles were coated with a layer of ice , acting as a surfactant preventing the particles from coagulating , a meissner liquid state was reported .",
    "the basic property of the meissner fluid is its capability to expell magnetic flux @xmath0 from its bulk by supporting a persistent surface electric current @xmath1 . in type ii  superconductors above the first critical field , the flux is incompletely expelled . here , we consider type i superconductors or type ii superconductors below the first critical field . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that when equilibrium is disrupted , @xmath0 and @xmath1 relax back to ( new ) equilibrium values with a characteristic time of @xmath2 s. the time scale for the hydrodynamic motion of a fluid surface ( as determined by the fluid s density and surface tension ) is much slower , and this allows to separate the dynamics of the currents and magnetic fields from that of the fluid surface .",
    "hence , for the different problems investigated in the present study , we assume that at each time the magnetic field has reached its equilibrium value for the given surface deformation of the fluid @xcite .",

    "iii , we investigate the higher - mode frequencies by neglecting curvature and modeling surface waves on a meissner liquid .",
    "we derive the modification of the wave dispersion by a magnetic field parallel with the surface .",
    "in the absence of gravity , a fixed volume of liquid will form a spherical droplet to minimize surface tension .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied on a droplet of meissner fluid , the fluid will magnetize in order to expell the magnetic flux .  the energy associated with this magnetization",
    "is expected to be smallest for a cigar - shaped droplet with the axis of cylindrical symmetry along the magnetic field . however , deforming the droplet into a prolate spheroid will also increase the surface tension energy .",
    "the optimal shape of the droplet can be found by balancing the magnetic and surface tension energies .    as possible shapes we will consider prolate spheroids with the major axis parallel to the applied magnetic field . the variational parameters determining the droplet shape are @xmath3 , the equatorial radius or semiminor axis , and @xmath4 , the semimajor axis .",

    "we investigate how the surface waves on an infinitely deep meissner fluid are influenced by an applied magnetic field parallel to the surface and parallel to the propagation direction of the wave ( a field normal to the propagation direction of the wave would be parallel to the wave fronts and would not induce magnetic charges on the surface - thus it would not alter the wave dispersion ) .",
