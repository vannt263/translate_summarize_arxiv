    "the energy of the primary particle , @xmath0 , is distributed among the shower components .",
    "the most of the energy deposit is due to ionization and excitation of the air molecules caused by electromagnetic component .",
    "the primary energy estimation algorithms are based mainly on the measurement of the shower parameters related to electromagnetic component energy , @xmath1 .",
    "such an approach is realized in high resolution fly s eye ( hires )  @xcite , pierre auger observatory ( pao )  @xcite and the yakutsk array  @xcite experiments .",
    "future applications are planned in the telescope array and satellite projects .    in all these experiments",

    ", unobservable with array detectors .",
    "this missing energy and conversion factor @xmath2 can be calculated modeling a cascade in atmosphere , as was done in  @xcite .",
    "however , only qgsjet and sibyll models have been applied in these simulations , setting aside the model dependence of the conversion factor .    in the present work the energies of air shower components",
    "are calculated using extremely different hadronic interaction models , but having the same maximum position and muon content of the resultant showers .",
    "it is shown that the model dependence of the ratio @xmath2 minimizes in this case .",
    "the variability of the ratio is estimated due to models and the primary nucleus mass .",
    "the experimental uncertainties in the electromagnetic component energy measurements are discussed . in particular , the energy spectra measured with the yakutsk and hires arrays are shown to be coincident within experimental errors .",
    "relativistic electrons of the shower induce vavilov - cherenkov radiation ( cherenkov light ) in the atmosphere .",
    "the total flux of light , @xmath3 , can be used as an estimator of the electromagnetic component energy in eas .",
    "this method realized in the yakutsk array experiment is based on the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 largely independent of the model  @xcite .",
    "the energy fraction dissipated in the ground is estimated using the tail of cascade curve measurement in inclined showers .",
    "another method , namely fluorescence technique , is applied in hires and pao / fd experiments where the fluorescence light emitted by wounded nitrogen molecules along the trajectory of the shower is collected by mirrors and received by photomultiplier pixels .",
    "the light intensity is proportional to the number of shower electrons , so the cascade curve , @xmath4 , is scanned by fired pixels and ionization in the atmosphere ( ionization integral ) can be estimated : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is slant depth along the shower axis in units of radiation length ( 36.7 g/@xmath7  @xcite ) ; @xmath8 is the thickness of atmosphere ; energies are in units of critical energy ( @xmath9 mev ) . as it was shown in cascade theory  @xcite ,",
    "the electromagnetic component energy is equal to ionization integral @xmath10 ; that is why the energy @xmath1 is actually evaluated in these experiments .",
    "measurements of the shower maximum position in the atmosphere as a function of the primary particle energy , @xmath11 , and the number of muons at observation level ( usually as a ratio to the number of electrons , @xmath12 ) are the basic parameters to be guided by performing the cascade simulations in the uhe region .",

    "experimental errors in @xmath13 measurement are @xmath15 to @xmath16 in the energy range @xmath17 ev ; @xmath12 ratio differs up to @xmath18 times between yakutsk and agasa data while the difference in @xmath19 itself is around 25%  @xcite .",
    "the main source of the discrepancy is the total number of charged particles on the ground which is estimated using the particle density measured at the shower periphery in both experiments .",
    "as was shown in previous calculation of the energy balance of eas components  @xcite , the dependence of primary energy deposited in the atmosphere on hadronic interaction models ( i.e. multiplicity of secondaries , cross sections , etc . ) can be parameterized via the longitudinal shower development characteristics @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is a consequence of the close connection between @xmath1 and the ionization integral . in this case",
    "( as far as other shower parameters are not concerned ) , we can go far beyond the bounds of conventional models .",
    "namely , we can use in very high energy region a variety of arbitrary extrapolations of accelerator data in order to apply hadronic interaction models with only restriction of the same resultant shower maximum and the muon content .",
    "it will allow to estimate the real limits of the ratio @xmath2 variations using distinctly different models in addition to standard models fitted to describe the same experimental data .    in this work",
    "three hadronic interaction models which are characterized by extremely different forms of the rapidity , @xmath20 , distribution of the sea secondaries in pionization region are used : i ) gauss model with normal rapidity distribution ; ii ) delta model with equal rapidities of @xmath21 secondaries and iii ) flat distribution model with @xmath22 .",
    "all other parameters of the models are flexible in order to get @xmath13 and @xmath12 of the shower fitting experimental data within errors . in the flat distribution model , for instance , the pionization region width and the fraction of secondary pions , kaons and nucleons in multiple production processes",
    "have been adjusted in addition to cross sections and fragmentation coefficients to get the output eas observables desired",
    ".    numerical solution of hadron transport equations is obtained using the resolvent of volterra equation on the rectangular lattice @xmath23  @xcite . to calculate the number of electrons in the shower at a depth @xmath6 , greisen s formula is employed .",
    "electromagnetic component energy is assumed to be equal to the energy of neutral pions , the decay of which into gamma - quanta initiates the component .",
    "the muon and neutrino energy is calculated via the energy fraction taken from the decay of charged pions and kaons .",
    "the hadronic component energy is summed up at each layer @xmath24 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath13 is strongly fluctuating parameter of the shower .",
    "monte carlo simulations using corsika code give rms deviation @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the proton and fe initiated showers of the same @xmath0 , correspondingly  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the primary energy fraction deposited in atmosphere is fluctuating much lesser because it is related to the integral along the shower trajectory .    in order to estimate the influence of cascade fluctuations on the ionization integral , a leading fragment approximation in the simplest case of the primary nucleon is used - only fluctuations in inelasticity and interaction points of the eas primary particle",
    "are considered , along suggestions given in  @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind the isotopic invariance of multiple production processes and multiplicity distribution , we derive the ionization integral event - by - event distribution , @xmath27 with fixed @xmath0 , as a ( @xmath28 - fold ) convolution of inelasticity fluctuations .",
    "resultant distribution is a gaussian with average energy fraction @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an elasticity in nucleon interactions ; @xmath31 is a projectile energy fraction carried out by neutral secondary pions .",
    "the rms deviation is @xmath32 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] .",
    "we neglect fluctuations in the rest of @xmath0 distributed among the shower components because of averaging over the huge number of shower particles .",
    "we are interested in the ionization integral and the energy deposited to muons+neutrinos in a shower .",
    "these values calculated for our models ( @xmath33 ev ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : balance ] . the hadronic component energy is less than @xmath34 at sea level .",
    "ionization in the atmosphere , @xmath35 , is closely related to the total air cherenkov light flux on the ground  @xcite and is measured with cherenkov light detectors of the yakutsk array . a point in fig .",
    "[ fig : balance ] is given with experimental error in the aggregate of calibration , atmospheric extinction of light uncertainty , etc .",
    "the energy of muons and neutrinos is estimated as a sum of @xmath36 measured on the ground and model calculation results giving the energy of neutrinos , ionization and decay of muons  @xcite .",
    "absolute experimental @xmath37 uncertainty ( @xmath38 ) is based on the difference between yakutsk and agasa @xmath19 measurements .",
    "another presentation of the results is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ege0 ] .",
    "electromagnetic component energy is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the energy of electrons and photons dissipated in the ground . to estimate it we need the total number of electrons at @xmath8 and its attenuation length : @xmath41 .",
    "the result based on the yakutsk array data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ege0 ] by circles .",
    "the yakutsk array data are used to estimate the energy of muonic component .",
    "energy remainder deposited to undetectable hadrons and neutrinos is estimated using the cascade modeling . in the hires case ,",
    "the energy fraction @xmath2 is exclusively the product of model simulations because the only component measured is the fluorescence light .",
    "since corsika / qgsjet code is used to estimate the conversion factor to primary energy , triangles represent qgsjet model results .",
    "eas simulation with sibyll model gives the ratio with difference less than @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the main feature of results given in figs .",
    "[ fig : balance],[fig : ege0 ] is that different models lead to approximate fractions of the primary energy assigned to electromagnetic component , if @xmath13 and @xmath12 are coincident .",
    "the model uncertainty is less than 3% in the interval @xmath17 ev where the experimental data are available ; the energy dependence of @xmath2 is limited to @xmath43 per decade , while a spread at @xmath44 ev is within @xmath45 .",
    "additionally , the ionization integral and @xmath37 are varying with the primary particle mass , in spite of the same @xmath13 for different nuclei .",
    "we estimated the variance to be less than @xmath46 if the primary mass is @xmath47 .",
    "the sum of two uncertainties ( from the model and primary mass ) is @xmath48 .",
    "we have not considered here showers initiated by other primaries , such as photons , neutrinos or mini black holes , because their muon content is a subject of the alternate investigation .    due to the negligible fraction of hadronic component energy at sea level , the remainder of @xmath0",
    "is transferred to muons and neutrinos . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath49 is nearly model independent , too , but the muon component energy measurable on the ground is more variable in different models .",
    "the experimental errors in the shower maximum detection and the number of muons at @xmath8 lead to the uncertainty of calculated ratio @xmath2 ( we will pass over @xmath50 considering it congruous ) . we have modeled this varying the multiplicity of secondaries and cross sections which result in the changes of @xmath13 and @xmath51 comparable to experimental uncertainties .",
    "resultant @xmath52 turned out to be below @xmath53 in the case of depth variation @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "so we have assumed the aggregate experimental uncertainty due to @xmath13 and @xmath19 measurement errors to be below @xmath46 .",
    "the greatest uncertainty source is the ionization integral measurement itself . for the yakutsk array data it comprises of errors due to cherenkov light measurement and the number of charged particles on the ground  @xcite : uncertainty in atmospheric transparency ( 15% ) ; detector calibration ( 21% ) and total light flux measurement ( 15% ) errors ; an uncertainty in the number of electrons reaches @xmath57 because the only measurable parameter is the particle density beyond hundred meters from the shower core .",
    "resultant @xmath2 estimation uncertainty ( @xmath58 ) is the sum of all these errors weighed with the shower component energies .",
    "the hires group claims a systematic uncertainty @xmath59  @xcite aggregated of errors in the absolute calibration of the photo - tubes ( @xmath60 ) , the yield of the fluorescence process ( @xmath60 ) , modeling of the atmosphere , and so on .    however , a comparison of model predictions with the hires / mia measurement of the average cascade curve in the interval @xmath61 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cascade ] ) reveals a discrepancy between calculated and measured curves .",
    "substantially , a contradiction in the cascade curve can be resolved using the attenuation length of electrons measured at sea level .",
    "equal intensity cuts method gives the value @xmath62 in the interval @xmath63 for the yakutsk array data  @xcite , while the hires curve has @xmath64 .",
    "models predict the length @xmath65 in agreement with the yakutsk array data",
    ".    there may be an additional uncertainty up to @xmath66 in @xmath1 assignment due to inadequate fitting of the longitudinal shower profile detected with hires",
    ". this may be the result of increased measurement error of the faint fluorescence light far from the shower maximum , and/or the direct and scattered cherenkov light contamination to the signal .",
    "there is an alternative @xmath1 estimation method proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the relation between the number of electrons at the shower maximum , @xmath67 , and energy of gamma - quanta initiating electromagnetic sub - cascade : @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the method is in avoidance of the cascade curve approximation ; disadvantage consists in the asymmetric distribution of @xmath67 . on the whole",
    ", it seems to be the more reliable approach to the estimation of electromagnetic component energy in comparison with integration of the longitudinal shower profile , not only at energies above @xmath69 ev , as was concluded in  @xcite .    presumably , the overall experimental uncertainty in ionization integral estimation is @xmath58 for the yakutsk array data , and @xmath70 for the hires measurements .",
    "consequently , notwithstanding nearly the same conversion factor from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , the primary energy estimate may be distinctly different in these experiments due to systematic errors in @xmath1 evaluation .    to provide an illustration ,",
    "the differential energy spectra measured with the yakutsk array  @xcite and hires  @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the primary energy is decreased by @xmath71 for the former data , and increased by @xmath72 for the latter .",
    "intensities are multiplied by @xmath73 in order to demonstrate the spectrum features - ankle around @xmath69 ev and steepening at @xmath74 ev ( greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin effect ) .",
    "the shape and intensity of the spectra derived from the data of the yakutsk array and hires are consistent indicating a need for systematic correction ( within experimental errors ) to the ionization integral measured .",
    "extremely different hadronic interaction models lead to the resultant ( electromagnetic component energy / eas primary particle energy ) ratio consistent within 7% if the model and primary mass guarantee the same maximum position in atmosphere and muon content of the shower : @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "the primary energy estimation algorithms based on ionization integral measurement rely on this ratio and the resultant uncertainty originates from experimental errors predominantly ; model dependent one is minor in the presence of contemporary measurements of the longitudinal shower development parameters .",
