    "the possibility of producing translationally ultracold molecules has recently generated great anticipation in the field of molecular dynamics .",
    "attractive applications include the possibility of testing fundamental symmetries @xcite , the potential of new phases of matter @xcite and the renewed quest for the control of chemical reactions through ultracold chemistry @xcite .",
    "these endeavors are beginning to bear scientific fruit .",
    "for example , high - resolution spectroscopic measurements of translationally cold samples of oh should allow improved astrophysical tests of the variation with time of the fine - structure constant @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental advances @xcite have made theoretical studies of the collisional behavior of cold molecules essential @xcite , both to interpret the data and to suggest future directions .",
    "several approaches have produced cold neutral molecules to date , many of which are described in ref .  .",
    "the methods available can be classified into _ direct methods",
    "_ , based on cooling of preexisting molecules , and _ indirect methods _ , which create ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms . among the direct methods , stark deceleration of dipolar molecules in a supersonic beam @xcite and helium buffer - gas cooling @xcite are currently leading the way .",
    "they reach temperatures of the order of 10  mk , and there are a wide variety of proposals on how to bridge the temperature gap to below 1  mk .",
    "these include evaporative cooling and even direct laser cooling .",
    "the idea of _ sympathetic cooling _ , where a hot species is cooled via collisions with a cold one , also seems very attractive and is being pursued by several experimental groups .",
    "sympathetic cooling is a form of _ collisional cooling _ , which works for multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously .",
    "it does not rely on specific transitions , which makes if suitable for cooling molecules .",
    "collisional cooling is also the basis for helium buffer - gas cooling .",
    "sympathetic cooling of trapped ions has already been demonstrated @xcite , using a different laser - cooled ionic species as the refrigerant .",
    "cooling of polyatomic molecules to sub - kelvin temperatures with ions has also been reported .",
    "this technique is expected to be suitable for cooling molecules of very high mass , including those of biological relevance @xcite .",
    "but the ease with which alkali metal atoms can be cooled to ultracold temperatures makes them good candidates to use as a thermal reservoir to cool other species .",
    "they have already been used to cool `` more difficult '' atomic alkali metal partners .",
    "for example , bec for @xmath5k was achieved by sympathetic cooling of potassium atoms with rb atoms @xcite .",
    "a theoretical study of the viability of this cooling technique for molecules is desirable .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical studies of collisions of molecules with he @xcite , in support of buffer - gas cooling , but only a few with alkali metals @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no such study has included the effects of hyperfine structure .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to study cold collisions of oh with trapped rb atoms .",
    "oh has been successfully slowed by stark deceleration in at least two laboratories @xcite .",
    "to cool the molecules further , sympathetic cooling by thermal contact with @xmath6rb is an attractive possibility .",
    "rb is easily cooled and trapped in copious quantities and can be considered the workhorse for experiments on cold atoms .",
    "temperatures below 100  @xmath7k are reached even in a mot environment ( 70  @xmath7k using normal laser cooling and 7  @xmath7k using techniques such as polarization gradient cooling ) .",
    "the cooling and lifetime of species in the trap depends largely on the ratio of elastic collision rates ( which lead to thermalization of the sample ) to inelastic ones .",
    "the latter can transfer molecules into non - trappable states and/or release kinetic energy , with resultant heating and trap loss .",
    "the characterization of the rates of both kinds of process is thus required .",
    "since applied electric and magnetic fields offer the possibility of _ controlling _ collisions , it is very important to know the effects of such fields on the rates . at present",
    ", nothing is known about the low - temperature collision cross sections of rb - oh or any similar system .",
    "rb - oh can be considered as a benchmark system for the study of the feasibility of sympathetic cooling for molecules .",
    "many molecule - alkali metal atom systems have deeply bound electronic states with ion - pair character @xcite and have collision rates that are enhanced by a `` harpooning '' mechanism",
    ". both the atom and the diatom are open - shell doublet species , and can interact on two triplet and three singlet potential energy surfaces ( pes ) . in addition , the oh radical has fine structure , including lambda - doubling , and both species possess nuclear spins and hence hyperfine structure .",
    "thus rb - oh is considerably more complicated than other collision systems that have been studied at low temperatures . in previous work",
    "we advanced the first estimates of cross sections ( for both inelastic and elastic collisions ) , based on fully _ ab initio _ surfaces , for the collision of oh radicals with rb atoms in the absence of external fields @xcite . here",
    "we provide details of the methodology used and discuss the potential surfaces and the state - resolved partial cross sections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the calculation of _ ab initio _",
    "pes for rb - oh . details of the electronic structure calculations are given and the methods used for diabatization , interpolation and fitting are described .",
    "the general features of the resulting surfaces are analyzed .",
    "section iii describes the exact and approximate theoretical methodologies used for the dynamical calculations .",
    "section iv presents the resulting cross sections and discusses the possibility of sympathetic cooling .",
    "we also comment on the role expected for the harpooning mechanism .",
    "section 5 summarizes our results and describes prospects for future work .",
    "further details about electronic structure calculations and other channels basis sets to describe the dynamics are given in appendixes 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "we have used _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations to obtain pes for interaction of oh(@xmath8 ) with rb .",
    "the ground @xmath9 state of oh has a @xmath10 configuration , while the ground @xmath11 state of rb has 5s@xmath12 . at long range , linear rboh thus has @xmath13 and @xmath14 states . at nonlinear configurations ,",
    "@xmath13 splits into @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with even and odd reflection symmetry in the molecular plane , whereas @xmath14 splits into @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    at shorter range ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the ion - pair threshold rb@xmath19 + oh@xmath20 lies only 2.35 ev above the neutral threshold .",
    "the corresponding @xmath21 ( @xmath15 ) ion - pair state drops very fast in energy with decreasing distance because of the coulomb attraction .",
    "below , jacobi coordinates ( @xmath22 ) will be used , @xmath23 being the radial distance between the atom and the oh center of mass and @xmath24 the angle between this line and the internuclear axis . at the linear rb - oh geometry , the ion - pair state crosses the covalent ( non - ion - pair ) state near @xmath25  , as shown in figure [ figcurve ] . at nonlinear geometries",
    ", the ion - pair state has the same symmetry ( @xmath15 ) as one of the covalent states , so there is an avoided crossing .",
    "there is thus a conical intersection between the two @xmath15 states at linear geometries , which may have major consequences for the scattering dynamics .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 8,-12)(0,0 ) * * ( 8,-28.7)(0,0 ) * * ( 8,-45.5)(0,0 ) * *    the @xmath15 electronic wavefunctions near the conical intersection are made up from two quite different configurations , so that a multiconfiguration electronic structure approach is essential to describe them .",
    "we have therefore chosen to use mcscf ( multiconfiguration self - consistent field ) calculations followed by mrci ( multireference configuration interaction ) calculations to characterize the surfaces .",
    "the electronic structure calculations initially produce _ adiabatic _ ( born - oppenheimer ) surfaces , but these are unsuitable for dynamics calculations both because they are difficult to interpolate ( with derivative discontinuities at the conical intersections ) and because there are nonadiabatic couplings between them that become infinite at the conical intersections .",
    "we have therefore transformed the two @xmath15 adiabatic surfaces that cross into a _ diabatic _",
    "representation , where there are non - zero couplings between different surfaces but both the potentials and the couplings are smooth functions of coordinates .",
    "the electronic structure calculations are carried out using the molpro package @xcite .",
    "it was necessary to carry out an rhf ( restricted hartree - fock ) calculation to provide initial orbital guesses before an mcscf calculation .",
    "it is important that the hartree - fock calculation gives good orbitals for both the oh @xmath26 and rb 5s orbitals at all geometries ( even those inside the crossing , where the rb 5s orbital is unoccupied in the ground state ) .",
    "in addition , it is important that the oh @xmath26 orbitals are doubly occupied in the rhf calculations , as otherwise they are non - degenerate at linear geometries at the rhf level , and the mcscf calculation is unable to recover the degeneracy . to ensure this , we begin with an rhf calculation on rboh@xmath20 rather than neutral rboh .    for rb , we use the small - core quasirelativistic effective core potential ( ecp ) ecp28mwb @xcite with the valence basis set from ref .",
    "this treats the 4s , 4p and 5s electrons explicitly , but uses a pseudopotential to represent the core orbitals . for o and h",
    ", we use the aug - cc - pvtz correlation - consistent basis sets of dunning @xcite in uncontracted form .",
    "electronic structure calculations were carried out at 275 geometries , constructed from all combinations of 25 intermolecular distances @xmath23 and 11 angles @xmath24 in jacobi coordinates .",
    "the 25 distances were from 2.0 to 6.0  in steps of 0.25 , from 6.0 to 9.0  in steps of 0.5  and from 9  to 12  in steps of 1 .",
    "the oh bond length was fixed at @xmath27 .",
    "the 11 angles were chosen to be gauss - lobatto quadrature points @xcite , which give optimum quadratures to project out the legendre components of the potential while retaining points at the two linear geometries .",
    "the linear points are essential to ensure that the @xmath28 and @xmath29 surfaces are properly degenerate at linear geometries : if we used gauss - legendre points instead , the values of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 potentials at linear geometries would depend on extrapolation from nonlinear points and would be non - degenerate .",
    "the gauss - lobatto points correspond approximately to @xmath30 , 20.9 , 38.3 , 55.6 , 72.8 , 90 , 107.2 , 124.4 , 141.7 , 159.1 and 180@xmath31 , where @xmath30 is to the linear rb - ho geometry .",
    "the calculations were in general carried out as angular scans at each distance , since this avoided most convergence problems due to sudden changes in orbitals between geometries .",
    "we carried out a state - averaged mcscf calculation of the lowest 3 singlet states of neutral rboh ( two @xmath15 and one @xmath16 ) .",
    "molecular orbital basis sets will be described using the notation @xmath32 , where the two integers indicate the number of @xmath28 and @xmath29 orbitals included .",
    "the orbital energies are shown schematically in figure [ figorb ] .",
    "the mcscf basis set includes a complete active space ( cas ) constructed from the lowest ( 10,3 ) molecular orbitals , with the lowest ( 5,1 ) orbitals closed ( doubly occupied in all configurations ) .",
    "the mcscf calculation generates a common set of orbitals for the 3 states .",
    "the calculations were carried out in @xmath33 symmetry , but at linear geometries the two components of the @xmath34 states are degenerate to within our precision ( @xmath35 ) .    for cold molecule collisions , it is very important to have a good representation of the long - range forces .",
    "these include a large contribution from dispersion ( intermolecular correlation ) , so require a correlated treatment .",
    "we therefore use the mcscf orbitals in an mrci calculation , again of the lowest three electronic states .",
    "the molpro package implements the  internally contracted \" mrci algorithm of werner and knowles @xcite .",
    "the reference space in the mrci is the same as the active space for the mcscf , and single and double excitations are included from all orbitals except oxygen 1s .",
    "as described in appendix 1 , the two @xmath15 states are calculated in a single mrci block , so that they share a common basis set .",
    "we encountered difficulties with non - degeneracy between the two components of the @xmath13 states at linear geometries .",
    "these are described in appendix 1 . however , using the basis sets and procedures described here , the non - degeneracies were never greater than 90 @xmath36 in the total energies for distances @xmath37   ( and considerably less in the interaction energies around the linear minimum ) .",
    "as described above , the two surfaces of @xmath15 symmetry cross at conical intersections at linear geometries . for dynamical calculations , it is highly desirable to transform the adiabatic states into diabatic states ( or , strictly , quasidiabatic states ) .",
    "molpro contains code to carry out diabatization by maximizing overlap between the diabatic states and those at a reference geometry .",
    "however , this did not work for our application because we were unable to find reference states that had enough overlap with the lowest adiabats at all geometries .",
    "we therefore adopted a different approach , based on matrix elements of angular momentum operators .",
    "we use a cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath38 axis along the oh bond . at any linear geometry",
    ", the @xmath34 component of @xmath15 symmetry is uncontaminated by the ion - pair state , and the matrix elements of @xmath39 are @xmath40 at nonlinear geometries , the actual @xmath15 states can be represented approximately as a mixture of @xmath41 and @xmath34 components , @xmath42 where the  singlet \" superscripts have been dropped to simplify notation .",
    "[ mix ] were exact , the matrix elements of @xmath39 would be @xmath43 the mixing angle @xmath44 would thus be given by @xmath45 in the present work , we have taken the mixing angle to be _ defined _ by eq",
    ".  [ ratio ] , using matrix elements of @xmath39 calculated between the mrci wavefunctions .",
    "this gives a mixing angle that , for linear geometries , is @xmath46 at long range and @xmath47 at short range ( inside the crossing ) .",
    "one complication that arises here is that the signs of the three wavefunctions are arbitrary , and may change discontinuously from one geometry to another .",
    "the signs of the matrix elements obtained numerically by molpro are thus completely arbitrary .",
    "it was therefore necessary to pick a sign convention for the matrix elements at linear geometries and adjust the signs at other geometries to give a smoothly varying mixing angle .",
    "it should be noted that this diabatization procedure is not general , and will fail if there is any geometry where both the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "[ ratio ] are small .",
    "fortunately , this was not encountered for rboh .",
    "the sum of squares of the two matrix elements of @xmath39 was never less than 0.99 at distances from @xmath48   outwards , and never less than 0.7 even at @xmath49  .",
    "the mixing angles obtained for the singlet states of rboh are shown as a contour plot in figure [ figmix ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath44 changes very suddenly from 0 to @xmath50 at linear and near - linear geometries , but smoothly at strongly bent geometries .",
    "once a smooth mixing angle has been determined , the diabatic potentials and coupling surface are obtained from @xmath51    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 7.5,-3.5)(0,0 ) * * ( 7.5,-25)(0,0 ) * *    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 7.5,-3.5)(0,0 ) * * ( 7.5,-25)(0,0 ) * *    the diabatization was carried out using total electronic energies ( not interaction energies ) .",
    "the two singlet diabatic pes that correlate with rb(@xmath11 ) + oh(@xmath8 ) are shown in figure [ figsing1 ] , and the diabatic ion - pair surface and the coupling potential are shown in figure [ figsing2 ] . some salient characteristics of the surfaces",

    "we consider first the collision of atoms and molecules that are both in their maximally stretched states , @xmath54 .",
    "the s - wave incident channel has @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "the set of all @xmath57 channels with a defined total parity @xmath58 , including all allowed @xmath59 projections , as well as all the @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 quantum numbers ( or equivalently @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) contains 23433 channels .",
    "this makes an exact calculation infeasible .",
    "we have therefore introduced two approximations to reduce this number .",
    "first , the projection @xmath63 for channels with @xmath68 is fixed to its initial value ; the suppressed projections increase the degeneracy and might split rotational feshbach resonances , but numerical tests show that making this approximation does not substantially alter the overall magnitude of the cross sections reported here .",
    "this approximation reduces the number of channels to 10555 .",
    "second , for propagation at large @xmath23 we disregard channels that are `` locally closed '' , that is , whose centrifugal barrier is higher than the incident energy in a given amount that is modified until converence .    even with these approximations , and the suppression of ion - pair channels",
    ", it is impractical to perform full calculations .",
    "however , dividing the radial solution of the schrdinger equation into an inner region ( @xmath69 ) and an outer region ( @xmath70 ) makes it possible to use different basis sets ( `` frames '' ) in each of them .",
    "frame transformations have previously been employed for the simpler problem of alkaline earth+alkaline earth collisions @xcite and for electron - molecule collisions @xcite .",
    "they will be an essential tool for introducing hyperfine structure into atom - molecule and molecule - molecule collision problems @xcite .",
    "the calculation is thus divided into two different steps :    * at short range , @xmath71 , the hyperfine interaction is small compared to the depths of the short - range potentials .",
    "we therefore represent the hamiltonian in basis set b3 ( see appendix 2 ) , where the potential is diagonal in nuclear spin projections @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "there are 8 such blocks ( since @xmath74 ) .",
    "we ignore elements of @xmath75 that couple different pairs of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this reduces a single @xmath76 calculation to 8 @xmath77 calculations . at @xmath78",
    "the complete @xmath79 matrix can be rebuilt using the partial @xmath80 matrices obtained from each subset , @xmath81 + @xmath82 + this @xmath79 matrix is then transformed into the asymptotic basis set b1 .",
    "we have found that this frame transform provides a very accurate way to include the rb - oh hyperfine structure in reduced calculations using only covalent channels .",
    "moreover , owing to the depth of the short - range potentials , @xmath79 is weakly dependent on energy and can be interpolated in the inner region .",
    "* at long range , @xmath83 , the @xmath79 matrix , expressed already in b1 , is propagated to large distances to obtain the @xmath84 matrix .",
    "we invoke an alternative approximation : the coupling between different asymptotic rotational and fine - structure states diminishes at longer distances and can be neglected .",
    "thus the subset corresponding to the ground rotational diatomic state ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) can be propagated by itself to asymptotic distances .",
    "we reinstate the full hyperfine hamiltonian in this region .",
    "it is worth noting that basis set b2 , defined in appendix 2 , could also be the basis for another frame transformation .",
    "approximate decoupling of singlet and triplet channels in the inner region would allow a partition of the numerical effort into two smaller groups of channels , and the introduction of the ionic channels in the singlet one .",
    "we have calculated elastic and state - resolved inelastic cross sections for two different incident channels for collisions of rb atoms with oh molecules .",
    "these are shown as c1 and c2 in figure [ levelsh ] .",
    "although we do not include the effects of external fields explicitly in this work , we consider states in which both partners can be in weak - field - seeking states in a magnetic field , and thus magnetically trappable .",
    "the oh hyperfine states that can be trapped at laboratory magnetic fields are @xmath87 and @xmath88 , while the corresponding states for rb are @xmath89 ; the rb state @xmath90 is trappable for fields smaller that @xmath91 gauss .    in the first case , designated c1 in figure [ levelsh ] ,",
    "both partners are in maximally stretched states : oh@xmath92 + rb@xmath93 .",
    "this case corresponds to the highest threshold correlating with oh in its ground rotational state . in this case , oh is also electrostatically trappable .",
    "the second case , designated c2 in figure [ levelsh ] , correlates with the lowest asymptotic threshold in the absence of an external field : oh@xmath94 + rb@xmath95 .",
    "both partners are again magnetically trappable , although in a field they will no longer be the lowest energy states .",
    "figure [ adiab ] shows selected adiabatic curves correlating with the lower rotational states for the collision with both partners in maximally stretched states ( @xmath96 ) . in our calculations",
    "we take @xmath97 .",
    "as described above , for @xmath98 the hyperfine interaction is partially neglected . for @xmath99 , only hyperfine channels with oh in its ground rotational state are included .",
    "we begin by showing in figure [ crosses0 ] the total cross sections for incident channels c1 and c2 . a brief description of",
    "these has been reported previously @xcite .",
    "below @xmath100  k for incident channel c1 , or @xmath101  k for c2 , the wigner threshold law applies .",
    "namely , as the energy goes to zero , cross sections corresponding to elastic and isoenergetic processes approach a constant value , while those for exoergic processes vary as @xmath102 , rapidly exceeding elastic cross sections .",
    "no quantitative predictive power is expected in this region .",
    "rather , the values of threshold cross sections are strongly subject to details of the pes , and are typically only uncovered by experiments .    at higher energies , above @xmath103  k , where many partial waves contribute ( @xmath104 for c1 and @xmath105 for c2 ) , the behavior of the cross sections changes and inelastic processes are well described by a semiclassical langevin capture model @xcite , @xmath106 this cross section is also plotted in figure [ crosses0 ] ( points ) .",
    "the langevin expression arises as a limit of the exact quantum expression in eq .",
    "[ nondiag ] , with the usual assumptions : the impact parameter takes values in a continuous range , and the height of the centrifugal barrier , determined using only long - range behavior , determines the number of partial waves that contribute for a given energy .",
    "similar behavior has been observed previously in cold collisions , such as @xmath107 with @xmath108 an alkali metal .",
    "for li + li@xmath109 , @xmath110 was found to be a sufficient for the cross sections to exhibit langevin behavior @xcite .    as can be seen in figure [ crosses0 ]",
    ", the langevin limit reproduces the general trend across the entire semiclassical energy range . in a hund s case ( a ) system like oh , where the electron spin is strongly tied to the intermolecular axis",
    ", the highly anisotropic pes might be expected to disrupt the spin orientation relative to the laboratory frame completely . as a consequence",
    ", inelastic processes are expected to be very likely and the langevin model should describe well the behavior of rb - oh and similar systems .",
    "a similar upper limit for the elastic cross section is given by four times the inelastic one .",
    "it is easy to verify that , if the inelastic cross section reaches its maximum value , the elastic and inelastic contributions to the cross section must be equal .",
    "this behavior is also seen in figure [ crosses0 ] .",
    "the cross sections for incident channel c2 are quite different from those for incident channel c1 . for c2 ,",
    "the cross sections are highly structured , exhibiting a large number of feshbach resonances .",
    "since the atom and the diatom are both in their lowest - energy state , there are plenty of higher - lying hyperfine states to resonate with . however , the pronounced minimum in the elastic cross section at @xmath111  k is the consequence of a near - zero s - wave phase shift .",
    "( -8,15.0)(14,0 )    ( 5 , 9 ) ( 5 , 17 )      some additional insight into the collision process can be obtained by examining the partial cross sections to various final states . however , there are many of these . starting in incident channel c1 , there are 128 possible outcomes , counting the hyperfine states of both rb and oh , plus the lambda doublet of oh . to simplify this information , we first break the cross sections into four classes : elastic scattering , scattering in which only the rb state changes , scattering in which only the oh state changes , and scattering in which both change .    these four possibilities are shown in figure [ crosses2 ] for both incident channels , c1 and c2 .",
    "in general , all four processes are likely to occur .",
    "this further attests to the complete disruption of the spin during a collision . nevertheless , at the highest energies probed ( where results are less sensitive to potential details ) there is a definite propensity for the oh molecule to change its internal state more readily than the rb atom , at least when only one of them changes .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the spherical symmetry of the rb atom , whereby its electronic spin is indifferent to its orientation .",
    "by contrast , the electronic angular momentum of oh is strongly coupled to the molecular axis , and will follow its changes in orientation due to the anisotropies in the interaction .",
    "( -8,15.0)(14,0 )    ( 5 , 9 ) ( 5 , 17 )    a more detailed understanding can be obtained by considering eq.[elements ] . for rb the hyperfine projection is given by @xmath112 , whereas for oh it is given by @xmath113 .",
    "the nuclear spin projections @xmath66 and @xmath67 are untouched by potential energy couplings .",
    "the potential conserves @xmath114 , so that if the rb electronic spin @xmath65 changes , so will the oh electronic spin @xmath115 . on the other hand ,",
    "oh can also change the projection @xmath116 of the rotational angular momentum @xmath117 , which is absent in rb .",
    "thus oh has more opportunities to change its internal state than does rb , and this is reflected in the propensities in figure [ crosses2 ] .",
    "we first consider incident channel c1 , with both collision partners initially in their maximally stretched states .",
    "some of the main outcomes are shown in fig [ crosses ] . in the absence of an anisotropic interaction , and remembering that @xmath118 is conserved , the sum of the spin projections @xmath119 would be conserved .",
    "thus inelastic collisions would be impossible .",
    "this is because the projection of @xmath63 could not be lowered without raising @xmath62 , but @xmath62 could not be raised further .",
    "however , the anisotropic pes in rb - oh allows such changes quite readily",
    ".    there remains , however , a propensity for collisions with small values of @xmath120 to be more likely , as seen in figure [ ohbaja ] . part ( a ) shows cross sections that change @xmath63 for oh without changing @xmath62 for rb , while part ( b ) shows those that change @xmath62 without changing @xmath63 . as noted above , rb appears to be more reluctant to change its projection .",
    "in fact , since the potential is diagonal in the states of the nuclei , only consecutive values of @xmath62 are coupled in first order . on the other hand",
    ", first - order coupling exists between many different values of @xmath63 .",
    "finally , a decrease in the probability of processes with increasing @xmath121 can be related to the diminution of anisotropic terms in the potential when increasing the angular momentum transfer ( @xmath122 in eq .  [ elements ] ) .",
    "( -8,17.0)(14,0 )    ( 5 , 9 ) ( 5 , 17 )    we now consider incident channel c2 , oh@xmath123 + rb@xmath90 .",
    "this is the lowest threshold in the absence of a field .",
    "only three channels , degenerate with the initial channel , are possible outcomes at very low energies : @xmath124 @xmath125 .",
    "since these states have the same value of @xmath126 as the initial channel , the processes can occur by ordinary spin exchange with no centrifugal barrier .",
    "partial cross sections for these three channels are shown in figure [ crosses3 ] ( a ) over the entire energy range .",
    "intriguingly , inelastic ( state - changing ) collisions seem to be somewhat suppressed relative to elastic scattering .",
    "suppressed spin - exchange rates would presumably require delicate cancellation between singlet and triplet phase shifts @xcite .",
    "that such a cancellation occurs in a highly multichannel process is somewhat unexpected .",
    "however , examining the matrix elements of the potential reveals that there is no direct coupling between the initial state @xmath124 and final state @xmath127 .",
    "transitions via potential couplings are therefore a second - order process requiring the mediation of other channels .",
    "many other exit channels are possible , once energy and angular momentum considerations permit them .",
    "cross sections for several such processes are shown in figure [ crosses3 ] ( b ) .",
    "for example , the channels oh@xmath128 + rb@xmath129 and oh@xmath128 + rb@xmath130 are not connected to the initial channel by spin exchange , since @xmath131 changes by @xmath132 . in this case , angular momentum shunts from the molecule into the partial - wave degree of freedom , necessitating an @xmath133 partial wave in the exit channel .",
    "therefore , this process is suppressed for energies below the @xmath58-wave centrifugal barrier , whose height is 1.6 mk .",
    "( -8,17.0)(14,0 )    ( 5 , 9 ) ( 5 , 17 )    we conclude this subsection by stressing the vital importance of including the hyperfine structure in these calculations .",
    "figure [ pairs ] shows partial cross sections for incident channel c1 scattering into pairs of channels which differ only in the small hyperfine splitting of oh ( @xmath134  mk ) . in one example ( black and red solid curves ) , the parity of oh changes from @xmath135 to @xmath136 , leading to the final channels oh@xmath137 + rb@xmath138 .",
    "these channels , distinguished only by their hyperfine quantum number @xmath61 , are almost identical at high energies , but quite different at low energies . as a second example , consider the final channels oh@xmath139 + rb@xmath140 , ( green and orange dashed ) , which preserve the initial parity .",
    "the process with @xmath141 is exothermic , while the one with @xmath142 requires the opening of the partial wave threshold .",
    "only after both channels are open , at higher energies , do the cross sections become almost identical .",
    "we have not yet fully incorporated the ion - pair channel in our calculations , but it is instructive to assess its influence .",
    "in the harpooning model it is usually understood that , if the electron transfer takes place at long range , large collision cross sections result @xcite . however , for rb - oh the crossing point @xmath143    gives a geometric cross section of only @xmath144 @xmath4 .",
    "this is substantially smaller than the quantum - mechanical cross sections we have estimated .",
    "thus while harpooning may enhance cross sections substantially at thermal energies , it is likely to have less overall influence in cold collisions .",
    "the inelastic results above place cross sections near the semiclassical langevin upper limit .",
    "the harpooning mechanism is unlikely to increase their magnitude , but could change their details .",
    "for example , it might be expected that the harpooning mechanism would distribute the total probability more evenly among the different spin orientations .",
    "we have explored the influence of the harpooning mechanism in a reduced calculation where the hyperfine structure is neglected .",
    "this makes the calculation tractable even with the ion - pair channel included .",
    "the resulting elastic and total inelastic cross sections , for incident channel oh@xmath145 + rb@xmath146 ( maximally stretched in the absence of nuclear degrees of freedom ) are shown in figure [ ionico ] .",
    "they are compared to the results obtained without the ion - pair channels . in the semiclassical region , @xmath147  mk , the general order of magnitude of the cross sections",
    "is preserved , although the detailed features are not . in the wigner regime , by contrast , including the ion - pair channel makes a quite significant change , because completely different phase shifts are generated in low - lying partial waves .",
    "we stress again , however , that we do not expect this or any model to have predictive power for the values of low - energy cross sections until the ambiguities in absolute scattering lengths are resolved by experiments .",
    "based on the results above , we can draw several general conclusions concerning both the feasibility of observing rb - oh collisions experimentally in a beam experiment and the possibility of sympathetic cooling of oh using ultracold rb .",
    "we can assert with some confidence that rb - oh cross sections at energies of tens of mk , typical of stark decelerators , will be on the order of @xmath148 .",
    "this is probably large enough to make the collisions observable . in round numbers ,",
    "consider a rb mot with density @xmath149 @xmath150 , and an oh packet emerging from a stark decelerator at 10 m / s , with density @xmath151 @xmath150 .",
    "further assume that the rb is stored in an elongated mot that allows an interaction distance of 1 cm as the oh passes through .",
    "in this case , a cross section @xmath152 @xmath4 implies that approximately @xmath153 of the oh molecules are scattered out of the packet .",
    "this quantity , while small , should be observable in repeated shots of the experiment @xcite .    as for sympathetic cooling oh using cold rb",
    ", it seems unlikely that this will be possible for species in their stretched states as in channel c1 .",
    "the inelastic rates are almost always comparable to , or greater than , the elastic rates .",
    "the situation becomes even worse as the temperature drops and cross sections for exoergic processes diverge .",
    "every collision event _ might _ serve to thermalize the oh gas , but is equally likely to remove the molecule from the trap altogether , or contribute to heating the gas .    for collision partners in the low - energy states of incident channel c2 ,",
    "the situation is not as bleak , at least in the low - energy limit , since inelastic cross sections do not diverge and may be fairly small .",
    "however , we have focused on the weak - magnetic - field seeking state of oh , which will not be the lowest - energy state in a magnetic field .",
    "thus exoergic processes again appear , and inelastic rates will again become unacceptably large . under these circumstances , rather than `` sympathetic cooling , '' the gas would exhibit `` simply pathetic cooling . ''    from these considerations , it seems that the only way to guarantee inelastic rates sufficiently low to afford sympathetic cooling would be to remove all exoergic inelastic channels altogether .",
    "thus both species , atom and molecule , should be trapped in their absolute ground states , using optical or microwave dipole traps @xcite or possibly an alternating current trap @xcite .",
    "sympathetic cooling would then be forced due to the absence of any possible outcome other than elastic and endoergic processes .",
    "the latter might produce a certain population of hyperfine - excited oh molecules , which could then give up their internal energy again and contribute towards heating .",
    "however , the molecules are far more likely to collide with atoms than with other molecules , so that this energy would eventually be carried away as the rb is cooled .    further aspects of the rb - oh collision problem need further work .",
    "foremost among these is the possibility that inelastic rates could be reduced or controlled by applying electric and/or magnetic fields .",
    "this may result partly from the simple act of moving feshbach resonances to different energies , or from altering the effective coupling between incident and final channels , as has been hinted at previously @xcite .",
    "in addition , the influence of the ion - pair channel may be significant .",
    "there is the possibility , for example , that the highly polar rboh molecule might be produced by absorption followed by either spontaneous or stimulated emission @xcite .",
    "finally , new phenomena are possible , such as analogues of the field - linked states that have been predicted in dipole - dipole collisions @xcite .",
    "as described above , we encountered difficulties with non - degeneracies between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 components of the @xmath13 state at linear geometries .",
    "these could have been avoided by carrying out the linear calculations in @xmath154 rather than @xmath33 symmetry , but @xmath33 symmetry was essential to avoid discontinuities at @xmath30 and @xmath155 .      1 .",
    "the molecular orbital basis set is partitioned into internal and external sets , and the internal orbitals are in turn partitioned into closed and active sets .",
    "a reference space is generated , including all possible arrangements of the @xmath156 available electrons among the active orbitals that give states of the specified symmetry and spin multiplicity .",
    "the closed orbitals are doubly occupied in all reference configurations .",
    "a set of @xmath1572)-electron states is generated by all possible 2-electron annihilations from the reference states ( with no symmetry constraints ) .",
    "some of the closed orbitals may be designated as core orbitals , in which case annihilations from them are not included .",
    "a set of @xmath1571)-electron states is generated by all possible 1-electron additions to internal orbitals of the @xmath1572)-electron states ( with no symmetry constraints ) .",
    "the final ci basis includes states of 3 different classes : * _ internal _ states are generated by all possible 1-electron additions to the @xmath1571)-electron states , with the extra electron in an internal orbital , that give states of the specified symmetry and spin multiplicity ; * _ singly external _ states are generated by all possible 1-electron additions to the @xmath1571)-electron states , with the extra electron in an external orbital , that give states of the specified symmetry and spin multiplicity ; * internally contracted _ doubly external _ states are generated by 2-electron excitations into the external space from a reference function obtained by solving a small ci problem in the reference space .",
    "first , there is a part of the non - degeneracy due to the internal and singly external configurations . at linear geometries",
    "there are both @xmath41-type and @xmath34-type reference configurations .",
    "both types are included for @xmath28 symmetry , but only the @xmath34-type reference configurations are included for @xmath29 symmetry . in the @xmath28 calculation , therefore , there are additional @xmath34-type internal and singly external configurations that arise from @xmath41-type reference configurations .",
    "this effect could in principle be suppressed in molpro by including reference configurations of both symmetries in both calculations at all geometries , but this was prohibitively expensive in computer time .",
    "in addition , as described below , it is responsible for only about 20% of the total non - degeneracy .",
    "secondly , there is a part of the non - degeneracy due to the ( contracted ) doubly external configurations .",
    "it must be remembered that we wish to transform the @xmath158 and @xmath159 singlet states into a diabatic representation . to do this meaningfully",
    ", we need them to be calculated using identical basis sets .",
    "if we do the mrci calculations separately , this is not true : even if the reference space is the same , each state produces a _ different _ set of internally contracted doubly external states .",
    "it is thus necessary to calculate the two @xmath15 states in the _ same _ mrci block , so that the basis set contains both sets of contracted functions .",
    "however , this results in a larger and more flexible basis set of contracted doubly external functions than is generated in the @xmath16 case .      *",
    "if calculations are carried out in @xmath154 symmetry , the ion - pair and covalent states have different symmetry and the non - degeneracy is not present ; * for @xmath33 symmetry with the two @xmath15 states calculated in a single mrci block , both sources of non - degeneracy are present and the non - degeneracy is @xmath161 ; * for @xmath33 symmetry with the two @xmath15 states calculated in separate mrci blocks , only the first source of non - degeneracy is present and the non - degeneracy is @xmath162 ; * for @xmath33 symmetry with the two @xmath15 states calculated in a single mrci block , but reference configurations of both symmetries included , only the second source of non - degeneracy is present and the non - degeneracy is @xmath163 ; * for @xmath33 symmetry with the two @xmath15 states calculated in separate mrci blocks , with reference configurations of both symmetries included , there is no non - degeneracy .",
    "basis set b2 is based on hund s case ( b ) quantum numbers for the molecule : the orbital angular momentum of the electron and the rotational angular momentum couple to form @xmath117 , with @xmath164 projection on the internuclear axis .",
    "@xmath117 coupled to the spin of the electron @xmath165 would give us @xmath166 for the diatomic fragment , as in basis set b1 .",
    "instead , in b2 we couple @xmath165 with @xmath167 to obtain the total spin of the electrons , described by kets @xmath168 .",

    "is then given by @xmath171 represents @xmath172 .",
