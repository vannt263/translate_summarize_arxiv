    "the present agreement between experimental data and the standard model ( sm ) suggests that the energy scale @xmath6 associated with any new physics should be large compared with the electroweak scale @xmath7 gev . to infer the existence of new particles as heavy as @xmath6 through their virtual effects , effective lagrangian ( el ) techniques",
    "have been extensively used to study quantities which are forbidden or highly suppressed within the sm @xcite . among these quantities ,",
    "self - couplings of electroweak gauge bosons constitute a sensitive probe of nonstandard interactions @xcite .",
    "experimental bounds on possible anomalous @xmath8 couplings have reached an accuracy of the few percent level in both hadronic and leptonic colliders @xcite , but the situation looks less promising for anomalous @xmath9 , and @xmath10 couplings @xcite rather than @xmath11 . ] . unlike @xmath8 couplings ,",
    "trilinear neutral gauge boson couplings ( tngbc ) vanish when the three bosons are real .",
    "another interesting peculiarity of tngbc is that they must be induced by loop effects in any renormalizable theory since they can not possess a renormalizable structure . in the sm ,",
    "tngbc are generated at one - loop level by fermion triangles @xcite , being very suppressed even in the presence of a fourth fermion family @xcite .",
    "there follows that it is convenient to carry out a model independent study of tngbc using the el method to parametrize any anomalous contribution . within this approach , there are two well motivated schemes to parametrize virtual effects of physics beyond the fermi scale via effective operators involving only sm fields , namely the linear and the nonlinear realizations .    in the linear realization or decoupling scenario",
    "it is assumed that the light spectrum of particles , which fill out multiplets of the electroweak @xmath12 gauge group , includes at least the physical higgs boson of the sm .",
    "because of the decoupling theorem , virtual effects of heavy physics can not affect low energy processes dramatically .",
    "nonetheless , any new effect , in spite of its smallness , may have significant effects on the couplings which are absent or highly suppressed within the sm .",
    "starting from the sm fields and assuming lepton and baryon number conservation , there is no way to construct any odd dimension operator respecting the linearly realized @xmath13 symmetry . as for dimension six ,",
    "operators of this class were comprehensively studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that there are 84 independent dimension six operators .    in the case of the nonlinear realization or nondecoupling scenario ,",
    "the parametrization of new physics effects arises when it is assumed that the higgs bosons are very heavy or do not exist at all .",
    "the scalar sector is comprised only by goldstone bosons , which transform nonlinearly under the @xmath12 group .",
    "it is also possible to introduce light scalar fields in this parametrization , but they can not be recognized as higgs bosons since such fields do not couple to the remaining light particles as dictated by the higgs mechanics @xcite . since the low energy theory is nonrenormalizable under dyson prescription , heavy physics does not decouple from the low energy processes .",
    "we may think of this scenario as the one in which the el parametrizes unknown physics which would not obey the higgs mechanism . in this case ,",
    "the most important operators are the ones which induce the masses of the @xmath14 and @xmath4 gauge bosons , prescribing also the general structure of the @xmath8 couplings @xcite .",
    "these operators have dimension two and four .    at the lowest order",
    ", anomalous @xmath8 couplings are induced by dimension six operators in the decoupling scenario . in the nonlinear scheme ,",
    "they receive contributions from dimension four operators . in contrast , at the lowest order , tngbc are induced by dimension eight operators in the linear realization and by dimension six operators in the nonlinear one . in the latter case",
    "there are also some dimension four operators which give rise to the @xmath15 coupling , but they are proportional to the scalar part of the @xmath4 boson ( @xmath16 ) . it can be shown that such operators may be eliminated by means of a transformation which leaves invariant the @xmath17-matrix @xcite .",
    "consequently , any anomalous contribution to tngbc is expected to be more supppresed than those inducing nonstandard @xmath8 couplings .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that any potential effect must be carefully examined as it may constitute a clear evidence of new physics .",
    "the structure of tngbc has already been studied in the context of effective theories , initially at the level of vertex functions @xcite . however , in this approach it was considered the case where two particles are real and just one is virtual .",
    "it is only very recently that the analysis of the off - sell vertices has been done under the @xmath18 gauge invariant framework , including the study of the respective el . by invoking bose symmetry , lorentz covariance , and electromagnetic gauge invariance ,",
    "the most general structures inducing tngbc with three off - shell neutral bosons were constructed @xcite . as was shown in @xcite , the @xmath18",
    "gauge invariant framework is equivalent to the nonlinearly realized @xmath13 invariant case .",
    "such an equivalence is explicit in the unitary gauge .",
    "the choice of using either framework is only a matter of convenience . in particular ,",
    "the nonlinear scheme is convenient in working out loop calculations , as the presence of goldstone bosons allows to quantize the theory with the aid of a renormalizable @xmath19 gauge .",
    "it is clear that a comprehensive study of tngbc must include both the linear and the nonlinear schemes . to our knowledge",
    "the former has never been studied before .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to present a complete list of the effective operators which induce tngbc at the lowest order in both realizations of the @xmath12 gauge symmetry .",
    "not all the operators that can be constructed respecting the lorentz and electroweak symmetries are independent since a certain class of general transformations allows to rule out some of them without affecting the @xmath17-matrix elements @xcite .",
    "in the course of our classification we have found operators with terms containing higher derivatives which resemble the covariant structure of the equations of motion ; there are also operators with terms which are proportional to the scalar part of the @xmath4 boson @xmath20 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that both types of structures can be eliminated in favor of other operators already present in the effective lagrangian .",
    "such a procedure is only valid at first order in the unknown effective parameters of the theory as any effective lagrangian is assumed to describe the effects of well - behaved new physics just in this approximation .",
    "consequently , after performing the required transformation , the equations of motions can be used to eliminate any redundant structure , expressing the respective operator in terms of other ones .",
    "this whole procedure does not affect the @xmath17-matrix elements . in order to present all the independent operators",
    ", we will classify them according to the following criterion : those which can not be reduced using the equations of motion will be referred to as irreducible , the remaining ones will be referred to as reducible .    after classifying the operators ,",
    "our paper will be concerned with the sensitivity of some precision experiments to new physics effects arising from tngbc .",
    "although persuasive theoretical arguments indicate that trilinear gauge boson couplings are not expected to be larger than the one percent @xcite , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) as well as the planned next linear collider ( nlc ) are expected to constrain them at a level of @xmath21@xmath22 @xcite . as long as tngbc",
    "are concerned , the size of their effects will be suppressed by powers of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the linear and the nonlinear scenarios , respectively .",
    "we will examine whether some high precision measurements may lead to any reasonable bound on these couplings .",
    "the anomalous @xmath25 couplings have been constrained from a global analysis of the lep / slc observables at the @xmath4 pole @xcite . to draw any inference about the size of tngbc",
    "we will consider the muon @xmath26 value , the known limit on the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron , and the current limit on the rare decay @xmath27 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "all the lowest dimension operators that generate tngbc in the linear scheme are presented in sec .",
    "ii , following the classification criterion already explained .",
    "besides , the respective lagrangians and vertex functions are shown explicitly . in sec .",
    "iii , a similar analysis within the nonlinear scenario is presented .",
    "iv is devoted to examine the possibility of obtaining constraints on the couplings out of high precision experiments .",
    "finally , the paper is closed with some concluding remarks in sec . v.",
    "this section focuses on the itemization of all the lowest dimension operators that generate at least one of the couplings @xmath15 , @xmath28 or @xmath1 within the linear realization of the @xmath29 electroweak group . to construct a basis of independent operators with a given dimension",
    ", we must consider some aspects concerning the independence of the @xmath17-matrix under a wide class of transformations which leave it invariant @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that some operators , which consist of a piece containing higher derivatives , can be eliminated in favor of others by using a specific transformation , leaving unchanged the @xmath17-matrix elements at any order of perturbation theory .",
    "another situation arises when an operator is proportional to the scalar part of the @xmath4 boson .",
    "while the latter kind of structures give vanishing contributions when the @xmath4 boson is on mass shell or is virtual but couples to light fermions , the situation is not the same in the case of the top quark . in this respect , this kind of operators can also be eliminated by performing a transformation which does not alter the @xmath17-matrix elements @xcite . it must be noted that both transformations are equivalent to applying the equations of motion . beside these considerations , we have made a systematic use of integration by parts to rule out any operator related to others through a surface term .",
    "consequently , we will catalog the operators inducing tngbc as reducible or irreducible .",
    "any @xmath12 invariant involving only bosonic fields can be constructed out of the covariant structures @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath34 , and @xmath32 is the higgs doublet . using these basic structures , we can built the following @xmath29 invariant and lorentz covariant structures of dimension two through five    @xmath35 , \\ , \\phi^{\\dag}(d_\\mu d_\\nu+d_\\nu d_\\mu)\\phi , \\ , \\phi^{\\dag}{\\bf w}_{\\mu \\nu}d_\\lambda\\phi.\\ ] ]    note that another set of @xmath12 invariant and lorentz covariant structures can be generated by operating with the ordinary derivative on these expressions .",
    "any nonrenormalizable bosonic operator can be built by choosing the appropriate combinations of these structures to form lorentz scalars .",
    "the ordinary derivative can act on the last expressions in several ways , but the contractions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , being proportional to the scalar part of the @xmath4 boson , are special because in both cases we can use the equations of motion to eliminate the resulting operator .",
    "let us now discuss the general lorentz structure of tngbc .",
    "the lowest dimension operators which can be assembled out of the basic structures have dimension six @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that no dimension six operator induce tngbc , which unavoidably leads to search for eight dimension operators . in principle , the combination which can give rise to tngbc may involve the 4-vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 , together with the antisymmetric tensors @xmath40 and @xmath41 . owing to @xmath18 gauge symmetry , the electromagnetic field can only appear as @xmath38 through the respective covariant derivative , which operates on charged fields only . therefore , the photon must appear in any term through the tensor field @xmath42 . due to the antisymmetry of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 tensors ,",
    "it is not possible to generate tngbc using only these structures : it would be necessary to have at our disposal three antisymmetric tensors .",
    "there follows the absence of the @xmath44 vertex in this gauge invariant scheme .    to construct the @xmath15 , @xmath45 , and @xmath10 vertices",
    ", we must use at least a @xmath4 boson in the @xmath39 form , which is allowed because this field couples to neutral fields .",
    "the 4-vector @xmath39 is contained in the covariant derivative , which in the bosonic sector operates only on the higgs doublet . as a consequence ,",
    "the higgs mechanism plays a special role in this type of couplings .",
    "in particular , the higgs presence increases the dimension at which the operators can be generated in comparison to the nonlinear case , where this field is absent .",
    "the @xmath4 boson may appear through the combinations @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the building blocks necessary to construct these couplings are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , which , after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , induce the structures @xmath39 , @xmath48 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the irreducible operators may contribute to a given physical process through the specific structure of tngbc , while the reducible ones may contribute to it via contact diagrams in which an internal line associated with either a @xmath4 boson or a photon has been amputated , for instance when the equations of motion are used to replace the term @xmath53 with the respective current .",
    "therefore , the irreducible operators deserve a more careful study than the reducible ones .",
    "we will present thus the lagrangians and vertex functions in the irreducible case , whereas in the reducible case we will list only the respective operators and the lagrangian prescribing the off - shell electromagnetic properties of the @xmath4 boson . in the next section we will enumerate the operators of dimension eight that generate tngbc .",
    "we begin by classifying those operators which can not be eliminated using the equations of motion .",
    "we will categorize them according to @xmath54 symmetry .",
    "the operators we are interested in have the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is any of the @xmath13 invariant expressions shown in ( [ builbloc ] ) . given these operators it is immediate to construct the new ones @xmath57 , which also belong to the irreducible group , but they are not independent at all since they are related to the original operators through a surface term . bearing this in mind , we obtain the following four independent @xmath54-odd operators of dimension eight    @xmath58+h.c.,\\\\ { \\cal o}_{wb1}&=&i(\\phi^\\dag { \\bf w}_{\\mu \\nu } d_\\lambda \\phi)\\partial^\\lambda b^{\\mu \\nu}+h.c . , \\\\ { \\cal",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that the operator @xmath59 contains three @xmath29 invariant structures which can be contracted with the ordinary derivative in three different ways , leading to the same number of operators .",
    "one of them , namely @xmath60 , is irreducible , but can be expressed by means of integration by parts in terms of @xmath61 and the reducible operator @xmath62 , which will be considered later .",
    "the 4-vector @xmath39 arises from the term @xmath64 after ssb , whereas the antisymmetric field tensors @xmath42 and @xmath65 appear through the relations    @xmath66    @xmath67    where @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the weak mixing angle . after the decomposition of these operators in terms of the mass eigenstate fields , we are left with several lorentz structures corresponding to tngbc , though not all of them are independent .",
    "some of them are identical , which is manifest after a subtle manipulation of their lorentz indices , whereas other ones are related through a surface term .",

    "we thus obtain a simple expression for the @xmath45 vertex    @xmath277,\\ ] ]    which do show an obvious connection with ( [ zzgpar ] ) . instead of giving explicit expressions for @xmath278 and @xmath279",
    ", we will establish the connection of @xmath280 and @xmath281 with the coefficients @xmath282 and @xmath283 appearing in ( [ cpodd])-([cpeven ] ) for the linear scenario and ( [ cpoddnl])-([cpevennl ] ) for the nonlinear case .",
    "we thus have    @xmath284    @xmath285    the same relation holds for these coefficients in the nonlinear scenario .",
    "explicit expressions from @xmath278 and @xmath279 can be easily extracted from ( [ fzzgl ] ) and ( [ gzzgl ] ) .    finally , a few comments are in order .",
    "although the @xmath45 has the same lorentz structure in both realizations of the @xmath13 gauge symmetry , the main difference is that the operators inducing these structures are of dimension six in the nonlinear scenario , whereas in the linear case they are induced by dimension eight operators . as a result , though the bounds found for the coefficients @xmath280 and @xmath281 apply in both scenarios , if they were translated into the operator coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath160 , looser bounds would be obtained in the linear scenario . regarding the remaining tgbc , a similar analysis following the lines sketched above",
    "was done for the @xmath15 and @xmath286 couplings .",
    "it was found that our results agree with those previously presented .",
    "another interesting point to be noted is that , since the operators which induce the most general tngbc vertices also induce those couplings with only one off - shell particle , any bound which has been put on the latter will be immediately applicable to the former .",
    "in this work we have presented an analysis of trilinear neutral gauge boson couplings , @xmath15 , @xmath45 and @xmath10 , under the context of the effective lagrangian approach , both in the linear and the nonlinear realizations of the @xmath12 gauge symmetry .",
    "particular emphasis has been given to the linear scenario since current literature lacks of an analysis in this line .",
    "the most general case with three off - shell bosons is considered . in the linear scenario",
    "these couplings receive contributions from dimension eight operators , whereas in the nonlinear scenario they are induced by dimension six operators . for completeness",
    ", we have included the lorentz structure which parametrizes these vertices , ready to be used in any future calculation .",
    "based on general considerations and actual calculations , we conclude that , if the until now unknown physics underlying the sm is of a decoupling nature , it is not expected that tngbc could have a considerable impact either through their virtual effects or via direct production . in contrast , if new physics effects arise from a strong coupling regime at higher energies which is responsible for the breaking of the @xmath13 symmetry ( endowing the gauge bosons with mass ) , the possibility of measuring their effects still remains .",
    "the el approach indicates that , owing to the suppression of the operators inducing tngbc , it is difficult that the effects arising from them may compete with those coming from other sources of new physics induced by lower dimension operators .",
    "however , it may happen that some fortuitous fact , such as some resonant effect , could give rise to large tngbc in a particular model . in this context",
    ", it would be useful a study in a model dependent way to have more evidences which could lead us to a deeper understanding of tngbc .",
    "financial support from conacyt and sni ( mxico ) is acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix the vertex functions for the @xmath15 , @xmath45 , and @xmath10 couplings within the linear scenario are presented .",
    "we consider the most general case where the three bosons are virtual .",
    "the particle momenta are denoted as described below and will be taken as incoming everywhere .",
    "the @xmath54-odd vertex functions are given by + @xmath287 vertex :    @xmath288    @xmath289    @xmath290 vertex :    @xmath291    @xmath292    @xmath293 vertex :    @xmath294    @xmath295    following the same conventions , the @xmath54-even vertex functions are given by + @xmath15 vertex :    @xmath296    @xmath297    @xmath45 vertex :    @xmath298    @xmath299    @xmath10 vertex :    @xmath300    @xmath301    note that the vertex functions vanish for three on - shell particles .",
    "they are also symmetric under the interchange of identical particles , in perfect agreement with bose symmetry .",
    "we are using the same conventions used in the linear case .",
    "the @xmath54-odd vertex functions can be written in terms of those of the linear scenario plus some new terms + @xmath15 vertex :                              g. snchez - coln and j. wudka , phys .",
