    "we note that the broadest resonance shown is in fact narrower than typical broad resonances found in the experimentally relevant ultracold atomic systems , but differs from the infinitely broad resonance results by at most a few percent .",

    "<S> atoms which do not lie along a principal axis can pair to form a molecule , but this effect is much weaker than diagonal tunneling for the completely even parity dressed molecule .    in the derivation of the frh we use only the bound states of the projected problem and neglect scattering states in higher bands . </S>",
    "<S> this captures the scattering states in the lowest band and nearby bound states , but will fail to capture the physics at higher two - particle relative energy where scattering states in higher bands can play a role . in order to accommodate these scattering states , one can project out higher bands from @xmath57 as was done for the lowest band , and then include these bands dynamically in the many - body hamiltonian with renormalized couplings . in this way </S>",

    "<S> the frh is an accurate representation of the many - body hamiltonian . </S>",
