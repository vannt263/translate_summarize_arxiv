    "molecular chains with intra - molecular contacts are topologically diverse . this is true even in the absence of branching and knot formation and is rooted in the variety of contact arrangements available to the chain ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , left ) .",
    "circuit topology formalizes this notion using discrete mathematics and sets the stage for classification as well as functional and evolutionary analysis of ( bio-)molecular chains based on their structural topology @xcite .",
    "two chains with the same circuit topology may differ in total length and length of inter - contact segments but have equal number of contacts with identical contact arrangements .",
    "circuit topology of a chain is a determinant of its function and dynamics and is in turn determined by the physico - chemical properties of the chain and its environment @xcite .",
    "for example , folding rate of an isolated chain correlates with the number of contact pairs in parallel arrangement @xcite .",
    "the topology influences whether distinct intermediate states are visited during folding and unfolding .",
    "here crossed contacts are found to be the key determinants @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "intrinsic and extrinsic factors determine the topological diversity of biomolecules .",
    "it is well established that the distribution of positively charged residues is a key determinant of membrane protein topology @xcite .",
    "when folding of a chain occurs while the chain is sequentially synthesized , certain topologies might be kinetically populated .",
    "evolutionary constraints also select for certain topologies with desired stability and functionality @xcite .",
    "slow folding chains are prone to unwanted interactions and aggregation and thus are disfavored .",
    "the constraints , such as those discussed above , are not represented in the free energy landscape of the chain , which maps conformations of isolated chains to their corresponding free energies .",
    "chain models with contacts have served as prototypes in theories of biomolecular chains and in particular rna and protein folding and can be used to study circuit topology . because the length of the chain is irrelevant in a topological treatment , the model can be further simplified by considering only the contacts and setting the length of every chain segment to unity .",
    "contacts can be displayed as links between the contact sites .",
    "the chain will then be modeled by a connected graph in which the nodes correspond to the contact sites , the ordered sequence of contact sites corresponds to the polymer backbone and the remaining links represent the intra - chain contacts .",
    "the latter forms a perfect matching of the graph .",
    "this graph representation of the chain shrinks the conformational space of the chain to a topological space .    studying",
    "the topological diversity is technically challenging .",
    "the problem of sampling from the exponentially large space of contact configurations ( perfect matchings ) could be very time consuming for disordered and frustrated energy functions .",
    "an efficient way of sampling from such energy landscapes in sparsely ( weakly ) interacting systems is provided by the cavity method of statistical physics , relying on the bethe approximation @xcite .",
    "the recursive and local nature of these equations are exploited in approximate message - passing algorithms that have proven useful in the study of random constraint satisfaction and optimization problems @xcite .    in this article , we discuss the statistical mechanical properties of a single chain that forms intra - chain binary contacts in the context of circuit topology .",
    "we use the bethe approximation to characterize the space of contact ( link ) configurations assuming an energy function of two - link interactions depending on their relative position in the polymer chain .",
    "we illustrate the constraints imposed by the energy function on the configuration space , and obtain the one - link and two - link probability distributions to see how the links are organized by changing the relevant parameters in the energy function .",
    "we also obtain the entropy ( logarithm of the number of contact configurations ) in terms of the two - link densities in the energy function of the system .",
    "we will see how a subset of correlated contact sites identified by a sector @xcite affects the statistical properties of the chain .",
    "in particular , for specific frustrating energy functions the entropy displays a maximum for sector sizes close to half the number of contact sites .",
    "finally , given the one - link and two - link data from structured link configurations , we try to reconstruct the energy function that statistically describes the observed data .",
    "using this information , we can recover the contact sites of regular sectors of different sizes with an accuracy that approaches one as the number of sector sites increases .     in series ( s ) ,",
