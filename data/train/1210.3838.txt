    "mantle dynamics in the stagnant - lid regime , however , can be more complex than previously thought owing to the effects of mantle processing and crustal formation , and the scaling law of stagnant - lid convection that takes such complications into account has been developed only recently @xcite .",

    "the formulation of core cooling is identical to that of @xcite .",
    "second , the energy balance for the mantle is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius of the mantle ; @xmath13 is the volumetric heat production of the mantle ; @xmath14 is the density of the mantle ; @xmath15 is the specific heat of the mantle ; @xmath16 is the ratio of the average temperature of the mantle to @xmath17 , the potential temperature of the mantle ( a hypothetical temperature of the mantle adiabatically brought up to the surface without melting ) ; @xmath18 is volumetric melt production with associated latent heat release , @xmath19 ; and @xmath20 is the heat flux across the mantle / crust boundary .",
    "some of the above parameters are universal constants , but most are planet - specific .",
    "many important parameters are also time - varying .",
    "in particular , mantle melt is extracted to form crust , causing @xmath12 to decrease with time .",
    "likewise , @xmath13 decreases with time because of radioactive decay with some approximated average decay constant , @xmath21 @xcite , and extraction through mantle processing .",
    "figure  [ fig : cartoon ] illustrates the assumed thermal and chemical structure in our model . over time , melting processes an upper region of the original primitive mantle ( pm ) to form the crust and the depleted mantle lithosphere ( dml ) . in parallel",
    ", the mantle lithosphere ( ml ) , which is always thicker than the dml , develops as a conductive thermal boundary layer underlying the crust . as part of the dml",
    "can potentially delaminate and be mixed with the convecting mantle , the composition of the convecting mantle can be more depleted than that of the pm .",
    "the mantle below the dml is thus referred to as the source mantle ( sm ) , the composition of which is initially identical to the composition of the pm but can deviate with time .",
    "the history of these layers strongly depends on convective vigor , effects of mantle melting , and initial conditions .",
    "standard parameterizations are used for mantle rheology and the vigor of convection .",
    "mantle viscosity is a function of mantle potential temperature and the degree of hydration as @xcite @xmath22 , \\label{eq : visc}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a constant factor calculated using a reference viscosity @xmath24 at a reference temperature @xmath25 = 1573  k ; @xmath26 is the activation energy ; @xmath27 is the universal gas constant ; and @xmath28 is the viscosity contrast between wet and dry mantle .",
    "we use an activation energy of @xmath26 = 300 kj mol@xmath29 , which is appropriate for diffusion creep and dislocation creep within a newtonian approximation @xcite .",
    "the normalized water concentration in the source mantle , @xmath30 , has an initial value of one and decreases toward zero as mantle melting causes dehydration . to write eq .",
    "[ eq : visc ] , we make the major assumption that mantle viscosity is not strongly pressure - dependent , which is consistent with early studies of the evolution of large rocky planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and some theoretical predictions @xcite but in contrast to recent work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our choice is thus further explained in the discussion section .",
    "two non - dimensional parameters characterize thermal convection with the above viscosity formulation @xcite . first , the internal rayleigh number serves to quantify potential convective vigor @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the coefficient of thermal expansion ; @xmath33 is the thermal diffusivity ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are , respectively , the temperature at the bottom of the crust ( called `` moho temperature '' ) and the mantle potential temperature defined at the top of the mantle ; and @xmath36 is the thickness of the mantle .",
    "second , the frank - kamenetskii parameter is defined as @xcite @xmath37    with these two parameters , the average convective velocity beneath the stagnant - lid may be calculated as @xcite @xmath38 to include the effects of compositional buoyancy and dehydration stiffening , the nusselt number , which is a non - dimensional measure of convective heat flux , must be calculated with a local stability analysis at each time step @xcite .",
    "the symbolic functionality may be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the density and viscosity contrasts between the source mantle and depleted mantle , respectively , and @xmath42 is the thickness of the depleted mantle lithosphere .",
    "the thickness of a thermal boundary layer in the mantle is then easily calculated using @xmath43    the chemical evolution of the mantle strongly affects terrestrial planet evolution . to first order , partial melting of the mantle",
    "can be considered to begin at a depth where the temperature exceeds the solidus of dry peridotite , as long as the mantle is not significantly wet @xcite .",
    "the initial pressure of melting is @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the adiabatic mantle gradient , which is roughly constant for the pressure range relevant to mantle melting .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 should be approximately constant for any terrestrial planet with earth - like mantle composition .",
    "melting stops when the convective upwelling reaches the base of the mantle lithosphere .",
    "that is , the final pressure of melting is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the thicknesses of the crust ; @xmath49 is gravitational acceleration ; and @xmath50 is the density of the lithosphere . for convenience ,",
    "we use the martian @xmath14 as @xmath50 , noting that @xmath50 should remain roughly constant whereas @xmath14 , an averaged mantle parameter , increases with planetary mass because of pressure effects .",
    "if @xmath51 , then melting occurs in the melting zone between @xmath46 and @xmath52 , with thickness @xmath53 and average melt fraction equal to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the melt productivity by adiabatic decompression .",
    "volumetric melt productivity is finally parametrized as @xmath56 where @xmath57 if the upwelling mantle is cylindrical and all downwelling occurs at the cylinder s edge @xcite .",
    "the crustal temperature profile is calculated as in @xcite , with the modification that crustal material with a temperature above @xmath58 = 1273 k is considered to be buoyant melt that migrates within one time step immediately below the planet s surface , producing a relatively cooler crust and a larger mantle heat flux .",
    "this modification is not important for martian cases , because the moho temperature does not reach the threshold except for some extreme cases , but becomes essential to achieve a realistic crustal thermal profile for larger planets .",
    "thermal evolution models featuring stagnant - lid convection are not applicable to planets on which plate tectonics occurs .",
    "if a suitable weakening mechanism exists , the lithosphere may be broken into plates and recycled into the mantle .",
    "many aspects of plate tectonics on earth , however , are not captured in current mathematical models @xcite .",
    "quantifying the conditions under which plate tectonics is favored over stagnant - lid convection is likewise difficult , and the effect of planetary mass on the likelihood of plate tectonics has been controversial @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest , however , that the effects of planetary mass on yield and convective stresses may be dominated by uncertainties in other important planetary parameters , such as internal heating and lithosphere hydration @xcite .",
    "this study uses a simple scaling that is consistent with current understanding of rock mechanics @xcite , though the possibility of different lithosphere weakening mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not be excluded .",
    "we assume that plate tectonics can occur if convective stress exceeds the brittle strength of lithosphere given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cohesive strength , @xmath61 is the effective friction coefficient , and @xmath62 is depth @xcite .",
    "experimental data indicate that the cohesive strength is negligible under lithospheric conditions , i.e. , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "we use another non - dimensional parameter @xcite : @xmath64 where the relevant temperature difference is the difference between the mantle potential and surface temperatures . in the parameterized convection model formulated in the previous section , we separately consider the crust and the mantle , but when discussing the likelihood of plate tectonics using the scaling of @xcite , it is more convenient to treat the crust and mantle together , assuming that crustal rheology is similar to mantle rheology .",
    "detailed scaling analyses @xcite show that the effective viscosity contrast across the lithosphere can be parameterized as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the frank - kamenetskii parameter defined using the total temperature difference explained above , i.e. , @xmath67 a transition from plate - tectonic to stagnant - lid convection can take place if the above viscosity contrast exceeds a critical value @xmath68 where @xmath69 is defined to incorporate surface temperature as @xmath70    for each simulation , if @xmath71 at any time , then plate tectonics may have been favored at some point during the evolution of a given planet .",
    "the satisfaction of this criterion may strongly depend on the value of @xmath61 , so a wide range of values should be tested . for silicate rocks , plausible values of @xmath61 range from 0.6 to 0.7 , according to both laboratory studies @xcite and measurements of crustal strength on earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "surface water , however , may lower these values substantially via thermal cracking and mantle hydration @xcite .",
    "the parametrized model described above was used to calculate thermal histories of mars- and venus - like planets and 1 to 10@xmath0 super - venus planets , where the @xmath72 subscript denotes parameters for earth , for a duration of 4.5  gyr using numerical integration with a time step of 1  myr .",
    "a wide parameter space was explored by varying the initial mantle potential temperature , @xmath73 ; the initial core / mantle boundary temperature , @xmath74 ; the initial volumetric heat production , @xmath75 ; the reference mantle viscosity , @xmath24 ; and the viscosity contrast between dry and wet mantle , @xmath76 .",

    "more specifically , moho temperature increases with crustal thickness in a linear fashion until @xmath150 km , after which moho temperatures remain near the critical value for basalt melting . simulations with crustal melting have highly discontinuous surface and mantle heat fluxes , but such discontinuous nature is merely an artifact owing to our particular numerical implementation , so average values of @xmath151 and @xmath20 over the final 100 myr of planetary evolution are used for all subsequent analyses .",
    "in contrast , moho temperatures for mars only approach the critical value for basalt melting in simulations with the thickest crust .",
    "unlike for venus , a decrease in present - day mantle heat flux accompanies an increase in crustal thickness for mars .            principal component analysis facilitates the interpretation of the correlations between output parameters . for venus , two principal components account for most ( @xmath15265@xmath153 ) of the variance of the planetary parameters after 4.5 gyr of thermal evolution .",

    "no preferred polarity exists for the principal component eigenvectors ; plotting these arrows with a 180@xmath154 rotation would be equally valid .",
    "the first principal component represents the most dominant correlations among present - day planetary parameters , which are characterized mainly by the thicknesses of the crust and mantle lithosphere layers , as they are associated with large coefficients : @xmath48 ( 0.34 ) , @xmath42 ( -0.36 ) , and @xmath155 ( -0.39 ) . because the sign of the coefficient for @xmath48 is opposite to the sign of the other two coefficients , the thicknesses of the crust and mantle lithosphere are anti - correlated . in other words ,",
    "thick crust is associated with thin depleted mantle lithosphere and a thin thermal boundary layer and vice versa , since principal components have no preferred polarity .",
    "an initially hotter mantle produces thicker crust and thicker depleted lithosphere . because mantle viscosity is lower for hotter mantle , however , the depleted lithosphere is more likely to be destabilized , resulting in a thinner lithosphere ( and thus thermal boundary layer ) for thicker crust .",
    "other coefficients in the first principal component indicate the effects of crustal thickness on other model parameters , including the first - order correlations observed during inspection of fig .  [",
    "fig : venus_pca ] .",
    "for instance , thick crust is associated with high moho temperature and high surface and mantle heat fluxes .",
    "thick crust also indicates a high degree of mantle processing and a corresponding low present - day mantle water content .",
    "finally , the large negative coefficients for both @xmath156 and @xmath157 indicate that thick crust tends to form early and quickly .",
    "the second principal component elucidates the effects of planet temperatures on other model parameters , since large coefficients are associated with @xmath17 ( 0.45 ) and @xmath8 ( 0.44 ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , high mantle potential and core / mantle boundary temperatures are associated with high moho temperature , since @xmath34 has a coefficient of 0.25 . moreover , high interior temperatures correspond to thick crust and a high degree of mantle processing , which would cause the present - day mantle water concentration to be very low .",
    "note , however , that high ( present - day ) interior temperatures do not correspond to thick crust in case of the first principal component ( fig .",
    "4b ) . in this space of crustal thickness and upper mantle temperature , the first and second principal components are nearly orthogonal , thus explaining the overall spread of simulation results . with principal component analysis , we can visualize how the most dominant trend ( represented by the first principal component ) is affected by secondary factors and how these secondary factors manifest in different parameter spaces .",
    "an important point is that the overall variability of planetary evolution can be compactly represented by a small number of principal components ; that is , the effective dimension of the model space is actually small .",
    "the principal components for mars are very similar to those for venus , with some notable exceptions .",
    "the first principal component again represents the effects of strongly correlated moho temperature and crustal thickness , and thus explains the largest portion of the variance in the model output . as for venus , a thin , cold crust is associated with thick depleted mantle lithosphere , a thick thermal boundary layer , a low surface heat flux , and a low degree of mantle processing . unlike venus , however , the surface and mantle heat fluxes in the first principal component are anti - correlated ( see also fig .

    "some present - day parameters are found to be predicted with reasonable accuracy for venus and mars using a linear function .",

    "first , massive terrestrial planets in the stagnant - lid regime feature crustal temperature profiles that enter the stability field of eclogite after crust grows beyond a critical thickness .",
    "if a sufficiently large fraction of the total crustal thickness is composed of eclogite , the entire crust could be gravitationally unstable and susceptible to foundering because eclogite is intrinsically denser than mantle peridotite .    on earth ,",
    "the phase transition from ( metamorphosed ) basalt to eclogite primarily occurs in subduction zones .",
    "hydration may thus be important to allowing this phase transition to occur relatively rapidly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this type of kinetic calculation strongly depends on diffusion data that are not well - constrained ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "eclogite is also formed during continent - continent collisions such as the eurasian and indian plate collisions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high density of eclogite is theorized to have caused delamitation , foundering , and recycling of relatively thick oceanic lithosphere on earth during the archaean @xcite .",
    "finally , eclogite may be produced in large mountain ranges through magmatic differentiation @xcite and pressure - induced phase transition @xcite in thick continental crust .",
    "evidence for the strong influence of recent eclogite production and foundering on the topography of the central andes mountains has been gathered through geodynamics , petrology , and seismology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as synthesized in a numerical study @xcite .",
    "because massive terrestrial planets have relatively high surface gravity , the phase transition to eclogite will occur at a comparatively shallow depth , making eclogite the stable mineral phase for a large fraction of the crust .",
    "the formation of a thick eclogite layer then could cause lithosphere foundering or intermittent plate tectonics , as has been proposed in episodic subduction mechanisms for venus @xcite .",
    "representative temperature profiles for massive terrestrial planets pass through the eclogite stability field for plausible initial conditions .",
    "in fact , radiogenic heating and thus crustal temperatures should be greater than calculated with eq .",
    "[ eq : temp_profile ] , which would increase the speed of the phase transition to eclogite , because crustal construction mostly occurs early in planetary history . for super - venus planets with masses greater than @xmath1084@xmath0",
    ", eclogite may be the stable phase for the majority of the crust unless the initial mantle potential temperature or magnitude of internal heating is very low .",
    "so , crust material may undergo a phase transition to eclogite at relatively shallow depths as the crust grows during thermal evolution in the stagnant - lid regime , forming a thick eclogite layer that could subsequently founder . the buoyant stress from the presence of eclogite scales as @xmath236 , where @xmath237 @xmath108 100 kg m@xmath82 is the difference between the densities of eclogite and the mantle .",
    "on the other hand , the lithospheric strength scales as @xmath238 , which can only be overcome when the depth scale of the eclogitic layer becomes large enough ( at least locally , for example , by foundering ) .",
    "as long as crustal production continues on large rocky planets , eclogite formation and foundering could occur periodically , possibly yielding a regime of mantle convection resembling intermittent plate tectonics .",
    "although we suggest that this process is plausible , pursuing its dynamics in detail is left for future studies .",
    "high surface and crustal temperatures may also cause periodic transitions from the stagnant - lid regime to a form of mobile - lid convection . in this work ,",
    "massive terrestrial planets in the stagnant - lid regime with surface temperatures held constant at 300 k tend to have very hot crusts .",
    "if high surface temperatures exist alongside high crustal temperatures , a transition from stagnant - lid convection to a mobile - lid regime can occur @xcite .",
    "feedback between a changing mantle convection regime and a periodic atmospheric greenhouse effect driven by varying amounts of volcanism , for instance , may be very important to the evolution of venus @xcite .",
    "as surface temperature depends on atmospheric mass and the composition and luminosity of the central star , however , this possibility of escaping the stagnant - lid regime may not be as robust as the first mechanism based on the formation of self - destabilizing crust      any parameterized model suffers shortcomings .",
    "steady - state evolution is assumed , for instance , which poorly captures transient events that occur early in planetary evolution such as large impacts @xcite and the crystallization of a magma ocean ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "fundamental assumptions such an adiabatic temperature gradient in the mantle and pressure - independent potential viscosity are controversial , and different approaches such as mixing length theory @xcite may be necessary to calculate the thermal structure of planetary interiors if they are not valid . however , our simplified simulations only aim to illuminate the first - order , relative effects of planetary mass on terrestrial planet evolution . recreating the thermal history of a particular planet would require the introduction of many additional complications .",
    "one - dimensional models only return globally averaged values for important quantities , for instance , but mantle plumes , which may upwell from the core / mantle boundary when the core heat flux is positive , are likely important to local magmatism and surface features on terrestrial planets like mars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and venus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , applying a parameterized approach to venus , where the precise quantity of magmatism is an key output , requires more computationally intensive simulations to benchmark the relevant scaling laws .",
    "terrestrial planet evolution is complicated . although plate tectonics is observed on earth , the stagnant - lid regime of mantle convection may be most natural for terrestrial planets ; at least , it is most common in our solar system .",
    "thermal evolution models in this study yield first - order , relative conclusions about the evolution of generic terrestrial planets in the stagnant - lid regime .",
    "principal component analysis of simulation results conducted with a wide range of initial conditions captures the relationships between the large number of parameters that describe the interior of a planet .",
    "depending on initial conditions , these planets may have evolved along a variety of paths , featuring different crustal thicknesses and temperatures , interior temperatures , and degrees of mantle processing . to produce specific histories consistent with spacecraft data obtained from mars and venus , complications must be added to these simple models .",
    "properties of massive terrestrial exoplanets are poorly constrained , so questions about the effects of planetary mass on the likelihood of plate tectonics and other important planetary parameters await definitive answers . in this study , we explored what might happen if internal viscosity is not strongly - pressure dependent , the alternative to which has been explored previously using parameterized models .",
    "although convective vigor increases with planetary mass , the likelihood of plate tectonics is only marginally improved .",
    "simple scaling analyses indicate that mantle melt productivity should increase with planetary mass . because the increase in mantle processing is slow , however , crustal thickness and the relative fraction of processed mantle actually decrease with increasing planetary mass , as thermal evolution simulations confirm .",
    "surface gravity increases with planetary mass , so pressure in the crust of massive terrestrial planets increases relatively rapidly with depth .",
    "plausible temperature profiles favor a phase transition to gravitationally unstable eclogite during normal crustal formation , whereas the basalt to eclogite transformation rarely occurs aside from subduction on earth .",
    "therefore , thick eclogite layers , along with mobile , hot crustal material , may be important to the evolution of massive terrestrial planets .",
    "ct space grant and the george j. schultz fellowship from yale university s silliman college supported j. orourke .",
    "constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers considerably improved the content and clarity of this manuscript .",
