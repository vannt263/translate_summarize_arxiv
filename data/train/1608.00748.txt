    ", one sends a certain electromagnetic wave field , and the wave propagation will be interrupted / perturbed when meeting with the obstacle .",
    "the perturbation is the so - called scattering , and one intends to recover the obstacle by measuring the scattered wave away from the obstacle .",
    "the inverse scattering problem is of fundamental importance to many areas of science and technology , including radar / sonar , geophysical exploration , medical imaging , as well as remote sensing ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote , respectively , the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the isotropic homogeneous medium in @xmath2 .",

    "the electromagnetic wave propagation is governed by the maxwell equations @xmath9 for time - harmonic electromagnetic waves of the form @xmath10 with frequency @xmath11 , it is directly verified that one has the reduced maxwell equations @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the wavenumber .",
    "the em wave field can not penetrate inside the obstacle @xmath5 , and hence the maxwell system is defined only in @xmath14 , and on the boundary @xmath15 , one has @xmath16 respectively , corresponding to a perfectly electric conducting ( pec ) obstacle or a perfectly magnetic conducting ( pmc ) obstacle . here ,",
    "@xmath17 denote the exterior unit normal vector to @xmath15 .",
    "the total wave fields @xmath18 are given as @xmath19 where for the present study , we take @xmath20 here @xmath21 in are known as the normalized electromagnetic plane wave with the polarization vector @xmath22 and incident direction @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 , while @xmath25 , @xmath26 in are known as the scattered electric and magnetic fields , respectively , and they are required to satisfy the silver - mller radiation condition as follows , @xmath27 which holds uniformly for all directions @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the maxwell system  is well understood and there exists a unique pair of solutions @xmath31 ( cf .",

    "the inverse scattering problem that we are concerned with is to recover @xmath5 by the knowledge of @xmath38 .",
    "the inverse problem is widely known to be nonlinear and ill - posed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . there is a longstanding problem in the literature on whether and how one can recover the obstacle @xmath5 by using a single far - field measurement ; that is , @xmath42 given for all @xmath43 but fixed @xmath44 and @xmath41 ( see @xcite ) . physically speaking ,",
    "a single far - field measurement is obtained by sending a single incident plane wave and then collecting the electric far - field data in every observation direction .",
    "it is remarked that @xmath35 ( respectively , @xmath36 ) is a real - analytic function on @xmath45 , and hence if it is known on any open patch of the unit sphere , then it is known on the whole sphere by the analytic continuation ( cf .",
    "it is easily seen that the inverse problem is formally posed with a single far - field measurement .",
    "hence , there is a widespread belief that one can establish the recovery by a single far - field measurement , though it still remains to be a very challenging issue .",
    "we refer to @xcite for some theoretical and computational progress on the investigation of the recovery for the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem by making use of as few measurement data as possible .",
    "another extremely challenging issue for the inverse scattering problem is about the recovery by the phaseless data , say the modulus of the electric far - field pattern , @xmath46 . to our best knowledge",
    ", there is very little progress in the literature on the phaseless recovery for the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem described above .    in our recent work @xcite ,",
    "a novel scheme was developed for the reconstruction of a polyhedral obstacle by a few acoustic backscattering measurements .",
    "the scheme is based on the high - frequency asymptotics of the acoustic wave scattering , namely the kirchhoff or the physical optics approximation . using the high - frequency asymptotic approximation , it is shown in @xcite that the modulus of the acoustic far - field pattern in the backscattering aperture possesses a certain local maximum behavior , from which one can determine the exterior normal directions of the front faces of the obstacle .",
    "then by a few backscattering measurements corresponding to several properly chosen incident plane waves , one can determine the exterior normal directions of the faces of the obstacle .",
    "after the determination of the exterior face normals , the recovery of the whole obstacle is reduced into a finite dimensional algebraic problem , which can be easily solved . in this work , we shall significant extend the study @xcite in two aspects .",
    "first , the study in @xcite is to recover a polygon in the 2d plane , whereas in this study we shall recover a polyhedron in the 3d space .",
    "as we shall see , this will create much more difficulties in both theoretical and computational aspects .",
    "second , the study in @xcite mainly concerns the acoustic scattering governed by the scalar helmholtz system , whereas in the present paper , we shall be concerned with the much more complicated vectorial maxwell system .",
    "the proposed scheme for the recovery of an electromagnetic obstacle follows a similar spirit to @xcite by using the high - frequency asymptotics of the electromagnetic waves as well as the local maximum behavior of the backscattering far - field pattern .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that the extension is highly nontrivial and technical .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using the physical optics approximation , we prove the local maximum behavior of the modulus of the electric far - field pattern in the backscattering aperture . in section 3",
    ", we present the recovery scheme .",
    "section 4 is devoted to numerical examples , which illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed recovery scheme .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we consider the local maximum behavior of the modulus of the electric far - field pattern @xmath47 corresponding to a polyhedral obstacle @xmath5 .",
    "it is first noted that due the symmetric role of the electric field @xmath48 and the magnetic field @xmath49 , we would consider the scattering from a pec obstacle only .",
    "indeed , it is easily verified by letting @xmath50 and @xmath51 that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence , if @xmath5 is a pmc obstacle with respect to @xmath54 , then it is a pec obstacle with respect to @xmath55 . therefore , we focus on the pec case in what follows and all our subsequent results derived for the scattering from a pec obstacle equally hold for the scattering from a pmc obstacle .    throughout the rest of this section , we let @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 be fixed .",

    "condition means that the polyhedron is of regular size ( with respect to the wavelength ) . generically speaking",
    ", condition excludes the case when two faces in a back - view of @xmath5 are nearly parallel to each other .",
    "condition means no face of @xmath5 can be too small and condition means the faces of @xmath5 are mildly `` round '' .",
    "it is worth to point out that only the first three conditions are required in the two - dimensional case .",
    "let @xmath70 be another fixed a priori constant .",
    "a face @xmath71 is said to be _ significant _ with respect to the incident direction @xmath41 if @xmath72 intuitively speaking , condition means @xmath60 is not too parallel to @xmath41 so that the scattered field contributed by @xmath60 is significant .",
