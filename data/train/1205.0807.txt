    "this statistical error is thus not a primary concern .",
    "another source of uncertainty stems from our assumptions about stellar parameters .",
    "we find the effects of reasonably large systematic over / underestimates in each of log@xmath34 ( @xmath82 dex ) , @xmath53 ( @xmath83 k ) , and @xmath54 ( @xmath82 dex ) , to be @xmath84 dex , @xmath85 dex , @xmath85 dex in [ fe / h ] respectively .",
    "summing these effects in quadrature yields an uncertainty of @xmath86 dex on our derived metallicities .",
    "a further possible source of bias in [ fe / h ] is contamination of the iron abundance fitting region by lines of other elements , most notably ca ( see figure [ fe_plot ] ) . in determining [ fe / h ]",
    ", we generated synthetic spectra assuming that [ x / fe]=0 for all x. while [ x / fe ] is not known for monoceros , the most relevant parameter of [ ca / fe ] for the galactic disk / halo tends to lie between 0.0 and 0.4 .",
    "we address the resulting [ fe / h ] bias by using moog to simulate populations of stars with [ ca / fe ] following the known galactic trend with [ fe / h ] ( see @xmath36[ca_cont ] ) , adding appropriate noise to the synthetic spectra before feeding them back into our [ fe / h ] fitter .",
    "the resulting bias is very small , @xmath870.02 dex .",
    "a final important source of uncertainty is the continuum normalization procedure . with our low resolution",
    ", the blending of lines means the continuum is rarely achieved , and could potentially be systematically over / underestimated throughout the sample , thereby raising / lowering all metallicities . to test the systematic effect due to differing continuum normalizations",
    ", we again re - fit abundances with new continua parameterized by a polynomial two orders lower than the default continuum .",
    "we find in general a resulting systematic offset of 0.07 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "we assign a final systematic uncertainty of 0.13 dex to our [ fe / h ] distributions , adding the errors from continuum fitting and stellar parameters in quadrature .",
    "this value is somewhat conservative , as much of this uncertainty ( particularly the continuum normalization ) has been calibrated out with the m13 data .",
    "we find , through simulations similar to those previously described , that the observed [ fe / h ] scatter is well described by a combination of both poisson noise and statistical scatter of the underlying stellar parameters , again at the level of @xmath88k in @xmath53 , @xmath89 dex in both @xmath54 and log@xmath34 .",
    "thus , summing these sources of scatter in quadrature , we find for typical s / n and @xmath2 } = -1 $ ] a single - star statistical error of 0.16 dex .      to characterize the monoceros mdf , we must first decompose the distribution of reliable [ fe / h ] estimates in each field into galactic components ( halo , disk ) and monoceros members . to estimate the expected background in both halo and disk stars , we simulate cmds for each pointing with both the besanon model @xcite and _ galfast _ , using the best fit galactic parameters of @xcite .",
    "all simulations included realistic photometry errors and were extinction free , for comparison to observed sdss cmds dereddened according to @xcite , henceforth sfd .",
    "we created a matched filter in target density for the stars with reliable [ fe / h ] in each field , then integrated against the observed , besanon and _ galfast _ star counts to determine the expected number of contaminating stars from the disk and halo . for each field ,",
    "overall cmd normalization constants close to unity were applied by requiring agreement between the total number of stars redder than @xmath90 and falling within the targeted range of @xmath91 values .",
    "this analysis suggests @xmath1565% of monoceros candidates with well - measured [ fe / h ] are true stream members . in no case",
    "do we expect any thin disk stars , as the monoceros targets have @xmath92 kpc .",
    "figure [ decomp ] shows a decomposition of the observed distributions of reliable [ fe / h ] for each field . in principle",
    ", there are nine free parameters : the normalization of monoceros , thick disk , and halo components , their median metallicities and their dispersions .",
    "the following subsections describe our assumptions for the thick disk and halo distributions , and procedure for fitting the monoceros component .      in each field , the thick disk normalization was fixed by the cmd analysis to be the average of the predictions from the _ galfast _ and besanon simulations . in fields north , south we fix the median metallicity to that of the thick disk targets in these fields , plus a small @xmath93 dex correction from @xcite equation ( a2 ) to account for the vertical disk metallicity gradient ( our thick disk targets are at lower @xmath94 than the more distant thick disk stars which contaminate the monoceros sample ) . for field north18 , in which we did not target any thick disk stars , the median [ fe / h ] used for field north was adopted . a @xmath95 dex intrinsic dispersion calculated from the kinematically selected thick disk stars in @xcite",

    "inspection of the cmd in field south also suggests multiple main sequence turnoffs aside from that of the disk .",
    "given these uncertainties in population modeling , the inferred gradient in monoceros median metallicity with @xmath3 ( @xmath132 dex from @xmath133 to @xmath134 ) appears not to be significant .    in two of three fields , the monoceros [ ca / fe ] dips below the galactic trend as [ fe / h ] increases from @xmath135 to @xmath136 ( see figure 3 ) . in fields north and south ,",
    "this [ ca / fe ] trend is qualitatively similar to the recently measured [ ti / fe ] trends of monoceros and sagittarius stream members @xcite . in field north18 , the observed monoceros trend appears to exactly match that of the milky way .",
    "however , the field north18 decomposition in figure [ decomp ] suggests the measured [ fe / h ] distribution cuts off more sharply than expected at high metallicity .",
    "if indeed [ fe / h ] has been systematically underestimated for the highest metallicity stars in this field , [ ca / fe ] would be artificially inflated .",
    "it should be noted that our monoceros sample plotted is a mixture of monoceros and disk stars , driving down the apparent contrast between the monoceros and milky way trends .",
    "in addition to the monoceros candidates , in fields north and south we measured [ fe / h ] for 30 and 60 thick disk stars respectively .",
    "these fields exhibit a strong stellar number density asymmetry , with the southern field showing an excess of more than 50% compared to its northern counterpart .",
    "the asymmetry is easily detected in the sdss data , is also detectable in pan - starrs1 @xmath137 survey data , and can not be accounted for by photometric errors or reddening uncertainties .",

    "( in preparation ) speculate it may be a signature of yet another , more nearby , stream , or otherwise a global disturbance ( a `` warp '' or a `` bend '' ) in the thick disk , of uncertain origin .",
    "figure [ decomp ] shows the measured distributions ; the median and dispersion of [ fe / h ] in field south are @xmath270.65 , 0.29 dex respectively , while for field north , the corresponding values are @xmath270.87 , 0.22 dex . the statistical scatter in our [ fe / h ] measurments @xmath150.05 dex per star has negligible effect on these values .",
    "the median @xmath94 for the north , south thick disk targets is respectively 1.60 kpc and 1.79 kpc , using the photometric parallax relation of i08 equations ( a6 ) and ( a7 ) . according to the gradient in disk metallicity from @xcite this corresponds to an expectation , given perfect disk symmetry , that south would have [ fe / h ] 0.01 dex _",
    "lower _ than north .",
    "the asymmetry is not simply reflecting different scale heights .",
    "although the adopted systematic error on our metallicities is nominally 0.13 dex , this represents an offset with respect to the true abundances ; our internal consistency should be much better , especially for these two thick disk samples which have very similar colors and s / n , as well as relatively strong fe features . reconciling",
    "the median metallicities of north / south thick disk sample would require that stellar parameters such as log@xmath34 and @xmath54 differ greatly between the two populations , which itself would require invoking disk asymmetry about the midplane .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test between the two measured [ fe / h ] distributions yields a consistency probablility of @xmath77@xmath138 , even excluding the added 0.01 dex contrast from the @xmath94 gradient in [ fe / h ] .    the dispersion in [ fe / h ] for field south is 0.22 dex , versus 0.29 dex for field north and 0.35 dex for the thick disk ( averaged over many directions ) according to @xcite . a disrupted dsph origin for the overdensity would naturally explain the lower [ fe / h ] dispersion in field south , but also incorrectly predict an [ fe / h ] lower than that of the northern disk for the southern stellar overdensity .",
    "thus , we have spectroscopically identified an asymmetry in the thick disk towards the galactic anticenter , at @xmath10 kpc and @xmath11 kpc , which we expect to be confirmed and characterized further via stellar counts analysis .      with @xmath33 photometry available , we can compute [ fe / h]@xmath139 from equation ( a1 ) of @xcite for the entire sample .",

    "furthermore , single - pointing samples of [ fe / h]@xmath139 and [ fe / h]@xmath145 are sensitive to local reddening in differing ways ( [ fe / h]@xmath145 is a function of @xmath35 reddening through @xmath53 ) . near [ fe / h ] = @xmath146 , using conventional reddening laws , overestimating @xmath147 leads to an underestimate of [ fe / h]@xmath139 , but to an overestimate of [ fe / h]@xmath145 for fixed absorption ew .",
    "any local ( degree scale ) error in @xmath147 drives our photometric and spectroscopic metallicities apart .",
    "nevertheless , we find a highly significant correlation between [ fe / h]@xmath139 and [ fe / h]@xmath145 .",
    "the correlation is strongest for the highest s / n spectra , corresponding to the brightest objects with least noisy @xmath148 photometry and best measured [ fe / h]@xmath145 .",
    "m13 , closely approximating a monometallic population , shows only a marginal correlation , in accordance with the expectation that the observed spread in [ fe / h ] values arises predominantly from random scatter in the photometric / spectroscopic measurements .",
    "figure [ comparison ] overplots the distributions of photometric / spectroscopic metallicities for each of our subsamples .",
    "in general , the median photometric and spectroscopic metallicities agree at the level of @xmath15@xmath130 dex , which can be reconciled by the estimated systematic uncertainties of 0.13 dex on [ fe / h]@xmath145 and 0.1 dex on [ fe / h]@xmath139 ( i08 ) .",
    "except for the m13 sample , the [ fe / h]@xmath145 distributions are narrower than their [ fe / h]@xmath139 counterparts , by a median of @xmath149 dex in dispersion .",
    "of course , much of the total dispersion is intrinsic .",
    "the superiority of m13 [ fe / h]@xmath139 owes to the targets being relatively bright ( @xmath150 ) , yielding good photometry , yet receiving only a single , short hectospec exposure .      as a byproduct of our abundance extraction procedure , we have heliocentric radial velocities in hand for our entire sample .",
    "typical statistical errors are 10 - 20 km  s@xmath52 , depending on s / n .",
