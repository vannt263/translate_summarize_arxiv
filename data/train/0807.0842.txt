    "one of the important prototypes of extended complex systems are nonlinear dynamical systems with spatially distributed degrees of freedom , or alternately spatial systems composed of large numbers of low dimensional nonlinear systems .",
    "the basic ingredients of such systems are : ( i ) creation of local chaos or local instability by a low dimensional mechanism and ( ii ) spatial transmission of energy and information by coupling connections of varying strengths and underlying topologies .",
    "the coupled map lattice ( cml ) is such a model , capturing the essential features of the nonlinear dynamics of extended systems @xcite .",
    "a very well - studied coupling form in cmls is nearest neighbour coupling .",
    "however some degree of randomness in spatial coupling can be closer to physical reality than strict nearest neighbour scenarios .",
    "in fact many systems of biological , technological and physical significance are better described by randomising some fraction of the regular links @xcite . here",
    "we focus on a ring of coupled chaotic maps whose coupling connections are dynamically rewired to random sites with probability @xmath0 , namely at any instance of time , with probability @xmath0 a regular link is switched to a random one @xcite .",
    "it has recently been found that such random coupling yields a spatiotemporal fixed point in a network of chaotic maps @xcite .",
    "that is , the strongly unstable fixed point of the local chaotic map is stabilized under increasing randomness in the coupling connections .",
    "thus interestingly , the inherent chaos present in the individual local units is suppressed by dynamically switched random links , giving rise to a global spatiotemporal fixed point attractor .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of _ parametric fluctuations _ on the synchronization properties of such networks .",
    "we consider different types of noise in the parameters : ( i ) spatial ( ii ) temporal and ( ii ) both spatial and temporal .",
    "keeping the local dynamics always fully chaotic , we focus on parameteric noise in the interaction parameters between the nodes in the network .",
    "in particular , we consider fluctuations in the fraction of random links @xmath0 in the system , and fluctuations in the coupling strength of the different links .",
    "that is , we study perturbations in both the geometry of the network connections , as reflected in noisy @xmath0 , as well as in the strength of the links .",
    "we consider a network of n coupled logistic maps .",
    "the sites are denoted by integers @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the size of the lattice . on each site",
    "is defined a continuous state variable denoted by @xmath3 , which corresponds to the physical variable of interest .",
    "the evolution of this lattice , under interactions with the nearest neighbours , is given by @xmath4 the strength of coupling is given by @xmath5 .",
    "the local on - site map is chosen to be the fully chaotic logistic map : @xmath6 with @xmath7 , as this map has widespread relevance as a prototype of low dimensional chaos .",
    "we consider the above system with its coupling connections rewired randomly with probability @xmath0 .",
    "namely , at every update we will connect a site with probability @xmath0 to randomly chosen sites , and with probability @xmath8 to nearest neighbours , as in eqn .  1 . that is , at every instant a fraction @xmath0 of randomly chosen nearest neighbour links are replaced by random links .",
    "the case of @xmath9 corresponds to the usual nearest neighbour interaction , while @xmath10 , corresponds to completely random coupling .",
    "this type of connectivity has been observed in a range of natural and human - engineered systems @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on the effect of fluctuations in the interaction parameters , i.e. noisy coupling strength @xmath5 , and fraction of random links @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "now , one can have four distinct scenarios ( denoting the relevant parameter as @xmath11 ) :    \\(i ) @xmath12    here the parameter is constant .",
    "we will denote this case of _ zero fluctuations _ by @xmath13 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the strength of the fluctuation in the parameter around mean value @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a zero - mean random number .",
    "so here the parameters are random in space but remain frozen in time , i.e. the parameters are spatially fluctuating but temporally invariant . in this case",
    "then , we have _ quenched disorder _ or a basic inhomogeneity of the network links .",
    "we will denote this case of _ spatial parametric fluctuations _ by @xmath18 .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath19 .",
    "again @xmath15 is the strength of the fluctuation in the parameter around mean value @xmath16 and @xmath20 is a zero - mean random number .",
    "so the fluctuation is a function of time but is site independent , i.e. the noise in the parameter is synchronous for all the elements , namely parameter @xmath11 is spatially uniform , though random in time .",
    "this kind of a situation may arise when the system is quite uniform intrinsically , but is subject to a _",
    "common _ perturbation , for instance from a common environmental influence , like say fluctuations in the ambient temperature .",
    "we will denote this case of _ temporal parametric fluctuations _ by @xmath21 .",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath22    here the fluctuations are a function of both time and space .",
    "such a scenario describes a situation where the system is both inhomogeneous in space and noisy in time .",
    "we will denote this case of _ spatiotemporal parametric fluctations _ by @xmath23 .",
    "here we consider @xmath24 to be uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "we have simulated the system , for all the above cases , with fluctuations in coupling strength ( i.e. @xmath26 ) and in the fraction of random links ( i.e. @xmath27 ) .",
    "the initial conditions of the individual elements were randomly chosen in the interval @xmath25 $ ] , and sufficient transients were removed before looking at the spatiotemporal profile of the network .",
    "fig .  1 displays the bifurcation diagrams of the system under different types of fluctuations in the fraction of random links @xmath0 , around a mean value of @xmath28 .",
    "it is evident that the spatiotemporal fixed point is quite robust under parametric fluctuations in general , as the range of the spatiotemporal fixed point in coupling parameter space does not reduce much under noisy @xmath0 .",
    "it can also clearly be seen that the bifurcation profile of the system under spatiotemporal fluctuations in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "1d ) is very similar to the system under constant @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "further we observe that quenched spatial fluctuations reduces the range of stability of the spatiotemporal fixed point most significantly ( fig .",
    "1b ) . on the other hand temporal fluctuations in @xmath0",
    "does not degrade the stability of the fixed point regime , and is most conducive to spatiotemporal regularity .",
    "in fact , interestingly the fixed point range obtained under temporal prametric fluctuations ( fig .",
    "1c ) is _ larger _ than that obtained from the constant case ( fig .",
    "qualitatively similar bifurcation diagrams with respect to @xmath0 were obtained under fluctuations in the coupling strength of the different links .    in order to quantify the above observation we calculate the average deviation of the system from a synchronized state , denoted by @xmath30 , and defined as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mean value of @xmath33 .",
    "the averages @xmath34 are over all sites @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and over long times @xmath37 .    figs .  2 - 3 show error @xmath30 with respect to coupling strength and the fraction of random links @xmath0 , under parametric fluctuations in @xmath0 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "it is clearly evident from both figures that temporal parametric fluctuations ( @xmath21 ) gives zero error for the largest range .",
    "spatiotemporal parametric fluctuations ( @xmath23 ) and the case where the parameter is kept constant at the mean value ( @xmath13 ) give completely similar trends . as observed earlier , the case of spatial paramteric fluctuations ( @xmath18 ) gives the smallest range , namely the spatiotemporal fixed point is least robust under quenched disorder .",

    "it is also evident that quenched disorder reduces the stable range the most , while the fixed point range is the largest for spatially uniform temporal fluctuations .",

    "in particular we study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the network with fluctuating rewiring probabilities and coupling strengths , with the fluctuations being ( a ) noisy in time , homogeneous in space , as applicable for intrinsically homogenoeus systems under common environmental noise ; ( ii ) noisy in space , and fixed in time , namely quenched disorder ; and ( iii ) noisy in both space and time ..    we find that static spatial inhomogeniety , namely quenched disorder , degrades spatiotemporal regularity most significantly .",
    "spatiotemporal fluctuations yield dynamical properties almost identical to networks with the parameters held constant at the mean values .",
