    "symbiotic stars are amongst the most variable sources in large photometric surveys ( e.g. mikoajewska 2001 ) owing to the rich variety of phenomena forged by the accretion of a red giant s high mass loss wind onto a white dwarf ( see mikoajewska 2012 for a recent review ) .",
    "extragalactic populations of symbiotic stars offer the opportunity to study these accretion driven processes at a known distance and therefore with known luminosities of the stellar components . while there are several ongoing and successful surveys for new galactic symbiotic stars ( e.g. corradi et al . 2008 , 2010 ; corradi 2012 ; miszalski , mikoajewska & udalski 2013 ; baella , pereira & miranda 2013 ; miszalski & mikoajewska 2014 ; rodrguez - flores et al . 2014 ) , there remains a longstanding scarcity of symbiotic stars in the magellanic clouds . in the small magellanic cloud ( smc )",
    "only seven symbiotic stars are known , lin  358 , n  60 and n  73 were found by walker ( 1983 ) , morgan ( 1992 ) discovered smc  1 , smc  2 and smc  3 , and the only one with warm dust surrounding a probable mira ( a dusty or d - type symbiotic , see e.g. whitelock 1987 ) was found by oliveira et al .",
    "similarly , in the lmc only eight are known ( belczyski et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have begun to investigate the use of large photometric databases to identify promising symbiotic stars , based on the presence of long periodic or outburst behaviour that can be typical of symbiotic stars .",
    "several recent studies have used large photometric surveys such as macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) and ogle ( e.g. udalski 2009 ) to study known symbiotic stars , as well as to assist in the identification of new symbiotic stars ( miszalski et al . 2009 ; gromadzki et al . 2009 ; lutz et al . 2010 ; kato , hachisu & mikoajewska 2013 ; miszalski , mikoajewska & udalski 2013 ; gromadzki , mikoajewska & soszyski 2013 ; miszalski & mikoajewska 2014 ; angeloni et al .",

    "we have obtained spectroscopy of several promising candidates from the ogle - iii smc long periodic variable ( lpv ) catalogue ( soszyski et al .",

    "we report on the discovery of a new smc symbiotic star , ogle - smc - lpv-00861 ( soszyski et al . 2011 ) , the first magellanic symbiotic star to show z  and outburst behaviour ( e.g. kenyon 1986 ) .",
    "it was highlighted as an object of high interest in figure 7 of soszyski et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and was pronounced by the authors as a rare example of an outburst in a red giant .",

    "coordinates from old photographic plates often have large uncertainties and since there is no visible source at the simbad position of lin  9 ( hambly et al .",
    "2001 ) , it seems likely that lin  9 coincides with ogle - smc - lpv-00861 .",
    "figure [ fig : dist ] displays the location of lin  9 relative to the other smc symbiotic stars . the spatial distribution of smc symbiotic stars highlights the challenging task remaining to identify the full population in the crowded central bar region .",
    "this has not yet been possible due to the lack of a high resolution modern h@xmath0 survey , but this will be available in the near future ( ripepi et al .",

    "a final calibration has not yet been applied to the ( post - outburst ) ogle - iv photometry ( hjd-2450000 @xmath9 5000 d ) , meaning the zero points of the photometry in this date range may be accurate to 0.10.2 mag .",
    "table [ tab : phot ] summarises characteristic magnitudes at quiescence and outburst we derived from the light curves .",
    "we have adopted an average @xmath10 mag at quiescence , averaging pre- and post - outburst measurements , because of the uncertain zero points .",
    "outburst amplitudes were , however , measured directly by comparing the maximum magnitudes against the pre - outburst ( hjd-245000@xmath13740 d ) average magnitudes .",
    "similarly , quiescent @xmath11 colours were calculated at this time .",
    "the whole outburst period lasts at least @xmath11200 days .",
    "there may be a tentative periodicity during quiescence of @xmath1500600 days , however a better sampled @xmath7-band light curve is necessary to investigate this further .",

    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     since case b conditions do not apply for s - type symbiotic stars , the balmer decrement can not be used to estimate the reddening .",
    "the reddening can be assumed to be less than the average for known smc symbiotic stars ( @xmath12 mag ; mrset et al .",
    "1996 ) and greater than the total galactic contribution @xmath13 mag ( schlafly et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this range can be refined further by taking the total hi column density of the smc at the position of lin  9 , namely @xmath14=510@xmath1510@xmath16 @xmath17 ( luks 1994 ) , corresponding to @xmath180.070.14 ( gordon et al .",
    "assuming lin  9 is located behind the hi cloud , we then obtain @xmath19 mag .",
    "furthermore , the 2mass @xmath20 colour of lin  9 is almost identical to lin  358 which has an ( uncertain ) estimate of @xmath21 or @xmath22 mag ( mrset et al .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath230.100.24 mag , i.e. @xmath24 mag or @xmath25 mag for lin  9 .",
    "the cool component of lin  9 bears close resemblance to the k - type giant of lin  358 ( mrset et al . 1996 ;",
    "[ fig : smc ] ) . in quiescence",
    "the @xmath26 mag colour of lin  9 corresponds to a k5 giant ( bessell & brett 1988 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the red giant can be estimated from its nir 2mass magnitudes ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 mag ) .",
    "the bolometric correction is estimated to be @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( bessell & wood 1984 ) . when combined with @xmath3212.25 mag",
    ", we find @xmath33=@xmath64.0 mag and @xmath34 @xmath4 .",
    "the effective temperature of the giant can be estimated using the colour - t@xmath35 relations for metal - poor giants calculated by kuinskas et al .",
    "assuming [ fe / h]=@xmath36 , the @xmath37 colour of lin  9 is then consistent with t@xmath35=3900 k. we then estimate the red giant radius @xmath38 @xmath39 assuming a distance of @xmath40 kpc ( hilditch et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is similar to those of other smc symbiotic star giants ( mrset et al .",
    "1996 ) .      during outburst we can estimate the magnitudes and @xmath11 colour of the hot component by subtracting the quiescent ( pre - outburst ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 magnitudes that represent the cool companion ( 16.2 and 14.4 mag , respectively ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 mag .",
    "the dereddened @xmath44 mag is consistent with an a or f - type giant or supergiant ( cousins 1980 ) , assuming that the optical bands are dominated by the a or f - type photosphere , rather than a nebular continuum which should much redder , @xmath45.1020 kk .",
    "if we assume the continuum during the optical maximum were dominated by nebular emission , then @xmath46 mag would require an enormous emission measure ( em ) of a few times @xmath47 @xmath48 , 12 orders of magnitude larger than nebular emission in any of the z and - type outbursts .",
    "for example , skopal et al .",
    "( 2009 ) estimated em=@xmath49 @xmath48 during the hot outburst of ag dra when the em was very high .",
    "moreover , to produce such an emision measure the hot component luminosity would have to exceed the eddington limit of a 1.0 @xmath50 white dwarf .",
    "] so , assuming that most of the hot component continuum emission is shifted to the optical ( a lower limit to @xmath51 if not ) , a distance of @xmath40 kpc ( hilditch et al .",
    "2005 ) , and that during outburst @xmath52 ( i.e. bc  0 for an a or f - type giant or supergiant , see e.g. straizys & kuriliene 1981 ) , we estimate @xmath53 mag which corresponds to @xmath54 @xmath4 .    at quiescence",
    "we make use of the fluxes in tab . [",
    "tab : lines ] to estimate the temperature and luminosity of the hot component .",
    "the minimum temperature is set by the maximum ionization potential ( ip ) observed in the spectrum , namely ip=114 ev , and the relation @xmath55 found by mrset & nussbaumer ( 1994 ) , to give @xmath56 kk .",
    "an upper limit for @xmath57 of 170 kk was derived from h@xmath58 , he  ii @xmath594686 and he  i @xmath595876 emission line ratios assuming case b recombination ( iijima 1981 ) .",
    "we estimate the luminosity of the hot component to be @xmath5 l@xmath60 using equation 8 of kenyon et al .",
    "similarly , equations 6 and 7 of mikoajewska et al .",
    "( 1997 ) give @xmath61 @xmath4 and @xmath62 @xmath4 .",
    "several other symbiotic stars in mikoajewska et al .",
    "( 1997 ) were found to have similar luminosities for their hot components .",
    "all these estimates assume blackbody spectrum for the hot component , @xmath63 kpc ( hilditch et al .",
    "2005 ) , case b recombination for the emission lines , and are accurate to only a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the outburst amplitudes observed in lin  9 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : phot ] ) are comparable to typical amplitudes of the optical outbursts in classical z  and - type symbiotic stars ( e.g figure 1.2 of kenyon 1986 ; see also figure 4 of kenyon et al .",
    "the outburst behaviour observed in symbiotic stars , based on their activity , can either occur in ordinary or classical symbiotic stars ( e.g. z  and , ci  cyg , ax  per , and ag  dra as typical examples ) , or in symbiotic novae that are essentially thermonuclear novae .",
    "many of these classical systems , including z  and ( the prototype ) , ci  cyg , and ax  per , show occasional 13 mag optical eruptions with timescales from months to years . during this time",
    "the hot component maintains roughly constant luminosity ( within a factor of a few ) , whereas its effective temperature decreases to @xmath110@xmath64 k. the mechanism of this activity has been only recently explained by unstable disc - accretion onto hydrogen - shell burning white dwarf ( mikoajewska 2003 ; sokoloski et al .",
    "there still remains , however , no quantitative model of the phenomenon .",
    "another argument in favour of the z  and - type outburst is the lack of a rich nebular spectrum after the optical maximum , especially one containing forbidden lines .",
    "such a spectrum is present in all known syne once they decline from their optical maximum .",
    "although galactic z  and - type systems also show some forbidden lines ( e.g. [ o  iii ] , [ ne  iii ] , [ fe  vii ] ) , these lines are never as strong as in syne , and they crucially do not show the lower density lines ( e.g. [ o  ii ] , [ s  ii ] , [ n  ii ] ; see e.g. ci  cyg - kenyon et al . 1991 ; ag  dra - mikoajewska et al .",
    "1995 ; z  and - mikoajewska & kenyon 1996 ) .",
    "this should also hold for lin  9 in the low metallicity environment of the smc , since similarly rich nebular spectra are also observed in classical novae in the smc ( e.g. nova smc 2001 , mason et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the lin  9 spectrum is very similar to the quiescent optical spectrum of ag  dra ( mikoajewska et al .",
    "1995 ; munari et al .",
    "2009 ) , the galactic halo z  and - type symbiotic with a very low metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath61.3 dex ( smith et al .",
    "in particular , in both lin  9 and ag  dra , there are no forbidden emission lines in the optical spectra , except for relatively faint auroral [ oiii ] @xmath594363 and [ ne  iii ] @xmath593869 lines present in some spectra of ag  dra ( mikoajewska et al .",
    "significantly , there are no high ionization [ fe  vii ] @xmath656089 , 5721 emission lines that usually accompany the raman scattered o  vi lines ( schmid 1989 ) in spectra of galactic symbiotic stars ( allen 1984 ; mikoajewska , acker & stenholm 1997 ; munari & zwitter 2002 ; miszalski & mikoajewska 2014 ) .",
    "the lack of [ fe  vii ] and other metallic lines in ag  dra , as well as some other smc symbiotic systems ( e.g. allen 1984 ; munari & zwitter 2002 ) , may be symptomatic of their low metallicity",
    ". this may also be the case for the carbon - rich galactic symbiotic 2mass j16003761@xmath64835228 which displays coronal [ fe  x ] @xmath596735 emission , but not [ fe  vii ] emission ( miszalski & mikoajewska 2014 ) .",
    "we have discovered a new smc symbiotic star , lin  9 , with salt rss spectroscopy of a remarkable candidate first highlighted by soszyski et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for its unusual outbursts in the ogle light curve .",
    "we have proven that the outburst event can not be ascribed to a symbiotic nova , but instead must be a z  and outburst",
    ". further study of this unique z  and magellanic symbiotic star at a known distance will help in the development of physical models for the still poorly understood z  and outburst mechanism .",
    "the discovery of lin  9 brings the total number of symbiotic stars known in the smc to eight and demonstrates that spectroscopic follow - up of candidates that exhibit long term periodic behaviour or outbursts can indeed help alleviate the current paucity of identified magellanic symbiotic stars in the near future .",
