    "supermassive black holes ( bhs ) are ubiquitous in the centre of massive galaxies . for most of the time they are in a quiescent state , but sometimes they can accrete matter from the surroundings and power an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; ho 2008 ) . stars orbiting around the central bh of a galaxy interact with each other , increasing the probability for one of them to be scattered on a low angular momentum orbit ( alexander 2012 ) . a tidal disruption event ( tde ) could thus occur contributing to the bh flaring on time - scales of months or years ( e.g. rees 1988 ; phinney 1989 ) . for solar mass stars",
    ", this occurs when the ( non - spinning ) bh mass is less than about @xmath2 . for heavier bhs ,",
    "these stars cross the horizon and are fully swallowed before being tidally disrupted ( macleod , ramirez - ruiz & guillochon 2012 ) . as a consequence , tdes contribute to the detection of otherwise quiescent bhs in inactive ( or weakly active ) galaxies in a mass interval somewhat complementary to that probed in surveys of bright agns and qsos ( vestergaard & osmer 2009 ) .",
    "the total tidal disruption of a single star of mass @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 moving on a parabolic orbit around the central bh of a galaxy of mass @xmath5 occurs when its pericentre radius @xmath6 is less than about the so - called bh tidal radius @xmath7 corresponding to the distance where the bh tidal force overcomes the star self - gravity at its surface ( hills 1975 ; frank & rees 1976 ) . on the contrary",
    ", if @xmath8 , the star undergoes less distortion and suffers only partial disruption .",
    "the value of the impact parameter @xmath9 defines how deep the disruption is ( guillochon & ramirez - ruiz 2013 , 2015a ) .",
    "roughly , only about half of the produced stellar debris remains bound to the bh and accretes on to it , powering the emission of a characteristic flare ( e.g. rees 1988 ; phinney 1989 ) . in the regime of partial tdes , the star , if on a bound orbit , could transfer a fraction of its mass to the bh every time it passes through the pericentre of its orbit , thus powering one flare for every orbital period and maybe ` spoon - feeding ' the quiescent luminosity of weakly active galaxies ( macleod et al .",

    "however , most of the stars in the field are in binaries ( duquennoy & mayor 1991b ; fischer & marcy 1992 ) ; hence , it is worth also studying close encounters between binaries and galactic central bhs which can lead to the disruption of both the binary members .",
    "the topic was first discussed by mandel & levin ( 2015 ) , suggesting that in a binary - bh encounter under certain conditions both binary components may undergo tidal disruption in sequence immediately after the tidal binary break - up .",
    "a double - peaked flare is expected to occur , signature of such a peculiar event .    in this paper , we present for the first time the results of a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations performed using the gadget2 code ( springel 2005 ; the code can be freely downloaded from http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/ ) in the aim at studying the physics of double tidal disruptions and at characterizing the expected light curves . as a first exploratory study , we consider parabolic encounters of binaries with galactic central bhs in the newtonian regime , in order to explore which are the most favourable conditions for the occurrence of double - peaked flares . in particular , we address the following questions .",
    "are all simulated encounters leading to double - peaked light curves or are there cases of single - peaked light curves ?",
    "how can we disentangle the different outcomes ?",
    "how prominent are the double peaks ?",

    "not all encounters can lead to double tdes , and in section 4 we introduce a classification of the obtained outcomes . in section 5 , we show the results of a selected sample of high - resolution simulations and the light curves directly inferred from them .",
    "section 6 sums up results and conclusions .",
    "we are here interested in identifying the set conditions for the sequential tidal disruption of binary stars around galactic central bhs , following mandel & levin ( 2015 ) .",
    "tidal break - up of a binary on a parabolic orbit around a bh occurs if the binary cm around the bh enters a sphere of radius @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the binary semimajor axis and total mass ( miller et al .",
    "2005 ; sesana , madau & haardt 2009 ) .",
    "we notice that binary break - up comes before single - star tidal disruptions , given that @xmath16 ( see equations [ eq1 ] and [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "tidal break - up occurs when the specific angular momentum ( in modulus ) of the binary cm at pericentre becomes less than @xmath17 orbits which allow tidal binary break - up are called loss cone orbits ( merritt 2013 ) . a binary on a loss cone orbit",
    "is broken up after one pericentre passage , over a time - scale @xmath18 , corresponding to the orbital period of a binary on a circular orbit at the same distance from the bh .",
    "both stars of a binary can undergo a sequential tidal disruption immediately after the tidal binary break - up only if the specific angular momentum of the binary cm around the bh at the closest approach , defined as @xmath19 instantly changes from being greater than @xmath20 to becoming less than @xmath21 , where @xmath22 in this way , the binary enters intact the region of single - star tdes .",
    "this occurs if the binary experiences a large enough change @xmath23 , at least of the order of @xmath24 , in the specific circular angular momentum @xmath25 , over a time - scale @xmath26 .",
    "interactions with surrounding stars and/or massive perturbers can promote such a change ( perets , hopman & alexander 2007 ; alexander 2012 ) .",
    "we consider empty the portion of the loss cone , in phase space , corresponding to binaries that break up before entering the region of single - star tdes , and full the portion of the loss cone corresponding to binaries which can enter intact the region of single - star tdes ( merritt 2013 ) .    in order to evaluate the distribution of the binary parameters associated with double disruptions ,",
    "it is useful to determine @xmath27 , defined as the distance of the binary from the bh before experiencing the change @xmath23 in @xmath28 , separating the two regimes . considering two - body relaxation over a time - scale @xmath29 $ ] ( spitzer & hart 1971 ) as the main mechanism which drives changes in angular momentum",
    ", it is known that the change in specific circular angular momentum @xmath30 over a period @xmath26 is of the order of @xmath31 ( merritt 2013 ) .",
    "thus , the critical condition @xmath32 enables us to infer @xmath27 . if the binary is orbiting inside a bahcall - wolf density profile @xmath33 ( bahcall & wolf 1976 ) , @xmath27 reads @xmath34^{4/9 } \\bigl(\\frac{m_{\\rm bh}}{m_{\\rm * } } \\bigr)^{28/27 } a_{\\rm bin}^{4/9}\\\\ \\sim10^{7 } \\rm r_{\\rm \\odot } \\bigl(\\frac{1.3\\times 10 ^ 6 \\rm pc^{-3}}{\\it n_{\\rm 0}}\\bigr)^{4/9 } \\bigl(\\frac{0.3 \\rm pc}{\\it r_{\\rm 0}}\\bigr)^{7/9 } \\bigl(\\frac{10}{\\ln \\lambda}\\bigr)^{4/9 } \\\\",

    "we note that @xmath27 is comparable to the radius of gravitational influence of a bh @xmath37 ( peebles 1972 ; merritt 2000 ) .",
    "a binary carries internal degrees of freedom , and in particular the relative velocity of the two binary components , @xmath38 , is clearly smaller than the orbital velocity of the binary cm relative to the bh , @xmath39 .",
    "the velocity of the two stars relative to the centre of mass of the stellar binary gives then a small contribution to the specific angular momentum of each binary star relative to the bh at @xmath40 that approximately is @xmath41 sequential disruptions are expected to be favoured when @xmath42 is small .",
    "indeed , the smaller @xmath42 is , the more each binary component has an orbit around the bh similar to the one of the binary cm , i.e. a similar pericentre passage .",
    "thus , we require @xmath43 where we approximated @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 we need @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the second condition for double tdes , which joins the condition on @xmath23 , is the involvement of close binaries .",
    "furthermore , very close binaries are required in order to avoid their evaporation due to interactions with field stars before tidal binary break - up ( merritt 2013 ) .    in the full loss cone regime",
    ", the parameter space of binaries that can undergo double tdes can be inferred from the rate of binary entrance in the region of stellar tdes per unit of @xmath49 and @xmath14 as found in mandel & levin ( 2015 ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the probability for a binary to enter directly the single tde region ( merritt 2013 ) and @xmath52^{-1 } a_{\\rm bin}^{-1}$ ] is the distribution function for @xmath14 given in @xmath53 ( 1924 ) , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the maximum and the minimum semimajor axes of stellar binaries in a generic galactic field .",
    "integration of equation [ eq10 ] over @xmath49 , between @xmath27 and @xmath56 , enables us to evaluate the number of binaries that may undergo sequential tidal disruption of their components per unit of time and unit of @xmath14 .",

    "the resulting rate is @xmath59^{-1 }   r_{\\rm * } p_{\\rm bin}^{-47/27}.\\ ] ] we use this scaling to extract the initial conditions of our sph simulations .",
    "thus , in the case of solar mass stars ( i.e. @xmath60 ) , the contribution of double tdes to all tdes could be approximately estimated by integrating equation [ eqrate ] over @xmath14 between @xmath61 and @xmath62 and dividing it by the corresponding integral obtained after integration over @xmath49 of equation [ eq10 ] , with @xmath63 in place of @xmath14 ( also in equation [ eq9 ] ) . to @xmath14 in equation [ eq10 ] , @xmath64 .",
    "] this ratio scales as @xmath65^{-1}$ ] , which gives a maximum of @xmath66 per cent assuming @xmath67 and @xmath68 and considering that the multiplicity of stars is single : double @xmath69 50:50 for 100 solar - type stars",
    "( duquennoy & mayor 1991b ) , disregarding uncertainties in the number of very close binaries .",
    "the definition of the parameter space of binaries that may be double tidally disrupted is fundamental to guide us to sensibly define the initial conditions of a small number of representative low - resolution simulations aimed at checking different outcomes from different initial parameters , and particularly from different pericentre radii of the binary cm .",
    "the simulations in this paper are performed using the treesph code gadget2 ( springel 2005 ) . in sph codes , a star is represented by a set of gas particles .",
    "each particle is characterized by a spatial distance , the smoothing length , over which its properties are ` smoothed ' by its kernel function , i.e. evaluated by summing the properties of particles in the range of the kernel according to the kernel itself ( price 2005 ) . in particular , in gadget2",
    "the smoothing length of each particle is defined so that its kernel volume contains a constant mass , and is allowed to vary with time , thus adapting to the local conditions .",
    "the kernel adopted here is the one used most commonly and is based on cubic splines ( monaghan & lattanzio 1985 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "gravitational interactions between particles are computed through a hierarchical oct - tree algorithm , which significantly reduces the number of pair interactions needed to be computed . the definition of a gravitational softening length @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the total number of particles , prevents particle overlapping .",
    "gadget2 enables us to follow the temporal evolution of single particle properties and to infer from them tde light curves ( see section [ subsection ] ) .",
    "we run 14 low - resolution simulations of parabolic encounters between equal - mass binaries and bhs ( le runs ) to test the nature of the outcomes for different initial conditions , varying binary parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the stellar binaries are first evolved in isolation for several dynamical times to ensure their stability .",
    "the bh force is implemented in the code analytically , as a newtonian potential , and particles which fall below the innermost stable circular orbit radius @xmath72 are excised from simulations .",
    "we consider equal solar mass stars modelled as polytropes of index 5/3 and we sample each of them with @xmath73 particles .",
    "some correspondent high - resolution simulations are presented in section [ subsection ] .",
    "the initial binary internal orbital periods @xmath58 and semimajor axes @xmath14 are extracted according to the distributions described in section [ basics ] . based on the work of duquennoy & mayor ( 1991a ) , we consider binaries with @xmath74d ( @xmath75 ) @xmath76d ( @xmath77 ) to be circular , binaries with @xmath78d @xmath79d ( @xmath80 ) to have internal eccentricities distributed according to a gaussian of mean 0.3 and standard deviation 0.15 and binaries with @xmath81d @xmath82yr ( @xmath83 ) to have internal eccentricities which follow a thermal distribution @xmath84 . in order to avoid immediate collisions between the binary components , the initial pericentre radius of the internal binaries ( i.e. @xmath85 )",
