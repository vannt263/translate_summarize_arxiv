    "the purpose of this article is to give a quite detailed account of the theory of multiplicity - free representations based on a non - standard method ( _ visible actions _ on complex manifolds ) through its application to branching problems .",
    "more precisely , we address the question of restricting irreducible highest weight representations @xmath1 of reductive lie groups @xmath2 with respect to symmetric pairs @xmath3 . then , our main goal is to give a simple and sufficient condition on the triple @xmath4 such that the restriction @xmath5 is multiplicity - free .",
    "we shall see that our method works in a uniform way for both infinite and finite dimensional representations , for both classical and exceptional cases , and for both continuous and discrete spectra .",
    "this article is an outgrowth of the manuscript @xcite which i did not publish , but which has been circulated as a preprint .",
    "from then onwards , we have extended the theory , in particular , to the following three directions : 1)the generalization of our main machinery ( theorem  [ thm:2.2 ] ) to the vector bundle case ( @xcite ) , 2)the theory of   on complex manifolds ( @xcite ) , 3)`multiplicity - free geometry ' for coadjoint orbits ( @xcite ) .",
    "we refer the reader to our paper @xcite for a precise statement of the general results and an exposition of the related topics that have recently developed .    in this article , we confine ourselves to the line bundle case . on the one hand , this is sufficiently general to produce many interesting consequences , some of which are new and some others may be regarded as prototypes of various multiplicity - free branching theorems ( e.g.   @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the line bundle case is sufficiently simple , so that we can illustrate the essence of our main ideas without going into technical details .",
    "thus , keeping the spirit of @xcite , we have included here the proof of our method ( theorem  [ thm:2.2 ] ) , its applications to multiplicity - free theorems ( theorems  [ thm : a][thm : f ] ) , and the explicit formulae ( theorems  [ thm : ghks ] , [ thm : tensordeco ] , and [ thm : upqupq ] ) , except that we referred to another paper @xcite for the proof of some algebraic lemmas on the triple of involutions of lie algebras ( lemmas  [ lem:5.1 ] and [ lem:7.5 ] ) .",
    "let us begin by recalling the concept of the multiplicity - free decomposition of a unitary representation .",
    "suppose @xmath6 is a lie group of type i in the sense of von neumann algebras .",
    "any reductive lie group is of type i as well as any algebraic group .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the unitary dual of @xmath6 , that is , the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of @xmath6 .",
    "the unitary dual @xmath7 is endowed with the fell topology .",
    "suppose that @xmath8 is a unitary representation of @xmath6 defined on a ( second countable ) hilbert space @xmath9 . by a theorem of mautner , @xmath1 is decomposed uniquely into irreducible unitary representations of @xmath6 in terms of the direct integral of hilbert spaces : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a borel measure on @xmath7 , and the multiplicity function @xmath12 is uniquely defined almost everywhere with respect to the measure @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the ring of continuous operators on @xmath9 , and @xmath15 the subring of @xmath6-intertwining operators , that is , the commutant of @xmath16 in @xmath14",
    ".    [ def:1.2 ] we say that the unitary representation @xmath8 is _ multiplicity - free _ if the ring @xmath15 is commutative .    it is not difficult to see that this definition is equivalent to the following property : @xmath17 by schur s lemma for unitary representations . in particular , it implies that any irreducible unitary representation @xmath18 of @xmath6 occurs at most once as a subrepresentation of @xmath1 .      with regard to the question of finding irreducible decompositions of unitary representations ,",
    "there are two fundamental settings : one is the induced representation from smaller groups ( e.g. harmonic analysis on homogeneous spaces ) , and the other is the restriction from larger groups ( e.g. tensor product representations ) .    to be more rigorous ,",
    "suppose @xmath2 is a lie group , and @xmath6 is a closed subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2-irreducible decomposition of the induced representation @xmath19-@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is called the _ plancherel formula _ , while the @xmath6-irreducible decomposition of the restriction @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is referred to as the _ branching law_.",
    "this subsection examines multiplicities in the irreducible decomposition of the induction and the restriction for reductive symmetric pairs @xmath3 ( see subsection  [ subsec:3.1 ] for definition ) .",
    "let us start with the induced representation .",
    "van den ban @xcite proved that the multiplicity in the plancherel formula for @xmath19-@xmath20 is finite as far as @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , this is the case if @xmath25 is the trivial representation @xmath26 . over the past several decades",
    ", the induced representation @xmath19-@xmath27 has developed its own identity ( harmonic analysis on reductive symmetric spaces @xmath28 ) as a rich and meaningful part of mathematics .",
    "in contrast , the multiplicities of the branching law of the restriction @xmath5 ( @xmath23 ) are usually infinite .",
    "for instance , we saw in @xcite that this is the case if @xmath29 where @xmath30 , for any tempered representation @xmath1 of @xmath2 . in this article , we illuminate by example  [ ex : finite infinite ] this wild behavior . in light of such a wild phenomenon of branching laws for reductive symmetric pairs",
    "@xmath3 with @xmath6 non - compact , we proposed in @xcite to seek for a ` nice ' class of the triple @xmath31 in which a systematic study of the restriction @xmath5 could be launched .",
    "finiteness of multiplicities is a natural requirement for this program . by also imposing discrete decomposability on the restriction @xmath5",
    ", we established the general theory for _ admissible restriction _ in @xcite and found that there exist fairly rich triples @xmath31 that enjoy this nice property .",
    "it is noteworthy that new interesting directions of research in the framework of admissible restrictions have been recently developed by m. duflo , d. gross , j .- s .",

    "loke , t. oda , p. pandi , g. savin , b. speh , j. vargas , d. vogan , and n. wallach ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "multiplicity - freeness is another ideal situation , in which we may expect an especially simple and detailed study of the branching law of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we aim for principles that lead us to abundant family of multiplicity - free cases . among them , a well - known one is the dual pair correspondence , which has given fruitful examples in infinite dimensional theory in the following setting :    @xmath2 is the metaplectic group , and @xmath1 is the weil representation .",
    "@xmath32 forms a dual pair , that is , @xmath33 is the commutant of @xmath34 in @xmath2 , and vice versa .",
    "this paper uses a new principle that generates multiplicity - free representations .",
    "the general theory discussed in section  [ sec:2 ] brings us to uniformly bounded multiplicity theorems ( theorems  [ thm : b ] and [ thm : d ] ) and multiplicity - free theorems ( theorems  [ thm : a ] , [ thm : c ] , [ thm : e ] and [ thm : f ] ) in the following setting :    @xmath1 is a unitary highest weight representation of @xmath2 ( see subsection  [ subsec:1.4 ] ) ,    @xmath3 is a symmetric pair ( see subsection  [ subsec:1.5 ] )",
    ".    we note that we allow the case where continuous spectra occur in the branching law , and consequently , irreducible summands are not always highest weight representations .",
    "we remark that our bounded multiplicity theorems for the restriction @xmath5 ( @xmath1 : highest weight module ) may be regarded as the counterpart of the bounded multiplicity theorem for the induction @xmath19-@xmath20 ( @xmath25 : finite dimensional representation ) due to van den ban .",
