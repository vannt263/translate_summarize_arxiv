    "to completely describe the lattice of subalgebras @xmath2 of a finite algebra @xmath0 is a difficult task .",
    "moreover , it is not obvious how to store the information about @xmath2 efficiently , as the cardinality and complexity of @xmath2 is typically much larger than that of @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , sometimes there is a procedure that allows us to calculate the join @xmath3 and meet @xmath4 for every @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , it is easy to find the join and meet in any boolean algebra @xmath0 , although @xmath7 grows exponentially in @xmath8 .",
    "it is this ability to calculate @xmath9 and @xmath10 that is often understood as a complete description of @xmath2 .",
    "most of the time we are not so lucky , though , and there is no apparent way to find joins and meets .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be far from both @xmath5 and @xmath11 in the lattice @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore more convenient to have access to a procedure that gives a complete _ local _ description of @xmath2 . assuming that it is possible to find all maximal subalgebras of @xmath12 and all subalgebras @xmath13 in which @xmath5 is maximal , the lattice @xmath2 can be built up inductively .",
    "we will refer to all subalgebras immediately above and immediately below @xmath5 in @xmath2 as _ neighbors _ of @xmath5 , and we denote the set they form by @xmath14 .    in this context , it is worth paying attention to the automorphism group @xmath1 and its natural action on @xmath0 , since the neighborhoods of @xmath5 and @xmath11 will be `` the same '' for @xmath5 , @xmath6 belonging to the same orbit of transitivity of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the lattice @xmath2 can be fully described as long as we find    1 .",

    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , to introduce a general tool ",
    "hasse constants  that is of some help in all three tasks @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath15 . secondly , to use hasse constants to describe the subloop lattice of the smallest nonassociative simple moufang loop @xmath18 .",
    "the investigation of @xmath19 occupies most of this paper , and is inevitably of rather detailed nature .",
    "we maintain that the power of hasse constants is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that @xmath19 was not known before ( see acknowledgement ) , especially given the importance of @xmath18 for the real octonions .",
    "although considerable invention will be required in each particular case , we believe that hasse constants will help to keep track in investigation of any subalgebra lattice .    a word about the notation : we write @xmath20 for the cyclic group of order @xmath21 , @xmath22 for the dihedral group of order @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for the elementary abelian @xmath25-group of order @xmath26 . a subalgebra generated by the set @xmath27",

    "let @xmath5 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 be finite ( universal ) algebras , @xmath12 . for @xmath29 , let @xmath30 denote the orbit of @xmath31 under the natural action of @xmath1 on the set of subalgebras of @xmath0 isomorphic to @xmath31 .",
    "we will speak of the subalgebras of @xmath0 isomorphic to @xmath31 as _ copies _ of @xmath31 in @xmath0 . define @xmath32 furthermore , when @xmath13 , let @xmath33 in words , @xmath34 counts the number of copies of @xmath11 in @xmath0 , @xmath35 counts the number of copies of @xmath11 in @xmath0 containing @xmath5 , and @xmath36 counts the number of copies of @xmath11 in @xmath0 containing @xmath5 and in the same orbit as @xmath11 .    yet",
    "another description of these constants is perhaps the most appealing . for @xmath13 , the constant @xmath34 counts the number of edges connecting @xmath0 to a copy of @xmath11 in the complete hasse diagram of @xmath2 .",
