    "<S> fano resonances and bound states with energy in the continuum are ubiquitous phenomena in different areas of physics . </S>",
    "<S> observations , however , have been limited so far to single - particle processes . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally investigate the multi - particle case and observe fano interference in a non - interacting two - particle fano - anderson model by considering propagation of two - photon states in engineered photonic lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of the particles , either bosonic or fermionic , strongly affects the decay process . remarkably , we find that the fano resonance , when two discrete levels are coupled to a continuum , is suppressed in the fermionic case .    </S>",
    "<S> decay of excited states has been a topic of great interest since the early times of quantum mechanics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an excited state is usually modelled by a breit - wigner resonance , which is the universal hallmark of unstable states . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum interference , arising from wave function superposition , can lead to different manifestations of resonant behavior for unstable states when multiple paths are possible . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of the fano resonance @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fano s model@xcite is a landmark in modern physics . </S>",
    "<S> firstly developed to explain the behaviour of electrons scattered by excited atoms @xcite , it was later adopted to explain phenomena in a number of different physical systems @xcite , such as ultracold gases and bose - einstein condensates ( where the fano resonance is usually referred to as feshbach resonance @xcite ) , semiconductors , quantum dots and mesoscopic systems @xcite , and plasmonic nanostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fano interference is observed when different decay channels interfere , giving rise to broadening and asymmetric deformations of natural line shapes . in general , the destructive interference between different decay channels is associated to the formation of bound states in the continuum @xcite , which inhibit the complete decay of the excited state . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between bound states in the continuum and fano / feshbach resonances has been highlighted in several works ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies on fano resonances @xcite , quantum decay processes @xcite and bound states in the continuum @xcite have focused up to now on single - particle dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , recent works @xcite showed that particle statistics and contact interactions can deeply modify the decay dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> fermions and bosons may show very different decay behaviour , in particular in many cases fermions tend to decay faster @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no experimental observation of this phenomenon has been reported yet .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , experimentally , the decay process of two non - interacting particles to a common continuum , by probing an engineered photonic lattice with two - photon states . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice , consisting of a three - dimensional array of coupled optical waveguides , is fabricated in a glass substrate by femtosecond laser micromachining @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the bosonic dynamics is naturally observed for identically polarised photons , an antisymmetric polarisation - entangled state of the two photons is used to simulate the fermionic behavior @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on systems described by the fano - anderson @xcite or friedrichs - lee hamiltonian @xcite , which is a paradigmatic model to study quantum mechanical decay , fano interference phenomena and bound states in the continuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest case is provided by two discrete states coupled to a common tight - binding continuum of modes , i.e. a quantum wire @xcite . in detail </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a system composed of two sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively with energy @xmath2 and @xmath3 , side - coupled with hopping rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , to a common semi - infinite chain of coupled sites ( a quantum wire ) , each with energy @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : model]a - b ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , states @xmath0 and @xmath1 can decay by tunnelling to the common continuum given by the tight - binding lattice band of the quantum wire . the energy of the band spans the interval @xmath7 , being @xmath8 the hopping rate between two adjacent sites of the wire . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be considered embedded into the continuum , i.e. @xmath9 , and the coupling of the sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the continuum will be assumed as weak , i.e. @xmath10 .    in our experiment , the sites correspond to optical modes of different waveguides , which interact through their evanescent field . </S>",
    "<S> the system is thus formed by two waveguides coupled to a linear waveguide array , according to the geometry of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model]c . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 depend on the distance between the waveguides and can be tailored by carefully dimensioning the structure . </S>",
    "<S> the energies @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath11 correspond to the propagation constants of the waveguides themselves and can be tuned by varying the refractive index change in the different waveguides ( for our direct laser writing process , this is achieved by tailoring the writing speed ) . in this photonic implementation </S>",
    "<S> , the temporal dynamics of the system is mapped onto the propagation distance @xmath12 .         for different propagation lengths and energy detuning </S>",
    "<S> are reported for the case of ( a ) bosonic or ( b ) fermionic particles , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> propagation and energy coordinates are normalized with respect to @xmath8 , and the parameters used for the simulations are @xmath13 and @xmath14.,width=302 ]    the evolution of the particle - creation operators @xmath15 for the various modes is governed by the coupled - mode equations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to the modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while @xmath15 with @xmath19 refer to the modes of the linear array . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between the semi - infinite lattice model , described by the operator equations , and the fano - anderson model can be readily established by an operator transformation from the wannier to the bloch basis representation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting property of this system is the existence of one bound state in the continuum when @xmath20 . in fact , it is easy to observe that in this case the operator @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 , i.e. population of the dressed state described by @xmath23 does not decay . in the bloch basis of operators , the bound state can be interpreted as a result of a destructive fano interference between different decay channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to fractional decay when a single particle ( photon ) is placed in either site ( waveguide ) @xmath0 or @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we are studying here the two - particles case , considering an initial state @xmath24 of the system excited with one photon in @xmath0 and one photon in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> quantum decay is described by the survival probability : @xmath25 which is the probability that , at a propagation distance @xmath12 , both particles are still in the initial state and none has decayed into the continuum . from an experimental point of view , @xmath26 corresponds to the probability of coincidence detection of two photons in output modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .        by exciting the system with two identically polarised photons the natural bosonic behaviour is observed . on the contrary , if the system is excited with an antisymmetric polarisation - entangled two - photon state , @xmath27 has the same expression as if we were injecting two identical particles with fermionic statistics , i.e. the operators @xmath15 satisfy fermionic commutation rules ( see e.g. refs . and the specific discussion in the supplemental material ) . figure [ fig : simulation]a - b show numerical simulations of survival probability @xmath27 for a system described by , in normalized coordinates , for initial two - particle states either bosonic or fermionic . </S>",
    "<S> a striking difference between the bosonic and fermionic behaviour is evident , as will be experimentally demonstrated in the following .    as a first experiment , we concentrate on the investigation of the quantum decay in the case @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we have fabricated several structures as that reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model]c , yielding @xmath28  mm@xmath29 , @xmath30  mm@xmath29 , @xmath31  mm@xmath29 , and different lengths @xmath12 of the array . in our realization </S>",
    "<S> the linear array is composed of 25 waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> details on the fabrication process by femtosecond laser direct writing are given in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> each structure allows us to photograph the evolution at a specific propagation distance @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the system is first characterized by launching laser light separately in waveguides @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and imaging the output facet with a cmos camera . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of light remaining in the launch waveguides is measured . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to investigating the single - particle behaviour , when the particle is initially on mode @xmath0 or @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> survival probability @xmath32 for two classical , distinguishable particles is easily calculated from the product of two single - particle experimental distributions ( since the two particles are uncorrelated ) .    to experimentally characterize the system behaviour for two correlated particles , two photons at 810  nm wavelength , generated by a spontaneous parametric down - conversion source , </S>",
    "<S> are coupled to single - mode optical fibres and injected simultaneously in waveguides @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> output light from the same waveguides is collected by an objective , coupled to multimode fibres and detected by single - photon avalanche photodiodes ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : setup]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> coincidence - detection counts , in equal temporal gates , are performed for different input states : indistinguishable vertically polarised photons , polarisation - entangled photons in antisymmetric state and distinguishable photons ( the latter being generated by introducing , for each of the previous states , a temporal delay for one of the photons ) . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions correspond to identical bosons , identical fermions and distinguishable particles . </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability for identical bosons @xmath33 and fermions @xmath34 is then retrieved from experimental measurements as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the coincidence counts for the @xmath37 state , @xmath38 the corresponding counts when one photon is delayed , @xmath39 are the coincidence counts for the entangled @xmath40 state , @xmath41 the corresponding counts when one photon is delayed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : setup]b reports the experimentally characterized survival probabilities for the different @xmath12 and different input states , compared to numerical simulations for the same system . while @xmath33 shows a fractional decay owing to the existence of a bound state , @xmath34 shows a full decay . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental points for fermions do not reach exactly zero due to imperfections in preparing the entangled state and slight polarisation dependence of the photonic device , which introduces photon distinguishability . </S>",
    "<S> however , such results clearly show that fano interference , responsible for the existence of a bound state and fractional decay , is suppressed for two fermions . </S>",
    "<S> this is a signature of the pauli exclusion principle and can be explained by observing that no more than one fermion can be accommodated into the ( single ) dressed bound state , while the other fermion necessarily decays into the state continuum .    to better highlight the difference between bosonic and fermionic behaviour in the decay process </S>",
    "<S> , fano - like profiles are measured from the survival probability as the detuning of the energy levels of the two discrete states is varied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we fabricated and characterized other photonic structures , with fixed length @xmath42  mm , the same @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 as in the previous experiments , @xmath43  mm@xmath29 and different values for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup]c . for bosonic particles , </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability shows a clear peak at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the fractional decay observed in the previous experiment is indeed due to a fano resonance condition , which vanishes for detuned energies of the two discrete levels . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly this fano resonance peak is absent when the two particles possess fermionic statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that a generalization of this model to more than two discrete levels coupled to the continuum , will result in a possibly higher number of bound states and the influence of the particle statistics may be more articulated . however , as long as the number of bound states in the continuum is lower than the number of particles , a fermionic statistics will always suppress the fano resonance @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , this work has presented an experimental study on the quantum decay process of two identical particles , initially on discrete states , into a common continuum . a profound difference in the bosonic and fermionic evolution </S>",
    "<S> is evidenced ; in particular , a suppression of a fano resonance condition is observed for the fermionic case . </S>",
    "<S> the capability to simulate multi - particle dynamics in discrete systems coupled to a continuum may enable the investigation of other multi - particle decay phenomena , such as multi - particle zeno effects @xcite and non - markovianity @xcite .    </S>",
