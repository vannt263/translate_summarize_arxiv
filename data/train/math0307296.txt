    "in a famous preprint @xcite , g.  rybnikov proves the existence of two line arrangements @xmath2 in @xmath3 which have the same combinatorics but whose pairs , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are not homeomorphic .",
    "unfortunately , this work has not been published in its final form .",
    "this may be due to the difficulty of verifying some of its statements . in another work  ( @xcite ) ,",
    "some parts of rybnikov s paper are presented and explained , including a detailed verification of the quoted result .",
    "rybnikov also gives an outline for proving a stronger result : the fundamental groups of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not isomorphic .",
    "providing a complete proof of this result would be most interesting .    in the present work we are interested in the topology of complexified real arrangements .",
    "complexified real arrangements form a very important class of arrangements where more topological properties are known . in this work",
    "we prove the existence of complexified real arrangements with the same combinatorics but different embeddings in @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that rybnikov s arrangements do not admit real equations .",
    "the counterexamples obtained in this work have an additional property : they admit conjugated equations on the ring of polynomials over a number field , namely @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show the existence of such a pair of arrangements . in the following outline of the paper",
    ", we will stress the similarities and major diferences with ribnikov s approach :    * the first step towards finding such pairs of arrangements involves finding combinatorics whose moduli space is not connected . as a first approach , we will find _ ordered _ combinatorics whose moduli space is not connected ( an easier task ) .",
    "we proceed by considering an ordered line arrangement with equations in a finite field and then studying its complex realizations . in rybnikov",
    "s paper , the maclane arrangement in @xmath8 was considered . * in a second step we exhibit two ordered line arrangements @xmath9 which have the same ordered combinatorics but whose pairs , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are not homeomorphic by an order - preserving map .",
    "in order to prove this result we need to obtain some non - generic braid monodromies . in rybnikov s paper , the author constructs an invariant of the isomorphism class of fundamental groups of the complements of lines whose ordered combinatorics induce the _ identity _ on the first homology group . in  @xcite",
    "we describe an extension of rybnikov s invariant which has been implemented using maple . using it",
    ", we are able to double check rybnikov s example . unfortunately this invariant does not give any valuable information in our example .",
    "* finally , using the aforementioned arrangements @xmath12 we construct a pair of arrangements @xmath13 so that the pairs @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not homeomorphic .",
    "this idea is part of rybnikov s strategy : the fact that @xmath9 are _ real _ arrangements allows us to use simpler arguments .",
    "note that in our case the fundamental groups of @xmath6 and @xmath7 have isomorphic profinite completions , but we do not know whether or not they are isomorphic .",
    "in what follows , a brief description of combinatorics and ordered combinatorics of a line arrangement will be given .    a _ line combinatorics _ ( _ projective configuration _ in @xcite ) is a triple @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are finite subsets and @xmath17 is a relation between @xmath16 and @xmath15 satisfying :    * @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( in notation @xmath23 ) .",
    "* @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath19 , such that @xmath26 .",
    "analogously we define an _ ordered line combinatorics _ , where the elements of @xmath27 are ordered .",
    "if the context is not ambiguous , we will omit both @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the cardinal @xmath28 is denoted as @xmath29 and referred to as the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath30 ( as usual , points of multiplicity 2 are also called _",
    "double points _ and points of multiplicity 3 _ triple points _ ) .",
    "the second condition in a line combinatorics @xmath14 implies that @xmath31 .    a simple way to obtain line combinatorics is via arrangements in @xmath32 for some finite field @xmath33 . in such cases",
    "it is more practical to consider arrangements of points and then dualize .",
    "for example , the starting point in @xcite is the maclane arrangement .",
    "this arrangement can be defined as follows .",
    "consider @xmath34 as the union of @xmath35 and the line at infinity .",
    "consider also the points of @xmath36 : the maclane combinatorics is the abstract line combinatorics corresponding to the dual of this @xmath37 point arrangement .",
    "let @xmath15 be a line combinatorics .",
    "an _ automorphism _ of @xmath15 is a permutation of @xmath15 preserving the incidence relations .",
    "the set of such automorphisms is the _ automorphism group _ of @xmath15 .",
    "it is easily seen that the automorphism group of maclane combinatorics is naturally isomorphic to @xmath38 .",
    "the starting point of this work is a similar idea .",
    "let us consider @xmath39 as the union of @xmath40 and the line at infinity @xmath41 .",
    "let us consider @xmath42 where @xmath43 is any of the elements of @xmath44 ( and hence the other one is @xmath45 ) .",
    "note that @xmath46 .",
    "the set @xmath47 contains ten points , the last five of which will be denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "note that each point lies in a different line through the origin .",
    "let us denote by @xmath49 the point at infinity of the line passing through both the origin and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the following is a list of all the lines of @xmath39 that contain at least two points ( after each equation , a list of points in @xmath52 contained in the line is provided ) :    * the line @xmath41 containing @xmath53 . * lines through @xmath54 : @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) . * lines through @xmath61 : @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) . * lines through @xmath68 : @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . * lines through @xmath75 : @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . * lines through @xmath82 : @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath73 ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "first of all note that any @xmath111 preserves the multiplicity of any point . since @xmath118 one concludes that @xmath119 fixes @xmath120 and hence should interchange the five lines @xmath121 containing @xmath120 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath112 the permutation satisfying @xmath114 .",
    "note that each line @xmath110 determines @xmath122 ( as the only point of multiplicity 2 contained in @xmath110 ) and hence it determines @xmath123 ( as the other line containing @xmath122 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "because of this identification @xmath126 can be considered to act on @xmath90 on the right .",

    "regarding again @xmath126 as a subgroup of @xmath137 , it is easily seen that @xmath138 , that is , @xmath139 is a normal subgroup in @xmath140 . since @xmath141 ,",

    "it is enough to check that @xmath147 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will denote an automorphism in @xmath126 and its induced permutation in @xmath137 by the same symbol .",
    "let us consider @xmath119 an automorphism fixing at least two lines of type @xmath110 .",

    "let us consider @xmath119 an automorphism fixing only one line of type @xmath110 .",
    "again , after conjugation by an element in @xmath142 one may suppose such a line is @xmath148 .",
