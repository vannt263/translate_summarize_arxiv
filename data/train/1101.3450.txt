    "during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase a low- and intermediate - mass star experiences mass loss ( _ e.g. _  by thermal pulses ) that acts as the main source of replenishment of gas and dust to the interstellar medium .",
    "when the agb star evolves to the post - agb phase ( and later to the proto - planetary nebular ( ppn ) and the pn phase ) the mass loss drops by several orders of magnitude , while the circumstellar shells continue to drift away ( pushed by the - episodic - ( post)-agb wind ) from the star into the surrounding medium . for a constant mass loss rate a smooth envelope with decreasing column density , inverse to the radial distance from the central star ,",
    "is expected .",
    "if , on the other hand , the mass loss rate fluctuates ( as the star goes through thermal pulses during the agb ; @xcite ) , then enhanced emission should be observed in the form of multiple dust shells around the central star .",
    "thus , the history of mass loss during the agb phase is imprinted on the dust shell of the pn until it is disrupted by the fast post - agb wind",
    ". pre / proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) are objects in transition from the high mass loss rate agb phase to that of an ionized pn .",
    "however , little is known yet about the large extended shells around these evolved stars .",
    "therefore , young pne and proto - pne may have outer shells in which the fossil record of the mass loss during the agb phase is still preserved .",
    "cool dust present in circumstellar shells emits mainly in the infrared .",
    "early studies suggested that many pne are extended in the infrared , but usually with sizes comparable to the optical diameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "this indicated that the dust grains are generally well mixed with the ionized gas .",
    "however , iras also showed a few pne with the far - infrared emission extending beyond the limits derived from optical images .",
    "this suggested that cool dust may be present in a neutral envelope outside the inner ionized zone .",
    "the spatial extent and relative brightness distribution of the mid- and far - infrared radiation of the dust shells around pne provide important constraints on the evolution of the central star .",
    "in particular the mass loss conditions in the agb strongly constrain evolutionary models as this affects the distribution of ionized gas , molecular gas and cool dust in the resulting pn .",
    "recent spitzer / mips observations by @xcite have not revealed circumstellar dust shells around crl  2688 , as reported with iso .",
    "the latter were reported by @xcite who identified dust shells of about 23  pc in two post - agb stars .",
    "tentatively inferred a slightly extended emission from pn by means of isophot multi - aperture photometry .",
    "spitzer / mips observations of pn and ( at 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath0 m ; @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) both show that the 24  @xmath0 m morphology is strikingly similar to that seen in the optical ( due to the contribution of nebular emission lines in this band ) , while the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m images show an extended ( @xmath190 ) cold dust envelope around the nebula .",
    "more recently , @xcite compared the 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness profiles with those in the h@xmath2 line for a sample of 36 galactic pne ; they found that the infrared emission can be more extended , similar or present in the shell center only .",
    "@xcite suggested that these different groups of pne have an evolutionary connection - with the youngest pne showing more extended 24@xmath0 m emission ( due to hot dust ) than the h@xmath2 emmission .",
    "first results with herschel reveal detached and extended emission in the far - infrared associated to evolved stars ( @xcite ) as well as wind - ism interaction at several arcminutes from some objects , such as cwleo ( ) .",
    "the latter was also traced in the fuv by galex ( @xcite ) similar to the shock interface observed for mira ( @xcite ) .",
    "reported detached dust shells ( at @xmath130 - 50 ) associated with three agb stars located at 260825  pc ( we note that the most distant agb star had the dust shell located farthest away from the point source ) . extended - parsec - sized - far - infrared emission is expected to be present outside the ionized region in the neutral zone around post - agb stars and pne as indicated by observations ( @xcite ) , as well as theoretical work ( @xcite ) . therefore , if indeed the typical sizes of far - infrared dust emission extends over distances of 23  pc , the apparent sizes would range from 1  to 10  for distances in the range 0.5 to 3  kpc .",
    "these are the angular scales we aim to probe with the akari fis images .",
    "the exact size and shape of the extended emission will also depend strongly not only on the mass - loss rate but also on the relative velocity of the star and the density of the surronding interstellar medium .",
    "in this paper we present a far - infrared survey of thirteen post - agb stars and ( young / proto ) pne obtained with the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) on the japanese infrared astronomical mission akari .",

    "the reduced images for all targets are shown in figure  [ fig : fismap ] .",
    "from the reduced images we extract information on the total point source flux density and detection limits on the extended emission .",
    "azimuthally averaged radial profiles were constructed in order to search for extended spherical structures associated with faint extended dust emission .",

    "the sky background was determined from an annulus with inner and outer radii of 9 and 12 pixels , respectively . for the _ lw _  flux measurements we adopted an aperture radius of 3 pixels ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "the sky background was computed from an annulus with inner and outer radii of 6 and 8 pixels , respectively . to convert the obtained image fluxes to absolute fluxes we apply the diffuse - to - point correction factor as well as the aperture correction factor ( see table  [ tb : correctionfactors ] and @xcite ) .",
    "note that the flux calibration by aperture photometry refers to a flat ( @xmath14 = constant ) spectrum while the real flux depends on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source . at this stage",
    "we have not applied any color correction .",
    "@xcite report an absolute fis calibration accuracy better than 15% , except for the longest wavelength ( @xmath150% ) .",
    "these authors also report a tentative 10% decrease in observed flux in all bands for the fast ( 15/s ) scan speed with respect to the nominal 8/s scan speed .",
    "as all our targets were obtained with 15/s this may result in a small underestimation of the final flux densities .",
    "furthermore , we assume these calibration factors are valid also for cds mode ( recommended for very bright sources ) observations although this has not been verified in depth .",
    "our results can be compared directly with the spectral energy distribution provided for 5 targets included in the _ toru catalogue of galactic post - agb and related objects _ ( ) . from these seds there appears to be no evidence for systematic lower ( or higher ) than expected flux densities .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare_flux ] illustrates that the absolute fluxes for bright point sources measured with akari fis at 65 and 90  @xmath0 m are , at a first approximation , consistent with the iras fluxes at 60 and 100  @xmath0 m , even without applying a color correction . for the post - agb / proto - pne in our sample , nebular lines are expected to contribute little to the fir broad band emission ; this effect could be more significant for the pne .",
    "this consistency is also an important calibration check for flux densities reported in the akari bright source catalog ( yamamura et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "for the 90 and 140  @xmath0 m maps we also measure the average flux noise level ( jy arcmin@xmath15 ) from the sky background within 2 to 5  from the point source .",

    "these upper limits are used in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] to derive upper limits on the dust and gas mass in the extended envelopes .",
    "we extracted the azimuthally averaged radial profile for each target in each filter band .",
    "in addition , we extract radial profiles from calibration point sources ( vesta and neptune ) processed in the same manner as our targets .",
    "the radial profiles for the calibration point sources and all post - agb and pne sources are shown on a log  log scale in figure  [ fig : radprofiles ] for the two most senstive bands at 90 and 140  @xmath0 m . due to the width of the image maps proper radial profiles",
    "can only be obtained out to radii of about 300 . as indicated above , there is no unambiguous evidence for extended emission within 2  of the point source .",
    "the sensitivity of these maps is insufficient to unambiguously detect weak detached emission between 2  and  5 .",
    "one potential exception is iras21046 + 4739 , for which localized far - infrared emission at 140  @xmath0 m ( and also present in the 160  @xmath0 m map ) could be related directly to the pn .",
    "[ fig : images ]",
    "individual modeling of the spectral energy distribution of these targets with a complex radiative transfer code ( like dusty ) is beyond the scope of this paper , which is focussed on the cold extended / detached circumstellar dust emission , as the new photometry points ( of the central source ) do not add significant constraints to the problem with respect to previous studies .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of our akari fis maps with simulated images ( or seds ) of the expected extended dust emission seems to be inappropiate due to the lack of a clear detection of extended emission in the akari images ; such models ( _ e.g. _ , 2-dust ; @xcite ) also have their own limitations and assumptions , as well as many free parameters . in particular , the uncertain distances to the post - agb objects in our sample affect the model results .",
    "thus , we adopt here a simple dust model , together with the upper limits derived from the new fis maps ( table  [ tb : photometry ] ) , in order to give first order estimates on upper limits on the detected dust ( and gas ) mass in the extended envelopes of these evolved objects .",
    "interstellar and circumstellar dust emits primarily in the infrared .",

    "the former give @xmath32 = 976  @xmath24  g@xmath19 , while the latter gives , via @xmath33 , @xmath32 = 36  @xmath24  g@xmath19 .",
    "conservative dust mass limits are obtained by adopting the latter values for @xmath31 .",

    "iras21046 + 4739 appears to be the only target in which the extended structure also causes a faint far - infrared emission excess in the _ lw _  radial profile at radii between 30 and 130 .",

    "iras17119 - 5926 , however , is a peculiar source that is thought to have evolved only recently , in the last few decades , from a post - agb into a pn . therefore , variability in its infrared flux might occur due to recent mass loss event(s ) or evolution of the central star .",
    "this is supported also by the lower continuum level from the sws spectrum .",
    "the latter appearing in fact more consistent with the new fis flux densities . for iras17395 - 0841",

    "four other sources in our sample have high cirrus values in the iras psc but their fis fluxes match well with those given by iras . also , from the seds we find that nebular emission , as expected for post - agb / proto - pne , contributes very little to the observed broad band flux .",
    "our observations provide imaging of post - agb and ( p)pne beyond 100@xmath0 m for which only limited information is currently available .",
    "the akari fis photometry is generally consistent , considering also color correction , differences in filter curves and absolute calibration uncertainties , with the available seds , based in the infrared - primarily on iras and iso data .",
    "we also conclude that the far - infrared point source emission detected toward our sample of post - agb stars and ( p)pne originates from a compact region unresolved by the fis .",
    "the observed background emission ( measured for each map ) was used to derive first order upper limits on the mass in ` cold ' extended emission .",
    "the derived dust and gas masses are strongly dependent on , in particular , the adopted distance , and adopted grain size and emissivity ( both of which affect the equilibrium dust temperature ) .",
    "for a few objects we note potentially diffuse infrared emission structures that could be related to detached shells or wind - ism interaction ; iras10178 - 5958 shows two arcs at 4 and 8  from the central object at 140 and 160  @xmath0 m , iras10197 - 5750 shows two shells at 10  in the short wavelength filters and a peculiar cold dust bar at the longest wavelengths , and iras21046 + 4739 reveals both in the fis images and the radial profiles extended emission near the central source ( @xmath413 ) at 140 and 160  @xmath0 m .",
    "further studies of the extended emission ( in particular for the objects with tentative detections of mass - loss events ) will require multi - wavelength observations to obtain not only an estimate of the total dust and gas mass but also some insight into the basic properties ( temperature , size , composition ) of grains in these extended shells .",
    "imaging with both improved sensitivity and higher spatial resolution are required to observe extended structures due to cold dust associated with the sources presented above . in particular the capabilities of the herschel space observatory are favorable to detecting the coldest dust components in extended areas and at the high spatial resolution required to disentangle circumstellar dust from cirrus dust .    the akari fis team ( m. shirahata , s. matsuura , s. makiuti , i. yamamura , and e. verdugo ) is warmly thanked for providing helpful information on the data processing .",

    "<S> by tracing the distribution of cool dust in the extended envelopes of post - agb stars and ( proto)-planetary nebulae ( ( p)pne ) we aim to recover , or constrain , the mass loss history experienced by these stars in their recent past . the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) instrument on board </S>",
    "<S> the akari satellite was used to obtain far - infrared maps for a selected sample of post - agb stars and ( p)pne . </S>",
    "<S> we derived flux densities ( aperture photometry ) for 13 post - agb stars and ( p)pne at four far - infrared wavelengths ( 60 , 90 , 140 , and 160  @xmath0 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> radial ( azimuthally averaged ) profiles are used to investigate the presence of extended emission from cool dust .    </S>",
    "<S> no ( detached ) extended emission is detected for any target in our sample at levels significant with respect to background and cirrus emission . </S>",
    "<S> only iras21046 + 4739 reveals tentative excess emission between 30 and 130 . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the total dust and gas mass from the obtained maps indicate that the envelope masses of these stars should be large in order to be detected with the akari fis . </S>",
    "<S> imaging with higher sensitivity and higher spatial resolution is needed to detect and resolve , if present , any cool compact or extended emission associated with these evolved stars . </S>"
