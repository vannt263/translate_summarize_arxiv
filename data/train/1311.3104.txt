    "with the age of gravitational wave astronomy almost upon us , interest in the general relativistic two - body problem has surged over the past decade .",
    "two body systems are expected to be amongst the brightest sources of gravitational waves . despite this , waveform templates are still required in order to accurately disentangle the signal from the detector noise . there",
    "now exist a wide range of approaches to modeling general relativistic two - body systems , each applicable to a different regime of the problem .    for the case where one of the components of the system is substantially more massive than the other a perturbative treatment can be made , expanding in powers of the mass ratio . treating the smaller component as a point particle , the first - order - in - the - mass - ratio dissipative dynamics",
    "are now well understood @xcite , and there has been steady progress in understanding conservative corrections to the orbital motion @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the conservative dynamics has proven particularly fruitful , as it has allowed for exchanges and comparisons with other approaches to the two - body problem @xcite .",
    "it has recently been proposed that the range of mass ratios for which black hole perturbation theory is valid may be broad enough to include so - called intermediate - mass - ratio inspirals @xcite .",
    "excitingly , such systems are candidates for detection in the forthcoming generation of advanced gravitational wave observatories @xcite . for future space - based detectors , black hole perturbation theory will be key to modeling so - called extreme - mass - ratio inspirals @xcite .    in both cases",
    "it is desired to track the phase evolution of the binary to order unity over many hundreds or thousands of orbits @xcite .",
    "to achieve such a high level of accuracy , it is necessary to include second - order - in - the - mass - ratio corrections to the motion @xcite . beyond improved waveform models ,",
    "calculation of the second - order corrections will provide another rich seam of information that can be compared with results from other approaches to the two - body problem .",
    "such a calculation is also timely as the theoretical framework required to make a second - order - in - the - mass - ratio calculation has recently been laid @xcite . before considering how to approach a second - order calculation , it is instructive to review the methods used at first order .",
    "owing to the point particle model , the first - order - in - the - mass - ratio metric perturbation is divergent at the particle s location .",
    "the appropriate regularization scheme to compute the backreaction , or self - force , on the particle was first laid down by mino , sasaki and tanaka @xcite and quinn and wald @xcite and has been elucidated upon by a number of authors since @xcite ( see poisson  for a review @xcite ) .",
    "the original regularization scheme involved integrating the retarded green function from past infinity up to , but not including , the current time .",
    "this formulation of the regularization procedure is challenging to work with directly , though there has been progress recently @xcite .",
    "most self - force calculations to - date have used reformulations of the original regularization procedure .",
    "the particular details of each scheme depend principally on how the metric perturbation is obtained .",
    "one option is to decompose the retarded metric perturbation into spherical - harmonic modes .",
    "one then finds that the individual multipole modes of the metric perturbation are finite at the location of the particle .",
    "this observation led to the development of the mode - sum regularization scheme , which subtracts an appropriate singular field from the retarded field mode - by - mode @xcite . for perturbations of schwarzschild spacetime such",
    "a decomposition is also advantageous as the individual multipole modes of the metric perturbation decouple from one another . in the axially symmetric kerr spacetime",
    "the multipole modes remain coupled and , though it is possible to proceed with a calculation of this form @xcite , researchers have devoted considerable effort into 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 decompositions . in these formulations",
    "the retarded metric perturbation remains divergent at the particle s location and so , in order to compute the self - force , effective - source approaches were devised @xcite . in these approaches",
    "the singular component of the field is approximated in a neighborhood of the particle .",
    "this approximation is then used to construct a sourced field equation , so that far from the particle the retarded field is obtained and nearby the particle a residual field , loosely the retarded field minus the singular field , is directly solved for .",
    "the effective - source approach has been successfully applied to 1 + 1 @xcite , 2 + 1 @xcite and 3 + 1 @xcite schemes but as yet has not been applied to frequency domain calculations .",
    "the primary reason for this is that at first order in the mass ratio it is not necessary ; the metric perturbation is finite at the particle within a frequency domain decomposition . at second order in the mass ratio , even within a spherical - harmonic decomposition ,",
    "the metric perturbation is divergent at the particle and , as such , the mode - sum method can not be applied . instead",
    "an effective - source approach must be pursued .",
    "furthermore , the effects of the second - order metric perturbation will be very small , being suppressed by two orders of the mass ratio relative to test body effects .",
    "this suggests a frequency domain treatment of the problem where one encounters _ ordinary differential equations _ ( odes ) which are relatively easy to compute numerically to high accuracy .",
    "another reason for considering a frequency - domain approach is that time - domain codes for evolving the lorenz - gauge gravitational perturbation equations exhibit instabilities in the monopole and dipole modes @xcite .",
    "though there has been progress in resolving these issues @xcite there is currently no robust formalism to stably evolve the low multipole modes in the time domain .",
    "these three observations are the main motivations for developing a frequency - domain effective - source approach to self - force calculations .",
    "to develop the method , we present in this work a toy scalar - field calculation which provides a clear worked example of our approach in schwarzschild spacetime . in a second paper",
    "we will apply the method to lorenz gauge gravitational perturbations @xcite .",

    "consider a particle of mass @xmath3 carrying a scalar charge , @xmath4 , moving on a circular geodesic about a schwarzschild black hole . in this work we shall ignore the effects of the particle s gravitational self - interaction and",
    "focus on the self - force arising from the particle s scalar field .",
    "furthermore , we will not consider the backreaction to the particle s motion arising from this force .",
    "instead we seek to calculate the instantaneous force felt by a particle that has spent its entire past history moving along a circular orbit of fixed radius .",
    "let us denote the particle s worldline by @xmath5 and its four - velocity by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the particle s proper time .",
    "for a particle on a circular orbit of radius @xmath8 , @xmath9 and , without loss of generality , we shall assume the motion to be in the equatorial plane ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "as we are considering a scalar field theory , there is a wide scope for choosing the field equation @xcite . in this work",
    "we proscribe that the particle s scalar field , @xmath17 , obeys the field equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the covariant derivative with respect to the background metric and @xmath20 is the particle s scalar charge density .",

    "the source can be decomposed into spherical harmonic and frequency modes in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the standard scalar spherical harmonics with @xmath27 the associated legendre polynomial and @xmath28 .",
    "our choice of normalization for the spherical harmonics gives @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the usual kronecker delta and a @xmath32 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the periodicity of the orbit implies that each fourier mode frequency is an integer multiple overtone of the base orbital frequency , i.e. , @xmath33 for integer @xmath34 .",
    "the radial dependence of the source can then be calculated via @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "we thus see that each azimuthal mode contains a single fourier harmonic of frequency @xmath37    knowing the discrete spectrum of the source we can write the field as a sum over spherical harmonic and fourier modes in the form @xmath38 decomposing the wave operator into spherical harmonic and frequency modes , and dividing by @xmath39 , we define @xmath40 the field equation for the radial field , @xmath41 is then given by @xmath42 this equation can be solved for mode - by - mode , with the retarded solution constructed by selecting appropriate boundary conditions on the horizon and at spatial infinity . as the source is confined to the equatorial plane , only the modes with @xmath43 even contribute to the sum in eq .  .",
    "let us denote the inner and outer homogeneous solutions to eq .   by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "for the radiative modes ( @xmath46 ) we introduce the tortoise radial coordinate , @xmath47 , defined by @xmath48 , giving explicitly @xmath49 where we have specified the constant of integration such that @xmath47 and @xmath50 coincide at @xmath51 . in this coordinate system spatial infinity is at @xmath52 and the event horizon is at @xmath53 . the asymptotic boundary conditions for the retarded field are then given by @xmath54 which ensures radiation is outgoing at spatial infinity and ingoing at the event horizon .",
    "in general there are no closed form solutions for the radiative modes , and so we will solve for these modes numerically as we describe below in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the time independence of the static ( @xmath55 ) modes implies that the advanced and retarded solutions are the same with regularity at the boundaries being sufficient to select the correct homogeneous solutions . in this case",

    "an appropriate regularization procedure for calculating the self - force on a point particle coupled to a scalar field in a curved spacetime was first given by quinn @xcite .",
    "later , detweiler and whiting gave an alternative perspective to regularization @xcite .",
    "in their description the self - force is computed from a regular field , @xmath69 , via @xmath70 the regular field is constructed by subtracting an appropriate singular field , @xmath71 , from the usual retarded field @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73{\\hskip0.00cm.}\\ ] ] the precise construction of an appropriate singular field is discussed at length in refs .",
    "one of the key features of the three fields @xmath74 is that they obey the field equations @xmath75 from which we see that both @xmath72 and @xmath71 diverge in the same way at the particle s location , whereas their difference , @xmath69 , remains finite . from eqs .",
    "and we can write the self - force as @xmath76      \\nonumber \\\\                                              & = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow x_p}\\left[f^{\\text{ret}}_\\alpha(x ) - f^s_\\alpha\\right(x)]{\\hskip0.0cm,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 the divergence of @xmath78 at the particle makes this equation challenging to work with directly and so over the years it has been recast into forms more amenable to practical calculation .",
    "two of these recastings , the mode - sum scheme and effective - source approach , we discuss now .",
    "the first step in the mode - sum approach to practical regularization is to decompose the right hand side of eq .   into spherical - harmonic modes .",
    "the key feature of this decomposition is that the two angular integrals `` smooth out '' the delta - function source so that the individual multipole modes of the field and its derivatives are finite at the particle s location .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath79{\\hskip0.0cm,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a superscript @xmath80 denotes a quantity s decomposition into spherical - harmonic modes and summed over @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 in taking the limit to the worldline in eq .",
    "some care is required .",
    "though the individual @xmath83-mode contributions @xmath84 are finite at the particle , in general , their sided limits @xmath85 give two different values , which we denote by @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "for circular orbits there is no closed - form solution for @xmath87 , and typically it is computed numerically .",
    "the singular field , on the other hand , is amenable to an analytical treatment .",
    "the local structure of the singular field was first analyzed by mino  @xcite , and the mode - sum method was developed shortly after by barack and ori @xcite .",
    "the formula they obtained for the regularized field and self - force is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath80-independent @xmath91 are known as regularization parameters and their value is known for generic geodesic orbits in schwarzschild @xcite and kerr spacetime @xcite . in general @xmath92 and , for circular orbits , the other nonzero regularization parameters are given by @xmath93}{\\pi f_0 v^{3/2 } }    { \\hskip0.0cm,}\\\\      b_\\text{field }   & = q\\frac{2k(w)}{\\pi\\sqrt{{\\mathcal{l}}_0 ^ 2+r_0 ^ 2}}{\\hskip0.0cm,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds , respectively , and @xmath96 as the series in eqs .   and is truncated at @xmath97 , the residual series converges like @xmath98 .",
    "it is possible to derive higher - order regularization parameters that serve to increase the convergence rate of the mode - sum .",
    "it is common practice in mode - sum calculations to fit for these terms numerically .",
    "analytically , detweiler  @xcite made the first calculation of a higher - order parameter for a scalar particle on a circular orbit about a schwarzschild black hole , and recently heffernan  computed the next 3 or 4 parameters for scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational particles for generic geodesic motion in schwarzschild @xcite and kerr geometry @xcite .",
    "the effective - source approach provides an alternative method for handling the divergence of the retarded field . rather than first computing the retarded field and then subtracting the singular piece as a postprocessing step",
    ", one can instead work directly with an equation for the regular field .",
    "this idea , independently proposed by barack and golbourn @xcite and by vega and detweiler @xcite has the distinct advantage of involving only regular quantities , making it applicable in a wider variety of scenarios than the mode - sum scheme .    using eq .   to rewrite @xmath99 in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath71 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath100 if @xmath71 is exactly the detweiler - whiting singular field , then the two terms on the right hand side of this equation cancel and @xmath69 would be a homogeneous solution of the wave equation .",
    "however , one typically does not have access to an exact expression for @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , the detweiler - whiting singular field is defined through a hadamard parametrix which is not even defined globally . instead ,",
    "the best one can typically do is a local expansion which is valid only in the vicinity of the worldline . denoting an approximation to @xmath71 by @xmath101 ,",
    "the corresponding approximate regular field is a solution of the sourced wave equation with an _ effective source _ given by @xmath102 this effective source is finite everywhere , but has limited differentiability on the worldline .",
    "an additional level of complexity arises from the fact that the approximation to the singular field is valid only in the vicinity of the worldline . to avoid ambiguities in its definition far from the worldline",
    ", one must ensure that the singular field goes to zero there .",
    "this is most easily achieved by multiplying @xmath101 by a window function , @xmath103 , with properties such that multiplying it by @xmath101 only modifies terms higher order in the local expansion about the worldline than those which are explicitly given in @xmath101 . in our particular case",
    ", it suffices to choose @xmath103 such that @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 far away from the worldline .",
    "the residual field then obeys @xmath108 and has the properties @xmath109 as the residual field coincides with the retarded field far from the particle we can use the usual retarded field boundary conditions when solving eq .  .",
    "we now describe the application of the effective - source approach to frequency - domain calculations of the self - force .",
    "we first compute a suitable puncture .",
    "we then show how to compute the effective source using a worldtube - like window function .",
    "finally we demonstrate how the effective - source method can be used to construct the residual field .",
    "we seek a suitable radial puncture function @xmath110 which must satisfy the property that when summed over spherical harmonic @xmath111 modes it agrees with the detweiler - whiting singular field and its first derivative when evaluated on the worldline .",
    "to construct an appropriate puncture function , we begin with a local coordinate series approximation to the detweiler - whiting singular field , obtained in terms of riemann normal coordinates centered on the particle s worldline using the methods of ref .",
    "we then adapt methods developed for the mode - sum regularization approach @xcite to analytically decompose the result into spherical - harmonic modes .",
    "finally , we transform the spherical - harmonic components to components in the unrotated coordinate frame .      using @xmath112 to represent the spherical coordinates in a rotated coordinate system , we orient the coordinates such that the particle is instantaneously located at @xmath113 and the tangent to its worldline is pointing along the @xmath114 direction . using @xmath115 to represent the standard spherical",
    "coordinates where the worldline is on the equator , @xmath116 , the two coordinate systems are related by @xmath117 this is equivalent to a rotation by euler angles @xmath118 .",
    "the first rotation ( by an angle @xmath24 around the @xmath119-axis ) ensures that the particle is at @xmath120 , the second rotation ( by @xmath121 about the new @xmath122-axis ) aligns the north pole with the particle s position , and the third rotation ( by @xmath121 about the new @xmath119-axis ) orients the coordinates such that the tangent to the worldline is pointing along @xmath114 .",
    "working in these rotated coordinates , a coordinate series approximation to the detweiler - whiting singular field may generally be written in a way such that all terms have the form @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a function of the worldline parameters only , @xmath125 is the order of the term in the expansion , @xmath34 is odd , @xmath126 @xmath127 , @xmath128 is a function of the particle s position , four - velocity and @xmath129 , and @xmath130 with the proportionality constant depending on @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    for our frequency - domain",
    "effective source , it suffices to keep only the leading two orders in the expansion so that it has the form @xmath131 this approximation is sufficient for directly computing the regularized self - force without any postprocessing regularization step .",
    "the effect of neglecting the higher - order terms in the expansion is to limit the mode - sum to quadratic  as opposed to exponential  convergence . while it would be possible to include the higher - order terms in the puncture to improve convergence , it turns out not to be necessary to do so . as we show later , a better solution in terms of computational efficiency is to use the standard mode - sum regularization parameters given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we next seek to decompose this puncture into spherical - harmonic modes labeled by @xmath83 and @xmath132 .",
    "this proceeds in the same spirit as the standard approach to the computation of regularization parameters @xcite .",
    "the advantage of working in a rotated coordinate frame is now apparent ; only the @xmath133 spherical - harmonic modes are nonvanishing on the polar axis one would also require the modes @xmath134 .",
    "however , that turns out not to be the case here ; the spatial portion of the wave operator depends only on @xmath83 , and the time derivatives are given analytically by multiplication by @xmath135 .",
    "] so we can obtain an approximate decomposition valid near the worldline by considering only @xmath133 .",

    "the integration is then trivially given by the orthogonality relations @xmath140 in the traditional mode - sum regularization approach , at this point one would evaluate this at @xmath141 .",
    "however , since we require an extended puncture function in a neighborhood of the worldline we instead use a power series in @xmath142 . for the second - order puncture , the required expansions are @xmath143    the integration over the azimuthal angle , @xmath144 , now reduces to integrals which either vanish or contain only integer and half - integer powers of @xmath145 , with @xmath146 being a function of the particle s position and four - velocity .",

    "the most straightforward option is to use a simple gaussian window function .",
    "this choice is simple to implement and allows for a smooth transition from the residual field near the particle to the retarded field far away .",
    "the downside is that it leads to a noncompact effective source , which formally leads to an integral over an infinite domain when using the method of variation of parameters to construct the inhomogeneous fields .",
    "one alternative would be to use the window function of vega  @xcite which leads to a compact effective source and allows for a smooth transition from the residual to the retarded field .",
    "another alternative , which also provides a compact source , is to use the worldtube approach of barack and golbourn @xcite . in this work",

    "we find our method computes the radial self - force to a relative accuracy of better than @xmath220 . in table",

    "in this paper we have formulated the effective - source self - force approach in the frequency domain and shown how it can be used to compute the self - force in the case of a scalar charge on a circular orbit of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the approach allows us to implement regularization of individual @xmath171 modes of the retarded field including an arbitrary number of derivatives .",
    "we validated our results against those obtained with mode - sum calculations on a mode - by - mode basis , with differences which can be attributed to machine round - off .",
    "an obvious next step is to apply the method to the gravitational case of the self - force on a point mass . in that case , the method proceeds in essentially the same way , albeit with additional complexity from the tensor nature of the field  the full details of this calculation will be presented in a subsequent paper @xcite .    the true advantage of our new method is not apparent in a first order calculation ; after all , the standard mode - sum scheme is perfectly adequate for a first order self - force calculation and there is little benefit to the use of an effective - source approach .",
    "however , with the method well - developed , its true use is its ability to handle situations where a mode decomposition alone is insufficient to render the fields finite .",
    "for example , in gravitational self - force calculations at second perturbative order @xcite there are terms which involve @xmath278 , which will result in the spherical - harmonic modes of the field diverging as @xmath279 , and an effective - source approach is essential .    for the example given here , we chose to use a second - order puncture as an approximation to the singular field .",
    "with higher - order punctures being readily available , it may seem logical to incorporate these higher orders into the effective source .",
    "however , it turns out that doing so is neither necessary nor beneficial .",
    "since we have shown here the equivalence of the mode - sum and effective - source schemes , a much more straightforward , and computationally efficient approach is to stick with a second order puncture and achieve improvements in accuracy by subtracting the standard higher - order regularization parameters as a post - processing step .",
    "this retains the accuracy benefits while keeping the computational cost of evaluating the effective source to a minimum .",
    "although the focus of this paper has been on implementing the effective - source scheme in the frequency domain , the methods developed may also be of use in improving the accuracy of time domain calculations .",
    "existing time domain approaches have relied on either numerical evolutions in @xmath280 or @xmath281 dimensions , or on @xmath282 evolutions with a source which has been decomposed into spherical - harmonic modes through numerical integrations @xcite .",
    "this severely limits the efficiency of any code as the potentially - complicated effective source must always be evaluated on a three dimensional grid .",
    "the punctures developed for our frequency - domain scheme present an ideal solution to the problem ; by decomposing _ analytically _ into spherical - harmonic modes the computation of the effective source is made more efficient by orders of magnitude , enabling the use of accurate @xmath282 time domain calculations without the previous limitation of having a complicated and computationally expensive effective source to evaluate .",
    "finally , we have focused here only on the relatively straightforward case of a non - spinning schwarzschild black hole .",
    "one would eventually want to apply the method to the more astrophysically relevant case of a spinning kerr black hole . the missing piece in that case would be the adaption of the methods described here to the use of a _ spheroidal _ harmonic basis . while many of the methods would carry over unchanged ,",
    "it is likely that the decomposition of the puncture would be more involved .",
