    "photon - hadron interactions at high energies can be described in the rest frame of the hadron using a picture in which the incoming photon undergoes a fluctuation into virtual partonic or hadronic states , which subsequently interact strongly with the hadron . a number of singly - dissociative diffractive processes , namely elastic compton scattering , photon dissociation , exclusive vector meson production and deeply virtual compton scattering , can be formulated in terms of a quantity , the _ colour dipole cross - section _ , which is universal for a given hadron target  @xcite .",
    "we report on a successful attempt to extract the cross - section for scattering colour dipoles of fixed transverse size off protons using both electroproduction and photoproduction @xmath3 total cross - section data , subject to the constraint provided by the ratio of the overall photon dissociation cross - section to the total cross - section .",
    "we begin by briefly summarising the colour dipole model of diffraction ; we then describe the assumed forms of the dipole cross - section and the photon wave functions before discussing the data fits and the resulting values of the dipole cross - section .",
    "our first task is to introduce the colour dipole cross - section and relate it to the @xmath3 total cross - section .",
    "here we follow closely the treatment of  @xcite . of particular utility in the study of diffractive scattering",
    "is a decomposition of the strongly interacting fluctuations of the photon into a superposition of fock states in the quark - gluon basis : @xmath4    we define @xmath5 as the transverse separation averaged over all orientations of the quark - antiquark pair and @xmath6 as the fraction of the light - cone energy of the photon carried by one of the pair ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_op ] ) .",
    "quark - antiquark states with definite values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 preserve these values during the diffractive process ; or , to put it another way , they are eigenstates of the scattering matrix @xmath7 when it is restricted to diffractive processes .",
    "this we shall call the diffraction operator .",
    "the quark - antiquark eigenstates are called _",
    "colour dipoles_. expanding the virtual photon in these states gives @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the _ light cone wave function _ of the photon .",
    "the diffractive process modulates the light cone wave function by the eigenvalue @xmath10 of the diffraction operator : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the _ impact parameter _ of the dipole with respect to the proton centre , being a weighted sum of the individual impact parameters @xmath13 of its constituents :  @xcite @xmath14 the factor @xmath15 in ( [ eq : eigen_val ] ) is inserted for convenience ; it ensures that @xmath10 is predominantly real ( since diffractive amplitudes are predominantly imaginary ) .",
    "consider the @xmath16 total cross - section in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "we first express the elastic scattering amplitude for @xmath17 in terms of the mandelstam variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which can be done by a fourier transform with respect to the momentum conjugate to @xmath12 , namely the perpendicular part of the proton momentum transfer : @xmath20 .",
    "so we arrive at @xmath21 use of the optical theorem leads to @xmath22 the second integral expression defines the colour dipole cross - section : @xmath23 this is the total cross - section for scattering dipoles of a specified configuration @xmath24 off a proton .",
    "there are other interesting processes which involve the dipole cross - section : vector meson production and photon dissociation .",
    "the formulation of the first is straightforward .",
    "the differential cross - section is given by : @xmath25^{2}\\ ] ]    for photon dissociation , we can express the final state as an incoherent sum of the diffractive eigenstates ( dipole states ) :  @xcite @xmath26 and hence @xmath27 note that only that subset of the diffractive dissociation final state which is composed exclusively of a quark  anti - quark pair has been included in this expression .",
    "the dipole cross - section thus constitutes a link between three distinct physical processes .",
    "if the dipole cross - section is known , then vector meson wave functions predicted from models can be inserted in ( [ eq : vector_mes ] ) and the models tested by comparison of the result with experiment .",
    "alternatively , the vector meson wave function itself can be extracted .",
    "in what follows , our aim is to extract the dipole cross - section from total cross - section data for virtual photoabsorption by protons ( structure function and real photoabsorption data ) ; and to use the result to predict the contribution to the photon dissociation rate from dipole scattering . in order to do this , it is necessary to assume parametric forms for the dipole cross - section which embody reasonable theoretical requirements , but are otherwise flexible .",
    "here we describe the form used in our fits , together with our assumptions for the photon wavefunction .",
    "the dipole cross - section is in general a function of @xmath6 , @xmath28 and @xmath5 .",
    "however a non - perturbative calculation reveals little @xmath6 dependence  @xcite and we shall neglect it completely in what follows .",
    "following other authors  @xcite we assume the existence of two distinct terms which carry a regge type @xmath29 dependence : the hard term , which is assumed to dominate at small @xmath5 but vanish in the limit of large @xmath5 ; and the soft term , with an @xmath29 exponent close to zero , which is assumed to dominate at large @xmath5 and saturate .",
    "specifically , we assume @xmath30 where the @xmath5-dependences are given by @xmath31 in these formulae the energy variable @xmath29 has an associated @xmath32 factor , which yields an implicit @xmath33 dependence and approximate scaling on integrating over the photon wavefunction .",
    "apart from this , both terms possess a limiting @xmath32 dependence at small @xmath5 in accordance with colour transparency , which contains an implicit @xmath33 dependence , rather than @xmath29 .",
    "it is unnatural to have a @xmath33 dependence in the dipole cross - section itself  @xcite and we prefer to introduce it as the transform of an additional @xmath5 dependence via the photon wave function . ]",
    "arguments  @xcite .",
    "the squared polynomials in @xmath5 provide a fine tuning of the @xmath5 dependence that is strictly non - negative .      in the first instance , we used the tree level qed form of the photon light cone wave function : @xmath34 \\epsilon^{2 } k_{1}^{2}(\\epsilon",
    "r ) + m_{f}^{2 }   k_{0}^{2}(\\epsilon r ) \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 are modified bessel functions and the sum is over quark flavours .",
    "the quark masses can be neglected at large @xmath33 , but are important at low @xmath38 .",
    "here we assume three light quark flavours with a generic value @xmath39 gev@xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds roughly to a constituent quark mass and enables good fits to real as well as virtual photon data to be obtained .",
    "the use of a constituent as opposed to a current quark mass can be regarded as a partial reflection of confinement .",
    "subsequently we found it necessary to incorporate other confinement effects in the wavefunction , as described below .",
    "finally , the absence of a @xmath6 dependence in the dipole cross - section allows us to explicitly integrate over it in ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) to give @xmath40 for @xmath41 , where @xmath42k_{0}^{2}(\\epsilon r )   + \\frac{[z^{2 } + ( 1-z)^{2 } ] \\epsilon^{2 } k_{1}^{2 } ( \\epsilon r)}{4 } \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the @xmath43 data set consisted of hera 1994 and 1995 data from the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite experiments , together with the fixed target e665 values  @xcite .",
    "this was combined with the very precise intermediate energy photoproduction data  @xcite plus the two high energy points from h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite respectively .",
    "the following cuts were imposed :    * a cut in @xmath29 ( @xmath44 ) to ensure the data was sufficiently high energy . * a cut in @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) to ensure the data was diffractive . * a cut in @xmath38 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "altogether there were 345 @xmath43 and 20 photoabsorption data points , compared to 10 adjustable parameters in our final fits , described below .    in fitting these data , the purely diffractive contribution described above",
    "was supplemented by a small non - diffractive component arising from the leading meson exchange trajectories .",
    "this was assumed to be given by the empirical donnachie ",
    "landshoff form :  @xcite @xmath48 its contribution was always less than 15% for photoproduction and typically 3% or less for electroproduction .",
    "the inversion of integral equations of the type in ( [ eq : z_int ] ) presents notorious problems of non - uniqueness and instability ( sensitivity to small alterations in input data ) of the resulting function  @xcite .",
    "certain features of our fits , however , mitigate these effects .",
    "our parameterization ensures that the dipole cross - section is strictly positive , as is essential from its physical interpretation , and this already goes a long way to ensure that the output is robust towards data fluctuations .",
    "further , we have imposed many additional constraints from physical considerations which limit the degree of arbitrariness in the final fit .",
    "nevertheless , we were unable to achieve a positive definite error matrix for our fits so that the errors quoted below are approximate .      using the qed photon wave functions of ( [ eq : psi^2 ] ) led to successful fits to the @xmath49 total cross - section data using the above and other similar parameterizations .",
    "however , although the @xmath50 values typically ranged from 0.9 to 1.2 per degree of freedom , this was achieved at the price of unphysically large dipole cross - sections for dipole sizes greater than or of order 1 fm .",
    "for example , these were found to be of order 100  mb at @xmath51 , compared with a @xmath52 cross - section of about 25 mb  @xcite .",
    "such a large dipole cross - section has the effect of predicting much too high a rate for diffractive processes , which are more sensitive to large dipoles since the dipole cross - section is squared in ( [ eq : phot_diss ] ) .",
    "this rate can be calculated from our parameterisation using  ( [ eq : phot_diss ] ) and integrating over @xmath19 using the relation @xmath53 where for the slope parameter @xmath12 we used the value 7.2 gev@xmath54  @xcite .",
    "this leads to predicted diffractive cross - sections which are typically over 45% of the total for real photons .",
    "in contrast , the experimental values are @xmath55 @xmath56  @xcite according to the h1 collaboration and @xmath57 @xmath58  @xcite according to the zeus collaboration .",
    "thus , in spite of the apparent success of the fits , there are clearly serious shortcomings in the above approach .",
    "this is confirmed by both the flexibility of the functional forms chosen , and the fact that we could not fit the data at all when we impose reasonable limits on the cross - sections for large dipoles .",
    "the obvious suspect is the assumed form of the photon wave function at large transverse size , where confinement effects are surely significant .",
    "we adopt a pragmatic , _ a posteriori _ approach to this problem by modifying the photon wave function so that the soft contribution to the dipole cross - section is brought into line with the above experimental constraints , while the hard contribution is unaltered .    as mentioned above",
    ", the high value for the diffractive to total cross - section ratio is indicative of inflated values of the dipole cross - section at large @xmath5 .",
    "if the photon wave function were larger at those large @xmath5 values for which the integrand of ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) is still appreciable , then the value of the diffractive cross - section would be smaller .",
    "consequently , we multiply @xmath59 by a shifted gaussian : @xmath60 this form enables the width and height of the enhancement to be controlled independently while keeping a factor of close to unity at small @xmath5 .    the resulting behaviour of @xmath59 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:40.657.gr ] for the parameter values of our final fit i , described below .",
    "the behaviour at both small and large @xmath5-values is very similar to that suggested by a successful `` off - diagonal '' generalised vector dominance model  @xcite , where the probability distribution of scattering eigenstates exhibits peaks for cross - sections of hadronic size on an otherwise monotonic decrease with @xmath61  @xcite .      on refitting the data",
    ", we were able to adjust the ratio of diffractive to total cross - section for photoproduction to any reasonable value by adjusting the value of the saturation parameter @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , we fixed the value of the exponent @xmath63 to ensure reasonable agreement with the high energy real photoabsorption data points , which are of low statistical significance , as described below .",
    "two fits i and ii are reported here and summarised in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "they differ in that they give diffractive ratios at @xmath64 of 180 gev of 14% and 23% to agree to within 2% with zeus and h1 photoproduction values respectively .",
    "since the fits are similar , we shall concentrate on fit i , commenting briefly on the comparison with fit ii where appropriate .",
    "the quality of the fit is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:40.657.plot ] .",
    "the fit has a good @xmath50 but not so low as to indicate overfitting and the contribution from the very precise intermediate photoabsorption data is reasonably small . at high energies ,",
    "the photoabsorption total cross - section lies somewhat above the zeus point especially , even though the soft term @xmath29 exponent @xmath63 was given a slightly low value 0.06 compared to the canonical donnachie - landshoff  @xcite value of 0.08 to improve the agreement .",
    "however , these data values are low in comparison with a generalised vector dominance based extrapolation from low @xmath33 zeus data  @xcite .",
    "as regards the hard term , its @xmath29 exponent @xmath65 is consistent with the ` hard pomeron ' intercept of 1.418 obtained by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the ratio of diffractive to total cross - section are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:40.1054.825.dtot ] .",
    "as can be seen , there is little variation with @xmath33 , which accords with the @xmath33 independence of @xmath66 .",
    "the weak @xmath29 dependence is also in line with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the dipole cross - section resulting from fit i and its decomposition into hard and soft components are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:40.657.dcs ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:40.657.hs ] respectively .",
    "in addition , the contribution to the total photoabsorption cross - section arising from dipoles of different sizes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:40.1054.3p ] , showing that the dipole cross - section is essentially unconstrained by the data for dipole sizes above about 1.5 fm . below this the results accord",
    "well with reasonable physical expectations , with the soft pomeron dominating the large @xmath5/low @xmath38 behaviour and the hard pomeron dominating at low @xmath5/high @xmath38 when the energy is high enough .",
    "in addition , dipoles of order 1 fm have cross - sections commensurate with typical hadronic cross - sections .",
    "the precise value is sensitive to the diffractive ratio imposed in photoproduction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:40.825.657.comp ] , where the dipole cross - sections resulting from fit i ( with the zeus value imposed ) and fit ii ( with the h1 value imposed ) are compared .",
    "we have investigated the effect of including a charm contribution , assuming dipoles of the same transverse size have the same cross section irrespective of flavour .",
    "we have adopted a minimalist approach in assuming that the effect of charm flavour on the photon wave function occurs only through the charm mass , leaving the large @xmath5 peak , @xmath67 , for example , unchanged .",
    "this leads to an additional term for @xmath59 , of the same form as before but with @xmath68 appropriate to a charmed quark , and weighted @xmath69 in accordance with the squared charge coefficient of  ( [ eq : z_int ] ) .",
    "the extra term has the effect of increasing the small dipole flux at large @xmath33 .",
    "details of a fit ( fit iii ) which includes a contribution from charm with an assumed @xmath70 of 1.4 gev@xmath71 are given in table 3 .",
    "values in the perturbative region , which makes a choice of a running quark mass appropriate .",
    "the charm mass is estimated by the particle data group to lie in the range 1.1 to 1.4 gev.@xcite ] we have kept the same normalisation parameter @xmath62 as fit i to ensure the same diffractive ratio .",
    "a comparison of the resulting dipole cross section with that of fit i is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:41.914.40.1054.dcscomp ] .",
    "as might be expected , the hard term of the dipole cross section is suppressed , while the soft term is little affected .",
    "very little effect on the diffractive ratio is observed .",
    "a comparison of the predicted @xmath72 with data is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:41.914.f2cc ] showing broad agreement . to gauge the effect of increasing the charm mass",
    ", we compare predictions from a fit ( fit iv ) having a larger @xmath70 of 2.3 gev@xmath71 with the same data in fig .",
    "[ fig:41.1756.f2cc ] . within the limitations of the data ,",
    "the lower charm mass value is preferred .",
    "a number of other authors have attempted to determine the dipole proton cross - section.@xcite the closest in spirit to our approach is that of golec - biernat and wsthoff  @xcite , who achieve a good fit with a remarkably simple parameterisation of the dipole cross - section , which depends on @xmath5 and @xmath45 rather than @xmath5 and @xmath29 as here .",
    "their approach also differs from our own in two other ways .",
    "firstly , they do not fit the accurate photoproduction data , so that they are less sensitive to large dipoles and consequently to confinement effects ; and secondly they impose saturation at low @xmath45 ( or high @xmath29 ) as well as at large interquark separations .",
    "our own success in achieving a fit with no saturation in the energy variable indicates that the present data do not require it .",
    "we have succeeded in obtaining a fit to photoabsorption data with @xmath73 gev@xmath1 , including real photon data , using a parameterised form of the colour dipole cross - section .",
    "this has required modifying the effective photon wave function to take account of non - perturbative effects .",
    "the result is consistent with the cited experimental constraints from diffractive dissociation data .",
    "the next step is to develop the model so as to address the more detailed diffractive dissociation experimental data in the form of the @xmath74 structure function .",
    "also , we should include contributions from higher fock states , such as the @xmath75 , which will dominate at low @xmath76  @xcite",
    ".    we should also be able to apply our parameterisation to the prediction of both vector meson production and deeply virtual compton scattering cross - sections .",
