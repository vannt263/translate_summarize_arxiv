    "the morphology of galaxies has always been an attractive subject and has been investigated intensively through observational and theoretical approaches , due to both the beautiful shapes and richness of the complicated components in galaxies .",
    "in addition to normal spiral , elliptical , and irregular galaxies , those dominated by ring - like structures , i.e. ring galaxies , are one of the most intriguing categories of peculiar galaxies .",
    "ring galaxies , a peculiar class of galaxies , contain various ring - like structures with or without clumps , nuclei , companions , or spokes .",
    "for example , the famous cartwheel galaxy , first discovered by zwicky ( 1941 ) , shows an outer ring , an inner ring , a nucleus and spokes ( theys & spiegel 1976 ; fosbury & hawarden 1977 ; higdon 1995 ) .",
    "according to the morphology of ring galaxies , few & madore ( 1986 ) studied 69 ring galaxies in the southern hemisphere and developed a classification scheme .",
    "the ring galaxies are classified into two main classes : o - type and p - type galaxies .",
    "the o - type galaxies have a central nucleus and smooth regular ring , while p - type systems often contain an offset nucleus and a knotty ring .    as more and more observational data on ring galaxies have been obtained ( arp & madore 1987 ; bushouse & standford 1992 ; marston & appleton 1995 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 2006 ; madore et .",
    "2009 ) , three dominant theories have been proposed to explain the formation and evolution of ring galaxies : the collision scenario , the resonance scenario and the accretion scenario . in the collision scenario suggested by lynds & toomre ( 1976 ) ,",
    "ring galaxies are formed after a head - on collision between an intruder galaxy and a disk galaxy .",
    "the formation of the cartwheel galaxy is thought to be a prototype of this scenario .",
    "furthermore , from the observational statistics by few & madore ( 1986 ) , p - type galaxies have an excess of companions and can be considered as being formed by the collision scenario . in the resonance scenario ,",
    "ring - like patterns are formed by gas accumulation at lindblad resonances , which respond to external perturbations such as a bar or an oval .",
    "o - type galaxies , with a central nucleus and no obvious companions , are thought to experience the resonance formation process ( for instance , ic 4214 ( buta et",
    ". al . 1999 ) ) . the third scenario , accretion , was proposed to explain the origin of the polar ring galaxies .",
    "the polar ring galaxies contain a host galaxy and outer rings with gas and stars that orbit nearly perpendicular to the plane of the host galaxy .",
    "this type of galaxy is believed to be formed when the material from another galaxy or intergalactic medium is accreted onto the host galaxy .",
    "a possible prototype of this scenario is the formation of ngc 4650a ( bournaud & combes 2003 ) .",
    "on the other hand , elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) investigated 24 high redshift galaxies with rings or partial rings and fifteen bent chain galaxies in the gems ( galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ; rix et .",
    "al . 2004 ) and goods ( great observatories origins deep survey ; giavalisco et .",
    "al . 2004 ) fields .",
    "they found that several rings are symmetric with centered nuclei and no obvious companions .",
    "for example , one of interesting ring galaxies is combo-17 no.44999 , which has a bright knotty structure like p - type galaxies but does not have companions .",
    "the brightness at the center of the galaxy combo-17 no.44999 is comparable to that of the ring , so the densities at these two regions are similar . due to the lack of companions",
    ", it might be assumed they were formed through resonances .",
    "however , it is unclear whether there is any mechanism of resonances that could form these interesting rings because : ( 1 ) there is no obvious non - axisymmetric structure , i.e. bar or spiral , in these galaxies ; ( 2 ) the galaxy combo-17 no.44999 actually has a p - type property , i.e. knotty structures ; and ( 3 ) the densities at the ring regions are very high .",
    "therefore , the above controversial results in elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) encourage the study of p - type - like o - type ring galaxies or o - type - like p - type ring galaxies .",
    "in fact , the dynamical relations between companions and main galaxies for p - type ring galaxies might not always be obvious .",
    "those ring - structure - driving companions could have merged with the main galaxies and disappeared , and thus formed a p - type - like ring without companions .",
    "in contrast , the galaxies with axisymmetric rings might not have formed through the interactions with those obvious surrounding companions .",
    "they could have been formed through a head - on merger , in which the dwarf galaxy was destroyed and overlapped with the center of the main galaxy , forming an o - type ring .",
    "recently , madore et al . (",
    "2009 ) provided a new catalog of collisional ring galaxies .",
    "although these galaxies are classified as the p - type , we tried to find axis - symmetric ring systems with central nuclei in this catalog . in this study , we considered them as o - type - like collisional ring galaxies and investigated their formation history . due to these systems being axis - symmetric systems with non - offset central nuclei , head - on collisions by dwarf galaxies moving along the symmetric axis are considered to be standard models .",
    "the stellar components of dwarf galaxies will overlap with the central nucleus when the systems are viewed along the symmetric axes .",
    "those identified companions around the ring galaxy , as listed in the catalog , might not be the main drivers to produce these axis - symmetric rings .",
    "many interesting questions could be addressed for the above o - type - like collisional ring galaxies .",
    "could the standard models for head - on collisions explain these observed systems",
    "? how bright or strong are these observed rings ?",
    "when would rings start to form during the collisions ? how long could ring structures survive ? these were the main goals for investigation in this paper .",
    "in fact , as a first attack , struck ( 2010 ) used an analytic theory to study a number of systems in madore ( 2009 ) .",
    "none of the galaxies studied in that paper were studied in this paper . in order to provide more realistic models ,",
    "n - body simulations were used to study symmetric rings .",
    "the main differences between the proposed model and the one in struck ( 2010 ) are that : ( 1 ) impulse approximation is used in struck ( 2010 ) but not in this study ; ( 2 ) in this study , close encounters between the main galaxy and the dwarf galaxy could happen several times during one collisional event in the simulations , but the analytic model can not have this ; ( 3 ) the dwarf galaxy and the main galaxy actually gravitationally influence each other , but only the proposed model s simulations can show this self - consistently ; and ( 4 ) the dwarf galaxy finally merges and becomes part of the main disc galaxy , but the model in struck ( 2010 ) does not consider the contribution from the dwarf s stellar part .",
    "this study also developed a procedure to quantify the characteristics of rings , which is helpful for the study of the formation and evolution of rings . through the comparison between observational and simulation results , the age of rings",
    "could be estimated .",
    "the observational data of this study s o - type - like collisional ring galaxies are shown in section 2 , and the details of the models are shown in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the results of the collision simulations and the formation and evolution of rings are presented .",
    "the observation - simulation comparisons are presented in section 5 , the simulation of effect of the disc s length scale is in section 6 , and conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "madore ( 2009 ) presented a new catalog of 127 collisional ring galaxies , with plausible colliders identified around their central galaxy in the images . in order to study these systems , and in particular to investigate the relation between ring formation and the processes of galaxy - intruder collisions , all of the systems in the catalog were examined .",
    "as a first step , this study focused on symmetric cases ; therefore , systems with axis - symmetric rings were chosen . to make it easier to study ring structures , only systems where",
    "the identified colliders were not closely connected with the main galaxies were chosen , leaving 13 systems to study .",
    "finally , only those with known redshifts were used as sample systems in this paper .",
    "these final six systems are shown in fig .",
    "the images , redshifts and the spatial resolution were all obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/ ) .",
    "the redshifts are written in the upper left corner of each panel and the thick horizontal lines in the lower left corner represent 10 arcsec .",
    "the image data were taken in waveband heii ( @xmath0 = 468 nm ) using a uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) , which is a 1.2 meter schmidt telescope located at the siding spring observatory ( sso ) in australia .",
    "the ukst was operated by the royal observatory , edinburgh , from 1973 to 1988 , and became part of the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) thereafter .",
    "it has carried out many survey projects , for instance , the eso / serc southern sky survey , the h - alpha survey of the milky way and the magellanic clouds , and also 6df ( 6-degree field ) .",
    "for each image in fig .",
    "1 , as only the relative flux contrast was important for this study , the flux value , @xmath1 , in all pixels was linearly rescaled to be within the interval [ 0,1 ] , by multiplying a factor @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 were the minimum and maximum flux values in a particular image .    to determine the length scale of these ring galaxies , the spatial resolution of each pixel , kpc / pixel ,",
    "was calculated by the small - angle formula , where the angular size of each pixel was 1.7 arcsec .",
    "the distance to the galaxy , which was needed in the small - angle formula , was determined by the relativistic equation for the doppler shift and the hubble law with the hubble constant @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 ( spergel et al .",
    "thus , the distance to the galaxy , @xmath9 , was derived as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the redshift of the galaxy and @xmath12 is the speed of light .    in order to obtain the exact ring profiles of the above six galaxies , this study concentrated on the main regions with rings .",
    "fig.2 shows the flux - surface - density ( i.e. , flux per unit area ) plots around the area with ring regions .",
    "the center of each ring galaxy was at the origin ( 0,0 ) and the visible extent of the rings were within the boundaries of the plots .",
    "the flux - surface - density values were rescaled to be from 0 to 1 , using the same method as in fig . 1 .    using the numerical values of the plots shown in fig .",
    "2 , the surface density profile was produced as a function of distance @xmath13 . to do that , each pixel",
    "was assigned a space coordinate .",
    "the pixel where the center of each ring galaxy is located was set as the coordinate origin ( 0,0 ) .",
    "other pixels coordinates were set accordingly , for example , the coordinate of the pixel just to the left of the central pixel would be ( -1,0 ) . given that coordinate system , the distance @xmath14 from the origin to a particular pixel could be defined easily .",
    "the pixels belonging to the @xmath15th annulus would be those with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath14 is the pixel s distance to the origin .",
    "then , the flux - surface - density of all the pixels belong to the @xmath15th annulus would be summed as the total flux - surface - density @xmath18 .",
    "the flux - surface - density , @xmath19 , of each annulus was defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total number of pixels belonging to this annulus .",
    "this study calculated @xmath19 for all annuli and rescaled it to be within the [ 0,1 ] interval .",
    "the data points shown in fig.3 give the resulting density profiles .",
    "to obtain an analytic curve to fit the above surface density profile , this study first integrated the three - dimensional mass density profile of the stellar disc in hernquist ( 1993 ) to yield the surface density profile as : @xmath22    it was then modified to be : @xmath23 where two additional fitting parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , were introduced .",
    "the best - fitting parameter set @xmath26 was determined by minimizing @xmath27 ( wall & jenkins 2003 ) as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the surface density at a radius @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the @xmath32 with the fitting parameter set @xmath26 .    in the left panels of fig .",

    "the density contrast was defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the difference between the surface density and the best - fitting profile at a radius r , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "fig.3(b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) show the density contrast as a function of radius @xmath13 for the ring galaxies",
    ". these three panels showed that the location of the inner ring structure for these six ring galaxies was from 4 kpc to 20 kpc , and the density contrast of the inner ring was from 0.09 to 0.9 .",
    "in the simulations , the target and the intruder were assumed to be a disc galaxy and a dwarf galaxy respectively , in order to investigate the response of collisions between a target disc galaxy , consisting of the stellar disc and the dark matter halo , and a less massive dwarf galaxy , containing the dark matter halo and the stellar component . in order to study the effect of the intruder s mass ,",
    "two dwarf galaxy models were set up , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 .      in the simulations ,",
    "the unit of length was 1 kpc , the unit of mass was @xmath44 , the unit of time was @xmath45 years , and the gravitational constant @xmath46 was 43007.1 .",
    "both the stellar disc and the dark matter halo of the target galaxy followed the profiles employed in hernquist ( 1993 ) .",
    "the density profile of the stellar disc was : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the disc mass , @xmath49 is the radial scale length and @xmath50 is the vertical scale length .",
    "furthermore , the halo density profile was : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the halo mass , @xmath53 is the tidal radius , and @xmath54 is the core radius .",

    "the intruder dwarf galaxy was comprised of the dark matter halo and a stellar part with plummer spheres ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; read et .",
    "al . 2006 ) , as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mass and scale length of each component .",
    "the initial positions of the particles could be easily determined according to the above given density profiles .",
    "the initial velocities were assigned to particles through the methods described in wu & jiang ( 2009 ) .",
    "the simulations were carried out with the parallel tree - code gadget ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) , and the softening lengths were set as 0.05 kpc , 0.03 kpc and 0.035 kpc for the target disc galaxy , the dwarf galaxy @xmath42 and the dwarf galaxy @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "three model galaxies were needed in the simulations , including the disc galaxy and the dwarf galaxies @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the mass and scale of the disc galaxy were chosen to be those of a standard spiral galaxy , such as the milky way , using the details from hernquist ( 1993 ) . using the chosen units , for the disc galaxy , the disc mass , @xmath48 , was 5.6 , the disc radial scale length , @xmath62 , was 3.5 , the disc vertical scale length , @xmath63 , was 0.7 , the halo mass , @xmath52 , was 32.48 , the halo core radius , @xmath54 , was 3.5 and the halo tidal radius , @xmath53 , was 35.0 .",
    "the disc galaxy had a total of 340,000 particles , i.e. 290,000 dark matter particles and 50,000 stellar particles in the disc .",
    "the above parameters values are summarized in table 1 .    .",
    "model parameters of the disc galaxy . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the best - fitting density profiles are shown in fig.[fig13 ] , where the solid curves with full circles are the observational data , and the dotted curves with empty circles are the simulations .",
    "it was found that the simulations could produce general trends of these profiles for the first five galaxies in fig.[fig13](a)-(e ) .",
    "particularly , the simulation and observational profiles were very close for the galaxy am 1413 - 243 as shown in fig.[fig13](d ) .",
    "the six best snapshots listed in table 4 are plotted in fig.[fig14 ] .",
    "the above results showed that the head - on penetrations in simulations s1-s4 could explain the first five o - type - like collisional ring galaxies found from madore et al .",
    "for the sixth one , arp 318 , the major difference was that the central part was very big and extended to a much larger radius .",
    "the simulation profile dropped and could not fit the observed flat feature . in next section ,",
    "a simulation is introduced , in which the disc s length scale is doubled .",
    "the purpose was to see if the larger disc could produce a bigger central part with a flat density profile , as well as to study the effect of different initial conditions for the major galaxy .",
    "in s1-s4 , this study mainly explored the effects of mass ratios and relative velocities between two merging galaxies .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether the ring evolution presented here depended on the initial conditions of the primary galaxy . for example , for the work about galactic discs , chakrabarti & blitz ( 2009 ) and chakrabarti et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that disturbances in outer gas discs can be used to characterize galactic satellites , and that these disturbances are not extremely sensitive to the assumed initial conditions of the primary galaxies .    in order to obtain a better model for the galaxy arp 318 ,",
    "a primary galaxy with a larger length scale is used in the simulation presented here .",
    "the disc galaxy was set up using the same method as described in section 3 , except that the radial scale length @xmath64 was 7 kpc , which was two times the radial scale length of the main disc galaxy in s1-s4 .",
    "after an initial relaxation of 15 dynamical time , this disc galaxy approached a new equilibrium and was used as the target galaxy in the merging simulation .    because s3 provided the best fit to one of the o - type - like collisional galaxies described in the last section , all the model setting and details in this simulation were the same as s3 , except for the length scale of the primary galaxy .",
    "that is , dwarf galaxy model @xmath43 was employed as the intruder , the initial separation was 200 kpc , and the initial relative velocity was 135.7 km / s .",
    "the results of ring evolution are shown in fig.[fig15 ] .",
    "it was found that the general evolution process was very similar with the one in s3 , as there were also three ring generations .",
    "the locations and widths of the rings were also similar with those in s3 .",
    "the main difference was that the density contrast was smaller in this simulation .",
    "this could be because the disc had a larger length scale , so the amplitudes of any density disturbance became smaller .",
    "all snapshots of this simulation were also compared with the six observational galaxies through the same procedure described in the last section .",
    "finally , it was confirmed that none of the snapshots in this simulation provided a better fit to any of the six observational galaxies , including arp 318 .",
    "motivated by the results in elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) , this study found six axis - symmetric rings with central nuclei from the new catalog of collisional ring galaxies in madore et al.(2009 ) , and presented their structures , profiles , and density contrasts .",
    "they were o - type - like collisional ring galaxies , and their possible formation scenario was addressed in this paper .",
    "head - on collisions by dwarf galaxies moving along the symmetric axis were considered , and n - body simulations were used to investigate the evolutionary process . it was found that the simulations with smaller initial relative velocities between two galaxies or the cases with heavier dwarf galaxies could produce rings with higher density contrasts . usually , there were more than one generation of rings in any of the simulations .",
    "the lifetime of any generation of rings was about one dynamical time , and the rings continued moving outward with constant velocities until they disappeared at the outer part of the galactic discs .    through the observation - simulation comparison shown in fig.[fig13 ] , this study concluded that head - on penetrations could explain these low density contrast ring galaxies .",
    "moreover , it was found that the simulation rings that resemble the observational o - type - like collisional rings were those at the early stage of one of the ring - generations .",
