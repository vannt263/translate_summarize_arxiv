    "scalar fields coupled to matter are generic predictions of many theories of high energy physics . in recent years",
    ", this idea has attracted a lot of attention in the context of dark energy @xcite , which is believed to be a scalar field or one of its variants @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that if a scalar field couples to matter or curvature then a scalar fifth force and a modification to the gravitational law could result .",
    "such new physics has been strongly constrained by local gravity experiments and solar system tests , so that fifth forces and modifications of gravity must been either very short - ranged or very weak , or both .",
    "if this is true , then the effect of the scalar field is mainly to drive the accelerating expansion of the universe , such as in the quintessence model @xcite .",
    "more cosmologically interesting models could be built if the fifth force or modification to the standard einstein gravity is only weak and/or short ranged where local experiments are performed , such as in our solar system where matter density is high and gravity is strong , but could become strong ( of gravitational strength ) and long - ranged elsewhere . over the past few years , several models have been proposed to realise this , including the chameleon model @xcite , the environmentally - dependent dilaton model @xcite , the dgp model @xcite , the galileon model @xcite and the symmetron model @xcite .",
    "although all these models predict strong environmental dependence of the fifth force , they work in very different ways . in the chameleon model , for example , the fifth force is suppressed exponentially in high density regions where the scalar field acquires a heavy mass via its coupling to matter .",
    "the environmentally dependent dilaton model , on the other hand , drives the scalar field to some critical value @xmath0 in high density regions , which corresponds to a vanishing coupling and therefore vanishing fifth force ( though the mass of the scalar field depends on the local matter density as well in this model ) .    the symmetron model , which is the topic of this work , relies on a similar mechanism to suppress the fifth force in high density regions . here ,",
    "when the matter density is high enough , the effective potential of the scalar field has a global minimum at the origin , which corresponds to a vanishing coupling to matter .",
    "when matter density drops below some critical value , the symmetry in the effective potential is broken and two local minima develop and move away from the origin , corresponding to a nonzero coupling to matter and thus a non - vanishing fifth force .",
    "if later the matter density inside a region becomes high again due to the structure formation process ( such as in galaxies and galaxy clusters ) , the symmetry of the effective potential could be restored and the fifth force vanishes again for that region .",
    "local experiments could constrain the parameters of the symmetron model . interestingly , in this constrained parameter space , there are still models which could deviate from the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology on large scales .",
    "the cosmological observables , in particular those relevant for the large scale structure formation , can thus provide valuable information about the symmetron , such as whether it exists , what its observational signatures are , how to differentiate it from other models , etc . in this work",
    ", we shall concentrate on the structure formation of the symmetron model in the linear perturbation regime , and show how the symmetron can affect the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : we first briefly overview the symmetron model and how the local tests constrain its parameters in sects .",
    "[ subsect : model ] and [ subsect : localtest ] , followed by analytical and numerical study of the background cosmology in the model ( sect .",

    "[ sect : linpert_general ] we study the general behaviour of the linear perturbations in this model , where we show that the fifth force essentially enhances gravity within its range ( given by the comoving compton length of the symmetron field ) and keeps standard gravity unmodified beyond that range .",

    "most of the sub - horizon scales are in the non - tachyonic regime while the symmetron field oscillates around the ( moving ) minimum of the effective potential .",

    "local tests of gravity only constrain @xmath341 which sets the spatial scale below which the modification of gravity is apparent .",
    "it is clear from the figures that there are regions of the allowed parameter space where the modifications to gravity are potentially large .",
    "however , with @xmath342 , modification to structure formation occur on and below mpc scales , and on these scales the linear perturbation approximation breaks down at late times . as with the environmentally dependent dilaton model @xcite",
    ", we expect the onset of nonlinear structure to suppress the fifth force giving a weaker observational signal , and this is confirmed in @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the dilaton model , the redshift at which gravity deviates from gr , @xmath261 , is a free parameter and if this occurs early enough then structure will still be linear on mpc scales and the linearised approximation will hold and non - negligible changes to structure formation could occur",
    ". we will consider possible observational constraints in the future .",
    "in this paper we have studied the background cosmology and the evolution of linear perturbations for the symmetron model .",
    "the model utilises the so - called symmetron mechanism to suppress the fifth force mediated by the scalar symmetron field in regions with high matter density to evade the local gravity constraints . in the regions with low matter density ,",
    "the fifth force is unsuppressed , which could have significant consequences on the cosmic structure formation .",
    "the symmetron mechanism works because the effective potential @xmath132 , which governs the evolution of @xmath5 , depends explicitly on the local matter density .",
    "if the matter density is high , the potential has a global minimum at @xmath41 about which it is symmetric ; then because the coupling strength of the symmetron field to matter is proportional to @xmath5 , the coupling vanishes and so does the fifth force .",
    "when the matter density drops below some critical value @xmath48 , the symmetry of the potential is broken and the minimum of @xmath112 moves aways from @xmath41 ; because the scalar field tries to track that minimum , the coupling becomes nonzero and so does the fifth force .",
    "when inhomogeneous matter distribution is considered , it is possible that the symmetry in @xmath112 is broken in a region , but later the matter density in that region exceeds @xmath48 again because of the structure formation process , and the symmetry is restored so that the fifth force vanishes again .",
    "obviously such a phenomenon is quite nontrivial to study .",
    "we have studied the behaviour of the symmetron field in background cosmology , when the symmetry breaking happens in the matter dominated era .",
    "we have found that immediately after the symmetry breaking , the symmetron field lags behind its effective potential minimum and therefore has a negative mass - squared .",
    "this implies that it will experience a tachyonic period during which both the field and its perturbation grow exponentially .",
    "however this period is fairly short and the symmetron field will then quickly settle down to the ( moving ) minimum of @xmath112 , where it oscillates .",
    "we find analytical solutions to these different phases and show that they agree quite well with numerical results .",
    "we have then investigated the general behaviour of the linear perturbations in the symmetron model .",
    "the symmetron perturbations have an effective mass - squared @xmath343 , in which @xmath189 is the wavenumber of the perturbation and @xmath344 is the mass of the background symmetron field . on very small scales , @xmath345 even if @xmath346 , and there is no tachyonic instability .",
    "in this case we notice that the growth of matter perturbation is governed by an enhanced newton constant which is @xmath347 when the size of the perturbation is smaller than the compton radius of the symmetron field ( which means that the perturbation is within the reach of the fifth force ) , while it is the same as in gr if the perturbation is bigger than the compton radius .    on larger scales",
    "it is possible that @xmath348 given that @xmath346 and the symmetron perturbation will experience the tachyonic growth , which naively could be a problem as it would mean that everything blows up .",
    "we find , however , that the tachyonic behaviour does not affect the growth of matter perturbation significantly , at least on sub - horizon scales .",
    "the reason is that the tachyonic period is so short that the even faster growth of @xmath5 itself has negligible effect in cosmology , let alone that of @xmath186 .",
    "this conclusion has been confirmed by our numerical results .",
    "finally , we have studied the structure formation in the linear regime under the adiabatic approximation , i.e. , assuming that the scalar field always tracks the minimum of its effective potential .",
    "our result shows that , depending on the redshift @xmath97 of the symmetry breaking , the effect of the fifth force on the large - scale structure could be important .",
    "if @xmath97 is big , then the symmetry breaking happens at earlier times when the matter perturbations are well described by the linear theory and our analysis gives accurate result . in such cases",
    "we find that the fifth force comes into effect fairly early and we expect bigger deviations from the @xmath1cdm model predictions .",
    "if @xmath97 is small , then the fifth force takes effect quite late , when matter perturbations have already entered the nonlinear regime . in such cases the linear theory is no longer accurate and better results can only be obtained using nonlinear numerical simulations @xcite .    to summarise",
    ", the symmetron mechanism is shown to work very successfully to suppress the fifth force to an undetectable level in our solar system , while still allow non - negligible effects to be found in the cosmological structure formation process .",
    "this is very important for the study of dark energy , because it means that one has to look at the small scales ( relevant for galaxies and galaxy clusters ) to find the implications of a theory which is supposed to modify cosmology on the very largest scales .",
