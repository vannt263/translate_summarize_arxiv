    "massive black hole binaries ( hereafter mbhbs ) may form as a result of several processes : through the breakup of a supermassive protostar @xcite , as a meta - stable state in the evolution of a cluster of massive objects @xcite , and as a result of galactic mergers @xcite .",
    "the last mechanism is a major formation route for mbhbs and it relies on hierarchical merger models of galaxy formation @xcite and significant dynamical evidence that the majority of galaxies harbor massive black holes in their centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we investigate observational signatures of mbhbs that result from galactic mergers .",
    "theoretical results imply that the evolution of a mbhb proceeds in three stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the binary separation decreases through the process of dynamical friction when stars in the nuclear region are scattered by the binary . in the third stage , binary orbital angular momentum",
    "is efficiently dissipated via gravitational radiation emission and the binary proceeds to an inevitable merger .",
    "a possibility that in the second stage of evolution the binary merger stalls because of depletion of stars in the nuclear region , is still a topic of a lively scientific debate @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , binaries spend most of their lifetime at separations of @xmath1pc @xcite and the majority of observed binaries should be found in this evolutionary stage .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this , second evolutionary stage in the life of a binary , as to _ intermediate phase_.    a number of authors have suggested that interaction of a binary with a gaseous accretion disk may have significant effects on the inspiral and merger rates of mbhb @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that massive gas disks tend to form in centers of merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "in particular , a gas disk may expedite the merger of a binary by dissipation of orbital angular momentum @xcite , reducing the merger time to @xmath2yr .",
    "observationally , mbhbs may be identified directly in cases when a black hole pair is spatially resolved and when the separation and kinematic parameters point to a close , bound pair . in practice",
    ", there is only one such object identified so far : observations of ngc  6240 , an ultra luminous infrared galaxy , with the @xmath3 x - ray observatory revealed a merging pair of x - ray active nuclei with a separation of 1.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite also reported on the x - ray detection of a wide , proto supermassive binary black hole at the center of cluster abell  400 .",
    "practical obstacles in this type of direct identification arise for several reasons .",
    "firstly , fairly high spatial resolution and accuracy in position measurements are required to resolve a binary active nucleus .",
    "the spatial resolution required to resolve an intermediate binary with orbital separation of 1pc at the distance of @xmath4100@xmath5mpc is about 2@xmath5mas . with spatial resolutions currently achievable ,",
    "it is easier to spot and resolve wide binaries , like ngc  6240 , whereas it has been suggested that mbhbs spend a major fraction of their life time as intermediate , hard binaries @xcite . because of their high spatial resolution vlba and vlbi radio observatories have a large potential for discovery of close binaries with separations of 0.1@xmath610  pc , especially when combined with ground - based optical spectroscopic observations @xcite .    the second most appealing piece of observational evidence for a mbhb would be a periodic manifestation of keplerian motion .",
    "there are a handful of galaxies which exhibit periodicities in their light curves and thus can be considered as mbhb candidates @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is the blazar oj  287 which exhibits outburst activity in the optical light curve with a period close to 12 years .",
    "the latest outburst of oj  287 , expected at the end of 2006 , has not yet happened , putting to the test a number of models along with the binary hypothesis @xcite .",
    "another phenomenon associated with the existence of a mbhb is the change in the orientation of the black hole spin axis and its precession about the total angular momentum axis , caused by its interaction with another black hole @xcite .",
    "this effect is one possible explanation for helical radio - jets , x - shaped , and s - shaped radio - jets , observed in some galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though alternative explanations are available @xcite . in cases",
    "when the orbit of the less massive , inspiralling black hole becomes coplanar with an accretion disk of the primary , fueling of jets may be interrupted and re - started @xcite .",
    "this could give rise to a second pair of jets aligned along the same axis with the initial pair , as seen in double - double radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "massive binary black holes may also influence the kinematics of the broad line region of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) which could be detected in periodic variations of broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that double peaked emission lines originate in binary broad line regions . in this scenario",
    "periodic velocity shifts of each peak in the line profile should reflect the orbital motion of a single broad line region associated with one of the black holes .",
    "after extensive spectroscopic monitoring of mbhb candidates spanning two decades the predicted long term periodic variability was not confirmed , leaving little room for a binary broad line region scenario @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that perturbation of a single broad - line region by a second mbh is still an open possibility , and in fact the only good interpretation for some objects .",
    "another version of this hypothesis in which the secondary black hole perturbs the broad line region of the primary was offered by @xcite as an explanation of the variable fe k@xmath0 line in 3c  273 .",
    "@xcite suggest that characteristic spiral arm morphology can arise within the inner @xmath7 kpc of a gas disk as a consequence of perturbations in a binary potential , and that in the absence of more direct techniques , this signature may be used for a mbhb search .",
    "another , soon - to - be - opened observational window should allow detection of gravitational waves from mbhbs @xcite .",
    "these are expected to be an important class of sources for the laser interferometer space antenna , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "since it is not clear which model should be used to describe the optical data ( binary orbital motion or disk and jet precession ) , the masses of current candidate binary systems are highly uncertain .",
    "the future data from gravitational radiation observations , combined with information on optical counterparts , should play an important role in determining the most likely scenario @xcite . in a broader sense ,",
    "once enough information about the statistical properties of such binaries is available , it should be possible to constrain the merger rates and merger histories of massive and supermassive black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "for this reason a large scientific effort has been recently directed towards understanding the electromagnetic signatures in different pre - merger and post - merger phases of mbhbs @xcite .",
    "the work we present in this paper fits within this broader context .    in  [ s_binary_simulations ]",
    "we present our method for calculation of emission signatures of mbhbs .",
    "the results are described in  [ s_results ] , the discussion and future prospects in ",
    "[ s_discussion ] , and in  [ s_conclusions ]",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "we have carried out smoothed particle hydrodynamical ( sph ) simulations of the binary and a gaseous component , and we have characterized the physical properties of the gas by calculating heating , cooling , and radiative processes as an integral part of simulations . based on these results",
    "we have calculated the accretion - powered continuum and h@xmath0 light curves , as well as the h@xmath0 emission line profiles emerging from the inner parts of a gas disk on a scale of @xmath9 pc .",
    "for the first time we attempt to model both gas and binary dynamics in the nuclear region on sub - parsec scales in order to bridge the gap between large scale hydrodynamic simulations of merging galaxies and numerical relativity simulations of the late , pre - coalescence evolutionary phase in the life of a binary . the binary - gas evolution in simulations of merging galaxies has been followed down to separations of @xmath10 pc @xcite .",
    "the simulations that reach even smaller separations are computationally expensive , mostly because they need to be carried out at high resolution in force ( or equivalently time ) .",
    "additionally , if the nuclear processes followed include accretion , then a high resolution in mass is desired as well .",
    "these requirements are combined with the wide spatial and temporal dynamic range set by the nature of the problem itself . for",
    "the above reasons , in our simulations we focus on the length scale occupied by a nuclear accretion disk and do not consider the disk structure on larger scales .",
    "we have used a modified version of _ gadget _ @xcite to carry out the mbhb simulations .",
    "_ gadget _ is a code for collisionless and gas - dynamical cosmological simulations .",
    "it evolves self - gravitating collisionless fluids with a tree @xmath11-body approach , and collisional gas by sph .",
    "_ gadget _ was not originally intended to carry out relativistic calculations . for this reason we have performed several modifications to the code in order to treat the two massive black holes relativistically .",
    "we have introduced the black hole particles as collisionless massive particles with pseudo - newtonian potentials .",
    "the calculations with a pseudo - newtonian potential account for the decay of a black hole binary orbit through emission of gravitational radiation (  [ s_orbits ] ) .",
    "the gravitational drag from gas particles on the two black holes is accounted for through a contribution from every gas particle to each black hole s acceleration .",
    "we set up the two schwarzschild black holes as sink particles and model the accretion rate of gas and resulting accretion luminosity .",
    "the approach in which a black hole is treated as a sink particle has been introduced before in simulations of star formation @xcite and accretion onto supermassive black holes @xcite . in our model , a particle is considered to contribute to the unresolved accretion flow near a black hole once it crosses the hole s accretion radius , r@xmath12 .",
    "r@xmath12 is set to a fiducial value of 20  @xmath13 , comparable to the smallest length scale resolved in the simulation ( i.e. , the smoothing length of particles in a region of high density , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the mass of a black hole ) . once the gas particles find themselves within r@xmath12 their dynamics is not temporally resolved .",
    "this choice allows to avoid a simulation hang - up when the integration time step of such particles becomes very small .",
    "we introduce a numerical approximation in the calculation of the accretion rate in order to account for the fact that the unresolved accretion flow of particles inside r@xmath12 radius is noisy and that their dynamics can not be described by the model of a steady accretion disk .",
    "because of the short dynamical time associated with the innermost region of the accretion disk the particles there respond quickly to the variable potential of the binary which causes the streams of gas to collide and intersect with each other . from the total amount of gas that crosses r@xmath12 in given time @xmath17",
    ", only a fraction of the gas will be accreted , while the rest will gain enough momentum to avoid accretion onto the black hole . the accretion rate of a noisy flow of particles across some radius @xmath18 is in general case proportional to the surface area , @xmath19 , assuming the planar and uniform distribution of particles within @xmath18 .",
    "we calculate from the simulations the rate with which particles cross r@xmath12 and extrapolate from it the accretion rate of particles that would have crossed the schwarzschild radius as @xmath20 .",
    "the estimate obtained in such way is conservative as we do not take into account the gravitational focusing by the black holes , which would increase the flow of particles towards the black holes and thus , their accretion rates . in   [ s_discussion ] , we discuss the effect of our assumptions about the accretion model on the observational signatures .",
    "the viscosity is parametrized in numerical calculations in order to account for the transfer of momentum and angular momentum without detailed assumptions about the nature of the phenomenon .",
    "one widely used parametrization is based on the shakura - sunyaev model @xcite , where the @xmath0-parameter takes values less than 1.0 , and typically @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite for example find @xmath22 , for accretion disks in agn , based on the observed continuum variability . finding a suitable parametric description for the viscosity in sph calculations which would faithfully describe the angular momentum transfer in different physical regimes has been a major issue over many years @xcite .",
    "a notable improvement in the treatment of viscosity was offered by parametrization that perform better in conserving the entropy of a simulated system ( e.g. , _ in gadget-2 _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "although we have used the version of _ gadget _ released earlier @xcite , for the purposes of our calculations we adopted the viscosity prescription given in the new version of the code , _",
    "gadget-2_. the physical properties in our simulations that are directly affected by this choice are the accretion rate of gas onto black holes and the internal energy of the gas @xmath6 both of which play very important roles in the observational appearance of the system .",
    "we derive the value of the artificial viscosity parameter used in the code , @xmath23 in such way that it corresponds to the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath24 .",
    "we note that this relation is only a convenient way of describing the viscosity numerically and should not be interpreted as a statement about the physical viscosity in the disk . in sph simulations , the viscosity acts as an excess pressure which is assigned to particles in the equation of motion , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the speed of sound and @xmath27 is the relative velocity of the two approaching particles .",
    "we compare this to the shakura - sunyaev tangential stress component @xmath28 , and obtain a local relation between the parameters describing a single particle interaction @xmath29 the resulting artificial viscosity as described by equation  ( [ eq_visc_micro ] ) does not explicitly depend on the density of gas particles .",
    "however , in simulations a major increase in internal energy due to viscous dissipation occurs in high density regions which are conducive to high rate of particle interactions ( i.e. , collisions ) .",
    "the implication is that the relation connecting the two viscosity parameters depends on the density of gas particles in a simulation , namely , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density distribution of gas particles and @xmath32 is the value of the density at the inner radius of the accretion disk . assuming that the largest value that @xmath27 can take is of the order of particle orbital velocities one can find a value of @xmath23 which corresponds to some value of the shakura - sunyaev @xmath0 . from equation  ( [ eq_visc_macro ] ) we find that in order to have @xmath33 , at radial distances @xmath34 from a black hole , in a disk where @xmath35 , we have to choose @xmath36 .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath37 as the radius in units of gravitational radii ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we choose a pseudo - newtonian paczynsky - wiita potential @xcite to describe the potentials of massive black holes in our calculations @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the two black holes can initially be placed on circular or elliptical orbits .",
    "the properties of circular orbits in the paczynsky - wiita potential are described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we derive expressions for the orbital velocity of a test particle on an elliptical orbit in the paczynsky - wiita potential in order to assign initial velocities consistent with the potential .",
    "we adopt the reduced two - body problem parametrization where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where the energy and angular momentum of a system are calculated with respect to its center of mass ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 are masses of the two black holes ) .",
    "we start with the requirement that in the paczynsky - wiita potential , the total energy and orbital angular momentum at the pericenter and apocenter of the orbit are equal .",
    "this leads to the following conditions : @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the velocity and radial distance of the reduced mass body , @xmath51 , at the pericenter and apocenter , respectively . from equations  ( [ eq_energy ] ) and ( [ eq_momentum ] )",
    "we derive the velocity at the pericenter as @xmath52 from the expression for the orbital angular momentum , @xmath53 ( where @xmath18 is the radial distance of the reduced mass from the center of mass of the system , and @xmath54 is its true anomaly ) , we find the angular azimuthal velocity .",
    "@xmath55 we derive the radial velocity component from the equation of an ellipse , @xmath56 , @xmath57 using the equation  ( [ eq_velperi ] ) and the condition @xmath58 we find the _ vis viva _ expression for an elliptical orbit in the paczynsky - wiita potential to be @xmath59 as the binary orbits in paczynsky - wiita potential it loses a fraction of its energy and orbital angular momentum through gravitational wave emission .",
    "we assume that as the binary contracts by emission of gravitational waves , the two black holes remain on elliptical orbits .",
    "this assumption is justified in our simulations where the total mass of the gas in a simulation is much smaller than the mass of a binary .",
    "consequently , the perturbations of the elliptical orbits of black holes by the underlying gas distribution are small .    following @xcite we calculate the rate of the energy loss to gravitational radiation using the quadrupole approximation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the orbital frequency in the paczynsky - wiita potential . from this equation",
    "it is possible to obtain the radiation reaction acceleration at the center of mass frame of the binary ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) @xmath62 chosen so as to preserve the symmetry of forces acting on each member of the system .",
    "this requirement ensures that the total momentum of the system is conserved while the individual components recoil due to the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "we have investigated two different scenarios for radiative heating and cooling , assuming the emitting gas can be described as a black - body ( bb ) or a solar metallicity gas .",
    "the option for radiative heating and cooling of hydrogen - helium gas is also implemented in the code , following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but was not used in the runs reported here .",
    "the cooling scenarios are mutually exclusive and by comparing them one can study the importance and impact of various cooling mechanisms in our simulations . in our simulations , the gas is heated by shocks and `` external '' sources of illumination .",
    "we assume that the sources of illumination are powered by accretion onto the massive black holes .",
    "after accretion on either of the two black holes becomes significant , uv and soft x - ray radiation emitted from the innermost portion of the accretion flow photo - ionizes the gas .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of an accretion - powered source of ionizing radiation can be written as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the assumed radiative efficiency , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the mass and particle accretion rates , respectively , and @xmath67 is the mass of a gas particle .    1 .   _ black - body case . _",
    "+ in this scenario , the illuminated gas absorbs and emits the radiation as a black - body .",
    "each gas particle is therefore treated as an optically thick cell of gas , in local thermal equilibrium within a radius equal to its smoothing length , @xmath68 .",
    "a fraction of the incident energy absorbed by the gas depends on a coverage factor of the gas @xmath69 , i.e. , the fraction of solid angle covered by gas , as seen from the position of a source , and the distance of an absorbing gas cell from the source , @xmath18 . from our simulations",
    "we find @xmath70 , corresponding to a fraction of particles exposed to illumination from an external source at any given time .",
    "we do not take into account radiation pressure , i.e. , the momentum that is transferred to the gas particles by the incident radiation .",
    "we write the expression for the heating rate of the gas per unit volume as @xmath71 here we assume that @xmath72 is the portion of the accretion luminosity carried by ionizing photons ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the black - body cooling rate per unit volume is evaluated from the stefan - boltzmann equation and it can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",

    "spectroscopic observations of agn show a wide range of metal absorption and emission lines , implying that most agn systems are metal - rich .",
    "additionally , metals are important coolants under the physical conditions typically found in agn broad line regions .",
    "therefore , in order to correctly model and describe these systems it is necessary to also include metals as constituents of the gas .",
    "however , detailed calculations of radiative transfer , coupled with parallel hydrodynamic simulations present a large computational challenge and are currently not possible . including metals in heating and cooling calculations results in a large network of equations , especially if non - lte processes are included .",
    "the solution of the heating and cooling equations dominates the cpu usage in a parallel hydrodynamics code to the extent that the calculation becomes prohibitively expensive .",
    "+ here we describe the approximate method we used for calculation of heating and cooling of the gas with metals .",
    "we have constructed a number of cooling maps using the photoionization code _ cloudy _",
    "since the maps are used in computationally expensive numerical calculations , it is impractical to call _ cloudy _ every time a cooling rate is needed .",
    "instead , we pre - calculate a grid of cooling maps over a wide range of parameters , where the range of parameters has been determined from preliminary calculations without cooling .",
    "the parameter grid is read in by the simulation code , and radiative heating and cooling rates are linearly interpolated from the existing grid points .",

    "the range of parameter values for which the maps were computed is as follows : @xmath76 , @xmath77k , and @xmath78 .",
    "because one of the assumptions in _ cloudy _ is that the electrons are non - relativistic , the present range of its validity extends to temperatures below roughly @xmath79 k. gas at higher temperatures than this is commonly encountered in our simulations ; in such cases we calculate heating and cooling rates by linearly extrapolating the grid values . in the sph simulations we set the lower threshold for the gas temperature to 100  k and assign no upper threshold .",
    "the calculation in _ cloudy _ is explicitly one dimensional , with results depending only on the depth coordinate .",
    "propagation of line photons is conducted using the escape probability approximation . in this approach",
    "the escape probability for a photon is calculated under the assumption that the difference between the mean intensity averaged over the line and the source function at some location in the emitter is due to photons leaking away from the region @xcite .",

    "when information about the cooling rate per unit volume , @xmath90 , is obtained for every gas particle @xmath91 in the simulation , their internal energy is modified accordingly .",
    "thus , the heating and cooling are directly coupled with the evolution of the physical conditions in the gas .",
    "the total cooling rate from the gas ( i.e. , the bolometric luminosity ) is obtained by summing over all particles , @xmath92 .",
    "we do not assume that the gas is in thermal equilibrium , and consequently cooling is not necessarily balanced by heating .",

    "the emissivity of the photoionized gas depends on numerous physical parameters .",
    "locally , it depends on the physical properties of gas .",
    "globally , its spatial distribution depends on the structure and morphology of the accretion disk .",
    "the h@xmath0 emissivity can be most accurately assessed with photoionization calculations , thus we used this approach in the case of a _ solar metallicity gas_.    in cases when photoionization calculations are not available , the emissivity is often parametrized as a function of radius , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "this is justified by the photoionization calculations of @xcite , which suggest that the emitted h@xmath0 flux is approximately proportional to the incident continuum flux for a wide range of values of the density and column density .",
    "we have compared the emissivity determined from our own photoionization calculations with the parametric model ( figure  [ fig_haemiss ] ) and found a qualitative agreement between the two .",
    "we also notice a significant amount of scatter in the emissivity values from the photoionization calculation , which is expected due to variations in surface density of the perturbed gas disk in our model .",
    "once the surface emissivity of each gas cell in the simulation is known , the h@xmath0 luminosity can be expressed as @xmath104 , where @xmath91 is a particle index .",
    "the implicit assumption , following from the above luminosity expression , is that the gas is optically thin to h@xmath0 photons .",

    "when the gas is exposed to an intense ionizing continuum , the optical depth to the h@xmath0 photons increases significantly because many hydrogen atoms are in the first excited energy state .",
    "however , in our profile calculations we do not correct for the absorption of the h@xmath0 photons by the gas .",

    "the physical properties of the disk remain stable and do not change over a considerable period of simulation time , until the secondary black hole plunges into it .",
    "this is an indication that the disk has settled into a quasi - steady state and that any further physical changes can be attributed to the interactions with the binary .    the tidal perturbation by the secondary causes the disk to become eccentric and develop a spiral pattern , even before the secondary plunges into it . the physical properties of the disk are significantly altered after the plunge , which occurs @xmath155 years after the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the secondary forms a shock where the temperature persists at @xmath116 k. while in this model the cooling of the gas is less efficient , there is no doubt that the shock has formed and that it trails behind the secondary as it travels through the disk .    in our model ,",
    "a source of illumination is assumed to turn on once the accretion onto a black hole begins . with both black holes accreting",
    "there are two sources illuminating and heating the gas . as a result a portion of the gas is blown out of the plane of the disk and forms a hot `` corona '' .",
    "the temperature of the gas is highest in the vicinity of the black holes , where it is in the range of @xmath156 k. after the first passage of the secondary the disk has formed a single trailing spiral which cools radiatively and adiabatically to t@xmath157k ( fig  [ fig_xy_bb ] ) .",
    "the secondary black hole acquires a small , gravitationally bound corona of gas from the disk . after the second passage the secondary further heats and perturbs the disk gas which now reaches the scale of a parsec in the plane of the disk ( recall the disk initial size 0.01  pc ) .",
    "the secondary black hole intersects the spiral arm of the disk and gravitationally captures a portion of it . for a while , the secondary moves on its orbit followed by the remainder of the spiral arm , which resembles a cometary tail .",
    "since a large portion of the spiral arm , which retains a significant amount of colder gas in the disk , is disrupted after the second orbital passage , the effective temperature of the gas becomes more dominated by the inner hot portion of the disk .",
    "the morphology of the system at the completion of the second binary orbit consists of a discernible denser disk component immersed into a spherical halo of tenuous gas .",
    "the gas density now spans the range from @xmath158 in the disk component and it extends down to @xmath159 in the low density regions on the scale of @xmath160 pc .",
    "the speed of sound is @xmath161 and @xmath162 for the cold and hot gas phases , respectively ( table  [ t_results ] ) .    during the two orbits the accretion rate onto the two black holes is highly variable .",
    "the secondary black hole starts accreting soon after the plunge and is followed by the primary which starts accreting a year later at a much higher , super - eddington rate @xmath163 ( fig  [ fig_acc_bb ] ) .",
    "the jump in accretion rate is caused by a sudden increase in outward angular momentum transport in the disk triggered by a gravitational perturbation of the disk by the secondary .",
    "we observe such a high accretion rate in this simulation only .",
    "this happens because the high density gas in the central portion of the disk in the bb cooling model initially equilibrates at lower temperatures than in the photoionization models . the cold gas with a very low velocity dispersion is more easily driven towards the primary black hole when the secondary reaches the pericenter , at the end of year 7 of the simulation .",
    "the second pericentric passage of the secondary occurs 23 years after the beginning of the simulation . during the second passage",
    "there is no large increase in the accretion rate because the gas has acquired a significant amount of internal energy and additional kinetic energy and it is not easily swept up by the secondary .",
    "the accretion rates onto the primary and secondary black holes become comparable later in the simulation . unlike the secondary , the primary black hole exhibits large variations in the accretion rate ( @xmath42 orders of magnitude ) .",
    "this occurs because the primary black hole accretes colder gas , confined to the plane of the disk , while the secondary black hole accretes from the hotter , more uniform halo as it sweeps through it , in a process resembling bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "if the accretion continues at the mean rate derived from the first two orbits the disk mass would be exhausted in only @xmath4300 years . in order for accretion to persist the accretion disk needs to be continually replenished by an external supply of gas .",
    "the cooling rate of the gas closely follows the heating rate ( fig  [ fig_cool_bb ] ) , corresponding to a bolometric luminosity of the gas of @xmath164 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity as a function of time does not exhibit large fluctuations and remains at a nearly constant value after the first 10 years of binary evolution . in the bb - model",
    "the luminosity of the accretion powered sources dominates over the bolometric luminosity of the gas disk ( i.e. , the power locally generated in the disk ) by at least one order of magnitude during the period of `` uniform '' accretion and by several orders of magnitude during the first pericentric passage .",
    "this is a consequence of inefficient radiative cooling ( compared to photoionization calculations ) . in the bb model ,",
    "the inefficient radiative cooling is compensated by adiabatic expansion of the gas , resulting in a more pronounced spatial dispersion of the gas .",
    "figure  [ fig_xy_sr ] shows the evolution of the morphology and temperature of gas at the same times as figure  [ fig_xy_bb ] .",
    "the initial steady state disk in the solar metallicity model ( hereafter , the s - model ) has a temperature of @xmath157k and does not exhibit the `` two phase '' temperature distribution , seen in the bb - model .",
    "the speed of sound in the unperturbed disk is about @xmath165 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the gas disk during this period is powered by collisional excitation only and it is of order @xmath166 ( figure  [ fig_cool_sr ] ) .",
    "the gas in the s - model shows the same main morphological features as in the bb - model .",
    "the differences between the two are that after the interaction with the secondary the gas in the s - model remains cooler and shows less dispersion with the result that the spiral arm and filaments are more pronounced .",
    "because of the way we plot particles in figure  [ fig_xy_sr ] ( higher temperature particles are plotted over the lower temperature ones ) , part of the information remains hidden . for a better illustration , in figure  [ fig_temp_solar ]",
    "we plot the temperature distribution in the disk as a function of radius which shows that multiple temperature components can be present at a single radius .",
    "the disk density at the end of the simulation is in the range @xmath167 , and the median density is about one order of magnitude higher than in the bb - model ( see table  [ t_results ] ) .",
    "the disk gas in this model also remains well above the toomre threshold for gravitational instability .",
    "the speed of sound is about @xmath168 in the cold disk and @xmath169 in the hotter gas component .",
    "the temperature of the gas reaches the highest value ( t@xmath170 k ) after the shock is formed by the secondary . on a time scale of months",
    ", the temperature of the gas falls below @xmath171 k due to the combined effects of radiative cooling and adiabatic expansion .",
    "the dominant radiative cooling mechanisms of the shocked gas are inverse compton and free - free emission . the hot component of the gas spends a significant amount of time in the temperature range @xmath172 k. in this regime the radiative cooling is dominated by free - free emission and recombination radiation , while inverse compton emission becomes inefficient in comparison . on the other hand , the cold component of the gas , confined to the spiral arm , has the same physical properties as that in the bb - model and it retains a temperature of @xmath173 k.    in the period before the impact of the secondary , the radiative cooling rate of the solar metallicity gas matches that of the bb - model ( figs  [ fig_cool_bb ] and [ fig_cool_sr ] ) .",
    "this is an important test of the s - model , because steady , geometrically thin disks are indeed expected to be optically thick and behave as a black - body .",
    "the differences in the cooling processes between the s - model and the bb - model appear after the ( accretion - powered ) sources of ionizing radiation turn on .",
    "the gas in the s - model exhibits less efficient heating and more efficient cooling relative to the bb - model .",
    "this happens because the ionized gas remains optically thin to ionizing radiation and absorbs it less efficiently , while at the same time free - free and recombination cooling processes are boosted .",
    "once the gas has been ionized its physical properties depart from these in the black - body model .",
    "after the first pericentric passage of the secondary the accretion rate reaches @xmath174 ( figure  [ fig_acc_sr ] ) , comparable to the eddington rate for this system , @xmath175 . during the remainder of the simulation",
    "the accretion rate remains at a nearly constant level of about @xmath176 .",
    "this implies that the accretion luminosity is just below the eddington luminosity ( @xmath177 ) for a few years after the first pericentric passage of the binary and later settles at luminosity @xmath178 . during this period the bolometric luminosity of the disk , powered by shocks and illumination ,",
    "is found to be @xmath179 on average , with fluctuations of up to 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the gas disk is comparable to that of the photoionization sources .",
    "additionally , the pericentric passages , in the 7th and 23rd years of the simulation , can be easily discerned in the cooling curve ( figure  [ fig_cool_sr ] ) .",
    "these are not noticeable in the cooling curve of the bb - model ( figure  [ fig_cool_bb ] ) because its bolometric luminosity is dominated by emission from the diffuse gas component .",
    "a common property of the bb and s - models is large fluctuations in the accretion rate of the primary , a consequence of the accretion of cold gas . moreover ,",
    "the largest dips in the accretion rate of the primary coincide with the apocentric passage , when the gas is tidally pulled away from the primary and the primary exhibits the slowest orbital motion .      in this scenario",
    "the binary and gas disk rotate in opposite directions with respect to each other . in figure  [ fig_xy_sr2 ]",
    "we show the morphology and the temperature distribution , while in figure  [ fig_temp_retro ] we plot the temperature stratification in the disk for this model at a single time . during the pre - plunge phase",
    "the physical properties of the disk are comparable with those in the co - rotating s - model .",
    "the plunge of the secondary into the disk in the counter - rotating solar metallicity model ( hereafter , the sr - model ) is more energetic than in the co - rotating models , because the relative velocity of the encounter is higher .",
    "however , we observe a lower median gas temperature in the sr - model relative to the s - model .",
    "this apparent discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the counter - rotating gas disk efficiently shears the shock formed by the impact of the secondary black hole . the hot gas from the shock front is quickly transported away from the secondary and its thermal energy is radiated . when compared to each other",
    ", the three models exhibit an interesting property : while the _ median _ gas temperature is @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182k , the _",
    "mean _ temperature is @xmath183 , @xmath171 , and @xmath79k , in the sr , s , and bb - models respectively .",
    "another property of the sr - model is that its cooling curve does not exhibit peaks at the times of the pericentric passages of the binary ( figure  [ fig_cool_sr2 ] ) .",
    "the peaks noticeable in the cooling curve occur , respectively , one and two years after the pericentric passages and are not associated with the peaks in the accretion rate ( figure  [ fig_acc_sr2 ] ) .",
    "this implies that along with accretion there must be an additional mechanism that powers the bolometric emission .",
    "this second heating mechanism , which competes with photoionization , arises from shocks in the gas .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the gas disk settles at @xmath184 and the luminosity of the photoionization sources is @xmath185 .    in the counter - rotating model ,",
    "the gas is driven away from the center of the disk , as it acquires more orbital angular momentum from the binary , and the hollow region around the primary widens with time .",
    "this is why during a pericentric passage there is no characteristic jump in the accretion rate of the primary , and accretion occurs by smooth diffusion of particles from the disk .",
    "however , the accretion rate onto the secondary shows peaks corresponding to pericentric passages , and smooth undulation in between .",
    "although over the course of the two orbits we do not notice a decrease in the accretion rate , if the outbound migration of gas continues and the low density gap is formed at the center , the accretion on the primary is likely to dwindle .",
    "observationally , this implies that in these systems , only one of the sources ( the secondary ) may remain active , until its orbit gradually becomes smaller than the hollow region in the disk , at which point both black holes may stop accreting .",
    "whether both , one , or neither of the two sources are seen in emission depends on the evolutionary stage of the binary and the thermodynamic properties and supply of the low angular momentum gas in the host galaxy .",
    "a noticeable feature in the accretion curve of the primary is a dip between the 8th and 12th years .",
    "this corresponds to the time when a large portion of the gas is unbound from the disk , as shown in the second panel of figure  [ fig_xy_sr2 ] .",
    "the detached part of the disk continues to revolve around the primary until it is re - captured and wound around . after it has completed several orbits , this gas creates a complex set of rings and filaments .",
    "a fraction of this gas will fall into the primary black hole and boost its accretion rate back to @xmath186 .",
    "we calculate the x - ray luminosity powered by the two different mechanisms : accretion and bremsstrahlung emission from the hot gas .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emitting gas is heated by both , shocks and photoionization .",
    "the accretion rates onto the primary and secondary black holes estimated from the s and sr - models result in a uv / x - ray luminosity of about @xmath187 and up to @xmath188 during times of high accretion rate ( the details of the accretion curves in each model are discussed in   [ s_s - model ] and   [ s_sr - model ] and shown figures  [ fig_acc_sr ] and [ fig_acc_sr2 ] ) .    in this section",
    "we describe how the estimate of the concurrent bremsstrahlung x - ray luminosity was obtained .",
    "we calculate the thermal bremsstrahlung power per unit volume from the population of relativistic electrons hotter than @xmath115 k as @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the atomic number , @xmath89 and @xmath191 are the number densities of electrons and ions , respectively , @xmath192 is a frequency average of the velocity averaged gaunt factor and is of order 1 .",
    "the electrons are heated in the process of photoionization of the gas by the accretion powered sources and in shocks taking place in the gas perturbed by the secondary black hole . in order to calculate the resulting bremsstrahlung x - ray luminosity",
    ", we also need to know the volume occupied by the gas giving rise to this emission .",
    "the calculation of the size of the emitting volume from a sph simulation is complicated by the finite spatial resolution , as set by the characteristic size assigned to each gas particle ( i.e. , the smoothing length , @xmath68 ) . in our calculations @xmath193 . as a result of `` smoothing '' , the bremsstrahlung x - ray emission from shocks , which typically occur on scales smaller than @xmath68 in our simulations , is not resolved .",
    "consequently , the size of the emission region in this case is overestimated , while the density and the temperature in the shock are underestimated . in order to bypass this uncertainty",
    "we calculate the values of some physical properties of the x - ray emitting gas following the analytical treatment of shock structure in @xcite .",
    "first , we attempt to discriminate between the gas particles in the photoionized and shocked regions .",
    "we assume that gas particles that have a mach number @xmath194 can participate in shocks and thus contribute to the _ shock - powered _ bremsstrahlung x - ray emission . from the jump conditions we calculate the compression and temperature ratios in the shocked gas cell and from these we estimate the post - shock density and temperature of the gas . using the post - shock values of the physical parameters we calculate the cooling rate ( equation  [ [ eq_bremss ] ] ) and cooling time for the shocked gas cell under the assumption that its dominant cooling mechanism is bremsstrahlung .",
    "the corresponding cooling column of gas is then @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the pre - shock density of the gas , @xmath197 is the velocity of the shock , and @xmath198 is the cooling time .",
    "the values of the cooling column and the post - shock density of the hot gas allow us to estimate the characteristic length scale of the cooling column , @xmath199 . for typical values of the parameters in the shocked gas cells in our simulations , where @xmath200 and @xmath201 , we obtain @xmath202 .",
    "we use this information to constrain the x - ray emitting volume within a shocked gas cell . given that @xmath203 of gas particles fulfill the condition @xmath204 and post - shock @xmath205 , we find that the resulting bremsstrahlung x - ray luminosity from the shocked gas is in the range @xmath206 , with peaks reaching @xmath207 .    in the second step we estimate the bremsstrahlung x - ray luminosity emitted from the photoionized portion of the gas .",
    "we identify the gas cells responsible for most of the x - ray emission _ powered by photoionization _ as low density cells with temperatures higher than @xmath208 .",
    "the hot , optically thin , photoionized component of the gas forms a halo with a median density of @xmath209 .",
    "the photoionized regions are more spatially extended than the shocked regions and their characteristic scale is @xmath210 .",
    "the number of photoionized gas particles that contribute to the x - ray bremsstrahlung emission at any given time is about a few percent of all gas particles .",
    "however , the large volume of this halo makes up for its small mass and low number density .",
    "thus , the resulting bremsstrahlung luminosity from the halo is @xmath211 , comparable to the estimated contribution of the shocked regions .",
    "we emphasize that the estimates of the bremsstrahlung x - ray luminosity presented here are based on astrophysically motivated but simplified assumptions .",
    "for example , while @xmath204 may be a necessary condition for a gas particle to participate in shocks , not every such particle will do so .",
    "the shocks may be avoided in ordered , laminar flows where the trajectories of particles do not intersect .",
    "however , we expect that the gravitational perturbation from the secondary black hole will cause shocks , especially in the inner portion of the disk where the dynamical time scale of particles is much shorter than the period of the binary and the density of the gas is higher . in the case of photoionization ,",
    "not all hot , low density gas particles will be entirely photoionized , making the effective emitting volume ( or equivalently the emitting mass ) only a fraction of the total in a gas cell .",
    "there may also be particles which participate in shocks and are at the same time photoionized by the accretion powered sources .",
    "for all these reasons and because the structure of the nuclear region is very complex , we note that the above estimates should be regarded as constraints rather than exact values .",
    "the total bremsstrahlung x - ray luminosity ( shock plus photoionization powered ) of the gas in our simulations is lower than the accretion - powered uv / x - ray luminosity , although during the times of pericentric passage the peak bremsstrahlung x - ray luminosity is comparable to the accretion - powered x - ray luminosity .",
    "the latter x - ray light curve exhibits peaks during pericentric passages of the binary , thus the peaks are good markers of such events .",
    "the estimated level of the total x - ray emission ( accretion powered plus bremsstrahlung ) should be observable to a redshift of @xmath212 during the outburst phases .",
    "although our calculations follow the evolution of the binary over only two orbital passages we suggest that in binary systems of this type , x - ray outbursts should be expected to continue as long as there is gas in the nuclear region for the binary to interact with .",
    "our models imply that at the mean level of accretion , the gaseous disks should be depleted after @xmath173 yr . in order for the outburst activity to last for longer time scales ,",
    "the reservoir of gas in the nuclear region needs to be continually replenished .",
    "it is also plausible , however , that repeated collisions of the secondary black hole with the disk will completely disrupt it and turn it into a spherical halo of hot gas .",
    "in such a case , the accretion rate would be relatively smooth and uniform , and no outburst would be evident .",
    "a calculation following the x - ray light curve variability over a large number of orbits is necessary in order to confirm that the periodicity is a long lived signature of the binary .",
    "although currently not possible with the sph method used here , simulations of the long term evolution of the binary together with hydrodynamics and radiative transfer may be achieved in the future by a hybrid approach including complementary numerical techniques . in particular , they may be realized by combining semi - analytical hydrodynamical calculations with emphasis on the long term dynamical evolution of gas with methods that focus on hydrodynamics and radiative transfer , like the one used here .      by modeling the h@xmath0 light curves for the s and sr - models",
    "we find that after the beginning of accretion the h@xmath0 luminosity gradually reaches @xmath213 in both models ( figures  [ fig_ha_solar ] and [ fig_ha_retro ] ) .",
    "sources with such h@xmath0 luminosities are observable out to the distance of the virgo cluster and possibly up to a distance of 100 mpc . during the steady - state phase , before the plunge of the secondary into the disk , both models are characterized by a low h@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath214 .",
    "this is an artifact of the calculation , a consequence of the choice of initial conditions , because in the pre - plunge phase the emission from the gas is entirely thermal emission from the disk and the effects of photoionization are not taken into account .",
    "such neutral and non - illuminated accretion disks are unlikely to be encountered in nuclear regions of agns , even if these are characterized with very low accretion rates .",
    "although in our model the h@xmath0 light is closely linked with accretion , it does not closely follow the variations in the accretion rate .",
    "neither the h@xmath0 light curve exhibits easily recognizable periodic features during the first two orbits of the binary .",
    "the only occasion when a noticeable jump in the h@xmath0 luminosity occurs is in the sr - model , after the first pericentric passage ( figure  [ fig_ha_retro ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 light is predominantly contributed by a spatially extended component of the gas and is less susceptible to shocks by the secondary .",
    "the gradual increase in the h@xmath0 luminosity noticeable in both light curves is caused by the redistribution of the photoionized gas in space . as gas expands to a scale of a parsec , its density and optical depth decrease , and the solid angle subtended to the photoionizing source increases . as a result",
    ", a larger fraction of ionizing photons is reprocessed to h@xmath0 photons and the physical properties of the gas evolve towards those found in photoionized nebulae .",
    "it appears difficult to infer the existence of a binary in the nuclear region of a galaxy based on the h@xmath0 light curve alone .",
    "serendipitous flares in the h@xmath0 light curve may occur close to pericentric passages but their duration may be fairly short ( here , @xmath215month , the upper limit set by the time resolution in the light curve ) and consequently hard to observe .",
    "the periodic outbursts may be more pronounced in cases when the binary orbit is inclined with respect to the disk , but such models remain to be explored .",
    "we also calculate the broad h@xmath0 emission - line profiles for both the s and sr - models in order to better illustrate the kinematics of the gas ( see figures  [ fig_prof_solar ] and [ fig_prof_retro ] ) .",
    "all profiles have been calculated under the assumption that the observer is located at a distance @xmath216 in the positive @xmath137-plane , at @xmath138 to the @xmath139-axis .",
    "initially , from the unperturbed disk we observe double - peaked emission line profiles but they gradually depart from this shape as the perturbation propagates through the gas . for reasons discussed above",
    ", the regular h@xmath0 profiles from a quiescent , cold disk , have a low intensity .",
    "the profiles appear variable on a time scale of months to years , both in shape and width .",
    "the profiles in both sets show an extended , low intensity red wing , most pronounced during the periods of increased accretion and after the times of pericentric passages . during such events",
    "a number of emitting gas particles find themselves deeper in the potential well of the binary .",
    "the emitted photons that leave the potential well are gravitationally redshifted and doppler boosted , thus contributing to the extended red wing and the blue shoulder of the relativistic h@xmath0 profiles .",
    "the changes in the profile sequence can be better seen in the trailed spectrograms , shown in figures  [ fig_trail_solar ] and [ fig_trail_retro ] , which are the 2d maps of the h@xmath0 intensity against observed velocity ( or wavelength ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission in the trailed spectrograms from both s and sr - models appears redshifted relative to the rest wavelength .",
    "in addition , the emission in the extended red wing of the profile is easily noticeable , especially in the sr - model ( figure  [ fig_trail_retro ] ) , where this effect is most dramatic after the pericentric passages of the binary .",
    "since doppler boosting of the blue side of the line and gravitational redshift of the red wing are pronounced during and after the pericentric passages of the binary , they can serve as indicators of the orbital period . in the trailed spectrogram of the s - model it is possible to discern the repeating behavior in the windows between 7 to 22 years and 22 to 36 years . the width of the h@xmath0 profile increases after the pericentric passages of the system , reflecting the inflow of gas towards the primary .",
    "additionally the widening of the profile appears asymmetric and shifted towards the red with respect to the pre - pericentric sequence of profiles .",
    "this shift is a signature of the motion of the accretion disk which follows the primary on its orbit .",
    "the shift is even more pronounced in the trailed spectrogram of the sr - model which also exhibits narrower emission line profiles than the s - model .",
    "this difference arises from the difference in kinematics of the innermost portion of the accretion disk surrounding the primary . in the sr - model",
    "the gas at the inner edge of the disk becomes gradually less bound to the primary black hole over time due to the interactions with the binary .",
    "we compare the trailed spectrograms with the velocity curves of the two binary components projected onto the line of sight ( right panels in figures  [ fig_trail_solar ] and [ fig_trail_retro ] ) . because of the nonzero eccentricity of the orbit the velocity curves appear skewed . the variations in the profile intensities in the s - model correspond to the features in the velocity curve of the secondary in year 7 and 23 , when it moves away from the observer with the highest projected velocity .",
    "in the sr - model the velocity curve of the secondary appears as a mirror image of certain features in the trailed spectrogram because in this model the gas rotates in the opposite direction with respect to the binary . in general",
    ", we expect the signature of the velocity curves of the two black holes to appear in the emission line profiles at pericentric passages , because that is when the binary interaction with the gas is strongest .",
    "if such features could be discerned in the observed h@xmath0 emission - line profiles , they would signal the presence of a binary .    in practice",
    ", one may constrain the period and the mass ratio of the binary from the periodicity and projected velocity components of the two black holes , all measured from the h@xmath0 profile sequence .",
    "the determination of the individual black hole masses is more challenging , because it requires knowledge of the inclination of the binary orbit with respect to the observer .",
    "in general , the inclination of the binary orbit may not be the same as that of the accretion disk but in some cases it may be possible to determine it relative to the accretion disk .",
    "if the binary orbit is _ circular _ , fewer parameters are needed to constrain the properties of the system , and it should be possible to determine the individual masses of black holes , given a knowledge of the observed velocity components of the two black holes at a single point of time , orbital period , and the inclination of the system . to constrain the shape and the orientation of an _ elliptical _ binary orbit one would in addition need information about the velocity components at pericenter and apocenter , as well as the orbital separation of the binary .",
    "before any of these parameters can be measured from observations of light curves and the h@xmath0 line sequence , it is necessary to follow at least a few revolutions of the binary .",
    "we note several other qualitative features of the h@xmath0 profiles , which can shed light on the motion of gas in the nuclear region . in both models ,",
    "the central part of the profile , contributed by emission from the low velocity gas , becomes more pronounced with time .",
    "this low velocity core of the profile is contributed by filaments of gas which have been expelled from the center at the expense of the angular momentum of the binary .",
    "the same effect re - appears during the second orbital passage when a new low velocity component is added to the system . in this",
    "process filaments with a similar morphology are formed during each passage , on a slightly different length scale , because the older filaments have had time to expand , and with a slightly different phase , due to the effect of rotation .",
    "although it is expected that all agns host black holes fed by an accretion disk , broad , double or multi - peaked emission - line profiles are observed only in a small fraction of objects @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the h@xmath0 line profiles can be affected by physical conditions in the nuclear region , other than the phase - space distribution of the emitting gas , such as optical depth to h@xmath0 photons and electron scattering .",
    "figure  [ fig_haemiss ] illustrates that a significant fraction of the h@xmath0 light is contributed by the hot ionized gas located in the inner disk , via recombination .",
    "this component of the gas is transparent to h@xmath0 photons ( figure  [ fig_tauha ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the profiles will likely be affected by the high h@xmath0 opacity in regions of the disk where the gas temperatures are just below @xmath217 k and the neutral hydrogen column density is high ( figure  [ fig_colden ] ) .    the second factor , which impacts the shape of the h@xmath0 emission - line profile , but to a lesser extent the h@xmath0 luminosity , is electron scattering .",
    "as expected , the ionized gas will have the highest optical depth to thomson scattering ( figure  [ fig_taut ] ) .",
    "we find that the maximum value of @xmath218 in our calculation is about 10 , observed for the hottest gas cells .",
    "about 60@xmath142 of the mass of the gas has optical depth to thomson scattering larger than 1 , in our simulations .",
    "when thomson scattering is significant , the hot corona with a high thermal velocity dispersion ( @xmath219 ) could smooth out some emission features in the h@xmath0 profiles , although the emission profiles should still show up clearly .",
    "such conditions can be met in nuclear regions hosting a strong photoionization source .",
    "although the effects of optical depth in the gas can play an important role in estimates of h@xmath0 luminosity and appearance of the h@xmath0 emission line profiles , we are not able to account for these effects in our calculations .",
    "we used conservative values for the model parameters , such as the radiative efficiency and covering factor , throughout the paper so that the h@xmath0 luminosity is not significantly over - estimated .",
    "the problem of the propagation of photons along the line of sight is numerically complex and is likely to be accurately treated with the new generation of codes which incorporate ray - tracing techniques in the radiative transfer calculations .      in this section",
    "we describe the changes in the binary orbit due to interactions with the gas and compare them with analytical estimates .",
    "the evolution of the binding energy and orbital angular momentum of the binary in the bb , s , and sr - model is shown in figures  [ fig_el_bb ] , [ fig_el_cs ] , and [ fig_el_csr ] , respectively . in all three models",
    "the binary system shows a net loss of both energy and orbital angular momentum .",
    "the mean dissipation rate of the binding energy , calculated from the simulations is @xmath220 for the bb - model and @xmath221 in the s , and sr - model . as a result",
    "the second pericentric passage in the s - model occurs about 100 days later than in the bb - model ( see figures  [ fig_xy_bb ] and [ fig_xy_sr ] at a time of 23.2 years ) .",
    "the mean rate of energy dissipation due to emission of gravitational radiation is @xmath222 and thus the evolution of the binary orbit is dominated by interactions with the gas . because the rate of gravitational wave emission is very similar for all three models we show it only once , in the inset of figure  [ fig_el_cs ] .    in all three models the binary",
    "is initially placed on the same orbit , hence the differences in evolution of the orbital parameters among the models are entirely due to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the gas . recall that in the bb - model the gas initially redistributes into two phases with a temperature contrast of about an order of magnitude (   [ s_bb - model ] ) . the cold phase present in the bb - model is missing in the s - model , where the secondary black hole interacts with the warmer and more tenuous gas and consequently dissipates its energy more gradually .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite that the binary evolution depends strongly on the `` clumpiness '' of the gas , and that the binary suffers a stronger deceleration in gaseous media with weaker pressure support .",
    "after the first pericentric passage , the cold gas phase in the bb - model disappears , due to shock and photoionization heating , and e and l evolve in a less dramatic way .",
    "the rates of dissipation of energy and orbital angular momentum in figures  [ fig_el_bb ] , [ fig_el_cs ] , and [ fig_el_csr ] are functions of the orbital phase of the binary because the binary spends a fraction of its time moving through the disk",
    ". therefore , the interaction of the binary and the accretion disk occur in two different regimes studied by @xcite . in the first regime",
    "the disk is confined to the roche lobe of the primary black hole  and the secondary is outside the disk and interacts with it tidally . for a mass ratio @xmath223 and and a reynolds number @xmath224 @xcite",
    "show that when @xmath225 , the tidal force overtakes the viscous expansion of the disk , and the secondary effectively removes the angular momentum at the outer edge of the disk by truncating the disk ( in our simulations @xmath226 and @xmath227 ) .",
    "the excess angular momentum is transported to the binary via tidal torques . in the second regime ,",
    "the secondary is orbiting within the circumbinary disk and truncate the inner edge of the disk @xcite through its tidal forces . in this regime",
    "the disk acts as an effective energy and angular momentum sink and the binary should evolve towards a more bound state via resonant interactions with the disk .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with our findings from the bb and s - models , where the binary is co - rotating with the disk and is found to reach the minimum binding energy when both black holes are close to the pericenter and within the disk .",
    "an additional torque arises from the fact that the velocity vectors of the binary on the elliptical orbit and the gas around the primary on circular orbits continuously change their respective orientation ; thus the torque acting on the binary changes accordingly . in the co - rotating case ,",
    "the secondary experiences a torque that pushes it away from the primary as it approaches pericenter and a torque that pushes it inwards as after it passes pericenter .",
    "this effect can be seen in figure  [ fig_el_cs ] : the binary evolves from a more bound to a less bound energy state as it passes pericenter and the slope of the energy curve is negative . in the counter - rotating case ,",
    "the secondary and the disk orbit in the opposite sense and the effect of torques is reversed .",
    "figure  [ fig_el_csr ] shows this reversal : the slope of the energy curve is positive during the pericentric passage .",
    "we first compare the rate of dissipation of orbital energy of the binary with that predicted by @xcite for the case where a massive perturber moving supersonically experiences the dynamical friction force arising from the wake that formed in the ambient medium .",
    "this rate can be expressed as @xmath228 where @xmath229 and @xmath230 are the mass and velocity of the perturber , @xmath231 is the density of the gaseous medium , and @xmath232 and @xmath233 are related to the linear size of the medium and the perturber .",
    "if we assume that @xmath232 is comparable to the radius of the disk and @xmath233 to the accretion radius of the black hole , then @xmath234 . in our simulations the wake of the hot gas trailing the secondary black hole can be seen in panel 1 of figures  [ fig_xy_bb ] and [ fig_xy_sr ] .    however",
    ", as discussed by @xcite , tidal torques and resonant scattering play an important role in the interaction of a binary with a shear flow .",
    "we also note that dynamical friction can not be the dominant dissipation mechanism in the sr - model . in this model ,",
    "the disk rotates in the opposite sense from the binary and the wake formed by the secondary is efficiently sheared away from the secondary .",
    "we utilize the expression from @xcite for the tidal torque exerted by the binary on the disk in the process of gap formation and obtain @xmath235 @xmath236 where @xmath150 is the angular velocity of the gas interacting with the black hole at radius @xmath18 , @xmath151 is the surface density of the gas disk , @xmath237 is the half - size of the gap , and @xmath238 is the half - thickness of the disk .",
    "the results of our simulations are consistent with both mechanisms being responsible for the dissipation of the binary orbital energy .",
    "we also note that dynamical friction can not be the dominant dissipation mechanism in the case of the binary and gas disk rotating in the opposite sense from each other . assuming that the binary maintains a rate of energy dissipation of @xmath239",
    ", it would proceed to coalescence in only @xmath240yr .",
    "most likely , the rate of inspiral due to interactions with the gaseous background will not persist at this high rate over long periods of time .",
    "@xcite for example discussed the evolution of a binary on a circular orbit , in the gas disk , from separations of 0.1 to @xmath241  pc . extrapolating from their results",
    "one obtains that from the separation of 0.01  pc , a combination of disk - driven migration and inspiral due to gravitational radiation leads to coalescence within few@xmath242 years . in order to obtain a robust estimate of the orbital decay rate",
    "one should follow the evolution of the binary and gas starting from much larger separations . while this task was undertaken by a number of authors @xcite it is still a computational challenge to extend the wide dynamic range of the simulations to the lowest binary separations , where gravitational radiation overtakes the dissipation caused by the gaseous background .",
    "here we discuss the impact of underlying assumptions in our models on the observable electromagnetic signatures and the relevance of our results in the context of the larger scale simulations .",
    "a more massive disk would change the gas drag , hence make the binary evolve faster and vice versa .",
    "this would affect the number of pericentric passages of the binary and in turn the number of peaks in the cooling rate and x - ray light curves occurring over a given period of time .",
    "the number of shifts in wavelength space noticeable in the h@xmath0 trailed spectrogram would also change , reflecting the change in the orbital period of the binary .",
    "this may complicate the prediction and observational followup of the outbursts , since after the first few orbital cycles the uncertainty in the orbital period of the binary will be rather large ( weeks to months ; see the example of oj  287 ) .",
    "if a decrease in the orbital period of a mbhb candidate can be determined from the observed light curves , it would imply that the binary is dissipating orbital angular momentum via interactions with the gas disk or emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the mbhbs likely to be discovered by monitoring of light curves and h@xmath0 emission line profiles of candidate galaxies would likely have orbital periods of order of 10  yr or less , implying binaries with subparsec orbital separations .",
    "the dominant dissipation mechanism could be determined if a constraint on the masses of black holes can be put in addition to the rate of change of the orbital period .",
    "one could then compare the observed rate of inspiral to that predicted by the theory of general relativity for some assumed eccentricity ; if the two are discrepant this could be explained by presence of the gaseous dynamical friction .",
    "besides the total mass , the efficiency of dynamical friction depends on the structure of the accretion disk .",
    "the intensity of the gas drag is stronger in systems where the density of the gas is higher and where a massive body moves supersonically with respect to the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the structure of nuclear accretion disks on a subparsec scale is rather uncertain and in our calculations we assumed that the disk is geometrically thin .",
    "the results from the larger scale simulations by @xcite and @xcite provide useful insights into the effect that a different equation of state of the gas disk can have on the orbital decay of the binary at separations of 10@xmath6100  pc .",
    "both groups find that the binary inspiral is more efficient in galactic disks with less pressure support and smaller scale heights .",
    "such disks resemble clumpy and dense disks in starforming galaxies .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that for a galactic merger to result in a bound pair of massive black holes and eventually a coalescence within the hubble time , the agn should not play an important role as an source of heat in the disk during the merger phase .",
    "a number of authors found that when a large fraction of the disk gas is funneled to the central 1  kpc , following a galactic merger , it can lead to nuclear starburst on timescale less than @xmath120  yr @xcite . because it may take @xmath115  yr or longer for a binary to sink from kiloparsec to subparsec scales , the mbhb inspiral and coalescence in such galaxies may coincide with an active starburst @xcite .",
    "it appears that if a starburst reaches its peak before the mbhb merges , a large fraction of the gas may be already turned into stars while the remaining gas will be exposed to the starburst feedback , thus diminishing the role of gas as a dissipation agent in the mbhb inspiral",
    ". the resulting accretion rate onto the black holes may be too low to give rise to observable signatures in the form of periodic outbursts and variable h@xmath0 emission line profiles ; these galaxies would appear as ultraluminous or luminous starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , if the onset of a strong agn activity in either of the parent nuclei precedes the starburst , the mechanical and radiative feedback could inhibit both the starburst and further accretion onto the black holes and thus suppress the electromagnetic signatures of the binary .",
    "since a fully 3d radiative transfer calculation has not been developed yet the model of radiation physics that is employed here relies on several assumptions .",
    "here we address the key assumptions that can directly affect the balance between heating and cooling in the simulation , and consequently the electromagnetic signatures of the binary system .",
    "the first assumption is related to the covering factor , @xmath69 , used to parametrize the effects of self - shielding and geometry when gas is illuminated by the incident radiation ( equation  [ eq_bb_heating ] ) . in our calculation",
    "this coefficient has a fixed value while realistically it is a function of time and the position of a particle with respect to the source of illumination .",
    "varying @xmath69 would result in a different temperature in the gas hence , different amounts of hot and cold components of gas .",
    "for example , a larger value of @xmath69 would amount in an increase of the diffuse , hot component of gas .",
    "this would boost the h@xmath0 and x - ray luminosities but may not affect significantly the conclusions about the variability of these components .",
    "alternatively , a smaller value of @xmath69 would result in more gas being in the cold phase and confined to the plane of the disk . in this scenario both the h@xmath0 and x - ray luminosities would be lower , and the h@xmath0 light could also exhibit a periodicity .",
    "this is because the colder and denser gas is more susceptible to shocks induced by the secondary black hole .",
    "another important assumption in our calculation is that radiative cooling of the gaseous accretion disk can be approximated by a sum over the discrete gas particles .",
    "each particle represents a gas cell of mass 0.1@xmath243 .",
    "the approximation should converge to an exact solution when @xmath244 in case when the gas is optically thin to radiation .",
    "we thus conclude that for the diffuse gas component in our simulations this approximation should be a satisfactory description and we turn attention to the optically thick component .",
    "this component has a higher neutral hydrogen column density ( figure  [ fig_colden ] ) and is confined to a disk with the thickness corresponding to one smoothing length , @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the vertical structure of the disk is not resolved and every gas cell within the disk should cool by emission from the top and bottom of its surface .",
    "this is equivalent to a geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk model where gas cools by emission from the two faces of the disk . in our model",
    "the gas cells radiate isotropically , over their entire surface area and according to the cooling rate per unit area determined by _",
    "cloudy_. thus we overestimate the total cooling from the optically thick component of gas by a factor of approximately 2 .",
    "the largest error is expected for the bb - model , where all gas particles are assumed to be optically thick , while the s and sr models should provide a more accurate description .",
    "increasing the resolution yields a better accuracy in the calculation of angular momentum transport and at the same time it may cause larger errors in the treatment of cooling in our models .",
    "we chose 100k particles for the bb , s , and sr models and carried out several tests in order to assess the role of resolution in the heating , cooling , and evolution of angular momentum in our simulations .",
    "the first set of tests is carried out by evolving the initial conditions ( the ic - runs , see table  [ t_results ] ) , with the primary black hole and the solar metallicity gas disk , before the secondary black hole is introduced .",
    "thus we can isolate the dependence of angular momentum transport and cooling on resolution , in absence of shocks .",
    "the results of the three runs , ic1 , ic2 , and ic3 with 20k , 100k , and 500k particles , respectively , are shown in figures  [ fig_res_sden_temp ] and [ fig_res_cool ] , after the initial conditions were evolved for 8 years .",
    "the evolution of angular momentum appears strongest in the 20k run where the pressure gradient drives the evolution of the surface density at the inner disk radius ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig_res_sden_temp ] ) while at larger radii the distributions appear consistent .",
    "the dominant component of pressure is thermal gas pressure ; the viscous pressure is of lesser importance and it operates on much longer time scales .",
    "the accretion disks at lower resolution thus appear to have more gas pressure support than at higher resolution .",
    "lower resolution also results in more viscous disks and shorter viscous time scales , as shown in middle panel of figure  [ fig_res_sden_temp ] where we plot the viscous time scale , @xmath245 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_res_sden_temp ] shows the temperature profile of the disk calculated at three different resolutions , from the same snapshot in time .",
    "the disk in the 500k ic3 is the coldest compared to the 100k ic2 and 20k ic1 runs .",
    "this is a consequence of the dependence of the cooling model on the resolution . in the solar metallicity models ,",
    "the disk cooling rate is expected to scale with the total number of gas particles and their emitting volume as @xmath246 .",
    "figure  [ fig_res_cool ] shows the cooling curves of an unperturbed , passively cooling disk for the three runs with the cooling being strongest in the 500k one .",
    "the scaling notably departs from the analytical expectation because the adaptive smoothing length , @xmath68 , does not decrease with the resolution as quickly as @xmath247 .",
    "consequently , the higher resolution runs are characterized by a larger cooling volume with respect to the lower resolution ones . because the cooling rate of a black - body emitter is characterized by its emitting surface area , rather than volume",
    ", the dependence of the cooling on resolution is different in the bb - model . in this case the cooling rate is nominally expected to increase with resolution as @xmath248 ( see s  [ s_cooling ] ) .",
    "however , the cooling rate may have stronger dependence on @xmath249 due to the behavior of @xmath68 with resolution , as described previously for the solar metallicity case .    in order to estimate how much the cooling rates measured from our simulations suffer from the systematics discussed in this section",
    ", we compare the cooling rates for the passively cooling disk from the ic runs with the analytically calculated cooling rate for a black body with @xmath250k and surface area equal to that of the disk .",
    "the comparison is meaningful because the cold , nearly isothermal , optically thick and geometrically thin disk can be described as a black body until it is perturbed or illuminated .",
    "we obtain a cooling rate of @xmath251 , which is slightly higher but within an order of magnitude of the cooling rate in the 100k ic2 run ( figure  [ fig_res_cool ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the early portions of the cooling curves in the bb , s , and sr models , before the passage of the secondary through the disk ( figures  [ fig_cool_bb ] , [ fig_cool_sr ] , and [ fig_cool_sr2 ] ) .",
    "their difference from the analytic estimate value can be explained by slight departures of the temperature of the gas particles from @xmath252k .",
    "we conclude that the cooling rates calculated in our models with 100k particles are in fair agreement with the analytic estimate in the limit of an optically thick gas disk .",
    "we also discuss a possibility for further improving the bb cooling model and suppress the dependence of cooling on resolution in ",
    "[ s_prospects ] .    in the second set of tests we examine the effect of resolution on the accretion rates and the variable h@xmath0 emission line profiles in the presence of the secondary black hole .",
    "these quantities are connected to the resolution through the graininess of the gas and through the artificial viscosity , which leads to different results for shocks . for the purpose of the test we carried out the s1 simulation of the binary with a prograde disk using 20k particles ( analogous to the 100k s model ) .",
    "the accretion rate curves ( figure  [ fig_acc_20k ] ) show the same prominent features as the ones in the 100k s - model ( figure  [ fig_acc_sr ] ) .",
    "the total accretion rate in the 20k s1 run is in the range @xmath253 and is slightly higher than in the 100k s run . in the lower resolution",
    "run the contrast between the accretion rate of the secondary black hole at pericenter and apocenter appears higher , creating pronounced periodic humps in the accretion curve .",
    "this is likely the result of the bondi - like accretion on the secondary coupled with a lower particle number density in the 20k s1 run .",
    "in addition , we calculate the h@xmath0 emission line profiles from the 20k s1 run in the same way as in the s model ; the results are shown in figure  [ fig_prof_20k ] . as a consequence of the lower cooling in the 20k",
    "run , the intrinsic intensity of the h@xmath0 lines is several times lower than in the 100k s - model run but the integrated h@xmath0 luminosity is the same , @xmath254 .",
    "this can be understood having in mind that while the intrinsic line intensity decreases at lower resolutions , the smoothing radius used to estimate the emitting surface of a gas particle , increases , and the two effects cancel out in calculation of luminosity .",
    "the shape and width of the profiles show the same dominant features as the profiles in 100k s - run and do not appear to be very sensitive to the change of resolution .",
    "while employing a higher number of particles has a clear advantage we find that a satisfactory accuracy is achieved with 100k particles given the time scales involved in our simulations .",
    "the evolution of angular momentum in the 100k runs is slow and the viscous evolution even slower and they do not result in shocks and transients in the gas .",
    "the estimated systematic error in cooling rate due to the dependence on resolution is within one order of magnitude and the shapes of the h@xmath0 emission line profiles appear robust .    in the last paragraph of   [ s_binary_simulations ]",
    "we describe the approximation we used in order to estimate the accretion rates of the two black holes given the properties of their perturbed but unresolved accretion flows .",
    "we tested whether the accretion rate onto the secondary black hole affects the results by lowering it by a factor of 100 in one of the models .",
    "we refer to this as the s2-model . from this run ,",
    "in which we employed 20k particles , we calculated the observational signatures and found that they are very similar to the 20k s1 and 100k s - models ( specifically , the cooling curve features and periodicity , h@xmath0 profiles , and h@xmath0 light curve ) .",
    "the implication is that varying the accretion rate efficiency of the secondary black hole with respect to that of the primary has a weak effect on the resulting observational signatures .",
    "as long as the primary black hole maintains equal or higher accretion rate than the secondary , the latter can be regarded as a passive perturber .",
    "we also note that the estimates of accretion rates in both accretion models are rather conservative , thus it is more likely that we underestimate rather than overestimate the accretion rate .    in our simulations we modeled the binary with the semi - major axis of 0.015 pc , in the regime",
    "when the dissipation due to the gaseous background is still dominant over the gravitational radiation .",
    "this regime corresponds to the disk - driven migration stage in the 2d grid simulations of a binary and locally isothermal disk by . because there is an overlap in the scales treated by our respective simulations we compare the results of the two works . note that in our simulations the binary orbit is assumed to be elliptical and the disk surface density initially corresponds to @xmath255 at the distance of 100@xmath256 from the primary , in comparison to the circular orbit and the surface density of @xmath257 in an .",
    "we find that the low density quasi - spherical outflow in our models reaches the scale of 1  pc in about 40 years , implying the outflow velocities of @xmath258 , in agreement with the prediction of an .",
    "unlike an , we find that in the phase of the disk - driven migration the accretion rate of the primary is higher than the rate expected in the absence of a binary .",
    "the rate expected in the latter case is @xmath259 while the rate measured from our simulations @xmath260 .",
    "we attribute this difference to a temperature distribution of the gas and the eccentric binary orbit . in our simulations , in general case , different gas phases can be found to reside at the same radii in the disk ( figures  [ fig_temp_solar ] and [ fig_temp_retro ] ) . the cold component of gas at t@xmath261  k is mostly confined to the plane of the binary orbit where it gets swept by the secondary black hole during every passage through the disk and accreted . in addition , a binary on an eccentric orbit effectively perturbs the accretion disk and drives the spatially extended high velocity outflows .",
    "the outflows carry away the excess angular momentum , allowing the gas at the innermost region of the disk to be accreted .",
    "the physical parameter space of a binary and gas disk system is very large and a thorough parameter study is beyond the scope of this paper . in the future it will be useful to investigate systems with different mass ratios in which the binary orbit and gaseous disk are not coplanar . in these systems",
    "the secondary black hole does not gradually migrate through the plane of the disk but crosses through the disk at some inclination .",
    "consequently , such encounters are expected to have unique emission signatures .",
    "the next , even more general set of systems to be studied are binaries with two gas disks at different relative inclinations .    because the model of radiation physics plays a decisive role in determining the character of the observational signatures , we outline a possible avenue for future improvement of the bb - model . introducing",
    "a flux - limited diffusion approximation @xcite can offer a more accurate treatment of the optically thick component of gas by emulating a continuous diffuse radiation field in the inter - particle space . in this approximation the sph particles which are embedded within some gas distribution diffuse heat to their neighbor particles as determined by the temperature gradient and coefficient of diffusion .",
    "the particles defining a surface boundary of an emitting region in addition to diffusion can freely radiate as a black - body or according to some other prescription .",
    "the main challenge in the implementation is determining which gas particles are constituents of the boundary layer in general case , when the normal of an emitting surface is not aligned with any preferred axis in the system and when its orientation varies in space and time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of a disk geometry ) .",
    "because our simulations are computationally expensive , we were not able to follow the longer - term evolution of the binary and the disk on time scales on which a gap is expected to form in the disk .",
    "the gap is a low density region that forms at the center of an accretion disk , on a scale comparable to that of the binary orbit , as a consequence of tidal torques that the binary exerts on the disk @xcite .",
    "while we observed a lower peak density in the innermost region of the disk at the end of simulations , whether a gap in the disk is efficiently cleared or continuously replenished by the gas will depend on the gas temperature and hence , on the treatment of heating and cooling .",
    "the simple , exploratory models described here can be of importance in cases when the gap is either replenished or its formation process is not efficient .",
    "however in the future we will explore models in which the gap has already formed in the disk and investigate its implications for the accretion rates and observational signatures .",
    "we developed a method for calculation of the observational signatures of mbhbs with an associated gas component .",
    "the method comprises sph calculations carried out with a modified version of the code _ gadget _ coupled with calculations of cooling and heating of the gas .",
    "we implemented and tested two different schemes for heating and cooling of gas in which the gas is described as a black - body emitter or a photoionized gas with solar composition . in the solar metallicity model heating and cooling of the gas",
    "are pre - calculated with the photoionization code _ cloudy _ , along with the emission efficiency of the h@xmath0 line , the optical depth to thomson scattering , and the neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "this information allows us to calculate the h@xmath0 light curves and h@xmath0 emission line profiles from this system .",
    "since mbhbs may spend the largest fraction of their lives at sub - parsec scales @xcite it is particularly interesting to study the observational signatures of such binaries . in this paper",
    "we investigated the electromagnetic signatures of binaries based on a few exploratory models ; we outline the most important findings below :    * based on the first set of models , presented here , we find that the x - ray outbursts should occur during pericentric passages of a coplanar binary .",
    "we suggest that periodical x - ray outbursts should persist as long as there is a supply of gas that the mbhb can interact with .",
    "a calculation of a much larger number of binary orbits is needed in order to confirm that the periodic outbursts are a long lived signature of the binary . at the estimated level of x - ray luminosity the binary systems interacting with",
    "the gas should be observable to a redshift of @xmath262 . * except for the recurrent outbursts in the x - ray light curve the signature of a binary is most easily discernible in the h@xmath0 emission line _",
    "profiles_. the variable shape of the broad h@xmath0 emission line profiles can be used as a first indicator when searching for mbhbs in the nearby universe , within 100  mpc . once the binary candidates are selected from a large spectroscopic survey ( e.g. , the sdss )",
    "they can be monitored over long time intervals to look for the time - dependent signature of a binary . based on our simulations ( for a mass ratio of 0.1 )",
    ", the wavelength shift in the h@xmath0 emission lines over the course of an orbital period should be measurable .",
    "if one can follow the regular variations of the line over a few cycles , one could constrain the properties of the binary , such as orbital period and the binary mass ratio . * the observed signatures predicted here arise from the gas disk and accretion onto the two nuclei , both of which may not be detectable in galaxies where the nuclear region is obscured or gas exhausted by the starburst .",
    "the resulting signatures are in addition sensitive to the adopted model of radiation physics but are not very sensitive to the number of particles employed in the sph simulations . * the evolution of the intermediate phase binaries considered here is driven by interactions of the black holes with the accretion disk gas , while the emission of gravitational waves is secondary ( 34 orders of magnitude lower ) .",
    "orbital energy is dissipated primarily via dynamical friction against the gaseous background and tidal torques in case of a binary co - rotating with the disk . in case of a counter - rotating binary ,",
    "the tidal torques play the dominant role in the dissipation since dynamical friction becomes ineffective .",
    "* the current limitation of the numerical method used in this study is that the calculation of a large number of orbits following the hydrodynamics and radiative heating and cooling becomes prohibitively expensive .",
    "therefore , we are only able to model the observational signature of the system for a brief period of its evolution , after we have assumed a specific initial configuration .    if the signatures of binaries are found in observations , they could be used to estimate the number of mbhbs in this evolutionary stage and whether mbhbs indeed evolve quickly through the last parsec .",
    "although the intermediate phase binaries themselves emit gravitational waves at frequencies too low to be detected with _",
    "lisa _ their discovery is important for understanding the evolution of the diverse supermassive black hole binary population .",
