    "a common task in quantum technology is that of extracting information about the state of a physical system without destroying the information itself , i.e. possibly leaving part of it for another users .",
    "this is usually accomplished through indirect measurement , i.e. coupling the system of interest with a probe system and performing measurements on the probe @xcite .",
    "the information on the system is thus provided by the probe and the system is not destroyed , though its state may be changed after the measurement .",
    "this measurement strategy may be described in terms of the sole system , neglecting the probe , by tracing out the probe degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure returns a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) on the hilbert space of the system , which describes both the statistics of the outcomes and the state reduction due to the measurement.@xcite for qubit systems the simplest class of povms involves another qubit as probe and depends on @xmath0 free parameters , which describe the initial preparation of the probe qubit , the unitary operator coupling the two qubits , and the projective measurement at the output , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we address the properties of this class of povms as a function of the free parameters .",
    "in particular , in order to obtain information about their typical values , the distribution of povms matrix elements is analyzed for random choices of the free parameters in different ranges .",
    "besides , we analyze in some details the tradeoff between information and disturbance , showing that typical values of the tradeoff are close to optimality and that even using a maximally mixed probe one may still achieve optimal tradeoff .",
    "the paper is structured as follow . in section [ s1 ]",
    "we describe in details the measurement scheme and the range of variation of the free parameters . in",
    "doing this we review the cartan decomposition of two - qubit unitaries and provide the characterization of the povm elements , the so - called _ effects _ @xcite . in section [ s2 ] we analyze the distribution of the povm matrix elements as a function of the free parameters . in section [ s3 ] the quantification of information and disturbance is briefly reviewed and the corresponding distribution of fidelities is studied as a function of the free parameters .",
    "section [ con ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the following scheme of measurement , which exploits a _ probe _ qubit in order to gain information on a _ signal _ qubit . in the first stage",
    "the probe qubit is prepared in a known state and then the signal and the probe are coupled by a unitary operator .",
    "finally , a projective measurement is performed on the sole probe system ( see fig .  [ ms ] ) .    .",
    "in the first step the probe qubit is prepared in a known state @xmath1 , then the signal and the probe are coupled by the two - qubit unitary @xmath2 and , finally , a projective measurement described by the projection - valued measure @xmath3 is performed on the sole probe qubit.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the unitary operator @xmath2 works on @xmath4 , and we assume its determinant to be equal to @xmath5 , in order to have @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to the hilbert space of the system as @xmath7 , while the hilbert space of the probe is @xmath8 .",
    "the state of the probe @xmath9 in the bloch representation may be written as @xmath10 where the bloch vector @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] is the purity of the probe system , and @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 .",
    "the projective measurement , performed on the probe system , is described by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 . since the probe is a qubit , then the projective measurement is composed by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    the unitary operator @xmath6 depends on @xmath22 parameters . in order to reduce this number",

    "clearly , the cartan decomposition does not reduce the number of parameter of @xmath2 , since each local operator depends on 3 parameters .",
    "however , as we will see , for our purposes , the local operators could be neglected .",
    "the measurement scheme given above can be described by a povm on the hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "the operators which compose a povm are often referred to as _ effects_. an effect represents an apparatus with dicotomic outcome ( yes@xmath32no ) .",
    "therefore , each effect of a povm is connected to a single outcome of the apparatus , and gives the probability that its outcome occurs.@xcite . the effects composing this povm",
    "are given by the following equation ( naimark theorem ) : @xcite @xmath33}\\ ] ] notice that , since the pvm on the probe system is @xmath34 , then the povm on @xmath7 is composed by two effects , i.e.  @xmath35 , and it is fully characterized by the matrix elements of @xmath36 .",

    "the analytic expression of the coefficients of @xmath36 is given in the [ a : cote ] , and will be used in section [ s2 ] to characterize the properties of the povm as a function of the free parameters .",
    "as mentioned above , the operator @xmath36 fully describes the povm and , in turn , the measurement scheme .",
    "@xmath36 is an effect , i.e. a bound operator , which is positive , and hence selfadjoint , and with eigenvalues smaller that 1 .",
