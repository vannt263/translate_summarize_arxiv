    "the globular cluster ( gc ) system of our own galaxy provides an obvious test - bed for the integrated spectral properties that we can measure for extragalactic gcs , such as age , metallicity and alpha - element abundance .",
    "it also allows us to test the single stellar population ( ssps ) models that we rely on .",
    "limitations on this approach include the small number of milky way gcs ( @xmath1150 ) , strong extinction to some ( particularly metal - rich bulge gcs ) , a limited age range ( most gcs are @xmath2 10 gyrs old ) and the difficulty of obtaining well calibrated , high s / n spectra . some inroads on the latter have been made by puzia et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and schiavon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . from this combined dataset",
    "we have formed a database of 48 distinct milky way gcs on the lick system with s / n @xmath1 100 .    in proctor , forbes & beasley ( 2004 ) we showed that more reliable results are obtained from using all available lick lines than h@xmath3 or h@xmath4 alone .",
    "recent fits to the combined dataset by j. mendel shows a good agreement with the cmd - derived ages and metallicities of de anglei et al .",
    "however , the trend for alpha - elements with metallicity rises to unrealistically high values at low metallicities ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . given that high resolution spectra of carney and coworkers indicates a near constant [ e / fe ] = + 0.3 for milky way gcs , we suspect this is an ssp modelling effect . we have modified the base ssp model of lee & worthey ( 2005 ) to include the houdashelt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) formulation for alpha - elements .",
    "the refit results are shown in fig .",
    "2  they now reveal the expected trend .",
    "so although preliminary , this approach shows promise .",
    "forbes , brodie & grillmair ( 1997 ) and beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) favoured a formation scenario in which gcs were formed in a dissipative process in the early universe .",
    "both required a mechanism to cutoff or truncate the formation of metal - poor gcs ( which formed first ) before the second phase of metal - rich gc formation occurred .",
    "reionization now seems to be the ` best bet ' process for this truncation ( e.g. santos 2003 ) .",
    "if correct , a fossil record of the epoch of reionization can be found by examining the surface density profile of metal - poor gcs ( moore et al .",
    "2006 ; bekki 2005 ) .",
    "this prospect is particularly exciting given the current constraints of z@xmath5 @xmath1 6 from qsos and z@xmath5 @xmath1 11 from the wmap satellite .",
    "the combination of truncation of metal - poor gc formation and a galaxy mass - to - light ratio that varies with mass , can explain the u - shaped distribution in gc specific frequency with host galaxy luminosity ( forbes 2005 ; bekki , yahagi & forbes 2006 ) .",
    "such bimodality in gc properties with galaxy mass may be explained by the transition from hot to cold flows ( dekel & birnboim 2006 ) .",
    "the most direct way of probing the formation epoch of gcs is to determine gc ages from high s / n spectra .",
    "the sages team have been carrying out such work for several years with the keck telescope .",
    "it appears that the vast bulk of gcs in elliptical galaxies are old , i.e. ages @xmath2 10 gyrs .",
    "an interesting , and controversial case , is ngc 4365 in the virgo cluster . in fig .",
    "3 we show the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) for gcs in this galaxy .",
    "ages and metallicities have been fit using the multi - line method of proctor , forbes & beasley ( 2004 ) by m. pierce with indices from brodie et al .",
    "the amr shows that our sample gcs are all old , i.e. forming at redshifts z @xmath0 2 .",
    "one possible exception ( open symbol ) has a clear calcium h+k ` inversion ' in its spectrum indicative of a blue horizontal branch ; so in this case the age is underestimated and the metallicity overestimated .",
    "in forbes et al . ( 2004 ) we presented amrs for the gcs associated with the accreted sgr and canis major dwarf galaxies .",
    "we further suggested that dwarf galaxy accretion contributed to the increased age dispersion at intermediate metallicities of the milky way gc system , but overall the contribution of accreted gcs was small .",
    "a rare example of a dwarf galaxy ( and presumably its gc system ) in the process of being accreted by a larger spiral galaxy was presented in _ science _ by forbes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "a possible example of accreted gcs in a nearby elliptical galaxy is ngc 4649 ( pierce et al .",
    "the amr shown in fig .",
    "4 reveals that the bulk of the gcs are old , however there are 4 gcs which appear to be young ( @xmath123 gyrs ) ages .",
    "interestingly , these gcs are not all centrally located or on the side of the galaxy towards its nearest neighbour ngc 4647 , but lie in different parts of the galaxy .",
    "we speculate that they may have been accreted from a gaseous dwarf galaxy , of which there is no current sign .",
    "2 gyrs , unlike ngc 1316 . ,",
    "height=377 ]    proto - globular clusters certainly appear to be forming in gas - rich mergers today such as the antennae , but the question remains ` what contribution do gcs formed in recent mergers make to the overall gc system of today s elliptical galaxies ? ' an interesting comparison is the cases of ngc 1316 and ngc 1052 . both are thought to be 13 gyr old merger remnants .",
    "ngc 1316 has a very disturbed morphology with extensive gas and dust .",
    "ngc 1052 has an elliptical appearance with some fine structure ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) , and evidence for hi gas infalling onto the nucleus and in extended tails ( van gorkom et al .",
    "the cmds for the gc systems on these two galaxies , placed at the same distance , are shown in fig .",
    "the ngc 1316 gc system reveals several gcs at intermediate colour and bright magnitudes of 18.5 @xmath6 v @xmath6 21.5 .",
    "the brighter three are confirmed by spectra to be @xmath1 3 gyrs old from goudfrooij et al .",
    "ngc 1052 has no equivalent counterpart gcs ( forbes et al .",
    "2001 ) ; here the cmd distribution of gcs suggests they are predominately old .",
    "subsequent keck spectra of 16 ngc 1052 gcs confirm they are old despite the galaxy having a young central stellar population of @xmath1 2 gyrs ( pierce et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "many galaxies are found to have young central stellar populations , indicative of an interaction or merger which induced some star formation .",
    "if a significant number of gcs are formed during this star formation episode we might expect the mean colours of gcs to correlate with the time since the starburst .",
    "we investigate this issue using early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "6 shows the mean colour of the red and blue gc subpopulations , and their difference , with galaxy ` age ' .",
    "colours come from peng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and galaxy ages from caldwell et al .",
    "the dotted vertical line indicates an age of 12.5 gyrs ( typical of milky way gcs ) .",
    "the solid lines show the change in colour with age for two fixed metallicities , i.e. [ fe / h ] = 0.7 and 1.7 using models from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) . where these intersect the 12.5 gyr line we draw a horizontal line to guide the eye .",
    "the mean gc colours for the red / blue subpopulations and difference do not follow an evolutionary trend as expected if they formed at the time of the galaxy starburst . rather , they have nearly constant colours consistent with them all having an age of @xmath112.5 gyr . thus any gcs formed in a recent merger associated with the galaxy starburst",
    "appear to make little , if any , contribution to the overall gc system .",
    "@xmath7 the ages , metallicities and alpha - element ratios of milky way gcs measured with integrated spectra , and modified ssp models , are in good agreement with cmd and higher resolution spectral results .",
    "+ @xmath7 early formation ( i.e. z @xmath0 2 , age older than 10 gyrs ) is favoured for most gcs .",
    "+ @xmath7 recent accretion is responsible for some gcs in large galaxies today .",
    "+ @xmath7 recent mergers contribute few , if any , gcs to today s elliptical galaxies .",
    "+ @xmath7 reionization is the current best - bet for truncating the formation of metal - poor gcs .",
    "+ @xmath7 the bimodality seen in gc specific frequency mirrors the mass - to - light varations of the general galaxy population .",
