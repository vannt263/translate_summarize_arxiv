    "of the various aspects relevant for solving the unresolved problem of radio emission from pulsars , two are probably the most significant : the actual mechanism of the emission itself , which is still not fully understood ( e.g. zhang 2006 , melrose 2006 ) ; and the effects of viewing geometry and pulsar rotation , which can significantly alter the properties of the pulsar profiles that the observer finally samples .",
    "the latter aspect has received significant attention in the recent years , but much still remains to be investigated .",
    "blaskeiwicz et  al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter bcw91 ) were the first to work out the basic effects of rotation , and showed that the observed asymmetry between the leading and trailing parts of pulsar radio profiles can be due to rotation effects .",
    "further improvements were carried out by hibschman & arons ( 2001 ) , who analyzed the first order effects of rotation on the polarization angle sweep .",
    "later , peyman & gangadhara ( 2002 ) , adapting the method of bcw91 , refined the formulation and showed that the asymmetries due to rotation can be ascribed to the differences in the radius of curvature of the particle trajectories on the leading and trailing sides of the magnetic axis . by analysing the pulse profiles of some selected pulsars ,",
    "which clearly show the core - cone structure in the emission beam , gangadhara & gupta ( 2001 , hereafter gg01 ) and gupta & gangadhara ( 2003 , hereafter gg03 ) showed that the asymmetry in the locations of the conal components around the central core component can be interpreted in terms of aberration and retardation ( a / r ) effects ( combined effects of rotation and geometry ) , leading to useful estimates of emission heights of the conal components .",
    "further refinements of these concepts have been carried out by dyks et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and gangadhara ( 2004 & 2005 , hereafter g04 & g05 ) , dyks ( 2008 ) and dyks et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "all of the above said works have established that rotation effects are of significant importance in understanding the observed emission profiles of radio pulsars .",
    "what has been found wanting is a detailed , quantitative treatment that couples the rotation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere to the possible emission physics and to the emission and viewing geometries , to produce observable radio profiles .",
    "some impediments to this have been recently overcome by thomas and gangadhara ( 2007 , hereafter tg07 ) , who have considered in detail the dynamics of relativistic charged particles in the radio emission region , and obtained analytical expressions for the particle trajectory and it s radius of curvature .    in this paper , we describe a scheme for simulation of pulsar profiles that encompasses a detailed treatment of all the effects mentioned above .",
    "we start with describing the background and motivation for the work (  [ sec : significance ] ) , then go on to the profile simulation method (  [ sec : prof ] ) .",
    "we describe the main results from our study and their dependence on pulsar parameters in  [ sec : results - discussion ] , and discuss how realistic pulsar profiles may be obtained from our model .",
    "we also address the issues of core emission , one - sided or partial cones , and extension of our method to other models of emission physics .",
    "our final conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the charged particles produced in the pulsar magnetosphere are initially accelerated in a region very close to the polar cap , due to the electric fields generated by the rotating magnetic field ( sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; harding & muslimov 1998 ) . after crossing the initial acceleration region",
    "they enter the radio - emission domain where the parallel component of the electric field is screened by the pair plasma , and henceforth they move ` force - free ' . in the rotating frame , the charged particles are constrained to move along the field lines of the super - strong magnetic field , the geometry of which is believed to be predominantly dipolar in the radio emission region ( e.g. , xilouris et  al . 1996 ; kijack & gil 1997 )  the multi - polar components of the pulsar magnetic field are expected to be limited to much lower altitudes close to the stellar surface . the accelerated charges are believed to produce coherent radio emission at specific altitudes in the magnetosphere , by a mechanism that is as yet not fully understood ( e.g. ginzburg et  al .",
    "1969 ; ginzburg & zheleznyakov 1975 ; melrose 1992a , 1992b ; melrose 2006 ) .",
    "though the trajectory of the particles in the co - rotating frame is identical to that of the field line they are associated with , the trajectory will be significantly different in the observer s frame , due to the effect of rotation ( tg07 ) .",
    "the velocity vector of the particles will be offset from the tangent vector of the field line on which they are constrained to move .",
    "the value of the azimuthal angle of this offset is termed as the aberration phase shift @xmath0 which depends on the emission altitude and also on inclination angle @xmath1 and impact angle @xmath2 ( g05 ) .",
    "one consequence of this rotation effect is that the radius of curvature @xmath3 of the particle trajectory becomes significantly different from that of the field line , as shown clearly by tg07 .",
    "this can be intuitively understood as follows : on the leading side , the induced curvature due to rotation has the same sense as the curvature of the field lines and hence the net curvature of the particle trajectory in the observer s frame gets enhanced , resulting in a reduced value of @xmath3 , as compared to that for the corresponding field line . on the trailing side , the curvature of the field lines and the induced curvature due to rotation are in opposite directions , and hence they counter - act to result in a reduced effective curvature ( or a larger value of @xmath3 ) for the particle trajectory .",
    "it was shown in tg07 that the disparity between the values of radii of curvature of field lines and that of the corresponding particle trajectory could be substantial .",
    "for example , for a pulsar with @xmath4 and spin period @xmath5  sec , at an emission altitude of 0.04 of the light cylinder radius ( @xmath6 ) , along a field line with field line constant @xmath7 the ratio of the @xmath3 estimated with and without rotation effects is more than @xmath8 . at an altitude 0.08",
    "@xmath9 the ratio is more than @xmath10 ( see fig .  6 in tg07 ) .",
    "these ratios steeply increase for inner field lines . and indicate that the rotation induces substantial and unavoidable differences on curvature radii and intensity of emission between leading and trailing sides .",
    "further , it was shown in tg07 that the maximum value of the @xmath3 for the particle trajectory , corresponding to field lines either very close to magnetic axis or the ones falling in the meridional plane , including the effects of rotation can be @xmath11 while the maximum of @xmath3 for these field lines in the non - rotating case can attain any value up to infinity .",
    "thus , a proper estimation of @xmath3 for the particle trajectory needs to take into account the effects of rotation .",
    "unfortunately , this consideration has been missing in several works where @xmath3 has been presumed to be identical to that of the dipolar field lines ( e.g. cheng & zhang 1996 ; lyutikov et  al 1999 ; gil et  al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the effects of rotation and pulsar geometry can combine to produce interesting results in observed pulsar profiles , the details of which can depend somewhat on the specific models for the emission process , including that for the distribution of regions producing accelerated charged particles on the polar cap . for our immediate purposes , we use the basic model of nested cones of emission , along with a possible central core , as postulated and demonstrated by several authors ( e.g. , rankin 1983 , 1993a , 1993b ; mitra & deshpande 1999 ; gg01 ; gg03 ) . in such models ,",
    "the source of emission could be in the from concentric rings of sparks produced in the polar vacuum gap , and circulating around the magnetic axis ( e.g. , gil & krawczyk 1997 , deshpande & rankin 1999 , gil & sendyk 2003 ) .",
    "each ring or cone is represented by a narrow annulus of field lines characterised by a definite value of the field line constant @xmath12 appearing in the field line equation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the radial distance to an arbitrary point on the field line and @xmath15 is the magnetic co - latitude .",
    "the set of field lines can also be identified by @xmath16 , the distance from the magnetic axis , of the point where the field line pierces the neutron star surface , normalized to that for the last open field line ( gg01 ) .    in the above model",
    ", if we assume that the charged particles along a given conal set of field lines emit radiation at a given height in the co - rotating magnetosphere , then the simplest effect of rotation and pulsar geometry is to shift this radiation by @xmath17 in pulse longitude on the leading and trailing sides of the profile ( with respect to the magnetic meridian ) .",
    "this is because rotation causes the emission beam to be offset from the local field line tangent in the observer s frame , hence causing the corresponding emission component to be advanced in azimuthal phase by the same amount .",
    "this is the well understood aberration effect which , in combination with the retardation effect , leads to phase asymmetry between the leading and trailing side components associated with a given cone of emission , and has been explored in detail by several authors ( e.g. , gg01 ; gg03 ; dyks & harding 2004 ; dyks et  al . 2004 ; g05 ) .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that the emission mechanism is such that the curvature of the particle trajectory plays an important role in the generation of the radio waves , as would be the case for models related to the curvature radiation mechanism , then rotation effects can produce significant changes in the strength of the intensity profiles on the leading and trailing sides .",
    "this has been indicated by several authors ( e.g. , bcw91 ; peyman & gangadhara 2002 ; tg07 ; dyks 2009 ) .",
    "for example , tg07 have shown quantitatively that the ratio of the total intensity estimated for the same field line with and without rotation effects at an emission altitude of 0.04 @xmath6 is more than a factor of @xmath18 and at 0.08 @xmath6 it is more than a factor of @xmath19 ( see fig .  8 in tg07 ) . in extreme cases",
    ", this effect could lead to almost one - sided intensity profiles . that such effects are seen in profiles of known pulsars ( e.g. ,",
    "lyne & manchester 1988 , hereafter lm88 ) is a strong indicator of the importance of rotation effects .",
    "all this motivates the importance for a method that can estimate the properties of the received emission , after including the effects described above .",
    "the necessity of such a 3d method is pointed out by wang et  al .",
    "a good way to proceed is to simulate the emission properties for a given choice of pulsar parameters and predict the observed profiles that would be seen for a range of the parameter space .",
    "these can then be compared with realistic pulsar profiles to gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved .",
    "we have developed such a scheme , which is described in detail in the following sections .",
    "the ultra - relativistic particles that are constrained to move along the co - rotating magnetic field lines suffer acceleration and hence emit beamed radiation within a narrow angular width of @xmath20 , centered on the direction of the instantaneous velocity vector , @xmath21 .",
    "this emission is aligned with the local tangent vector @xmath22 to the field line in the co - rotating reference frame . however , as mentioned earlier , in the observer s reference frame , the velocity vector is offset from the field line tangent vector ( gg01 , g05 ) .",
    "furthermore , the radius of curvature of the particle trajectory will be different from that of the associated field lines ( tg07 ) . to begin with , for a given pulsar geometry we choose a ring of field lines specified by a single value of field line constant @xmath12 ( or by the equivalent value of @xmath16 ) and look for all possible emission spots along the field line that can contribute in the observer s line - of - sight direction . for the observer to receive significant radiation",
    ", we impose the condition that the unit velocity vector , @xmath23 , should align with the unit vector along the line - of - sight , @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 for any given pulse phase of observation , we find the possible emission spots on the specified ring of field lines that meet this criterion . for each emission spot , we compute the emission altitude , @xmath14 , the emission angles @xmath15 and @xmath26 ( defined in sec .   [ sec : details ] ) , and the radius of curvature of the particle trajectory , @xmath3 .",
    "we then couple the basic curvature radiation model to the above picture , using the value of @xmath3 in order to obtain estimates of the specific intensity that would be seen by the observer at a given pulse longitude .",
    "of the several emission mechanisms proposed for pulsar emission , the curvature emission model is perhaps the most natural and favoured one ( gil et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , as we argue later , our method is flexible enough to incorporate other viable variants of pulsar emission models . using the curvature radiation formulation ,",
    "we compute the intensity that would be seen at @xmath27 observing frequency , @xmath28 , and not just for the characteristic frequency , @xmath29 we sweep the line of sight through discrete rotation phases and , for any given field line , search for the points that contribute at a given @xmath28 , and calculate the emission parameters like emission height , radius of curvature and , finally , the intensity of the radio emission received .",
    "this method allows us to generate a super - set of all possible emission profiles that would be observed at a given frequency .      any emission point in the pulsar magnetosphere",
    "can be located by the coordinates @xmath30 @xmath15 and @xmath26 in a coordinate system where the @xmath31axis is parallel to the magnetic axis @xmath32 , and the @xmath33plane is the plane containing the magnetic and rotation axes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_geo ] ) . this coordinate system can be called as the magnetic coordinates , where @xmath15 and @xmath34 are the magnetic co - latitude and the magnetic azimuth , respectively . this coordinate system co - rotates with the pulsar .",
    "another coordinate system , identified by @xmath35 ( the observer s frame ) , can be defined such that the line - of - sight vector is parallel to the @xmath36plane containing the magnetic axis and the rotation axis at rotation phase @xmath37 and designated as the meridional plane @xmath38 the @xmath39axis is parallel to the rotation axis @xmath40 .",
    "the * @xmath36plane * makes an azimuthal angle @xmath41 with @xmath42 during rotation .",

    "a point of emission on a dipolar field line can be expressed as @xmath47 .",
    "when rotation effects are not included , it turns out to be a trivial exercise to trace emission spots based on the expressions for @xmath48 @xmath15 and @xmath26 . for a given @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath16 combination , the value of @xmath49 $ ]",
    ", the radius of curvature @xmath3 can be readily found ( eq . 4 in g04 ) .",
    "however , the estimation of @xmath14 and @xmath3 corresponding to the emission spot becomes difficult when the effects of rotation are included .",
    "as mentioned before , when rotation is invoked , the observer will receive peak radiation when the particle velocity vector @xmath50 ( rather than the tangent to the field line ) becomes parallel to the line - of - sight @xmath51 , where @xmath52 $ ] , and @xmath53 .",
    "the total velocity of the charged particle will be the vector sum of the component parallel to the magnetic field , and the component in the azimuthal direction due to the co - rotation of the field ( tg07 ) .",
    "the component in the azimuthal direction will make the total velocity offset from the direction of the local field tangent .",
    "the analytical solution for the radial position of the trajectory of the charged particle , including the rotation effects , is derived in tg07 .",

    "the estimates of this method have been optimised by comparison with the estimates of the aforesaid exact method in a common parameter regime where both the methods give reliable results .",

    "an important feature of this method is that it computes the contribution to the observed intensity for any frequency @xmath106 different from @xmath29 often in literature , significant contribution of intensity to the observer is presumed to be concentrated near the characteristic frequency @xmath107 , thus providing an in - built frequency selection criteria ( e.g. , melrose 2006 ) .",
    "however , the spectral intensity curve for curvature radiation has non - negligible amount of power emitted at a significant range of frequencies different from @xmath29 our formulation thus allows for a more complete treatment of the amount of emitted intensity and its reception by the observer .    since our present analysis necessitates only the computation of relative intensities of the simulated profiles , invoking a single particle emission model for the curvature emission do not alter the results in a significant manner .",
    "the high luminosity of the pulsars demands imposing coherence on the emission , perhaps in the form of bunched emitting sources , and the process behind the formation of such bunches is still being investigated . in a simple manner , coherent emission from a bunch with charge q can be alternatively expressed as the emission from a single particle with the same charge q. so , the relative intensities are not affected by this simplification and hence considering single particle emission do not tamper with the physics behind the emission .",
    "further discussions regarding this factor will be followed in later sections .",
    "we have computed the parameters of emission in the magnetosphere by implementing the method described above .",
    "the free parameters are the following : @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( pulsar geometry ) , @xmath108 ( pulsar rotation frequency ) , @xmath98 ( lorentz factor of the particles ) , @xmath16 ( field line location ) and @xmath28 ( radio frequency of observations ) . for the sake of brevity of presentation , we give results for a single fixed value of @xmath109 ( i.e. a spin period of 1 sec ) , and for a relatively narrow range of rotation phases of about @xmath110 to @xmath111 around zero ( fiducial ) phase . as is discussed later , frequency turns out to be a relatively weak parameter in comparison to other strong ones that influence profile evolution .",
    "hence , for the simplicity of analysis , we have restricted the frequency to a single value of 610 mhz . for a chosen pulsar geometry ,",

    "the heights for the allowed emission spots have a minimum value near the magnetic meridian ( @xmath117 ) , with smoothly increasing values on the leading and trailing sides .",
    "however , the variation of height with rotation phase is asymmetric such that the increment with rotation phase is always faster for the trailing side than for the leading side . whereas this increase with rotation phase is purely geometric , the asymmetry in this is due to the modification of particle trajectories produced by rotation . on the leading side , the emission beam bends in the direction favourable to rotation and hence advances in azimuthal phase by @xmath118 from that of the corresponding field line tangent .",
    "hence at a fixed @xmath72 an emission spot located at a lower emission height than in the non - rotating case will satisfy eq.[eq_los_vel ] .",
    "in contrast , on the trailing side , the bending of the emission beam causes a lag in azimuthal phase by @xmath118 from the corresponding field line tangent .",
    "this lag can be compensated by an emission spot located at a different altitude than the non - rotating case .",
    "hence an emission spot located at a different emission height will satisfy eq.[eq_los_vel ] and contribute radiation to the observer .",
    "both the value of the minimum height ( at @xmath117 ) , as well as the asymmetry , are larger for the inner field lines as compared to the outer field lines .",
    "this supports the intuitive expectation that outer field lines would be visible out to much larger pulse longitude ranges than inner field lines .",
    "further , it is seen that the minimum height and asymmetry of the variation increase with geometry , being more for larger values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "also , pulsars with larger values of @xmath1 will have a larger range of variation of allowed emission heights , for the same field line .",
    "it is reasonable to surmise that a similar value of emission height can be seen recursively for several combinations of larger and smaller values of @xmath1 and @xmath119 for a certain @xmath41 .",
    "thus we find that the values of @xmath1 and @xmath16 dominantly decide the range of emission heights .",
    "even otherwise , the @xmath1 dependence of the emission height can be directly understood from eq.([eq_solution_0_order ] ) , since the expression @xmath89 is explicitly dependent on the value of @xmath120      the radius of curvature inferred for the possible emission spots also varies signficantly with rotation phase , and it is significantly asymmetric between leading and trailing sides .",
    "if rotation effects were not considered , this radius of curvature would be same as that of the corresponding field line and be symmetric around zero pulse phase . given that the observed radius of curvature of the particle trajectory is a combination of the curvature of the field line and curvature introduced due to rotation , the observed asymmetry is a rotation effect and can be understood as a combination of two effects : first , as the allowed heights are different on the leading and trailing sides ( for the same phase @xmath121 on either side of the zero phase ) , the radius of curvature of the field line itself would be different ; second , on the leading side , the curvature of the field line gets combined with that induced by rotation ( tg07 ) , resulting in a lower value of the @xmath3 for the particle trajectory .",
    "whereas on the trailing side , the two curvatures are opposed and hence the net curvature is reduced , leading to larger values of @xmath91 in fact , for some field lines , rotation induced curvature can cancel the curvature due to the field lines , at some points on the trailing side , resulting in sharply peaked curves for @xmath3 for certain values of @xmath119 as seen in the plots in figs .",

    "the variation of @xmath3 on the leading side is more or less steady , while on the trailing side it often varies very rapidly due to the aforesaid reasons .",
    "the trend is that the asymmetry seen in @xmath3 will be higher for larger values of @xmath1 and smaller values of @xmath16 and hence it is a combined effect of both . as mentioned earlier , the rotation effects are more at higher @xmath1 and hence the larger asymmetry",
    ". since the range of emission altitudes covered by the emission spots for inner field lines are higher than that of the outer field lines , the corresponding values of @xmath3 also will have a higher range and a higher asymmetry than the ones for the outer field lines .",
    "however , there are variations in the amount of asymmetry with in the field lines when the @xmath1 varies , and hence a steady variation of asymmetry with @xmath1 will not be observed as for the emission heights .    comparing the @xmath122 plots for figs .",
    "[ fig_a60-b1 ] & [ fig_a90-b1 ] , we can find on the leading side that the radius of curvature gets reduced when @xmath1 increases from @xmath123 to @xmath124 for all field lines .",
    "but on the trailing side the behaviour is slightly different . the inner field lines ( @xmath125 )",
    "have the radius of curvature slightly reduced on the trailing side , while an increment in radius of curvature is seen for outer field lines ( @xmath125 ) , when @xmath1 increases from @xmath123 to @xmath126 another comparison of the @xmath122 plots for the figs .",
    "[ fig_a30-b1 ]  &   [ fig_a60-b1 ] obviously shows the same trend for the leading side .",
    "however , the variation of @xmath122 on trailing side shows a slightly different behaviour , varying among field lines .",
    "the variation of @xmath127 on the trailing side is not in a steady pattern as on the leading side .",
    "the competing curvatures due to rotation induced curvature and the intrinsic field line curvature gives a highly varying pattern for @xmath127 on the trailing side .",
    "the derived spectral intensity curves reflect the asymmetry inherited from the variation of @xmath3 with pulse phase , combined with the effects of the value of @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , it is readily seen that the intensity dramatically evolves with @xmath129 for lower values of @xmath98 , the @xmath128 has a stronger leading part while for higher values of @xmath98 the @xmath128 has a stronger trailing part .",
    "this effect can be better understood by considering the parameter @xmath130 ( defined in eq .",

    "[ fig_a30-b1-spec ] where @xmath131 and the corresponding @xmath132 are plotted side by side as a function of the rotation phase , for specific combinations of parameters .",

    "it is interesting to note that in some cases , the intensity on the trailing side can drop to negligible values , compared to its value at the corresponding longitude on the leading side .",
    "this could be a natural explanation for the one - sided cones reported in literature , and is discussed in more detail in  [ sec : partial - cones ] .    for situations where @xmath133 is less than 1.0 for the entire pulse window",

    "the emission heights become less asymmetrical for increasing values of @xmath112 the values of @xmath3 steadily increase with decreasing @xmath16 ( i.e. inner field lines ) on the trailing side .",
    "dramatic effects such as very large , peaked values of @xmath3 on the trailing side , owing to the mutual cancellation of intrinsic and rotation induced curvatures , are seen only on inner field lines .",

    "the profiles are much more symmetric , and since @xmath149 for a significant range of pulse phase on either side of @xmath117 , the profiles more often exhibit minima at @xmath117 , even for moderate values of @xmath98 .",
    "the effect of @xmath98 has a very clear signature on the asymmetry of the spectral intensity profiles .",

    "the sense of this asymmetry can reverse , with trailing side becoming stronger than the leading , and a minima at @xmath117 ; however , the degree of the asymmetry , as measured by the ratio of the intensities at corresponding longitudes , is generally less than that for the case for the low @xmath98 values .",

    "such effects are seen sometimes in some real profiles .",
    "one of the significant results from our simulation studies is that the possible regions of emission associated with a given annular ring of field lines ( characterised by a constant value of @xmath16 ) are visible over a wide range of pulse phase , albeit with different intensity levels .",
    "this aspect , combined with the results for field lines with different values of @xmath16 , leads to the conclusion that a very large fraction of the pulsar magnetosphere is potentially visible to us .",

    "this disparity with the observed profiles persists even after we incorporate into our simulations the models of discrete , annular conal rings of emission .",

    "for example , if a small range of @xmath16 values around the mean is considered , it is easy to argue that much of the width of a profile component can be filled up by radiation from such a bunch of field lines .",

    "one indicator of the significance of the spread of @xmath180 values is the amount by which @xmath180 needs to be changed to move the peak of one conal component to the point half - way to the peak of the next conal component .",
    "not very surprisingly , our rough estimates show that the required change in @xmath180 is close to the half - way point to the @xmath180 value of the next cone , which would indicate a closely packed structure of concentric rings .",
    "the component profiles could be further influenced by considering a distribution of @xmath98 values associated with the emitting particles .",
    "we have found that significant shifts in the peaks of the leading and trailing pair of components for simulated profiles are obtained for lower @xmath98 values ( @xmath181 ) , while the peak positions appear almost frozen for increasing @xmath98 values .",

    "thus , the similarity of the simulated profiles with the observed ones gives an assurance that , we should be able to simulate the observed profiles with greater similitude with a model overcoming the above - said limitations .",
    "the generation of the profile components for psr b2111 + 46 described above naturally leads to a discussion on the core emission .",
    "in fact , the study of the phenomena of core emission has spawned enormous amount of literature .",
    "perhaps the most notable ones are the landmark work by rankin ( 1983 ) that systematized the pulsar emission profile into ` core ' and ` cone ' , and the succeeding works by rankin ( 1993a & 1993b ) that further developed the core - cone classification scheme .",
    "the hollow cone model was invoked to explain the geometry ( e.g. taylor & stinebring 1986 ) and the origin of core emission .",
    "radhakrisnan and rankin ( 1990 ) have conjectured that the emission mechanism for cores might be different from that of cones , owing to the behaviour of polarization position angle curve near the core being different from the rotating vector model . however , there are no satisfactory theoretical grounds for postulating diverse mechanisms for cores and cones . a major difficulty that curvature radiation encounters in explaining the core emission is the insufficient curvature of the almost straight field lines in a region relatively close to the pulsar polar cap .",
    "since the intensity of emission is proportional to @xmath182 , the values of @xmath3 provided by the intrinsic curvature of the field lines is too large and hence insufficient to generate enough intensity of emission typically observed for core component .",
    "this factor even prompted invoking other emission mechanisms for explaining core emission ( e.g. wang et  al . 1989 ) .    in our simulation studies ,",
    "the presence of the core component comes about quite naturally .",
    "it can be seen from all the plots of spectral intensity in  [ app : figs ] that the emission from regions near the profile centre is comparable ( for higher @xmath183 values ) or even somewhat higher ( for lower @xmath183 values ) than that from regions in the wings of the profile .",
    "this happens because we get low values of @xmath3 for inner field lines near @xmath184 , which are comparable to that of outer field lines , and this occurs consistently for all the combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see the panels for @xmath116 in  [ app : figs ] ) .",
    "the reason is that rotation induces significant curvature into the trajectory of particles , even though they are confined to move along the nearly straight inner field lines .",
    "the forces of constraint act in such a way that the particle is hardly allowed to deviate away from the field line on which it is moving , and the resulting scenario is discussed in detail in tg07 . due to the co - rotation of the field lines and the action of the aforesaid forces of constraint the charged particles are added with a velocity component in the direction of rotation , which is nearly perpendicular to the velocity component parallel to the field line , in the observer s frame .",
    "this induces an additional curvature in the trajectory of the particle and makes it significantly different from that of the field line curvature in the observer s frame of reference ( tg07 ) .",
    "hence the trajectory of charge particles moving on almost straight field lines near the magntic axis can have a highly curved trajectory and hence a relatively low value of radius of curvature that is significantly different from that of the field lines .",
    "this scenario allows for significant emission near the central region of the profiles . by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq - tot - spec ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq - mod - spec ] ) appropriately , as described earlier , profile shapes resembling strong core components can be easily generated .",
    "hence by applying our method , we provide a natural explanation for core emission , that circumvents the issue of too high @xmath3 that precludes a strong core component with curvature emission .    in the simulation of the profiles for psr b2111 + 46",

    "assuming the same mechanism of emission , viz .",
    "curvature radiation , for the core and conal component , we are able to produce a simulated core component that matches quite well with the observed profile .",
    "we notice that the best - fit values for the amplification factor @xmath185 found in the simulation for the core component ( table  [ tabsim ] ) are comparable to those of the cones",
    ". these values are not unduly high , considering the situation that the density of plasma should be relatively higher for the lower altitude and hence an additional factor for relatively stronger emission at lower altitudes .",
    "our profile - matching of psr b2111 + 46 thus shows that strong core emission can originate from inner field lines due to curvature emission .      according to lm88 , partial cone profiles are the ones in which one side of a double component conal profile is either missing or significantly suppressed .",
    "these are recognised by the characteristic that the steepest gradient of the polarization position angle is observed towards one edge of the total intensity profile , instead of being located more centrally in the profile as the rotating vector model postulates .",
    "lm88 speculated that this happens when the polar cap is only partially ( and asymmetrically ) active .",
    "it is significant that , out of the 32 pulsars listed in lm88 that display the partial cone phenomena , as many as 22 have the steepest gradient point occurring in the trailing part of the profile . in other words ,",
    "most of the partial cone profiles show a strong leading component and an almost absent trailing component .",
    "cccccccccccccccccccccccccc + & @xmath1 & & & & + & & & & & +    1 & 90 & 1 & 0.3 & 1000 & 200 +   + 2 & 90 & 1 & 0.5 & 1200 & 150 +   + 3 & 60 & 1 & 0.3 & 1000 & 200 +   + 4 & 60 & 1 & 0.5 & 1400 & 150 +   + 5 & 30 & 1 & 0.1 & 2500 & 500 +   + 6 & 30 & 1 & 0.3 & 1000 & 150 +    there are two possible scenarios that have been postulated to explain partial cones : ( 1 ) only a part of the polar cap is active ( this works for both kinds of partial cones ) or ( 2 ) the a / r effects are so large as to shift the entire active region of the intensity profile towards the leading side ( this works for the strong leading type partial cones , which are the majority ) .",
    "however , mitra et  al ( 2007 ) studied several pulsars with partial cones with very high sensitivity observations and found that the almost - absent parts of the cones do flare up occasionally and show emission for about a few percentage of the total time .",
    "this tends to rule out both the scenarios above , and requires an explanation where the intensity is naturally suppressed in one side of the cone .    in our simulation studies , one sided cones appear as a natural by - product .",
    "we notice that for smaller values of @xmath60 inner field lines and lower @xmath98 values , the intensity profile is almost always significantly suppressed on the trailing side , as compared to the leading side .",
    "the reason for this is quite obvious . as explained earlier , the @xmath3 for inner field lines is highly asymmetrical between the leading and trailing sides ",
    "it remains more or less steady on the leading side , while on the trailing side it shoots up to a high value and then falls .",
    "whenever the @xmath3 shoots up such that @xmath186 , the spectral intensity is significantly reduced . on the other hand , on the leading side we mostly have @xmath187 and",
    "hence the spectral intensity is significant there .",
    "for relatively lower values of @xmath74 @xmath130 reduces and hence there is a greater chance of having @xmath186 , while for higher values of @xmath98 , @xmath131 drops down and eventually becomes closer to 1 .",
    "hence the intensity plots shown in  [ app : figs ] are stronger on the leading side at low @xmath98 , and stronger on the trailing side at high @xmath98 .",
    "however , it is to be noted that ( i ) the values of @xmath98 required to achieve stronger trailing side profiles are very high  usually significantly more than 1000 ; whereas , for more typical values of @xmath98 , we get the stronger leading side profiles and ( ii ) the intensity contrast obtained for the stronger leading side profiles is much larger and striking , compared to that for the stronger trailing side profiles .",
    "both these facts argue naturally for a strong preponderance of one sided cones with stronger leading side profiles , as is statistically seen in the results of lm88 .",
    "to further illustrate the idea , we have generated profiles as shown in fig .",
    "[ partial ] that resemble partial cone profiles by using our simulation technique for specific combinations of parameters , which are listed in table  [ tabpar ] .",
    "the thin line curve represents the un - modulated profile , which is simulated by assuming that the emission is uniform all along the field line , while the thick line shows the final modulated profile .",
    "the active region of the final profile is clearly shifted to the leading side , due to the afore said behaviour of @xmath91 the suppression of the intensity on the trailing part in comparison to the leading side is seen in all the plots and is most dramatic for the inner field lines , for low values of @xmath98 , and for large values of @xmath1 .      in this section ,",
    "discuss some of the future possibilities from the present work .",
    "though we have developed a model under certain specific conditions and demonstrated some useful results from the same , it has significant potential for applicability under diverse circumstances and conditions .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath3 of the emission spot are two of the fundamental ingredients for computing the intensity of emission within any model of radio emission for pulsars .",
    "these values , along with other parameters that we have calculated in our method after explicitly taking into account of effects of rotation and geometry , are applicable for any model of radiation that precepts the condition embodied in eq.([eq_los_vel ] ) , i.e. having the radiation beam aligned with the velocity vector and line - of - sight .",
    "thus the present method of computing @xmath14 and @xmath3 is well suited for studying curvature radiation models in vacuum approximation .",
    "the profiles simulated by these models can be compared with the observed ones to check their veracity .",
    "though we have employed single particle curvature radiation formulation , it is well known that this can not explain the extremely high luminosities seen in typical pulsar radio emission .",
    "coherent emission from bunches of charged particles have been argued to be necessary for explaining the high luminosities ( eg .",
    "ginzburg et  al .",
    "1969 , melrose 92 , melrose 2006 ) .",
    "the model of coherent emission constructed by buschauer and benford ( 1976 ) considered relativistic charge and current perturbations propagating through the bunches with n number of charges , which boosted the emission much above typical @xmath188 factor .",
    "further , they have shown that the characteristic frequency will be significantly shifted to higher values than the typical @xmath189 however , the extremely short lifetime of these moving sheets of plasma ( bunches ) made it implausible to radiate , and due to this reason these emission models were almost forgotten . in later years , the possibility of formation of langmuir micro - structures ( solitons ) due to the collective behavior of the plasma brought back the possibility of bunched radiation ( asseo 1993 ) .",
    "it was shown that the radiation from such a bunch could be expressed by just using the classical formula for curvature radiation ( asseo 1993 ) .",
    "melikidze et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) considered the three component structure of charge distribution for solitons in the pulsar magnetosphere and obtained a different spectral intensity distribution from that of the classical formula for curvature radiation .",
    "however , gil et al . ( 2004 ) used single charged bunches of charge q as equivalent to a single particle with the same charge q , to explore the effects of the surrounding plasma on the curvature emission , and showed that sufficient luminosity could be produced from curvature emission that matches with the observed luminosity of pulsars .    as mentioned in the earlier  [ sec : comp - intensity ]",
    "our estimates and results corresponding to altitude , radius of curvature , magnetic azimuth and magnetic colatitude are equally valid for the case of coherent and incoherent emission , as long as the vacuum approximation is invoked .",
    "this is because the peak of the emitted beam will be aligned with the direction of velocity for emission from a source moving at ultra - relativistic speeds , de - facto in vacuum approximation .",
    "hence the premise contained in eq.([eq_los_vel ] ) for the computation of these quantities will remain valid for both of the cases . for the case of a simple model of coherence for a bunch of net charge q , the spectral intensity profile estimated will be similar to that of the emission from a single particle with charge q , and likewise the relative intensity will also be the same .",
    "hence the results that we have drawn upon spectral intensity are valid for the simple case of coherent emission too . however ,",
    "invoking models of coherent radiation with additional features apart from a simple coherent model , may push the intensity estimates to significantly different values and the resulting shape of the intensity profile will be considerably altered .",
    "two such examples are mentioned in the following .",
    "buschauer and benford ( 1976 ) has shown that both intensity profile and characteristic frequency will be altered if the allowance is made for the propagation of a charge and current density wave through the coherent bunch.considering this model we find that it can alter the shape of the computed spectral intensity curve corresponding to a given field line , from that of the present results .",
    "this is mainly because of the reason that characteristic frequency @xmath190 will be shifted to a higher value than in the case of single particle curvature radiation .",
    "another case is the spectral intensity formula for emission from solitons having a three component charge structure ( eq.(12 ) in melikhidze et  al .",
    "2000 ) which also will yield significantly different estiamtes for spectral intensity , from that of the spectral intensity estimated for the single particle emission .",
    "both of these models are treated in the vacuum approximation and hence they satisfy the condition embodied in eq.([eq_los_vel ] ) , i.e. having the radiation beam aligned with the velocity vector and line - of - sight .",
    "this ensures that the method of estimation and hence the results corresponding to altitude , radius of curvature , magnetic azimuth , magnetic colatitude etc . will be applicable for these two cases also .",
    "the only quantity that is altered by the inclusion of these models , from a single particle case , is the spectral intensity estimate .",
    "nevertheless , these models can be quite easily incorporated into our simulation studies , simply by modifying the form of the spectral intensity expression that is used .    in the emission models where the effects of the surrounding plasma are considered",
    ", the peak of the radiation beam may be offset from the velocity vector by a finite angle ( gil et  al .",
    "this requires a modification to the condition in eq.([eq_los_vel ] ) such that @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the value of the angle of offset by which the peak of the emission beam is offset from the velocity vector . coupling this with some modifications to our method",
    "can deliver the values of @xmath14 and @xmath3 appropriate for this case too . the analysis and results that ensue from all of the above said considerations will be discussed in our forthcoming works .",
    "we have developed a method to compute the probable locations of emission regions in a pulsar magnetosphere that will be visible at different pulse longitudes of the observed profile .",
    "the effects of geometry and rotation of the pulsar are accounted in a detailed manner in this method , which is a very useful new development .",
    "our method includes ` exact ' and ` approximate ' techniques for carrying out the estimation of the relevant emission parameters .",
    "the ` approximate ' method is useful for certain extreme regimes of parameter space , and for faster computation of the results .",
    "the misalignment angle , which provides a good check of the accuracy of the computations , shows that our method achieves satisfactory precision .",
    "besides the exact location of possible emission regions , we are able to compute several other useful parameters like the height of emission , and the radius of the particle trajectory at the emission spot , the azimuthal location of the associated field line etc . , for different combinations of pulsar parameters like @xmath1 and @xmath135 further , using the classical curvature radiation as the basic emission mechanism ( which is apt for a debut level analysis ) , we are able to compute the spectral intensity from any emission spot . by assuming a uniform emission all along the field lines , we have estimated the spectral intensity for a range of pulse phase that the line of sight sweeps through .",
    "we have discussed how realistic looking pulsar profiles can be generated from these generalized intensity curves , by assuming specific range of emission heights along specific rings of field lines .",
    "we have illustrated the capabilities of these methods by generating simulated profiles for the test case of the pulsar psr b2111 + 46 , and have shown that fairly good match with observed profiles can be achieved .",
    "we have also shown how further detailed ( and practical ) considerations can help improve this match . we have shown how our results offer a direct and natural explanation for the puzzling phenomena of partial cones that are seen in some pulsar profiles .",
    "our simulations also provide a direct insight into the generation of the core component of pulsar beams .",
    "finally , we have indicated how our method can be extended to incorporate more sophisticated models for the emission mechanism and produce intensity profiles for the same .",
    "these , as well as extension to polarized intensity profiles , will be taken up as future extensions of the work reported here .",
