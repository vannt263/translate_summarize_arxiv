    "accurate knowledge of thermonuclear reaction rates is important @xmath4 in understanding the generation of energy , the luminosity of neutrinos , and the synthesis of elements in stars . due to the coulomb barrier ( height @xmath5 ) of the entrance channel ,",
    "the reaction cross section @xmath6 drops nearly exponentially with decreasing energy @xmath7 .",
    "thus it becomes increasingly difficult to measure @xmath6 and to deduce the astrophysical @xmath8 factor defined by the equation @xmath9",
    "@xmath10    with the sommerfeld parameter given by @xmath11 .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the nuclear charges of the interacting particles in the entrance channel , @xmath14 is the reduced mass ( in units of amu ) , and @xmath7 is the center - of - mass energy ( in units of kev ) . although experimental techniques have improved @xmath9 significantly over the years to extend @xmath6 measurements to lower energies , it has not yet been possible to measure @xmath6 within the thermal energy region in stars .",
    "this region is determined by the gamow energy window @xmath15 ( the gamow peak ) for a given stellar temperature and lies far below the height of the coulomb barrier , approximately at @xmath16 . instead , the observed @xmath6 data at higher energies had to be extrapolated to thermal energies .",
    "as always in physics , such an extrapolation into the unknown can lead to considerable uncertainties .",
    "the low - energy studies of thermonuclear reactions in a laboratory at the earth s surface are hampered predominantly by the effects of cosmic rays in the detectors .",
    "passive shielding around the detectors provides a reduction of gammas and neutrons from the environment , but it produces at the same time an increase of gammas and neutrons due to the cosmic - ray interactions in the shield itself .",
    "a 4@xmath17 active shielding can only partially reduce the problem of cosmic - ray background .",
    "an excellent solution is to install an accelerator facility in a laboratory deep underground @xcite . as a pilot project ,",
    "a 50 kv accelerator facility has been installed @xmath18 in the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) , where the flux of cosmic - ray muons is reduced by a factor 10@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the luna pilot project ( luna = laboratory for underground nuclear astrophysics ) was designed primarily for a renewed study of the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1hereaction ( @xmath20 = 12.86 mev ) in the energy range of the solar gamow peak ( @xmath15 = @xmath21 kev ) for a central star temperature of @xmath22 k. the reaction is a member of the hydrogen burning proton  proton ( pp ) chain @xmath9 , which is predominantly responsible for the energy generation and neutrino luminosity @xmath23 of the sun .",
    "so far , the reaction has been studied down to about 25 kev ( section ii ) but there remains the possibility of a narrow resonance at lower energies .",
    "the hypothesis of a low energy resonance was first advanced @xmath24 as a solution to the solar neutrino puzzle , which in those days was regarded as a deficit of @xmath25b neutrinos .",
    "for this purpose a resonance with @xmath26 21 kev and @xmath27 6 kev was considered @xmath28 as the most favourable case .",
    "experimental data available at that time were not inconsistent with the existence of a resonance with @xmath29=15 - 20 kev and @xmath27 2 kev @xmath30 .",
    "as more data on solar neutrinos became available , it became clear that the deficit of @xmath31be neutrinos is stronger than that of @xmath25b neutrinos .",
    "it was shown @xmath30 that such a pattern of suppression occurs if @xmath26 21 kev .",
    "such a resonance level in @xmath32be has been sought @xmath9 without success by various indirect routes , and it is also not predicted by most nuclear - structure theories .",
    "however , the existence of this hypothetical resonance can be positively dismissed only by direct measurements at the required low energies ( i.e. within the solar gamow peak ) .    for nuclear reactions studied in the laboratory ,",
    "the target nuclei and the projectiles are usually in the form of neutral atoms / molecules and ions , respectively .",
    "the electron clouds surrounding the interacting nuclides act as a screening potential : the projectile effectively sees a reduced coulomb barrier .",
    "this in turn leads to a higher cross section , @xmath33 , than would be the case for bare nuclei , @xmath34 , with an exponential enhancement factor @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the electron - screening potential energy ( e.g. @xmath38 approximately , with @xmath39 an atomic radius ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that for a stellar plasma the value of @xmath34 must be known because the screening in the plasma can be quite different from that in laboratory studies @xmath40 , and @xmath34 must be explicitly included in each situation .",
    "thus , a good understanding of electron - screening effects is needed to arrive at reliable @xmath34 data at low energies .",
    "low - energy studies of several fusion reactions involving light nuclides showed @xmath41 indeed the exponential enhancement of the cross section at low energies .",
    "the observed enhancement ( i.e. the value of @xmath37 ) was  in all cases  close to or higher than the adiabatic limit derived from atomic - physics models .",
    "an exception are the previous @xmath0he+@xmath0he  data ( section ii ) , which show apparently a flat @xmath8 curve down to @xmath42 kev , although the effects of electron screening should have enhanced the data at 25 kev by about a factor 1.2 for the adiabatic limit @xmath37 = 240 ev .",
    "thus , improved low - energy data are particularly desirable for this reaction .",
    "we report here on such new data obtained by the luna collaboration within the solar gamow peak .",
    "preliminary results , which have been published @xmath43 , are superseded by the present report .",
    "the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  reaction represents in the exit channel a 3-body - breakup : if the breakup is direct , one should observe a continuous energy distribution of the ejectiles described by phase - space considerations ; if the breakup follows a sequential process , the energies of the ejectiles are described by 2-body kinematics .",
    "experiments have shown @xmath44 that at energies below @xmath45 mev the reaction proceeds predominantly via a direct mechanism and that the angular distributions approach isotropy with decreasing energy .",
    "the @xmath8 energy dependence observed by various groups @xmath46 represents a consistent picture ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the only exception is the earliest experiment @xmath47 where @xmath8 is lower by a factor 3 to 5 compared to the other experiments ; the discrepancy is most likely caused by target problems ( @xmath0he  trapped in an al foil ) .    the absolute @xmath8 values of refs .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 ( as well as those from the present work , section vi ) agree - at overlapping energy regimes - within experimental uncertainties , while those of refs . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are lower by about 25% , suggesting a renormalization of their absolute scales .",
    "however , in view of the relatively few data points and their relatively large uncertainties  in comparison to the other data sets  it has been suggested @xmath52 to omit these data , without significant loss of information .",
    "we verified that no changes in the @xmath8 fit are appreciable ( within 1% ) by including or excluding the data sets from @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "a reaction mechanism was suggested @xmath53 at low energies , in which a neutron tunnels from one @xmath0he  to the other , unimpeded by the coulomb barrier , up to a radial distance where the nuclei overlap appreciably . in this model ,",
    "a diproton remains and subsequently fissions into 2 protons .",
    "the calculated energy dependence of the @xmath8 factor described well the data ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , thus providing confidence in the extrapolation using a polynomial function ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) :    @xmath54",
    "technical details of the luna setup have been reported @xmath55 . briefly ,",
    "the 50 kv accelerator facility ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) consisted of a duoplasmatron ion source , an extraction / acceleration system , a double - focusing 90@xmath56 analysing magnet ( with adjustable pole faces ) , a windowless gas - target system , and a beam calorimeter .",
    "the energy spread of the ion source was less than 20 ev , the plasma potential energy deviated by less than 10 ev from the voltage applied to the anode , and the emittance of the source was 2 cm rad ev@xmath57 .",
    "the ion source provided a stable beam current of about 1 ma over periods of up to 4 weeks .",
    "the high voltage ( hv ) of the accelerator was provided by a power supply , which has a typical ripple of @xmath58 , a longterm stability of better than @xmath59 , and a temperature coefficient of better than @xmath60 /k .",
    "the air - conditioned laboratory was kept at a temperature of @xmath61 c and a relative humidity of @xmath62% .",
    "the hv of the accelerator was measured with a resistor chain , contained in an air - tight plexiglas tube , and a digital multimeter .",
    "the resistor chain was built as a voltage divider , with fifty 20 m@xmath63 resistors and one 100 k@xmath63 resistor ( temperature coefficient = @xmath64/k ) .",
    "the multimeter ( with a long term stability of @xmath65 per year ) provided the numerical value of the hv measured across the 100 k@xmath63 resistor .",
    "this hv - measuring device was calibrated at the ptb in braunschweig ( germany ) at @xmath66c and @xmath67% to a precision of @xmath65 .",
    "the beam entered the target chamber of the differentially pumped gas - target system ( 3 pumping stages ) through apertures of high gas flow impedance ( c to a in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and was stopped in the beam calorimeter .",
    "the gas pressure in the target chamber , @xmath68 , was measured with a baratron capacitance manometer to an accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "this measurement was absolute and independent of the type of gas used . for @xmath0he  gas ( 99.9% enriched in @xmath0he  ) of @xmath68",
    "= 0.50 mbar pressure , the system reduced the pressure to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath64 mbar in the three upstream pumping stages ; a similar pressure reduction was observed for other @xmath68 values .",
    "the gas composition in the target chamber was monitored with a mass spectrometer .",
    "the @xmath0he  gas was compressed by roots blowers , cleaned efficiently using a zeolite adsorption trap ( cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature ) , and fed back into the target chamber ( gas recirculation ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath68 was kept at a constant value using a needle valve in combination with an electronic regulation unit .",
    "as noted above , the main pressure drop occurred across the entrance aperture a ( 7 mm diameter , 40 mm length , 230 mm distance from aperture b ) .",
    "it was shown that the pressure in the target chamber was essentially unmodified by the gas flow through the entrance aperture a ; thus , the geometrically extended target zone was characterized by a nearly static pressure .",
    "beam - heating effects on the gas density are expected to be less than 0.5% @xmath71 for a maximum @xmath72 mbar @xmath0he  target pressure and the 500 @xmath14a maximum @xmath0he@xmath73 beam current .",
    "the beam current in the target area was determined to an accuracy of 3% using the beam calorimeter ( with a constant temperature gradient ) .",
    "the calorimeter was placed ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) at such a distance @xmath74 from the center of aperture a ( @xmath75 cm ) that angle straggling of the incident beam in the gas resulted in a beam profile smaller than the 200 mm@xmath76 active area of the calorimeter .",
    "the luna facility was equipped with an interlock system , which allowed the system to run without an operator on site .",
    "the duty time of the facility in the chosen running conditions was about 90% , with a weekly service time of 8 h. as the typical beam current in the target area was about 400 @xmath14a , a weekly charge of about 200 cb could be accumulated on the target .",
    "the detection setup for the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  studies had to fulfill the following requirements :    1 .   a high absolute efficiency , in view of the expected reaction rates ( yields ) of about 1 event / day and less ; 2 .",
    "a high rejection of natural radioactivity in the detectors , in the target chamber facing the detectors , and from the surrounding rocks at lngs ( mainly gammas ) ; tests at lngs have shown that commercial si detectors exhibited an intrinsic radioactivity level , which was about 200 times higher than the above reaction yield ; 3 .   a high rejection of electronic noise , in view of the needed running times of several weeks per energy point ; 4 .   a clear separation of the reaction products from those of @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath1he   ( @xmath20 = 18.35 mev ) , due to deuterium contamination in the @xmath0hebeam ( as hd@xmath77 molecules of mass 3 ) and in the gas target ( found to be smaller ) .",
    "this contaminant reaction has a cross section one millionfold higher than that of @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  at @xmath78 kev , mainly due to the barrier ratio @xmath5 ( d+ @xmath0he)/@xmath5 ( @xmath0he  + @xmath0he ) = 0.56 , and thus extremely small deuterium contaminations ( of order 10@xmath79 ) can lead to sizeable event rates .    in order to optimize the detection setup and to understand the resulting spectra for quantitative analyses , a monte carlo program @xmath80 was written to simulate the experiment under realistic conditions .",
    "the monte carlo program produces energy and time spectra of the ejectiles as well as absolute yields , which could be compared directly with data .",
    "various quantitative tests of the monte carlo predictions have been carried out successfully @xmath81 .",
    "a monte carlo simulation @xmath80 of the proton spectrum from both reactions at a beam energy of 50 kev is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] : a ni foil of @xmath0he   and @xmath1he  stopping thickness ( 20 @xmath14 m ) was placed in front of a 1000 @xmath14 m thick si detector ( maximum commercially available thickness at the time of the experimental project : the desirable thickness was 1400 @xmath14 m to stop the 14.7 mev protons from @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath1he  ) ; a deuterium contamination of 10@xmath82 was assumed .",
    "one sees the continuous energy distribution of the protons from @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  and the peak(s ) plus low - energy tail of protons from @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath1he  ( due to incomplete stopping in the detector ) . both proton spectra overlap appreciably leading to large uncertainties in the yield analysis of the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  events ; thus , the single spectra of si detectors did not represent a viable solution .",
    "in addition , singles spectra would not reject the background due to natural radioactivity and electronic noise . by the requirement of proton - proton coincidences between detectors  placed on opposite sides of the beam axis  a unique signature of the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  events could be obtained @xmath49 in the coincidence spectra ; also the background events ( radioactivity and electronic noise ) could essentially be eliminated . however , the price for this unique signature is a reduction of the absolute efficiency , by at least one order of magnitude compared to analysis via single spectra .",
    "therefore , this approach was not followed ; instead the present approach utilized @xmath83-e detectors , in which single proton signals were detected in coincidence between the @xmath83 and e detectors of the telescope . in the detection setup ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) ,",
    "designed according to the indications of monte carlo simulations , four @xmath84e - e telescopes ( placed in a rectangular target chamber ) were arranged around the beam axis : two opposite telescopes each at a distance of 2.7 cm from the beam axis and the two other telescopes each at 3.7 cm ; the distance from the center of the entrance aperture a to the center in front of the telescopes was @xmath85 cm .",
    "the different distance from the center of the up - down and left - right couples of telescopes was due to mechanical constraints .",
    "each telescope consisted of transmission surface barrier silicon detectors with a 0.25 @xmath14 m  thick al layer deposited on both sides of the detectors .",
    "the @xmath86e and e detectors both had an active square area of 2500 mm@xmath76 ; the @xmath86e ( and e ) detector had a thickness of 140 @xmath14 m  ( and 1000 @xmath14 m ) and an energy resolution of 105 kev ( and 55 kev ) at @xmath87 = 5.5 mev . a mylar foil ( 1.2 @xmath14 m  thick ) and an al foil ( 1.5 @xmath14 m  thick ) were placed in front of each telescope ; they stopped the intense elastic scattering yield and shielded the detectors from beam induced light .",
    "this double shielding was proved , in various background runs , to be effective and free from pinhole effects .",
    "the detectors were maintained permanently at low temperature ( about -20@xmath56c ) using a liquid recirculating cooling system .",
    "the @xmath1he  ejectiles from @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  ( @xmath87 = 0 to 4.3 mev ) and @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath1he(@xmath87 = 3.7 mev ) were stopped in the @xmath86e detectors , while the ejected protons from @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  ( @xmath88 = 0 to 10.7 mev ) and @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath1he(@xmath88 = 14.9 mev ) left signals in both the @xmath86e and e detectors of a given telescope ( coincidence requirement ) .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the identification matrix of one @xmath86e - e telescope simulated with the monte carlo program at @xmath89= 50 kev and assuming a deuterium contamination of 10@xmath90 : the matrix reveals a clear separation of the events from both reactions .",
    "standard nim electronics were used in connection with the four telescopes .",
    "the signals were handled and stored using a camac multiparametric system , which allowed for on - line as well as for play - back data analyses .",
    "signals from two or more detectors were considered coincident within a time window of 1 @xmath14s , making negligible the rate of random coincidences .",
    "a pulser was permanently used in all detectors to check for dead time and electronic stability .",
    "the acquisition system also stored concurrent information on experimental parameters ( such as ion beam current / charge , accelerator high voltage , and gas pressure in the target chamber ) via camac scalers .",
    "controls have also been implemented to stop data acquisition if the beam was lost or to reject an event if an error in the data transmission occured .",
    "the system handles safely a data flux of about 500 events / s .    in the analysis of the data , the accepted events from @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  had to fulfill the following 3 conditions :    1 .",
    "the events had to arise from proton - induced @xmath91e - e coincidences in a given telescope ; the coincidence requirement of each telescope essentially eliminated events due to natural radioactivity of the detectors themselves and of surrounding materials ; 2 .",
    "the events had to lie in a closed region of the @xmath91e - e plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , whose borders were first deduced by monte carlo simulations and then fixed in order to cut the electronic noise ; 3 .",
    "a proton event had to occur in only one given e - detector ; events which triggered more than one e - detector were rejected ; this condition reduced significantly events due to the residual electronic noise , but it also rejected some p - p coincidences .",
    "the chosen @xmath91e - e energy region together with the anticoincidence requirement led to an absolute detection efficiency of @xmath92% as determined by the monte carlo program . in the @xmath91e - e region of events from @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , no background events were ever observed at lngs since the installation of the equipment ( january 1994 ) during several  no beam \" and/or  no target \" background measurements ( up to two months running ) as well as during a 10 day run with a @xmath1he  beam and a @xmath1he  target gas . at the bochum laboratory ( earth surface )",
    "a background rate of about 10 events / day was found with the same setup . with the discussed operating conditions the setup sensitivity in terms of cross section values is better than 10@xmath93 b.",
    "although the selected regions in the spectra of the telescopes allow for a clear separation of the events from both reactions ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) , a few protons from the contaminant reaction @xmath0he(d , p)@xmath1hecan hit the detectors near the edges of their active volumes loosing only a fraction of their energy and thus leading to a background rate in the @xmath91e - e region of the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he   events .",
    "the probability of such events was investigated by the monte carlo program as well as by direct measurements using projectiles with @xmath94 = 0.5 ( selected by the 90@xmath56 analysing magnet ) .",
    "the ratio between the background events in the @xmath0he  -@xmath0he  region and those in the clearly separated d -@xmath0he  region (= monitor ) turned out to be ( 0.40 @xmath95 0.04)% .",
    "thus a deuterium contamination equal to 10@xmath79 allows @xmath96(e ) measurements as low as @xmath7 = 15 kev , with a signal - to - background ratio equal to 4 . during the reported experiments the deuterium contamination d/@xmath0he  ranged between @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    "for the isotropic emission of the protons in @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he   ( section ii ) , the number of counts @xmath99 per unit of time arising from a differential length @xmath100 of the extended @xmath0he  gas target is given by the expression    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the @xmath0he  target density in units of atoms/@xmath103 ( derived from the measured target pressure @xmath68 , with a precision better than 1%  ) , @xmath104 is the number of @xmath0he  projectiles per unit of time ( derived from the beam calorimeter , with a precision of 3% ) , and @xmath105 is the absolute detection efficiency of all four telescopes including geometry and the acceptance criteria discussed in section iv .",

    "the luna data have been obtained at energies within the solar gamow peak , i.e. below the 22 kev center of this peak , and represent the first measurement of an important fusion cross section at energies near the center of the gamow peak .",
    "no evidence of the hypothetical resonance can be found in the covered energy range . the observed energy dependence @xmath8 , for bare nuclides @xmath139 and shielded nuclides @xmath140 was parametrized using the expressions @xmath141 @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath37 are fit parameters .",

    "the results are summarized in table ii .",
    "the three methods give compatible @xmath139 values while @xmath37 changes significantly : the methods a ) and b ) give @xmath37 values higher than the adiabatic limit ( 240 ev ) , consistent with observations in other fusion reactions .",
    "it should be noted that fitting the luna data only with method b ) , a screening potential of 490@xmath147 30 ev is obtained .",
    "the difference between observed and predicted @xmath37 values is not understood at present .",
    "therefore we adopted @xmath3 from the theoretical adiabatic screening ( method c ) and derived a further error corresponding to the extreme cases @xmath148 ev ( @xmath149 mev b ) and @xmath150 ev ( @xmath151 mev b ) : @xmath152 where the first two errors arise from statistical and systematical uncertainties , respectively , and the last error from the lack of understanding of electron screening .",
    "the difference between the luna data in the 20.7 - 24.8 kev region and @xmath8 calculated in the adiabatic limit ( i.e. fixing @xmath37=240 ev ) , can be used to estimate upper limits for the strength of a hypothetical resonance located at lower energies . for each measured point",
    "we calculated an `` excess '' s - factor , @xmath153 from :    @xmath154    where @xmath155(e ) are the data given in table i corrected for a 240 ev screening potential and @xmath156 comes from the fit c ) in table ii discussed above .",
    "the excess cross section , integrated in the measured energy interval ( 20.7 - 24.8 kev ) , gives the integral yield :    @xmath157    we may compare this value with the tail of a low - energy resonance integrated over the same energy range . for this purpose , we adopted the following procedure : the resonant cross section , @xmath158(e ) , was described according to the usual breit - wigner expression :    @xmath159    where @xmath160 is the de broglie wavelength , @xmath161 is the statistical factor , @xmath162 is the resonance energy and @xmath163 is the resonance total width . due to the high energies of the protons in the exit channel , the partial width of the resonance decay , @xmath164 ,",
    "was assumed to be energy - independent . for the partial width of the entrance channel , @xmath165",
    ", we used the expression @xmath9 :    @xmath166    where @xmath14 = 1.507 a.m.u .",
    "is the reduced mass,@xmath167 = 4 fm is the nuclear radius and the dimensionless reduced width @xmath168 of the nuclear state has an upper limit of unity ( @xmath168 @xmath169 1 , wigner limit ) .",
    "the penetrability @xmath170 is given by the equation :    @xmath171    and was calculated for s - waves ( l=0 ) using the approximations for the coulomb wave functions , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , given in @xmath174 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath175 1 kev at e @xmath169 25 kev ( for @xmath168 = 1 ) and thus @xmath176 .",
    "equations ( 12),(13 ) and ( 14 ) lead to the expression :    @xmath177    where the constant a contains the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 . its value can be determined by the comparison with the experimental value @xmath178 :    @xmath179    with this functional relation @xmath168 is known for fixed values of the resonance energy @xmath29 and of the total width @xmath180 .",
    "it is then possible to evaluate the reaction rate @xmath181 of this hypothetical resonance and compare it with the non - resonant rate @xmath182 used in standard solar model ( ssm ) calculations .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the calculated ratio @xmath183 as a function of @xmath29 for some values of the total resonance width @xmath180 , assuming a central temperature of the sun of 15 @xmath184 k. the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the reaction rate ratio in the wigner limit ( @xmath168 = 1 ) , which was calculated using equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) .",
    "the @xmath181 values obtained with this procedure are upper limits for the reaction rate due to the hyphotetical resonance . at energies",
    "@xmath185 9 kev one concludes that the presence of a resonance can not account for even a partial nuclear solution of the solar neutrino puzzle @xmath186 .",
    "the same conclusion applies in the energy region between 9 and 20 kev for resonance widths @xmath187 2 kev .",
    "room seems still available for a very narrow resonance in this interval where only direct measurements could rigorously dismiss ( or confirm ) its existence .",
    "for the first time the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  fusion reaction has been studied in an energy region deep inside the gamow peak , i.e. down to 20.7 kev .",
    "this goal has been achieved at the new facility for nuclear astrophysics ( luna ) built in the underground laboratory of gran sasso ( italy).the results obtained so far show that the @xmath8 energy dependence is consistent with the predictions based on an extrapolation from higher energies . the presence of a low energy resonance in the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  reaction , which could have strong effects on the  solar neutrino problem \" , does not emerge from the new data . in the near future",
    "the luna collaboration will extend the measurements down to @xmath188 kev : the foreseen running time here is one year .",
    "definite conclusions with respect to the expected solar neutrino fluxes have to await the results of these experiments . for this next phase a new detection set - up , designed to reduce",
    "the background induced by deuterium contamination in the beam and in the gas target , has been developed and is now in a testing phase .",
    "the electron screening effect , which produces an exponential enhancement of @xmath8 at low energies , can be observed in the new @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  data .",
    "this is a second important result since previous data did not show a clear evidence of the enhancement ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the screening potential seems to be higher than the value predicted by the adiabatic model of the interaction between projectile and atomic electron clouds .",
    "it should be noted that the adiabatic approximation , among other electron screening models , is that giving the highest screening potential .",
    "a better quantitative determination of the screening potential will be possible when the luna collaboration will reach the lowest energy scheduled for the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he  experiment .",
    "hopefully , a complete and clear picture of the screening effect will be possible when data collected at very low energies and for other fusion reactions are available .",
    "this is one of the future goals of the luna collaboration .",
    "the excess of the screening potential could also be explained as a tail of a narrow resonance lying in the not measured low - energy region .",
    "upper limits for the strength of such a resonance have been calculated assuming the adiabatic limit for the screening potential .",
    "unfortunately , these calculations can not exclude the existence of a narrow resonance ( width < 2 kev ) at energies between 9 and 20 kev with a strength high enough to give a sizeable contribution to the @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath1he   reaction rate in our sun .",
