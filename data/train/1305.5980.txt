    "the inclination angles between the normal axis of the accretion disk and the line of sight are assumed to be @xmath47 for 3c  206 ( type-1 ) and @xmath48 for pks 070735 ( type-2 ) .",

    "this is consistent with the result by @xcite using _",
    "einstein_. we thus analyze the spectra of 3c  206 by neglecting any emission from the cluster of galaxies .    for the spectral fit of 3c  206 , we utilize the data of xis - fis in the 112 kev band , xis - bi in the 18 kev band , and _ swift_/bat in the 14195 kev band ; because the xis spectra show a soft excess below @xmath501 kev over a power law extrapolated from higher energies , we do not include the xis - bi spectrum below 1 kev in the broad - band spectral analysis to avoid complexity .",
    "possible origins of the soft excess will be discussed later in this subsubsection .",
    "first , we apply a simple model consisting of a direct continuum and its reflection component only from the torus , expressed as * `` phabs ( constant zpowerlwzhighect + pexmon ) '' * in the xspec terminology . here",
    "the `` constant '' factor is introduced to represent the time variability between the _",

    "we obtain the best - fit photon index of @xmath51 and reflection strength from the torus of @xmath52 relative to the time averaged flux of the direct component determined by _",

    "next , we adopt a model expressed as * `` phabs ( constant ( zpowerlwzhighect + rdblurpexmon ) + pexmon ) '' * , adding the reflection component from the accretion disk to the previous model to achieve a physically consistent picture , even though the previous fit without the disk reflection is acceptable in terms of the chi - squared value . since it is difficult to determine the strengths of the two reflection components independently from our data , we fix only that of the disk component .",
    "according to the calculation by @xcite , the equivalent width of the iron - k line is predicted to be ew@xmath54 = 1731 ev for an accretion disk truncated at @xmath55 for a power - law photon index of 1.71.9 .",
    "here we assume an inclination angle of @xmath47 and scale height of the irradiating source of 10 @xmath56 .",
    "we then estimate the corresponding reflection strength of @xmath57 in the * pexmon * model so that the predicted equivalent width ( 1731 ev ) is consistently reproduced .",
    "thus , we fix @xmath58 for the reflection component from the accretion disk .",
    "we find that the _",
    "suzaku_and bat spectra of 3c  206 favor this model with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) over the single reflection model , although the difference in the chi - squared value , @xmath61 , is not highly significant .",
    "we obtain the best - fit photon index of @xmath51 and reflection strength from the torus of @xmath62 relative to the time averaged flux of the direct component determined by _ swift_/bat .",
    "emission from the jets may be contained in the x - ray spectra of radio - loud agns . to estimate the jet contribution in the x - ray band , we utilize the radio luminosity in the agn core , which is attributable to the emission from the innermost region of the jet . according to the unified scheme of agns @xcite ,",
    "radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies are intrinsically the same populations of blazars except that the jet axis is not aligned with the line - of - sight .",
    "thus , from the observed radio luminosity , we can estimate the broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the jet emission in ( non - blazar ) radio - loud agns , by referring to averaged seds of blazars given as a function of radio luminosity ( the so - called blazar sequence ) after correcting for relativistic beaming .",
    "the observed sed from an emitter moving with a relativistic velocity of @xmath63 shifts toward higher frequencies by a beaming factor of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the angular separation from the line - of - sight ) , and toward higher luminosities by @xmath69 ( section 5.8.1.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by assuming the inclination angle of @xmath70 and the jet velocity of @xmath71 for type-1 radio - loud agns , the beaming factor of 3c 206",
    "is estimated to be @xmath72 = 0.52 .",
    "typically , @xmath73 in blazars @xcite .",
    "then , we can convert the sed of typical blazars into that of 3c 206 by multiplying a factor of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the frequency and luminosity , respectively .",
    "using the blazar seds given in @xcite and the radio luminosity of 3c 206 ( @xmath76 ergs@xmath1at 5 ghz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that the intrinsic sed of the jet emission in 3c  206 correspond to those of the 3 most - luminous blazar classes in figure  10 of @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the observed x - ray luminosity from the jet in 3c  206 should be @xmath77 ergs@xmath1at 1 kev , which is @xmath3120% of the total observed flux , and the spectrum is approximated by a power law with a photon index of 1.21.4 in the x - ray band below 100 kev .",
    "note that when we assume an inclination angle of @xmath78 ( @xmath72 = 1.72 ) , the jet luminosity is estimated to be @xmath79 ergs@xmath1at 1 kev , which is @xmath80 times higher than the total observed flux .    to take into account the jet emission ,",
    "we add a power law to the spectral model described above . considering a large uncertainty in the predicted luminosity of the jet component",
    ", however , we fix the photon index at 1.3 but set the normalization to be a free parameter . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the flux ratio between the jet ( power law ) and the direct component from the disk ( cutoff power law ) did not change between the _ suzaku_and _ swift_/bat observations .",
    "the final model , which is shown in figure  [ fig_3c206_spec ] , is expressed as * `` phabs ( constant ( zpowerlwzhighect + rdblurpexmon + zpowerlw ) + pexmon ) '' * , where the constant factor takes account of flux variation between the two observations , and the first to fourth terms represent ( 1 ) the direct component , ( 2 ) the reflection from the accretion disk , ( 3 ) the jet component and ( 4 ) that from the torus , respectively .",
    "we confirm that this model including the jet emission well reproduces the broad band spectrum in the 1200 kev band ( @xmath81/dof = 818.0/824 ) . besides the requirement from the consistency with the radio core luminosity",

    "<S> we present the results from broad - band x - ray spectral analysis of 3c  206 and pks  070735 with _ suzaku _  and _ swift_/bat , two of the most luminous unobscured and obscured radio - loud active galactic nuclei with hard x - ray luminosities of @xmath0 ergs@xmath1  and @xmath2 ergs@xmath1(14195 kev ) , respectively . based on the radio core luminosity </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that the x - ray spectrum of 3c  206 contains a significant ( @xmath3 60% in the 14195 kev band ) contribution from the jet , while it is negligible in pks  070735 . </S>",
    "<S> we can successfully model the spectra with the jet component ( for 3c 206 ) , the transmitted emission , and two reflection components from the torus and the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection strengths from the torus are found to be @xmath4 and @xmath5 for 3c  206 and pks  070735 , respectively , which are smaller than those in typical seyfert galaxies . utilizing the torus model by ikeda et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) , we quantify the relation between the half opening angle of a torus ( @xmath6 ) and the equivalent width of an iron - k line . </S>",
    "<S> the observed equivalent width of 3c 206 , @xmath7 71 ev , constrain the column density in the equatorial plane to @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath10 , or the half opening angle to @xmath11 if @xmath8@xmath12 @xmath10  is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> that of pks  070735 , @xmath13 ev , is consistent with @xmath8@xmath14 @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the tori in luminous radio - loud agns are only poorly developed . </S>",
    "<S> the trend is similar to that seen in radio - quiet agns , implying that the torus structure is not different between agns with jets and without jets . </S>"
