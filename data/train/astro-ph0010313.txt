    "several studies of hot da white dwarf stars have revealed highly ionized species at non - photospheric velocities . while shifted features in the spectrum of feige 24 could be explained by the binary nature of this system ( dupree & raymond , 1982 ) , _ iue _ observations of the isolated da white dwarf cd -3810980 revealed si and c absorption features at velocities displaced by -12 km / s with respect to the photospheric velocity .",
    "these features have been explained in terms of a dense gaseous halo in close proximity to the star ( holberg , bruhweiler & andersen ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "we have examined high resolution euv spectra of five hot ( t@xmath0 k ) da white dwarfs , listed with their basic physical parameters in table 1 .",

    "we compare the velocity of each component to that of the line - of - sight ism lines observed in the spectra , and to the velocity of the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) . using stellar models ,",
    "gravitational redshifts are estimated to determine whether these shifted components could be produced by material within the gravitational well of the star , and column density estimates are derived to provide further information on the nature of the material . in the case of wd 2218 + 706 , a possible link to a large molecular complex is suggested .",

    "all spectra were obtained using the stis instrument on hst , configured with the e140-m grating , and cover the wavelength range from 1150   - 1750   at a resolution of 0.042   fwhm .",

    "re 1738 + 665 is the hottest da white dwarf to be detected by _ rosat _ , as described by barstow et al .",
    "we determine a photospheric velocity @xmath5 km / s based on absorption features arising from fe , ni and o which show no multiple components ; interstellar lines indicate a line - of - sight ism velocity of @xmath6 km / s .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of the lic is estimated to be @xmath7 km / s .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) shows the  resonance doublet in re 1738 , with shifted components at @xmath8 km / s dominating the 30 km / s photospheric contribution",
    ".    shifted features with similar velocities are determined for several other species , although in each case the photospheric component is dominant .",
    "the  doublet shows clear evidence of multiplicity , with non - photospheric velocity components observed at -17.7 @xmath9 km / s .",
    "viewed individually , the lines of the  doublet ( 1238.821 and 1242.804  ) show no evidence of companions , but co - addition of these features suggests an extra , weak line at @xmath10 km / s .",
    "the  doublet ( 1338.612 and 1343.512  ) shows no additional features , but the  line at 1371.292   is accompanied by a weak shifted component at @xmath11 km / s .",
    "our estimation of the gravitational redshift of this star is @xmath12 km / s .",
    "given uncertainties in this estimate and in the velocity of the shifted components , @xmath13 is comparable to the velocity of these components , suggesting that the material does not reside within the gravitational well of the star .",
    "re 1738 exhibits shifted features in several species , at velocities consistent with the line - of - sight ism velocity .",
    "it is therefore possible that these lines may be produced as a consequence of photoionization of material passing through the strmgren sphere as the star moves through the ism .",
    "we determine @xmath14 km / s and @xmath15 km / s which , considering the proximity of this star , is unsurprisingly close to v@xmath16 ( @xmath17 20.6 km / s ) .",
    "although not as clearly separated as the features in re 1738 , both lines of the  doublet are accompanied by a shifted component , the parameters of which have been estimated by fitting multiple gaussians to the data as illustrated in figure 1 ( right ) .",
    "the component at photospheric velocity is of greater equivalent width , and the shifted elements are observed at velocities of @xmath18 km / s . however , there is no evidence for corresponding features in any of the other lines examined .",
    "we determine @xmath19 km / s from stellar models , in agreement with the value of @xmath20 km / s estimated by reid & wegner ( 1988 ) . as in the case of re 1738",
    ", this figure is comparable with the velocity difference between photospheric and shifted high ionization features , suggesting that the non - photospheric material probably resides outside the limit of the potential well .",
    "however , the velocity is substantially different to @xmath21 , and thus photoionization of the cloud responsible for the primary ism lines is not a viable explanation for these features .",
    "no evidence exists for the presence of a planetary nebula surrounding this object , but we note observations by green , bowyer and jelinsky ( 1990 ) who describe the possible detection of a  @xmath22584.3 emission feature in the stellar spectrum , postulating the existence of a hidden companion star or compact ( @xmath23 au ) circumstellar nebula as potential explanations for the line .",
    "we estimate @xmath24 km / s , @xmath25 km / s and @xmath26 km / s .",
    "lines of the  and  doublets are clearly multiple , dominated by a photospheric contribution , but with companion features of comparable equivalent width at a velocity of @xmath27 km / s .",
    "wd 2218 is surrounded by an old planetary nebulae , and is discussed under the alternative designation deht 5 , by napiwotzki and schnberner ( 1995 ) .",
    "the shifted components observed in this star are found at a velocity redward of the photospheric lines , suggesting that this material may be infalling ; gravitational redshift therefore provides no viable explanation .",
    "however , dgani and soker ( 1998 ) show that in regions where the ism is reasonably dense ( such as the galactic plane ) , rayleigh - taylor instabilities can develop in the outer regions of planetary nebulae , leading to fragmentation of the halo , and allowing the surrounding ism to pass into the inner regions of the nebula where photoionization can occur .",
    "although wd 2218 is out of the galactic plane ( @xmath28 ) , kun ( 1998 ) describes the morphology of a nearby giant molecular cloud complex consisting of a large number of distinct regions previously identified in independent surveys ; several are found close to wd 2218 , and two are of particular interest ( lynds-1217 and lynds 1219 ) .",
    "the central portions of these clouds have galactic coordinates within less than 0.5of wd 2218 , and their distance limits ( from 380 to 450 pc ) encompass the distance to wd 2218 ( 440 pc , from napiwotzki & schnberner ) .",
    "this raises the possibility that the star may lie in an area where the ism is particularly dense , allowing instability and inflow to take place ( curve of growth analysis of the non - photospheric  features suggests a column density of @xmath29 @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , in the absence of less equivocal evidence , this explanation must be regarded as conjecture .",
    "alternative explanations , such as the presence of a hidden companion , are also deserving of investigation , and this work is currently in progress .",
    "feige 24 is a white dwarf+red dwarf binary system , and several detailed studies of this object have already been published ( e.g. dupree & raymond ( 1982 ) and vennes & thorstensen ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "vennes & thorstensen estimate a systemic velocity of @xmath31 km / s derived from absorption line measurements .",
    "we determine @xmath32 km / s , @xmath33 km / s and @xmath34 km / s for the white dwarf .",
    "multiple components are observed only in the  doublet , with dominant elements at the photospheric velocity , and secondary features at a velocity of @xmath35 km / s . our gravitational redshift estimate ,",
    "@xmath36 km / s , is somewhat higher than that derived by vennes & thorstensen ( @xmath37 km / s ) , but is still too low to explain the secondary  features",
    ". shifted components in the  doublet of feige 24 have already been discussed by dupree & raymond , while vennes & thorstensen investigated the possibility that this material resided either in the photosphere , in a circumstellar shell , or in a wind from the red dwarf companion .",
    "we note that the velocities of the shifted  features agree , within error , with the ism velocity , and hence a link between the star and its immediate surroundings ( beyond any circumstellar shell ) can not be discounted .",
    "however , vennes & thorstensen also estimate that a  column density ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xmath30 , ( corresponding to equivalent widths for the @xmath221550 line of between 4 - 400 m ) , would be consistent with mass loss from the red dwarf companion .",
    "although insufficient data is available to derive an unambiguous  column density in this study ( figure 2 ( right ) ) , the range of possible values we obtain includes the estimates of vennes & thorstensen .",
    "furthermore , the equivalent width of the @xmath221550 line is measured as 24 m , consistent the earlier estimates .",
    "clearly , much work remains to be done to improve our understanding of this system , and the recent release of a second stis spectrum , taken at the opposite quadrature point , is a valuable addition to the available data .",
    "we determine @xmath40 km / s , @xmath41 km / s and @xmath42 km / s . in common with feige 24 and g191-b2b , this object shows evidence of non - photospheric components only in the  doublet , at a velocity of @xmath43 km / s .",
    "our gravitational redshift estimate suggests @xmath44 km / s , so that re 0558 is the only star in our sample with shifted high ionization features that could be formed by material _ within _ the potential well , rather than the weakly shifted outer regions .",
    "however , the highly ionized , non - photospheric features lie at the velocity of the ism , providing another possible explanation for the observations .",
    "these results represent the early stages of an ongoing study to determine the origin of non - photospheric high ionization features in five hot da white dwarf stars . in re 1738 + 665",
    ", the features appear consistent with the line - of - sight velocity of the ism , and may be produced by photoionization of the ism within the strmgren sphere around the star .",
    "wd 2218 + 706 is the only object to show features which are redshifted with respect to the photosphere , suggesting an infall of material .",
    "we highlight the existence molecular clouds near this star , which may be responsible for fragmentation of the nebula surrounding wd 2218 + 706 , with material subsequently streaming into the strmgren sphere .",
    "the remaining three objects show shifted features only in the  doublet .",
    "photoionization of the ism or mass loss from a k - dwarf companion star are plausible explanations in the case of feige 24 , as supported by  column density estimates .",
    "similar features in g191-b2b are apparently unrelated to the ism , and currently remain unexplained in terms of established properties of the system . in only one case ,",
    "re 0558 + 165 , does gravitational redshift provide more than a marginal explanation for secondary components in the  doublet",
    ". however , no explanation is yet available for the existence of  features to the exclusion of other species in these three objects .",
