    "for a number of years , i have surprised my physics students ( in both introductory and graduate physics classes ) with a `` simple '' question : what is sine ? or in extended form : how do we define the sine function that appears everywhere in physics ?",
    "such questions usually elicit amusement , perplexity , and entertaining statements such as `` the sine function need not be defined because it is well known . ''",
    "discussions that follow the initial puzzled reactions are quite illuminating and inevitably lead to the question of what properties of trigonometric functions can be easily derived from others without prior knowledge .",
    "for example , if we start with the geometrical definition of the sine and cosine functions that uses right triangles ( as it appears in vector analysis ) , can we show that the function defined this way has the property that @xmath0 , as in harmonic motion ?",
    "this manuscript addresses the equivalence between the geometrical and the differential definitions , first mathematically , and then in connection with circular and harmonic motion .",
    "this approach can help students enhance their ability to think abstractly in addition to acquiring more insight into trigonometric functions .",
    "consider a unit circle as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) which shows the projection of the radius op on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes . these projections are functions of the arc length @xmath3 . assuming no apriori knowledge on trigonometric functions",
    ", we would like to show that the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are harmonic , meaning that @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the derivative is taken with respect to @xmath3 .    before doing that , let s ask what can be said about @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as defined on the unit circle .",
    "the most obvious property is the circle equation @xmath8    does this equation alone specify the sine and the cosine ?",
    "the answer is no , although a number of familiar properties follow immediately from it , such as ( 1 ) both functions are bounded with values between -1 and 1 , and ( 2 ) when @xmath1 is maximum or minimum , @xmath2 is zero , and vice versa . to specify the sine and the cosine , a second relationship is needed as shown below",
    "this second relationship is obtained geometrically , ( almost ) like the first .",
    "consider a small displacement from p to p over a distance @xmath9 along the unit circle , as shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 projections change by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath12 divide by @xmath13 to get @xmath14 or in short notation , @xmath15 we can now manipulate eqs .",
    "[ eq : sq1 ] and [ eq : sq2 ] to obtain @xmath6 as follows .",
    "differentiate eq .",
    "[ eq : sq1 ] to obtain @xmath16 squaring the last equation gives @xmath17 in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be substituted from eq .",
    "[ eq : sq1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : sq2 ] , respectively .",
    "we obtain @xmath20 which reduces to @xmath21 differentiating this last equation gives @xmath22 and since @xmath23 is not identically zero , it follows that @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding equation for @xmath2 is obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "note that the result in eq .",
    "[ eq : xsq ] implies that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , showing that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 functions are derivatives of each other as expected .",
    "furthermore , from @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we obtain @xmath27 and in general @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the @xmath31-derivatives of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "we consider two real functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the following two properties : @xmath32 and ask whether a convenient geometrical representation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 exist ( other than a plot vs. the variable @xmath3 ) . by direct differentiation , it can be shown that @xmath33 and @xmath34 which brings us back to the unit circle as a possible representation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 by choosing the constants to be equal to 1 .",
    "in the above development , we have used the variable @xmath3 to represent the length of arcs along the unit circle .",
    "if we consider an object moving around the circle with constant speed @xmath35 , then the geometrical variable @xmath3 is proportional to physical time @xmath36 through the speed @xmath35 , @xmath37 and @xmath38    using the standard dot notation for derivatives with respect to @xmath36 , we have @xmath39 note that @xmath40 and @xmath41 have units of speed as expected , while @xmath23 and @xmath42 are dimensionless .    eq .",
    "[ eq : sq2 ] then expresses the fact that @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , using the second derivatives of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we should recover the known expression @xmath44 for acceleration . to do this",
    ", we need to reintroduce the radius of the circle into equations .",
    "following the same derivation steps as above , it can be shown that @xmath45 the last relationship follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : xsq ] which becomes @xmath46 giving @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 so that the magnitude of the ( centripetal ) acceleration is @xmath50      why bother with derivations that make no explicit use of trigonometric functions ?",
    "after all , trigonometric functions are well known and well established and allow for more elegant derivations .",
    "there are at least two different perspectives that are worth considering . from a mathematical perspective",
    ", the question of possible characterizations of sine and cosine functions has received significant interest . in this context ,",
    "characterization of a function means finding a property that is obeyed only by that function .",
    "different characterizations of the same function must therefore be equivalent .",
    "interested readers are directed to more advanced material in references 9 - 12 . from a physics perspective ( in kinematics to be more precise ) , we have seen that the connection between geometrical and differential definitions of sine and cosine functions corresponds to the familiar connection between circular and harmonic motions at a more fundamental level than commonly presented in textbooks .",
