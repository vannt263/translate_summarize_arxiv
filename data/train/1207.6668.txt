    "the ability to probe experimentally the spin - structure of nuclear wave functions and , in particular , to identify and quantify spin - singlet , @xmath0=0 , nucleon - pair components is a long - standing ambition .",
    "low - energy two - nucleon transfer studies between light - ions , such as the ( p , t ) reaction , studied extensively as such a probe for stable nuclei and , more recently , for exotic nuclei , are discussed in several chapters in this volume @xcite . in such reactions",
    "the light - ion transfer vertex , here @xmath1p@xmath2t@xmath3 , selects , predominantly , @xmath0=0 two - neutron pairs ( specifically , @xmath4 , @xmath5=1 configurations ) from the projectile ground - state wave function ; as is most transparent under the assumption that the reaction proceeds as a direct one - step pair transfer .",
    "intermediate - energy two - nucleon removal reactions offer a relatively new and developing experimental approach .",
    "the reactions have developed out of the need for efficient detection and use of a more restricted set of observables in experiments with rare isotope beams .",
    "the usually highly - unstable projectile nuclei of mass @xmath6 + 2 are produced as fast , low - intensity secondary beams by fragmentation and fragment separation .",
    "the beams , typically with incident energies of @xmath780 mev per nucleon and @xmath8 , collide with light target nuclei , e.g. beryllium or carbon .",
    "our interest here is in collision events that remove two nucleons ( 2n ) with and without inelastic excitation of the target nucleus .",
    "these 2n removal events populate the ( bound or unbound ) ground and excited states of the mass @xmath6 projectile - like residual nuclei .",
    "measurements of the yields and final momenta of these forward - travelling residues also probe aspects of the structure and 2n correlations in the projectile wave function .",
    "this chapter discusses this dependence of 2n - removal reaction observables on the structure and also the spin @xmath0 of the 2n pair .",
    "the observables discussed are inclusive with respect to the fate and final states of the target and of the removed nucleons .",
    "we comment briefly later on the potential of future data , when more exclusive measurements of these reaction fragments become practical .",
    "the present developments have evolved from first investigations whose focus was one - neutron removal from halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "narrow parallel ( beam - direction ) residue momentum distributions were observed@xcite , characteristic of the last weakly - bound neutron occupying single - particle states of low orbital angular momentum @xmath9 . more generally , these momentum distribution widths increase with both @xmath9 and the separation energy of the removed nucleon@xcite permitting an assessment of structure model predictions of e.g. level orderings and single - nucleon spectroscopic strengths@xcite from measured final - state exclusive yields and the residue momenta .",
    "our focus is on 2n removal reactions for structure studies of exotic nuclei@xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the reaction , developed to incorporate correlated shell - model 2n overlap functions@xcite , has been used to formulate the momentum distributions of these reaction residues @xcite and their sensitivity@xcite to nuclear structure .",
    "we will discuss how , although the removal reaction mechanism makes no intrinsic selection of the spin @xmath0 of nucleon pairs at the projectile surface , the 2n removal events are highly selective geometrically , probing the 2n joint - position - probability @xmath10 appropriate to a given final state @xmath11 .",
    "it follows that pair removal is enhanced when nucleons have a spatial ( proximity ) correlation in the projectile ground - state .",
    "the dimensions of the probed volume are of the same size ( 23 fm ) as has been predicted@xcite for cooper pairs at the nuclear surface .",
    "we review the salient points of the two - nucleon removal reaction formalism , developed in refs .",
    ", to make clear the connection between structure , residue yields , and their momentum distributions .",
    "we assume transitions from the projectile initial state @xmath12 , with spin @xmath13 , to particular residue final states @xmath11 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the residues are assumed to be spectators in the sudden reaction description@xcite and the states @xmath11 are not coupled to the reaction dynamics .",
    "the structure input to the reaction is determined by the projectile and residue 2n overlaps @xmath15_{i\\mu}^{t\\tau } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath16 runs over the set of contributing spherical configurations @xmath17 of the two - nucleons , with @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 are the two - nucleon amplitudes ( tna ) for each configuration for total angular momentum @xmath20 and isospin @xmath5 of the two nucleons and a given @xmath21 transition .",
    "the square bracketed term is the antisymmetrized 2n wave function written in @xmath22-coupling .",
    "truncated - basis shell - model calculations have , thus far , provided the structure input , via the tna , giving good agreement with measured final state branching ratios@xcite for nuclei in the @xmath23-shell .    in the following we identify in some detail the role of the 2n spin @xmath0 in the calculations and the observables .",
    "thus we reexpress the overlap and subsequent derived properties in @xmath24-coupling@xcite . the coherence or otherwise of the reaction observables to the different @xmath24 terms in the overlaps",
    "is clarified through the associated 2n joint position probabilities @xmath10 .    when assuming eikonal reaction dynamics the probabilities for absorption ( @xmath25 , an inelastic event ) or transmission ( @xmath26 , an elastic event ) of a fragment @xmath27 ( the nucleons or the residue ) in a collision with the target are @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29=|s_p(b_p)|^2 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the fragment - target elastic s - matrix at its impact parameter @xmath31 .",
    "these factors , due to the effects of strong absorption in the @xmath32 , have the property that @xmath33 and @xmath34 at small impact parameters .",
    "this leads to a natural surface localization of the 2n removal reaction events where the mass @xmath6 residue is transmitted and two nucleons are found sufficiently close together that both interact strongly with the light ( small ) target nucleus and are removed from the projectile .    furthermore ,",
    "if the @xmath35 factors are spin - independent , as is assumed here , then the 2n removal cross section and its differential with respect to the residue momenta involve only the squared modulus of the 2n overlap summed over the two nucleons , residue and projectile spin projections @xcite @xmath36 so , a transition to a given final state @xmath11 will probe the details of this @xmath37 , specifically , the degree of 2n spatial correlations at the projectile surface .",
    "this joint - probability is incoherent with respect to contributions from different @xmath20 , @xmath38 and @xmath0 .",
    "its dependence on the 2n correlations is best presented in terms of radial and angular correlation functions .",

    "the @xmath41 are the @xmath24-coupled tna @xmath42 here @xmath43 describes the radial correlation of the active single - particle states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the analogous exchange term @xmath46 .",
    "the 2n angular correlations , @xmath47 , are independent of @xmath0 and are determined only by the active orbital set @xmath48 and @xmath38 . this angular correlation function is@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50=@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 is the 2n angular separation .",
    "the exchange term is @xmath54 here we do not show the ( now implicit ) sum on isospin @xmath5 and the squared isospin coefficient @xmath55 which are defined trivially in each case .",
    "it is also important to note that an @xmath56$]=@xmath57 $ ] contribution in the above does not imply a @xmath4 two - nucleon pair , although this is expected to be the dominant configuration with these quantum numbers .",
    "this formal discussion has defined the @xmath0=0 2n components present in the projectile wave function that will be delivered to the target nucleus .",
    "as noted , the primary elastic and inelastic removal probabilities offer no direct selection on the @xmath0 of the removed nucleons .",
    "the target intercepts the 2n density @xmath37 near the projectile surface and @xmath0=0 pairs will be removed with all other @xmath58 terms ; all terms making additive contributions to the cross sections .",
    "the relative strengths of the @xmath0=0 , 1 components are therefore entirely determined by the nuclear structure . since the sums over the contributing configurations @xmath16 are coherent , both the sizes and phases of the tna are key factors .",
    "the @xmath0=0 , 1 relative strengths of each @xmath16 is determined by the @xmath59-coefficient in eq . [ newtna ] . since",
    ", most often , the ( exotic ) projectiles have spin @xmath60=0 , @xmath20 is fixed and equal to the final state spin @xmath61 .",
    "critically , the @xmath0 are coupled to the 2n total orbital angular momentum values @xmath38 .",
    "each @xmath38 contributes a cross section momentum distribution with a characteristic width@xcite . in general",
    "these widths show a robust increase with @xmath38 ( and hence @xmath20 ) , and a weaker , transition - dependent sensitivity to the contributing 2n configurations @xmath16 .",
    "most simply , ground - state to ground - state 2n removal from even - even nuclei , with @xmath20=0 and hence @xmath0=@xmath38=0 or @xmath0=@xmath38=1 , may highlight significant deviations and test structure model predictions .",
    "the differences in momentum widths for @xmath38=0 and @xmath38=1 are however relatively modest so high statistics measurements are necessary . for excited final - states",
    "the momentum distributions will be characteristic of the @xmath24 content of @xmath37 .",
    "in many cases@xcite final - states of the same @xmath61 will have a sufficiently different @xmath24 make - up to affect their residue momentum distributions .",
    "so , interpretation of observables is not trivial and the calculated cross sections are now more intimately ( and opaquely ) connected to the nuclear structure ; here the tna .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0=0 pair sensitivity of the reaction is not a generic feature and must be considered on a case - by - case basis . in the @xmath23-shell example used below , for @xmath62mg(@xmath632p ) , the @xmath0 content of @xmath37 is seen to vary markedly with the final state @xmath61 , a result of the interplay of the structure and @xmath59-couplings in eq .",
    "[ newtna ] .",
    "coincidence final - state measurements that are exclusive with respect to the residue final states are thus vital .",
    "more exclusive measurements , for example if one can observe correlations of the removed nucleons in the final states , may offer additional probes of these projectile ( entrance channel ) spin correlations .    applications of 2n knockout have , to date , concentrated on nuclei with @xmath64 , the shell - model providing the input to compute the @xmath37 . typically , the shell - model predicts appreciable strength to relatively simple 2n - hole states . for even - even @xmath23-shell",
    "nuclei the @xmath61=@xmath65 ground - states are strongly populated , with significant yields also to low - lying @xmath66 and @xmath67 states .",
    "we illustrate this situation with reference to 2p - removal from neutron - rich @xmath62 mg projectiles at 82 mev per nucleon incident energy .",
    "in other cases@xcite there can be significant changes in the nuclear structures between the projectile and residue states leading to a greater fragmentation of the tna strengths and a more complex interpretation of the cross sections .",
    "in the sudden plus eikonal approximations used , the projectile travels and grazes the target moving in the @xmath68 ( the beam ) direction .",
    "so , it is intuitive to construct the projection of @xmath69 ) onto the plane perpendicular to the beam direction by integration over the @xmath70 of the two nucleon positions @xmath71=@xmath72 .",
    "this maps out the pair position probability distribution ( including with respect to @xmath0 ) to that seen by the target nucleus .",
    "we denote these projected densities @xmath73 .",
    "as was detailed above , the spatial correlations of the two nucleons are concisely expressed as a function of their angular separation , @xmath74 .",
    "clearly the @xmath70-integrated joint probabilities @xmath75 are a convoluted form of this correlation function , each fixed @xmath76 sampling a range of @xmath74 .",
    "however , since the reaction is surface localized and the target is light ( small ) the effective @xmath70 thicknesses are small and the @xmath75 continue to make a valuable intuitive link between the 2n spatial ( and spin and orbital angular momentum ) correlations and their removal cross sections",

    "the @xmath0=0 terms are seen to be responsible for 64% of the computed inclusive cross section .      it is known@xcite that the presence of 2n configurations @xmath16 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 of opposite parity , e.g. via @xmath92 , @xmath93odd , single - particle excitations , generate surface pairing . in eq",

    "the cross - shell admixtures are seen to enhance the 2n spatial correlations and the 2n removal cross section .",
    "there are significant experimental challenges to measurements for such a neutron - rich 2n removal case .",
    "the valence neutrons of @xmath97ca are less bound than the protons and @xmath100ca will also be produced by population and neutron - decay of neutron - unbound states in @xmath101ca .",
    "the means to distinguish such direct and indirect paths , by fast - neutron detection , are however advanced .",
    "the influence of such cross - shell excitations on 2n removal should be quantified for nuclei at or near closed shells .",
    "the @xmath102o(@xmath632n ) reaction , where only the @xmath103o residue ground state is bound , would provide a valuable test case .",
    "a major thrust of experimental activity is toward increasingly exotic nuclides whose low - lying spectra are unknown and are often in the continuum .",
    "the importance of nucleon removal reactions derives from their detection efficiency ( near 100% ) and use of thick reaction targets , increasing the effective luminosity of the low intensity exotic beams .",
    "since , as presently measured , the experimental 2n cross sections are inclusive with respect to the final states of the target and the removed nucleons , they are relatively large .",
    "nevertheless , accessible observables remain constrained by low beam intensity to : ( a ) the decay @xmath104-rays of the reaction residues , that allow extraction of ( b ) final - state - exclusive residue cross sections , and ( c ) the differential of these cross sections with respect to the residue parallel momenta .",
    "the importance of the shapes and widths of these momentum distributions as a probe of @xmath38 ( and @xmath0 ) has been stressed .",
    "a barrier to sufficiently precise momentum measurements is the broadening of the residue momenta ( in charge changing reactions ) due to the unknown reaction point in the thick target .",
    "this problem can be mitigated , when needed , by the use of thin targets , but at the cost of reduced yields .",
    "the discussions here focus on the structure sensitivity of the direct 2n removal mechanism .",
    "the examples used are for two like nucleons ( @xmath5=1 ) .",
    "these theoretical sensitivities are valid for 2n , 2p or np - pair removal , independent of the energies of the fermi surfaces of the nucleon species .",
    "these direct cross sections can and have been measured rather cleanly , enabled by the relevant separation energy thresholds@xcite , when the two nucleons are initially strongly - bound in the projectile .",
    "thus 2p ( 2n ) removal from neutron - rich ( deficient ) systems are the most accessible .",
    "the removal of weakly bound nucleons ( and np pairs ) is in general more complicated .",
    "the mass @xmath6 residues can often be populated strongly by indirect paths , involving single - nucleon removal to and subsequent decay of intermediate , mass @xmath6 + 1 particle - unbound states . without an effective experimental discrimination between direct and indirect events , 2n removal reactions",
    "can not yet be applied to study correlations of e.g. weakly - bound 2n pairs in near - dripline neutron - rich nuclei@xcite .",
    "light @xmath105=@xmath106 nuclei are an exception@xcite .",
    "they permit further detailed tests of the reaction sensitivities for both @xmath5=0 and @xmath5=1 2n pairs in systems where proton - neutron pairing is significant .",
    "new high - statistics measurements for such systems , where there is far less ambiguity in the underlying nuclear structure , are possible and necessary .",
    "truncated - basis shell - model calculations have provided the structure touchstone for the prototype 2n removal studies to date , but the description of the reaction dynamics is indifferent to the structure model .",
    "the connection to alternative structure model predictions is most simply made through the computed @xmath107 .",
    "coupling of the existing eikonal reaction dynamics to alternative structure models will provide the means to study quantitatively those regions of rapidly changing structure associated with the onset of deformation@xcite , and heavier mid - shell nuclei in transitional regions . one- and two - nucleon spectroscopic amplitudes using bcs wave functions , written@xcite in terms of the occupation amplitudes , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,",
    "have been widely used in transfer reaction studies@xcite .",
    "these amplitudes are eminently applicable and necessary for future studies of heavier nuclei .",
    "as was also discussed , 2n removal observables will be sensitive to the mixing of opposite parity orbitals in the 2n overlap function .",
    "the degree of mixing will depend strongly on the chosen set of single - particle energies , perhaps influenced by deformation of the projectile , and by the strength of the pairing interaction .",
    "quantification of these sensitivities offers exciting future prospects and challenges to theory and experiment .",
    "we have illustrated the 2n removal reaction mechanism for lighter nuclei where prototype data sets are available for beams with modest intensity .",
    "the available data remain limited in scope and in statistical precision .",
    "an important development in these lighter systems will be to also detect the removed nucleons in the final - state and , if possible , to quantify the degree to which they are correlated .",
    "the possibility to connect any such final - state 2n correlations to those delivered by the projectile in the entrance channel , as were discussed here , will be of considerable interest .",
    "studies in heavier projectiles will bring practical complications .",
    "a first study of the @xmath110pb(@xmath632p ) reaction@xcite , with many available valence protons and a significantly higher residue level density , predict significant populations of 52 final states below the @xmath111hg separation energy .",
    "such final - state complexity presents major challenges .",
    "we have discussed the 2n correlations in a projectile wave function that can be probed , in principle , using the fast , direct 2n removal reaction mechanism .",
    "we have shown that the geometric selectivity of the reaction on light target nuclei favours configurations , and coherent sums thereof , that result in a high degree of spatial localization of pairs of nucleons near the projectile surface .",
    "access to specific information on the spin components of the wave function is possible due to their @xmath24-coupling and the dependence of the widths of residue momentum distributions to these @xmath38 components .",
    "high - statistics measurements of partial cross sections to the residue final states , of their momentum distributions , and of more exclusive observables will be needed to fully and quantitatively test these sensitivities .",

    "<S> two - nucleon removal ( or knock - out ) reactions at intermediate energies are a developing tool for both nuclear spectroscopy and for the study of certain nucleon correlations in very exotic and some stable nuclei . we present an overview of these reactions with specific emphasis on the nature of the two - nucleon correlations that can be probed . </S>",
    "<S> we outline future possibilities and tests needed to fully establish these sensitivities . </S>"
