    "a stochastic dynamical system is a dynamical system under the effects of noise .",
    "such effects of fluctuations have been of interest for over a century since the celebrated work of _ einstein _ @xcite .",
    "fluctuations are classically referred to as `` noisy '' or `` stochastic '' when their suspected origin implicates the action of a very large number of variables or degrees of freedom . for a linear system",
    "this leads to the phenomenon of diffusion , while the coupling of noise to nonlinear deterministic equations can lead to non - trivial effects @xcite .",
    "for example , noise can stabilize unstable equilibria and shift bifurcations , _",
    "i.e. _ the parameter value at which the dynamics changes qualitatively @xcite .",
    "noise can also lead to transitions between coexisting deterministic stable states or attractors such as in birhythmic or bistable system @xcite .",
    "moreover , noise can induce new stable states that have no deterministic counterpart , for instance noise excites internal modes of oscillation , and it can even enhance the response of a nonlinear system to external signals @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate analytically the effects of an additive noise on a special bistable system that displays birhythmicity  coexisting attractors that are characterized by different frequencies @xcite .",
    "we examine a birhythmic self - sustained system described by the modified _ van - der pol _",
    "oscillator , subjected to an additive gaussian white noise @xcite .",
    "our main aim is to use the phase - amplitude approximation @xcite , a standard technique for van der pol @xcite and van der pol - like systems @xcite , to derive an effective _ fokker - planck _",
    "equation @xcite that can be analytically managed .",
    "this allows us to analytically derive the activation energies associated to the switching between different attractors @xcite .",
    "the analytical solution of the approximated model is not limited to vanishingly small noise intensity as it was done for the numerical estimate of the escape time @xcite to derive the pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "another purpose of the present paper is to verify , with numerical simulations , that in spite of the approximations the analytical probability distribution is reliable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the modified _ van - der pol _ system with an additive gaussian white noise . section iii deals with the derivation and analysis of an effective _ fokker - planck _",
    "equation for the birhythmic modified _ van der pol _ oscillator . the probability distribution given by the approximated _ fokker - planck _ equation",
    "is analyzed and the activation energies are derived . in section iv , we integrate numerically the stochastic second order differential equation and discuss the results .",
    "section v concludes .",
    "the model considered is a _ van der pol _ oscillator with a nonlinear dissipation of higher polynomial order described by the equation ( overdots as usual stand for the derivative with respect to time ) @xmath0 this model was proposed by kaiser @xcite as more appropriate than the _ van der pol _ oscillator to describe certain specific processes in biophysical systems .",
    "in fact the modified _",
    "van der pol_-like oscillator described by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is used to model coherent oscillations in biological systems , such as an enzymatic substrate reaction with ferroelectric behavior in brain waves models ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . from the standpoint of nonlinear dynamics , it represents a model which exhibits an extremely rich bifurcation behavior .",
    "the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive parameters which measure the degree of tendency of the system to a ferroelectric instability compared to its electric resistance , while @xmath3 is the parameter that tunes nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the model eq.([eq1 ] ) is a nonlinear self - sustained oscillator which possesses more than one stable limit - cycle solution @xcite .",
    "such systems are of interest especially in biology , for example to describe the coexistence of two stable oscillatory states , as in enzyme reactions @xcite .",
    "another example is the explanation of the existence of multiple frequency and intensity windows in the reaction of biological systems when they are irradiated with very weak electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , the model under consideration offers general aspects concerning the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "_ kaiser _ and _ eichwald _ @xcite have analyzed the super - harmonic resonance structure , while _ eichwald _ and _ kaiser _ @xcite have found symmetry - breaking crisis and intermittency .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an analytical approximation has been derived for the coexisting oscillations of the two attractors with different natural frequencies for the deterministic part of the model equation . a numerical investigation of the escape times ( and hence of the activation energies )",
    "has suggested that the stability properties of the attractors can be very different @xcite .",
    "it has further been shown that time delayed feedback leads to stabilization @xcite , also in the presence of external noise @xcite .",
    "noise can enter the system for instance , through the electric field applied to the excited enzymes which depends on the external chemical influences or through the flow of enzyme molecules .",
    "one can therefore assume that the environmental influence contains a random perturbation and to postulate that the activated enzymes are subject to a random excitation governed by the _ langevin _",
    "version of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , namely : @xmath4 @xmath5 can be assumed to be an additive gaussian white noise with arbitrary amplitude @xmath6 @xcite and it has the properties : @xmath7    which completely determine its statistical features .",
    "the noise term is here treated as external @xcite , i.e. due to a disturbance from the environment and not subject to the fluctuation dissipation theorem .      without noise",
    "( @xmath8 ) , eq.([eq2 ] ) reduces to the modified version of the _ van der pol _ oscillator ( [ eq1 ] ) which has steady - state solutions that depend on the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath3 and correspond to attractors in state space .",
    "the dynamical attractors of the free - noise modified _ van der pol _ eq.([eq1 ] ) have been determined analytically , the expressions of the amplitudes @xmath10 and frequency @xmath11 ( i=1,2,3 ) of the limit - cycle solutions have been established in ref.@xcite , in which the periodic solutions of the modified _ van der pol _ oscillator ( [ eq1 ] ) are approximated by @xmath12 the amplitude @xmath13 is independent of the coefficient @xmath3 up to corrections of the order @xmath14 and implicitly given by the relation : @xmath15    the coefficient @xmath3 enters in the expression for the frequency @xmath16 as a second order correction : @xmath17    thus the deviations of the frequency from the linear harmonic solution are characterized by an amplitude dependent frequency @xcite : @xmath18    depending on the values of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the modified _ van der pol _",
    "oscillator possesses one or three limit cycles .",
    "in fact , eq.([eq7 ] ) can give rise to one or three positive real roots that correspond to one stable limit cycle or three limit cycle solutions ( of which two are stable and one is unstable ) , respectively .",
    "the dynamical attractors and birhythmicity ( _ i.e. _ the coexistence between two stable regimes of limit cycle oscillations ) are numerically found solving the amplitude eq.([eq : amplitude ] ) @xcite .",
    "the three roots @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denote the inner stable orbit , the unstable orbit , and the outer stable orbit , respectively .",
    "when three limit cycles are obtained , eq.([eq8 ] ) supplies the frequencies @xmath22 in correspondence of the roots @xmath23 .",
    "being one of the attractors unstable , the system only displays two frequencies @xmath24 ( and hence birhythmicity ) at two different amplitudes @xmath25 , while the unstable limit cycle of amplitude @xmath20 represents the separatrix between the basins of attraction of the stable limit cycles .",
    "we show in fig.1 the region of existence of birhythmicity in the two parameters phase space ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) @xcite ( the two coexisting stable limit cycle attractors can be found in @xcite ) . the question we want to address is the influence of noise on the above properties investigating the response of an additive gaussian white noise in the phase - amplitude limit . in ref.@xcite",
    "the system has been numerically tackled in the regime of vanishingly small noise . in this limit",
    "the escape rate gives an effective potential that acts as an activation barrier .",
    "we employ the phase - amplitude approximation that should be both faster ( being analytical ) and more accurate at finite values of the noise , as will be discussed in the next sect . @xmath26 .",
    "the analytic results on the deterministic system are based on the approximated cycle given by eq.([eq6 ] ) .",
    "quite naturally , one can treat the noise in the system starting from such approximation . to this extent ,",
    "we rewrite the _ langevin _ eq.([eq2 ] ) in a system of two coupled first order differential equations : @xmath27    we seek for solution in the context of the phase - amplitude approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ letting the amplitude and the phase of eq.([eq6 ] ) to be time dependent @xcite : @xmath28    inserting eq.([eq10 ] ) into eq.([eq9 ] ) , one retrieves a system of two _ langevin _",
    "equations for the amplitude @xmath29 and phase @xmath30 variables , that is , of course , as difficult to manage as the original model ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "we will follow the standard analysis of nonlinear oscillators @xcite that consists in assuming that in a period @xmath31 the variables @xmath29 and @xmath32 do not change significantly , so one can average the effect of the random perturbation @xcite .",
    "although in principle this method also relies on the smallness of the noise , since the averaging requires that the approximate solution ( [ eq10 ] ) is not significantly altered in a cycle @xmath31 , the procedure has proven very robust in a similar _ van der pol - duffing _",
    "oscillator @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that for @xmath33 the system reduces to the harmonic oscillator , as described by the solution eq.([eq10 ] ) with constant amplitude and phase .",
    "since we are interested in the influence of noise @xmath6 and nonlinear dissipation ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in birhythmic systems , we keep the parameter @xmath3 small ( @xmath34 ) . if the present model is employed to model the population of enzyme molecules , the parameter represents the difference between the thermal activated polarization and the external field induced polarization @xcite . however , we note that for a birhythmic system a further difficulty occurs : the system has two different frequencies @xmath35 , while the approximation ( [ eq10 ] ) is monorhythmical .",
    "assuming that the two frequencies are not too different , we insert eq.([eq10 ] ) into eq.([eq9 ] ) and average , to retrieve the effective ( and simpler ) _ langevin _ equation for the amplitude @xmath13 and phase @xmath36 variables : @xmath37-\\sqrt{\\frac{d}{2\\omega_0 ^ 2}}<\\gamma(t)>.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we thus study the system in the slow averaged variables ; for the slow variables the average noise can still be considered white and uncorrelated @xcite , and the _ fokker - planck _ equation associated to the _ langevin _ model ( [ eq11 ] ) reads : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the probability current defined by : @xmath40    the drift coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 associated to eq.([eq11 ] ) read : @xmath43+\\frac{d}{2\\omega^2a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the off diagonal diffusion coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 vanish , while the diagonal coefficient read : @xmath46    we seek for stationary solutions , @xmath47 of eq.([eq12 ] ) .",
    "we note that in the averaged equation ( [ eq10 ] ) for the phase @xmath13 the phase @xmath36 does not appear , and therefore the integration over all phases gives rises to a normalization constant .",
    "we therefore only seek solutions for the probability distribution associated to the constant probability current , @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , since the probability distribution must vanish for @xmath49 , we can set the constant to @xmath50 .",
    "finally , the equation for the radial part of the probability distribution @xmath51 reads : @xmath52    or , explicitly : @xmath53 \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is a constant of normalization .",
    "this solution contains as particular cases the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and discarding the @xmath57 term ) and the standard _ van der pol",
    "_ oscillator ( @xmath58 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "the probability distribution is in general very asymmetric , for most of the parameters @xmath1 or @xmath2 one can localize the probability function around a single orbit . before proceeding further in our analysis , it should be noted that the peaks of the probability distribution can be located using the following equation : @xmath59 a^2-\\frac{d}{\\mu \\omega^2}=0.\\ ] ]    for @xmath60 , the amplitude ( [ eq18 ] ) coincides with the deterministic amplitude equation ( 5)@xcite . in fig.2 we report the influence of the noise intensity @xmath6 on the region of multi - limit cycle orbits of fig .",
    "1 . in the parametric @xmath61-plane of fig .",
    "2 it is evident the effect of the noise intensity @xmath6 on the transition boundary between the appearance of single and multi - limit cycles orbits : the bifurcation that leads to birhythmicity is postponed under the influence of noise @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the region of existence of three limit cycles , a condition for birhythmicity , decreases with the increase of the noise intensity and disappears altogether for high noise intensity .",
    "an important feature of birhythmicity in the present model is highlighted in fig .",
    "we first define @xmath62 of the probability to find the system in the basin of attraction of each stable orbit @xmath63 and @xmath64 : @xmath65    these quantities measure the relative stabilities pertaining to the attractors @xmath63 and @xmath64 and are related to the resident time by the relation @xmath66 , so that @xmath67 . in fig.[fig2a ] we show in the parameter plane @xmath68 the locus where the system stays with equal probability on both attractors ( solid line ) @xmath69 .",
    "we also show two further curves : the limit where the first attractor is much more stable than the other ( @xmath70 , circles ) and the passage to the reverse situation ( @xmath71 , crosses ) . from the figure it is evident that the outer attractor is dominantly visited in most of the parameter plane .",
    "moreover , the transition from the two opposite cases ( _ i.e. _ , a change of two order of magnitudes of the relative resident times ) occurs with a very narrow change of the control parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the drastic change is further investigated in fig .",
    "4 , where we show a blow - up of the crossover region around @xmath69 for different values of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1 value is increased up to the maximum value when birhythmicity disappears .",
    "the general behavior observed for all @xmath2 values , closely reminds phase transitions : the probability to find the system in one condition ( around the attractor @xmath19 ) or the other ( around the attractor @xmath21 ) drastically changes in a very small interval of the @xmath1 parameter . the same behavior , this time with a constant value of @xmath1 and varying @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "the effect of the noise intensity is much less pronounced , see fig .",
    "it is apparent that the effective temperature is capable to cause a crossover between the residence times only in a very narrow region of the phase space , inasmuch as the noise causes a contraction of the region of existence of birhythmicity .",
    "however it is evident that the transition is much slower , and a crossover only occurs in the limited parameter space around @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the stability properties of the two attractors have also been investigated in the limit of small noise values @xcite , where it has been found the same asymmetrical behavior of the probability distribution , with a sudden change for small variations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in fact one can notice that the effective _ langevin _ equation ( [ eq11 ] ) amounts to the brownian motion of a particle in a double well , whose potential reads @xcite : @xmath74.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is therefore evident that the transition from the inner orbit @xmath19 to the outer orbit @xmath21 through the unstable orbit @xmath20 , as well as the inverse process , can be interpreted as the diffusion over an effective potential barrier , and therefore the escape times are given by the _ kramer s _ inverse rate @xcite , for instance used in josephson physics to detect the classical quantum / classical crossover @xcite or for signal detection @xcite .",
    "@xmath75= \\exp \\left[\\frac{\\delta u_1}{d } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\tau_{3\\rightarrow 1 } & \\propto & \\exp \\left[\\frac{4\\omega^2}{d}\\left ( f_a(a_2)-f_a(a_3 ) \\right ) \\right]=   \\exp \\left[\\frac{\\delta u_3}{d } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the average time to pass from one attractor to the other is analogous to the passage over a barrier .",
    "the pseudopotential barrier numerically derived in ref.@xcite is therefore , in the phase - amplitude approximation , an effective potential for the amplitude variables @xcite .",
    "since the effective potential is analytical , we can confirm several features of the pseudo - potential , for instance that the potential barriers are proportional to the nonlinear parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the behavior of the potential barriers of eq.([eq20 ] ) as a function of the parameters @xmath1 an @xmath2 , the analogous of the analysis of eq.([eq17 ] ) in figs .",
    "inspection of the effective potential ( [ eq20 ] ) , confirms that it is very asymmetrical , since one energy barrier is generally much higher than the other . combining this observation with the exponential behavior of the escape rates ( [ eq20 ] )",
    "one deduces that the system does not equally stays on both attractors , but rather it clearly exhibits a preference for one attractor with respect to the other ( the relative occupancies read @xmath76 $ ] @xcite ) .",
    "one concludes that the birhythmic system behaves as a bistable tunnel diode @xcite : keeping fixed a control parameter ( say @xmath2 ) and changing the other ( @xmath1 in this case ) the weight of the probability distribution is concentrated in the proximity of one or the other of the two stable deterministic solutions of eq.([eq1 ] ) , thus obtaining again a first order phase transition .",
    "this result supports the notion that the analogy with phase transitions is generic for bistable oscillators @xcite .",
    "to check the validity of the approximations behind the analytic treatment that has led to the solution ( [ eq17 ] ) , we have performed numerical simulations of the langevin dynamics ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "there are several methods and algorithms for solving second - order stochastic differential equations @xcite as the implicit midpoint rule with _",
    "heun _ and _ leapfrog _ methods or faster numerical algorithms such as the stochastic version of the _ runge - kutta _ methods and a quasisymplectic algorithm @xcite . to prove that the simple procedure given by the _ euler _ algorithm is reliable , we have employed it in a few selected points with two different methods .",
    "the starting point is the _ box - mueller _",
    "algorithm @xcite to generate a gaussian white noise distributed random variable @xmath77 from two random numbers @xmath78 and @xmath79 which are uniformly distributed on the unit interval @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "the random number approximates the effect of the noise of intensity @xmath6 over the interval @xmath81 in the _ euler _ algorithm for the integration of eq.([eq9 ] ) .",
    "we have then halved the step size @xmath81 until the results became independent of the step size ; the step size used for all numerical integration is @xmath82 . to verify the numerical results obtained with the euler method ,",
    "we have used a quasi - symplectic algorithm of _ mannella _ @xcite to numerically compute the probability distribution .",
    "the logic behind the choice to compare the _ euler _ algorithm with a quasi - symplectic algorithm is that the nonlinear dissipation of the model ( [ eq2 ] ) oscillates and vanishes twice in each cycle .",
    "we have therefore checked the results with an algorithm that has proved to perform independently of the dissipation value @xcite .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot the behavior of the probability distribution @xmath51 as a function of the amplitude @xmath13 for several values of the noise intensity @xmath6 ,",
    "when the frequencies of both attractors are similar , _ i.e. _ @xmath83 .",
    "it clearly shows that the system is more likely found at two distinct distances from the origin , the essential feature of birhythmicity . in general , for the set of parameters @xmath84 , the probability distribution @xmath51 is asymmetric . as observed in sec . @xmath26 the probability distribution changes with a small variation of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the agreement between numerical and analytical results is fairly good for low @xmath13 values around the inner orbit , when the frequency of one attractor is very similar to @xmath63 , while for larger amplitude @xmath13 the agreement becomes progressively poorer .",
    "however , it seems that the phase - amplitude approximation is capable to capture the main feature of the phenomenon : an increase or a decrease of the amplitude when the fluctuation parameter @xmath6 is varied . at high fluctuations ( @xmath85 )",
    "the system becomes monorhythmical , see also fig .",
    "2 , thus confirming the noise induced transition from bimodal to unimodal , sometimes referred to as phenomenological bifurcations @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "@xmath26 , the phase - amplitude approximation is not appropriate when the two frequencies of the attractors are different , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath86 . in fact",
    "numerical simulations in this case show a poor agreement , see fig .",
    "8 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this shows the limitations of this analysis of phase - amplitude approximation .",
    "let us return to eq.([eq18 ] ) that shows how the orbits radii depend on the noise intensity @xmath6 .",
    "the analytical and numerical behaviors of the limit cycle attractors are reported in figs . 9 and 10 that show amplitudes @xmath25 and the associated bandwidths @xmath89 ( the width when the height of the probability peaks is reduced of a factor @xmath90 ) as a function of the noise intensity @xmath6 for two sets of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath21 change very slightly when the noise intensity increases .",
    "also the bandwidth slightly increases with the noise intensity @xmath6 . through eqs .",
