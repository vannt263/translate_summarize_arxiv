    "photometry from radio to infrared wavelengths has shown that double - lobed radio - loud quasars show deep minima in their spectral energy distributions at millimeter wavelengths ( antonucci et al .",
    "1990 ) , which indicates that the radio emission arises from components which can not be related to the infrared emission .",
    "however , the nature of the far - infrared emission observed in double - lobed radio sources remains unclear . most evidence ( haas et al .",
    "1998 , polletta et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) points at a thermal nature of the infrared emission , although a possible contribution from relativistically beamed , non - thermal emission has not yet been carefully determined .",
    "relativistic beaming can play an important role in the infrared emission of quasars , in which the relativistic jet is oriented closer to the line of sight ( barthel 1989 ) . in radio - galaxies",
    "however , beaming is thought to have a negligible effect ( hoekstra et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the significance of beaming may be estimated by extrapolating the radio core spectra to infrared wavelengths . the non - thermal emission from the radio lobes",
    "can be safely neglected , as these have no bulk relativistic motions and thus show no beaming .",
    "however , the exact shape of the core spectrum is unknown at high frequencies .    in order to improve the quality of the extrapolation of the non - thermal spectrum",
    ", we measured 1.2 mm continuum fluxes for eight 3cr objects , of which seven have been observed with isophot on board iso ( lemke et al .",
    "1996 ; kessler et al . 1996 ) and with the nrao very large array ( vla ) ( van bemmel et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we here compare the 1.2 mm fluxes with the integrated radio and infrared data , and for the quasars in the sample , with their radio core spectra .",
    "the general properties of our objects are listed in table  1 .",
    "the sample consists of three radio - loud quasars ( qsr ) , two broad - line radio galaxies ( blrg ) , one narrow - line radio galaxy ( nlrg ) and the radio structure 3c59 .",
    "the latter was previously misidentified with the seyfert1 galaxy rbs0281 .",
    "the maps of meurs & unger ( 1991 ) show three components : a north - western source ( the original 3c59 ) , a central source associated with rbs0281 , and a south - eastern source .",
    "3c59 has no optical counterpart , so it is either a lobe of rbs0281 , or a background core - dominated quasar .",
    "with isophot only rbs0281 was observed .",

    "this value is an average of observed values in nearby active and normal galaxies . to be conservative , we adopted dust temperatures of 20k , which is even colder than the coldest dust found in active galaxies with iso ( e.g. siebenmorgen et al . 1999 ) .",

    "3c59 is excluded , because its redshift has not yet been determined .",
    "although we find that the infrared luminosities are comparable between the classes , there is evidence that the quasars are brighter at 1.2 mm than the radio galaxies . at 178mhz the quasars are only marginally brighter .",
    "the sample is too small to draw firm conclusions , but it appears that the stronger millimeter emission from quasars may be due to a beamed component .",
    "when comparing the integrated flux at 178mhz and 1.4ghz , the quasars are a factor 1.5 brighter than the radio galaxies . in case of isotropic synchrotron emission over the whole radio spectrum , this factor should be constant .",
    "however , it appears to increase toward higher frequencies ; at 250ghz the quasars are about three times brighter than the radio galaxies .",
    "this indicates that we observe an additional component , which is unlikely to be due to dust emission , since that would be optically thin and therefore also visible in the radio galaxies . for synchrotron emission , the excess can only be beamed emission , which causes a natural anisotropy",
    ". it would be desirable to confirm this trend with a larger sample .",
    "there is clear evidence of spectral steepening of the radio spectrum towards millimeter wavelengths . the average spectral index for the entire sample ranges from @xmath31 at the lowest frequency to @xmath32 at millimeter wavelengths ( table  4 ) .",
    "spectral steepening occurs in most objects in our sample , irrespective of their size or the resolution of the observations .",
    "we find that the 1.2 mm flux densities are well below those expected from an extrapolation of the total radio flux densities .",
    "if cold dust gives rise to the millimeter emission , then the millimeter flux densities are expected to lie above the extrapolated radio spectra , and the grey - body extrapolation should fit the observed flux . in our data",
    "the opposite is true , and therefore the millimeter emission is probably dominated by synchrotron emission , except maybe for 3c460 , where this case is not so clear .    since the far - infrared fluxes are more than an order of magnitude higher than the millimeter fluxes , the far - infrared emission is likely to arise from dust .",
    "the clear minimum of the sed at millimeter wavelengths excludes that the far - infrared emission is the continuation of the radio synchrotron spectrum of the radio lobes or the core .",
    "if the far - infrared emission were due to synchrotron radiation , it would have to arise from a very young electron population .",
    "the younger the electrons , the closer they must be to the core , so that their emission would be even more strongly beamed than synchrotron emission at millimeter wavelengths . as a consequence , the quasars should be brighter than radio galaxies at infrared wavelengths , for which there is no evidence in our data .",
    "instead we find that in the infrared the quasars and radio galaxies are comparably bright , while at 1.2 mm the quasars are clearly brighter than the radio galaxies .",
    "the possible contribution of relativistically beamed synchrotron emission to the far - infrared emission is estimated by extrapolating the radio sed .",
    "this yields on average a less than 10% contribution in quasars , and a less than 1% contribution in radio galaxies .",
    "although in 3c323.1 the core radio spectrum would extrapolate well to the observed far - infrared fluxes , the 1.2 mm emission falls below this extrapolation , indicating a turnover in the core spectrum , which excludes a significant contribution of non - thermal emission to the far - infrared .",
    "an earlier study of the infrared emission from radio - loud active galaxies indicated that quasars are significantly brighter at 60@xmath4 m than radio galaxies ( heckman et al .",
    "this does not contradict what we find from our sample .",
    "the objects in the heckman sample have an average redshift @xmath33@xmath34 , thus in their rest frame the emission emerges at @xmath33@xmath35 m .",
    "if the infrared emission arises from a circumnuclear torus , the dust is likely to be optically thick up to @xmath36@xmath4 m ( pier & krolik 1992 , granato & danese 1994 ) , and the emerging flux depends on the orientation of the torus . according to these models , the observed flux could vary by orders of magnitude , depending on the torus optical depth . however , isophot studies ( bbg ) show no conclusive evidence that quasars are intrinsically brighter in the far - infrared than radio galaxies , when they are matched in radio power and redshift .      unified models for radio - loud agn ( urry & padovani 1995 , barthel 1989 ) suggest that quasars are oriented with their jets closer to the line of sight than radio galaxies .",
    "this implies that any beamed component is more evident in quasars , but also that isotropic emission , such as optically thin dust emission , should not differ among the types .",
    "our observations confirm this picture , showing that quasars are more luminous at millimeter wavelengths , where we expect relativistic beaming , whereas they do not differ in their far - infrared luminosity , which is due to isotropic cold dust emission , and therefore unaffected by beaming .",
    "the luminosity ratio qsr / rg increases with frequency , which can only naturally be explained by beaming .",
    "if this trend is confirmed in larger samples , millimeter observations in combination with radio observations could provide a direct measure of the orientation of a source .",
    "e.g. for a quasar and a radio galaxy of comparable 178mhz power , the radio galaxy provides the unbeamed radio sed that can be subtracted from the quasar sed .",
    "the remaining emission is then due to beaming , and the strength of this beamed component depends directly on the viewing angle of the source .      for three of our objects ,",
    "the radio structures are larger than the beam size of the iram  30 m telescope , so that the hotspots fall outside the central bolometer channel .",
    "we made no attempt to observe the hotspots separately .",
    "the radio fluxes for all objects are integrated fluxes , including the lobe emission .",
    "the mambo fluxes are also integrated fluxes for the small objects , but core fluxes for the objects with larger radio sizes than the iram beam . if the millimeter emission would be dominated by the lobe emission in all objects , there should be a clear turnover in the seds of the large objects , where the lobes are not observed with mambo .",
    "on the other hand , if the core dominates the millimeter emission in all objects , the seds should be comparable , irrespective of object radio size .",
    "we observe no clear difference between the radio ",
    "millimeter sed of large and small objects , which seems to indicate that the core is dominating the millimeter emission .",
    "this does not imply that the lobes do not emit any millimeter emission , e.g. in cygnus  a the hotspots have been clearly detected with scuba at 850@xmath4 m ( robson et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "however , there might be a relation between the luminosity density of the lobes at 1.2 mm and the size of the radio structure .",
    "small radio sources are known to have much flatter spectra ( murgia et al .",
    "1999 ) and thus can have much stronger lobes . in our mambo observations ,",
    "all small sources are unresolved and thus we can not tell which component is dominating .",
    "if the lobes dominate in small objects and the core dominates in larger ones , the expected difference in spectral indices will not be visible .",
    "we always observe the dominating regions , i.e. the lobes in the small radio sources and only the core in the larger ones .",
    "judging from the radio core fluxes in 3c277.1 , the core is not the dominant 1.2 mm source here .",
    "the same can be true for 3c67 and 3c460 , which are also small radio sources .",
    "the lobe emission will dilute the amount of beaming observed in small objects , thus for a proper estimate of the amount of beaming the objects should have comparable radio sizes and be larger than the iram30 m telescope beam .",
    "we find evidence for variability in 3c334 .",
    "since we have only one observation for each object , variability can not be ruled out for the other objects .",
    "previous scuba observations of the other quasars ( bbg ) are consistent with the mambo detections , confirming the spectral steepening and the thermal nature of the infrared emission . for the radio galaxies",
    "there is remarkably little dispersion in the observed spectral slopes .",
    "thus , variability must be small in all other objects .",
    "the main conclusions , drawn from our continuum observations at 1.2 mm of eight radio - loud active galaxies , can be summarized as follows .    * the millimeter emission is dominated by non - thermal processes , whereas the far - infrared emission must be thermal . *",
    "any thermal contribution to the millimeter emission arising from cold dust is estimated to be less than 15% , except for 3c460 , where the case is not clear . *",
    "an extrapolation of the non - thermal radio spectrum to far - infrared wavelengths shows that the contribution of non - thermal emission at 160@xmath4 m is less than 10% .",
    "* there is evidence that at 1.2 mm the quasar emission is stronger , and therefore possibly more beamed , than that from radio galaxies .",
    "* the far - infrared luminosity on the other hand , does not differ between quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "most likely because it arises from optically thin thermal emission , but optical thickness effects can play a role up to 100@xmath4 m in the rest frame of the objects . *",
    "radio and millimeter observations provide an interesting test for unification models of radio - loud active galaxies , in that they can provide a measure of the amount of beamed emission .",
