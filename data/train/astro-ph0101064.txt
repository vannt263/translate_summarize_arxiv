    "we have during the last several years been undertaking programmes aimed at detecting optical counterparts of the most rich class of qso absorption line systems , the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers or dlas for short ( mller and warren 1993 , 1998 ; fynbo et al .",
    "1999 , 2000a , b ) .",
    "dlas cause ly@xmath0 absorption lines with damping wings corresponding to column densities larger than @xmath6 .",
    "this very large column density absorption occurs in regions of self shielding , cool gas , i.e. where one would expect stars to form .",
    "furthermore , they contain nearly all the neutral gas in the universe ( wolfe et al .",
    "hence dlas at high redshift are prime candidates for being the progenitors of present day galaxies .    at redshifts @xmath7 dlas are both rarer and observationally more difficult to detect since ly@xmath0 is not shifted above atmospheric cut  off and hence can not be observed with ground based telescopes ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; jannuzi et al .",
    "1998 ; rao & turnshek 2000 ) .",
    "le brun et al . (",
    "1997 ) reported candidate galaxy counterparts of 7 such low redshift absorbers that are either confirmed dlas or strong mgii / feii absorbers .",
    "they found that those candidate galaxy counterparts cover a wide range in morphological types .    the z@xmath1 = 0.457 bal qso ( 2000.0 coordinates ra 21 14 52.6 , dec + 06 07 41 ) is radio quiet , and has optical magnitudes b = 15.52 and v = 15.77 .",
    "lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported the detection of a candidate dla at z@xmath2 = 0.2039 in the iue spectrum of q2112 + 059 . in september 1996",
    "we performed an imaging study of q2112 + 059 in an attempt to detect the optical counterpart of this dla .",
    "the imaging and data reduction is described in sect .",
    "2 , in sect .",
    "3 we present spectroscopic data from the hubble data archive and in sect .",
    "4 and 5 we discuss our results .    for easy comparison to earlier work on this subject",
    ", we shall here assume a hubble constant of 50 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath9=1.0 .",
    "the observations were performed in 1996 with hirac ( high resolution adaptive camera ) on the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope under photometric and excellent seeing conditions .",
    "the ccd used was a 1k@xmath101k back - side illuminated thinned tektronix with a pixel scale of 0.176 arcsec .",
    "the data were all obtained in the bessel i filter .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table  [ journal ] .",
    "a total integration time of 3.25 hours was obtained .",
    "also observed were 7 landolt sequences ( landolt 1992 ) .",

    "based on an iue spectrum of q2112 + 059 lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported a candidate damped ly@xmath0 line at z=0.2039 .",
    "subsequent hst spectroscopy ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) has not confirmed this .",
    "this result is important in its own right as dlas are very rare at @xmath11 . in the sample of dlas presented in wolfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) there are 10 dlas at z@xmath121.0 . of the 10 only 4 are at z@xmath120.5 , and one of those was the candidate dla towards q2112 + 059 .",
    "having ruled out the presence of an intervening dla at z = 0.2039 , we find that we are forced to interpret the elliptical galaxy we detect under the psf of q2112 + 059 as the host galaxy of the qso .",
    "the host galaxy has an i - band magnitude of 18.8 ( total magnitude determined from the model fit ) , and an effective radius of 3.6 kpc .",
    "i=18.8 corresponds to m@xmath3 ( no k - correction ) in the assumed cosmology ( sect .",
    "1 ) .    mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that both radio galaxies ( rgs ) , radio loud qsos ( rlqs ) and bright radio quiet qsos ( rqqs ) preferentially are hosted by massive , bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "our detection of a bright elliptical galaxy hosting the radio quiet q2112 + 059 is consistent with this result . in table",
    "[ profileparams ] we compare our results to those of mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and find that the host galaxy of q2112 + 059 is in the bright end of the absolute magnitude distribution , but has a smaller effective radius than any rqq host galaxy in their sample .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 1983 ) studied the brightest cluster galaxies in 83 abell clusters ( with redshifts in the same range as the mclure et al .",
    "samples ) .",
    "they found a tight correlation between the core radii and effective radii .",
    "the host galaxy of q2112 + 059 falls nicely on this correlation , but is smaller than any of the brightest cluster galaxies of the schneider et al",
    ". sample .    compared to the work on local early type galaxies by kormendy ( 1977 ) ,",
    "the effective radius of the host galaxy of q2112 + 059 falls in the overlapping region between `` compact '' and `` normal '' early type galaxies .    finally , since the host galaxy we have detected is a spheroid we can estimate the mass of the black hole using the correlations derived by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) assuming that the correlation found at z=0 is also valid at z=0.457 .",
    "we derive a black hole mass of about 9@xmath1010@xmath13 m@xmath14 .",

    "<S> in a ongoing programme aimed at studying galaxy counterparts of damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) we have obtained high resolution deep i - band imaging data of the field around the z@xmath1 = 0.457 bal qso q2112 + 059 . in the literature this qso is listed to have a candidate dla at z@xmath2 = 0.2039 along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> after subtraction of the qso point spread function ( psf ) we detect a galaxy centred on the position of q2112 + 059 . to help answer whether this galaxy is the dla or the qso host galaxy we retrieved a ghrs spectrum of q2112 + 059 from the hst - archive . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum shows that there is no ly@xmath0 absorption line at z@xmath2 = 0.2039 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact in combination with the perfect alignment on the sky of the galaxy and q2112 + 059 lead us to the conclusion that the galaxy must be the host galaxy of q2112 + 059 .    </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxy of q2112 + 059 is bright ( m@xmath3 ) , and has a radial profile well fitted by a _ modified hubble + de vaucouleurs _ profile with @xmath4kpc and @xmath5kpc . </S>",
    "<S> our results are well in line with the conclusion of earlier work done at lower redshifts , that bright low redshift qsos preferentially reside in luminous , elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the host of q2112 + 059 is however , despite it s brightness , very compact when compared to early type galaxies at lower redshifts . </S>"
