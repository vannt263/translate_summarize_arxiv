    "in nowadays condensed matter physics , common fascinating collective behaviors and novel quantum phases are reported in various domains of physics , more specifically in bosonic systems encountered in quantum magnetism , ultracold atoms on optical lattices and strongly correlated materials .",
    "thanks to their versatility , an important amount of exotic phases has been reported in the literature these last years , both experimental and theoretical , such as different types of superfluids @xcite , insulators @xcite , bose metals @xcite or supersolid phases @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the system enters a phase combining crystalline order and superfluidity , and typically arising from the quantum melting of a mott insulator ; this phenomenon is at the origin of intense scientific activities and debates ; experimentally , indications for supersolidity were supposed to be found in @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "however , necessary conditions for continuous symmetry breaking questioned this interpretation @xcite and recent experiments have clearly ruled out this scenario @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , supersolids are easier achieved on lattice systems ; whereas on a square geometry with nearest neighbor interactions a soft - core description is required @xcite , they can also be found in hard - core bosonic models when frustration is induced by either further neighbor interactions @xcite and/or lattice geometry , _",
    "e.g. _ triangular @xcite .",
    "an other interesting direction to stabilize supersolidity is to increase the number of degrees of freedom in frustrated systems . in that respect ,",
    "bosonic mixtures with several species of bosons , usually encountered in optical lattices @xcite , either heteronuclear @xcite or homonuclear @xcite , as well as bilayer systems with interactions but no hopping between layers @xcite are very promising .",
    "such systems allow for an even broader variety of quantum phases than their single - species counterparts , depending on the intra- and inter - species interactions , and on the dimension and lattice connectivity .",
    "theoretically , compared to an already rich literature on mixtures in 1d @xcite only few works have focused on 2d cases for instance on square @xcite and triangular @xcite lattices . in all those systems , when contact and dipolar interactions @xcite are taken independently , interaction - induced insulators , _",
    "e.g. _ density - homogeneous or density wave @xcite are favored .",
    "hence , their competition can , along with quantum fluctuations , trigger various unconventional phases @xcite , especially in systems with kinetic or interaction frustration .     triangular lattice hosting bosons of two species labelled @xmath1 ( blue ) and @xmath2 ( brown ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    in this paper , we provide a theoretical study of a two - species bosonic mixture on a triangular lattice as depicted in fig .  [ mopha ] .",
    "we aim to focus on the most simple model with competing interactions in frustrated geometry in order to study possible mechanisms for stabilizing exotic phases .",
    "the richness of the phase diagram of a related one - species model with hard core constraint @xcite allows us to expect even more exotic physics for a mixture of two mutually interacting species .",
    "even though such interactions can be encountered in cold atom systems @xcite with polarized dipoles @xcite , the present work describes the maximally frustrating cases for which all interactions are repulsive .",
    "we address the following issues : ( i ) how on - site and nearest neighbor interactions compete and ( ii ) how lattice frustration impacts on the stabilization of non - conventional phases of such a mixture . to achieve these goals ,",
    "we use mainly a _ cluster mean field _ theory ( cmft ) and",
    "exact diagonalizations ( ed ) on periodic clusters ; both methods are detailed , along with the model we consider , in section [ mm ] . note that preliminary quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations have been performed to support our findings ( see text ) .",
    "we present in section [ pd ] an overview of the phase diagram obtained this way , before focusing on the most interesting phases .",
    "first , we describe in section [ cs ] some commensurate spin - like phases .",
    "these are characterized with means of perturbative approaches ; they have frozen densities and , for one of them , spin - like supersolidity .",
    "next , we analyze in section [ is ] incommensurate phases found in this study : these include two original two - species supersolid ( ss ) phases , which belong to our main findings . eventually we address in section [ pt ] the nature of phase transitions involving these peculiar phases , before some concluding remarks in section [ cc ] .",

    "we focus on the limit of hard core bosons ( @xmath15 ) with an implicit onsite intra - species repulsion @xmath16 .",
    "together with the repulsive interspecies coupling @xmath5 , this allows us to maximize the effects of frustration .",
    "we have studied the more general case in function of independent @xmath17 and @xmath18 and found that the richest physics was found in the symmetric case @xmath19 , including the novel supersolid regimes .",
    "hence , when the system is @xmath20-symmetric ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , as considered in this work since the most original two - spin phases arise there , the particle - hole transformation @xmath24 allows for a mapping between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 a rescaled chemical potential . note that , such a transformation , if restricted to a single species and for @xmath28 amounts to changing the sign of @xmath5 .",

    "<S> we study the ground state properties of a frustrated two - species mixture of hard - core bosons on a triangular lattice , as a function of tunable amplitudes for tunnelling and interactions . by combining three different methods , a self - consistent cluster mean - field , exact diagonalizations and effective theories </S>",
    "<S> , we unravel a very rich and complex phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we discuss the existence of three original mixture supersolids : ( i ) a commensurate with frozen densities and supersolidity in spin degrees of freedom , in a regime of strong interspecies interactions ; and ( ii ) when this interaction is weaker , two mutually competing incommensurate supersolids . finally , we show how these phases can be stabilized by a quantum fluctuation enhancement of peculiar insulating parent states . </S>"
