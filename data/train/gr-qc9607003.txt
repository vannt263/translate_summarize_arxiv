    "in quantum field theory , unlike in classical physics , the energy density may be unboundedly negative at a spacetime point .",
    "such situations entail violations of all the known classical pointwise energy conditions , such as the weak energy condition @xcite .",
    "this fact has been known for quite sometime @xcite .",
    "specific examples include the casimir effect @xcite and squeezed states of light @xcite , both of which have observational support .",
    "the theoretical prediction of black hole evaporation @xcite also involves negative energy densities and fluxes in a crucial way . on the other hand ,",
    "if the laws of quantum field theory place no restrictions on negative energy , then it might be possible to produce gross macroscopic effects such as : violation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite or of cosmic censorship @xcite , traversable wormholes @xcite , `` warp drive''@xcite , and possibly time machines @xcite . as a result , much effort has been recently directed toward determining what constraints , if any , the laws of quantum field theory place on negative energy density .",
    "one approach involves so - called `` averaged energy conditions '' ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite ) , i.e. , averaging the local energy conditions over timelike or null geodesics .",
    "another method employs `` quantum inequalities '' ( qi s ) @xcite , which are constraints on the magnitude and duration of negative energy fluxes and densities .",
    "the current paper is another in a series which is exploring the ramifications of this approach @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( for a more comprehensive discussion of the history of these topics , see the introductions of refs.@xcite and the references therein . )",
    "the qi s have the general form of an inverse relation between an integral involving the the energy density or flux over a finite time interval and a power of that interval .",
    "more precise forms of the inequality were originally derived for negative energy fluxes @xcite , and later for negative energy density @xcite .",
    "this form of qi s involves `` folding '' the stress energy tensor into a `` sampling function '' , i.e. , a peaked function of time whose time integral is unity .",
    "for example , it was shown in ref.@xcite that for the free quantized massless scalar field in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime , @xmath0 for all choices of the sampling time , @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the renormalized expectation value of the energy density evaluated in an arbitrary quantum state @xmath3 , in the frame of an arbitrary inertial observer whose proper time coordinate is @xmath1 .",
    "the physical implication of this qi is that such an observer can not see unboundedly large negative energy densities which persist for arbitrarily long periods of time .",
    "the qi constraints can be considered to be midway between the local energy conditions , which are applied at a single spacetime point , and the averaged energy conditions which are global , in the sense that they involve averaging over complete or half - complete geodesics .",
    "the qi s place bounds on the magnitude and duration of the negative energy density in a _ finite neighborhood _ of a spacetime point along an observer s worldline .",
    "these inequalities were derived for minkowski spacetime , in the absence of boundaries .",
    "however , we recently argued @xcite that if one is willing to restrict the choice of sampling time , then the bound should also hold in curved spacetime and/or one with boundaries .",
    "for example , we proved that the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : inten ] ) holds in the case of the casimir effect for sampling times much smaller than the distance between the plates .",
    "it turns out that this observation has some interesting implications for traversable wormholes @xcite .",

    "this is just what one would expect due to the two polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "in the current paper , we have derived `` quantum inequality '' ( qi ) bounds on negative energy density for the quantized ( uncharged ) massive scalar and electromagnetic fields in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the bounds take the form of uncertainty principle - type inequalities on the magnitude and duration of the negative energy density seen by an arbitrary inertial observer .",
    "( note however that the energy - time uncertainty principle is _ not _ used as input to derive the qi bounds . )",
    "originally we had derived such a bound for the massless scalar field in both two and four - dimensional minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "our earlier four - dimensional derivation was performed using a rather complicated expansion of the mode functions in spherical waves .",
    "the present treatment is considerably simpler , as the analysis is done in a plane wave mode representation .",
    "we recover our previous results for the massless scalar field as the @xmath72 case of the massive scalar field . for the massive scalar field",
    ", we find that in general it is more difficult to obtain sustained negative energy densities than in the massless case .",
    "this is not surprising , as now one must overcome the positive rest mass energy . in the case of the electromagnetic field , the right - hand side of the bound is slightly weaker , i.e. , by a factor of @xmath112 , than in the massless scalar field case .",
    "this is also to be expected , given the two polarization degrees of freedom in the former case .",
    "for all of our qi bounds on energy density , in the infinite sampling time limit we sample over the entire timelike geodesic of the observer and obtain the averaged weak energy condition ( awec ) : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the unit tangent vector to the geodesic and @xmath115 is the observer s proper time .",
    "hence , in minkowski spacetime , the awec can be derived from the qi bound .",
    "note that in minkowski spacetime , our bounds hold for an arbitrary choice of the sampling time , @xmath1 .",
    "recently we argued that such bounds should also hold in a curved spacetime and/or one with boundaries , if the sampling time is restricted to be much smaller than the smallest local radius of curvature and/or the distance to any boundaries in the spacetime @xcite .",
    "an explicit example of the validity of this assumption has been given in ref .",
    "there a qi is derived in the static closed and open robertson - walker universe models . for a choice of sampling time which is small compared to the local radius of curvature",
    ", the qi reduces to our flat spacetime bound .",
    "the application of our bound to morris - thorne wormhole spacetimes @xcite , in the small sampling time limit , implied that typically either a wormhole must be only slightly larger than the planck size , or that the negative energy density must be concentrated in an extraordinarily thin band near the throat . as an example , in one case for a wormhole with a throat radius of @xmath116 , the negative energy density must be concentrated in a band _ no thicker _ than about a millionth of a proton radius . even for a wormhole with a throat radius the size of a galaxy",
    ", the band of negative energy must be no thicker than about @xmath117 proton radii ( for this particular type of wormhole ) @xcite .",
    "that analysis assumed that the stress energy tensor which maintained the wormhole consisted of quantized massless scalar fields .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath118 which generates the wormhole geometry was assumed to be the expectation value of the stress energy tensor operator of the massless scalar field in a suitable quantum state .",
    "the results of the present paper indicate that the same restrictions on the wormhole length scales will also apply if one tries to make the stress energy of the wormhole out of electromagnetic or massive scalar fields .",
    "one might hope that the constraints imposed by these bounds could be circumvented by the superposition of many fields , each of which individually satisfies a qi bound .",
    "however , we showed @xcite that in practice to achieve significant macroscopic effects , one needs either on the order of @xmath119 fields or a few fields for which the numerical constant on the right - hand side of the qi bound is many orders of magnitude larger than in the cases examined to date .",
    "neither of these possibilities seem very likely .",
    "it therefore appears probable that nature will always prevent us from producing gross macroscopic effects with negative energy .    0.2 in    * acknowledgements",
