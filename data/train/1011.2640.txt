    "one of the most interesting predictions of quantum field theory in the domain of cosmology is the possibility of transition between different vacuum states during the expansion of the universe . depending upon the topology of these states ,",
    "a series of stable topological defects such as domain walls , monopoles and cosmic strings can be formed . regarding the formation of strings",
    ", they may have self - interactions causing the formation of closed loops according to the so - called inter - commutation @xcite . in principle ,",
    "string loops start to oscillate and emit stochastic gravitational waves which results in their annihilation , @xcite while the infinite straight strings survive up to now .",
    "although , in some models of inflation such as false vacuum dominated inflation ( in the context of hybrid inflation theories ) , topological defects are formed at the end of inflation era @xcite , but the true focus on the issue of cosmic strings was in the recent years , mainly because new models of inflation derived from the superstring theory , result in acceptable possibility for the production of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "this is based on the consideration of cosmic string networks consisting of infinite strings , loops , and junctions of two or more strings which will definitely have effects such as lensing , cmb polarization , and of course cmb anisotropies .",
    "astrophysical evidence of cosmic string strongly depends on the two following parameters , namely : dimensionless string tension @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the newton s constant and @xmath6 stands for energy scale when the strings are created ) and inter - commuting probability , @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 shows the mass per unit length of cosmic string .",
    "the energy density of cosmic string is associated with the scale of phase transition and symmetry breaking in which cosmic strings are produced .",
    "generally the formation of cosmic strings could occur at very extended ranges of energy scale , e.g. the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale with @xmath9gev corresponding to @xmath10 , consequently there is a wide range of @xmath11s has been supposed @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the footprints of strings , such as anisotropies in cmb are directly affected by their tension .",
    "so determining the bounds for the tension , directly means limiting the fundamental theory on the basis of which cosmic strings are produced . to this end , observing the cosmic string footprints by using various approaches can be interpreted as a kind of observational evidence for the low energy limit of the superstring theory and would provide the most direct test of string theory and could rule out or constrain on particle physics models .    from theoretical and observational perspectives , there are a dozen constrains on the cosmic string s parameters .",

    "another method is the so - called wavelet domain bayesian denoising which has recently been used by d. k. hammond et al .",

    "a series of papers published by brandenberger and his collaborators have been devoted to the ability of so - called canny algorithm to detect the cosmic string and super strings according to kaiser - stebbins effect @xcite .",
    "they have concluded the lower bound of @xmath21 .",
    "actually in the canny method , the sharp and strength edges are picked up by means of the magnitude of the contrast from one side of produced edge to the other one @xcite .",

    "another most interesting method which is potentially able to discriminate map with and without cosmic strings as well as other topological defects is the so - called peak - peak correlation function @xcite . in this method ,",
    "two - point correlation function of the local maxima ( or minima ) of temperature fluctuations on the cmb map at a typical peak threshold is determined .",
    "f. heavens et al .",
    "have demonstrated that this correlation function for a simulated cmb map accompanying cosmic string grows up significantly at around @xmath22 arcminutes , relative to the pure gaussian map .",
    "as they claimed , this procedure has no adjustable parameter , consequently it can be powerful for test of gaussianity hypothesis as well as tracking the footprint of other mechanism for producing initial fluctuations in the upcoming high resolution observations .",
    "although , they did nt show the efficiency of this method for various values of @xmath0 which is the main purpose of this paper , but it is interesting reapply the same idea based on hotspots ( or coldspots ) framework . in our method",
    "not only we investigate all features of fluctuations instead of local extrema used in the peak - peak correlation function , but also the @xmath23moments of relevant quantity are used ( see section ii for more details ) .    in this study",
    "we are relying on a newly demonstrated method to put a lower limit on the tension of straight cosmic strings in the high resolution of cmb map for which we can discriminate their signatures .",
    "as the effect of cosmic strings , we concentrate on the discontinuities and fluctuations in the cmb map arising from the kaiser - stebbins effect which is a part of integrated sachs - wolfe effect and can produce observational consequences on the anisotropies in the cmb map .",
    "this feature is based on the gravitational lensing which was a well - established phenomena by the time @xcite .",
    "consider a string extended in the direction perpendicular to the paper ( see figure ( [ ks ] ) ) , and two photons emitted from a source in the background .",
    "choose two paths on opposite sides of the string that reach the same observer .",
    "if the string is moving in the direction perpendicular both to its length and to the line of sight between the source and observer , with the velocity @xmath24 , a frequency shift will occur between two photons . thus if we move across the cosmic string when sweeping the cmb we can see a jump in the anisotropy map .",
    "the amount of this jump is @xmath25 in which @xmath26 is the direction of observation , @xmath24 is the velocity of the string , @xmath27 its orientation , and @xmath28 is the lorentz factor for the string .",
    "eq.([kseq1 ] ) can provide a basis for detecting cosmic strings via direct observation of the cmb anisotropy map .",
    "however , it must be noted that since the kaiser - stebbins effect may be considerably smaller than the observed temperature fluctuations in wmap data , we can not expect to detect strings in the wmap data .",
    "meanwhile we are able to produce simulated maps of cmb with any set of parameters .",
    "so in order to examine the bounds on the string tension imposed from this analysis , we can use simulated maps to apply certain methods of statistical analysis on the inhomogeneities to detect the strings or to assume their existence and then obtain better bounds on string tension .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iv . summary and conclusions are presented in sec . v.     positive slope crossing at the level @xmath29 . ]",
    "after the innovation of rice for calculating the upcrossings and downcrossings of a stochastic signal at an arbitrary level @xcite , many studies have been devoted to signal processing as well as fluctuations of height of rough surfaces from the level crossing point of view as a powerful method in complex system @xcite . in the level crossing analysis , we are interested in determining the number crossings of the temperature fluctuations , @xmath30 , at an arbitrary level @xmath31 .",
    "we consider a sample function of temperature fluctuations which is defined on the homogeneous and isotropic random surface represented by @xmath32 at direction @xmath33 relative to the observer placed at the center of sphere . for a flat patch of cmb map , we assign temperature fluctuations to each point by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 demonstrate the coordinate positions . for convenience ,",
    "the origin of the coordinate system of the patch is placed in the left bottom of corresponding map .",
    "since we consider the statistical isotropy and homogeneity of temperature random field on the surface , without losing generality , we assume a one - dimensional slice of temperature fluctuations on a patch of cmb with size @xmath37 parallel to @xmath38 or @xmath39 axes .",
    "the size of this signal depends on the resolution of data set which is simulated or observed depicted by @xmath40 .",
    "also the numbers of pixels will be @xmath41 .",
    "now consider a sample of an ensemble of one dimensional signal of temperature fluctuation , @xmath42 , for which @xmath43 runs from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "suppose @xmath46 denotes the numbers of positive slope crossings ( upcrossings ) of , @xmath47 , for a typical sample size @xmath48 ( see figure ( [ level1 ] ) ) .",
    "the ensemble averaging for level crossing with positive slope is also given by : @xmath49 for a statistical isotropic and homogenous fluctuation , the ensemble averaging can be done on various one dimensional slices of fluctuations . for convenience , we chose these slices to be parallel to @xmath38 or @xmath39 axes . furthermore , the average number of crossings is proportional to the space ( time ) interval @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "hence : @xmath50 which @xmath51 is the average frequency of positive slope crossing of the level @xmath52 .",
    "it must be pointed out that in the long run processes the conservation law for upcrossings and downcrossings will be satisfied @xcite . in our analysis due to the statistical isotropy and 200 numbers of run over ensembles or even more , this conservation law statistically holds and so , we use the upcrossing events throughout our analysis .",
    "sketch of joint probability density function of a typical fluctuation and its derivative with respect to corresponding dynamical parameter ( angle ) in the level crossing theory .",
    "the shaded area indicates the total probability of crossing with positive slope at level @xmath53 . ]    from mathematical and statistical points of view , the frequency parameter @xmath51 can be deduced from the probability distributions associated with the temperature fluctuations , @xmath54 . in order to calculate this probability distribution function",
    ", we assume two necessary and sufficient conditions for crossing the level @xmath29 by the underlying signal with positive slope as follows : + 1 ) at the beginning of the interval we should have @xmath55 . + 2 ) the slope of signals should be larger or at least equal to the slope of line which is drawn between the point at the beginning of interval and the point located on the horizontal line of level @xmath31 ( figure ( [ level1 ] ) ) , namely : @xmath56}{d\\theta } > \\frac{\\alpha-\\left [ t(k_1 ) - \\langle t \\rangle \\right ] } { d\\theta}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "if the above - mentioned conditions are satisfied @xcite , we statistically expect to get a high probability for a crossing in the interval @xmath58 . in order to determine whether the above conditions are satisfied at any arbitrary location @xmath43 , we should find how the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are distributed by considering their joint probability density function , @xmath61 .",
    "for a specific level @xmath53 and interval @xmath58 , we focus on the values of @xmath62 and values of @xmath63 , corresponding to the region between the lines @xmath53 and @xmath64 in the plane ( @xmath65 ) ( see figure ( [ proba ] ) ) .",
    "subsequently , the probability of positive slope crossing of signal at level @xmath53 in the @xmath58 interval is given by : @xmath66 when @xmath67 , it is legitimate to put : @xmath68 since at large values of @xmath39 and @xmath69 , the probability density function approaches zero fast enough , eq.([1 ] ) may be written as : @xmath70 in this form , the integrand does not depend on @xmath39 so the first integral can be integrated easily : @xmath71 figure ( [ proba ] ) shows the area of interest for probability of upcrossings at level @xmath31 . as mentioned before , the average number of crossing with positive slope in interval @xmath37 is @xmath72 .",
    "so the average number of positive crossings of @xmath53 in interval @xmath58 is equal to the probability of positive crossings of @xmath53 in @xmath58 .",
    "we can write the average number of upcrossings at the level @xmath31 in terms of the joint probability density function as follows : @xmath73 or @xmath74 another useful parameter based on @xmath51 can be introduced as : @xmath75    obviously , for @xmath76 the above quantity determines total number of upcrossings for temperature fluctuations with positive slope at all levels . for a typical rough fluctuation , @xmath77 is larger than that of the smooth signal and consequently , this quantity is a criterion for the roughness of the processes . for a correlated signal , @xmath77 is smaller than that of a completely random one , while for anti - correlated data set @xmath77 is larger than the same series for which its memories have been destroyed by shuffling .",
    "figure ( [ hurst1 ] ) shows the level crossing results for some fractional gaussian noises ( fgn ) and the corresponding shuffled signals . for",
    "an anti - correlated series the so - called hurst exponent is @xmath78 , for a completely random gaussian data set @xmath79 and for a correlated signal @xmath80 @xcite . in addition , for moments @xmath81 , those terms in @xmath82 will become dominant that have small deviations from mean level , @xmath83 , which demonstrate the statistics of small fluctuations . on the contrary , for @xmath84 ,",
    "those terms with large fluctuations in the integrand of eq.([ntq ] ) are dominant in @xmath85 explaining the statistical properties of the upcrossings far from mean level .",
    "these terms correspond to the rare events .    in what follows",
    ", we are going to derive @xmath51 for discrete temperature fluctuations in the simulated map with and without cosmic strings on the flat sky and compare them to find a robust criterion to distinguish pure gaussian fluctuations from fluctuations containing cosmic string components .",
    "the motivation of using this simple method can be justified according to the following reasons : + i ) since the statistical isotropy is valid as a major statistical property @xcite , one can cut many one - dimensional signals in every directions and by ensemble averaging , compute the frequency of upcrossings ( downcrossings ) at all interested levels along with their variances .",
    "+ ii ) as one can see in the next section , the superposition of fluctuations produced by cosmic strings can generate new and extra ups and downs in temperature fluctuations , consequently finding such statistically meaningful footprints in the map in comparison with pure gaussian signature including instrumental noise may potentially help us to get deep insight in the cosmic string detections .",
    "+ iii ) due to the phase coefficient in the fourier analysis , it seems that many trivial imprints of cosmic strings diminish or at least are mixed with other observational phenomena so it is another motivation to investigate the imprint of cosmic strings in the real space as mentioned in ref .",

    "in this section , we describe in detail our sate - of - the - art code which has been written in fortran language by authors to simulate temperature fluctuations maps ( also for more details see refs @xcite ) . generally , our program has four parts : the first part creates pure gaussian fluctuations corresponding to the standard inflationary model in the presence of various models governing the evolution of background . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath6cdm model in the flat universe .",

    "will be done .",
    "as one can see in the following , we need a fine resolution map",

    "since the size of a typical loop of string is about @xmath101 @xcite ( see figure ( [ loop ] ) ) and the resolution of simulated map is of the order of one arc - minute so we can ignore the contribution of these closed strings and suppose that the main anisotropy in the string map is due to the straight cosmic strings .",

    "we expect the fluctuations in the presence of cosmic strings to be rougher than pure gaussian fluctuations .",
    "since the level crossing analysis is applicable for one - dimensional series we construct @xmath154-dimensional series from simulated map . furthermore due to the statistical isotropy property of simulated map @xcite",
    ", the @xmath154-dimensional data sets will be created in all given directions as different ensembles for analysis .",
    "actually these series contain temperature fluctuations as a function of pixels in one dimension in an arbitrary direction .",
    "hereafter we turn to investigate @xmath154-dimensional signals as an input for level crossing subroutine which is the final part of the main simulation program .",
    "we introduce the increment of fluctuation as : @xmath156 in figure ( [ level_temp ] ) we have plotted a typical @xmath154-dimensional increment series for gaussian and cosmic string signals embedded in gaussian fluctuations .",
    "we see that in the presence of strings , fluctuations near the mean as well as far from the mean have been changed .",
    "the magnitude of these changes depends on value of cosmic string tension .",
    "as pointed out before , we enumerate the number of crossings with positive slope at whole existence level for all @xmath154-dimensional data set in a map for a given @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that according to conservation law , for long - run simulation all crossings with negative slope are statistically equivalent to that of with positive slope @xcite .",
    "based on this analysis , we find many quantities which may be potentially used as a criterion to distinguish between the maps with and without straight cosmic strings . in figure ( [ level20 ] )",
    "we plot the @xmath157 versus @xmath31 for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "generally , total crossings in the gaussian map is less than that of with cosmic string . as we expect",
    ", the existence of instrumental noise decreases the efficiency of our analysis . to compare simulated maps we refer to the generalized form of roughness of signals which is given by eq.([ntq ] ) , @xmath158 . the various values for @xmath159",

    "we apply student s t - test for equal sample size and unequal mean and standard deviation for each @xmath159 s which is defined by : @xmath160     level crossing for increment of temperature fluctuations for various simulated components .",
    "the value of @xmath0 for left and right panel are @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively . ]",
    "generalized roughness function versus moment , @xmath159 , for gaussian@xmath163 string @xmath163 noise and gaussian @xmath163 noise .",

    "we run over 200 ensembles .",
    "the value of string s tension from left to right are @xmath131 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively . ]    here the symbols @xmath166 and @xmath167 stand for @xmath168 ( g ) and @xmath169 ( gs ) for simulated map without noise , respectively . for simulation including instrumental noise these symbols are replaced by @xmath170 ( gn ) and @xmath171 ( gsn ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath172 is the ensemble average of generalized roughness function for each @xmath159 s .",
    "the corresponding standard deviation is given by @xmath173 .",
    "@xmath174 indicates the number of simulated ensembles . the p - value , @xmath175 for @xmath176 based on t - distribution function with @xmath177 degrees of freedom , will be determined . by the combination of above p - values",
    "we introduce the following quantity : @xmath178 finally , the last p - value , @xmath179 associating to the @xmath180 by using chi - square distribution function for @xmath181 degrees of freedom will be computed . for @xmath182 significance level namely @xmath183",
    ", we can conservatively say that there exists a significance difference . according to the value of @xmath179 indicated in figure ( [ pvalue ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that our method can detect the cosmic string with @xmath1 and in the presence of anticipated instrumental noise the lower bound is @xmath184 .",
    "the final strategy for detecting cosmic string is as follows : at first by using a map from observation we compute @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "second we simulate a pure gaussian map with expected instrumental noise and again the level crossing and generalized roughness functions to be calculated .",
    "the p - value for deciding about the existence of significant difference between @xmath158 for real and simulated gaussian maps will be determined . in the case of significant difference",
    ", we change the value of @xmath0 for simulated gaussian map including cosmic strings and compute the corresponding @xmath179 . upon the @xmath179 for simulation to be equal to that of given for observation",
    "we conservatively can express the existence of cosmic strings in the observed map with mentioned @xmath0 .",
    "p - value as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we run over 200 ensembles to compute each point of this plot . to make more obvious we fitted data by typical fitting functions .",
    "in this paper we relied on a robust method in complex system which has been introduced originally to investigate the statistical properties of @xmath185-dimensional surface by mapping to @xmath154-dimensional data sets @xcite . using this method we explore the capability of finding the footprints of straight cosmic string based on the ks effect on the cosmic microwave background fluctuations since the last scattering epoch up to now . to this end",
    "we take a simple toy model to simulate the effect of cosmic strings demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite . the contribution of loops in this model can be ignored ( see figure ( [ loop ] ) ) .",
    "the superposition of kicks due to the embedded cosmic strings cause some additional statistical fluctuations in simulated map .",
    "consequently there exists a difference between the number of level crossing for whole reachable level in @xmath154-dimensional fluctuations of pure gaussian map in comparison with map containing cosmic strings . to quantify this deviation we introduced an increment signal and use robust quantity to take into account all deviations relative to pure gaussian fluctuations , namely generalized roughness function . for @xmath76",
    "the generalized roughness function corresponds to sum of upcrossings at all fluctuation levels which is a measure of roughness of underlying signals .",
    "based on joint probability density function of signal , @xmath186 , we found that the fluctuations near the mean fluctuations could be a proper criterion to discriminate pure gaussian map from the map induced by cosmic strings .",
    "our result shows that level crossing analysis could place a bound for cosmic string tension @xmath1 for 200 simulated maps with @xmath2 . to explore the contribution of instrumental noise we relied on south pole telescope experiment and took @xmath187 for noise map .",
    "the new bound for map including instrumental noise is @xmath188 .",
    "the small change in the bound on @xmath0 due to the noise could be justified regarding figure ( [ level20 ] ) .",
    "the sensitive part of @xmath189 is crossing near the mean value so the presence the undesired noise can only have minor statistical effects on the ability of this model to place a lower bound on the string s tension for small value of @xmath0 . in addition , our results for both simulations were not affected by increasing the size of ensemble up to 200 corresponding to increase the coverage of sky map . for the realistic observations",
    "there are additional problems to be addressed .",
    "the first one is the foreground and the instrumental noise which is supposed to be considered by adding expected noise and smoothing our simulation . as mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite discontinuity related to the scanning strategy also puts extra imprint on data set .",
    "it must point out that our method is sensitive to overall fluctuations in all directions , therefore , since it is expected that by increasing the coverage of underlying map the statistics of fluctuations near the mean to be significant , the mentioned spurious phenomenon will have a negligible contribution to the final result .",
    "however we can remove all parallel discontinuities in preferred direction imposed by scanning maneuvering of observational instrument @xcite .",
    "final remark is that we would like to use more realistic models @xcite to simulate a map taking all contributions of cosmic strings on the cosmic microwave background into account and implement our method to explore the effect of cosmic strings in our future works .",
    "in addition as a future study , it is useful to apply this method to distinguish the effect of generic cosmic strings and superstrings on the temperature fluctuations .",
    "the n - point peak - peak correlation function is also another method which could be used for the same purpose .",
    "we would like to thank h. firouzjahi and h. moshafi for useful comments and reading manuscript .",
    "also we thank the anonymous referee for his / her useful recommendations and comment regarding the peak - peak correlation function method .",
