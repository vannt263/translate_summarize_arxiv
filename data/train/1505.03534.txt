    "understanding how galaxies acquired their baryons over cosmic time is a key open question in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "how and when did galaxies of different types assemble the bulk of their stellar mass ?",
    "nearby galaxies are of particular relevance in this context : they constitute the present - day product of billions of years of evolution , so the past assembly history of these galaxies is encoded in the present - day spatial distribution of old stars within them .",
    "therefore , an accurate census of the current stellar structure of nearby galaxies provides essential constraints on the physics of galaxy formation and evolution . to address this critical issue , in this paper we present deep mid - infrared radial profiles for the more than 2300 galaxies in the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath0 g , see @xcite for the full survey description ) .",
    "large surveys of nearby galaxies traditionally have been carried out in the optical regime , for example the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 , @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , or the carnegie - irvine galaxy survey ( @xcite ) . however , translating optical measurements into stellar masses is not a straightforward task .",
    "on the one hand , the optical mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath3 ) is strongly dependent on the star formation history of the galaxy ( e.g@xmath4 @xcite ) . on the other hand , internal extinction by dust",
    "obscures a significant fraction of the optical output of galaxies ( e.g@xmath4 , @xcite ) .",
    "observations at near- and mid - ir bands can circumvent these issues . at these long wavelengths ,",
    "@xmath3 is only a shallow function of the star formation history , and dust extinction plays a minor role , leading to milder variations in @xmath3 compared to optical wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "several wide field ir surveys have been carried out over the years , such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite , see also @xcite ) , the deep near infrared survey ( denis , @xcite ) and more recently the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys provide robust number statistics , but at the expense of a shallow image depth , insufficient to map the stellar content in the faint outskirts of galaxies . in the case of",
    "wise , the spatial resolution at 3.4 and 4.6@xmath1 is relatively coarse ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "conversely , other surveys have obtained much deeper ir images for small samples of several tens or a few hundred objects .",
    "projects like these include the ohio state university bright galaxy survey ( osubgs , @xcite ) , the near - infrared atlas of s0-sa galaxies ( nirs0s , @xcite ) , the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings , @xcite ) and the spitzer local volume legacy survey ( lvl , @xcite ) .",
    "but a complete understanding of galaxy assembly involves many independent parameters , such as galaxy mass , morphology , environment , bar presence , gas and dark matter content , etc . with so many independent dimensions along which a sample should be sliced ,",
    "any sample with a few hundreds objects will be broken down into bins too small for a reliable understanding of the impact of any given parameter .",
    "s@xmath0 g  was specifically designed to answer the need for a deep , large and uniform ir survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "the survey contains over 2352 galaxies within 40mpc , away from the galactic plane ( @xmath6 ) , with an extinction - corrected b - band vega magnitude brighter than 15.5 and a b - band diameter larger than 1 .",
    "we observed these galaxies at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 with the infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) onboard spitzer ( @xcite ) .",
    "we followed the successful observing strategy of the sings and lvl programs , reaching azimuthally - averaged stellar mass surface densities @xmath7 ; this is a physical regime where the baryonic mass budget is dominated by atomic gas .",
    "the s@xmath0 g  images are processed through a suite of different pipelines designed to produce a wealth of enhanced data products .",
    "the first three pipelines are described in this paper .",
    "pipeline 1 ( p1 ) creates science - ready mosaics by combining all the individual exposures of each galaxy .",
    "pipeline 2 ( p2 ) masks out foreground stars , background galaxies and artifacts .",
    "pipeline 3 ( p3 ) performs surface photometry on the images and derives integrated quantities such as asymptotic magnitudes , isophotal sizes , etc .",
    "pipeline 4 ( p4 , @xcite ) uses galfit ( @xcite ) to decompose each galaxy into bulges , disks , bars , etc . finally , pipeline 5 ( p5 , @xcite ) combines the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 images to produce stellar mass maps via an independent component analysis , following the methodology developed by @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we describe the technical details and inner workings of p1 , p2 and p3 , as well as the resulting data products .",
    "then , we discuss two particular scientific applications of our data : the local stellar mass - size relation , and the physics behind the vast diversity of morphologies in galaxies with the same stellar mass .    for each galaxy we have obtained radial profiles both with fixed and free ellipticity and position angle . from these profiles",
    "we have also derived global measurements such as asymptotic magnitudes and stellar masses , isophotal sizes and ellipticities , and concentration indices .",
    "this dataset constitutes a unique tool to address many important issues on stellar structure , including but not limited to :    * the radial structure of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "our profiles constrain the radial distribution of stellar mass , which is a necessary ingredient when modelling rotation curves to infer the radial distribution of dark matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "* the scaling laws of disks ( @xcite ) , in particular the local stellar mass - size relation ( @xcite ) and , when kinematic data are available , the tully - fisher relation ( @xcite ) . * the inside - out assembly of disks , by comparing our profiles of old stars with uv and optical profiles probing younger stellar populations ( @xcite ) . * the local bar fraction and the sizes , strengths and shapes of bars ( @xcite ) . * radial migration of old stars and the assembly of galactic outskirts ( @xcite ) , in particular the study of breaks in radial projected surface density profiles and their links to bar resonances ( @xcite ) . * one - dimensional structural decompositions ( @xcite ) , from which one can derive physical parameters such as disk scale - lengths , bulge effective radii , bulge - to - disk ratios , etc .",
    "* the intrinsic face - on circularity of disks and their vertical thickness ( @xcite ) . * quantified galaxy morphology via non - parametric estimators such as concentration indices ( @xcite ) . * the internal structure of elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) , in particular their intrinsic axial ratios ( @xcite ) , their srsic indices ( @xcite ) and their boxy / disky structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec_sample ]",
    "we summarize our sample selection criteria and observations .",
    "section  [ sec_p1 ] contains a brief outline of the image reduction performed by p1 .",
    "a more detailed description can be found in appendix  [ app_p1 ] .",
    "the object masking procedure is described in section  [ sec_p2 ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec_p3 ] we explain our ellipse fitting technique and the resulting data products .",
    "readers interested in the scientific applications of these products can proceed to section  [ sec_results ] , where we discuss the stellar - mass size relation , as well as the variety of morphologies and radial concentration that we find at a fixed stellar mass . then",
    ", section  [ sec_irsa ] explains how to access and download our data .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_summary ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "to assemble the s@xmath0 g  sample we made use of the hyperleda database ( @xcite ) .",
    "we selected all galaxies with radio - derived radial velocity @xmath8km / s , which translates into a distance cut of @xmath9mpc for @xmath10kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 .",
    "we only considered galaxies with total corrected blue magnitude @xmath12 , blue light isophotal diameter @xmath13 , and galactic latitude @xmath6 .",
    "the final sample after applying all these selection criteria comprises 2352 galaxies .",
    "using radio - based velocities biases the sample against gas - poor early - type galaxies . however , our recently approved cycle 10 program ( prog .",
    "i d 10043 , pi : k. sheth ) will complete spitzer s legacy with archival and new observations of all @xmath14 early - type galaxies within the s@xmath0 g  volume , following the same observing strategy and selection cuts .    out of the 2352 s@xmath0 g  galaxies ,",
    "@xmath15% were already present in the spitzer archive as a result of previous programs carried out during the cryogenic phase .",
    "we observed the remaining @xmath16% during the post - cryogenic mission . in this regard ,",
    "from now on we will refer to the galaxies in our sample as either `` archival '' or `` warm '' , respectively .",
    "we observed the warm galaxies with a total on - source exposure time of 240s per pixel , and mapped them out to at least @xmath17 .",
    "depending on the apparent size of each galaxy , we used either a single dithered map or a mosaic of several pointings .",
    "each galaxy was observed in two visits separated by at least 30 days , in order to image the galaxy with two different orientations thanks to the rotation of the telescope .",
    "this allowed for a better correction of cosmetic effects , cosmic ray and asteroid removal , and subpixel sampling .",
    "most of the archival galaxies had been also mapped with at least 240s per pixel and out to @xmath18 .",
    "however , six archival galaxies had exposure times between 90 and 200s per pixel , and 125 were mapped out to less than @xmath19 .",
    "they represent a small fraction of the total sample , and only specific science goals are affected by this .",
    "we therefore decided not to reobserve these galaxies , as the incremental gain of repeating these observations would not have made up for the required additional observing time ( see @xcite for more details on the sample selection ) .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  [ app_p1 ] for a more detailed description of p1 . briefly speaking",
    ", p1 creates science - ready mosaics by combining the different exposures of each galaxy .",
    "the pipeline first matches the background level of the individual exposures , using the overlapping regions among them .",
    "it then combines all frames following standard dither / drizzle procedures ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final science - ready mosaics are delivered in units of mjysr@xmath11 , with a pixel scale of 0.75 .",
    "the fwhm of the psf at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 is 1.7  and 1.6 , respectively . for the farthest galaxies in our sample at @xmath20mpc ,",
    "this translates into a physical size of @xmath21pc .    besides the scientific images themselves",
    ", p1 also produces weight - maps showing how many individual frames cover each pixel of the final mosaics .",
    "for each galaxy in the sample , p2 creates masks of contaminant sources like background galaxies , foreground stars and artifacts .",
    "such masks are necessary for subsequent analysis such as background measurements and surface photometry ( p3 ) , 2d image decompositions ( p4 ) and mass map generation ( p5 ) .",
    "the mask creation procedure consists of two steps : ( i ) automatic generation of initial masks , and ( ii ) visual check and editing to create final clean masks .",
    "a first set of masks is automatically generated by running sextractor ( @xcite ) on the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 images ; the resulting segmentation maps constitute our initial raw masks .",
    "masking sources is relatively easy in those areas of an image with little or no emission from the main target galaxy .",
    "however , it becomes more complicated on top of the galaxy , where we need to avoid masking regions belonging to the galaxy itself .",
    "therefore , for each galaxy and band we create three automatic masks with high , medium , and low detection thresholds in sextractor that control how aggressively different sources are masked on the main body of the galaxy .    during the visual quality check step , for each galaxy we first choose the best mask among the three ones with different thresholds .",
    "this best mask is then visually inspected and edited by hand , masking additional sources missed by sextractor and unmasking any regions of the galaxy that may have been masked by mistake . in particular",
    ", we often have to manually add to the masks the extended haloes and diffraction spikes of bright stars .",
    "conversely , certain sources on the target galaxies like bright clumps or the ansae of bars are sometimes picked up by sextractor , and need to be excluded from the masks by hand .",
    "this editing process is performed with a custom code described in @xcite .",
    "this idl routine displays side by side the original and masked images , and provides several geometric shapes that the user can employ to interactively mask or unmask regions .",
    "the editing is first manually done on the 3.6@xmath1 images , and then the editing is automatically transferred to the 4.5@xmath1 ones , checking that artifacts remain properly masked .",
    "thus , we end up with two final , edited masks for each galaxy , one for each band .",
    "a sample mask is shown in fig .",
    "[ sample_mask ] .",
    "the masking process is to some extent subjective , especially for the faintest sources , due to the lack of color information .",
    "theses masks are mainly intended to remove extraneous sources that would significantly contaminate and distort our radial profiles and integrated magnitudes .",
    "therefore , users interested in specific structures such as very faint hii regions or globular clusters around our galaxies should not blindly use our masks without double - checking the nature of these sources with ancillary multi - wavelength data .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the inner workings of pipeline 3 . briefly speaking , p3",
    "first determines the background level of the images .",
    "it then locates the centroid of the galaxy and performs different sets of ellipse fits .",
    "finally , it measures several properties such as asymptotic magnitudes , isophotal sizes and concentration indices .",
    "a careful determination of the background level and noise is essential to perform reliable surface photometry .",
    "this is often done by placing several `` sky boxes '' around each galaxy and measuring the corresponding background statistics in them . with large samples such as s@xmath0 g",
    "it is desirable to implement this process in a way that is automatic yet flexible .",
    "pipeline 3 automatically places several sky boxes around each galaxy ( see fig .",
    "[ sample_mask ] ) .",
    "this is done by defining two concentric and adjacent elliptical annuli that surround the entire galaxy .",
    "each ring is then azimuthally subdivided into 45 sectors or boxes . since these boxes will contain in general a certain amount of masked pixels , each box is grown radially outwards until each one contains 1000 unmasked pixels .",
    "we then measure the median sky level and local rms inside each box , as well as the large - scale rms between the sky levels of all boxes .",
    "while the number of 1000 pixels per box is to some extent arbitrary , it is chosen to provide a reliable measurement of the local rms , while at the same time yielding boxes that are small enough to be easily accommodated within our images .",
    "note also that before using the p2 masks , we first grow the masked areas by 2 pixels to make sure that the faint wings of the psf do not contaminate our sky measurements .",
    "the sky boxes are initially placed by default at @xmath22 from the galaxy center , but this value is modified as needed for each galaxy in order to ensure a proper background subtraction . to do this ,",
    "we compare the values between the inner and outer rings to make sure that there are no significant differences , which could be a telltale sign of contamination from the galaxy itself .",
    "we double check this by verifying that the growth curve is flat ( see section  [ sec_magnitudes ] ) .",
    "we also check that the boxes are not too close to the frame edges ( which are noisier as a result of the dithering pattern ) , or that they do not fall in the adjacent frames ( which may have a somewhat different background value ) . in cases with a complicated background structure ,",
    "the pipeline allows one to manually distribute the sky boxes as deemed appropriate .    the distribution of measured background levels in the whole s@xmath0gsample is shown in fig .",
    "[ sky_hist ] .",
    "the histograms peak at @xmath23 and @xmath24abmagarcsec@xmath25  for the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 bands , respectively .",
    "it is illustrative to verify whether our measured values of the background level agree with theoretical expectations .",
    "the background in the s@xmath0 g  images is almost entirely dominated by zodiacal light ( or `` zodi '' ) coming from dust grains in the ecliptic plane .",
    "both the thermal emission of the grains and the scattered sunlight contribute to the zodi . at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 ,",
    "both contributions are roughly equal .",
    "thermal emission from interstellar cirrus in the milky way amounts to merely 1%-3% of the background in our images , as it peaks at much longer wavelengths ( and the s@xmath0 g  sample specifically avoids the galactic plane anyway ) .",
    "contamination by the unresolved cosmic infrared background is negligible at these bands compared to the zodi ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ sky_ecliptic ] shows how the observed sky level varies with the ecliptic latitude of each galaxy . as expected ,",
    "since the primary source of background emission at these wavelengths is zodi , the distribution clearly peaks in the ecliptic plane .",
    "for each galaxy we retrieved from the fits header the background level predicted for its galactic coordinates and epoch of observation.@xmath26 skydrkzb . ] the green curves in fig .",
    "[ sky_ecliptic ] are the upper and lower envelopes of these predicted values .",
    "we can see that both the dependency with ecliptic latitude and the range in background level at fixed latitude nicely agree with our measured values .",
    "interestingly , about 30 warm galaxies exhibit background levels at 3.6@xmath1 well above the predicted values .",
    "a visual inspection of these images revealed a recurrent diffuse artifact , both in the main frame where the galaxy is and in the flanking one ( fig .  [ backgr_artifacts ] ) .",
    "these few galaxies were observed in a narrow time window during august - september 2009 , very shortly after the spitzer s warm phase began .",
    "this smooth background artifact may be therefore due to the detector temperature and bias not being settled yet at that time .",
    "besides the background level itself , it is also important to characterize the background noise at different spatial scales , as this determines our ability to detect and measure faint structures at the outskirts of our galaxies . figure  [ sky_noise ] shows the distribution of the local , pixel - to - pixel noise in our images .",
    "the histogram for the warm galaxies is much narrower than that for the archival ones , which is expected given that the warm galaxies were imaged with the same observing strategy , whereas the archival come from a variety of different programs . in general",
    "we reach a local surface brightness sensitivity per pixel of @xmath27 and @xmath28abmagarcsec@xmath25  at @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "note , however , that these are values _ for individual pixels_. when measuring the flux of a given extended source , this noise component scales down with the square root of the number of pixels in the region where the measurement is being performed . in particular ,",
    "when measuring radial profiles at the outskirts of galaxies , this local noise component becomes negligible compared to the large scale background noise , which is given by the rms between the median sky values measured in the different boxes .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ sky_noise ] , this large scale component peaks at 26 - 26.5abmagarcsec@xmath25  at a @xmath29 level , and @xmath31abmagarcsec@xmath25  at @xmath30 . as a reference",
    ", @xmath32abmagarcsec@xmath25  corresponds to a stellar mass surface density of @xmath33 , adopting @xmath34 as measured by @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "+      once the background level and noise have been measured , our pipeline proceeds to perform surface photometry on the images .",
    "we first use the iraf task imcentroid to find accurate coordinates for the center of the galaxy .",
    "we then run the task ellipse ( @xcite ) to obtain radial profiles of surface brightness ( @xmath35 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath36 ) and position angle ( pa ) .",
    "we perform three separate runs of ellipse with different settings :    1 .",
    "* fixed center ; free @xmath36 and pa ; radial resolution @xmath37 .",
    "* we use these fits with a coarse radial increment to derive @xmath36 and pa in the outer parts of the galaxy , thus defining a global shape and orientation for each object . for each band , we provide values of @xmath36 and pa at two levels of surface brightness , @xmath38 and @xmath39abmagarcsec@xmath25 . after testing how sensitive these values",
    "are to variations in the sky subtraction , input fitting parameters , amount of masked objects , etc . , we recommend using the 25.5 values as they are more stable .",
    "* fixed center ; @xmath36 and pa fixed to the values at 25.5abmagarcsec@xmath25 ; @xmath40 . *",
    "these fits have a finer radial resolution that matches the irac psf at these wavelengths . by keeping @xmath36 and",
    "pa fixed and equal to the global outer values , these fixed - fits are ideal to measure disk scale - lengths , disk break radii , to perform 1d bulge - disk decompositions , etc .",
    "we also employ these profiles to measure the integrated magnitude of each galaxy from the growth curve ( sect .",
    "[ sec_magnitudes ] ) .",
    "* fixed center ;",
    "free @xmath36 and pa ; @xmath40 .",
    "* these free - fits with a fine resolution are well suited to study in detail the structural properties of features such as bars , which leave very characteristic signatures in the radial profiles of @xmath36 and pa .",
    "an example of these fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ sample_prof ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for simplicity and to improve the robustness of the fits ,",
    "once we measure the central coordinates of galaxy , these are kept fixed during the ellipse fitting .",
    "however , the pipeline allows one to leave the center as a free parameter too .",
    "we have in fact performed such fits to study individual galaxies with offset bars ( e.g@xmath4 ngc3906 , de swardt et al@xmath4 2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "we normally begin the ellipse fitting at an intermediate radius , typically between @xmath41 , using the optical @xmath36 and pa from hyperleda as input guesses for the fitting routine . starting at that initial radius , the ellipse fitting proceeds first outwards and then inwards .",
    "it should be noted that the ellipse algorithm was specifically designed for galaxies with a smooth radial brightness distribution .",
    "it therefore works correctly for elliptical galaxies , but it does not cope well with features such as spiral arms or rings that can significantly modify the local luminosity gradient . as a result , ellipse can sometimes stop fitting at a given radius in spiral galaxies .",
    "tuning the input parameters can sometimes fix this problem and provide a good fit , but in general this is a blind trial - and - error solution with an unpredictable outcome .",
    "some authors have in fact circumvented this issue by automatically running ellipse tens or even hundreds of times on each image , varying the initial fitting parameters each time until a good fit is obtained ( @xcite ) .",
    "while this approach can be practical in small images of distant galaxies , it is prohibitively time - consuming for the large images in s@xmath0 g , where a single fit can take up to several minutes ( and this is further complicated by the large number of galaxies in our sample ) .",
    "we thus decided to implement an optimized procedure that is better tailored to our needs .",
    "after each run of ellipse , the pipeline looks for any radial interval where the fit did not converge , and it then refits that particular radial interval alone .",
    "the process is then iterated several times to ensure that no radial gap is left unfit . in general most of our galaxies can be properly fit with a single ellipse run , but this automatic iterative process was of great help to handle troublesome cases that would have otherwise required considerable manual work .    in any case",
    ", for each galaxy we always visually inspect the output of the pipeline : we overlay the fitted ellipses on the galaxy image , and we plot the radial profiles of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and pa , making sure that the results accurately probe the different structures within the galaxy .",
    "dwarf galaxies can be particularly challenging for our pipeline .",
    "they are often partially resolved into stars in our images , and their clumpy and patchy appearance can sometimes fool the ellipse fitting algorithm . for these galaxies",
    "we recommend not to overinterpret any signature in the @xmath36 and pa profiles without inspecting the images themselves .",
    "since these galaxies normally lack well - defined large - scale structures such as bars , the profiles with fixed @xmath36 and pa are more suitable in these cases .",
    "we have released all these ellipse fits in the form of ascii tables containing the full output of the ellipse task .",
    "these tables not only include radial profiles of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and pa , but also other quantities such as the harmonic deviations from a perfect ellipse , which are commonly used to quantify the boxiness / diskiness of the isophotes at different radii ( e.g@xmath4 @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the usual output from ellipse , we also include in our ascii profiles additional columns that are specific to the irac data used here .",
    "in particular , the irac photometry needs to be corrected for the extended wings of the psf and the diffuse light that is scattered throughout the detector .",
    "here we rely on the extended source aperture correction provided in the irac instrument handbook .",
    "given an elliptical aperture with major and minor radii @xmath42 and @xmath43 , if @xmath44 is the total observed flux inside such an aperture , the corrected flux is given by : @xmath45 in this expression @xmath46 is the equivalent radius of the elliptical aperture , in arcseconds .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are equal to 0.82 , 0.370 and 0.910 , respectively , at 3.6@xmath1 , and 1.16 , 0.433 and 0.94 at 4.5@xmath1 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath50 is the surface brightness along an isophote ( rather than the total flux inside that radius as before ) , the aperture - corrected surface brightness can be obtained by performing a series expansion on the previous equation : @xmath51    our ascii tables include radial profiles with and without these aperture corrections .",
    "these corrections are estimated to be uncertain at a 5%-10% level .",
    "we have always applied the extended source aperture correction at all radii in our profiles . however",
    ", the reader should keep in mind that the point source corrections might be more suitable at very small radii ( @xmath52-@xmath53 ) , especially if the nucleus is bright and compact .",
    "finally , all the released profiles have been corrected for foreground extinction , using the color excess map of @xcite and the milky way extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 this extinction correction is typically around 0.005mag .",
    "the pipeline also estimates the uncertainty in @xmath35 , @xmath36 and pa at different radii . for @xmath36 and",
    "pa we rely on the errors determined by the ellipse task , which result from the internal errors in the harmonic fit ( @xcite ) . as for @xmath35 , the error provided by ellipse",
    "is derived from the rms of the pixel values along each isophote , so it mostly reflects azimuthal variations of the stellar emission at a given radius rather than the true uncertainty of the mean surface brightness at that radius .",
    "we therefore opted to measure the error in @xmath35 ourselves .",
    "if @xmath54 is the incident pixel intensity , prior to sky subtraction , and @xmath55 is the sky level , then the surface brightness is given by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 includes the magnitude zero - point plus any other global multiplying factor , such as the aperture corrections mentioned before . following the methodology detailed in @xcite and @xcite , the uncertainty in @xmath35 can be estimated as : @xmath58    the error in @xmath57 is dominated by the uncertainty in the aperture corrections , and is of the order of 5 - 10% as explained in the previous section . since any change in @xmath57 will merely translate into a global offset of the radial profiles , the values of @xmath59 in our ascii tables and plots",
    "do not explicitly include the contribution of @xmath60 .",
    "we computed @xmath61 , which is the error in the incident pixel intensity , by assuming poissonian statistics : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the effective gain and @xmath64 is the number of pixels within each isophote .",
    "the effective gain , in turn , was derived from the nominal detector gain and the exposure time of each pixel according to the weight maps .",
    "the term @xmath65 represents the uncertainty in the background level , and was obtained as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the local and large scale background rms , respectively , as described in section  [ sec_sky ] . here",
    "@xmath64 is , again , the number of pixels along a given isophote , and @xmath69 is the number of pixels inside the boxes used to measure the background level .",
    "the first term in eq .  [ eq_sky_err ] reflects the contribution of the local , pixel - to - pixel noise to the final error in the surface brightness .",
    "this contribution scales down as @xmath70 , so it becomes negligible at large radii , where the flux is averaged over a large number of pixels .",
    "it is the second term , the large - scale noise , the one that dominates the error budget at large radii .",
    "note that the measured rms between the sky values in the different boxes is partly contaminated by the local noise , in the sense that even if there were no true large - scale fluctuations , the rms between the sky boxes would be @xmath71 , on average .",
    "the correction term in eq .",
    "[ eq_sky_err ] accounts for this .      from the surface photometry we measure the asymptotic magnitude of each galaxy by extrapolating the growth curve to infinity .",
    "to do this we use the profiles with fixed @xmath36 and pa and 2   resolution . as an example",

    "here we use their measurements to derive extinction - corrected star formation rates ( sfr ) .    for each galaxy",
    "we first estimated the internal dust extinction via the integrated fuv@xmath96nuv color , following the prescription calibrated by @xcite on nearby galaxies .",

    ". it also overestimates the extinction in sdm - irr galaxies , which tend to have somewhat redder uv colors than other low - mass disks with similar dust content , possibly due to differences in the extinction law , dust geometry , or a bursty star formation activity .",
    "therefore , we only relied on the fuv@xmath96nuv color to determine the internal extinction in the disk - dominated galaxies of our sample .",
    "following @xcite , for elliptical galaxies we adopted a constant extinction in the fuv of 2mags , and 0.5mags in the case of sdm - irr galaxies .",
    "the extinction - corrected fuv luminosities were then converted into sfr via the calibration of @xcite .",
    "note that in elliptical galaxies most of the uv light is not associated to recent star formation , so their true sfr is lower than the value resulting from the @xcite prescription .",
    "the data - points in fig .",
    "[ cindex_mass ] are colored according to their specific sfr ( ssfr , the sfr per unit of stellar mass ) .",

    "figure  [ cindex_mass ] demonstrates that it is only in s0/a galaxies and earlier types that the ssfr drops below @xmath100 in highly - concentrated objects . in these galaxies",
    "the high - concentration and red colors result from the dominant contribution of large bulges and stellar haloes to the total light .",
    "but in the morphological range between sa and sbc , highly - concentrated galaxies still exhibit a relatively high ssfr of @xmath101 , similar to the ssfr of less concentrated galaxies in the same morphological regime .",
    "what is the physical nature of these galaxies with a concentrated stellar mass distribution but high ssfr ?",
    "a visual inspection of these objects reveals that they are a mixed bag of galaxies with very different physical properties , which can be nevertheless sorted out into three broad categories ( fig .",
    "[ high_cindex_ssfr ] ) :    1 .   barred galaxies with prominent nuclear rings , such as ngc  7552 , ngc  4593 or ngc  1365 .",
    "the strong bars in these galaxies drive gas inwards , but this gas eventually stalls in a nuclear ring , most likely associated with the inner lindblad resonance ( @xcite ) .",
    "this shrinks @xmath102 , the radius of the isophote containing 20% of the total luminosity of the galaxy , thus increasing the concentration index @xmath78 in these galaxies .",
    "note that given the intense star formation activity in nuclear rings and their elevated gas and dust content , non - stellar sources can locally dominate the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 emission in these rings .",
    "nevertheless , the clean stellar mass maps resulting from our pipeline  5 ( @xcite ) still reveal a prominent central concentration of stellar mass in these galaxies , indicating that bar - driven gas inflows play a key role in the secular assembly of ( pseudo-)bulges ( @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   interacting systems such as ngc  2782 , ngc  7714 or ngc  5534 .",
    "these galaxies often exhibit up - bending radial profiles , with a steep inner disk followed by a flatter outer one , normally accompanied by tidal features in the outermost regions .",
    "this decreases @xmath102 and increases @xmath103 , yielding high concentration indices .",
    "numerical simulations of minor mergers such as those by @xcite can reproduce this radial structure : the interaction leads to gas inflows that contract the inner radial profile , while at the same time the outwards transfer of angular momentum expands the outer disk .",
    "also , the ssfr is temporarily enhanced in these galaxies during the interaction , with prominent star forming knots that are clearly visible in the galex images .",
    "galaxies with compact bulges and smooth extended disks , often undisturbed as in ngc  3642 .",
    "this again leads to a small @xmath102 and large @xmath103 .",
    "while these extended outer disks often have low surface brightness in the infrared , they can be much brighter at uv wavelengths , as happens with ngc  3642 .",
    "these so - called extended uv disks are typically found in @xmath10410% - 20% of nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) , but the origin of these galaxy - wide star formation events is still under debate .",
    "+   +    in brief , for stellar masses above @xmath92 , galaxies with a centrally concentrated radial distribution of old stars are either ( a ) : quiescent galaxies with a prominent stellar bulge / halo , or ( b ) star - forming galaxies with central mass concentrations due to a variety of mechanisms such as bar- or merger - driven inflows .",
    "figure  [ cindex_mass ] shows that galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath92 still exhibit a considerable scatter in the concentration index at any given mass .",
    "while all these galaxies have concentration indices broadly consistent with a disk - dominated profile , the actual values can range anywhere from @xmath105 to @xmath106 . moreover",
    ", this scatter in @xmath78 does not seem to be correlated with changes in the ssfr , as was the case in the more massive galaxies analyzed before .",
    "to ascertain the origin of these structural variations in low mass disks , we visually inspected galaxies with the same stellar mass but extreme values of concentration . figure  [ sample_cindex ] displays several representative examples .",
    "the top two rows show very low - mass dwarf disks , all of them with stellar masses between @xmath107 .",
    "the objects in the first row are characterized by very low concentration indices of @xmath108 ( smaller than for an exponential profile ) , whereas those in the second row all have @xmath109 ( larger than for an exponential ) .",
    "this higher concentration is due to central aggregations of stars ( usually resolved in our images ) that are absent in the first group of galaxies .",
    "galex images of some of these concentrated dwarfs , like ngc  0059 and ngc  3738 , reveal bluer uv colors in the central parts than in the outskirts , possibly hinting to an outside - in formation for these objects .",
    "the third and fourth rows in fig .  [ sample_cindex ] correspond to more massive disks , with stellar masses between @xmath110 .",
    "galaxies in the third row present @xmath111 , while those in the fourth row have @xmath109 . in this case",
    "the higher concentration results from bright bars as in ngc  0600 or ngc  6140 .",
    "unbarred galaxies can be also concentrated if they host bright and compact ( pseudo-)bulges , as in ngc  3344 .",
    "in contrast , low concentrated disks in this mass range either have weakly - defined bars ( ngc  5147 ) or no bars at all ( ngc  5949 ) .",
    "moreover , some galaxies such as ngc  4353 have bright inner disks that lead to central plateaus in their radial profiles , leading to concentration indices lower than those expected for an exponential profile .",
    "we also find a wealth of asymmetric galaxies which may have recently undergone gravitational interactions . in some of them , like ngc  2793",
    ", the stellar mass is so dislodged that the radial surface density is almost flat , leading to very low concentration indices . on the other hand , galaxies like ngc  1637 exhibit a much milder asymmetry , and",
    "therefore have higher concentration values ( @xcite and references therein ) .    in summary , even though galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath92 tend to have low concentration , at any given mass variations in concentration are still present , due to the presence of central star clusters , bars , pseudo - bulges , or lack thereof .",
    "the mass - size relation provides very stringent constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution . from a cosmological point of view , the trend between increasing galaxy size and mass reflects , to first order , the physical connection between the mass of the dark matter halo and its angular momentum .",
    "indeed , in a @xmath112cdm cosmology the characteristic size of a disk should scale as @xmath113 ( @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "though , the stellar mass - size relation also depends on whether the halo gas conserves its angular momentum as it settles onto the disk , how efficiently that gas is later converted into stars , the impact of agn and stellar feedback , and whether internal and external processes rearrange stars within the galaxy .",

    "our 3.6@xmath1 and 4.5@xmath1 data peer through dust at the old stellar backbone of more than 2300 nearby galaxies of all morphological types in different environments .    in this paper",
    "we have described the methodology and algorithms of two of the pipelines in our data flow .",
    "pipeline 2 creates masks of foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "pipeline 3 measures the background level and noise , performs surface photometry on the images , and derives global quantities such as asymptotic magnitudes , stellar masses , isophotal sizes and shapes , and concentration indices .",
    "we find a structural transition between disk - dominated to bulge - dominated galaxies at stellar masses between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , concurrent with a drop in the specific sfr from @xmath97 to @xmath98 with increasing concentration .",
    "however , we find that not all galaxies with high stellar concentration indices are quiescent spheroidal systems .",
    "bars and mergers can yield central concentrations of stellar mass while at the same time enhancing the overall sfr of the galaxy .",
    "extended uv disks can also increase the sfr in the outer disk of galaxies that look otherwise compact in the irac bands .",
    "we have also studied the local stellar - mass size relation at 3.6@xmath1 , which is consistent with previous results , but has the advantage of being little influenced by gradients in dust extinction or stellar age and metallicity .",
    "early - type galaxies present an approximately constant stellar mass surface density of @xmath122 . in late - type galaxies",
    "the surface density decreases with mass from @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "given the large ancillary value of s@xmath0 g , we have made our enhanced data products available to the community through a dedicated webpage at irsa .",
    "this data release includes not only the products described in the present paper ( masks , radial profiles and derived global quantities ) , but also other enhanced products from our various pipelines , including science - ready mosaics and weight - maps , 2d image decompositions , and stellar mass maps .",

    "the s@xmath0 g  pipeline 1 is an evolved version of the irac pipeline used for the sings legacy program ( @xcite ) .",
    "a major change to the code from previous versions is the removal of a step to improve the registration of individual frames using cross - correlation , because the spitzer calibration now uses 2mass to improve the astrometry .",
    "also , sky subtraction has been moved into pipeline 3 .",
    "below we summarize the steps in the pipeline .",
    "the first step is optional and only occurs when the irac observations were taken in high dynamic range ( hdr ) mode . in this mode",
    "a short exposure is taken before the main exposure at each location .",
    "for the vast majority of the observations in the sample , the main observation is 30 seconds and the hdr exposure is 1.2 seconds . for new galaxies that were only observed during the warm mission we did not use hdr mode since very few have bright nuclei .",
    "if the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images have an hdr counterpart and the flux in the pixel is above @xmath143mjysr@xmath11 , the value from the normal bcd is replaced by the hdr one . in addition , we do a rough cosmic ray removal by replacing the value of the pixels in the normal bcd image with the value in the hdr pixel when the difference is above 3mjysr@xmath11 .",
    "before we can compare the sky level in overlapping bcd images , we must first correct each bcd for optical distortion and rotate the images to have the same orientation .",
    "this is required to get pixels to all have the same projeted size and orientation on the sky . to do this we use the drizzle routine and create a new optically corrected bcd image for each bcd image in the mosaic .",
    "once we have all the images with constant size on the sky we can find the matching regions of overlap .      for all pairs of overlapping bcd images where at least a minimum number of pixels ( nominally 20,000 ) overlap between the two images we find the background offset .",
    "to determine the background offset we find the difference in the 20th percentile pixel flux in both images . using the 20th percentile has several advantages over a mean or median .",
    "our goal is to find the change in the background level rather than any changes when pixels receive flux from resolved sources .",
    "sub - pixel changes in the telescope position will change the flux level of pixels observing a point source substantially with the irac undersampled optics .",
    "these same sub - pixel changes do not affect the observations of the unresolved background .",
    "also , some detector artifacts such as mux bleed and column pull down can affect large areas leading to biases in even the median , while using the 20th percentile value minimizes the bias .",
    "once we have the background offset between each pair of overlapping bcd images , we used the method of @xcite to find the background offset for each image that minimizes the residuals .",
    "this method performs a least square minimization of the residuals using a single offset that is applied to each image .    due to their small size",
    ", many sample galaxies were not observed in irac mapping mode but instead were observed in dither mode . in this case two ( or even three ) non - overlapping regions of the sky are observed and there is a need of additional information to obtain a solution .",
    "therefore , when the regions of the sky do not overlap we add in an offset between a bcd image in each region of the sky . this will force the sky level to be similar between the non - overlapping regions of the sky .",
    "the set of measured offsets of overlapping images does not provide a zero point for the solution , which requires having an external paramenter fixed to set the zero point for the relative offsets . to minimize the effect of applying the offsets on the background level",
    ", we place the additional constraint that the average offset should have a value of 0 .",
    "once we know the correction that needs to be applied , we create a corrected version of each input bcd image .",
    "the final mosaics are created using the standard stdas pyraf task drizzle .",
    "the resuling images have a plate scale of 0.75  per pixel and are oriented to have north to the top .",
    "we have to make a correction to the output of the drizzling task to recover the correct photometry .",
    "drizzle assumes the pixels have units of flux instead of surface brightness .",
    "we apply a correction to account for the smaller pixel area in the final mosaic .",
    "drizzle also returns a weight map that shows the number of seconds of integration time for each final pixel .",
    "this image is also included in the s@xmath0 g  archive and is used by subsequent s@xmath0 g  pipelines .    in the final step we update the fits header to include a list of the astronomical observation requests ( aors ) that contributed to the final mosaic and set all the pixels outside of the field of view to have the value of nan .                                                            , g. , de vaucouleurs , a. , corwin , jr .",
