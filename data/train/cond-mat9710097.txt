    "critical phenomena at perfect , flat surfaces of three  dimensional crystals have attracted much interest . in particular , surface critical exponents have been estimated , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the general agreement is quite satisfactory [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "+ nevertheless , there are still some open questions . for example",
    ", the critical exponent @xmath1 of the surface magnetization at the ordinary transition in the ising universality class seems to be known only to an accuracy of about ten percent , with @xmath1 @xmath2 0.80 @xmath3 0.05 , obtained from large scale monte carlo simulations [ 4,5 ] , renormalization group calculations [ 6,7 ] , and experiments on magnets and alloys such as feco [ 3,8 ] .",
    "+ in addition , the role of surface imperfections , unavoidable in real materials , on critical properties has been studied for three  dimensional systems in much less detail ( for exceptions , see , e.g. , mean  field theory [ 9 ] and renormalization group arguments [ 10 ] on surface layers with randomness ) , especially in simulations .",
    "+ the aim of this article is twofold .",
    "firstly , the values of critical surface exponents for perfect surfaces at the ordinary transition in ising systems have been reexamined by computing effective exponents allowing to monitor easily the approach to the true asymptotic behaviour and to refine previous estimates on the asymptotic exponents , e.g. , on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , we have also performed monte carlo simulations for two types of imperfections , corresponding to simple cases of amorphous and corrugated surfaces , see fig .",
    "the amorphous surface is mimicked by choosing randomly weak or strong nearest - neighbour ferromagnetic couplings between spins in the flat surface layer .",
    "a corrugation is introduced in a simple manner by placing a terrace of monoatomic height on half of the surface ; the magnetization at the step edge is expected to reflect most strongly this form of perturbation as compared to the magnetization at the perfect surface .",
    "+ the article is organized accordingly , concluded by a brief summary .",
    "to simulate the critical behaviour of the perfect surface , we study ising models on simple cubic lattices with free boundary conditions for the top and bottom ( surface ) layers and periodic boundary conditions otherwise .",
    "the spins are denoted by @xmath4 ( @xmath3 1 ) , situated at lattice sites @xmath5 , where @xmath6 numbers the layers , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 spins per layer ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) .",
    "interactions are restricted to nearest  neighbours .",
    "two different , ferromagnetic couplings may occur , depending on whether the neighbouring spins are at the surface ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 , or not , @xmath14 , see fig . 1a . + the phase diagram of the corresponding semi  infinite ( @xmath15 ) ising model is well established [ 1,2 ] .",
    "if the ratio of the surface coupling @xmath16 to the bulk coupling @xmath17 , @xmath18 , is sufficiently weak , the system undergoes at the bulk critical temperature , @xmath19/@xmath17 @xmath2 4.5115 [ 11,12 ] , an ordinary transition , with the bulk and surface ordering occurring at the same temperature , @xmath20 . beyond a critical ratio , @xmath21 @xmath2 1.50 [ 5 ] ,",

    "one encounters the special transition point , with critical properties of the surface transition deviating from those at the ordinary or the distinct surface transition .",
    "+ the aim of our simulations has been to reexamine the surface critical properties at the ordinary transition , because of the rather wide spread of supposedly accurate and reliable estimates of the critical exponents , especially of the exponent of the surface magnetization , @xmath1 .",
    "+ to study both surface and bulk properties , we computed various quantities , among others the profiles of the magnetization per layer , @xmath24 , and the susceptibility per layer , @xmath25 , defined by + m(z)=    and    ( z)= .    0.5 cm for @xmath26(or @xmath12 ) ,",

    "spin flips .",
    "system sizes ranged from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , thereby attempting to avoid finite  size effects on approach to the phase transition ; i.e. computing properties of the semi  infinite system . to equilibrate the system and to extract thermal averages",
    ", we usually generated a few @xmath35 clusters , and determined error bars from typically 5 realizations .",
    "various ratios @xmath18 of the surface to the bulk couplings were chosen , in between @xmath36 and 2.0 , studying predominantly the ordinary transition at @xmath37 .",
    "+ typical magnetization profiles are depicted in fig .",
    "3 , at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the magnetization increases from its surface value , @xmath30 , to the bulk value @xmath39 , at distances superceeding the bulk correlation length . to avoid finite",
    " size effects , @xmath40 and @xmath12 have to be sufficiently large .",
    "firstly , @xmath12 may be chosen such that the profile @xmath24 displays a pronounced plateau around the center of the system .",
    "monitoring then the @xmath41dependence of @xmath30 , one may determine the suitable size of the monte carlo system . in fig .",
    "3 , we included also the value of the bulk magnetization , as had been obtained in extensive and highly accurate previous simulations [ 12 ] , thereby giving another check on the quality of the present data .",
    "+ in order to estimate the critical exponents of the magnetization , we define an effective exponent @xmath42 by    _ eff(z , t)= d ( m(z))/d ( t )    where @xmath43 is the reduced temperature .",
    "certainly , on approach to @xmath20 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 becomes the asymptotic exponent @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the critical exponent of the surface magnetization .",
    "+ results for @xmath42 are shown in fig .",
    "4 , at fixed temperatures , @xmath48 , and in fig . 5 , at fixed distances from the surface , @xmath6 . because the simulations are performed at discrete temperatures , @xmath49 , @xmath45 is replaced by    _ eff(z , t)= ( m(z , t_i)/m(z ,",

    "very accurate monte carlo data are required to get reliable estimates .",
    "error bars may be assigned to the effective exponents in various ways .",
    "we adopted the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 follows from the variance of the magnetization data due to the different realizations , i.e. monte carlo runs with different random numbers .",
    "these error bars are rather conservative as compared , for instance , to those resulting from standard error propagation assumptions . + from fig . 5",
    ", one sees that the effective exponent of the surface magnetization @xmath53 increases almost linearly with @xmath48 over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "note that we omitted , for clarity , data which are obviously affected by finite - size effects .",
    "a linear extrapolation to the critical point yields @xmath0 .",
    "this value is expected to correct and refine the previous estimates [ 3 - 8 ] , ranging from 0.75 [ 5 ] to 0.845 [ 7 ] .",
    "it is nicely consistent with the value estimated from a log - log plot for simulational data in between @xmath54 , with @xmath55 [ 4 ] ( being , presumably , slightly too low , because the rise of @xmath45 with smaller @xmath48 had been neglected ) .",
    "+ in the non ",
    "asymptotic region , the surface magnetization may be cast in the form @xmath56 . from the data depicted in fig .",
    "5 , the effective exponent @xmath57 of the corrections to scaling has been estimated to be close to one ( @xmath58 ) , in the range @xmath59 .",
    "+ moving from the surface into the bulk , the effective exponent is usually lowered , see fig .",
    "4 . eventually , one may observe an interesting crossover phenomenon , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . away from criticality , @xmath20 , and sufficiently deep in the bulk ( e.g. @xmath60 )",
    ", the effective exponent follows closely the behaviour of the effective bulk critical exponent , as obtained from the corresponding magnetization data of the ising model with full periodic boundary conditions [ 12 ] . however , on approach to @xmath20 , when the bulk correlation length becomes comparable to the distance from the surface (= 10 lattice spacings , in the example ) , @xmath45 crosses over to its surface value .",
    "indeed , at each distance ( large , but finite ) from the surface , one reaches , sufficiently close to @xmath20 , the surface exponent @xmath61 instead of the bulk exponent @xmath62 .",
    "+ the susceptibility per layer , @xmath25 , displays close to @xmath20 , at the ordinary transition , @xmath63 , a non  monotonic behaviour , see fig .  6 , with the maximal value shifting towards the center of the system as the temperature gets larger .",
    "in analogy to ( 5 ) , one may define an effective exponent @xmath64 . in the bulk",
    ", that exponent is clearly positive , with a value around one at @xmath65 , rising quite sharply to at least about 1.5 on further approach to @xmath20 ( finally , finite  size effects tend to decrease the effective exponent again ) .",
    "however , @xmath66 remains , at @xmath20 , finite at the surface , @xmath67 , with a cusp - like singularity , i.e. a negative critical exponent @xmath68 , by approaching criticality from high temperatures [ 1,2 ] . to estimate @xmath68",
    ", we determined the temperature @xmath69 at which , for a finite system @xmath70 , @xmath29 exhibits its maximum , @xmath71 .",
    "a suitably defined effective exponent is    ( _ 11)_eff(t_m)= -d(_11^m - _ 11(t_m))/d(t_m )    with @xmath72= @xmath73 .",
    "obviously , @xmath74 as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "based on our monte carlo data at @xmath63 , this ansatz leads to a rather rough estimate of @xmath68 , circumventing finite  size effects again , with @xmath78 .",
    "this value may be compared to results of previous simulations [ 4 ] , where only the sign of @xmath68 was identified , and to predictions of renormalization group calculations [ 1,2,6,7 ] , @xmath79 .",
    "+ the critical exponent for the response function of the surface magnetization to a bulk field , @xmath31 , may be estimated in a more standard and straightforward way , by computing in analogy to ( 5 ) the effective exponent    ( _ 1)_eff(t ) = -d(_1(t))/d(t )    at @xmath80 , that exponent decreases with t , on approach to @xmath20 , approximately linearly in the range @xmath81 . a linear extrapolation yields the asymptotic exponent @xmath82 , in agreement with previous estimates [ 1,2,4 ] .",
    "+ we performed additional , albeit much less extensive simulations near the special point , @xmath83 . in particular , at @xmath84 , @xmath85 is found to increase more strongly than linearly , at least down to @xmath86 , so that an extrapolation to @xmath44 is not obvious .",
    "a reasonable estimate seems to be @xmath87 , in good agreement with a fairly recent large scale monte carlo study , @xmath88 [ 5 ] , but a little bit lower than the field theoretical value , @xmath89 [ 7 ] .",
    "similarly , our estimate for @xmath90 is slightly higher than that suggested by a renormalization group calculation , @xmath91 [ 7 ] . in any event , the agreement is reasonably satisfactory .",
    "+ beyond the special point , @xmath21 , the critical exponents at the surface transition , @xmath22 , are believed to be in the universality class of the two  dimensional ising model [ 1,2 ] .",
    "indeed , our monte carlo data are consistent with that prediction. at this point , we draw attention to recent monte carlo simulations on short - range correlation functions near the surface transition , @xmath92 , which have been performed to interpret spin - polarized photoelectron data of some magnets [ 15 ] .",
    "to mimic an amorphous surface , possibly due to ( non-)magnetic impurities at the surface of the crystal , we replace the unique surface coupling @xmath16 by two random , ferromagnetic interactions , being either strong , @xmath93 , or weak , @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95 , see fig .",
    "1b. note that an alternate form of randomness , namely random surface fields , had been considered before using monte carlo techniques [ 16 ] .",
    "+ following detailed simulations of the two - dimensional dilute ising model [ 17,18 ] , both couplings were assumed to occur with the same probability .",
    "then the ratio @xmath96 measures the degree of dilution : @xmath97 corresponds to the perfect case , and @xmath98 to the percolation limit .",
    "we performed most of the simulations at @xmath99 , where critical dilution effects are expected to be easily detectable , because the crossover length to the dilution dominated critical regime is only a few lattice constants [ 17 ] .",
    "the ratio of the surface to bulk couplings @xmath100 was varied in between 1.0 and 3.5 , to study critical phenomena at the ordinary transition and to locate the special point , @xmath101 .",
    "for instance , @xmath102 is realized when @xmath103 and @xmath104 , for @xmath105 .",
    "the sizes of monte carlo systems and lengths of runs were chosen like in the perfect case .",
    "+ because the critical temperature ( thence , the effective interaction ) of the corresponding two  dimensional system is reduced by randomness , at given mean coupling @xmath106 [ 17 ] , the special point may be argued to be shifted towards larger ratios @xmath23 , as dilution is increased ( indeed , at @xmath99 , for example , we locate @xmath23 at @xmath107 , see below , to be compared with 1.50 for the perfect surface ) .",
    "accordingly , at @xmath102 and @xmath99 the ordinary transition is encountered .",
    "we shall discuss our findings for that case first , comparing it to results for the perfect surface , @xmath108 .",
    "certainly , the transition temperature @xmath20 is not affected by the randomness in the surface couplings .",
    "+ at fixed temperature , @xmath38 , the dilution tends to decrease the magnetization @xmath24 at and near the surface , for distances small compared to the bulk correlation length .",
    "this trend is shown in fig . 7 for the surface magnetization , @xmath30 . at first sight , perhaps , somewhat surprisingly , the energy per layer @xmath109 is also lowered compared to the perfect situation , but only in the surface layer .",
    "this behaviour may be explained by the ordering in clusters of strongly interacting , @xmath110 , spins , with a weak coupling between these , possibly oppositely oriented , clusters .",
    "+ despite the obvious drop in @xmath30 due to the surface randomness , the ratio of @xmath111 is almost constant , about 0.9 , over a wide range of temperatures , from @xmath112 up to @xmath20 , with a very shallow minimum near @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the effective critical exponent @xmath53 , see eq . ( 5 ) , follows very closely that of the perfect case , as shown in fig .",
    "8 , leading to the same estimate for @xmath0 , obtained from a linear extrapolation towards @xmath20 of the data for the effective exponent .",
    "thence , the randomness in the surface couplings seems to be irrelevant for the asymptotic behaviour of the surface magnetization , and of minor importance even for the corrections to scaling .",
    "similarly , the estimate for @xmath114 is compatible with the one in the perfect case . obviously , the numerical findings provide support to the conjecture by diehl and nsser , suggesting that short - range correlated dilution of surface interactions is irrelevant for surface critical exponents , based on a harris  type criterion [ 19 ] and perturbation - theory to first ",
    "order [ 10]. the findings are corroborated by exact and simulational results on two  dimensional ising models with surfaces , where @xmath1 is 1/2 , independent of surface dilution [ 20,21]. interestingly enough , in three ",
    "dimensional ising models , random surface fields seem to be irrelevant as well [ 16 ] .",
    "+ to locate the special point , @xmath115 , one may determine the surface transition temperature , @xmath92 . at @xmath116 , @xmath117 , while @xmath118 otherwise .",
    "standard procedures may be applied , e.g. , by analysing the finite  size dependence of the turning point in @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting phase diagram near the special point , for @xmath119 , is depicted in fig .",
    "+ however , close to the special point , @xmath92 deviates only minutely from @xmath20 , and ambiguities may arise . to get easily a lower bound for @xmath23 , one may monitor effective exponents , e.g. , @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , in the random case with @xmath119 , at @xmath120 , i.e. slightly above @xmath121 , @xmath45 rises sharply at @xmath122 , being consistent with the asymptotic value @xmath123 .",
    "even at @xmath124 , the effective exponent still tends to increase on approach to @xmath20 , to a value close to that of the perfect surface at the special transition , @xmath125. an estimate for an upper bound for @xmath23 may be obtained by assuming @xmath126 , and looking for inconsistencies in the critical exponents .",
    "in particular , such an inconsistency occurs when @xmath53 becomes smaller than 1/8 .",
    "based on that kind of analysis , in addition to the standard procedures , we reached at an upper bound @xmath127 . in summary , a reasonable estimate of @xmath128",
    "seems to be @xmath107 . to refine it ,",
    "more sophisticated methods are needed [ 5 ] , which , however , are beyond the scope of this study .",
    "the important point is , to notice that @xmath23 shifts towards a higher value when diluting the surface interactions .",
    "to study effects of corrugation on surface critical phenomena , we shall consider here thermal properties at a step of monoatomic height , superimposed on a perfect surface . + as in the perfect case , we consider systems with @xmath8 spins per @xmath129 layer , with the exception of the topmost layer , @xmath130 , where spins are restricted to the center half , forming a strip - like terrace of monoatomic height along the @xmath131direction , with two bordering steps , see fig .",
    "1c . at the bottom , @xmath132 ,",
    "the surface is assumed to be flat .",
    "+ three kinds of interactions may be introduced .",
    "spins at the step - edges are coupled ferromagnetically , @xmath133 .",
    "other spins at the top ( or bottom ) of the system , having no upper ( lower ) neighbouring spins , interact through the surface coupling @xmath13 , while all the remaining spins are coupled by @xmath14 .",
    "the phase diagram in the ( @xmath134)plane is expected to be identical to that of the perfect surface [ 1 ] , because the couplings at the one  dimensional step  edges do not support additional long  range ordering .",
    "+ to quantify the influence of the additional terrace , we calculated the magnetization per row    m(x , z)= .",
    "the magnetization at the step ",
    "edges , say , @xmath135 , @xmath136 is of particular interest , deviating possibly most significantly from the magnetization of the perfect surface , @xmath30 .",
    "certainly , the aim is to identify the behaviour at a single step , i.e. the width of the terrace has to be large compared to the relevant correlation lengths , as it is the case in the limit of the semi  infinite system , ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "therefore , careful finite  size analyses are needed again , considering the effect of all three linear dimensions , @xmath137 , on the quantities of interest , especially @xmath138 . for instance",
    ", on approach to criticality , @xmath20 , the length of the step , @xmath139 , is of importance [ 21 ] . to monitor and , eventually , circumvent finite  size effects , @xmath41 ranged from 80 to 120 , @xmath139 from 80 to 240 , and @xmath12 from 40 to 80 .",
    "as before , we used the one  cluster  flip monte carlo algorithm , generating a few @xmath35 clusters , and averaging typically over about 5 realizations .",
    "10 , the magnetization per row , @xmath140 , is depicted at fixed temperature near the ordinary transition , taking @xmath141 , for various layers , starting at the top , @xmath130 , and moving into the bulk .",
