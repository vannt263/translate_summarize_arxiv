    "one of the main purpose of various heavy - ion collision programmes running at various places such as relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is to understand the properties of strongly interacting matter and to study the possibility of a phase transition from a confined hot , dense hadron gas ( hg ) phase to a deconfined and/or chiral symmetric phase of quark matter called as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . by colliding heavy - ions at ultrarelativistic energies such",
    "a phase transition is expected to materialize and qgp can be formed in the laboratory .",
    "unfortunately , the detection of the qgp phase is still regarded as an uphill task .",
    "however , the existence of a new form of a matter called as strongly interacting qgp ( sqgp ) has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "there are many compelling evidences @xmath4 , elliptic flow , high energy densities and very low viscosity etc .",
    "@xcite . however , we do not have supportive evidence that this fluid is associated with the properties quark deconfinement and/or chiral symmetry restoration which are considered as direct indication for qgp formation @xcite . although various experimental probes have been devised , but a clean unambiguous signal has not yet been outlined in the laboratory .",
    "so our prime need at present is to propose some signals to be used for the detection of qgp .",
    "however for this purpose , understanding the behaviour and the properties of the background hg is quite essential because if qgp is not formed , matter will continue to exist in the hot and dense hg phase . in the ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , a hot and dense matter",
    "is formed over an extended region for a very brief time and it is often called a fireball. the quark matter in the fireball after subsequent expansion and cooling will be finally converted into hg phase .",
    "recently , the studies of the transverse momentum spectra of dileptons @xcite and hadrons @xcite are used to deduce valuable information regarding temperature , energy density of the fireball .",
    "the schematic diagram for the conjectured space - time evolution of the fireball formed in the heavy - ion collisions is shown in fig",
    ". 1 @xcite .",
    "the space - time evolution consists of four different stages as follows : ( @xmath5 ) in the initial stage of collisions , labeled as `` pre - equilibrium '' in fig .",
    "1 , processes of parton - parton hard scatterings may predominantly occur in the overlap region of two colliding nuclei , thus depositing a large amount of energy in the medium .",
    "the matter is still not in thermal equilibrium and perturbative qcd models can describe the underlying dynamics as a cascade of freely colliding partons .",
    "the time of the pre - equilibrium state is predicted to about @xmath6 or less .",
    "( @xmath7 ) after the short pre - equilibrium stage , the qgp phase would be formed , in which parton - parton and/or string - string interactions quickly contribute to attain thermal equilibrium in the medium .",
    "the energy density of this state is expected to reach above @xmath8 , equivalent to the temperature of @xmath9 .",
    "the volume then rapidly expands and matter cools down .",
    "( @xmath10 ) if the first order phase transition is assumed , the `` mixed phase '' is expected to exist between the qgp and hadron phases , in which quarks and gluons are again confined into hadrons at the critical temperature @xmath11 . in the mixed phase",
    ", the entropy density is transferred into lower degrees of freedom , and therefore , the system is prevented from a fast expansion .",
    "this leads to a maximum value in the lifetime of the mixed phase which is expected to last for a relatively long time ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "( @xmath13 ) in the hadronic phase , the system keeps collective expansion via hadron - hadron interactions , decreasing it s temperature .",
    "then , the hadronic interactions freeze after the system reaches a certain size and temperature , and hadrons freely stream out from the medium to be detected .",
    "there are two types of freeze - out stages .",
    "when inelastic collisions between constituents of the fireball do not occur any longer , we call this as chemical freeze - out stage .",
    "later when the elastic collisions also cease to happen in the fireball , this stage specifies the thermal freeze - out .        since many experiments running at various places measure the multiplicity , ratios etc . of various hadrons",
    ", it is necessary to know to which extent the measured hadron yields indicate equilibration .",
    "the level of equilibration of particles produced in these experiments is tested by analyzing the particle abundances @xcite or their momentum spectra @xcite using thermal models .",
    "now , in the first case one establishes the chemical composition of the system , while in the second case , additional information on dynamical evolution and collective flow can be extracted .",
    "furthermore , study of the variations of multiplicity of produced particles with respect to collision energy , the momentum spectra of particles , and ratios of various particles have led to perhaps one of the most remarkable results corresponding to high energy strong interaction physics @xcite .",
    "recently various approaches have been proposed for the precise formulation of a proper equation of state ( eos ) for hot and dense hg .",
    "lacking lattice qcd results for the eos at finite baryon density @xmath14 , a common approach is to construct a phenomenological eos for both phases of strongly interacting matter . among those approaches ,",
    "thermal models are widely used and indeed are very successful in describing various features of the hg .",
    "these models are based on the assumption of thermal equilibrium reached in hg .",
    "a simple form of the thermal model of hadrons is the ideal hadron gas ( ihg ) model in which hadrons and resonances are treated as pointlike and non - interacting particles .",
    "the introduction of resonances in the system is expected to account for the existence of attractive interactions among hadrons @xcite .",
    "but in order to account for the realistic behaviour of hg , a short range repulsion must also be introduced .",
    "the importance of such correction is more obvious when we calculate the phase transition using ihg picture which shows the reappearance of hadronic phase as a stable configuration in the simple gibbs construction of the phase equilibrium between the hg and qgp phases at very high baryon densities or chemical potentials .",
    "this anomalous situation @xcite can not be explained because we know that the stable phase at any given @xmath15 is the phase which has a larger pressure .",
    "once the system makes a transition to the qgp phase , it is expected to remain in that phase even at extremely large @xmath1 and @xmath2 due to the property of asymptotic freedom of qcd .",
    "moreover , it is expected that the hadronic interactions become significant when hadrons are densely packed in a hot and dense hadron gas . one significant way to handle the repulsive interaction between hadrons is based on a macroscopic description in which the hadrons are given a geometrical size and hence they will experience a hard - core repulsive interaction when they touch each other and consequently a van - der waals excluded - volume effect is visible . as a result , the particle yields are essentially reduced in comparison to that of ihg model and also the anomalous situation in the phase transition mentioned above disappears . recently , many phenomenological models incorporating excluded - volume effect have been widely used to account for the properties of hot and dense hg @xcite .",
    "however , these descriptions usually suffer from some serious shortcomings .",
    "first , mostly the descriptions are thermodynamically inconsistent because one does not have a well defined partition function or thermodynamical potential ( @xmath16 ) from which other thermodynamical quantities can be derived @xmath4 the baryon density ( @xmath14)@xmath17 .",
    "secondly , for the dense hadron gas , the excluded - volume model violates causality ( i.e. , velocity of sound @xmath18 in the medium is greater than the velocity of light ) .",
    "so , although some of the models explain the data very well but such shortcomings make the models mostly unattractive .",
    "sun @xmath19 @xcite have incorporated the effect of relativistic correction in the formulation of an eos for hg .",
    "however , such effect is expected to be very small because the masses of almost all the hadrons present in the hot and dense hg are larger than the temperature of the system , so they are usually treated as non - relativistic particles except pions whose mass is comparable to the temperature but most of the pions come from resonances whose masses are again larger than the temperature of hg @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two - source thermal model of an ideal hadron gas is used to analyze the experimental data on hadron yields and ratios . in this model ,",
    "the two sources , a central core and a surrounding halo , are in local equilibrium at chemical freeze - out .",
    "it has been claimed that the excluded - volume effect becomes less important in the formulation of eos for hadron gas in the two - source model .",
    "another important approach used in the formulation of an eos for the hg phase is mean - field theoretical models @xcite and their phenomenological generalizations @xcite .",
    "these models use the local renormalizable lagrangian densities with baryonic and mesonic degrees of freedom for the description of hg phase .",
    "these models rigorously respect causality .",
    "most importantly they also reproduce the ground state properties of the nuclear matter in the low - density limit .",
    "the short - range repulsive interaction in these models arises mainly due to @xmath20-exchange between a pair of baryons .",
    "it leads to the yukawa potential @xmath21 , which further gives mean potential energy as @xmath22 .",
    "it means that @xmath23 is proportional to the net baryon density @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath23 vanishes in the @xmath24 limit . in the baryonless limit ,",
    "hadrons ( mesons ) can still approach point - like behaviour due to the vanishing of the repulsive interactions between them .",
    "it means that in principle one can excite a large number of hadronic resonances at large @xmath1 .",
    "this will again make the pressure in the hg phase larger than the pressure in the qgp phase and the hadronic phase would again become stable at sufficiently high temperature and the gibbs construction can again yield hg phase at large @xmath1 .",
    "in some recent approaches this problem has been cured by considering another temperature dependent mean - field @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the sum of particle and anti - particle number densities . here",
    "@xmath25 represents van - der waals hard - core repulsive interaction between two particles and depends on the total number density @xmath26 and is non - zero even when net baryon density @xmath14 is zero in the large temperature limit @xcite .",
    "however , in the high - density limit , the presence of a large number of hyperons and their unknown couplings to the mesonic fields generates a large amount of uncertainty in the eos of hg in the mean - field approach .",
    "moreover , the assumption of how many particles and their resonances should be incorporated in the system is a crucial one in the formulation of eos in this approach .",
    "the mean - field models can usually handle very few resonances only in the description of hg and hence are not as such reliable @xcite .    in this review ,",
    "we discuss the formulation of various thermal models existing in literature quite in detail and their applications to the analysis of particle production in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we show that it is important to incorporate the interactions between hadrons in a consistent manner while formulating the eos for hot , dense hg . for repulsive interactions , van - der waals type of excluded - volume effect",
    "is often used in thermal models while resonances are included in the system to account for the attractive interactions .",
    "we precisely demand that such interactions must be incorporated in the models in a thermodynamically consistent way .",
    "there are still some thermal models in the literature which lack thermodynamical self - consistency .",
    "we have proposed a new excluded - volume model where an equal hard - core size is assigned to each type of baryons in the hg while the mesons are treated as pointlike particles .",
    "we have successfully used this model in calculating various properties of hg such as number density , energy density etc .. we have compared our results with those of the other models .",
    "further , we have extracted chemical freeze - out parameters in various thermal models by analyzing the particle - ratios over a broad energy range and parameterized them with the center - of - mass energy .",
    "we use these parameterizations to calculate the particle - ratios at various center - of - mass energies and compare them with the experimental data .",
    "we further provide a proposal in the form of freeze - out conditions for a unified description of chemical freeze - out of hadrons in various thermal models .",
    "an extension of the thermal model for the study of the various transport properties of hadrons will also be discussed .",
    "we also analyze the rapidity as well as transverse mass spectra of hadrons using our thermal model and examine the role of any flow existing in the medium by matching the theoretical results with the experimental data .",
    "thus the thermal approach indeed provides a very satisfactory description of various features of hg by reproducing a large number of experimental results covering wide energy range from alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) to large hadron collider ( lhc ) energy .",
    "various types of thermal models for hg using excluded - volume correction based on van - der waals type effect have been proposed .",
    "thermal models have often used the grand canonical ensemble description to write the partition function for the system because it suits well for systems with large number of produced hadrons @xcite and/or large volume . however",
    ", for nonrelativistic statistical mechanics , the use of a grand canonical ensemble is usually just a matter of convenience @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the canonical ensemble can be used in case of small systems ( @xmath4 peripheral nucleus - nucleus collisions ) and for low energies in case of strangeness production @xcite due to canonical suppression of the phase space .",
    "similarly some descriptions also employ isobaric partition function in the derivation of their hg model .",
    "we succinctly summarize the features of some models as follows :      in the hagedorn model @xcite , it is assumed that the excluded - volume correction is proportional to the pointlike energy density @xmath27 .",
    "it is also assumed that the density of states of the finite - size particles in total volume @xmath28 can be taken as precisely the same as that of pointlike particles in the available volume @xmath29 where @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the eigen volume of the @xmath32 particle in the hg .",
    "thus , the grand canonical partition function satisfies the relation : @xmath33 the sum of eigen volumes @xmath34 is given by the ratio of the invariant cluster mass to the total energy density and @xmath35 is the fugacity i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "hence @xmath37 and the energy density @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath27 is the energy density when particles are treated as pointlike .",
    "now , using the expression for @xmath29 , one finally gets : @xmath39 when @xmath40 , @xmath41 which is obviously the upper limit for @xmath42 since it gives the energy density existing inside a nucleon and usually regarded as the latent heat density required for the phase transition . here",
    "@xmath43 represents the bag constant .",
    "the expressions of number density and pressure can similarly be written : @xmath44 @xmath45    here , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the number density and pressure of pointlike particles , respectively .      in order to include van - der waals type of repulsion between baryons , cleymans @xmath48 @xcite assigned an equal hard - core radius to each baryon .",
    "consequently , the available volume for baryons is @xmath49 , here @xmath31 is the eigen volume of @xmath32 baryon and @xmath50 is the total number . as a result ,",
    "the net excluded number density , pressure and the energy density of a multi - component hg are given as :    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are net baryon density , pressure , energy density of pointlike particles , respectively and @xmath56 is the fraction of occupied volume .",
    "kuono and takagi @xcite modified these expressions by considering the existence of a repulsive interaction either between a pair of baryons or between a pair of anti - baryons only . therefore , the expressions ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) take the form : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath46 and @xmath60 are the number density of the pointlike baryons and antibaryons respectively , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the corresponding energy density and pressure .",
    "similarly , @xmath63 are the number density , pressure and energy density of pointlike mesons , respectively .      the above discussed models",
    "possess a shortcoming that they are thermodynamically inconsistent because the thermodynamical variables like @xmath64 can not be derived from a partition function or thermodynamical potential ( @xmath16 ) e.g. @xmath65 .",
    "several proposals have come to correct such type of inconsistencies .",
    "rischke @xmath48 @xcite have attempted to obtain a thermodynamically consistent formulation . in this model ,",
    "the grand canonical partition function @xmath66 for pointlike baryons can be written in terms of canonical partition function @xmath67 as :    @xmath68    they further modified the canonical partition function @xmath67 by introducing a step - function in the volume so as to incorporate excluded - volume correction into the formalism .",
    "therefore , the grand canonical partition function ( 11 ) finally takes the form : @xmath69 the above ansatz is motivated by considering @xmath70 particles with eigen - volume @xmath71 in a volume @xmath28 as @xmath70 pointlike particles in the available volume @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "but , the problem in the calculation of above eq .",
    "( 12 ) is the dependence of the available volume on the varying number of particles @xmath70 @xcite . to overcome this difficulty one should use laplace transformation of eq .",
    "( 12 ) . using the laplace transform ,",
    "one gets the isobaric partition function as : @xmath73 or , : @xmath74\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "finally , we get a transcendental type of equation as follows : @xmath77 where , @xmath78 the expressions for the number density , entropy density , and energy density in this model can thus take a familiar form like : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 these equations resemble with equations ( 5 ) , and ( 7 ) as given in cleymans - suhonen model @xcite with @xmath82 replaced by @xmath83 .",
    "the above model can be extended for a hadron gas involving several baryonic species as follows : @xmath84 where ,    @xmath85    with @xmath86 .",
    "particle number density for the @xmath32 species can be calculated from following equation : @xmath87 unfortunately , the above model involves cumbersome , transcendental expressions which are usually not easy to calculate .",
    "furthermore , this model fails in the limit of @xmath88 because @xmath89 becomes negative in this limit .",
    "singh @xmath48 ,  @xcite have proposed a thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume model in which the grand canonical partition function using boltzmann approximation can be written as follows : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the degeneracy factor and the fugacity of @xmath32 species of baryons , respectively .",
    "@xmath93 is the magnitude of the momentum of baryons .",
    "@xmath31 is the eigenvolume assigned to each baryon of @xmath32 species and hence @xmath94 becomes the total occupied volume where @xmath95 represents the total number of baryons of @xmath96 species .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 23 ) as : @xmath97 where integral @xmath98 is @xmath99 thus we have obtained the grand canonical partition function as given by eq . (",
    "24 ) by incorporating the excluded volume effect explicitly in the partition function .",
    "the number density of baryons after excluded - volume correction ( @xmath100 ) can be obtained as :    @xmath101    so our prescription is thermodynamically consistent and it leads to a transcendental equation : @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the fractional occupied volume .",
    "it is clear that if we put the factor @xmath104 and consider only one type of baryons in the system then the above eq .",
    "( 27 ) can be reduced to the thermodynamically inconsistent expression ( 5 ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( 27 ) thus removes the thermodynamical inconsistency . for single component hg , the solution of eq .",
    "( 27 ) can be taken as : @xmath106}{\\lambda\\,exp[-1/i\\,v^0\\,\\lambda]}.\\ ] ] for a multi - component hadron gas , eq .",
    "( 27 ) takes the following form : @xmath107 using the method of parametric space  @xcite , we write : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the parameter and @xmath110 gives the space .",
    "we finally get the solution of eq .",
    "( 29 ) as follows : @xmath111dt^{'}}{\\exp(-t)/g(t)},\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is a parameter such that :    @xmath112    and , @xmath113 if @xmath114 s and @xmath110 are known , one can determine @xmath109 .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 is fixed by setting @xmath115 and one obtains @xmath116 , here the subscript 1 denotes the nucleon degree of freedom and @xmath117 is the total number of baryonic species .",
    "hence by using @xmath118 and @xmath119 one can calculate @xmath120 .",
    "it is obvious that the above solution is not unique .",
    "since it contains some parameters such as @xmath109 , one of which has been fixed to zero arbitrarily .",
    "alternatively , one can assume that @xcite : @xmath121 here an assumption is made that the number density of @xmath32 baryon will only depend on the fugacity of same baryon .",
    "then the eq .",
    "( 29 ) reduces to a simple form as : @xmath122 the solution of eq .",
    "( 35 ) can be obtained in a straight forward manner as @xcite : @xmath123 where @xmath124 now , r can be obtained by using the following relation : @xmath125 where @xmath126 here @xmath127 is the ratio of the occupied to the available volume .",
    "finally , @xmath100 can be written as : @xmath128 the solution obtained in this model is very simple and easy .",
    "there is no arbitrary parameter in this formalism so it can be regarded as a unique solution .",
    "however , this theory still depends crucially on the assumption that the number density of @xmath32 species is a function of the @xmath114 alone and it is independent of the fugacities of other kinds of baryons .",
    "as the interactions between different species become significant in hot and dense hg , this assumption is no longer valid .",
    "moreover , one serious problem crops up , since we can not do calculation in this model for @xmath129 mev ( and @xmath130 mev ) .",
    "this particular limiting value of temperature and baryon chemical potential depends significantly on the masses and the degeneracy factors of the baryonic resonances considered in the calculation .    in order to remove above discrepancies , mishra @xmath19 @xcite",
    "have proposed a thermodynamically consistent eos for a hot and dense hg using boltzmann s statistics .",
    "they have proposed an alternative way to solve the transcendental eq .",
    "we have extended this model by using quantum statistics into the grand canonical partition function so that our model works even for the extreme values of temperature and baryon chemical potential .",
    "thus the eq .",

    "( 27 ) takes the following form after using the quantum statistics in the partition function : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the partial derivative of @xmath134 with respect to @xmath135 .",
    "we can write r in an operator equation form as follows @xcite : @xmath136",
    "where @xmath137 with @xmath138 ; @xmath46 is the density of pointlike baryons of ith species and the operator @xmath139 has the form : @xmath140 using neumann iteration method and retaining the series upto @xmath141 term , we get @xmath142 after solving eq .",
    "( 45 ) , we finally get the expression for total pressure @xcite of the hadron gas as : @xmath143 here @xmath144 is the pressure due to jth type of meson .    here we emphasize that we consider the repulsion arising only between a pair of baryons and/or antibaryons because we assign each of them exclusively a hard - core volume . in order to make the calculation simple , we have taken an equal volume @xmath145 for each type of baryons with a hard - core radius @xmath146 .",
    "we have considered in our calculation all baryons and mesons and their resonances having masses upto a cut - off value of @xmath147 and lying in the hg spectrum . here only those resonances which possess well defined masses and widths have been incorporated in the calculations . branching ratios for sequential decays have been suitably accounted and in the presence of several decay channels , only dominant mode is included .",
    "we have also imposed the condition of strangeness neutrality strictly by putting @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the strangeness quantum number of the ith hadron , and @xmath150 is the strange ( anti - strange ) hadron density , respectively . using this constraint equation",
    ", we get the value of strange chemical potential in terms of @xmath151 .",
    "having done all these things , we proceed to calculate the energy density of each baryon species i by using the following formula : @xmath152 similarly entropy density is : @xmath153    it is evident that this approach is more simple in comparison to other thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume approach which often possesses transcendental final expressions @xcite .",
    "our approach does not involve any arbitrary parameter in the calculation .",

    "one of the most remarkable success of thermal models is in explaining the multiplicities and the particle ratios of various particles produced in heavy - ion experiments from the lowest sis energy to maximum lhc energy .",
    "some properties of thermal fireball are found to be common to all collision energies which give a universal freeze - out conditions in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "now , we review the applicability of thermal models in deriving some useful chemical freeze - out criteria for the fireball .",
    "recent studies @xcite predict that following empirical conditions to be valid on the entire freeze - out hypersurface of the fireball : @xmath240 energy per hadron always has a fixed value at @xmath241 , @xmath242 sum of baryon and anti - baryon densities @xmath243 , @xmath244 normalized entropy density @xmath245 .",
    "further , cleymans @xmath48 @xcite have found that all the above conditions separately give a satisfactory description of the chemical freeze - out parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 in an ihg picture only .",
    "moreover , it was also found that these conditions are independent of collision energy and the geometry of colliding nuclei .",
    "furthermore , cleymans @xmath48 @xcite have hinted that incorporation of excluded - volume correction leads to wild as well as disastrous effects on these conditions .",
    "the purpose in this section is to reinvestigate the validity of these freeze - out criteria in excluded - volume models .",
    "along with these conditions , a condition , formulated by using percolation theory is also proposed as a chemical freeze - out condition @xcite .",
    "an assumption is made that in the baryonless region the hadronic matter freezes - out due to hadron resonances and vacuum percolation , while in the baryon rich region the freeze - out takes place due to baryon percolation .",
    "thus the condition which describes the chemical freeze - out line is formulated by following equation @xcite : @xmath246+\\frac{0.34}{v_h}\\frac{n_b(t,\\mu)}{n(t,\\mu)},\\ ] ] where @xmath247 is the volume of a hadron .",
    "the numbers 1.24 and 0.34 are obtained within percolation theory @xcite .     with @xmath0 .",
    "ihg model calculation is shown by dash dotted line , cleymans - suhonen and rgsg model calculation shown by dashed and dotted line respectively .",
    "solid line shows the calculation by our model ]    in fig .",
    "13 , we have shown the variation of @xmath248 with respect to @xmath0 at the chemical freeze - out point of the fireball .",
    "the ratio @xmath248 shows a constant value of 1.0 in our model and it shows also a remarkable energy independence .",
    "similarly the curve in ihg model shows that the value for @xmath248 is slightly larger than one as reported in @xcite .",
    "however , results support the finding that @xmath248 is almost independent of energy and also of the geometry of the nuclei .",
    "most importantly we notice that the inclusion of the excluded - volume correction does not change the result much which is contrary to the claim of cleymans @xmath48 @xcite . the condition @xmath249 was successfully used in the literature to make predictions @xcite of freeze - out parameters at sps energies of 40 and 80 a gev for pb - pb collisions long before the data were taken @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have also shown in fig .",
    "13 , the curves in the cleymans - suhonen model @xcite and the rgsg model @xcite and we notice a small variation with @xmath0 particularly at lower energies . in fig .",
    "14 , we study a possible new freeze - out criterion which was not proposed earlier .",
    "we show that the quantity entropy per particle i.e. @xmath250 yields a remarkable energy independence in our model calculation .",
    "the quantity @xmath251 describes the chemical freeze - out criteria and is almost independent of the centre - of - mass energy in our model calculation .",
    "however , the results below @xmath252 do not give promising support to our criterion and reveal some energy - dependence also .",
    "this criterion thus indicates that the possible use of excluded - volume models and the thermal descriptions at very low energies is not valid for the hg .",
    "similar results were obtained in the rgsg , cleymans - suhonen and ihg model also @xcite .",
    "the conditions @xmath253 @xmath249 and @xmath251 at the chemical freeze - out form a constant hypersurface from where all the particles freeze - out and all kinds of inelastic collisions cease simultaneously and fly towards the detectors .",
    "thus all particles attain thermal equilibrium at the line of chemical freeze - out and when they come out from the fireball they have an almost constant energy per particle ( @xmath254 ) and entropy per particle ( @xmath255 )",
    ". moreover , these values are independent of the initial collision energy as well as the geometry of the colliding nuclei .",
    "our finding lends support to the crucial assumption of hg fireball achieving chemical equilibrium in the heavy - ion collisions from the lowest sis to rhic energy and the eos of the hg developed by us indeed gives a proper description of the hot and dense fireball and its subsequent expansion .",
    "however , we still do not get any information regarding qgp formation from these studies .",
    "the chemical equilibrium once attained by the hot and dense hg removes any memory regarding qgp existing in the fireball before hg phase .",
    "furthermore , in a heavy - ion collision , a large amount of kinetic energy becomes available and part of it is always lost during the collision due to dissipative processes . in thermal description of the fireball , we ignore the effect of such processes and we assume that all available kinetic energy ( or momentum ) is globally thermalized at the freeze - out density .",
    "experimental configuration of the collective flow developed in the hot , dense matter reveals the unsatisfactory nature of the above assumption .",
    "transport coefficients are very important tools in quantifying the properties of strongly interacting relativistic fluid and its critical phenomena i.e. , phase transition , critical point etc . @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations cause the system to depart from equilibrium and a non - equilibrated system is created for a brief time .",
    "the response of the system to such fluctuations is essentially described by the transport coefficients e.g. , shear viscosity , bulk viscosity , speed of sound etc .",
    "recently the data for the collective flow obtained from rhic and lhc experiments indicate that the system created in these experiments behaves as strongly interacting perfect fluid @xcite , whereas we expected that qgp created in these experiments should behave like a perfect gas .",
    "the perfect fluid created after the phase transition indicate a very low value of shear viscosity to entropy ratio so that the dissipative effects are negligible and the collective flow is large as obtained by heavy ion collision experiments @xcite . there were several analytic calculations for @xmath256 and @xmath3 of simple hadronic systems @xcite along with some sophisticated microscopic transport model calculations @xcite in the literature .",
    "furthermore , some calculations predict that the minimum of shear viscosity to entropy density is related with the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "similarly sound velocity is an important property of the matter created in heavy ion collision experiments because the hydrodynamic evolution of this matter strongly depends on it .",
    "a minimum in the sound - velocity has also been interpreted in terms of a phase transition @xcite and further , the presence of a shallow minimum corresponds to a cross - over transition @xcite . in view of the above ,",
    "it is worthwhile to study in detail the transport properties of the hg in order to fully comprehend the nature of the matter created in the heavy - ion collisions as well as the involved phase transition phenomenon . in this section ,",
    "we have used thermal models to calculate the transport properties of hg such as shear viscosity to entropy ratio etc . @xcite .",
    "we calculate the shear viscosity in our thermal model as was done previously by gorenstein @xmath48 @xcite using rgsg model .",
    "according to molecular kinetic theory , we can write the dependence of the shear viscosity as follows @xcite : @xmath257 where @xmath26 is the particle density , @xmath258 is the mean free path , and @xmath259 is the average thermal momentum of the baryons or antibaryons .",
    "for the mixture of particle species with different masses and with the same hard - core radius @xmath260 , the shear viscosity can be calculated by the following equation @xcite : @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the number density of the ith species of baryons ( anti - baryons ) and @xmath26 is the total baryon density . in fig .",

    "furthermore , various experimental observables such as transverse momentum spectra , elliptic flow etc .",
    "indicate the presence of the thermodynamical pressure developed in the early stage , and correlations which are expected in a thermalized medium .",
    "we have discussed a detailed formulation of various excluded - volume models and their shortcomings .",

    "we have used quantum statistics in the grand canonical partition function of our model so that it works even at extreme values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 where all other models fail . moreover , our model respects causality .",
    "we have presented the calculations of various thermodynamical quantities such as entropy per baryon and energy density etc . in various excluded - volume models and compare the results with that of a microscopic approach urasima .",

    "we have calculated various particle ratios at various @xmath0 and confronted the results of various thermal models with the experimental data and find that they are indeed successful in describing the particle ratios .",

    "we have calculated some conditions such as @xmath248 , @xmath250 etc . at chemical freeze - out points and attempted to test whether these conditions involve energy independence as well as independence of structure of the nuclei involved in the collisions .",
    "we find that @xmath357 , and @xmath251 are the two robust freeze - out criteria which show independence of the energy and structure of nuclei .",
    "moreover , the calculations of transport properties in our model match well with the results obtained in other widely different approaches .",
    "further , we present an analysis of rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra of hadrons in central nucleus - nucleus collision at various @xmath0 using our eos for hg .",
    "we see that the stationary thermal source alone can not describe the experimental data fully unless we incorporate flow velocities in the longitudinal as well as in the transverse direction and as a result , our modified model predictions show a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "our analysis shows that a collective flow develops at each @xmath0 which increases further with the increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the description of the rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra of hadrons at each @xmath0 matches very well with the experimental data .",
    "thus , we emphasize that thermal models are indeed an important tool to describe the various features of hot and dense hg . although , these models are not capable of telling whether qgp was formed before hg phase but can give an indirect indication of it by showing any anomalous feature as observed in the experimental data .    in conclusion , the net outcome of this review is indeed a surprising one .",
    "the excluded - volume hg models are really successfull in describing all kinds of features of the hg formed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . most important",
    "property indicated by such description is the chemical equilibrium reached in such collisions .",
    "however , the description is still a geometrical one and does not involve any microscopic picture of interactions .",
    "moreover , it s relativistic and field theoretic generalizations are still needed in order to make the picture a more realistic description .",
    "but it is amazing to find that these models still work much better than expected .",
    "notwithstanding these remarks , we should add that lattice qcd results are now available for the pressure , entropy density and energy density etc .",
    "for the entire temperature range from @xmath358 to higher values at @xmath359",
    ". here low temperature phase of qcd is the hg and recently our excluded - volume model reproduces these properties quite in agreement with lattice results @xcite .",
    "we have also used these calculations in the precise determination of the qcd critical end point @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that the excluded - volume models are successfull in reproducing numerical results obtained in various experiments and , therefore , further research is required to show how these descriptions are connected with the microscopic interactions .",
