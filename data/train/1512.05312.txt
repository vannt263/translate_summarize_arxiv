    "to conclude , we have presented the microscopic theory of the electron structure and the zeeman effect for helical edge states emerging in two - dimensional topological insulators based on hgte / hgcdte quantum wells .",

    "the interface inversion asymmetry leads to the mixing of the electron - like and heavy - hole subbands forming the helical edge states .",
    "the subband mixing , described by a single parameter @xmath36 , modifies the edge - state dispersion and leads to spatial oscillations of the edge - state wave functions with the wave length controlled by @xmath36 .",
    "external magnetic field applied to the quantum well structure destroys the topological protection of the helical states and opens the gap in the edge - state spectrum .",

    "weak magnetic field normal to the quantum well plane couples the counter propagating edge states and opens the gap in the edge - state spectrum due to the subband mixing , whereas strong normal magnetic field drives the system into the phase of the quantum hall effect with the formation of chiral electron and hole edge states .",
