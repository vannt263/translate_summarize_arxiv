    "a lepton - jet is an object that consists of a group of boosted and collimated leptons .",
    "it is a unique signature for the leptonic decay of a fast moving light particle in the mass range below about 1 gev @xcite , where it was discussed in the context of light gauge bosons from the dark sector .    in these dark - sector models ,",
    "the higgs boson can be connected the dark sector via higgs - portal type interaction : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the standard model ( sm ) higgs field and @xmath7 is the scalar field in the hidden sector . when both the higgs field and @xmath7 develop vacuum expectation values , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mix to form mass eigenstates , and the higgs boson can decay into a pair of the scalar bosons if kinematically allowed . in some models , the dark sector can also be connected with the sm particles via @xmath8 mixing . in either scenarios ,",
    "when the hidden gauge bosons or scalar bosons are very light , say below 1 gev , they will decay into the heaviest sm particles if kinematically allowed .",
    "for example , a 500 mev scalar boson decays , via the mixing with the sm higgs boson , can decay into a pair of muons , pions , electrons , or photons .",
    "the dominant modes would be pions and muons . in some other scenarios when there is a broken @xmath9 global symmetry in the hidden sector , the scalar boson can also decay into a pair of goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "a uv complete model , which can have one light pseudoscalar resonance ( @xmath10 ) decaying into a pair of muons , is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "both the dark - sector models and the nmssm have been frequently explored in the lhc experiments : atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the search for lepton - jets from the decay of very light particles so as to identify the existence of hidden sectors that are connected to the sm via the higgs - portal . for simplicity",
    "we only consider the hidden - sector models that contain either a real sm - singlet scalar field @xmath11 or two real sm - singlet scalar fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 , without imposing any extra symmetries .",
    "the dominant decay modes of the scalar boson of @xmath1(1 gev ) would then be pions and muons .",
    "it is the muons in the decay products of a fast - moving light scalar boson that form a lepton - jet , for which we are searching for in experiments as a signature of the existence of very light scalar bosons .",
    "such a light scalar boson , which originates from the mixing with the sm higgs boson , can appear in the decay of the higgs boson .",
    "since the constraints on the mixing for such a light scalar boson with the sm higgs boson are very strong , which we will show , the very light scalar boson might be a long - lived neutral particle and so we might observe a displaced decay vertex in detectors .",
    "we are therefore interested in rare decays of the higgs boson into a pair of very light scalar bosons of mass about @xmath1(1 gev ) , each of which in turns directly decays into a pair of collimated muons or in a cascade decay into another pair of light scalar bosons , then each of them decays into a pair of collimated muons .",
    "let us denote a muon - jet with @xmath14 collimated muons in it by @xmath15-jet , e.g. , a @xmath2-jet is a muon - jet with 2 muons and a @xmath4-jet is a muon - jet with 4 muons .",
    "thus , the final states can consist of three different types of combinations : + ( 1 ) two @xmath2-jets back - to - back in the transverse plane ; + ( 2 ) one @xmath2-jet on one side and one @xmath4-jet on the other side ; + ( 3 ) two @xmath4-jets on opposite sides of the transverse plane .    the model can be made further complicated by invoking additional light scalar bosons or gauge bosons in the hidden sector such that the decay chain can involve more hidden sector particles . at the end , each lepton - jet can consist of more than four leptons , like 6 , 8 , or more",
    ". these lepton - jets would be very interesting objects to search for in experiments because they are clear signals of new physics . the experimental resolution to tell the number of leptons in a lepton - jet becomes an important issue .",
    "here we only consider two simple cases of two muons inside a muon - jet and four muons inside a `` fat '' muon - jet .",
    "we also compare these two cases to distinguish between whether the final state muon - jet is produced from direct decay of a light scalar boson or in a cascade decay .",
    "the organization is as follows .",
    "we describe two simple higgs - portal models in the next section , and in sec .",
    "iii the existing constraints on these two models .",
    "these constraints are quite generic on many models of this kind .",
    "we consider some kinematical distributions at the lhc for some benchmark points in sec .",
    "iv and highlight the potential search at lhc-14 with 300 @xmath16 in sec .",
    "v. finally , we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "here we employ a higgs portal model in which the sm higgs field @xmath6 can mix with a real scalar field @xmath11 .",
    "this additional scalar field does not have any sm interactions .",
    "we also impose a @xmath18 symmetry which @xmath6 is @xmath19 and @xmath11 is @xmath20 before both the higgs field and @xmath11 develop vacuum expectation values .",
    "the renormalizable lagrangian density for this model is given by @xmath21 where the higgs sector in the @xmath22 is @xmath23 after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , the sm higgs doublet field @xmath6 is expanded around its vacuum - expectation value : @xmath24 where @xmath25 gev .",
    "the @xmath11 is also expanded around its vacuum - expectation value @xmath26 : @xmath27 two tadpole conditions can be written down using @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the scalar potential part of eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) : @xmath31 @xmath32 taking the decoupling limit @xmath33 from the above equations , we recover the sm condition of @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to see that the higgs boson field @xmath36 will mix with the new scalar field @xmath37 to form mass eigenstates denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the mass terms for the higgs boson and the new scalar boson are @xmath40 we can rotate @xmath41 through an angle @xmath42 @xmath43 thus , the masses of the higgs boson @xmath38 and the scalar boson @xmath39 , the mixing angle @xmath42 , and the interaction governing @xmath44 are given by , in terms of the parameters in eq .",

    ", the above relations are reduced to @xmath46    the scalar boson @xmath39 can decay into sm particles via the mixing with the higgs boson .",

    "gev is @xmath51 mode , we still focus on the analysis of @xmath52 mode .",
    "since the resolution of muons are better than pions and the analysis of @xmath51 mode has been researched in ref.@xcite . ] here @xmath51 includes both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . since the tree - level estimate of @xmath56 is not adequate when @xmath57 is not far from the pion threshold , where the strong final - state interaction becomes important @xcite , so we follow ref .",

    "4 .   in this work we just investigated the signatures of @xmath2-jets and @xmath4-jets for three different final - state event topologies . however , if we take into account the three - body decay of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , then we will have more different final - state event topologies , including @xmath102-jets , which can enrich the analysis but are seriously suppressed by the phase space",
    "our simple models are quite generic for any more complicated models , which include either one or more very light scalar bosons mixing with the sm higgs boson .",
    "there are at least one long - lived neutral particle(s ) in this kind of models , which are still testable below 1 gev for both the atlas and cms as shown in fig .",

    "<S> a muon - jet ( @xmath0-jet ) is a very special feature that consists of a cluster of collimated muons from the decay of a fast moving light particle of mass about @xmath1(1 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will use this feature to search for very light particles from rare decays of the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> for such a small angular separation of muons , the key detector components to separate collimated tracks are the pixel / sct and the muon spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> we use two simple models of the higgs - portal type to explore the possibilities of event topologies with two @xmath2-jets , one @xmath2-jet @xmath3 one @xmath4-jet , and two @xmath4-jets in the final state at lhc-14 . </S>",
    "<S> we also summarize existing constraints on these models . </S>"
