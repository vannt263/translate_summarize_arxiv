    "topological open strings and topological d - branes have recently been enjoying the attention of both physicists and mathematicians .",
    "the most obvious physical motivation for studying topological string theory is that it is a toy - model for `` physical '' string theory .",
    "thus a better understanding of topological d - branes could shed light on the general definition of a boundary condition for a two - dimensional conformal field theory ( 2d cft ) , something which is not known at present .",
    "further , if a 2d topological field theory ( 2d tft ) is obtained by twisting a 2d supersymmetric field theory , then it is possible to regard topological d - branes as a special class of `` physical '' d - branes ( bps d - branes ) .",
    "in fact , much of recent progress in string theory has resulted from studying bps d - branes .    from the mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "topological string theory is an alternative way of describing certain important geometric categories , such as the category of coherent sheaves on a calabi - yau manifold , and can serve as a powerful source of intuition .",
    "an outstanding example of such intuition is the homological mirror symmetry conjecture  @xcite .",
    "most works on topological string theory considered the case of topologically twisted @xmath0 sigma - models  @xcite with a calabi - yau target space .",
    "this is the case when the world - sheet theory is conformal , and topological correlators can also be interpreted in terms of a physical string theory  @xcite .",
    "however , one can also consider more general topologically twisted @xmath0 field theories and the corresponding d - branes .",
    "one class of such theories is given by sigma - models whose target is a fano variety ( say , a complex projective space , or a complex grassmannian ) .",
    "such qfts , although conformally - invariant on the classical level , have non - trivial renormalization - group flow once quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "another set of examples is provided by @xmath0 landau - ginzburg models ( lg models )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in many cases these two classes of @xmath0 theories are related by mirror symmetry  @xcite .",
    "for example , the sigma - model with target @xmath1 is mirror to a landau - ginzburg model with @xmath2 fields @xmath3 taking values in @xmath4 , and a superpotential @xmath5 thus if one wants to extend the homological mirror symmetry conjecture to the non - calabi - yau case , one needs to understand d - branes in topologically twisted lg models .",
    "note that all critical points of this superpotential are isolated and non - degenerate ; this means that all the vacua have a mass gap , and the infrared limit of this lg model is trivial . in what follows we will call such lg models _",
    "massive_. despite the triviality of the infrared limit , the homological mirror symmetry conjecture remains meaningful and non - trivial in this case .",
    "very recently it has been proposed that massive @xmath0 @xmath6 qfts can be used to describe certain non - standard superstring backgrounds with ramond - ramond flux  @xcite .",
    "thus a study of d - branes in massive qfts could be useful for understanding open strings in such ramond - ramond backgrounds .    in order to formulate our problem more concretely , let us first summarize the situation in the calabi - yau case , where the @xmath0 field theory is conformal .",
    "@xmath0 superconformal field theories have two topologically twisted versions : a - model and b - model  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding d - branes are called a - branes and b - branes .",
    "mirror symmetry exchanges a - branes and b - branes .",
    "tree - level topological correlators give the set of either a - branes or b - branes the structure of an @xmath7-category ; gauge - invariant information is encoded by the corresponding derived categories .",
    "it has been argued that the derived category of b - branes is equivalent to the derived category of coherent sheaves  @xcite .",
    "a detailed check of this proposal has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for a - branes on calabi - yau manifolds , it has been proposed that the relevant @xmath7-category is the so - called fukaya category , whose objects are ( roughly ) lagrangian submanifolds carrying vector bundles with flat connections  @xcite . recently it has been shown that the derived fukaya category is too small and does not accommodate certain physically acceptable a - branes  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if we want the homological mirror symmetry conjecture to be true for tori , then the fukaya category must be enlarged with non - lagrangian ( more specifically , coisotropic ) branes .    in the case of fano varieties ,",
    "the sigma - model is not conformal .",
    "what is more important , the axial @xmath8 r - current is anomalous , and therefore one can not define the b - twist  @xcite .",
    "one _ can _ consider d - branes which preserve b - type supersymmetry , but the relation with the derived category of coherent sheaves is less straightforward  @xcite .",
    "mirror symmetry relates b - branes on fano varieties with a - branes in lg models .",
    "the latter have been studied from a variety of viewpoints in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the case",
    "when the fano variety is @xmath1 , the prediction of mirror symmetry has been tested in ref .",
    "in particular , the mirrors of `` exceptional '' bundles on @xmath1 have been identified , and in the case of @xmath9 and @xmath10 it has been checked that morphisms between these bundles in the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath1 agree with the floer homology between their mirror a - branes .",
    "one can also consider the category of a - branes on a fano manifold . since the vector @xmath8 r - current is not anomalous ,",
    "the a - twist is well - defined , and a - branes can be regarded as topological boundary conditions for the a - model .",
    "presumably , the category of a - branes contains the derived fukaya category as a subcategory , but other than that little is known about it , even in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "if we assume mirror symmetry , we can learn about the category of a - branes on @xmath1 by studying b - branes in the mirror lg model .",
    "the b - twist is well - defined for any lg model whose target has a trivial canonical bundle , thus b - branes in such a lg model can be regarded as topological boundary conditions for the b - model .",
    "an obvious question is how the introduction of the superpotential deforms the relation between the category of b - branes and the derived category of coherent sheaves .",
    "important steps towards understanding b - branes in lg models have been taken in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a related work ) . in these papers",
    "general properties of b - branes have been studied , and several concrete examples have been discussed .",
    "a somewhat surprising lesson from these works is that the category of b - branes remains non - trivial even in a massive lg model , where the bulk 2d tft is trivial .",
    "for example , if we take the superpotential @xmath11 to be a non - degenerate quadratic function on @xmath12 , the graded algebra of endomorphisms of a d0-brane sitting at the critical point of @xmath11 is isomorphic to a clifford algebra with @xmath2 generators  @xcite .",
    "this raises the question if one can determine the category of b - branes in any massive lg model .    a proposal which accomplishes",
    "this has been put forward by m.  kontsevich .",
    "roughly speaking , the proposal is that the superpotential @xmath11 deforms the derived category of coherent sheaves by replacing complexes of locally free sheaves with `` twisted '' complexes . here",
    "`` twisted '' means that compositions of successive morphisms in a complex are equal to @xmath11 , instead of zero .",
    "one also needs to switch from @xmath13-graded complexes to @xmath14-graded ones .",
    "kontsevich s proposal is supposed to describe b - branes in any lg model such that the critical set of @xmath11 is compact ; in particular , it does not require the critical points of @xmath11 to be non - degenerate .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide evidence for kontsevich s proposal .",
    "our evidence is of two kinds .",
    "first , we argue on physical grounds that twisted complexes arise as a consequence of brst - invariance . more precisely , while in the presence of the superpotential a holomorphic vector bundle or a complex of vector bundles",
    "does not correspond to a b - type boundary condition , we show that any twisted complex of holomorphic vector bundles is a valid b - brane .",
    "second , we test the proposal in some specific cases where morphisms between branes ( i.e. spectra of topological open strings ) can be easily computed .",
    "we focus on the massive case , where the proposal simplifies considerably .",
    "namely , the category of @xmath14-graded twisted complexes can be related to the sum of several copies of the category of finite - dimensional @xmath14-graded modules over a clifford algebra .",
    "we will denote the latter category @xmath15 in what follows .",
    "this reformulation is helpful , because the functor from the category of b - branes in a massive lg model to @xmath15 is very simple to describe . in this paper",
    "we perform some checks that this functor is an embedding of graded categories . in view of the above - mentioned `` duality '' between @xmath14-graded twisted complexes and @xmath15 , this provides a test of kontsevich s proposal .",
    "assuming the validity of the proposal , we infer that the category of b - branes in an arbitrary massive lg model is a full sub - category of @xmath15 .",
    "the latter has a very simple and explicit description .",
    "since for many fano varieties the mirror lg model is known , our results allow one to effectively compute the category of a - branes for such varieties . from the mathematical viewpoint",
    ", it is an interesting challenge to reproduce such results using methods of symplectic geometry .",
    "axiomatic definitions of topological d - branes for 2d topological field theories ( 2d tfts ) have been recently proposed by g.  moore and g.  segal  @xcite and c.  i.  lazaroiu  @xcite .",
    "one of the main unresolved problems in the axiomatic approach is whether these axioms determine unambiguously the category of topological d - branes associated to a given tft .",
    "we show that the category of b - branes for a massive lg model with a quadratic superpotential provides a counter - example to uniqueness .",
    "in fact , this example shows that uniqueness , if understood naively , fails also for ordinary ( i.e. non - topological ) d - branes in any closed superstring background .",
    "however , this particular failure is rather mild , i.e. it does not seem to have serious physical consequences .",
    "now let us describe the content of the paper in more detail . in section  [ sec :",
    "a ] we recall some basic facts about mirror symmetry between fano varieties and lg models . in section  [ sec : b ] we review general properties of b - branes in lg models .",
    "we argue that if the superpotential has only isolated critical points , then it is sufficient to study b - branes in the infinitesimal neighborhood of each critical point .",
    "for example , if all critical points of @xmath11 are non - degenerate , one does not lose anything if one replaces the superpotential by its quadratic approximation near each critical point .",
    "the material in this section is not new and has been previously discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in sections",
    "[ sec : c ] and [ sec : cp ] we study b - branes in the lg model with the superpotential @xmath16 this is the simplest lg model where b - branes of dimension larger than @xmath17 are present . in section",
    "[ sec : d ] we discuss b - branes in more general lg models with the superpotential @xmath18 in section  [ sec : e ] we explain kontsevich s proposal and show that our results are consistent with it .",
    "we also explain why brst invariance of boundary conditions requires twisted complexes of vector bundles instead of ordinary complexes .",
    "this provides a physical explanation of kontsevich s proposal .",
    "we also relate b - branes in massive lg models to @xmath14-graded clifford modules . in section  [ sec : f ] we use homological mirror symmetry to compute the category of a - branes for @xmath10 and @xmath19 .",
    "section  [ sec : g ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "a fano variety is a compact complex manifold whose anti - canonical line bundle is ample .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the first chern class of the canonical line bundle is negative - definite .",
    "an @xmath0 sigma - model whose target space is a fano variety describes an @xmath0 @xmath6 field theory which is free in the ultraviolet . in the infrared",
    ", it can either flow to a massive vacuum , or to a non - trivial @xmath0 scft .",
    "note that classically @xmath0 sigma - models have both vector and axial @xmath8 r - symmetries , but for fano varieties quantum anomalies break the axial r - symmetry down to a discrete subgroup .",
    "generically , this subgroup is @xmath14 , but in special cases it can be larger . in the calabi - yau case",
    "the full axial r - symmetry is non - anomalous , and it is this fact that makes calabi - yau target spaces so special .",
    "the simplest examples of fano varieties are complex projective spaces @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 field theories are well studied ; in fact , these models are integrable , in the sense that the exact s - matrix is known  @xcite .",
    "these theories have only massive vacua . a more general set of examples is given by grassmann varieties @xmath20 , which are defined as spaces of complex @xmath21-planes in an @xmath2-dimensional complex vector space .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 field theories are also integrable  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0 field theory which has a conserved vector ( resp .",
    "axial ) r - current admits a topological a - twist ( resp .",
    "b - twist ) , which yields a 2d topological field theory called the a - model ( resp .",
    "b - model ) .",
    "@xmath0 superconformal field theories have both axial and vector r - symmetries , and therefore admit both kinds of twisting .",
    "a - branes and b - branes are `` defined '' as boundary conditions which are consistent with a - twist and b - twist , respectively .",
    "these two sets of branes have the structure of a category .",
    "the space of morphisms is defined as the state space of topological open strings stretched between pairs of branes .",
    "composition of morphisms is defined by means of 3-point correlators in topological open string theory .",
    "since state spaces of open strings are graded vector spaces , brane categories are graded categories . in the case of a - branes",
    ", spaces of morphisms are graded by the axial r - charge ; in the case of b - branes , by the vector r - charge . for fano varieties , the axial r - symmetry is generically @xmath14 , so spaces of morphisms in the category of a - branes are @xmath14-graded vector spaces . in the calabi - yau case ,",
    "the full axial @xmath8 r - symmetry is non - anomalous , and therefore the category of a - branes is @xmath13-graded .",
    "this is the reason one has to work with @xmath13-graded lagrangian submanifolds in the calabi - yau case  @xcite . in the fano case ,",
    "one only needs to require that lagrangian submanifolds be oriented .    in the calabi - yau case",
    ", we can also consider the category of b - branes . since the vector r - current is non - anomalous , this category is @xmath13-graded . in the fano case ,",
    "the b - twist is not defined , and there is no obvious way to define the category of b - branes .",
    "given a graded category , one can enlarge it by adding for any object @xmath22 its shifts @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 or @xmath25 , and defining morphisms as follows : @xmath26,y_2[j]\\right)=mor^{k+j - i}(y_1,y_2).\\ ] ] in string theory , the r - charge of strings connecting two different branes is defined only up to an integer constant ; changing this constant by @xmath21 shifts the degree of all morphisms by @xmath21 .",
    "the effect of this arbitrariness is that for any brane @xmath22 its shifts @xmath23 $ ] are automatically included .",
    "this implies that no information is lost if we replace groups of morphisms with their degree-0 components .",
    "this is what one usually does when working with categories of complexes , such as the derived category .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will keep morphisms of all degrees , since this conforms better to physical conventions . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the mathematical counterpart of the category of b - branes on a calabi - yau @xmath27 is not @xmath28 , but a @xmath13-graded category which is called the completion of @xmath28 with respect to the shift functor .    for a sigma - model on a calabi - yau manifold which is a complete intersection in a toric variety ,",
    "the mirror theory is again a sigma - model of the same kind . for fano varieties which are complete intersections in a toric variety ,",
    "the mirror theory is a lg model whose target is a non - compact calabi - yau  @xcite .",
    "a general definition of a lg model involves , besides a choice of a target manifold , a choice of a holomorphic function @xmath11 on this manifold ( the superpotential ) .",
    "thus non - trivial lg models require non - compact target spaces .",
    "this non - compactness usually does not cause trouble : the important thing is for the critical set of @xmath11 to be compact . in general , superpotential breaks vector r - symmetry down to @xmath14 .",
    "thus the a - twist is not defined , in general . on the other hand , since the canonical bundle of the target manifold is trivial , the axial r - symmetry is not anomalous , and the b - twist is well - defined .",
    "we expect that the category of a - branes on a fano variety is equivalent to the category of b - branes on the mirror lg model .    for example",
    ", the mirror of @xmath1 is a lg model whose target is @xmath29 with the superpotential eq .",
    "( [ wcpn ] ) .",
    "this superpotential has @xmath30 non - degenerate critical points given by @xmath31 the physical interpretation is that the theory has @xmath30 massive vacua .",
    "this agrees with the count of vacua in the @xmath1 model .",
    "furthermore , the superpotential breaks vector @xmath32 symmetry down to @xmath14 given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the usual odd coordinates on the chiral @xmath35 superspace . as a consequence",
    ", spaces of morphisms in the category of b - branes in this lg model are @xmath14-graded .",
    "this is mirror to the fact that morphisms in the category of a - branes on @xmath1 are @xmath14-graded .",
    "r - symmetry ; the @xmath14 symmetry discussed in the text is its subgroup .",
    "this is mirror to the fact that the @xmath1 sigma - model has non - anomalous axial @xmath36 r - symmetry . in this paper",
    "we will only keep track of @xmath14-gradings . ]    as a rule , it is easier to understand b - branes , rather than a - branes .",
    "therefore , we now turn to the study of b - branes in lg models , in the hope that it will illuminate the properties of a - branes on fano varieties .",
    "the classical geometry of b - branes was described in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .  @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we summarize the results of refs .",
    "@xcite which are relevant for us and discuss some simple consequences .",
    "let @xmath27 be the target space of a lg model . on general grounds ,",
    "it must be khler manifold ( possibly non - compact ) .",
    "let the @xmath11 be a fixed holomorphic function on @xmath27 ( the superpotential ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be a submanifold of @xmath27 , and let @xmath37 be a hermitian vector bundle over @xmath22 with a unitary connection @xmath38 .",
    "the rank of @xmath37 will be called the multiplicity of the corresponding d - brane .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the triple @xmath39 defines a classical b - type boundary condition if and only if @xmath22 is a complex submanifold of @xmath27 , @xmath11 is constant on @xmath22 , and the pair @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the anti - holomorphic part of @xmath38 , is a holomorphic vector bundle .",
    "for example , a point on @xmath27 together with a choice of multiplicity @xmath42 defines a b - type boundary condition .",
    "the class of b - branes described in the previous paragraph does not exhaust all possible b - branes .",
    "but it appears plausible that all b - branes can be obtained as bound states of the branes described above .",
    "it was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) that most of the `` classical '' b - branes should be regarded as zero objects in the category of b - branes .",
    "a classical b - brane is isomorphic to the zero object if and only if the space of its endomorphisms is zero - dimensional , i.e. when there are no supersymmetric open string states connecting the brane with itself . in this case",
    "one says that world - sheet supersymmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "for example , it is explained in refs .",
    "@xcite that if @xmath22 is a point on @xmath27 which is not a critical point of @xmath11 , then b - type supersymmetry is spontaneously broken , and therefore @xmath22 is isomorphic to the zero object in the category of b - branes .",
    "this phenomenon reduces enormously the number of b - branes that one needs to consider , and makes it plausible that the whole category can be described combinatorially , using only the number and type of critical points of @xmath11 . to substantiate this claim",
    ", we first notice that to any b - brane in the class described above one can assign a complex number , the value of @xmath11 on this brane .",
    "further , there are no non - zero morphisms between branes with different values of @xmath11 , because any string connecting such branes will have non - zero energy and will not be supersymmetric  @xcite .",
    "( unlike in the case of a - branes , there is no central charge in the supersymmetry algebra , and supersymmetric states must have zero energy . )",
    "thus the category of b - branes can be regarded as a family of categories parametrized by @xmath43 , and the categories at different points in @xmath43 do not `` talk '' to each other .",
    "second , zero - energy classical configurations of an open string must be constant maps from the interval to @xmath22 , such that the potential energy @xmath44 vanishes .",
    "this implies that unless a b - brane passes through a critical point of @xmath11 , there are no supersymmetric states for strings connecting this b - brane to any other b - brane ( including itself ) .",
    "it follows that categories corresponding to non - critical values of @xmath11 are trivial ( contain only the zero object ) .",
    "now let us assume that all critical points of @xmath11 are isolated . by scaling up the khler form",
    ", we can make the semi - classical approximation arbitrarily good .",
    "this means that wave - functions of all string states will be arbitrarily well localized near a particular critical point of @xmath11 , and the overlap between wave - functions associated to different critical points will be arbitrarily small . since topological correlators do not depend on the khler form , it is clear that morphisms between b - branes can be computed using only the leading terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath11 around the critical points .. ]    to be more precise , we can attach a category to each isolated critical point of @xmath11 as follows : we replace @xmath11 by a polynomial which has the same singularity , and consider the category of b - branes on an affine space with this polynomial superpotential .",
    "now let us form the direct sum of such categories over all critical points of @xmath11 and call it @xmath45 .",
    "there is an obvious map which associates to any b - brane an object of @xmath15 .",
    "invariance of topological correlators under variations of the khler form means that this map extends to a functor , and this functor is full and faithful . in other words ,",
    "the category of b - branes is a full sub - category of @xmath15 .    in particular , when all critical points of @xmath11 are non - degenerate ( i.e. when all vacua are massive ) , the problem reduces to understanding b - branes in the lg model with target @xmath12 and superpotential @xmath46 the corresponding bulk theory is free , but since the boundary conditions need not be linear , the problem of determining all b - branes is far from trivial . in this paper",
    "we will study b - branes which correspond to linear boundary conditions .",
    "some such branes have been considered in refs .",
    "we will see below that if kontsevich s conjecture is true , then these branes generate the whole category of b - branes .    note that the lg superpotential eq .",
    "( [ wcpn ] ) satisfies the conditions stated above .",
    "thus , assuming mirror symmetry , we can gain information about a - branes on @xmath1 by studying b - branes in the free lg model with the superpotential eq .",
    "( [ wfreen ] ) . in the case @xmath47",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in that case the category of a - branes is independently known , and one can see that the mirror conjecture holds true . in section  [ sec :",
    "f ] we discuss the less trivial case @xmath48 .    before continuing ,",
    "let us make some further comments on the relation between @xmath15 and the category of b - branes .",
    "we do not claim that the two categories are equivalent , only that the latter is a full sub - category of the former .",
    "this means that each b - brane can be regarded as a direct sum of `` local '' b - branes attached to critical points , but not every direct sum is a valid b - brane .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : f ] some examples where the category of b - branes is strictly smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless , since each b - brane behaves as a composite of `` local '' b - branes , it is reasonable to enlarge the category of b - branes by allowing arbitrary sums of `` local '' b - branes .",
    "then the category of b - branes becomes equivalent to @xmath15 . from a purely algebraic standpoint ,",
    "this is a very natural procedure ( c.f . a discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite concerning reducible and irreducible branes ) , but the drawback is that the new branes lack a clear geometric interpretation .",
    "section  [ sec : f ] contains a further discussion of this issue .",
    "we begin by recalling the results of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning b - branes in the simplest lg model with the superpotential @xmath50 . in this case , the only allowed b - branes are d0-branes located at @xmath51 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the space of endomorphisms of a single d0-brane is two - dimensional , with one - dimensional even subspace and one - dimensional odd subspace . as a graded algebra , it is generated over @xmath43 by the identity and an odd element @xmath52 with the relation @xmath53 this is a clifford algebra @xmath54 .",
    "if we take @xmath55 d0-branes , then the algebra of endomorphisms becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the algebra of @xmath58 complex matrices .",
    "we are interested in the next simplest lg model with the superpotential @xmath49 .",
    "again , d0-branes must be localized at @xmath59 , and it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the algebra of endomorphisms of a single d0-brane is generated by two odd elements @xmath60 with the relations @xmath61 this is a clifford algebra @xmath62 .",
    "more invariantly , if we denote by @xmath63 the complex vector space which is the target space of our lg model , we can say that fermion zero modes for the open string take values in @xmath63 .",
    "the hessian of the superpotential @xmath64 defines a non - degenerate symmetric bilinear form on @xmath63 , and the endomorphism algebra of the d0-brane is the clifford algebra associated to the pair @xmath65 .",

    "the reason for such a convention will be explained in the next section .",
    "the fact that for even @xmath2 there are no fermionic zero modes for open strings connecting two maximal isotropic subspaces implies that the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude is non - zero in this sector .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the composition of non - zero morphisms between two maximal b - branes is a non - zero multiple of the identity endomorphism .",
    "if these two b - branes are in the same irreducible family , this means that they represent isomorphic objects in the category ; if they are in different irreducible families , then the interpretation is that they are isomorphic up to a shift .",

    "it is easy to see that the morphism corresponding to the identity element of @xmath54 is invertible , and therefore any two maximal b - branes are isomorphic .",
    "our third example is the case @xmath266 , that is , the case of the d0-brane .",

    "let us recall how to define the derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth affine variety @xmath27 following ref .",

    "we define @xmath276 to be a category whose objects are bounded @xmath13-graded complexes of projective objects of @xmath274 .",
    "equivalently , we can think about the coordinate ring of @xmath27 as a differential graded algebra ( dg - algebra ) which is concentrated in degree zero and has a trivial differential ; then objects of @xmath276 are differential graded modules ( dg - modules ) over this dg - algebra such that all homogeneous components are projective @xmath275-modules , and all but a finite number of homogeneous components are trivial .",
    "morphisms in @xmath276 are morphisms of these dg - modules regarded simply as @xmath275-modules ( i.e. morphisms do not necessarily preserve the grading or respect the differentials ) .",
    "groups of morphisms in the category @xmath276 are naturally @xmath13-graded and have a natural differential of degree @xmath277 .",
    "for example , closed morphisms of degree 0 in the category @xmath276 are ordinary morphisms of complexes ( the ones which preserve the grading and commute with the differentials ) , while exact morphisms of degree 0 are morphisms of complexes which are homotopic to zero .",
    "thus @xmath276 is a dg - category .",
    "there is a general way to make a triangulated category out of any dg - category  @xcite .",
    "one takes the category of `` twisted objects '' of the dg - category , which is again a dg - category , and then passes to degree-0 homology , i.e. replaces groups of morphisms with their degree-0 homology . in the present case ,",
    "since we are working with complexes of projective modules , it is not necessary to consider twisted objects , and one can simply apply the functor @xmath278 to @xmath276 .",
    "the resulting triangulated category is simply the homotopy category of bounded complexes of projective @xmath275 modules , and it is well known that it is equivalent to the bounded derived category of @xmath274 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "alternatively , one can apply to @xmath276 the functor @xmath279 .",
    "this gives a graded category which is the completion of @xmath28 with respect to the shift functor .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : a ] , the latter alternative conforms better to physical conventions .",
    "now we can formulate kontsevich s proposal rather simply .",
    "let @xmath27 be a smooth affine variety , and @xmath11 be a holomorphic function on @xmath27 ( the superpotential ) , whose critical set is compact .",
    "let @xmath280 be a critical value of @xmath11 .",
    "first , since in the presence of the superpotential morphisms between b - branes are @xmath14-graded , we will have to use @xmath14-graded complexes in order to construct the analogue of @xmath276 .",
    "second , we deform our @xmath14-graded complexes of projective modules by asking that the composition of two successive morphisms be equal to @xmath281 , instead of zero .",
    "thus objects of the deformed category @xmath282 are pairs of finitely generated projective @xmath275-modules @xmath283 and morphisms @xmath284 and @xmath285 such that @xmath286 we can regard the pair @xmath287 as a @xmath14-graded @xmath275-module , and @xmath288 as an odd endomorphism @xmath289 of this module whose square is @xmath281 ( `` twisted differential '' ) .",
    "morphisms in this category are defined as ( ungraded ) morphisms of the corresponding @xmath275-modules .",
    "they have a natural @xmath14-grading , and a natural differential .",
    "the differential on @xmath290 is defined as @xmath291 here @xmath292 acts as @xmath277 on the even component and as @xmath293 on the odd component .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath294 is an odd operator whose square is zero .",

    "applying to @xmath282 the functor @xmath279 , we obtain a graded category , which is proposed to be equivalent to the category of b - branes corresponding to the critical value @xmath295 .",
    "one can show that all spaces of morphisms in this category are finite - dimensional , provided the critical set of @xmath11 is compact .",
    "an unsatisfactory feature of this construction is that one needs to use complexes of projective modules , instead of general complexes .",
    "this causes problems if one tries to extend the definition from affine varieties to algebraic ones .",
    "there is a way to repair this defect  @xcite , but we will not try to explain this more complicated definition in this paper .      in this subsection",
    "we give a physical argument supporting the identification of b - branes with objects of the category @xmath282 .",
    "our argument is modelled on those in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was explained why complexes of locally free sheaves on a calabi - yau manifold can be thought of as b - branes . for our purposes , it is sufficient to consider @xmath14-graded complexes",
    ". then the argument of refs .",
    "@xcite can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider a pair of locally free sheaves ( i.e. holomorphic vector bundles ) @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",

    "now we can deform the boundary condition corresponding to @xmath299 $ ] by adding a boundary term to the action which depends on a pair of sections @xmath300 and @xmath301 ( the `` tachyons '' ) . in order to preserve brst invariance",
    ", one has to require that @xmath302 and @xmath303 be holomorphic , and @xmath304 , @xmath305 .",
    "this deformed boundary condition corresponds to a @xmath14-graded complex @xmath306 one expects ( although there is no iron - clad argument ) that any b - brane is isomorphic to a b - brane of this kind .",
    "this provides a physical explanation for the relation between complexes of locally free sheaves on a calabi - yau and b - branes .    in the case of a lg model ,",
    "locally free coherent sheaves on @xmath27 are not valid b - branes , because their support is the whole @xmath27 , and @xmath11 is not constant on @xmath27 .",
    "technically , the problem occurs because the brst variation of the bulk action contains a non - vanishing @xmath11-dependent term which is a total derivative on the world - sheet .",
    "this is the so - called warner problem  @xcite .",
    "the sum @xmath299 $ ] is not a b - brane either .",
    "however , we can try to add a boundary term to the action of the sigma - model so that brst invariance is restored .",
    "we take the same term as in the case @xmath66 . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have two holomorphic sections @xmath302 and @xmath303 to play with .",
    "as we show below , the condition of brst - invariance is modified to @xmath307 , @xmath308 , where @xmath295 is a constant .",
    "this shows that any object of @xmath282 corresponds to a b - brane .",
    "now let us work out the brst - invariance conditions and show that @xmath302 and @xmath303 must satisfy the constraints stated above .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume at first that both @xmath296 and @xmath297 are line bundles .",
    "the boundary lagrangian is taken to be @xmath309 here @xmath310 is a complex fermion living on the boundary , @xmath311 is the restriction of a bulk fermionic field to the boundary , and @xmath312 are holomorphic sections of @xmath313 and @xmath314 , respectively .",
    "they depend on the fields @xmath315 restricted to the boundary .",
    "the fermion @xmath310 takes values in @xmath314 , and the covariant derivative @xmath316 along the boundary makes use of the unitary connections on @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "the boundary lagrangian is manifestly gauge - invariant .",
    "if we set @xmath317 , we get the usual path - integral representation of the parallel transport operator in the bundle @xmath318  @xcite . for non - zero @xmath302 or @xmath303",
    "we get a deformation of the usual boundary condition . in the special case",
    "@xmath319 we get the boundary lagrangian used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we postulate the following supersymmetry transformations for @xmath310 : @xmath320 here @xmath321 and @xmath322 are regarded as independent complex grassmann variables .",
    "we also note that @xmath302 and @xmath303 transform as follows : @xmath323 brst transformations are obtained by setting @xmath324 .",
    "one can check that the brst variation of the boundary lagrangian is given , up to a total derivative , by @xmath325 on the other hand , the brst variation of the bulk action is a boundary term given by @xmath326.{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two terms in the bulk variation are standard and vanish when the standard neumann boundary conditions are imposed on @xmath315 and @xmath327 .",
    "the last term is the warner term  @xcite . obviously , in order for the variation of the boundary lagrangian to cancel the warner term , we need to require @xmath328 one can get rid of the factor @xmath190 by redefining @xmath329 .",
    "this implies that instead of an ordinary complex of holomorphic vector bundles we are dealing with an object of @xmath330    it is straightforward to generalize the construction to the higher - rank case .",
    "the fermion @xmath310 still takes values in @xmath314 , which means that it is a matrix of size @xmath331 . in order for the path - integral over @xmath332 to reproduce a path - ordered exponential in the representation of the gauge group of dimension @xmath333",
    ", one needs to insert a projector onto the sector where the total fermion number ( including the boundary contribution from @xmath310 ) is equal to @xmath17 or @xmath277  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the argument is unchanged .",
    "the conditions of brst - invariance now read @xmath334 the two conditions arise by requiring that the brst variation of the bulk term be cancelled on both boundaries of the world - sheet . by taking the trace of these two equations and comparing them ,",
    "one infers that the ranks of @xmath296 and @xmath297 are in fact the same , and the constant terms in the equations are also the same .",
    "it follows that any object of @xmath282 is a b - brane .",
    "one can also check that the total brst charge is nilpotent . indeed , it is easy to see that the square of the bulk contribution to the brst charge is equal to @xmath335 on the other hand , the boundary supercharge coming from one of the two boundaries is given by @xmath336 canonical quantization yields @xmath337 and therefore @xmath338 it is also easy to check that @xmath339 and @xmath340 anti - commute ( the holomorphicity of @xmath302 and @xmath303 is important here . )",
    "hence the sum of @xmath340 and the two boundary supercharges is nilpotent .",
    "we start with the case @xmath341 , @xmath50 , where there is only a d0-brane to worry about . in the absence of the superpotential , d0-brane on @xmath43",
    "is associated with the structure sheaf of a point , which has a two - term projective resolution @xmath342 if we pass to @xmath14-graded complexes , we obtain the following dg - module : @xmath343 where @xmath344 and it is understood that the module @xmath345 has the obvious grading .",
    "if we turn on the superpotential , we need to deform the differential so that its square be equal to @xmath50 .",
    "it is clear how to do this : simply consider the object @xmath346 where @xmath347 this is our candidate object for the d0-brane at @xmath51 . as a check ,",
    "let us compute its endomorphism algebra , following kontsevich s prescription .",
    "in the category @xmath282 , the algebra of endomorphisms is @xmath348).\\ ] ] the @xmath14-grading is the natural grading on @xmath349 matrices ( diagonal elements are even , off - diagonal elements are odd ) .",
    "the differential acts on this graded vector space as follows : @xmath350 here @xmath351 are elements of @xmath352 i.e. simply polynomials in @xmath353 .",
    "computing @xmath279 , we find that this abelian group is isomorphic to the group of complex matrices of the form @xmath354 multiplicative structure is given by matrix multiplication . clearly , this algebra is generated over @xmath43 by the identity and an odd matrix @xmath355 which squares to identity .",
    "this agrees with the endomorphism algebra of the d0-brane in the lg model @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss b - branes in the lg model @xmath49 . using the same reasoning as above ,",
    "it is easy to guess that the d2-brane given by the equation @xmath68 should correspond to the object @xmath356 where the map is defined as @xmath357 similarly , the d2-brane given by the equation @xmath69 should correspond to @xmath358 with the twisted differential @xmath359 the group of endomorphisms of the former object in the category @xmath282 is @xmath360),\\ ] ] with the differential which acts as follows : @xmath361 the homology is readily computed ; the result is that it is spanned by the identity matrix .",
    "thus the algebra of endomorphisms in the derived category is isomorphic to @xmath43 .",

    "of course , for the other d2-brane we get the same result . finally , in order to compute morphisms between the two d2-branes , we note that one is a shift of the other .",

    "thus the space of morphisms is the space of endomorphisms with gradings reversed , i.e. it is spanned by the identity matrix regarded as odd .",
    "composing two such odd morphisms going in the opposite directions we get the identity endomorphism .",
    "this agrees with the computations in section  [ sec : cp ] and explains why we declared the space of morphisms between two different d2-branes to be odd .",
    "now let us discuss the d0-brane .",
    "consider the direct sum of objects corresponding to d2-branes with equations @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to see that its algebra of endomorphism is the clifford algebra @xmath62 , so we propose that this object corresponds to the d0-brane .",
    "it is easy to check that morphisms to and from other objects agree with our computations in section  [ sec : cp ] .",
    "finally , we propose an object of @xmath362 corresponding to the d0-brane in the free massive lg model with @xmath2 fields . if we bring the superpotential to the standard form eq .",
    "( [ generalw ] ) , then we can simply tensor @xmath2 copies of the object eq .",
    "( [ d0object ] ) .",
    "consequently , the endomorphism algebra will also be the graded tensor product of @xmath2 copies of @xmath54 , which is isomorphic to @xmath363 .",
    "more invariantly , let @xmath364 be the complex vector space whose coordinates we denoted by @xmath365 , let @xmath366 be the corresponding basis in @xmath63 , let @xmath367 be the dual basis in @xmath368 , and let @xmath246 be the hessian of @xmath11 .",
    "we start with the @xmath14-graded version of the koszul resolution of the point at the origin : @xmath369 where @xmath370 , and the differential is induced by the wedge product with @xmath371 ( we use einstein s convention of summing over repeating indices ) .",
    "now we modify the differential so that its square be @xmath11 instead of zero .",

    "note that @xmath376 is essentially the fourier transform of the dirac operator , if we identify @xmath377 and @xmath378 with spinor bundles .",
    "we regard the above computations as a convincing check of kontsevich s proposal for massive lg models . in this subsection",
    ", we would like to address the following three questions .",
    "first , how do we match b - branes with objects in the category @xmath362 if @xmath379 ? ( as explained in section  [ sec : b ] , it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath380 , @xmath11 quadratic non - degenerate , and @xmath381 . )",
    "second , is there an efficient method to compute morphisms in the category @xmath362 ?",
    "third , assuming the validity of kontsevich s proposal , what do we learn about b - branes in massive lg models ?",
    "that is , is there a simpler way to describe @xmath362 ?    to answer these questions , we will define a functor from the category of b - branes to the category of finite - dimensional @xmath14-graded modules over the clifford algebra @xmath363 .",
    "let us denote this category @xmath382 .",
    "( as usual , we allow both even and odd morphisms ; thus @xmath382 is a @xmath14-graded category . )",
    "since we set @xmath380 , @xmath381 , and @xmath11 is quadratic and non - degenerate , the category @xmath362 really depends only on @xmath2 ; we will denote this category @xmath383 for short .",
    "there is a further functor from @xmath382 to @xmath383 .",
    "composing these two functors gives a way to associate objects of @xmath383 to b - branes .",
    "in fact , as explained below , the second functor is an equivalence of categories which implies that we can calculate morphisms in @xmath382 instead of @xmath383 .",
    "this equivalence is a cousin of the much - studied koszul duality for quadratic algebras ( see below ) .",
    "the structure of @xmath382 is quite simple : any object is a direct sum of irreducible objects ( spinor modules ) , and there is one or two non - isomorphic irreducible objects , depending on whether @xmath2 is odd or even .",
    "thus we have a completely explicit description of @xmath382 , and therefore , by koszul duality , of @xmath383 . assuming the validity of kontsevich s conjecture , this amounts to a solution of topological open string theory for any massive lg model .",
    "one can associate a @xmath14-graded clifford module to a b - brane as follows . for any b - brane @xmath22 ,",
    "consider the graded vector space @xmath384 .",
    "since @xmath208 is isomorphic to @xmath363 as a graded algebra , @xmath385 is a functor from the category of b - branes to the category of left @xmath14-graded modules over @xmath363 .",
    "since spaces of open strings are expected to be finite - dimensional , @xmath386 is expected to be a finite - dimensional vector space .",

    "a linear b - brane of complex dimension @xmath387 $ ] is mapped to a module which is a direct sum of @xmath273-\\ell}$ ] irreducible modules .",
    "next we would like to explain why @xmath382 is equivalent to @xmath383 .",
    "the relation between these two rather different - looking categories is a generalization of the so - called koszul duality for quadratic algebras  @xcite .",
    "any serious attempt to discuss koszul duality would take us out of our depth , so we will just make a few remarks which may help to orient the reader who would like to study these questions deeper .",

    "the enlarged category is equivalent to the category @xmath424 .",
    "now let us interpret these results from the point of view of homological mirror symmetry .",
    "the mirror of the d0-brane has been identified in ref .",
    "@xcite using the dualization argument of ref .",
    "the mirror is a certain lagrangian 2-torus in @xmath10 equipped with a rank one trivial vector bundle and a certain flat connection .",
    "let us be more specific .",
    "consider the unit 5-sphere in @xmath427 , i.e. a hypersurface defined by the equation @xmath428 the quotient of this 5-sphere by a free @xmath429 action @xmath430 is diffeomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , the standard symplectic form on @xmath10 is obtained by restricting to @xmath431 the standard khler form on @xmath427 and then pushing it down to the quotient .",
    "now consider a 3-torus in @xmath427 defined by the equations latexmath:[\\[\\label{3torus }    and invariant with respect to the @xmath429 action .",
    "hence by passing to the quotient , we obtain a 2-torus embedded in @xmath10 .",
    "it is trivial to check that this 2-torus is lagrangian with respect to the standard symplectic form on @xmath10 .",
    "the flat connection can be specified by its monodromy representation .",
    "let @xmath433 and @xmath434 be the loops on the 3-torus  ( [ 3torus ] ) defined by @xmath435 their images under the quotient map generate the fundamental group of our lagrangian 2-torus . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the mirror of the d0-brane sitting at the point @xmath436 @xmath437 corresponds to the monodromy representation which maps both generators to @xmath438 . in particular ,",
    "the d0-brane which sits at the point @xmath425 is mirror to the trivial flat connection on the lagrangian 2-torus .    as a simple check of this claim , note that the algebra of endomorphisms of a d0-brane in the model @xmath49 has euler characteristic zero . in the mirror picture ,",
    "the corresponding object is the euler characteristic of the floer complex , which coincides with the classical euler characteristic of the 2-torus .",
    "thus the euler characteristics match",
    ". it would be nice to compute the floer homology groups as well and to check that they agree with the predictions of mirror symmetry .",
    "namely , we expect that    1 .",
    "the floer homology of the lagrangian 2-torus equipped with a rank - one flat connection is non - vanishing only for the three special flat connections defined above ; 2 .",
    "for these choices of the flat connection , the floer homology is isomorphic to the classical cohomology of the torus as a @xmath14-graded vector space ; 3 .   as a @xmath14-graded algebra ,",
    "the floer homology is isomorphic to the clifford algebra with two generators , i.e. it is a quantum deformation of the classical cohomology ring ; 4 .",
    "floer homology groups which compute morphisms between different flat connections of rank one vanish .",
    "it was argued above that we can formally add d2-branes to the category of b - branes .",
    "it is reasonable to ask if this procedure is consistent with or perhaps even forced on us by homological mirror symmetry . to answer this question",
    "we need to identify the mirrors of the added d2-branes .",
    "there are two such d2-branes for each critical level set . for each of them",
    "the euler characteristic of the endomorphism algebra is @xmath277 .",
    "if we assume that the mirror of a d2-brane is a lagrangian submanifold , then it must be homeomorphic to a real projective plane @xmath439 .",
    "but since @xmath439 is not orientable , it is not an admissible object of the fukaya category ( one needs orientability in order to define @xmath14-graded maslov index and @xmath14-grading on the floer complex ) . we conclude that the mirrors of the added d2-brane can not be lagrangian submanifolds , and therefore homological mirror symmetry does not force us to include them on the b - side .    on the other other hand , if we added d2-branes on the b - side , we can maintain homological mirror symmetry by adding certain objects on the a - side .",
    "in other words , we would like to regard the lagrangian 2-torus with a trivial flat connection , which is mirror to the d0-brane , as a direct sum of two irreducible objects , which are mirror to the d2-branes .",
    "but since there are no such objects in the fukaya category , we simply add these direct summands `` by hand . ''    let us clarify what we mean by adding direct summands `` by hand . ''",
    "let @xmath37 be an object of an additive category @xmath440 .",
    "a projector is an element of @xmath441 which satisfies @xmath442 .",
    "given any projector , we would like to have the corresponding direct summand , i.e. an object @xmath443 and a pair of morphisms @xmath444 and @xmath445 such that @xmath446 and @xmath447 .",
    "if @xmath443 does not exist for all projectors and for all @xmath37 , then we look for the smallest additive category which contains @xmath440 as a full subcategory and in which every projector has a direct summand .    to summarize , to maintain homological mirror symmetry , we must either add formal direct summands on both a and b sides , or on neither side .",
    "the mirror in this case is the lg model with target @xmath448 and the superpotential @xmath449 here @xmath450 and @xmath451 are nonzero complex numbers whose logarithms are mirror to the periods of the complexified khler form on the two @xmath9 s .",
    "this superpotential has four non - degenerate critical points . for generic @xmath452",
    "there are four critical level sets all of which look like a cubic with a node .",
    "thus we are in exactly the same situation as in the previous subsection , and the only b - branes are d0-branes sitting at the critical points .",
    "another way to see these d0-branes is to note that the lg model is a product of two lg models with the superpotential @xmath453 .",
    "this model is mirror to @xmath9 and has been studied in ref .",
    "its only b - branes are d0-branes sitting at the two critical points of the superpotential .",
    "taking tensor products of pairs of such b - branes gives us four d0-branes discussed above .",
    "the mirror of each d0-brane is a lagrangian 2-torus with some flat connection .",
    "indeed , the mirror of a d0-brane in the model @xmath453 is the equatorial circle on @xmath9  @xcite , therefore the mirror of a d0-brane in the product model is the product of two equatorial circles .",
    "the monodromy around the two generators of the fundamental group is @xmath454 .    for @xmath455",
    "something special happens both on the a and b sides . on the a side",
    ", we get a new lagrangian submanifold which is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath353 and @xmath456 be coordinates on the standard affine patches on the two @xmath9 s .",
    "consider the `` anti - diagonal '' 2-sphere given by @xmath457 .",
    "let @xmath458 be the fubini - study form on @xmath9 , @xmath459 be the projection maps from @xmath19 to the two factors , and @xmath460 be complex numbers .",
    "it is trivial to check the restriction of @xmath461 to the `` anti - diagonal ''",
    "2-sphere vanishes if and only if @xmath462 .",
    "thus the 2-sphere is lagrangian if and only if @xmath455 .    on the b side ,",
    "the critical level set @xmath66 now contains two critical points .",
    "the equation of this critical level set @xmath463 shows that it is reducible .",
    "the irreducible components are a line and a non - singular quadric which intersect transversally at two points ; these are the two critical points mentioned above .",
    "we have two irreducible d2-branes of type b corresponding to the two irreducible components of the critical level set .",
    "it is easy to see that one is isomorphic to the shift of the other , while their sum is isomorphic to the sum of two d0-branes sitting at the two critical points .",
    "note that this is another example where the category of b - branes is strictly smaller than the sum of `` local '' categories associated to critical points .",
    "this happens because all d2-branes pass through both critical points in the set @xmath66 .",
    "thus a single d0-brane sitting at a critical point is irreducible . of course , if we only look at the infinitesimal neighborhood of one of the critical points , then we are in the same situation as in the model @xmath49 , and the d0-brane appears to be composite .",
    "if desired , we can enlarge the category of b - branes by adding all formal direct summands .",
    "then it will become equivalent to the sum of categories attached to the two critical points ( each of which is equivalent to @xmath424 ) , and each d0-brane will be the sum of two irreducible objects .",
    "now let us match the objects on a and b sides .",
    "d0-branes correspond to `` equatorial '' lagrangian tori , as before .",
    "the mirror of a d2-brane must be a lagrangian 2-sphere .",
    "indeed , each d2-brane passes through two critical points , each of which contributes @xmath277 to the euler characteristic of the endomorphism algebra .",
    "an obvious conjecture is that the two d2-branes are mirror to the lagrangian 2-sphere discussed above and its shift ( i.e. orientation - reversal ) . if this is true , then the sum of the lagrangian 2-sphere and its shift must be isomorphic ( in the fukaya category ) to the sum of two `` equatorial '' lagrangian tori with monodromies @xmath464 and @xmath465",
    ". it would be interesting to check this by computing the floer homology between all the objects involved .",
    "in this paper we have described the category of b - branes for the free massive lg model with @xmath2 chiral fields .",
    "we also argued that this allows one to determine the category of b - branes for an arbitrary massive lg model .",
    "the most striking feature of our results is their simplicity .",
    "for example , if we consider the free massive lg model , there is a multi - parameter family of maximal isotropic subspaces of the quadric @xmath66 , but they are all isomorphic as objects of the category of b - branes ( up to a shift ) .",
    "moreover , b - branes of lower dimension , including the d0-brane , are isomorphic to direct sums of b - branes of maximal dimension .",
    "these rather counter - intuitive observations solve the problem of computing tree - level topological open string correlators in these models .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those of refs .",
    "@xcite , where a general framework for classifying d - branes in 2d topological field theories has been proposed . in our case , the 2d tft in the bulk is rather trivial : it is isomorphic , as a frobenius algebra , to @xmath43 with its unique frobenius structure . the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite ( generalized to the @xmath14-graded case ) tells us that the algebra of open strings connecting a brane with itself must be simple .",
    "we saw that in our case endomorphism algebras of b - branes are all isomorphic to clifford algebras , and these are indeed simple ( as @xmath14-graded algebras ) .",
    "however , unlike in the purely bosonic case , in the @xmath14-graded case not every two simple finite - dimensional algebras are morita equivalent .",
    "in fact , there are two morita - equivalence classes of such algebras , represented by @xmath43 and @xmath54 .",
    "a clifford algebra with @xmath21 generators is morita - equivalent to @xmath43 or @xmath54 depending on whether @xmath21 is even or odd .",
    "we have seen that when the number of fields @xmath2 is even ( resp .",
    "odd ) only even ( resp .",
    "odd ) values of @xmath21 occur .",
    "this suggests that it is impossible to have a topological open string theory which includes d - branes of both kinds .",
    "indeed , we have seen that all pairings between spaces of morphisms induced by 2-point correlators are either even or odd , depending on whether @xmath2 is even or odd . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the basic axioms of topological open string theory is that all pairings must have the same parity  @xcite .",
    "this observation provides a simple counter - example to the belief that a 2d tft determines uniquely the associated category of topological boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , we can make a stronger statement . given any 2d scft representing a superstring background , we can tensor it with the topological lg model @xmath50 . since the latter theory is trivial",
    ", this does not change the closed string sector .",
    "but the open string sector does change : one has to tensor every `` physical '' d - brane with the d0-brane of the lg model , and this results in tensoring the open string spectrum of each d - brane with @xmath54 .",
    "this is equivalent to the introduction of an odd chan - paton label .",
    "thus we have two inequivalent open string theories for a given closed string theory .",
    "this particular ambiguity is rather mild and can be easily eliminated .",
    "the difference between odd and even @xmath2 comes from the number of fermionic zero modes on a disk , or equivalently from the parity of the bilinear forms computed by the 2-point disk correlators .",
    "thus to specify completely the open string theory we are dealing with , it is sufficient to fix the parity of all bilinear forms",
    ".    it would be interesting to extend the considerations of this paper to lg models which flow to non - trivial scfts in the infrared limit .",
    "for example , one could study landau - ginzburg realizations of @xmath0 minimal models .",
    "for these theories much information about b - branes is available from the boundary state formalism , and it would interesting to see if it is consistent with kontsevich s proposal . by analogy with the massive case , one expects that the category of b - branes will be describable in terms of modules over the algebra of endomorphisms of a d0-brane .",
    "from the mathematical viewpoint , this algebra must be related by a koszul - like duality to the cdg algebra which appears in kontsevich s proposal .",
    "it appears that for @xmath11 of degree",
    "higher than two koszul duality relates kontsevich s cdg algebra to a finite - dimensional @xmath7-algebra  @xcite .",
    "b - branes should correspond to finite - dimensional @xmath7-modules over this @xmath7-algebra . in this way solving topological open string theory is reduced to a problem in linear algebra .",
    "hopefully , the latter problem is manageable .    in the axiomatic approach of refs .",

    "<S> we study topological d - branes of type b in @xmath0 landau - ginzburg models , focusing on the case where all vacua have a mass gap . in general , </S>",
    "<S> tree - level topological string theory in the presence of topological d - branes is described mathematically in terms of a triangulated category . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it has been argued that b - branes for an @xmath0 sigma - model with a calabi - yau target space are described by the derived category of coherent sheaves on this space . </S>",
    "<S> m.  kontsevich previously proposed a candidate category for b - branes in @xmath0 landau - ginzburg models , and our computations confirm this proposal . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a heuristic physical derivation of the proposal . </S>",
    "<S> assuming its validity , we can completely describe the category of b - branes in an arbitrary massive landau - ginzburg model in terms of modules over a clifford algebra . </S>",
    "<S> assuming in addition homological mirror symmetry , our results enable one to compute the fukaya category for a large class of fano varieties . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a ( somewhat trivial ) counter - example to the hypothesis that given a closed string background there is a unique set of d - branes consistent with it . </S>"
