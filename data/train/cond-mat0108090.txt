    "the previous paper on babio@xmath0 @xcite presents a simple and yet sufficiently realistic model @xcite which gives a microscopic description of the peierls distortion , and makes unambiguous predictions about the low - energy behavior .",
    "the previous paper looks carefully at the small polarons created by doping or photoemission .",
    "these were noticed already by yu , chen , and su @xcite .",
    "here we examine what happens when an electron - hole pair is inserted , and discover a self - trapped exciton which has not previously been discussed .",
    "this excitation gives a natural explanation for the urbach tail seen in optical absorption @xcite and for the multi - phonon replicas of the oxygen breathing phonon ( the peierls mode ) seen by kozlov _",
    "@xcite in infrared absorption , and by tajima _",
    "@xcite in raman scattering .",
    "the model @xcite , based on work by rice and sneddon @xcite , has nearest - neighbor hopping ( with strength @xmath1 ) of electrons between bi @xmath2-orbitals on a cubic lattice .",
    "oxygens which lie between pairs of bi atoms , experience a linear repulsive force @xmath3 away from the bi atom with the larger electron charge ( @xmath4 ) and toward the bi atom with the smaller electron charge ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the oxygen atom also has a harmonic einstein spring constant @xmath6 .",
    "the model has a single dimensionless constant @xmath7 in adiabatic approximation ( motion of the oxygen atoms neglected . )",
    "we choose parameters @xmath1=0.35 ev , @xmath8 ev@xmath9 , @xmath10 ev@xmath11 , yielding @xmath12 .",
    "as in the previous paper , the zero bandwidth ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) case provides a soluble limit which gives good insight into the more complete theory . if a hole is created in the lower peierls or occupied valence band , and an electron in the upper peierls or empty conduction band , without allowing any lattice relaxation , the energy cost is @xmath16 .",
    "the hole is a bi@xmath17 ion on a site normally occupied by bi@xmath18 , and the electron is a bi@xmath17 ion on a site normally occupied by bi@xmath19 .",
    "because of the simple hamiltonian , the problem has particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this is true at all values of parameters , not just @xmath14 .",
    "upper and lower peierls bands have energies @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the nearest neighbor `` cosine '' band dispersion",
    ". thus particle and hole bands are symmetrical .",
    "if the electron and hole are spatially separated , each will lower its energy by lattice relaxation .",
    "both electron and hole save @xmath23 in elastic energy by moving surrounding oxygens half way back to their cubic perovskite positions .",
    "however , each unpaired electron on a bi@xmath17 ion has its on - site energy increased by @xmath24 , for a net lowering of energy by @xmath25 for each , or a cost of 3@xmath24 to create the isolated pair of polarons .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : str ] , there is an advantage to having the electron and hole polarons form on adjacent bi ions .",
    "the oxygen between the two bi@xmath17 ions can further relax to the undistorted perovskite position .",
    "rather than 12 , now only 10 oxygens are half displaced , saving an additional @xmath26 in elastic energy .",
    "this bound pair of polarons , called a `` self - trapped exciton , '' costs @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 to create .",
    "the total energy gain from lattice relaxation is the exciton binding energy @xmath29 .",
    "taking the on - site coulomb interaction into account , the break - up of the bi@xmath18 paired electrons into separated electron - hole pairs will reduce the excited state energy further , to @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the hubbard on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the energy of the ground and excited state depend on the amount of lattice distortion .",
    "the configuration coordinate @xmath32 smoothly connects the optimal oxygen configurations of the ground state at @xmath33 and the self - trapped exciton state at @xmath34 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] .",
    "the energy depends quadratically on @xmath32 , separating ground and excited state by the gap @xmath28 at @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath35 we are not able to solve analytically , and rely on numerical studies .",
    "we find that the excited state has zero slope @xmath36 at @xmath33 , and downward curvature .",
    "no potential barrier separates the excited state at @xmath33 and the self - trapped exciton at @xmath34 .",
    "this is contrary to most self - trapped exciton theories @xcite , where a metastable free excited state and a self - trapped exciton state can coexist , separated by a potential barrier",
    ".    for @xmath35 , localizing and delocalizing terms in the hamiltonian compete against each other , yielding a critical coupling constant @xmath37 above which self - trapped exciton states exist . to obtain the lowest excited state numerically , oxygen positions are varied using the algorithm described in the preceding paper , under the constraint that an electron was removed from the highest - lying valence band state and inserted in the lowest - lying conduction band state .",
    "we find @xmath38 , close to the polaron stability limit @xmath39 of the previous paper . since the self - trapped exciton is an electron - polaron weakly bound to a hole - polaron , it is not surprising that the polaron and the self - trapped exciton have similar threshold coupling constants .",
    "the first correction to strong coupling for @xmath40 can be approximated using a `` vacuum correction '' of order @xmath41 discussed in sect.iii.a of the preceding paper : @xmath42 and approaches asymptotically the @xmath14 limit @xmath29 .",
    "the behavior of self - trapped exciton states and their evolution with @xmath43 is very similar that of polarons @xcite .",
    "the local change in the oxygen environment leads to the appearance of localized gap states ( fig.[fig : gapst ] ) in addition to the states which constitute the exciton .",
    "six states emerge from the valence band and six from the conduction band , symmetrically around @xmath44 , because of electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the lowest five states have a small upward shift ( @xmath45 when @xmath14 ) from the top of the valence band , and remain doubly occupied .",
    "these are electrons on the five a sites surrounding the b sublattice site now occupied by the excited electron ( called the `` exciton - electron '' ) .",
    "their degeneracy is partly lifted when they couple to other sites by hopping , shifting their energies toward the valence band .",
    "the next state up also derives from the valence band , and is occupied once .",
    "it is the electron that remains behind on an a site when one electron is removed .",
    "alternately , this is the site of the `` exciton - hole '' . its energy ( @xmath46 above the valence band when @xmath1=0 ) is slightly higher than for an isolated hole state ( @xmath47 ) because one of the six surrounding oxygens , shared by the exciton - electron and the exciton - hole , is fully relaxed to the symmetric position .",
    "with decreasing coupling strength , the states spread out , as can be seen in the continuous evolution of their inverse participation ratios ( ipr ) in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad ] .",
    "the ipr @xmath48 for a state @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 where the sum runs over all sites .",
    "it measures the localization of a state .",
    "an ipr of @xmath51 represents a state that is localized on @xmath52 atoms .",
    "the mean radius @xmath53 of the two states comprising the exciton is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad ] .",
    "the particles are confined approximately to one site for @xmath54 . for @xmath55 , they delocalize rapidly , as indicated by the diverging radius .",
    "the self - trapped exciton evolves smoothly into a localized amplitude excitation of the charge - density wave , before disappearing into a band electron - hole pair at @xmath56 , just as @xcite the small polaron evolves through a large cdw - like polaron state before becoming a band hole at @xmath57 .",
    "in this section we discuss the observability of self - trapped excitons in experiment _ via _ an urbach tail in optical absorption experiments and a multi - phonon spectrum of the `` breathing mode '' in phonon experiments , both governed by the franck - condon effect .",
    "zheng and nasu @xcite have also obtained theoretically a tail in the optical conductivity .",
    "their theory includes quantum lattice fluctuations ( as does ours ) and bears some relation to our theory .    as a first step we neglect both coulomb and lattice polarization effects .",
    "then the imaginary part of the dielectric constant can be computed exactly in electric dipole approximation .",
    "the dipole matrix element between an @xmath2 state on a bi atom at @xmath58 and one on the neighboring bi atom at @xmath59 is @xmath60 this gives the correct intraband @xmath61 relation between momentum matrix element and group velocity .",
    "then for for unpolarized light we get @xmath62 this was evaluated numerically using a tetrahedron code @xcite , and is shown as the dashed line in fig.[fig : e2lin ] .",
    "the behavior of @xmath63 is dominated by the divergence of the joint - density of states at photon energy @xmath64 , corresponding to transitions from states at the top of the lower peierls band into those at the bottom of the upper band .",
    "these states are mainly responsible for the charge disproportion and have vanishing amplitude on the @xmath65 and @xmath66 sites respectively .",
    "these are also the states from which localized polaron and self - trapped exciton states form .",
    "since transitions between these states are highest in optical density , we may expect the line shape to be dominated by the signature of self - trapped excitons .",
    "materials with self - trapped excitons show franck - condon broadening of electronic transitions , a concept well known to molecular spectroscopists , since molecular excited electronic states generally have altered nuclear coordinates .",
    "the process involves simultaneous creation of electronic excitation and nuclear vibrations , causing the appearance of vibrational sidebands in the electronic spectra @xcite . in simple solids ,",
    "excitations are usually delocalized which eliminates this effect@xcite .",
    "however , in case of self - localized states , because of their significant lattice relaxation , franck - condon broadening of the electronic transitions must reappear .",
    "@xmath67 in franck - condon approximation is given by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the electronic dipole matrix element between the electronic ground @xmath70 and excited state @xmath71 , @xmath72 the probability to find @xmath73 vibrational quanta in the electronic ground state and @xmath74 the overlap integral between the vibrational wave functions @xmath75 .",
    "this integral can be large even when the vibrational quantum numbers @xmath73 , @xmath76 are quite different from each other , because the vibrational wave - functions @xmath75 , @xmath77 have origins which are off - set from each other .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the broadening of the electronic transition derives from the overlap of zero point motion of the oxygens with excited vibrations in the electronic excited state .",
    "the sum over @xmath73 in eq.([eq : fc ] ) then has only one term , @xmath78 .",
    "we lift the adiabatic approximation applied so far by adding quantized vibrations , but treat the problem in the atomic limit ( @xmath14 ) , i.e. in single site approximation .",
    "the excited electron states couple to eleven oxygens , which are treated as independent einstein oscillators with frequency @xmath79 and oxygen mass @xmath80 in our model .",
    "they move in harmonic potentials and thus the franck - condon factor @xcite is a product of eleven vibrational overlap integrals of the form @xmath81 with : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the oxygen equilibrium positions of the ground and excited state respectively . the total absorption at a frequency @xmath86 , requires a sum over all different ways to distribute @xmath73 quanta over the eleven oxygens .",
    "the result is @xmath87 in our simplified einstein model , absorption occurs at discrete frequencies corresponding to different numbers of vibrations created in the absorption process . in reality",
    "these peaks are broadened by phonon dispersion , and discreteness of the individual peaks should only be seen for one or two vibrational quanta .",
    "the line shape should look similar to the envelope function of fig.[fig : e2lin ] , with maximal absorption at @xmath88 and significant absorption below the gap at @xmath28=2 ev .",
    "the absorption spectra of self - trapped excitons will change with temperature due to the temperature - dependent occupation of vibrational states in the electronic ground state given by @xmath89 , where the partition function @xmath90 is @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "temperature enhances the absorption in the low energy regime and shifts the on - set of absorption to smaller energies .",
    "the temperature effect up to room temperature is very weak . at @xmath93",
    "the probability to find a phonon on one of the eleven oxygens is less than 6% .",
    "the analytical calculations for temperature corrections become increasingly tedious and fig.[fig : e2log ] shows a first temperature correction obtained numerically .",
    "the clearest evidence for self - trapped excitons is normally @xcite observation of weak sub - gap features in optical absorption @xmath94 and a large stokes shift in the luminescence spectrum .",
    "we are not aware of luminescence measurements .",
    "transient absorption measurements @xcite have been interpreted as indicating that interband excitations relax rapidly to a state shifted down by 0.7 ev .",
    "transmission measurements through thin single crystals were reported by kozlov _",
    "these have been interpreted as showing an indirect band gap at 0.5 ev with anomalous temperature dependence .",
    "we believe that the measured absorption can be re - interpreted as an urbach tail arising from the self - trapped exciton , with binding energy @xmath40 enhanced beyond our values by the on - site coulomb @xmath31 .",
    "clear experimental support for the existence of self - trapped excitons in babio@xmath0 comes from harmonics of the peierls breathing mode phonon seen both in raman experiments @xcite and in the infrared @xcite .",
    "these spectra are dominated by a strong peak at 570@xmath95 , assigned to the breathing mode @xmath96 @xmath97 phonon . unlike in ordinary semi - conductors , a series of higher harmonics is observed .",
    "the simplest explanation for the raman process is that the incoming photon creates a virtual self - trapped exciton , except that because of the franck - condon principle , the lattice coordinates stay at their ground state rather than their excited state values , which means that a cloud of virtual local vibrations is also created . when this virtual excitation re - radiates the scattered photon ,",
    "not all the virtual vibrational quanta need to disappear .",
    "the test of this mechanism is that this process is resonant when the laser photon energy coincides with the peierls gap .",
    "this resonance was seen by tajima _",
    "similar behavior occurs in the raman spectrum of lamno@xmath0 @xcite where a somewhat different species of self - trapped exciton is predicted to occur @xcite . in the infrared spectrum of babio@xmath0 ,",
    "the selection rule against raman phonons appearing in infrared must be violated by local loss of inversion symmetry due to static or dynamic lattice fluctuations .",
    "multiples of the breathing phonon are as easily excited as a single phonon because of the vibrational overlap factors ."
