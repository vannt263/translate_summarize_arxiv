    "several observations made over the recent years , related to a large extension to large scale structures ( lss ) and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as well as the magnitude  redshift relation for type ia supernovae have given us a convincing picture of the energy and matter density in the universe @xcite .",
    "baryonic matter accounts for no more than 30@xmath4 of the mass in galaxy clusters while the existence of a large clustered component of dark matter ( dm ) seems now firmly established , although its nature is still unknown . however , they contribute to the total energy density of the universe with only a few percent and about 25@xmath4 respectively .",
    "no more than another few percent could be accounted for by massive neutrinos , but only in the most favorable , but unlikely case . according to @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) the total mass of neutrinos can not exceed the limit of 1.43 @xmath5 ( see , however , @xcite for a recent analysis on neutrino mass limits in coupled dark energy models ) . a very small part @xmath6 of the total energy density is due to massless neutrinos and cmb radiation .",
    "the model suggested by observations is only viable if the remaining 75@xmath4 is ascribed to the so  called dark energy ( de ) responsible for the present day cosmic acceleration .",
    "although strongly indicated by the observations , the existence of de is even more puzzling than dm .",
    "it can be identified with a cosmological constant @xmath0 or with a yet unknown dynamical component with negative pressure . on the other hand",
    ", its manifestation can be interpreted as a geometrical property of the gravity on large scales resulting from a failure of general relativity ( gr ) on those scales ( see @xcite for a review ) .    within the context of gr , as an alternative to the cosmological constant",
    ", de is usually described as a scalar field @xmath7 , self  interacting through a suitable potential @xmath8 , or a cosmic fluid with negative pressure @xcite ( see @xcite for alternatives and references therein ) .",
    "scalar fields naturally arise in particle physics .",
    "furthermore , if they are _ tracker _ fields @xcite , _ fine tunings _ associated to the small value of the present de energy density can be significantly alleviated unlike the cosmological constant case .",
    "in addition to self  interaction , a scalar field can in principle be coupled to any other field present in nature . however , in order to drive the cosmic acceleration , its present time mass is expected to be , at least on large scales , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the present hubble parameter ) .",
    "such a tiny mass gives rise to long  range interactions which could be tested with fifth  force type experiments .",
    "couplings to ordinary particles are strongly constrained by such a kind of experiments but limits on the dm coupling are looser ( constraints on coupling for specific models were obtained in @xcite from cmb , n - body simulations and matter power spectrum analysis ) .    a possible common origin of dm and de and/or a their direct coupling @xcite .",
    "would ease one of the most critical problems in modern cosmology , the so  called _ coincidence problem _ : why expansion started to accelerate just at the eve of our cosmic epoch , after decelerating during all epochs after inflation ? why de and dm have similar densities just now ? because of the coupling dm and de densities keep similar values during a long period and the only peculiar feature of the present epoch is the recent overtaking of dm density by de density .",
    "if present , dm  de coupling could have a relevant role in the cosmological evolution affecting not only the overall cosmic expansion but also modifying the dm particles dynamics with relevant consequences on the growth of the matter density perturbations in both linear and nonlinear regime ( e.g. , on halo density profiles , cluster mass function and its evolution , see @xcite .",
    "lss is then a powerful probe of de nature which permit to put significant constraints on de parameters . constraints often become even more stringent when data from other probes are simultaneously taken into account .",
    "cmb is another powerful probe of de nature . in principle , by joining anisotropy and polarization data , de parameters can be significantly constrained .",
    "cmb and lss probe the universe at different epochs and are therefore complementary to each other",
    ". future data from high resolution cmb experiment like planck and lss surveys ( euclid , lsst , des , jdem , etc ) will allow to constrain de up to an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "in this paper we will focus on the integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "isw effect is a secondary anisotropy of the cmb and a direct signature of de .",
    "the effect arises when a photon from the last scattering surface passes through a time ",
    "dependent gravitational potential changing its energy so that additional temperature anisotropies are generated .",
    "decay of gravitational potentials may occur through cosmic curvature , in the presence of de or in alternative gravity models .",
    "assuming general relativity is the correct theory of gravity and that the universe is spatially flat , large  scale gravitational potentials do not evolve significantly in the matter era .",
    "cosmic acceleration , however , causes the gravitational potentials to decay making the isw effect highly sensitive to the presence of de .    though difficult to detect directly in the cmb , isw signal can be measured by cross  correlating the cmb with tracers of lss and has recently been detected using wmap data of cmb in combination with several lss surveys at the the @xmath11 confidence level providing independent evidence for the existence of the de ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "cross - correlation then provides a powerful method to discriminate among different de models and , in particular , to detect a possible interaction between de and dm other than investigate the clustering properties of de on large scales . if present , dm  de coupling changes both the scaling of the dm energy density and the growth rate of matter perturbations yielding a significant evolution of the metric potentials even in the matter era .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an exhaustive analysis of the isw effect in the contest of the _ so called _ coupled de cosmologies @xcite mainly focusing on the effects of the dm  de coupling on the cross ",
    "correlation between galaxy / quasar distributions and isw effect .",
    "such models can be motivated in the contest of scalar ",
    "tensor theories of gravity or describe the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory beyond the standard model of particle physics , e.g. string theory .    the models which we aim to investigate differ from the standard @xmath0cdm in three different aspects : ( i ) de is a self  interacting scalar field @xmath7 rather than a cosmological constant @xmath0 . we shall consider a class of self  interaction potentials @xmath8 admitting _",
    "tracker solutions_. ( ii ) a linear dm  de coupling is allowed .",
    "( iii ) we allow neutrinos to be massive .    the effects of massive neutrinos in cosmology have been studied thoroughly for many years ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological observations are mostly sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses , @xmath12 .",
    "currently , the strongest upper limit on neutrino mass scale comes from cosmology .",
    "one of the effects of massive neutrinos is to induce a small decay of the gravitational potentials during both matter and de domination so that , in principle , isw effect would also provide information on their mass .",
    "furthermore , as recently outlined in @xcite the effects that massive neutrinos have on the angular power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies , @xmath13 , and matter power spectrum , @xmath14 , are almost opposite to those of the dm  de coupling , resulting in a strong degeneracy between the coupling strength @xmath15 and @xmath12 .",
    "a recent analysis by means of monte carlo markov chain method has shown that a cosmology with significant @xmath12 and @xmath15 is statistically preferred to one with no coupling and almost massless neutrinos .",
    "further , when priors on the neutrino mass from earth - based neutrino mass experiments ( heidelberg - moscow neutrinoless double @xmath15-decay , katrin tritium @xmath15-decay ) are added to the analysis , a @xmath16 detection of a dm - de coupling is found .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe our model while the isw effect theory is reviewed in section 3 where we also discuss how the isw signal depends on the main parameters of the model . in section 4",
    "we discuss galaxy bias and magnification bias .",
    "comparison between theoretical prediction and observation data is presented in section 5 while a tomographic analysis is performed in section 6 .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we assume a spatially flat friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) background with metric @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the conformal time ) filled with baryons , photons , neutrinos , dm and a component of de which will be ascribed to a scalar field @xmath7 self  interacting through a potential @xmath8 . in the following , the indexes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath7 will denote baryons , cold dm , massive neutrinos and de .",
    "photons and massless neutrinos will be referred as radiation and denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "in addition to self  interaction we also consider a possible interaction between the scalar field and dm . here",
    "we give only the equations for baryons , dm and de being the equations for the other components the usual ones ( see , e.g @xcite ) .    the friedmann equation for the scale factor @xmath23 , the continuity equations for baryons and dm and the evolution equation for the scalar field read :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath18 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the energy density of the component @xmath28 and the constant @xmath29 parametrizes the dm  de coupling strength .    working in the conformal newtonian gauge",

    "linear perturbation equations for dm and baryons read : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the baryon sound speed , @xmath45 is the standard term describing momentum exchange with photons due to thomson scattering ( see , e.g ma & bertschinger 1995 ) and @xmath46 is the perturbation to the scalar field which evolves according to : @xmath47    as we are interested in the cross",
    " correlation between isw effect and galaxy distributions , above equations can be simplified . at late time",
    "radiation and massive neutrinos can be neglected so that no shear stresses are present and @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , the cross ",
    "correlation signal comes from scales well within the horizon , @xmath49 mpc , so that the second term in ( 6 ) can be neglected .",

    "widely discussed in @xcite , coupling affects the dynamics of dm particles . as a consequence baryons and",
    "dm develop a bias @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "notice that , this bias , which origin is to ascribe to the coupling , is something completely different from the galaxy bias due to hydrodynamical effects , discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , unlike the uncoupled case , in the presence of coupling , universe goes through an evolutionary phase named @xmath7matter dominated era ( @xmath7mde ) just after matter  radiation equivalence . in this period",
    "the scalar field @xmath7 behaves as @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) having a non ",
    "negligible kinetic energy which dominates over the potential one . after this stage ,",
    "the usual matter era follows before entering in the accelerated regime with a final de sitter attractor .",
    "notice also that , because of the @xmath7mde and the non ",
    "usual scaling of the dm energy density , i.e. @xmath59 , after equivalence the background expansion law will differ from the usual @xmath60 .",
    "[ f1 ]    we shall consider the ratra  peebles ( rp ) @xcite and sugra self  interaction potentials",
    "@xcite , reading @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively ; they allow tracker solutions for any @xmath63 . for both potentials , once @xmath64 and @xmath0 are assigned , the present time de density parameter @xmath65 is uniquely defined .    limits on these models without coupling between de and cdm have been studied in la vacca & kristiansen 2009 .",
    "they find , that only quite small @xmath66 are allowed . in the sugra case in particular",
    "only @xmath67 is allowed .",
    "such small values are well below the range motivated by particle physics .",
    "therefore the physical appeal of the sugra potential is spoiled .",
    "let us however outline that , when the @xmath15 degree of freedom is opened , @xmath0 values as large as 30@xmath68gev become allowed , at the 1@xmath69 level , while , at the 2@xmath69 level , no significant constraint on the energy scale @xmath0 remains . even for the rp potential , for which a limit @xmath70 held , in the absence of coupling , values @xmath71 become allowed ( la vacca et al 2009 )",
    ".    in the absence of dm  de coupling , rp yields",
    "quite a slowly varying @xmath72 state parameter . on the contrary",
    ", sugra yields a fast varying @xmath73 .",
    "although coupling causes a @xmath73 behavior significantly different from the uncoupled case , one could again consider these potentials as examples of rapidly or slowly varying @xmath73 .",
    "the results shown in the next two sections are qualitatively the same for rp and sugra models .",
    "we will show them only for sugra cosmologies while the results for rp models will be shown only when comparing the theoretical predictions with observational data and dealing with redshift tomography .",
    "isw effect arises when cmb photons from the last scattering surface pass through a time ",
    "dependent gravitational potential changing its energy so that additional temperature anisotropies are generated .",
    "the isw temperature fluctuation , @xmath74 , is given by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the cmb temperature and @xmath77 is the visibility function of the photons .",
    "as outlined in previous section , we will deal with scales within the horizon and redshifts such that radiation and any anisotropic stress can be neglected ( @xmath48 ) . in the matter era and in the absence of dm  de coupling ( @xmath78 ) ,",
    "poisson equation reads : @xmath79 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the total matter density parameter and density contrast respectively ) from which one can appreciate that the gravitational potential stays constant , @xmath82 , and no isw effect arises .",
    "however , when de starts to dominate the cosmic expansion , @xmath31 is no longer constant and isw effect generates secondary anisotropies in the cmb .    on the other hand ,",
    "as explained in the previous section , dm - de coupling affects both the background and density perturbation evolution , resulting in a variation of @xmath31 even during the matter domination .",
    "figure 1 shows how @xmath15 and @xmath83 affect the time evolution of the sum @xmath84 which time derivative forms the source of the isw effect .",
    "evolution of the gravitational potentials is obtained by a modified version of the public code cmbfast integrating the fully relativistic equations and taking into account the contributions of all of the components , i.e , photons , dm , baryons , neutrinos and de .",
    "notice how @xmath15 and @xmath83 affect @xmath84 in an opposite fashion .",
    "performing a measurement of the isw effect is , however , a difficult task because of its small signal compared with that of primary anisotropies ( @xmath85 times larger ) .",
    "furthermore , while on small scales the small differences in temperature tend to cancel out , the large scales , from which the most isw effect contributes come from , are strongly affected by the cosmic variance",

    "the transition between the two above regimes occurs around @xmath119 gev .",

    "again , the behavior of the cross ",
    "correlation reflects that of the isw source .",

    "[ fnu ] which displays the behavior of @xmath114 as a function of @xmath83 at two different redshifts .",
    "cross - correlation signal always decreases at the increasing of the neutrino mass .",
    "the galaxy bias @xmath19 can , in general , evolve both in redshift or as a function of the scale .",
    "however , on the large scales of interest for the isw effect , the bias is usually assumed to be linear , spatially constant and only redshift  dependent , i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "this assumption is fully consistent with results from numerical simulations , redshift surveys and semi  analytic calculation in the contest of the so  called halo  model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , given a galaxy selection function @xmath112 picked at certain redshift @xmath121 , the bias can be approximated with an appropriated constant . in this case",

    "our tomographic study was based on a signal  to  noise analysis .",
    "we started our discussion investigating the effect on @xmath3 of ignoring the quasar bias evolution and magnification bias correction for an ideal survey .",
    "we found that , if the overall quasar distribution is used , cross  correlation measurements are more affected by errors when ignoring the quasar bias evolution ( @xmath215 ) rather than the magnification bias correction ( @xmath216 )    however , when dealing with tomography the error on @xmath174 ( @xmath40 indicating the @xmath40th bin ) never overcome @xmath217 if the quasar bias in each bin is approximated with an appropriated constant , but it can reach @xmath218 , at high redshifts , when magnification bias is ignored .",
