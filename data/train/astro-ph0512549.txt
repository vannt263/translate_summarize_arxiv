    "observations show that the x - ray emission from many clusters of galaxies is sharply peaked around the central brightest galaxy .",
    "the inferred radiative cooling time of the gas in that peak , where the temperature drops to the center , is much shorter than the age of the cluster , suggesting the existence of a cooling flow there @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy over the past 5 yr shows that the temperature drop toward the center is limited to about a factor of three .",
    "just when the gas should be cooling most rapidly it appears not to be cooling at all .",
    "this is sometimes known as the cooling flow problem .",
    "careful observations show that gently distributed heat is required over a radius of up to 100  kpc to balance radiative cooling in these regions .",
    "the issues of cooling and heating of hot gas have broad relevance to the gaseous part of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) are the most massive galaxies known . calculations of the clustering behaviour of cold dark matter predict a power - law mass distribution for large galaxies whereas the stellar mass observed has an exponential distribution @xcite .",
    "the truncation of the stellar mass distribution in massive galaxies is likely due to the process which stops cooling flows .",
    "simple cooling flows are an ingredient of semi - analytical models for galaxy formation .",
    "the cooling of hot gas to form stars is essential for the growth of massive galaxies and can not be studied directly for isolated systems due to galactic absorption .",
    "the cores of galaxy clusters offer examples which can be directly observed .",
    "however they do not appear to operate in any simple manner .",
    "the problem appears to be widespread , from the most massive clusters to the centers of individual elliptical galaxies .",
    "heating and cooling problems of hot gases are common in astronomy , with examples ranging from the interstellar medium of our own galaxy to the solar corona .",
    "the diffuse hot ionized plasma in clusters is magnetized which means that mhd processes may be important @xcite .",
    "here we briefly review the main x - ray properties and emission processes of the intracluster medium ( icm ) before showing the x - ray spectra of cool cores .",
    "we then discuss the main solutions which have been proposed for the cooling flow problem .",
    "clusters are the most massive bound and quasi - relaxed objects in the universe .",
    "they have total masses of @xmath0 to above @xmath1 .",
    "the total gas fraction is about 16 per cent with about 13 per cent in the hot icm and the remaining 3 per cent in stars in the cluster galaxies .",
    "the remaining 84 per cent of the mass is in dark matter .",
    "gas densities in cluster centers range from as much as @xmath2 in peaked clusters to @xmath3 in the non - peaked ones .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the mean cosmic density of baryons of about @xmath4 .",
    "the characteristic or virial radius , @xmath5 , of a cluster , defined from the theory of structure collapse in an expanding universe as where the mean density of the cluster is 200 times the critical density of the universe ( i.e. @xmath6 , with the hubble constant at redshift @xmath7 varying as @xmath8 , is typically between 1 and 3  mpc .",
    "the gas is heated by gravitational infall to temperatures close to the virial temperature @xmath9 , which ranges in clusters from 115  kev .",
    "the total x - ray luminosities range from about @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "objects at lower masses and luminosities are groups which have from a few to tens of member galaxies as compared with the hundreds of galaxies in a typical cluster",
    ".    structure formation in the universe proceeds in a hierarchical manner with the most massive objects , clusters , forming last , which means now .",
    "they continue to evolve by the infall of subclusters .",
    "the time since the last major merger is typically about 5  gyr .",
    "about 20 per cent of clusters have had a more recent merger or are undergoing one .",
    "these are not the subject of this review .",
    "analytic and numerical simulations of cluster formation indicate that the total x - ray luminosity @xmath12 in the absence of gas cooling and heating .",
    "this follows since the x - ray luminosity is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung so @xmath13 , the mean gas density @xmath14 is constant and @xmath15 .",
    "the temperature drops monotonically outward ( by a factor of up to about 2 ) .",
    "observations instead show @xmath16 over the temperature range 28  kev with a wide dispersion at lower temperatures and a possible flattening above .",
    "the simplest explanation for this result is that the gas has had additional heating of 23  kev per particle @xcite .",
    "the effect of such heating is not to increase the temperature by that amount but mostly to expand the gas ( reducing its density and thus x - ray luminosity ) .",
    "such energy is plausibly due to energy output from active galaxies , i.e. accreting black holes in cluster galaxies . alternatively ,",
    "radiative cooling by removing the low - entropy gas in star formation may reproduce the relation as well @xcite .",
    "the gas has generally been enriched to 0.3 of the solar value by early supernovae .",
    "in relaxed clusters the potential and gas peak on the bcg .",
    "the metallicity often rises to solar or even higher around the bcg , probably due to sn ia .    in relaxed",
    ", x - ray peaked , clusters the temperature profile is often inverted in the inner core ( i.e. @xmath17 ) dropping inward as @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the gas density there rises as @xmath20 .",
    "the overall profiles of the gas density and temperature depend on the entropy of the gas and thus on its heating and cooling history , subject to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the pressure , @xmath23 is the mass density , @xmath24 is the number density , @xmath25 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath26 is the temperature , @xmath27 is newton s constant , @xmath28 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath29 is the enclosed mass within a radius @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the proton mass , and @xmath32 is the mean mass per particle . this equation is used to estimate the total mass profile of clusters .",
    "massive ones can act as gravitational lenses for background galaxies as seen in the optical band which provides another means to measure mass profiles .",
    "agreement between profiles determined by both methods @xcite show that hydrostatic equilibrium holds well in the main body of relaxed massive lensing clusters and that any non - thermal pressure there is not dominant .",
    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) is plasma that is nearly fully ionized due to the high temperatures created by the deep dark matter gravitational potential .",
    "hydrogen and helium , for example , are fully stripped of their electrons .",
    "heavier elements have retained only a few of their electrons in this hot medium .",
    "in addition to free electrons and ions in the plasma , electromagnetic radiation , which is emitted mostly as x - rays , is created by quantum mechanical interactions in the plasma .",
    "the physics of the icm can be studied as two physical phenomena : 1 ) the ionized plasma , and 2 ) the radiation emission processes .",
    "the ionized plasma is well - described by magneto - hydrodynamic theory on large enough scales .",
    "the radiation emission processes are governed by equations for x - ray emission from a collisionally - ionized plasma .",
    "we can treat these phenomena separately because the intracluster medium is mostly optically - thin , ( i.e. the radiation almost completely escapes without interacting with the plasma ) . later in the next section",
    ", we will show that this is the case .    in  3.1 ,",
    "we describe how x - rays are produced in the intracluster medium . in section",
    " 3.2 , we motivate magneto - hydrodynamic theory as the description of the plasma . in  3.3 , we unify the two theoretical descriptions to produce what we refer to as the `` standard cooling - flow model '' .",
    "this model will serve as the basis for the physical description of the cores of clusters of galaxies .",
    "in later sections , we describe the puzzling observations that seem to agree with many expectations of this model , but disagree strongly with other aspects of the model .",
    "ionized plasmas produce copious amounts of x - rays .",
    "the emission of x - rays has two important consequences .",
    "first , it allows us to observe the intracluster medium by detecting those x - rays .",
    "furthermore , since most of those x - rays do not interact between their emission and their detection in x - ray telescopes it allows us to study the intracluster medium in an unperturbed state . through x - ray spectroscopy and imaging",
    ", we can measure several physical quantities , such as the temperature and density , at various positions in the cluster .",
    "the second important consequence is that the emission of these x - rays will tend to cool the plasma .",
    "a significant quantity of energy is carried away by the x - rays as they escape the cluster .",
    "the emission of these x - rays was thought to set up a non - linear process of excessive cooling in cluster cores that is broadly termed a `` cooling flow '' , a major subject of this work . in the following ,",
    "we describe the process of x - ray emission from collisionally - ionized plasmas and show how it relates to the intracluster medium",
    ".      the emission of x - rays from ionized atoms in a plasma can be quite complex .",
    "fortunately , we can make use of several approximations to simplify the emission processes .",
    "the emission of x - rays in the icm is well - described by the coronal approximation @xcite .",
    "these approximations describe optically - thin plasmas in collisional equilibrium .",
    "collisional equilibrium occurs when electron collisional ionization processes are balanced precisely by recombination processes . the coronal approximation , as the name implies , was originally developed for study of the solar corona , but the condition also applies to gas in clusters of galaxies , as well as hot gas in elliptical , starburst galaxies , and older supernovae remnants . in this approximation",
    ", there are three important conditions that specify the thermodynamic state of the free electrons , ions , and photons in the plasma , as well as the electron distribution within each ion .",
    "the first approximation is that the photons are assumed to be free and do not interact with either the electrons or the ions after they are created .",
    "this has the importance consequence that photo - ionization processes ( ionizing atoms by photons ) and photo - excitation processes ( raising an electron in an atom to an excited level ) are far less frequent that electron collisional ionization and excitation processes .",
    "the radiation densities are low enough in clusters of galaxies for this condition to be met , except possibly for resonant scattering in some strong emission lines with high oscillator strength @xcite .",
    "the second approximation is that the atoms can be treated as if their electrons are all in their ground state rather than having a boltzmann distribution as is common in lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) gases .",
    "this is true if there is a low enough electron and radiation density , so that the excitations that are density dependent are less frequent than the radiative decays , which are quite fast for x - ray energies .",
    "the radiation density is low as discussed above .",
    "this condition is also met for electron densities below @xmath33 for even slowly decaying metastable states .",
    "densities in clusters are at most @xmath34 .",
    "the final approximation is that the plasma is locally relaxed to a maxwellian distribution around a common electron temperature , t. the free electrons and ions are assumed to have obtained a common temperature .",
    "this is only valid if typical dynamical time - scales , such as the time it takes the plasma to cool , is much longer than the time scale for sharing energy between electrons and ions , such as the electron recombination time scale or time scale between coulomb collisions .",
    "if this is true , then collional equilibrium is achieved in which ionizations are balanced by recombinations .",
    "this assumption is valid in the cores of cluster , but may break down in the outer regions of clusters where the density is lower and the plasma may still be in the process of ionizing .",
    "one might also worry that this assumption may break down in the cores of clusters if there is a complex multi - phase distribution of plasma temperatures due to thermally unstable pockets of plasma each with their own temperature .",
    "generally if such a situations exists , however , it is likely that each pocket will locally achieve a common temperature .",
    "an electron penetrating a cloud of a different temperature will interact and achieve a maxwellian distribution .",
    "it is only with complex and rapidly mixed interfaces that the time scale of injection of a new cloud is much shorter than @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the electron velocity , and @xmath37 is the electron mean free path , that the collisional equilibrium would be violated .",
    "the fraction of atoms at a given charge state is determined by a balance of ionizations and recombinations .",
    "the exact balance is fixed by a coupled set of differential equations that relate the ionization and recombination processes between neighboring charge states .",
    "the equations are of the form ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the electron number density , @xmath40 is the density of atoms in the @xmath41th charge state , @xmath42 is the ionization rate out of the @xmath41th charge state , and @xmath43 is the recombination rate out of the @xmath41th state . we have ignored spatial diffusion of the ionization balance .",
    "note , that it is customary to express the density of a given ion relative to the number density of hydrogen , @xmath44 .",
    "we then define @xmath45 as the relative abundance and the fraction of atoms in a given charge state as @xmath46 .",
    "then we have , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 drops out of the above equations .",
    "collisional equilibrium assumes that a steady - state has been achieved , so that the left hand side is set to zero .",
    "the equations therefore simplify to equations of the form ,    @xmath49    collisional equilibrium will eventually be achieved if a plasma remains undisturbed for a long enough period of time ( i.e. , the inverse of the recombination rate ) .",
    "several calculations have been done to determine this ionization balance as a function of the electron temperature @xcite .",
    "one such calculation is shown in figure  [ fig : ionabund ] .",
    "the charge state abundance ( elemental abundance times fraction ionic abundance ) of various ions as a function of temperature .",
    "the top panel shows helium - like and hydrogen - like charge states of various low z atoms .",
    "the bottom panel shows iron ions having the outer electron in the k , l , and m shell .",
    "the bottom panel indicates how the measurement of various ions in the iron series is a sensitive probe of whether plasma at a given temperature exists .",
    "figure uses data from . ]",
    "once the ionization balance is determined the x - ray spectrum can be calculated by considering the various radiation processes .",
    "the most important processes are bremsstrahlung and the k and l shell transitions for the discrete line emission .",
    "when hydrogen is ionized above temperatures of @xmath50 k , copious amounts of bremsstrahlung emission are produced .",
    "bremsstrahlung radiation results from the accelerations of the free electrons in the coulomb field of an ion .",
    "the spectrum is roughly independent of energy below the energy equal to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the electron temperature and @xmath25 is boltzmann s constant . a rough approximation of the power per energy per volume radiated by bremsstrahlung is given by the equation below , @xmath53 where @xmath39 is the electron density , @xmath44 is the hydrogen density , @xmath54 is the photon energy , @xmath25 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath26 is the electron temperature in kelvin .",
    "the total power radiated is therefore , @xmath55 in addition to bremsstrahlung , bound - free emission ( the capture of a free electron to a bound state ) and two - photon emission ( which occurs most frequently following a collisional excitation of hydrogen to the 2s level ) are also significant source of continuum radiation .",
    "they both modify the shape of the continuum emission .",
    "discrete line emission is formed by a number of atomic processes .",
    "such line emission is the most important tool for the x - ray spectroscopist .",
    "the most important atomic processes are collisional excitation , radiative recombination , dielectronic recombination , and resonant excitation .",
    "generally , the processes have been incorporated in a number of publically available and well - tested codes that are used to study collisionally - ionized spectra .",
    "the strength of an emission line is determined by the excitation and recombination rates , which are proportional to the integral of the velocity times the cross - section for a particular process over a maxwellian distribution .",
    "the volume emissivity for a given emission line is calculated by equations of the form ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the rate of inner shell ionization processes , @xmath58 is the sum of collisional excitation processes , and @xmath59 is the sum of recombination processes .",
    "several well tested codes have been developed to calculate the emergent spectrum by assuming an ionization calculation and including a set of excitation and recombinations rates .",
    "these include the raymond - smith @xcite , meka @xcite , mekal @xcite , and apec codes @xcite .",
    "these codes are compilations of the results of more detailed atomic codes , which solve the dirac equation either by the distorted wave approximation @xcite or r - matrix methods @xcite . the number of transitions and the accuracy of the detailed processes limits the results .",
    "extensive laboratory work has been applied to verify wavelengths @xcite and cross - sections @xcite of the transitions .",
    "a number of common spectral transitions occur in most x - ray spectra .",
    "in fact , despite the complexity implied by the above discussion there are usually only a couple of dozen strong transitions that are used to determine most of the information that can be extracted from the x - ray spectrum .",
    "several of the important emission line blends are shown in table 1 .",
    "@xmath60    note this line transition list is somewhat crude since we have chosen to tabulate line blends rather than actual transitions , but matches well with the quality of the observations .",
    "the temperature range is calculated to roughly show the temperature range where the emissivity of a given ion blend is within an order of magnitude of its peak emissivity .",
    "the x - ray cooling function is calculated by integrating the emission from all processes and weighting by the energy of the photons .    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the energy dependent line power ( or continuum power ) .",
    "the cooling function relates the total amount of energy emitted per volume for a given amount of plasma with a given temperature and emissivity .",
    "the cooling function has been compiled in various tables @xcite .     to @xmath63 k",
    "is dominated by bremsstrahlung at high temperatures as well as significant contribution from line emission at lower temperatures . below @xmath64",
    "k in the uv temperature range , the cooling function rises significantly . ]    the relative distribution of plasma at a set of temperatures is often expressed in terms of an emission measure distribution .",
    "the differential emission measure , @xmath65 is defined by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the energy - dependent emissivity and the integral is over all temperatures .",
    "it is also convenient to express the distribution of plasma temperatures in terms of the differential luminosity , which is defined by    @xmath68      the cooling time of an optically - thin plasma is the gas enthalpy divided by the energy lost per unit volume of the plasma .",
    "the gas enthalpy is @xmath69 and the energy lost per volume is the electron density squared times the cooling function .",
    "the cooling time can then be written as ,    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the age of the universe ( 13.7 gyr ) , @xmath72 is the temperature in units of @xmath63 k , @xmath73 is the cooling function in units of @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the density in units of @xmath76 particles @xmath77 .",
    "we used the gas enthalpy per volume , @xmath69 instead of the thermal energy per volume @xmath78 since the plasma is compressed as it cools which therefore effectively raises its heat capacity by a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , x - ray plasma with gas density above @xmath80 has had sufficient time to cool . in the cores of cooling clusters",
    "the cooling time approaches cooling times below @xmath81 .",
    "if the gas was undisturbed , it would have a chance to cool several times .",
    "note that as gas cools at constant pressure ( due to the weight of overlying gas ) then the rise in density as the temperature drops means that @xmath82 becomes shorter and shorter .",
    "the optical depth for photons of a given wavelength , @xmath83 , is the product of the column density of a particular ion , @xmath84 and the cross - section of a particular process .",
    "the cross - section is a function of energy .",
    "the column density is the line integral of the ion density , @xmath40 , which is a function of the spatial position along the line of sight .",
    "the intracluster medium is , for the most part , optically - thin to its own radiation ( i.e. photons escape once they are emitted without interacting again ) .",
    "photons with energies close to certain resonance transitions , however , can scatter several times before leaving a cluster .",
    "the optical depth to a resonance transition is given by    @xmath85    where @xmath40 is the ion density , @xmath46 is the oscillator strength of the transition , @xmath86 is the electron mass , @xmath87 is the wavelength of the transition , @xmath88 is the speed of light , @xmath89 is the electron charge , and @xmath90 is the line width given by ,    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the atomic mass number , @xmath93 is the mean mass per particle , @xmath94 is the mach number of the turbulence or gas motions in the plasma , @xmath25 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath26 is the temperature .",
    "the above expression includes both the thermal broadening of the line as well as turbulent broadening .",
    "if a significant quantity of lowly ionized matter exists along the line of sight , x - rays can be absorbed and re - emitted at lowly ionized longer wavelengths .",
    "this situation occurs frequently for absorption from neutral gas in the milky way galaxy , but could also occur from gas trapped in the cluster potential .",
    "this subject is discussed in detail later , but we note that understanding the role of absorption often has a significant effect on the interpretation of the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "this is particularly true at low resolution .",
    "helium k shell absorption at low energies and oxygen k shell absorption at 23.5 @xmath95 are the largest contributors to the opacity from a neutral absorber and produce absorption edge features in the spectrum",
    ".      the plasma of the intracluster medium can be described by magneto - hydrodynamics on large scales .",
    "several assumptions underlie this statement .",
    "first , the icm is optically - thin so we do not have to include radiative forces in the theory .",
    "second , we assume the icm is non - relativistic .",
    "this is true since the sound speed is at most a few thousand kilometers per second .",
    "third , we assume the icm is nearly fully - ionized , which is true since hydrogen consitutes most of the plasma .",
    "finally , the plasma can be treated as a fluid using continuous fields if the plasma parameter is small so that collective processes dominate .",
    "the plasma parameter is defined by    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the debye length , @xmath24 is the density in units of @xmath77 , and @xmath26 is the temperature in k. the icm plasma parameter is in fact extremely small .",
    "magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) in this context is described by the following variables : the fluid velocity , @xmath98 , the temperature , @xmath26 , the density , @xmath23 , and the magnetic field , @xmath99 , and the dark matter density , @xmath100 .",
    "these quantities are related to one another by the full set of mhd equations , which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium of these quantities .",
    "the transport properties of the fluid can be written in terms of the viscosity , @xmath101 , conductivity , @xmath102 , and resistivity , @xmath103 .",
    "we also adopt the following notation .",
    "t is the energy per particle ; whereas @xmath104 is the temperature in kelvin .",
    "they are related to one another by the relation , @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath25 is boltzmann s constant , the mass of the proton is @xmath106 , and the mean mass per particle is @xmath32 .",
    "additionally , the cooling luminosity is usually defined in terms of the electron , @xmath39 and hydrogen , @xmath44 , number densities , which are related to the fluid mass density by , @xmath107 .    below are the 5 mhd equations .    the first equation , the mass conservation equation , is a statement that the total mass of the fluid is constant .",
    "the second equation , the navier - stoker equation , enforces momentum conservation .",
    "this equation relates the momentum of the fluid ( left hand side ) to the gravitational compression ( first term on the right hand side ) , the thermal and magnetic pressure gradients ( second and third term ) , tangetial magnetic transport ( fourth term ) , and viscous forces ( last terms ) .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field follows the induction equation , the third equation .",
    "the first term on the right hand side generates the magnetic field due to plasma motion , and the final term dissipates the magnetic flux due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "the energy equation , the fourth equation , expresses the balance between heating and cooling terms .",
    "the left hand side describes the energy content of the plasma ( first and second term ) as well as its compression ( third term ) .",
    "the right hand side contains a conduction term ( first term ) , a magnetic dissipation term ( second term ) , viscous heating terms ( third and fourth term ) , and the energy lost due to radiative cooling .",
    "in addition , this equation could include interactions between this plasma and other matter , such as dust , cosmic rays , or dark matter .",
    "finally , the gravitational field is set by the fifth equation where both the dark matter and plasma contribute to the gravitational field .",
    "the transport coefficients for the intracluster medium is the subject of much theoretical work .",
    "the values of these coefficients for a ionized plasma with no magnetic field was worked out by using kinetic theory .",
    "these values are given by :    a tangled magnetic field due to mhd turbulence , e.g. , could modify these coefficient considerably and there has been considerable debate in this subject @xcite .",
    "we will return to this subject in later sections .",
    "the radiative cooling time in the cores of at least two thirds of low redshift @xcite and moderate redshift @xcite clusters is less than 10  gyr and for one third it is less than about 3  gyr .",
    "the energy loss is directly due to the observed x - ray emission with no major bolometric correction .",
    "if there is no heating to compensate the cooling then a cooling flow occurs in these regions . in order to understand what the cooling - flow problem is , why heating is required , how a residual flow might operate and what happens when heating is not operating , we now briefly examine cooling flows .",
    "the radiative cooling time @xmath82 at tens of kpc radius in a cluster always exceeds the gravitational dynamical time so cooling leads to a slow , subsonic inflow there .",
    "the flow causes the density to rise and so maintain the pressure , which is determined by the weight of the overlying gas .",
    "we can simplify the mhd equations significantly for the simple case of an unmagnetized single - phase subsonic flow .",
    "we also ignore any terms with conduction , viscosity , and resistivity .",
    "if we simplify the previous equations and rewrite the lhs of the energy equation based on the mass equation ,    we now assume a spherical geometry and assume that the system is in a steady - state such that the partial time derivatives can be ignored , and assume that the flow is subsonic , then terms of order @xmath108 can be ignored .",
    "we combine the second equation with the third , and define @xmath109 in the first equation , and obtain ,    when the gravitational field is important , then the temperature approaches a critical solution which follows the gravitational potential @xcite as can be seen from the hydrostatic equation for a power law solution .",
    "essentially the flow settles down to a temperature profile close to the local virial one . in an nfw",
    "@xcite potential where the inner power - law part has dark matter mass density varying as @xmath110 this means @xmath111 .",
    "the temperature then flattens to @xmath112 within the inner @xmath113 10  kpc where the gravitational potential of the central galaxy , assume isothermal , dominates .",
    "the temperature finally collapses at the center , before which the flow may go supersonic ( the inertial velocity term is then needed in the above momentum equation ) . over most of the region",
    "@xmath114 as seen in the energy equation , which varies as @xmath115 for bremsstrahlung . using the mass flow equation to substitute for @xmath116 , @xmath117 in the nfw case which leads to a steeper surface brightness profile ( the emissivity is proportional to @xmath118 ) than observed .",
    "even with the king potential commonly used before the 1990s , it was realized that the central surface brightness was too steep to match the observed profiles @xcite .",
    "interpreted as a cooling flow , the data indicated that the mass flow rate increased with radius ( roughly as @xmath119 out to the cooling radius @xmath120 where @xmath121 ) .",
    "such a situation requires that matter is cooling out over a range of radii , which was explained by gas with a range of densities and thus cooling times occurring at a given radius .",
    "therefore , more generic models than a simplified spherical single phase flow had to be considered .",
    "the above discussion of single phase flows says little about what happens on small scales .",
    "in particular , when cooling begins and what size perturbation leads to the largest growth rate and whether the multiphase flows could develop like the data seemed to indicate are an open question .",
    "there has also considerable effort to understand whether the reservoir of heat in the outer regions of clusters can be transferred to the center , which could effectively stabilize any initially thermally unstable parcels of gas",
    ".    originally discussed the origin of thermal instability due to the emission of radiation .",
    "he found that for all x - ray temperatures the gas is thermally unstable and the growth rate is fastest on the smallest scales .",
    "he further found that the small scale perturbations are damped by conduction so that the growth rates will be faster on somewhat larger scales .",
    "a number of authors @xcite studied thermal instability in the context of gravitational field . noted that some of the thermal instability arguments are inapplicable in a cluster gravitational potential .",
    "it is possible that overdense parcels of plasma can come to equilibrium at a lower adiabat deep in the potential @xcite .",

    "later confirmed these instabilities but stressed the importance of inefficient conduction for these conditions .",
    "however a particular , and not explained , spectrum of density perturbations is required to obtain the inferred relation @xmath122 @xcite . argues that multiphase flows do not occur in real clusters .",
    "the standard multiphase model simplifies the physics of the flow by assuming that radiative cooling dominates the flow and then looking at the relative amount of radiation emitted at each temperature over the cooling flow volume .",
    "this can be seen as a starting point to testing the idea that cooling flows are operating in the cores of clusters .",
    "if we restore equation [ eqn : energy ] to the full time - derivative form and then integrate over volume and neglect any heating or additional cooling we obtain ,    @xmath123    we define a mass loss rate per time , @xmath109 , and a differential x - ray luminosity , @xmath124 , according to    @xmath125    then the equation  [ eqn : smcf1 ] simplifies to ,    @xmath126    this can be rewritten as ,    @xmath127    in general , @xmath128 will be set by the local gravitational field and magnetic pressure .",
    "if the gravitational field is relatively smooth as can be expected in dark matter haloes , then the pressure will remain nearly constant in small regions that will begin cooling .",
    "whether this occurs depends on the development of thermal instability as discussed in the previous section . if @xmath128 term is small , this expression simplifies to    @xmath129    which is known as the standard isobaric cooling flow model .",
    "if the density is constant which would result from high magnetic pressure , it alternatively reduces to    @xmath130    which is for isochoric cooling .",
    "an adiabatic equation would result if cooling were ineffective and the gravitational potential was strong and the left hand side would be zero . in general , @xmath128 could be quite complicated , but note that it is fairly well established observationally that over the whole cooling flow volume the temperature derivative , @xmath131 is positive and the pressure derivative is negative , @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the last term is likely to be positive , and the relative amount of x - ray luminosity would be emitted according to somewhere in between the previous two equations if x - ray radiative cooling dominated the energy release .",
    "note that equation  [ eqn : fullcflowmodel ] is just the first law of thermodynamics ( @xmath133 ) differentiated with respect to time ( @xmath134 ) with x - ray cooling as the only heat loss term .",
    "equation  [ eqn : isobaric ] is also frequently expressed in terms of the emission measure ,    @xmath135    this then can be used in conjunction with the atomic physics necessary to produce an x - ray spectrum as shown in figure  [ fig : cflowmodel ] , which can be compared with the data .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy has demonstrated that this model is incomplete and therefore we have most likely neglected additional heating or possibly cooling in our derivation of this model .",
    "the following section describes the instrumentation and analysis necessary to test it .    the standard isobaric cooling - flow model . the model is produced by summing collisionally - ionized x - ray spectra within a temperature range such that the relative amount of luminosity per temperature interval is a constant .",
    "this model predicts relatively prominent iron l shell transitions between 10 and 17 @xmath95 that arise from a wide range of temperatures .",

    "the fe l complex most strongly constrains the distribution of temperatures . merely detecting or not detecting an emission line from a given charge state from a given ion , places narrow constraints on the distributions of temperatures in the plasma .",
    "the required resolution to resolve lines from individual fe l ions is about 100 at 1 kev .",
    "most x - ray detectors , which historically have been either proportional counters or solid - state devices , have been unable to achieve this resolution and therefore the fe l complex appears as an unresolved bump in the spectrum .",
    "proportional counters work by the incoming x - ray being photoelectrically absorbed an inert gas atom followed by the measurement of the electrical discharge induced by the cascade auger electrons and the further release of fluorescent x - rays .",
    "they typically achieve resolution near 20% .",
    "ccd devices work by the x - ray creating a photo - electron in the silicon , which creates a electron - hole pair cascade through ionization .",
    "the electrons drift to a set of surface contacts due to an electric field and the number of electrons is used to measure the energy of the incident x - ray .",
    "these typically have resolving powers near 10 or 20 at 1 kev .",
    "these devices can , however , measure an average temperature accurately from the shape of the continuum , which is sensitive to the bremsstrahlung emission , or from the centroid of the fe l complex .",
    "these instruments , however , have difficulty contraining the _ distribution _ of temperatures composing a single spectrum .    dispersive instruments , which either use a grating or crystal , have achieved high spectral resolution in the fe l band .",

    "both the reflection grating spectrometers on xmm - newton , and the focal plane crystal spectrometer on the einstein observatory produced high resolution x - ray spectra of clusters . future missions may include non - dispersive microcalorimeters , which use the temperature change of a cryogenically - cooled absorber due to the photo - electron to measure the energy of the x - ray .",

    "effective area and exposure time : * the effective collecting area and the exposure time of the observation determine the number of photons collected .",
    "the number of photons enters into the effectiveness of the observation in a number of ways .",
    "typically , tens of thousands of photons are collected in a given observation .",
    "hundred of photons are necessary to make any detailed surface brightness image . thousands of photons are necessary to make detailed spectroscopic measurements of the temperature .",
    "tens of thousands of photons are necessary to make detailed measurements of elemental abundances as well as the construction of the differential emission measure .",
    "* field of view : * field of view determines the fraction of photons from a cluster that are detected .",
    "often , the field of view has been smaller than the sizes of typical nearby clusters and therefore are an important factor in comparing results from different instruments .    * spectral bandpass : * the spectral bandpass of most x - ray instruments has been quite large and for the most part encompassed most of the x - ray spectral band .",
    "most of the photons from clusters of galaxies are emitted below 2 kev , and most instruments have had high efficiency at these energies .",
    "* angular resolution : * angular resolution is an important factor for spatially - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "xmm - newton ( with fwhm of 6  ) and chandra ( with fwhm of 0.5  ) , for example , have been able to perform spatially - resolved photometry on kiloparsec scales for nearby clusters .",
    "analysis techniques play a vital role in the interpretation of x - ray spectra from clusters of galaxies .",
    "the data analysis is usually quite complex compared to the techniques that can be applied to data from unresolved sources .",
    "in addition , the instrument response functions are actually quite complex , and therefore the application of these functions is usually problematic and results often are somewhat model dependent .",
    "x - ray photons that are recorded in detectors after being reflected and dispersed by optics have three quantities that are measured : two detector coordinates , @xmath138 and @xmath139 and one energy measurement , @xmath22 .",
    "these are indirectly related to the position of the photon on the sky , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and the photon s intrinsic energy , @xmath89 . for dispersive spectrometers",
    "the relationship between these three variables and their detector counterparts are very indirect and the full convolution has to be considered . for non - dispersive spectrometers ,",
    "the relationship is more direct so approximations can be used .",
    "for example , it is customary to assume that @xmath142 when extracting a spectrum to perform spatially - resolved spectro - photometry or to assume that @xmath143 to construct an image .",
    "the detection probability , @xmath144 , for a photon emitted from solid angle position , @xmath145 and energy , @xmath89 with measured values of detector coordinates ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) and ccd pulseheight @xmath22 is given by    @xmath146    where @xmath147 is the spatially - varying spectral source model and @xmath148 is the instrument response function .",

    "one can easily see some of the reasons for confusing results on spectra from clusters of galaxies .",
    "it is often somewhat ill - defined by what one analysis would mean when compared to an analysis from a different instrument without specifying the full source function , @xmath147 .",
    "note that most analyses construct a response matrix and an ancillary response file , which are used in spectral codes like xspec @xcite or spex @xcite .",
    "these codes multiply a source spectrum on a grid by the response matrix , which relates the input spectrum to the model observed spectrum .",
    "the model observed spectrum can be compared to the real data by statistical tests , typically a binned @xmath149 calculation .",
    "the response matrix ( @xmath150 ) /ancillary response ( @xmath92 ) file approach is a simplification of the response function above by assuming the following separation ,    @xmath151    where @xmath92 is constructed separately for each spectrum depending on the spatial position ( @xmath152 ) of the photons being studied .",
    "this approach may or may not be appropriate for a particular analysis .",
    "the source function is in turn related to the function in equation 7 in  3.1.5 differentiated with respect to spatial coordinates .",
    "@xmath153    where @xmath154 is the differential emission measure per solid angle .",
    "this function is the true observable if the plasma is assumed to be in collisional equilibrium .",
    "note that if a given patch of the sky is assumed to be isothermal this will directly give a measurement of the density , since the volume element can be related to the angular coordinate @xmath155 for an assumed source distance , assuming some geometry to obtain the depth .",
    "the temperature structure in clusters is never completely isothermal , so a variety of temperatures will be sampled along the line of sight .",
    "we will not review all work in dealing with these data analysis problems , but refer to the individual work in the following section for more details since it can vary considerably between authors .",
    "a wealth of information has been collected by a number of x - ray satellites on cooling core clusters .",
    "recently , there have been some strict tests to various aspects of the cooling - flow scenario .",
    "we review many of the previous spectroscopic and imaging results that led to the formation of the cooling - flow model for cluster thermal evolution .",
    "we then discuss how high resolution x - ray spectroscopic results have questioned a number of assumptions in the interpretation of the previous work .",
    "these observations have largely galvanized support around the idea that the thermodynamic evolution of cluster of galaxies is considerably different than was previously thought .",
    "we then review some recent x - ray imaging and spectro - photometric work that has left some clues to the resolution of the cooling - flow problem .",
    "finally in this section , we define the structure of the cooling - flow problem in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the cooling time of the icm is less than the hubble time at the centers of many clustes as demonstrated by with the uhuru mission .",
    "imaging observations established the existence of sharp surface brightness peaks in some cluster of galaxies . these surface brightness peaks and short cooling times",
    "were interpreted as strong evidence for the existence of cooling flows .",
    "the existence of sharp surface brightness peaks were found by the copernicus satellite @xcite , rocket missions @xcite , and sas-3 @xcite .",
    "later missions established the widespread nature of the phenomenon by establishing that approximately 50% of all clusters contained sharp surface brightness profiles .",
    "the einstein observatory @xcite , exosat observatory @xcite , and rosat observatories @xcite confirmed this picture with observations of hundreds of nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "considerable work was done to establish the implied mass deposition rates from the cooling flows @xcite .",
    "the mass deposition rates , @xmath156 , were estimated to be between 1 - 10 solar mass per year for a giant elliptical galaxy and 100 - 1000 solar masses per year for the largest clusters of galaxies . a first order estimate of the mass deposition rate is simply made by taking the total gas mass calculated from the density profile and dividing that by the cooling time at the edge of the region .",
    "alternatively , this can be written as the luminosity of the cooling flow volume divided by the temperature ( in units of kt ) times the mean mass per particle .",
    "more detailed calculations take into account the work done on the gas by its compression in the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "generally , this effect is thought to reduce the overall level of mass cooling by at most a factor of two from the amount predicted without gravitational compression @xcite .",
    "the modeling of the x - ray spectra of cooling clusters has become considerably more mature in 30 years .",
    "in addition , some of the early work with cooling - flow models has now been discounted .",
    "this work exemplifies the difficulty in applying models at low spectral resolution .",
    "we briefly discuss some of the major changes to modeling the x - ray spectrum of cooling clusters .",
    "the areil - v satellite established that the emission from clusters of galaxies was thermal ( i.e. likely in collisional equilibrium ) by detecting the emission lines from the fe k@xmath157 blend ( fe xxv he@xmath157 , fe xxvi ly@xmath157 ) from the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "previously , there were arguments for the origin of the x - ray emission from clusters as either inverse compton scattering of microwave background photons off relativistic electrons or emission from a collection of unresolved x - ray binaries .",
    "the detection of thermal emission , however , established that the hot gas was trapped in the dark matter potential and emitted at a temperature close to what was expected from the velocity distribution of member galaxies .",
    "after the thermal model was established , hundreds , if not thousands , of clusters had their `` mean '' temperature measured with solid state detectors or proportional counters most frequently on the einstein , exosat , beppo - sax , and asca observatories .",
    "this work established relationships between many observables in clusters . in particular , relationships between temperature and luminosity @xcite , mass @xcite , and entropy @xcite indicate that mean cluster gas properties roughly follow from what is expected from self - similar gravitational collapse . there may be some deviation from these relations , more preferentially in lower mass clusters indicating the importance of non - gravitational processes in cluster formation and evolution .",
    "it was discovered quite early that many clusters do not have an isothermal structure @xcite and have softer x - ray spectra in the core .",
    "this implies lower mean temperatures .",
    "a number of more complicated spectral models were later used to represent the x - ray emission from cooling - flows with exosat , einstein , beppo - sax , and asca observations .",
    "two temperature models were used by a number of authors to represent the distribution of temperatures in the cores of clusters @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the cold gas in the cores of cluster was developed by where the dark matter halo of the cd galaxy is responsible for an unmixed icm component .",
    "others used the cooling flow model discussed in  3.3 modified by an absorber .",
    "the absorber was necessary to reduce the soft x - ray emission at low energies observed by .",
    "in retrospect it is clear that these observations were demonstrating a lack of emission at low energies relative to the cooling flow model , although this was not explicitly stated .",
    "in particular , the relatively low spectral resolution made it difficult to distinguish between models .",
    "the absorber in these models was modelled typically as a single absorbing screen @xcite .",
    "the screen was placed between the cluster and the observer , but the assumption was that this absorption was representing cold gas in the center of the cluster .",
    "the absorption typically had column densities near @xmath158 , which would have implied large quantities of cold molecular gas if it was distributed uniformly .",
    "initial attempts to find this quantity of gas were unsuccessful @xcite , although considerable cold material has since been found by and .",
    "another model used was a cooling flow model with a single absorption edge .",
    "the absorption edge had an energy near 0.7 kev , which could have been from ionized oxygen possibly from warm ( @xmath159 k ) material @xcite or dust @xcite .",
    "later , high resolution reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) observations demonstrated that the single edge model mimicked the effect of lack of emission from colder fe ions .",
    "it is interesting to note , in particular , that the fitted energy of the single absorption edge was slightly lower than the 3s-2p transitions of fe xvii , and would therefore optimally appear to absorb cooler emission from the standard cooling flow model .",
    "many observations generally established the cooling time is a fraction of a gyr in relaxed clusters .",
    "they also clearly indicated that the temperature was lower where the central surface brightness was highest .",
    "these two fact are now shown clearly with recent data from the chandra observatory in figure  [ fig : tcool ] and [ fig : tvsr ] .",
    "the first high resolution observations of cooling clusters comes from the focal plane crystal spectrometer ( fpcs ) on the einstein observatory .",
    "this instrument used a crystal to disperse x - rays according to the bragg condition .",
    "it therefore could produce a high resolution spectrum by scanning in angle and therefore scanning in wavelength .",
    "this worked for an extended source like a cluster as well .",
    "unfortunately , there were only a limited number of these observations and the count rates were not particularly high .",
    "these observations demonstrated the existence of line emission from 8 ions @xcite in four different clusters .",
    "some of these observations are contradicted by reflection grating spectrometer observations as will be described in the next section , so it is likely that these observations were partially compromised by high background rates and , in some cases , relatively few photon counts .",
    "observations made at high spectral resolution with the reflection grating spectrometers on xmm - newton have greatly clarified the observational interpretation of the soft x - ray spectra of cooling clusters . although some information can be gained from the exact shape of the fe l complex with low spectral resolution spectrometers , rgs observations resolve emission lines from each fe l charge state ( fe xxiv through fe xvii ) and therefore can place crucial constraints of the amount of gas present between temperatures of 0.4 and 4 kev .",

    "it is shown that hot clusters ( 5 - 10 kev ) generally only show evidence of fe xxiv - xxii emission and no other fe l charge states .",
    "intermediate temperature clusters ( 2 - 5 kev ) show evidence for fe xxiv - fe xix emission , but no fe xvii and fe xviii .",
    "the coolest clusters and groups ( less than 2 kev ) show evidence of the entire fe l series but anomalously low levels of fe xvii emission when compared with the standard cooling flow model .",
    "all of these observations are in contradiction with the standard cooling flow model , and suggest qualitatively that the model is violated at characteristically a fraction of the temperature and is more inconsistent with the model at lower temperatures .    in this quantitative analysis @xcite ,",
    "the cooling flow model was separated into four different temperature ranges as shown in figure  [ fig:4range ] .",
    "then the normalization of each temperature range was adjusted to empirically fit the spectrum shown in figures  [ fig : spec1 ] , [ fig : spec2 ] , and [ fig : spec3 ] .",
    "the results from this study are shown in figures  [ fig : dldt1 ] and [ fig : dldt2 ] .",
    "these graphs plot each of the four luminosity detections for each clusters .",
    "the lines connect the points that are actual spectral detections and not just upper limits .",
    "the standard cooling flow model would be if all the points would lie on a horizontal line .",
    "a comparison of figure [ fig : dldt1 ] and [ fig : dldt2 ] suggests that when plotting the differential luminosity vs. the fraction of the temperature as in figure [ fig : dldt2 ] , that the trend is more systematic .",
    "therefore , the emission of a cooling flow is consistent with a power law in differential luminosity with exponent between 1 and 2 .",
    "the cooling flow model , however , is strongly ruled out in many systems .    at this point",
    ", there has been no significant evidence for any significant difference between cooling flows of similar cluster mass .",
    "this poses some challenges for heating models where there is a time - dependence to the process .",
    "there also has been no evidence from x - ray spectroscopy that there are significant quantities of plasma at low x - ray temperatures above the expectation of the cooling flow model . in other words ,",
    "figure [ fig : dldt2 ] shows a monotonically decreasing violation of the cooling flow model and no evidence for gas piling up at some intermediate temperature .",
    "this presents some challenges for continuous heating model that do not reheat the gas completely . for both of these reasons ,",
    "it is not straight - forward to interpret these results in the context of any heating model regardless of the mechanism .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that these results generally are displaying the x - ray spectrum of the entire cooling flow volume .",
    "there is considerable work that is continuing to actually study the changes in the emission spectrum as a function of spatial position inside the cooling flow .",
    "these studies are difficult since determining a spatially - resolve differential emission measure require both high angular resolution and high spectral resolution . following , we discuss some attempts to study the spatial - dependence of the x - ray emission of cooling flow at moderate spectral resolution .",
    "the rgs results obtained at high spectral resolution have been augmented with further studies at low resolution that attempt to study the spatial distribution in greater detail @xcite . in general , it has also been demonstrated that the low spectral resolution observations obtained with xmm - epic and chandra , which are far more numerous , are generally consistent with the rgs observations . significantly smaller mass deposition rates have been measured when the cooling flow model has been applied . similarly , cut - off cooling flow models have been shown to be consistent with the data . needless to say",
    ", a larger range of models can be applied to the low resolution data and still be statistically consistent with the data . in general , it appears that there is no strong evidence for any significant amount of cold gas ( below @xmath160 of the maximum temperature ) in any cluster .",

    "cold fronts show that there are vast quantities of plasma oscillating with respect to the gravitational potential",

    "the flow behind the standing shock in an accreting white dwarf involves the same physical processes as those expected for a cooling flow in a cluster although the geometry may be different .",
    "although there are a great number of differences between clusters of galaxies and cataclysmic variables , these observations can be used to confidently say there is no mistake in applying a model for a radiative - cooling dominated plasma .",
    "furthermore , this points to no major difficulties in the atomic physics models or subtle problem with the plasma physics arguments we have used .",
    "we now briefly discuss what we believe the cooling flow problem is , and how it might be resolved . clearly , the problem is quite complex and it is difficult not to see the problem in historical terms .",
    ", for example , discussed a difference between the _ soft x - ray cooling - flow problem _ and the _ mass sink cooling - flow problem_. the former refers to the recent discrepancy seen in the soft x - ray spectrum between what was predicted and what was observed .",
    "the latter refers to the difficulty in detecting any by - products in cooling clusters from the hypothesized cooling - flow plasma .",
    "these definitions , however , might just categorize our ignorance of the solution to the problem .",
    "the major difficulty is that : 1 ) the cluster plasma loses energy by emitting the very x - rays we detect , 2 ) efficient and distributed heat sources are difficult to construct , 3 ) the cluster plasma appears to cool _ most _ of the way , but 4 ) evidence for complete cooling is utterly lacking .",
    "the cooling - flow problem as we see it is to understand what happens in the middle of that process . after examining whether cooling flows are ruled out , we discuss many ideas that might alleviate the cooling - flow problem .",
    "note , from fig .  6 , that time variability on intervals longer than @xmath161 can not be the solution .",
    "in summary , problems with the simple cooling flow picture emerged from two fronts .",
    "the first is the enormous implied mass deposition in some objects where for example @xmath162 ( e.g. pks0745 - 191 ; ) which is then not seen in cooled form ( the mass sink problem ) . the central galaxy of this , and many other brightest cluster galaxies where the surrounding gas have @xmath163  gyr , has much excess blue light , optical / uv / ir emission - line nebulosity ( and refs .",
    "therein ) and even molecular gas @xcite . the total star formation rate and gas mass is often one to two orders of magnitude below such a large value of @xmath109 operating for several gyr",
    ". the flow could be somewhat intermittent but not overly so or short central cooling times would not be so common @xcite .",
    "a non - standard imf for the stars is one possibility @xcite , but has to be extreme @xcite .",
    "the second problem is that a simple cooling flow spectrum is a poor fit to the data in the soft x - ray band @xcite .",
    "what was usually done was to fit the model spectrum of an isobaric cooling flow @xcite plus an isothermal spectrum to represent the luminosity from gravitational work done , to the data from the inner regions .",
    "a deficit in soft x - ray emission was found in the data when compared with the model .",
    "this was then modelled as photoelectric absorption due to an absorber intrinsic to the central regions .",
    "the lack of any obvious absorption in very soft rosat spectra was attributed to emission from the intervening gas in the cluster @xcite .",
    "photoelectric absorption intrinsic to the cluster does not however appear in the spectra of the jet in m87 @xcite or the nucleus of ngc 1275 @xcite . nor is it apparent in the detailed xmm / rgs spectra of cool cluster cores @xcite .",
    "absorption has generally been abandoned as an explanation , although no detailed test has been made of a model in which the absorption is intimately linked with the coolest cooling gas clouds .",
    "note though that the presence of warm emission - line nebulosities , dust - lanes and clear optical absorption lines @xcite show that at some level there _ must _ be distributed intrinsic absorption .",
    "curiously , the missing soft x - ray luminosity ( i.e. the above soft x - ray deficit ) is close to the luminosity emitted from the emission - line nebulosity commonly found in these systems @xcite .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the gas _ is _ cooling but not radiatively once its temperature has dropped to @xmath164 or so .",
    "it can be cooled by mixing @xcite or conduction @xcite with cold gas .",
    "a possible picture would be that the gas cools from 100 to within 20  kpc radiatively as a single - phase flow by which radius its temperature has dropped by a few .",
    "it then shares its temperature with cooler gas and thereby rapidly drops down to below @xmath165 .",
    "the cooler gas is close to the peak of the cosmic cooling curve and radiates the energy in the uv and optical bands ( and ir if there is molecular gas and dust ) .",
    "such a solution to the soft x - ray deficit still suffers from the mass sink problem .",
    "a further situation which could give a soft x - ray deficit is if the metals in the icm are highly inhomogeneous .",
    "they are presumably introduced in a very localized manner and at high abundance by stars and supernovae . if they do not mix but after time just reside at a similar temperature to their surroundings then when bremsstrahlung cooling dominates ( which it does above about 1  kev for solar abundances ) then all the gas cools together .",
    "but when it has cooled so that line cooling dominates , the highly enriched clumps would then cool rapidly and drop out @xcite .",
    "this has been considered in part by , although no conclusive test has been performed .",
    "the main reason that complete cooling flows , in which gas cools from the cluster virial temperature to well below @xmath165 , are often now considered to be ruled out is the high spectral resolution xmm / rgs data @xcite .",
    "chandra spectra lead to a similar conclusion @xcite .",
    "these spectra have been covered in depth earlier in this review . we summarize here to note that most data are consistent with the icm temperature dropping within the cooling radius by a factor of about 3 ( sometimes significantly larger values",
    "are found e.g. a2597 @xcite and centaurus @xcite .",
    "data from all wavelengths are consistent with a residual flow ranging from a few @xmath166 to atypical value of tens @xmath166 up to @xmath167 in some cases ( e.g. ; ; ) .",
    "these values are generally compatible with the ongoing star formation seen .",
    "the brightest galaxy in x - ray peaked clusters often has excess blue light indicating massive star formation and ir / optical / uv emission lines @xcite .",
    "the regions are often dusty so the determination of the star formation rate depends on uncertin dust corrections",
    ". it can be tens @xmath166 to about 100  @xmath166 in the case of a1835 . in a typical bcg it is one to ten per cent of the mass cooling rate inferred from the hotter x - ray emitting gas assuming it cools completely .",
    "uv - excess bcgs probably have the highest rate of star formation of early - type galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "the brightest galaxy in non - x - ray - peaked clusters do not have this emission .",
    "the excitation of the emission - line nebulosity , which often has a filamentary structure ( e.g. the perseus cluster : : the centaurus cluster : ; the virgo cluster : ) is likely related to the star formation but in detail there are problems .",
    "hotter emission is required than expected from the stars observed and there are no stars obvious within the outer filaments .",
    "the gas , even in the outer filaments , contains dust and molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "simple models for the molecular gas imply higher pressures than for the surrounding gas and very short radiative cooling times @xcite .",
    "the filaments may have been pulled out from a central reservoir of cold and warm gas by the action of radio bubbles @xcite .",
    "where the central gas comes from is not clear although radiative cooling is likely .",
    "a residual cooling flow is therefore taking place in many clusters .",
    "gas at intermediate temperatures of about @xmath168 is seen through ovi emission with fuse .",
    "found such emission from a2597 and recently it has been found in a426 and a1795 @xcite .",
    "the inferred cooling rates in the 30 arcsec fuse aperture are @xmath169 .",
    "some heating is always expected in the central regions of clusters .",
    "examples are supernovae @xcite , an active central nucleus @xcite and many more recent papers cited in sec 7.27.5 ) , conduction @xcite and many more recent papers cited in sec 7.1 ) .",
    "a problem with heating the gas is that the cooling rate is proportional to the density squared whereas most heating processes are proportional to volume .",
    "this tends to make the gas unstable and means generally that the cooler denser gas will carry on cooling while hotter surrounding gas heats up .",
    "the gas appears to cool by about a factor of three and then stop cooling . a mechanism to do that is not obvious , since the gas does not appear to be piling up at the lower temperature .",
    "indeed it seems that the gas temperature profile is `` frozen '' and has been so for some gyrs @xcite .",
    "the profile of @xmath82 is similar in many clusters with a common central minimum value for @xmath82 of about 200  myr ( fig .",
    "this strongly suggests that heating is continuous , at least on timescales of @xmath161 or more and is spatially distributed .",
    "moreover , no shock waves are apparent in these regions so any mechanical energy injection must be subsonic .",
    "( see also ) provide several 1d simulations of a cluster core in which various levels of heat are injected at various radii .",
    "the results which best fit the temperature profile of a real cluster are those without heating .",
    "this demonstrates that a heating model is not entirely straight - forward .",
    "some authors use a combination of processes .",
    "although several are operating in any cluster , it is unlikely that they have similar weight , especially when it is recalled that the cooling flow problem exists in objects ranging from elliptical galaxies , through groups to the most massive clusters .",
    "it applies to a range of about 100,000 in x - ray luminosity and over 15 in temperature .",
    "we are therefore seeking a wide ranging , quasi - continuous , gentle , distributed heating process    we now consider conduction and agn heating in detail before discussing other models .      the outer cluster atmosphere beyond the cooling radius represents a vast reservoir of thermal energy .",
    "conduction can transfer heat into the cooler central regions .",
    "the rate of conduction is however highly uncertain due to the presence of magnetic fields which are probably tangled .",
    "most workers have adopted spitzer @xcite conductivity ( @xmath170 ) , which is appropriate for an unmagnetized gas , and then assumed a suppression factor @xmath171 .",
    "suggest that @xmath171 is about 1/5 since field lines wander away from each other exponentially when tangled ( see for another discussion ) .",
    "comparison with the data initially looked promising @xcite then under further inspection ruled it out @xcite .",
    "( see also and ) used the density and temperature profiles to deduce the heat transfer rate within the gas and thus the effective conductivity @xmath172 required . for several high temperature clusters , @xmath173 , but for clusters where most of the gas is below 5  kev then @xmath174",
    ". then seems unlikely , however , but this may be possible @xcite .    proposed that turbulent conduction might work , whereby large subsonic eddies cause heat to be transferred in radius .",
    "this does appear to operate fast enough to explain the data @xcite provided the gas is highly turbulent .",
    "we shall return to the issue of turbulence later when discussing heating by the central radio source (  [ sec : radioheating ] ) .",
    "we note that conduction as a solution has a fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "if the gas starts out isothermal , then either the gas cools in which conduction can not stop it ( conduction has a steep positive temperature dependence ) or conduction does work and there is no cool gas . how a profile resembling a cooling flow would occur is difficult to understand .",
    "most central cluster galaxies where @xmath82 in the surrounding gas is less than a few gyr have a nucleus radio source @xcite .",
    "the radio luminosity of these sources has a wide range from the powerful frii objects cygnus  a and 3c295 to weaker fri objects such as m87 .",
    "rosat hri data clearly showed that the fri lobes of 3c84 , the central radio source in the perseus cluster , have displaced the icm and so are strongly interacting there @xcite .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of chandra has revealed further details of that source @xcite and enabled the discovery of many more , similar , interactions .",
    "holes in the x - ray surface brightness coincident with radio lobes are commonly seen and generally referred to as radio bubbles .",
    "they are presumed to be relatively empty of normal thermal gas ( see limits by schmidt et al ) and mostly filled with a plasma consisting of relativistic electrons , protons and magnetic field .",
    "striking examples apart from in the perseus cluster are seen in hydra  a @xcite ; a2052 @xcite ; centaurus @xcite ; m87 @xcite ; a2597 @xcite and many more @xcite .    sometimes outer bubbles are seen ( the nw one in the perseus cluster was first seen in images from the einstein observatory , @xcite which are considered to be ghost lobes .",
    "synchrotron and other losses have depleted the population of radio - emitting electrons to the extent that they are not detectable in the radio ( particularly not at high frequencies ) yet the other electrons , protons and magnetic field in the cavities still exclude the x - ray emitting thermal gas .",
    "weak , low - frequency radio emission pointing at the outer bubbles in the perseus cluster supports this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the bubbles discussed so far have radii from about 1 to 15  kpc .",
    "recently , giant bubbles of radius 100  kpc have been found 100 - 200  kpc from the centers of the hydra - a nucleus @xcite and in ms0735.6 + 7421 @xcite , and some bubbles with little energy ( e.g. ) .",
    "the minimum energy of a bubble can be estimated from its volume @xmath175 and surrounding pressure @xmath176 as @xmath177 . if the interior pressure is entirely relativistic in gas with a ratio of specific heats of 4/3 then @xmath178 .",
    "the energies are significant for typical bubbles @xcite and exceed @xmath179 for the giant bubbles .",
    "bubbles from radio sources were first predicted by gull & northover @xcite and studied analytically before the chandra / xmm - newton era by ( see also ) and simulated by .",
    "they are inflated by jets from the nucleus and typically form in pairs either side of the nucleus and seemingly attached to the nucleus . if a jet of power @xmath180 steadily inflates a bubble of radius @xmath148 then , after an initial supersonic phase and assuming radiative losses are negligible , the bubble expansion with time @xmath181 follows from the conservation of energy as @xmath182 .",
    "thus @xmath183 and the expansion speed of the bubble @xmath184 .",
    "the bubble is of much lower density than its surroundings so is buoyant and rises at a velocity close to the local gravitational free - fall value @xmath185 .",
    "when @xmath186 drops below @xmath185 the bubble detaches from the jet and rises . a new bubble then forms if the jet remains powered .",
    "a simple estimate of the power injected into the bubbles can be obtained by dividing @xmath187 by an estimate of the age of the bubble , which can be obtained from the above scaling ( say , @xmath188 ) @xcite .",
    "these are typically several orders of magnitude higher than the inferred radio luminosity of the jets and nucleus showing that the radio luminosity is a poor guide to the power of a jet .",
    "such radio jets and lobes can have a radiative efficiency ( ratio of observed synchrotron luminosity to mechanical power ) as low as @xmath189 or even @xmath190 .",
    "this , together with time variability of the jets , indicates that the very poor correlation between the radio power of the central source in a cluster and the heating power @xcite does not necessarily imply that the _ mean _ jet power does not correlate well .",
    "the power of the jets is mostly sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the cluster core provided it is steady .",
    "did however note that it is insufficent in some objects .",
    "this could indicate that radio source heating is not a general process or that it can vary by factors of a few on the bubbling timescale , which ranges between @xmath191   myr and @xmath192  myr .",
    "this timescale is still shorter than the inner radiative cooling timescale which is typically 100300  myr .",
    "a further problem they raise is that bubbles were only found in 10 per cent of the clusters they examined , so they either do not occur in many clusters or if they do then they do not occur often .",
    "this result could however be a selection effect from the examination of a sample of clusters mixed in type ( i.e. whether the cooling flow problem applies to that cluster or not ) and signal - to - noise .",
    "a simple inspection by acf of chandra images of the 30 per cent of the 55 brightest clusters in the sky listed by which have central @xmath193  gyr shows that all but one have clear bubbles , so we suspect that bubbles are indeed common enough to be a viable ingredient in the solution to the cooling flow problem . a more detailed analysis of the issue by shows that at least 75 per cent of the cluster cores needing heating have bubbles .",
    "this means that the duty cycle of bubbles is such that they are ( detectably ) present for 75 per cent of the time .    finally , before examining numerical simulations and then the heating mechanism in detail",
    ", we note that the total energy required to stave of cooling for several gyr in a luminous cluster implies a large central black hole mass (; assuming a mass - to - energy conversion effiency of 10 per cent ) .",
    "compared black hole masses predicted by the velocity dispersion relation @xcite and found that they often fall short of what is required .",
    "however for the very few systems where the mass has been measured ( e.g. m87 ) there is no problem .",
    "perhaps the conclusion here would be that massive black holes in cluster cores lie above the @xmath194 relation for lower mass galaxies .",
    "many groups have now carried out numerical hydrodynamical simulations of the behaviour of bubbles in the icm @xcite .",
    "most have been 2d or 3d and use the flash or zeus codes ( see ) for a brief discussion and comparison of many of the simulations ) .",
    "several assume that the surrounding gas is isothermal .",
    "many produce bubbles which are very unstable ( to rayleigh - taylor and kelvin helmholtz instabilities depending on the motion of the bubble at the start of a run ) and collapse once they have risen more than their own height , which is most unlike the observed bubbles . indeed most simulated bubbles do not look like the observed ones .",
    "several of the early simulations relied on the dragging out of cooler gas from the smallest cluster radii by the bubbles as the explanation of why so little cool gas is seen in real clusters .",
    "this explanation however only works over the lifetime of the cluster ( say 5  gyr ) if the cooler gas is dragged out beyond the cooling radius ( i.e well beyond 100  kpc ) , otherwise it either falls back in or mixes in and reduces the cooling time of gas just beyond the center .",
    "a catastrophic cooling flow is only being postponed for a while .",
    "although this explanation can work temporarily it can not provide a comprehensive solution .",
    "when heating is estimated in simulations it is often unclear what it is due to .",
    "some work is done by the buoyant bubbles rising and the sinking of cooler gas .",
    "this is the heating mechanism of the effervescent heating approach of ( see also ) .",
    "@xmath195 work is done as the bubbles are made in the first place .",
    "that energy presumably propagates as a sound wave and need not be dissipated locally unless shocks are involved or the icm is viscous .",
    "heating by a mixture of weak shocks ( at small radii ) and viscous damping of sound waves ( at larger radii ) has been proposed by on the basis of the ripples seen in deep chandra images of the perseus cluster ( see also forman et al 2004 for a discussion of ripples in the virgo cluster ) .",
    "viscosity has been included in simulations by and by reynolds et al .",
    "@xcite and appears to dissipate 2030 per cent of the @xmath195 energy from the bubbles .",
    "transport of the energy by sound waves and dissipating it over a lengthscale of 50100  kpc provides a fairly gentle and distributed source of heat .",
    "the bubbles in a viscous medium also better resemble the observed ones @xcite .    and argue that strong sound waves will shock and heat the innermost region and not deposit energy further out where it is needed .",
    "however a very deep image of the perseus cluster @xcite shows that the shock ( fig .",
    "15 ) is isothermal .",
    "this may indicate that thermal conduction operates at least within the inner parts of the cool region to share the energy released by the bubbling process .",
    "several workers @xcite suggest that the icm is turbulent .",
    "such motions can transport heat and the dissipation of the turbulence is itself a source of heat . have measured brightness and temperature fluctuations in the coma cluster ( which is not a cooling flow cluster ) .",
    "have determined a limited turbulent - like spectrum in the faraday rotation measures of the hydra cluster core .",
    "have extended their work to predict velocities and length - scales for the turbulence in a number of cool core clusters .",
    "they argue that a small - scale turbulent dynamo is maintaining magnetic fields and that turbulent dissipation can balance radiative cooling .",
    "contrary indications have been identified ( fabian et al 2003b ) in the highly extended , and often linear , optical filaments in the perseus @xcite and other clusters ( e.g a1795 , ; centaurus , ) .",
    "such filaments have coherent velocity fields and small velocity widths @xcite so must be relatively old ( perhaps 100  myr ) and in thermal pressure equilibrium with the surrounding icm .",
    "the optical surface brightness of such filaments translates to a thickness of the emission regions of less than a pc .",
    "if the icm is turbulent and pushing on a filament , it will respond after interacting with its own column density which means a kpc or so of icm , given the thousandfold higher density in the filament .",
    "this is only a few arcsec in nearby clusters so the apparent linear nature of the filaments would soon be destroyed by a fully turbulent icm .",
    "they may however reflect streamlines and could have been drawn out by the motion of bubbles .",
    "note the similarity of the horseshoe - shaped filament in the perseus cluster to that of streamlines behind rising water bubbles ; see fig . 184 in and discussion by    the inner icm in clusters with significant linear filaments may therefore have subsonic random flows , particularly radial behind bubbles . whether this is turbulence",
    "depends on how turbulence is defined .",
    "it does not resemble fully - developed hydrodynamical turbulence ( see fig . 186 in ) but is not dissimilar from flows in some magnetohydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. ) .",
    "what is unclear is the driving mechanism for turbulence in a cluster core .",
    "a subcluster merger may well have made the coma cluster icm turbulent , but such mergers will not have strongly affected the dense core cluster under discussion here ( but see ) . driving turbulence into the dense core will require considerable energy .",
    "rising radio bubbles are a possible driver but whether their motion leads to a turbulent cascade of energy to much smaller scales must be determined . the viscosity of the icm may play a key role in this issue .",
    "the abundance gradients seen at the centers of many cool core clusters provides a further constraint on turbulence and diffusion .",
    "have modelled the production and maintenance of the gradient in the perseus cluster and find a diffusion coefficient @xmath196  @xmath197  s@xmath198 .",
    "have carried out a similar analysis on the more abundance - peaked centaurus cluster to obtain a value of @xmath199 times smaller .",
    "large scale global flows have been considered that transfer significant thermal energy from one region of the cluster to another . have discussed flows which move in both radial directions . to be long lived , both mass and energy must be supplied to the inflowing gas over a large volume .",
    "the energy is assumed to be derived from bubbles .    considered a multiphase flow in which outer denser blobs fall inward and mix with inner , cooler blobs , thereby tapping the extended gravitational potential . unless there is some outflow or cooling",
    ", however , mass builds up near the cluster center",
    ".      a cooling flow will amplify tangled magnetic fields in the intracluster gas @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields in the general icm have been found through radio observations of faraday rotation @xcite .",
    "such observations also show it rising in cool core clusters where the highest values have been found @xcite .",
    "the results indicate a roughly cellular structure for the magnetic field of a few kpc ( e.g. the centaurus cluster , ) .",
    "such a structure may occur from a spectrum of magnetic fields perhaps due to turbulence @xcite .",
    "near the center the magnetic pressure can be 10 per cent of the thermal pressure , perhaps more .",
    "an important effect of the magnetic field is that it can dramatically reduce the microphysical transport processes in the icm .",
    "cosmic rays are a likely additional component in cluster cores .",
    "relativistic electrons produce the minihalo in the x - ray peaked region of the perseus cluster ( see for a theoretical discussion ) and may produce a hard x - ray component by inverse compton scattering @xcite .",
    "the effects of cosmic rays could be important in mediating the flow of mechanical energy in the core .",
    "notes that a cosmic ray phase can make heated gas thermally stable .",
    "a floor temperature of 0.3 times the local ambient temperature is derived if the cosmic ray pressure is 1/3 of the ambient value .",
    "this situation is different from the similar factor seen in observations , which applies across the whole cool region , not just locally .",
    "note that gas is not observed to `` pile up '' at any particular temperature .",
    "if cosmic rays are spread through the core in many small bubbles , then they would be very effective in dissipating the energy in sound waves ( heinz & churazov 2005 ) . such bubbles must be small not to be detectable in deep images ( eg .",
    "fabian et al 2005b ) .",
    "if agn heating balances cooling on timescales of @xmath200 to a few @xmath201 then some feedback is needed to prevent either a cooling catastrophe ( none has yet been found ) or an event heating all the central gas and blowing it out .",
    "bondi accretion onto a central black hole provides a link between the two regions but the radius range from the bondi radius of say 50  pc to the icm at 50  kpc is a factor of one thousand .",

    "one last possibility is that sedimentation acts @xcite .",
    "helium then accumulates at the cluster center @xcite possibly explaining the puzzling low metallicity found at the center of some nearby clusters observed with chandra .",
    "the main low temperature cooling gas is then helium rich which can produce much weaker emission lines .",
    "stars formed from helium rich gas will have short lifetimes so avoiding some constraints on the cold mass sink @xcite .",
    "tangled magnetic fields will of course significantly reduce the prospect of any sedimentation .",
    "the simplest explanation for the common appearance of cold core , x - ray peaked clusters is that , when averaged over tens of myr , the radiative cooling is balanced in part by distributed heating .",
    "thermal conduction as a means of distributing heat from outer gas is ruled out for low and intermediate temperature clusters .",
    "it may however have a role in spreading the energy in the central parts .",

    "note that most semi - analytic models for galaxy formation ( e.g. kauffmann et al 1999 ) already needed to suppress cooling in massive haloes in order to match observation .",
    "difficulties and doubts remain with regard to the issues of the energy dissipation and distribution processes which are tied in with the transport processes in the gas .",
    "similarly , it is not clear how the feedback manages to produce such similar cooling time profiles in systems where temperatures and thus masses differ by over an order of magnitude ? there still remains the possibility that some process not yet foreseen , or at least not well studied will eventually prove more important than the effect of the central radio source , or will at least be important in mediating its effect .",
    "the central radio source is so common and so energetic however that it must at least be part of the solution .",
    "similarly , the motions of galaxies or interacting dark matter , if it exists , could be important in heating cluster cores along with the agn . given the wide range of objects in which a balance is required , we suspect that a single mechanism is dominant , rather than several .    the need for a heating - cooling balance is in a time - averaged sense , over intervals of about @xmath161 . in most cases",
    "the heating has not been so energetic as to drive gas out of the inner regions nor so weak as to allow much cooling at very high rates .",
    "examples of objects at the extremes are hydra  a and cygnus  a where heating is high ( but is dumped mostly at large radii outside the cool region ) and a2597 and rxc1504.1 - 0248 where cooling appears to be high ( in the latter object over 70 per cent of the total x - ray luminosity emerges from the cool core ; ) .    in most objects",
    "residual cooling at a rate of about 10 per cent of the simple unheated cooling rates appears to occur .",
    "it could be larger if non - radiative cooling , due to mixing say , is occurring .",
    "stars form from the cooled gas giving the excess blue light seen in the bcgs .",
    "mass loss from such stars can make the cooled gas dusty and radio bubbles drag some of it back out to large radii .",
    "the time evolution of the heating / cooling balance is little understood .",
    "we suspect that the common temperature drop associated with the short central cooling times _ is _ due to radiative cooling and that heating only came into balance when the overall temperature structure was in place .",
    "perhaps the central galaxy and its central bh grew until balance was achieved , and growth required cooling .",
    "comparison of samples of clusters at @xmath204 with @xmath205 @xcite shows little surprisingly change in the distribution of cooling times at 50 kpc .",
    "the results imply that any balance was established well beyond @xmath206 .",
    "few massive cool core clusters are known at much higher redshifts than that of rxj1347 at @xmath207 .",
    "this may however be a selection effect .",
    "they will be absent from x - ray cluster samples if the central bh is a bright x - ray source such as a quasar . if a central quasar outshines the host cluster in x - rays then the object will generally be classified as a quasar .",
    "h1821 + 643 is a good example of a bright quasar in an x - ray peaked cluster at intermediate redshift ( @xmath208 , ) .",
    "searches for clusters around powerful radio - loud quasars and galaxies have found some examples at @xmath209 @xcite but no complete searches have been done .",
    "further detailed deep studies with chandra and xmm - newton as well as future studies with constellation - x and xeus are needed in order to better understand the heating / cooling balance .",
    "there is considerable potential for studies of the cool and warm gas and dust around the bcg using hst , spitzer and ground - based telescopes .",
    "larger cluster samples are needed , particularly at medium to high redshifts .",
    "determining the extent of a heating - cooling balance ( or not ) in groups , elliptical galaxies , and galaxy bulges is also important as is the evolution of any balance in all massive objects .",
