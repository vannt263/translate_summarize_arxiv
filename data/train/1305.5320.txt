    "<S> @xmath0 decays are helpful in determining the cp violation angle @xmath1 , and we analyze these decay processes within the perturbative qcd approach based on @xmath2 factorization . we found that the branching ratio of @xmath3 can reach the order of @xmath4 , due to the enhancement of nonfactorizable contributions in color - suppressed @xmath5-emission , while the branching ratio of @xmath6 is of the order @xmath7 . </S>",
