    "the ability to fabricate freestanding graphene , a single atomic layer of graphite , has raised interesting questions with regard to its surface electronic structure . due to the fact that this system exhibits a mirror plane with two surfaces ,",

    "can clearly be assigned from the amplitude of their wave functions at @xmath54 where the odd states have a node , whereas the even states have an antinode .",
    "the presence of the metal substrate breaks the mirror symmetry of the freestanding graphene and the parity of the image - potential is , in principle , no longer a good quantum number . at a graphene - metal separation as large as @xmath55   , however , the influence of the substrate on the lowest members ( @xmath56 ) of the image - potential states is still weak due to the rather small spatial extent of their wave functions perpendicular to the surface .",
    "therefore , their probability densities almost resemble those of freestanding graphene .",
    "we point out , that even for large @xmath10 , only image - potential states that originate from graphene and no states that are bound in the potential well formed by the image - potential of the metal and its surface barrier are found .",
    "this is related to the large difference in work function between graphene and ru(0001 ) ( @xmath57  ev @xcite ) , which results in an additional repulsion from the ru surface .",
    "this contributes to a reduction of the binding energies with respect to those of freestanding graphene .",
    "the latter are depicted by dashed lines in .",
    "the same argument applies for the ir(111 ) ( @xmath58  ev @xcite ) and the ni(111 ) ( @xmath59  ev @xcite ) surface . beside the work function difference",
    ", the repulsion due to the surface barrier of the metal contributes additionally to a reduction of the binding energies with respect to freestanding graphene . at @xmath55  ",
    ", this applies particularly to the higher members ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ,  ) because of their more extended wave functions , which are already considerably perturbed by the repulsion due to the surface barrier .",
    "this also results in an asymmetry and phase shift of the wave functions with respect to those of freestanding graphene .",
    "the wave function of the state labeled as @xmath62 at @xmath55   , for example , has now almost an antinode at @xmath54 and more closely resembles the wave function of the ( @xmath63)-state of freestanding graphene as denoted by the corresponding symbol in .    at intermediate separations ,",
    "the properties of the image - potential states start to be governed by the image - potentials of both surfaces , and the attractive image - potential of the metal partly compensates for the repulsion due to the surface barrier and the work function difference .",
    "the attraction of the metal leads to a maximum of the binding energy of each state at specific separations as can be seen in .",
    "this is also reflected by the form of the wave functions shown in . at @xmath64   , for example",
    ", the symmetric ( @xmath65)-state is still almost unaffected while the more extended wave function of the ( @xmath66)-state is slightly attracted towards the metal surface which results in an increase of the probability density in between the metal surface and the graphene layer compared to larger separations .",
    "for comparison we have also made simplified calculations ( not shown ) where we described the metal as a simple barrier without an image - potential similar to the model used in @xcite . in this case",
    ", we do not observe this attraction and all image - potential states are always repelled when the graphene layer approaches the metal surface .    at small graphene - metal separations",
    "( @xmath67   ) , the repulsion due to the surface barrier of the metal dominates and also the phase of the ( @xmath66 ) wave function shifts and the latter starts to resemble that of the higher - lying ( @xmath68)-state of freestanding graphene .",
    "in particular at a separation of @xmath5   , which corresponds to the _ h _ areas of g / ru(0001 ) , the vacuum part ( @xmath69 ) of all wave functions almost resembles the corresponding part of the symmetric series of freestanding graphene .",
    "this can be regarded as a transition from the double series of image - potential states of freestanding graphene to one single series , omitting the differentiation with regard to the parity .",
    "since only the former ( @xmath65)-state maintains a certain similarity to the corresponding state on freestanding graphene , we denote this fact by writing @xmath52 in parentheses in the _ h _ areas . at a separation of @xmath4   , which corresponds to the _",
    "l _ areas of g / ru(0001 ) , all wave functions are further repelled from the metal surface . even if the phase of the wave functions now correspond to the phase of the odd series of states on free standing graphene , the mirror symmetry has completely vanished , which is indicated by omitting the parity for the whole series .",
    "now , all wave functions almost resemble the form of those on the clean ru surface with one layer of atoms atop , as can be seen by comparing ( e ) and ( f ) . in comparison to the clean ru surface , however , the spatial extent of the wave functions in the vacuum is larger , which indicates a stronger decoupling from the surface . in",
    "the _ h _ areas , on the other hand , a considerable amount of the ( @xmath70 ) wave function still fits in between the graphene and the ru surface and is therefore more strongly coupled to ru as compared to the _",
    "l _ areas .",
    "this state is closely related to the interlayer state of graphite @xcite .    as depicted by the different symbols in , the change of the wave function s character upon approaching the graphene layer to the metal surface is also reflected by the change of the binding energy with respect to the vacuum level .",
    "whenever the binding energy of the image - potential states of the entire system becomes smaller compared to the next energetic adjacent state of freestanding graphene , the local symmetry at @xmath54 is closer to the latter . at @xmath55   , for example ,",
    "the binding energies of the first , second , and third state of the entire system are larger compared to the second , third , and fourth state of freestanding graphene .",
    "consequently , their local symmetry at @xmath54 is still close to that of the first ( @xmath65 ) , second ( @xmath66 ) , and third ( @xmath68 ) state of freestanding graphene .",
    "the energy of the fourth state of the entire system , however , is already smaller compared to the fifth state ( @xmath63 ) of freestanding graphene .",
    "its local symmetry at @xmath54 more closely resembles the symmetry of that state and not of the fourth state ( @xmath62 ) of freestanding graphene .",
    "the energy of this state is therefore drawn as a closed symbol which denotes states of even ( local ) symmetry .",
    "for decreasing graphene - metal separation , the binding energies of the image - potential states increase slightly at first due to the attractive image - potential of the metal . at separations found in real graphene / metal systems",
    "( @xmath71   ) , however , the repulsion due to the surface barrier of the metal dominates and results in a rapid decrease of the binding energies upon further approach .",
    "the sequence of the relative energy spacings is , however , rather insensitive towards @xmath10 and resembles a scaled rydberg series with decreasing energy separation for increasing quantum number for all @xmath10 .",
    "the absolute change of the binding energy as a function of @xmath47 is most pronounced for the first image - potential state .",
    "it decreases from more than 1.4  ev at large @xmath10 to 0.95  ev at the separation found in the _ h _ areas of g / ru(0001 ) and finally to 0.47  ev at the separation found in the _",
    "the difference between the binding energies with respect to @xmath72 in the _ h _ and _ l _ areas of 0.48  ev is twice as large as the difference between the local work functions of 0.24  ev @xcite .",
    "the first image - potential state in the _ h _ areas has therefore a smaller energy with respect to the fermi level @xmath73 when compared to the the corresponding state in the _",
    "l _ areas .",
    "this confirms the assignment of the peaks in the 2ppe spectrum of @xcite which is reproduced in the inset of .",
    "this assignment is also in agreement with density functional theory ( dft ) calculations by borca _",
    "@xcite which shows that the results of our model calculations are robust also for small distances where dft can explicitly describe the chemical interaction between graphene and the metal . for large distances and higher quantum numbers",
    "the evolution of the binding energies with distance depicted in @xcite considerably differs from our results which we attribute to the fact that dft can not properly consider the long - range image - force .",
    "for the second image - potential state , the calculated difference between binding energies with respect to @xmath15 in the _ h _ and _ l _ areas is in the order of the difference in the local work function , which explains that these two states could not be resolved separately in the 2ppe spectra .",
    "the red horizontal lines in depict the experimental results from @xcite under consideration of the local work functions in the _ h _ and _ l _ areas , and help visualize the very good agreement between experiment and model calculation .",
    "the small deviation for the binding energy of the lowest image - potential state energy in the _ h _ areas is reduced if one considers the additional reduction of the calculated binding energy due to the lateral localization as discussed above .",
    "the localization of this state should be stronger in the _ h _ areas as deduced from the effective mass which has been found to be twice as large as the free electron mass @xcite .",
    "the results of our model calculation make it also possible to qualitatively interpret the experimentally observed decay dynamics of electrons in these states , as has been investigated by time - resolved 2ppe @xcite . as shown in ( e ) , the probability densities of all image - potential states in the _",
    "areas mostly resemble those of the clean ru(0001 ) surface but with some degree of decoupling , i.e.  the center of gravity of the probability density is located further away from the metal into the vacuum . at first glance , this similarity to the clean ru surface seems to be surprising .",
    "the graphene - metal separation in the _",
    "l _ areas is , however , almost identical to the ru - layer spacing ( @xmath74   @xcite ) .",
    "the ru surface covered by one metallic - like graphene overlayer therefore has similar properties with respect to the image - potential states as the extension of the ru crystal by one more layer of ru atoms . at the clean ru(0001 ) surface ,",
    "the lifetimes of electrons in the first two image - potential states of @xmath75  fs and @xmath76  fs @xcite are comparably short because the decay by inelastic scattering with bulk electrons is very efficient due to the high density of states of the ru 4d bands just below the fermi level @xcite .",
    "thus , the slightly enhanced experimental lifetimes of @xmath77  fs and @xmath78  fs @xcite are a direct indication for a certain degree of decoupling in the _",
    "l _ areas . in the _ h _ areas , a considerable part of the probability density of the ( @xmath70)-state fits below the graphene layer close to the ru surface .",
    "this enhances the electronic coupling to the ru bulk states as is reflected by the shorter lifetime of @xmath79  fs @xcite , which is identical to the value found on clean ru(0001 ) .    by adapting @xmath8 , our model",
    "can be easily applied to the description of graphene layers on other metal substrates . with ir(111 ) and ni(111 ) we chose two examples that represent limiting cases of weak and strong interaction with the graphene layer , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that g / ir(111 ) grows with a rather large and homogeneous separation of @xmath80   @xcite which is very similar to the separation found in the _ h _ areas of g / ru(0001 ) .",
    "graphene and ni(111 ) have almost no lattice mismatch .",
    "this results in the growth of a flat graphene layer on ni(111 ) , despite the strong interaction @xcite . the resulting separation of about @xmath81   is very similar to that found in the _",
    "l _ areas of g / ru(0001 ) .",
    "binding energies and lifetimes of the image - potential states on g / ir(111 ) have been measured by 2ppe @xcite and can be directly compared with the results of our model calculations .",
    "no experimental data on g / ni(111 ) are available , but 2ppe results on the binding energies for the clean ni(111 ) surface @xcite make it possible to properly adjust the parameter of the metal potential and to predict the binding energies for the graphene covered surface .",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling of ni results in a spin - split surface - projected band structure which is reflected by an exchange - splitting of the image - potential states .",
    "the observed splitting of @xmath82  mev is , however , small compared to the linewidth and can only be observed with spin - resolved detection @xcite .",
    "we therefore neglect the exchange - splitting here and use a spin - integrated surface - projected band gap extracted from @xcite for our model calculations .",
    "because the size and position of the surface - projected bulk band gap do not differ much between ru(0001 ) , ir(111 ) , and ni(111 ) , the calculated binding energies depend most sensitively on the graphene - metal separation @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the binding energies for g / ir(111 ) , as well as for g / ni(111 ) , are very similar to the results for g / ru(0001 ) at the corresponding separations .",
    "as shown in , the results of our model calculation for the binding energies on g / ir(111 ) are in excellent agreement with the experimental data . for g / ni(111 )",
    "we predict much smaller binding energies compared to g / ir(111 ) .",
    "this is due to the stronger repulsion of the image - potential states at the smaller separations .",
    "the binding energies on g / ni(111 ) are on the other hand comparable to those on the _ l _ areas of g / ru(111 ) in correspondence to the similar separation @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the formation of image - potential states at the interface of graphene / sic , even if our model is not directly applicable to this semiconducting substrate .",
    "although graphene might possess only a weak interaction to sic , our results generally show that the shape of the image - potential states is very sensitive to the substrate induced symmetry break even for large separations due to their large spatial extent . in another 2ppe experiment on graphene / sic(0001 ) ,",
    "shearer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite indeed observed a single series of sharp symmetric peaks of image - potential states in agreement with data shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems rather unlikely that the experimentally found splitting of the first image - potential state on graphene / sic @xcite can be interpreted as a remnant of the mirror symmetry of freestanding graphene with a small energy separation between these two states .",
    "the latter is particularly hard to understand because the approach of a flat graphene layer towards a substrate with a surface barrier does not change the relative energy spacing of adjacent states , i.e.  the energy spacing between the lowest two states is always larger than the subsequent spacing because the energy sequence of the rydberg series is at all distances dominated by the long - range image - potential .",
    "on the basis of an analytical , one - dimensional potential , we can quantitatively describe the formation of image - potential states at the interface between a graphene layer and a metal surface by means of model calculations . by systematic variation of the graphene - metal separation ,",
    "we have shown how the double rydberg - like series of even and odd image - potential states of freestanding graphene evolves towards a single series of the compound system when a flat graphene layer is located at a distance to the metal as found in real graphene / metal systems .",
    "this transition is driven by the repulsion from the metal substrate , which increasingly reduces the mirror symmetry of freestanding graphene with decreasing separation . even for separations found in weakly interacting systems ,",
    "we find no remnant of the distinction between states of even and odd symmetry . at these intermediate separations , the first image - potential state is partly trapped between the metal and the graphene layer .",
    "it attains properties of an interfacial state . at distances found in strongly interacting systems ,",
    "on the other hand , the wave functions almost resemble those of image - potential states on a clean metal surface but with a higher degree of decoupling .",
    "the repulsion of the image - potential states from the metal surface is also responsible for a strong reduction of their binding energies with decreasing graphene - metal separation .",
    "this explains the distinct differences of the experimentally observed binding energies of the first ( @xmath1 ) image - potential states in the _ h _ and _ l _ areas of strongly corrugated g / ru(0001 ) .",
    "according to the respective similar separations on weakly interacting g / ir(111 ) and strongly interacting g / ni(111 ) , we find respective comparable binding energies which are in excellent agreement with available experimental data for g / ir(111 ) .",
