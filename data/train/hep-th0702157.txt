    "there are two well known problems in studying the anharmonic and the double - well oscillators .",
    "the first is that a naive perturbation theory of anharmonic oscillator leads to a divergent perturbation series even for an infinitesimal value of the coupling strength due to the eventual dominance of the perturbative correction over the un - perturbed contribution for large amplitude of oscillation  @xcite . to remedy this difficulty several generalized perturbation methods",
    "have been developed  @xcite .",
    "there have been many recent developments which provide well defined perturbative iterative solutions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions  @xcite .",
    "an interesting differential equation method , in parallel with mathieu equation , was presented by liang and mller - kirsten  @xcite .",
    "a through analysis for this asymptotic perturbation and large order behaviors was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another difficulty is that a double - well oscillator has completely different algebraic structure and ground state wavefunction from those of anharmonic oscillator .",
    "therefore , most perturbative approaches treat the two oscillators separately  @xcite . the transition from a single - well system to a double - well system of a time - dependent oscillator",
    "was calculated through a nonperturbative method such as the wkb approximation  @xcite or by accommodating contributions from many excited states in addition to the ground states of symmetric oscillator  @xcite .",
    "even though these methods provide good approximations to the ground state and excited state energies , its generalization to field theory of infinite degrees of freedom or to time - dependent systems with symmetry - breaking - like phenomena encounters difficulties .",
    "therefore , it is important to establish a consistent approximation method that can treat both of the oscillators in the same way .",
    "this subject has not been extensively studied compared to the problem of divergent perturbation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present a possible resolution to the second problem using a variational perturbation method .",
    "we present a unified treatment of the anharmonic and the double - well oscillators in the point of view of a generalized deformed oscillator .",
    "this provides an algebraic method in which the two oscillators are dealt with on an equal footing .",
    "we also present a natural expansion parameter defined by the ratios of three length scales appearing in the trial wavefunction .",
    "its numerical value is smaller than @xmath2 for all physical parameter range of the system for the double - gaussian trial wavefunctions used in this paper . to do these",
    ", we solve the liouville - von neumann ( lvn ) equation perturbatively .",
    "the hamiltonian describing both the anharmonic oscillator and the double - well oscillator is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 being a positive ( anharmonic ) or a negative ( double - well ) real number . for @xmath22 with @xmath23 ,",
    "the system becomes a harmonic oscillator ( harmonic oscillator limit ) and for @xmath24 with @xmath25 the system describes a set of two separated wells of harmonic oscillators ( infinitely separated double - well limit ) .",
    "the lvn equation  @xcite , @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is equivalent to the schrdinger equation and physical information can be obtained from the invariant operator @xmath27 .",
    "based on this operator , a complete hilbert space of the oscillator can be constructed .",
    "the equation  ( [ lvn ] ) was used as a starting point in developing many approximation methods and of physical applications  @xcite .",
    "this method provides a powerful basis in constructing the variational perturbation methods since the zeroth order solution of  ( [ lvn ] ) can be made to be a variational approximation of the system . in the present paper , we will utilize this aspect to develop a new variational perturbative approximation with two variational parameters for time - independent oscillators .",
    "generalization to time - dependent systems is straightforward since the lvn equation is known to be one of the best ways to treat the time - dependent system  @xcite .",
    "standard perturbation theory based on harmonic oscillators assumes that the coupling term @xmath28 is smaller than the other term : @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to a ` localization condition ' of the expectation value , @xmath30 , with respect to the ground state wavefunction .",
    "this inequality restricts the applicability of the standard perturbative method to small coupling . to overcome this limitation , the gaussian approximation method  @xcite and its generalizations",
    "have been developed  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian approximation starts from defining a new frequency scale @xmath31 , which is variationally determined to satisfy @xmath32 the localization condition now takes the form @xmath33 , which is satisfied for @xmath34 .",
    "the characteristic length scale and momentum scale corresponding to this frequency are @xmath35 the gaussian wave - function is annihilated by the annihilation operator , @xmath36 which satisfies a simple commutation relation @xmath37=1 $ ] .",
    "based on this commutation relation , a complete hilbert space can be constructed by consecutive operations of the creation operator @xmath38 to the ground state @xmath39 defined by @xmath40",
    ".    there have also been some attempts to apply the gaussian approximation to the double - well systems , in which one wants to find an annihilation operator of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath31 are the parameters to be determined by variation  @xcite . in spite of the success of this approach in finding an approximate ground state energy of double - well oscillator ,",
    "it is to be noted that the approach does not reflect the symmetry of the system in the sense that the state annihilated by @xmath43 does not have the symmetry of the potential , the space inversion symmetry .",
    "an approximation method which keeps this symmetry is the double gaussian approximation ( dga )  @xcite , in which the sum of two gaussian wave - packets ( or similar ones ) are used to approximate the ground state wave - function of a double - well oscillator .",
    "a major deficiency of the dga is that no hilbert space based on the approximate ground state has been found , which is one of the issues to be dealt with in the present paper .",
    "we develop a method in which a double - well oscillator is dealt with in the same way as a single - well anharmonic oscillator . before introducing the method",
    ", we point out some interesting features of double - well and anharmonic oscillator systems .",
    "the first is that the eigenvalues of a double - well oscillators are not approximately equi - distanced contrary to the case of an anharmonic oscillator .",
    "for example , the difference between the first excited state energy and the ground state energy is considerably different from the difference between the second excited state energy and the first excited state energy .",
    "this implies that a single set of creation and annihilation operators @xmath44 can not connect all the eigenstates with reasonable accuracy . considering the parity even states and odd states separately , however , one finds that the energy eigenvalues are almost even - spaced in each parity sector [ for example , see chapter 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite for exact solution of double - well oscillator with the potential @xmath45 .",
    "this suggests us to consider operators connecting eigenstates by two steps , connecting the states among the same parity eigenstates .",
    "we call the ground state @xmath8 and the @xmath46 excited state @xmath47 as the ` ground ' states for each parity sector .",
    "thus , the @xmath46 excited state @xmath48 is the ground state of odd parity sector and the state @xmath49 is the ground state of even parity sector .",
    "another interesting feature of double - well oscillator is that there exists a set of operators ( @xmath50 ) and even and odd ground states @xmath51 , which consistently describe both the harmonic oscillator limit and the infinitely separated double - well limit .",
    "consider the following states of even and odd parities , @xmath52 where the states @xmath53 stand for the ground states of a harmonic oscillator centered around @xmath54 , annihilated by @xmath55 , satisfying @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the time - independent wavefunctions for states @xmath53 are given by the gaussian wave - packet , @xmath58 the overlap of the two states @xmath59 used in defining the normalization constant is @xmath60 evidently , these even and odd ground states are orthogonal to each other : @xmath61 we now show that the states @xmath62 and an operator ( @xmath63 ) , where @xmath64 , correctly describe the two limiting hilbert spaces , the harmonic oscillator limit ( @xmath65 for @xmath66 ) and the infinitely separated double - well limit ( @xmath67 for @xmath68 ) of the system described by the hamiltonian  ( [ h : ah ] ) .",
    "consider the harmonic oscillator limit first .",
    "the ground state wavefunction of a harmonic oscillator is a gaussian .",
    "since the sum of two gaussian wave packets of the same frequency is a gaussian , the ground state wavefunction is correctly reproduced in the @xmath66 limit .",
    "let us examine the @xmath46 excited state in the @xmath69 limit .",
    "the odd parity ground state becomes an exact first excited state wavefunction of a harmonic oscillator in the @xmath70 limit : @xmath71 therefore @xmath72 gives the exact ground state and the first excited state in the harmonic oscillator limit .",
    "repeated actions of the operator @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , on the two states @xmath75 reproduce the complete hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "both of the states @xmath75 are annihilated by @xmath76 . in this sense ,",
    "the set of operators ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) and the even and odd ground states @xmath79 correctly reproduce the harmonic oscillator system in the @xmath69 limit and @xmath80 and @xmath78 play the role of an annihilation operator and a creation operator which raises and lowers the states by two steps .",
    "we next consider the infinitely separated double - well limit by setting @xmath81 . now",
    ", the two states @xmath53 are completely separated from each other and do not overlap .",
    "therefore , the energy of the two states @xmath75 are degenerated and the operator @xmath78 acts separately on each states @xmath82 and raises each states @xmath53 to the @xmath46 excited states .",
    "for example , for @xmath83 state , @xmath84 where in the infinitely separated double - well limit , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "similar calculations will be applicable to the state @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , @xmath77 annihilates both of the states @xmath82 , simultaneously . in this sense , the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 play the role of an annihilation operator and a creation operator and correctly produce the hilbert space of the infinitely separated double - well oscillator in the @xmath68 limit .",
    "this inspection of the two limits @xmath88 implies that , by using the even power operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 , one may describe both the anharmonic and the double - well oscillators simultaneously .",
    "we construct a @xmath0 order invariant annihilation operator @xmath89 of the exact annihilation operator @xmath27 of the system  ( [ h : ah ] ) in sec .",
    "ii by solving the lvn equation to the lowest order for variational approximation .",
    "we construct the creation ( @xmath90 ) and annihilation ( @xmath89 ) operators as even - power series in @xmath91 and @xmath92 in such a way that they raise or lower the energy eigenstates by two steps .",
    "for example , the creation operator raises the ground state to the @xmath93 excited state and the @xmath46 excited state to the @xmath94 excited state , etc .",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath89 must annihilate both of the ground state @xmath95 and the first excited state @xmath96 , and their wavefunctions are an even function and an odd function of @xmath97 , respectively . in the harmonic oscillator limit , @xmath66 ,",
    "the annihilation operator must become the square of the annihilation operator of the harmonic oscillator . in the infinitely separated double - well limit , @xmath68 ,",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath89 must reproduce the annihilation operator of a harmonic oscillator which is centered at each bottom of the double - well potential .",
    "an algebra satisfied by the operators are obtained and then used to construct the hilbert spaces for the oscillators .",
    "this operator @xmath89 is used in sec .",
    "iii to construct the variational approximations of the anharmonic and the double - well oscillators .",
    "it is shown to provide a good approximation for the energies of the oscillator eigenstates with errors smaller than @xmath98% for most range of parameters of both the double - well oscillator and the anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we then calculate the first order correction to the invariant operators @xmath99 , and a systematic method to construct higher order invariant operators in perturbative series is developed in sec .",
    "we conclude with some discussions on our method in the last section .",
    "the variational perturbation method starts from variationally identifying the @xmath0 order approximate ground state and an annihilation operator which annihilates the ground state .",
    "for example , the gaussian approximation uses the gaussian wave - packet , @xmath100 , as the zeroth order ground state , with @xmath101 a variational parameter . in this section , we try to find a @xmath0 order ground state and an annihilation operator , which describe both the double - well oscillator and the anharmonic oscillator , consistently",
    ".      there have been attempts to find the solution @xmath102 of the lvn equation  ( [ lvn ] ) for anharmonic oscillator as a taylor - like series of @xmath91 and @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "this process reveals that the anharmonic oscillator  ( [ h : ah ] ) with @xmath34 has the structure of a @xmath17deformed oscillator to the first order in the variational perturbation series and that of a generalized deformed oscillator to the next order  @xcite .",
    "this observation is based on the fact that the low lying eigenstates of anharmonic oscillator are localized around @xmath103 and @xmath104 , in the sense that , @xmath105 in the gaussian approximation , this condition is implicitly assumed .",
    "but for the double - well systems the conditions  ( [ con : g0 ] ) are not satisfied .",
    "the probability distributions of low - lying eigenstates of a double - well oscillator would be bi - centered around @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "we thus develop a generalized series expansion in terms of bi - centered polynomials .",
    "for example , a non - singular function @xmath108 can be written as @xmath109 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] identifying @xmath110 for @xmath111 provides an approximation of @xmath108 around @xmath112 in a series form .",
    "if one wants to describe physics around @xmath54 , this approximation can be used effectively .",
    "we consider an explicit example of a bi - centered packet given by the sum of two gaussian packets centered at @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "then we have the inequality @xmath126 and @xmath127 always , where the equalities hold for @xmath128 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "thus the ratios @xmath129 and @xmath130 are always not larger than @xmath131 and they take the values @xmath132 for @xmath70 and @xmath133 for @xmath81 .",
    "since the multiplication of these parameters , @xmath134 is always smaller than @xmath131 , it can be used as a good perturbation parameter for systems with bi - centered wave packets as approximate eigenstates . note that these parameters are not fixed , but",
    "depend on the nature of wavefunctions .",
    "thus we will use these parameters as variational parameters .    , @xmath130 , and @xmath135 as functions of the distance between the central positions of the two gaussian packets .",
    "this is the explicit zeroth order result for even - parity eigenstates .",
    "the horizontal distance in the figure is rescaled by the tangent function , @xmath136 .",
    "note that the explicit numerical value of @xmath135 is smaller than @xmath2 . ]    for calculational convenience we introduce dimensionless operators @xmath137 and @xmath138 for momentum and position operators defined by @xmath139 note also that @xmath140 relates the two parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 by @xmath141 the commutation relation between @xmath138 and @xmath137 is @xmath142 & = & i , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the localization condition  ( [ exp:0 ] ) becomes @xmath143 the expectation value of @xmath144 is explicitly given by @xmath145    for later use , we introduce some operators of @xmath146 and @xmath147 , @xmath148 which will be useful in describing the bi - centered systems .      we now consider a quartic oscillator , which will be used as a basis for the variational approximation , described by the hamiltonian : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the potential value at @xmath151 and the subscript in @xmath152 denotes that this hamiltonian will be used as a @xmath0 order form for the variational perturbative expansion of double - well and anharmonic oscillators .",
    "the constant @xmath153 is the value of @xmath129 in the harmonic oscillator limit , @xmath154 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath155 for @xmath156 and @xmath157 for @xmath158 . note that this is one of the most general form of quartic hamiltonian if @xmath101 and @xmath159 are chosen arbitrarily .",
    "note also that only one of the three quantities @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath159 is an independent variable because of eqs .",
    "( [ e : o x ] ) , ( [ ep : vep1 ] ) , and ( [ y2:exp ] )",
    ". since we are to use the ground states of  ( [ h : sim ] ) as trial wavefunctions for the variational approximation for the hamiltonian  ( [ h : ah ] ) , we have two variational parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath159 .",

    ", the ground state is given by a gaussian packet .",
    "the exact frequency is given by @xmath163 and there is no quartic potential in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian  ( [ h : sim ] ) becomes that of the harmonic oscillator with correct frequency @xmath164 if @xmath165 on the other hand , for the ground state of the infinitely separated double - well limit ( @xmath162 ) , we have @xmath166 and @xmath124 and the @xmath167 term disappears since @xmath129 vanishes .",
    "each packet at @xmath54 evolves as if it is a free harmonic oscillator .",
    "the frequency of each packets is determined by the second derivative of the potential with respect to @xmath97 at the bottom of the potential .",
    "this determines @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the coefficient @xmath169 of @xmath170 term must be @xmath131 in this limit : @xmath171 with these observations , it is clear that the constants @xmath160 and @xmath172 are of @xmath173 .",
    "the values @xmath160 and @xmath169 become important at the harmonic oscillator limit and the infinitely separated double - well limit , respectively . for both limits , therefore , we may set @xmath174 for the zeroth order approximate hamiltonian @xmath152 . with the values of @xmath160 and @xmath169 of eq .",
    "( [ coef ] ) , the hamiltonian  ( [ h : sim ] ) still describes the most general anharmonic and double - well oscillators since @xmath101 and @xmath159 are free parameters .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous section , we try to find an annihilation operator @xmath27 and a creation operator @xmath175 to @xmath173 in this subsection .",
    "since we want to find the operators as even functions of the bi - centered operators we try the simplest ansatz for the zeroth order operator @xmath89 : @xmath176 to the zeroth order , one can easily find that the lvn equation , @xmath177=0 $ ] , becomes a matrix differential equation of the form @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a @xmath180 matrix determined by the commutator of @xmath89 and @xmath181 of eq .",

    ", the differential equation can be solved by a simple matrix eigenvalue equation by setting @xmath182 .",
    "explicit calculation of the commutator @xmath183 $ ] gives the matrix @xmath179 : @xmath184 the eigenvalues of @xmath179 are given by the solution @xmath185 of @xmath186 where @xmath187 we have three different @xmath185 eigenvalues , @xmath188 .",
