    "@xmath5 dark matter makes up to 23% of all the known matter of the universe .",
    "this evidence comes from cosmological observations and numerical simulations  @xcite , which suggest that most of the data can only be explained by the presence of a gravitational field caused by a new type of non - relativistic and non - baryonic fundamental particle @xcite .",
    "if such particles exist , then they should be observed in direct detection experiments , and their effects should affect the internal structure of large self - gravitating bodies such as the earth and our own sun .",
    "thus , it is no surprise that so much of the theoretical work and experimental efforts in the fields of astrophysics , cosmology and particle physics have been dedicated to the discovery of such fundamental particles , hitherto with little success .    among the large number of dark matter particle candidates that have been proposed , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) were until recently among the most popular .",
    "wimps arise in several extensions of the standard model of fundamental particles , such as the supersymmetric models of fundamental particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in such classes of models , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) ,",
    "the neutralino , or possibly the nlsp , is the most suitable candidate for dark matter .",
    "the neutralino is the natural wimp candidate , a stable particle with a self - annihilation cross - section of the order of the weak - scale interaction .",
    "unfortunately , this particle does not resolve the problem of baryon - anti - baryon asymmetry .",
    "recently , several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested a new fundamental particle that carries a conserved charge analogous to the baryon number and would resolve the afore - mentioned problem @xcite .",
    "this new type of matter , known as asymmetric dark matter and consisting mostly of dirac particles , is particularly interesting since these candidates , like wimps , have interactions at the weak - scale and therefore sizeable scattering cross - sections with baryons , even if they do not annihilate @xcite .",
    "asymmetric dark matter models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that such particles should have a mass of the order of a few gev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in recent years",
    ", several underground experiments have been built to search for direct interactions of a dark matter particle with a baryon - nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . amongst current results , positive indication for dark matter",
    "was produced by the dama / libra@xcite and cogent@xcite experimental teams .",
    "both of them have reported evidence of an annual modulation in the differential event rate , which they explain as a consequence of the motion of the earth around the sun @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the data is to assign the observed annual modulation to be caused by the collision of a dark matter particle with a nucleus inside the detector .",
    "the dark matter particle is estimated to have a mass of the order of a few gev ( likely between @xmath6 and @xmath7 gev ) , and a spin - independent scattering cross - section off baryons on the order of @xmath8 .",
    "both experiments show identical positive detections , yet the dama experiment is favorable to a larger scattering cross - section than the cogent experiment .",
    "unfortunately , other direct dark matter search experiments , xenon10/100 @xcite and cdms @xcite found null detections , therefore these experimental results are in disagreement with the previous ones .",
    "most recently , cresst has also reported unexplained events in a similar mass range @xcite .",
    "there is an equally serious objection from both cosmic microwave background and dwarf galaxy studies .",
    "wmap7 uses acoustic peak damping to constrain any annihilation contribution to early ionization @xcite , fermi stacking of dwarf galaxies shows similar limits on the annihilation cross - section as a function of the mass @xcite . in the case of thermal relic cross - sections , dark matter particles with masses below 10 - 30 gev are excluded .",
    "nevertheless , several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have proposed various theoretical solutions to overcome the apparent inconsistencies in the data interpretation .",
    "such theoretical proposals reconcile all the experimental results : dama / libra and cogent experiments are no longer excluded by the cdms and xenon experiments ; and the dama / libra and cogent experimental positive detections , previously , leading to distinct and unrelated scattering cross - sections , now have the same values .",
    "likewise , the annihilation constraint is weakened if some fraction of the wimps do not annihilate , or if the relic cross - section decouples from the current epoch cross - section by allowing for s - wave suppression of the relic cross - section @xcite .",
    "one of the more appealing suggestions is the possibility of the dark matter particle being coupled unequally to the nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) of the colliding nuclei because of isospin violation .",
    "usually , the dark matter particle is considered to couple equally with protons and neutrons .",
    "accordingly , the independent scattering cross - section of heavy elements scales with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atomic number of the nucleus . if the dark matter particles couple differently to protons and neutrons , these lead to a quite distinct interpretation of direct dark matter searches .",
    "this nuclear mechanism is known as isospin coupling violation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was shown that a change of the strength of coupling of the dark matter particle with protons and neutron allows the reconciliation of all of the current experiments @xcite . in such cases , the proton scattering cross - section for the independent interaction increases by @xmath11@xmath12 relative to the usual results , leading to an effective independent scattering cross - section with values between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we point out here that these types of dark matter particles can modify the structure of a star like the sun , leading to a quite different flux of solar neutrinos .    the measurement of the solar neutrino fluxes offers a distinct method for a diagnostic of the central regions of the sun . in past decades ,",
    "the main goal of solar neutrino detection was to study the particle properties of the neutrinos themselves .",
    "now that neutrino oscillations are well - established , detectors are arriving at a stage where information on the solar core can be extracted from precise measurements of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "this enables a search for dark matter in the core of the sun .    in the next section , we review the main physical processes related with the capture of dark matter by a star like the sun . in section 3 , we present a detailed discussion about the production of neutrinos in the solar core and explain the impact of dark matter on the production of neutrino fluxes . in the final section",
    "we discuss the results obtained relative to the current experimental bounds .",

    "the sun by means of its large gravitational field captures an important amount of dark matter particles during its evolution @xcite .",
    "the accumulation of dark matter inside the star leads to the formation of a dark matter core .",
    "the effect on the structure of the star is primarily to provide an additional mechanism for the transfer of energy , which in some cases significantly reduces the temperature gradient , thereby causing the stellar core to become almost isothermal @xcite . in some dark matter scenarios ,",
    "dark matter annihilation provides the star with an extra source of energy which changes the evolution path of the star @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , such physical processes are not relevant for the dark matter models discussed here .",
    "the efficiency of the energy transport provided by dark matter particles depends on the average distance traveled by particles between consecutive collisions , i.e. , the mean free path of the dark matter particle . if the mean free path is short compared with the dark matter scale height , then the energy transfer proceeds by conduction .",
    "alternatively , if the mean free path is large , the successive collisions are widely separated , so that the energy transfer proceeds within the knudsen regime @xcite . in most of the dark matter scenarios discussed in this paper ,",
    "the energy transport is dominated by conduction , although , the code has an implementation of the transport of energy by dark matter in both regimes @xcite .",
    "the amount of dark matter captured by the star , among other parameters , depends on the mass of the dark matter particles @xmath25 and the collision cross - section of dark matter particles with baryons @xcite .",
    "two leading parameters define the scattering of the dark matter particles with the baryon nuclei : the spin - dependent scattering cross - section @xmath26 that is only relevant for hydrogen nuclei ; and the spin - independent scattering cross - section @xmath27 that defines the interaction of the dark matter particles with the heavy nuclei .",
    "the values of @xmath27 used in the calculation include the values found by the new interpretation of experimental results , comprised by the dama / libra and cogent data .",
    "if the value of @xmath27 is larger or equal to @xmath26 , the capture of dark matter particles is dominated by the collisions with heavy nuclei , rather than by collisions with hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the capture rate is computed numerically from the integral expression of @xcite implemented as indicated in @xcite . if not stated otherwise , we assume that the density of dark matter in the halo is @xmath28 , the stellar velocity of the sun is @xmath29 and the maxwellian velocity dispersion is @xmath30 .",
    "the stellar code explicitly follows the capture rate of the dark matter particles by the different chemical elements present inside the sun , some of them changing in isotopic abundance during the sun s evolution .",
    "the paper  @xcite presents a detailed discussion about the properties of dark matter particles , as well as the impact that the uncertainties of the dark matter parameters have on the evolution of the sun and stars .",
    "our evolution code is a modified version of the one - dimensional stellar evolution cesam .",
    "the code has up - to - date and very refined microscopic physics ( updated equation of state , opacities , nuclear reactions rates , and an accurate treatment of microscopic diffusion of heavy elements ) , including the solar mixture of @xcite .",
    "the solar models are calibrated to the present solar radius @xmath31 , luminosity @xmath32 , mass @xmath33 , and age @xmath34 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the models are required to have a fixed value of the photospheric ratio @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the mass fraction of hydrogen and the mass fraction of elements heavier than helium .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is determined according to the solar mixture proposed by @xcite .",
    "our reference model is a solar standard model @xcite that shows acoustic seismic diagnostics and solar neutrino fluxes identical to other solar standard models @xcite .",
    "we have computed the evolution of the sun in several dark matter particle scenarios , where @xmath25 takes values between @xmath6 and @xmath38 gev , and the spin - independent scattering cross - section @xmath26 takes values between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the spin - dependent scattering cross - section @xmath26 is approximately @xmath41 .",
    "this choice of parameters covers the parameter range of the experimental results of the direct dark matter searches discussed in the previous section .",
    "the sun evolves from the beginning of the pre - main sequence until its present age .",
    "each solar model has more than 2000 layers , and it takes more than 80 time steps to arrive at the present age . in the scenarios where a large amount of dark matter is captured , a single solar model can have more than 140 time steps before arriving at the present sun . at each epoch ,",
    "the structure equations are solved with an accuracy of @xmath42 .",
    "for each set of dark matter parameters , a solar - calibrated model is obtained by automatically adjusting the helium abundance and the convection mixing length parameter until the total luminosity and the solar radius are within @xmath42 of the present solar values .",
    "typically , a calibrated solar model is obtained after a sequence of 10 intermediate solar models , although the models with a large concentration of dark matter need more than 20 intermediate models . in the next section ,",

    "oxygen ( cno ) cycle ( 2% ) . accordingly to the modern theory of neutrino oscillations @xcite , solar neutrinos fluctuate between three possible flavors during their travel throughout space .",
    "although solar neutrinos are generated in the sun s core with electron flavor , depending on their energy , a significant part of them are converted into another flavor . the conversion from electron flavor",
    "is accomplished by means of two possible mechanisms : the neutrino vacuum oscillations and the mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein ( msw ) neutrino oscillations or matter neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the change of structure of the solar core , caused by the presence of dark matter , leads to variations of the temperature and density profiles , which in turn produce a visible variation in the production of neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "this variation in the neutrino fluxes is mainly caused by a change in the rate of the production of neutrinos , due to the decrease of the local temperature .",
    "this process is accompanied by a small increase of the density profile , for which the impact on the msw neutrino oscillation mechanism is negligible .",
    "for this reason , we will restrict our analysis to the total neutrino flux production and neglect the contribution to neutrino oscillations .    in the sun s core",
    ", the neutrino emission regions occur in a sequence of shells , following closely the location of nuclear reactions , orderly arranged in a sequence of decreasing temperatures , from the center towards the surface . in the case of our solar standard model ,",

    "figure  [ fig - neut1 ] shows the location of the different neutrino emission regions for several nuclear reactions .",
    "the presence of dark matter particles inside the star produces significant modifications of the solar neutrino fluxes ( see figure  [ fig - neut2 ] ) , caused by the reduction of the temperature and by changes in the neutrino emission regions ( see figure  [ fig - neut1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 nuclear reactions have neutrino emission regions that extend from the center up to 30% and 25% of the solar radius .",

    ", the @xmath2b and @xmath19be neutrino emission shells with a width of 15% and 22% of the solar radius have slightly changed the location of their maxima .",
    "this effect has a strong impact on the neutrino fluxes from these nuclear reactions ( see figure  [ fig - neut2 ] ) , since the @xmath45 neutrino flux dependence on the central temperature @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath47 and @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath45 and @xmath43 neutrino fluxes are presented as a variation relative to the values of the neutrino fluxes in the solar standard model . this procedure facilitates the comparison of these results with the data from the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) and borexino detectors .",
    "the current neutrino experiments suggests that the expected value for the @xmath2b neutrino flux in the case of no neutrino oscillations ( or electron neutrinos ; including the theoretical uncertainty on the @xmath2b flux in the solar standard model ) is @xmath65 for the sno experiment @xcite , and @xmath66 for the borexino experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the borexino experiment measures @xmath19be solar neutrino rates with an accuracy better than @xmath67 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath19be neutrino flux @xmath68 , under the assumption of the msw - lma scenario of solar neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "these values are in agreement with the neutrino predictions of the current solar standard model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the sun s core seems to be slightly hotter than expected , since the @xmath69 value measured by borexino and sno is higher than the value predicted by the current solar standard model .",
    "this discrepancy is larger in the case of borexino than for the sno measurement .",
    "furthermore , this result is validated by the borexino measurement of @xmath70 which is sensitive to a region slightly off the sun s center ( see figure  [ fig - neut1 ] ) .",
    "recently , the borexino experiment made the first measurement of the @xmath18 neutrinos , @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this preliminary measurement of @xmath49 also indicates that the sun is hotter than the solar standard model .",
    "this diagnostic is very interesting because @xmath49 is strongly dependent on the luminosity of the star .",
    "therefore , it is an indirect measurement of the total energy ( luminosity ) produced in the nuclear region , without the complications related with the transport of energy by radiation and convection of the more external layers of the star .",
    "once the accuracy is improved in such measurements , this will be a powerful test to the nuclear region of solar models .",
    "dark matter particles with masses smaller than 5 gev are not considered because evaporation becomes important and a large number of dark matter particles then escape the gravitational field of the star , significantly reducing the impact on the sun s core @xcite .",
    "dark matter particles with masses above @xmath7 gev produce a very small dark matter core and their effect in the sun s structure diminishes rapidly , leading to variations of at most a few percent on the predicted neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the light dark matter particles with masses between 5 and 12 gev , the size of the affected core region is comparable to that of the neutrino generation region , thus reducing the neutrino count expected to be measured in the terrestrial neutrino detectors .",
    "figure  [ fig - neut3 ] shows a systematic study of the dark matter parameter space by varying the mass @xmath25 and the spin - independent scattering cross - section @xmath27 of the dark matter particles .",
    "a set of more than a hundred solar models was computed for different dark matter parameters .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with previous results in the case of the spin - dependent scattering cross - section @xcite . in the @xmath25 vs. @xmath27 plane ,",
    "the iso - contours corresponding to @xmath45 and @xmath43 show variations up to 50% and 30% relatively to the solar standard model . the @xmath45 variation is larger than @xmath43 , because @xmath2b neutrinos are produced in a more central region than @xmath19be neutrinos , and therefore have a larger sensitivity ( see figure  [ fig - neut2 ] ) .",
    "the current modeling of the microscopic physics ( nuclear reactions rates , microscopic diffusion , radiative transfer and elemental abundances ) in the sun presents some significant uncertainties in the neutrino fluxes and acoustic mode predictions .",
    "nevertheless , several authors @xcite have shown that the largest contribution to the theoretical uncertainties comes from new measurements of the surface elemental abundances .",
    "indeed , the scientific community agrees that the new abundance determinations are the most reliable .",
    "if we consider the combined experimental and theoretical uncertainties of @xmath45 to be of the order of 15% , i.e. @xmath72 , then the dark matter particles for which the variation of @xmath45 is larger than 15% can be excluded .",
    "this corresponds approximately to rejecting dark matter particle candidates with low mass and large scattering cross - sections , i.e. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2b flux variation is equivalent to a variation of the central temperature , @xmath75 to be of @xmath76 .",
    "assuming that the other neutrino flux sources are affected by the same uncertainty , the dark matter candidates excluded have @xmath77 and @xmath18 neutrino fluxes , such as @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",

    "the current positive detections of dark matter experiments such as dama / libra and cogent occur for values of @xmath27 that do not affect the evolution of the sun , @xmath80 .",
    "this situation has changed with a new interpretation of the experimental data results , which evokes the possibility that if dark matter interactions with ordinary matter do not conserve iso - spin , as several authors have showed , then all the direct detection experimental data can be reconciled ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other processes such as inelastic scatterings and channeling , velocity - dependent form factors and momentum - dependent form factors are among the various processes that may significantly increase the value of the spin - independent scattering cross - section of the dark matter particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such new models suggest that the dark matter particle candidates have @xmath27 values within reach of the solar neutrino experiments , @xmath81 .    in the near future with the improvement of the sensitivity of the detectors",
    ", it will be possible to reduce the uncertainties in the @xmath45 , @xmath43 and @xmath49 , as well as to measure the neutrino fluxes produced in the cno cycle .",
    "the cno neutrino fluxes can provide an additional test of the accretion of dark matter in the sun s core , once the @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 electronic neutrino fluxes have a dependence on @xmath46 of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , identical to or larger than the neutrino fluxes of @xmath2b @xcite .",
    "the high - statistics data expected to be collected by the upgraded versions of present neutrino detectors , such as the sno and borexino , or even more so by the new neutrino detector low energy neutrino astrophysics ( lena ) , would allow a precise determination of such solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "it is expected that lena will allow measurement of @xmath2b neutrinos with a precision of 1% @xcite . as illustrated in figure  [ fig - neut4 ] ,",
    "if an error bar of 2% in the measurement of @xmath45 is obtained at the experimental level , this will allow us to infer an even more significant constraint on the parameters of possible dark matter particles .",
    "such detailed determinations of neutrino fluxes by future neutrino experiments will provide the means to precisely probe the central sun s core temperature , and by doing so , the contents of dark matter .",
