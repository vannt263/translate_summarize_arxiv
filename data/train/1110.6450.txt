    "the generation of massively entangled states is of great importance for quantum information . for quantum communication ,",
    "good examples are multiparty quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum secret sharing @xcite . for measurement - based quantum computing ,",
    "cluster states @xcite are known to enable one - way quantum computing @xcite .",
    "constructing large - scale quantum registers and processors is therefore one of the prime objectives of experimental quantum information , along with the suppression or alleviation of decoherence .    in most cases , the approach to scaling up",
    "the size of quantum registers or processors is a `` bottom - up '' one , in which individual qbits ( following mermin s more harmonious spelling @xcite ) are put together to form , say , an entangled quantum register @xcite .",
    "now , there are , indeed , extremely few examples of `` top - down '' approaches to multipartite entanglement , in which a single physical system enables intrinsic generation of multipartite entanglement over a large scale . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there are but two such systems .",
    "the first one is the individually trapped atoms in an optical lattice initially loaded with a bose - einstein condensate subsequently undergoing a mott insulator transition @xcite .",
    "the second one is the ensemble of entangled quantum modes of light , a.k.a .",
    "`` qmodes , '' defined by the resonant frequencies  or quantum optical frequency comb ( qofc)of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , in which the qofc is entangled by the opo s nonlinear crystal @xcite .",
    "recently , the simultaneous generation of 15 identical quadripartite `` square '' cluster states was realized experimentally over 60 qmodes of a single opo @xcite .",
    "the qofc entanglement experiments mentioned above necessitate an exquisitely sophisticated opo @xcite , operated below threshold @xcite , and in which two or three different nonlinear interactions must be phasematched @xcite .    in this paper , we present the theoretical discovery of massive multipartite entanglement generation in a much simpler system and in a completely different regime .",
    "the system is but a standard opo , in which only one nonlinear interaction is phasematched .",
    "in addition , the opo must be operated well above threshold .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that such a simple , well - known system might lend itself to the generation of such an exotic quantum state as a massively multipartite one .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that the entangling interaction is only pairwise .",
    "it is the fact that all entangled pairs are derived from the same , strongly depleted pump field that generates the multipartite entanglement by way of a _ bona fide _ 3-field hamiltonian .",
    "this is therefore a fundamentally different situation from that of the below - threshold opo in which pairwise interactions are chained and all their pump fields are undepleted , yielding quadratic nonlinear interactions @xcite in lieu of cubic ones .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the system hamiltonian , distinguishing between the depleted and undepleted pump cases . in section 3",
    ", we solve the equations of motion for the system by employing a linearization procedure .",
    "we are certainly aware that more sophisticated treatments exist @xcite and may indeed be interesting to use in order to explore this system further .",
    "in particular , it is worth mentioning the new physics of noncritical squeezing generation  that is , squeezing independent of the system parameters such as pump amplitude  in the transverse spatial modes of an opo , which was recently predicted via the phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite and pump clamping @xcite , the latter having already been observed in the laboratory @xcite . also , in this novel regime , the well - known , laser - like ( and usually slow ) phase diffusion process of an opo @xcite becomes entwined with the squeezed variables and affects detection @xcite , which is nt usually the case in a critically squeezing two - mode opo @xcite .",
    "as the present paper does nt pertain to noncritical squeezing , we have set aside this issue of phase diffusion for further studies , under the hypothesis that its effect may be similar to that in the usual critical squeezing situation .",
    "we therefore focus here on the nontrivial new results obtained from the simple approach adopted here . in section 4 ,",
    "we use the multipartite inseparability criterion derived by van loock and furusawa @xcite to establish the existence of multipartite entanglement in the optical frequency comb of a single opo .",
    "we then conclude .",
    "we consider the simplest possible case of an opo with a single , nondegenerate nonlinear interaction . in this case",
    "the interaction - picture hamiltonian is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the classical ( real ) and constant ( undepleted ) pump field ( in practice a stable , narrow - linewidth , continuous - wave laser ) and @xmath2 are the photon annihilation operators of entangled qmodes @xmath3 , of frequencies @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pump frequency ( see )    .",
    "the green arrow symbolizes the pump field , placed at half its frequency for clarity . ]    and @xmath6 is the free spectral range of the opo cavity .    below the opo emission threshold , such a system is known to emit two - mode squeezed fields which demonstrate the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox @xcite . above the opo threshold , the undepleted classical pump approximation can still be taken to hold and the generation of epr states has also been shown to be possible , theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite",
    ".    however , the undepleted classical pump approximation breaks down if the external pump power is increased significantly above threshold . in that case , the pump must be treated as a quantum field in the three - wave mixing interaction @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the annihilation operator of the pump field .",
    "recently , it was predicted @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite that the pump field participates in three - way entanglement in this case .",
    "another interesting theoretical analysis showed that the signal fields from two opos pumped by the same field could become entangled @xcite . here , we extend this analysis to the qofc of a _ single _ opo , in which a vast number of different qmode pairs are already known to be entangled by their parametric downconversion from the pump field @xcite . in the undepleted pump approximation ,",
    "all epr pumps are independent . however ,",
    "when one considers the opo well above threshold , there is but a single quantum pump field , whose strong ( ideally total ) depletion entail strong correlations between the epr fields , since a pump photon downconverting into one qmode pair will necessarily _ not _ be downconverted into any other pair .",
    "this paper posits that this situation should yield multipartite , rather than bipartite , quantum correlations and our goal is to ascertain whether they result in multipartite entanglement , which they do .      as mentioned before , we consider the simplest possible case of an opo cavity with a single pump mode and a single nondegenerate interaction in its nonlinear crystal .",
    "such a crystal implements the hamiltonian of .",
    "we assume a single two - mirror standing wave cavity , with one mirror of reflectivity @xmath9 for all modes and the other an output coupler of @xmath10 .",
    "taking into account the vacuum modes @xmath11 that enter the cavity through its output coupler , the input - output theory @xcite can be used to derive the equations of motion for the internal cavity modes @xmath12 here @xmath13 are the loss rates of the cavity mirror for mode @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the cavity round trip time . in order to solve we",
    "first rewrite field operators as centered fluctuations about their expectation value @xmath16      the semiclassical , or mean value , equations follow directly from : @xmath17 now , considering same cavity losses for all signal modes , @xmath18 , the stationary solutions of the two coupled equations for semi - classical mean values are @xmath19 this results in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the respective phases of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath27 real and positive therefore based on , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the stationary solution for the pump field s mean value can then be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 clearly , the right - hand side of must be positive and @xmath32 defines the threshold pump field @xmath33 hence , @xmath34 is also the pump to threshold power ratio .",
    "the classical signal amplitudes are weakly set by .",
    "the stability of the steady - state solution can be determined by a linearized analysis for small perturbations : @xmath35 substituting into , we get @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the number of signal and idler pairs considered inside the cavity . defining @xmath39 we can rewrite in block matrix form : @xmath40 we derived the eigenvalues of the matrix in for @xmath41 . in all these cases , the eigenvalue sets have the following form : @xmath42 where , posing the pump - signal loss ratio @xmath43 , @xmath44}\\right ) \\label{eq : stab12}\\\\ \\lambda_{3,4}&=-\\frac{1}{2 } k_a \\left ( \\kappa+2 \\pm \\sqrt{(\\kappa+2)^2 - 8 n \\sqrt{\\sigma } } \\right ) .",

    "show that , as the number of times above threshold @xmath47 increases , one can always find negative values for @xmath48 by increasing the pump - signal loss ratio @xmath49 , thereby tending towards the doubly resonant opo , which is always stable .",
    "now , we rewrite for the quantum fluctuations around these classical mean values .",
    "notice @xmath50 , @xmath51 we introduce the generalized field quadrature operators as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "however , we can assume any ratio between the classical mean values , as long as they satisfy @xmath65 , . therefore the variances of squeezed and antisqueezed quadratures are @xmath66 which yields the classic epr result at threshold ( @xmath32 ) , the generation of @xmath38 independent entangled @xmath67 pairs .",
    "however , if the opo is above threshold ( @xmath68 ) , the variance of the phase sum , will increase from zero @xcite and will eventually stop being squeezed .",
    "it states the well - known fact that for the opo operating well above the emission threshold , twin pairs are not independent epr pairs due to the pump statistics , unless @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the mechanism that we rely upon to create multipartite entanglement in this work .",
    "we give two preliminary examples before turning to the evaluation of precise multimode entanglement criteria .",
    "we give two examples of squeezed multimode operators which will be useful in the next section .",
    "first off , specifically combining phase sum operators of two pairs @xmath14 and @xmath70 yields @xmath71 even though phase sum operators for each pair become noisier with increasing input pump , this noise can be canceled appropriate linear combinations .",

    "when @xmath47 increases , the variance of @xmath76 increases from zero and approaches the shot noise level .",
    "however , the variance of @xmath72 , not squeezed at threshold , subsequently drops from the shot noise level ( of value 1 in this graph ) and shows squeezing . in this particular graph ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath77 $ ] occurs at @xmath78 but , in general , the value of @xmath47 for which the blue curve reaches its minimum , as well as the value of the minimum itself , depends on the choice of @xmath79 . ]    in we plot its variance as a function of @xmath47 , for @xmath75 .",
    "this graph clearly shows that the assumption of the existence of a correlation between all modes and the pump is a sensible one .",
    "having established this , we turn to directly testing the existence of multipartite entanglement in our system .",
    "the van loock - furusawa ( vlf ) multipartite entanglement criterion @xcite is the multipartite generalization of the duan @xcite - simon @xcite criterion , itself the continuous - variable formulation of the peres @xcite - horodecki @xcite positive partial transpose criterion . a density operator is partially separable if and only if it can be written as the convex sum @xmath80 where the mode set @xmath81 is separable from the mode set @xmath82 . if we define two `` entanglement witnesses , '' quadrature operators with arbitrary real parameter sets @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 then the separable density operator of must verify the vlf inequality @xcite @xmath86 whose violation implies the existence of entanglement between mode set ( @xmath87,  ,@xmath88 ) and mode set ( @xmath89,  ,@xmath90 ) .",
    "operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 were coined _ variance - based entanglement witnesses for continuous - variable systems _ by hyllus and eisert @xcite , in reference to the original qbit expectation - value - based entanglement witnesses @xcite .      in order to demonstrate multipartite entanglement",
    ", we examine the conditions for violation of _ all _ possible vlf inequalities , corresponding to all possible respective mode partitions such as , and their associated experimental regimes .",
    "we first consider the separability of the sole pump mode from all signal modes .",
    "we define @xmath93 and @xmath94 as @xmath95 with the real parameter @xmath96 .",
    "based on , the separability of mode @xmath8 implies @xmath97 here , and in the following , we make the assumption that all classical amplitudes @xmath98 are equal , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this does nt lessen the generality of our treatment but makes numerical evaluations easier . under this assumption",
    ", we get @xmath99 displays the maximum violation of the above inequality versus @xmath38 and @xmath47 , for optimized values of the arbitrary weight @xmath79 .",
    "as can be seen , there always exist values of @xmath100 for which @xmath101 is negative , which proves the inseparability of the pump mode from the signal modes .",
    "unsurprisingly , entangling a larger number of pairs ( @xmath38 ) requires a higher pump to threshold power ratio ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , a large pump power ( @xmath47 ) does degrade the inseparability , which might just be due to the increasing depletion of the intracavity pump field .",
    "we now study the inseparability of an entangled pair @xmath102 from the rest of the signals and the pump .",
    "for such a partition , we define @xmath103 and the vlf inequality is @xmath104 shows the violation of this inequality for a broad range of parameters .",
    "it also demonstrates the necessity of applying larger input pump intensity when considering more pairs inside the cavity in order to generate inseparability between all pairs , again unsurprisingly .",
    "we next turn to partitions @xmath105 .",
    "the operators are @xmath106 and the vlf inequality is @xmath107 assuming @xmath108 , then it is straightforward to show that @xmath109 . as a consequence",
    ", the vlf inequality @xmath110 is automatically violated when vlf inequality @xmath111 is , and does not need to be considered separately .      finally , we consider partitions of a single signal mode , or several such , all belonging to different epr pairs @xmath67 . because the signal mode @xmath112 is highly entangled to the mode @xmath113and to all other signals by virtue of the preceding  the separability test is simple in the present case .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the necessary vlf inequality for the partition @xmath114 ,    @xmath115    is always violated in the presence of single epr pair entanglement .",
    "this is because the left hand side term of contains epr nullifiers @xcite , a.k.a .",
    "epr entanglement witnesses , whose squeezed variances tend toward zero . the inseparability of any other form of partitions on modes when modes @xmath116 and @xmath117 are placed in different partitions , can be examined by inequalities similar to @xmath118 and with nonzero boundaries .",
    "such inequalities are always violated .",
    "therefore , if epr entanglement is present ( the checking of which is a staple of the experimental calibration of a regular two - mode squeezer ) , then the violation of both @xmath119 and @xmath111 is a necessary and sufficient condition to mode inseparability for all possible partitions in the optical frequency comb of a single opo .",
    "here we ask the question of the possibility of multipartite entanglement between twins without considering the pump field . for that",
    ", we rewrite inequality @xmath111 without the pump quadratures : @xmath120 with @xmath121    , versus @xmath47 , the pump to threshold power ratio , and @xmath38 , the number of mode pairs inside the cavity , for @xmath63 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 . ]    in , we plot the violation of this inequality .",
    "as can be seen by comparing with , inequality @xmath124 requires slightly larger @xmath47 to be violated , compared to @xmath111 , for small values of n. it shows we need to pump harder ( and get closer to total depletion ) in order to see pure entanglement between twin pairs .",
    "the arguments of subsections and [ sec : epr ] and [ sec : nonepr ] may be reused here to complete the inseparability proof .      a valid question is whether the entanglement witnesses that were derived here on the basis of physical considerations , namely the pump - depletion - induced correlations between epr pairs , are in fact the optimal entanglement witnesses for the system . in other words ,",
    "do different observables exist that would lead to even more strongly violated vlf inequalities ? answering this question should , in turn , inform on what type of entangled state is really generated here .",
    "the search for optimal entanglement witnesses was addressed by hyllus and eisert , using semidefinite programming procedures @xcite .",
    "while the scope of the present paper is limited to this successful demonstration of large - scale entanglement in a simple opo , the exact nature of the quantum state generated is clearly an interesting followup question , on which light can be shed by seeking the optimal entanglement witnesses and checking whether they are different from the ones derived above .",
    "we showed that a single opo operating well above threshold can generate multipartite entanglement in its quantum optical frequency comb .",
    "we verified the multipartite nature of the entanglement by evaluating the van loock - furusawa separability criterion over all possible qmode partitions .",
    "we showed that all of these vlf inequalities can be violated , for an arbitrary large number of pairs @xmath38 , simply by increasing the input pump power higher above threshold .",
    "while the presence of multipartite entanglement in such a simple system is a remarkable feature , it is important to keep in mind that the exact _ type _ of entanglement that is produced here ( ghz , w , cluster ) is difficult to determine .",
    "the search for optimal entanglement witnesses for this system is a promising approach to illuminate this question .",
    "note that previous work has shown that multipartite _ cluster - state _ generation , which was experimentally demonstrated in a single opo below threshold @xcite , should actually fail above threshold @xcite .",
    "however , the multipartite entanglement that we discovered in the simple opo above threshold would certainly be useful for quantum communication applications , such as quantum secret sharing .",
