    "in 1978 fisher and de gennes @xcite realized that when thermal fluctuations are restricted by a container a force acts on the walls of the container . since this effect is rather similar to the casimir effect , where the restriction of quantum fluctuations induces a force , it is called `` thermodynamic '' casimir effect . since thermal fluctuations only extend to large scales in the neighbourhood of a continuous phase transitions it is also called `` critical '' casimir effect . recently",
    "this effect has attracted much attention , since it could be verified for various experimental systems and quantitative predictions could be obtained from monte carlo simulations of spin models @xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit of the three dimensional system , the correlation length , which measures the spatial extension of fluctuations ,",
    "diverges following the power law @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the reduced temperature and @xmath18 the critical temperature . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the amplitudes of the correlation length in the high and low temperature phase , respectively . while @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend on the microscopic details of the system , the critical exponent @xmath6 and the ratio @xmath21 are universal . at the critical point also",
    "other quantities like the specific heat show a singular behaviour : @xmath22 in the case of the xy universality class that we consider here , the exponent @xmath23 @xcite of the specific heat is negative .",
    "therefore the analytic background @xmath24 has to be taken into account .",
    "note that the critical exponents of the correlation length and the specific heat are related by the hyperscaling relation @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dimension of the system . for reviews on critical phenomena and its modern theory ,",
    "the renormalization group , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the singular behaviour at the critical point originates from the fact that thermal fluctuations range over all length scales .",
    "therefore the behaviour in the neighbourhood of the critical point is modified if the system is confined by a container .",
    "a priori thermodynamic quantities are functions of the reduced temperature and the size @xmath4 of the container , assuming a fixed geometry .",
    "however the theory of finite size scaling predicts that the physics of the system is governed by the ratio @xmath27 as long as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the microscopic scale of the system . in particular",
    "if a quantity in the thermodynamic limit behaves as @xmath30 , finite size scaling predicts that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the critical exponent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 the correlation length of the bulk system .",
    "we can rewrite this equation as @xmath35^{1/\\nu})\\ ] ] by using  ( [ xipower ] ) , which is the form used in the following .",
    "note that the function @xmath36 depends on the details of the container .",
    "for example for a cube it is different from a thin film .",
    "it also depends on the type of boundary conditions that is imposed by the walls of the container on the order parameter of the system .",
    "the predictions of finite size scaling theory have been tested in experiments and theoretical studies for various universality classes and confining geometries ; for reviews see @xcite . here",

    "very precise experimental results for critical exponents and universal amplitude ratios were obtained for this phase transition @xcite .",
    "also a large number of experiments on thin films of @xmath10he and @xmath37he-@xmath10he mixtures were performed to probe finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "in particular the specific heat @xmath38 of thin films has been studied .",

    "note that in the case of thin films we consider , following the literature on the thermodynamic casimir effect , free energies per area .",
    "we hope that this does not lead to confusion , since in the case of the specific heat , energies per volume are considered .    from a thermodynamic point of view",
    ", the casimir force per unit area is given by @xmath46 where @xmath4 is the thickness of the film .",

    "in order to get a vanishing order parameter as it is observed at the boundaries of @xmath10he films , dirichlet boundary conditions with vanishing field were imposed . in singular quantities these lead to corrections @xmath52 @xcite , which can be expressed by an effective thickness @xmath53 . in @xcite",
    "we find @xmath54 for the model that we consider here .",
    "note that the boundary conditions also effect the analytic background of the specific heat and the energy density , which also leads to corrections @xmath52 .",
    "however it turns out that these corrections are not given by the same @xmath55 as for the singular quantities . taking into account these subtleties we arrive at accurate result for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "in particular for @xmath0 in the range @xmath56 we find a good match with our previous result @xcite , with previous ones obtained from simulations of the xy model @xcite and experiments on thin films of @xmath10he @xcite ; overall we find a reasonable agreement . ] where we computed the casimir force by taking the derivative of the excess free energy with respect to the thickness @xmath4 of the film .",
    "next we compute @xmath0 by using experimental results for the excess specific heat obtained from experiments on thin films of @xmath10he @xcite .",
    "even though this is a quite simple exercise , to our knowledge , it has not been done before .",
    "for @xmath57 we find a reasonable match with our result @xcite .",
    "however in the low temperature phase , for @xmath58 we get results that strongly deviate from @xcite and can be ruled out by plausibility .",
    "this corroborates the observation that in the low temperature phase for @xmath58 the excess specific heat does not scale well @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first we define the model and the observables that we consider .",

    "in fact , following @xcite , it should be by at least a factor 20 smaller than for the standard xy model .    in @xcite",

    "it has been noticed @xcite that for @xmath58 , in particular in the neighbourhood of the minimum , the results obtained for different thicknesses differ by quite large factors . in @xcite we have computed the specific heat and the scaling function @xmath12 starting from the data for the energy density discussed above .",
    "we find that for @xmath58 our final result is clearly smaller than the experimental ones @xcite .",

    "we have computed @xmath0 which we have plotted in figure [ experimentalm ] .    in order to check the effect of errors due to the finite step - size of the integration",

    "we have fitted the data for the specific heat in the neighbourhood of the transition with the ansatz @xmath233 then we have integrated the ansatz in the neighbourhood of the transition and compared it with the corresponding result from the trapezoidal rule .",
    "we find that the numerical results only change little and the conclusions drawn below are not effected .",
    "let us now discuss the results that we have obtained : for @xmath234 the curve is monotonically decreasing with decreasing @xmath60 ; in particular no minimum of the function can be observed . for @xmath235 a shallow",
    "minimum occurs at @xmath236 ; for @xmath237 the function is decreasing again with decreasing @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath238 we see a clear minimum at @xmath239 ; however the value of the minimum is clearly smaller than the one of @xcite . in the case of @xmath240 and @xmath241",
    "we find a quite good match with our result @xcite down to @xmath242 .",
    "for @xmath241 the minimum is located at @xmath243 and the value of the minimum is @xmath244 . for @xmath241",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath245 and the value of the minimum is @xmath246 . for @xmath240",
    "no data for @xmath247 are available . for @xmath241",
    "the curve is decreasing again for @xmath248 with decreasing @xmath60 . up to here the expectation that with increasing thickness of the film the result converges toward the universal scaling function is fulfilled .",
    "however for the largest thicknesses studied , @xmath227 even the worst mismatch is found .",
    "the curve is monotonically decreasing with decreasing @xmath60 and even for @xmath249 there is quite large mismatch with our result for @xmath8 @xcite . playing around with the data , one finds that smaller values of @xmath11 for @xmath58 are needed to avoid that @xmath8 is decreasing with decreasing @xmath60 for @xmath58 .",
    "one should note that eq .",
    "( [ important ] ) only holds for the scaling limit .",
    "therefore the observations made here are not an indication that the experimental data are effected by an error .",
    "they can also be explained by corrections to the scaling behaviour .",
    "this is at least true for the smaller thicknesses like @xmath234 .",
    "the result for @xmath227 is more puzzling .",
    "one should note that the analysis presented in this section does not depend on the type of boundary conditions that is realized in the experiment .",
    "but we think that the behaviour of @xmath0 for @xmath58 obtained here can not be explained by different boundary conditions from those used in the study of the lattice model @xcite .",
    "we have studied the relation of the excess specific heat , the excess energy and the thermodynamic casimir force in thin films in the three - dimensional xy universality class .",
    "to this end we have exploited the relation  ( [ important ] ) @xmath250 among the finite size scaling functions @xmath0 of the thermodynamic casimir force , @xmath2 of the excess free energy and @xmath1 of the excess energy .",
    "we have analysed data obtained for the energy density of the improved two - component @xmath9 model on the simple cubic lattice and experimental results for the specific heat of thin films of @xmath10he near the @xmath15-transition @xcite .    as a first exercise",
    "we have computed the functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 for a finite lattice of the size @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions in all directions . this way we avoid potential problems related with the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition of the thin film and corrections caused by dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "indeed we find a good collapse of the data already for rather small lattice sizes @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "next we have repeated the same exercise for films with free boundary conditions using the data for the excess energy density obtained in @xcite .",
    "here we find a huge mismatch between the thicknesses @xmath139 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "replacing @xmath4 by @xmath151 with @xmath54 @xcite does not remove this discrepancy .",
    "we argue that the non - singular part of the energy density suffers from boundary corrections that are not described by the same @xmath175 which accounts for the corrections in singular quantities . indeed , the analysis of the energy density of films up to the thickness @xmath152 at the critical temperature of the three dimensional system results in a @xmath167 for the analytic background of the energy density that is clearly different from @xmath175 . taking into account this result we find a reasonable collapse of the functions obtained from @xmath139 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 in a large range of the scaling variable @xmath60 .    computing the casimir force from this result for @xmath1",
    "we find a good collapse for @xmath251 . in this range of @xmath60",
    "we also find a good agreement with the result for @xmath8 that we have obtained in @xcite .",
    "note that in particular the minimum of the scaling function @xmath8 is within this range .",
    "we confirm the position @xmath252 and the value @xmath253 that we have obtained in @xcite .",
    "next we took into account analytic corrects .",
    "the coefficients of these corrections were computed by matching the results obtained from @xmath143 and @xmath145 . this way we could extend the range of agreement with our previous result @xcite down to @xmath254 .",
    "we have presented a viable alternative to compute the scaling function @xmath8 of the casimir force . the nice agreement with our previous result @xcite",
    "gives us further confidence in the correctness of the results .",
    "finally we have computed the scaling function @xmath8 using experimental results for the excess specific heat @xcite . here",
    "we find a reasonable match with the theoretical results in the range @xmath229 .",
    "in particular we find evidence that the minimum of the scaling function @xmath8 is located at @xmath255 which is consistent with our prediction @xcite but slightly larger than @xmath256 @xcite and @xmath257 @xcite , where the thermodynamic casimir force has been determined for films of @xmath10he with thicknesses @xmath258 .    in the range @xmath58 the curves obtained from different thicknesses",
    "show quite different behaviour .",
    "furthermore in this range @xmath0 is decreasing with decreasing @xmath60 .",
    "this behaviour corresponds to too large values of @xmath11 in the range @xmath58 .",
