    "many field theories with varying numbers of supersymmetries and in various dimensions can be realized on the common directions of type ii branes . for a comprehensive review and references",
    "see @xcite . in four - dimensional @xmath0 theories",
    "the problem arises that not all global symmetries are fully realized .",
    "specifically , for an @xmath1 theory with @xmath5 massless flavors one expects @xmath6 chiral symmetry .",
    "however , in the iia brane construction of this theory only the diagonal @xmath7 is visible .",
    "this problem was first addressed in @xcite where it was pointed out that the full chiral symmetry can be restored under certain conditions .",
    "subsequently , many theories with full chiral symmetry and chiral matter content were constructed @xcite .",
    "more recently hanany and zaffaroni @xcite proposed a construction of chiral gauge theories using grids of ns fivebranes as well as d5 branes in type iib string theory .",
    "these constructions have the advantage that the full chiral symmetry is manifest .",
    "they also provide a method of constructing genuinely chiral theories , i.e. , theories for which no mass term can be added to the superpotential . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors consider these brane constructions at zero string coupling . in this case",
    "all branes meet at right angles or are parallel . at zero coupling there does not seem to be any obstacle in constructing anomalous gauge theories , such as an @xmath1 with only anti - fundamentals .    in this note , we take a first step towards an analysis of these brane configurations at finite string coupling . once the string coupling is switched on ,",
    "there are certain restrictions on the angles at which ns fivebranes and d5 branes can meet .",
    "this is quite familiar from the study of @xmath8-webs of fivebranes @xcite .",
    "past experience has shown that consistency conditions in string theory usually enforce such field theory requirements as the vanishing of anomalies . in this note",
    "we analyze the simplest case discussed in @xcite , an @xmath1 gauge theory with fundamental flavors , at finite string coupling .",
    "we propose consistency conditions based on the bending of the branes and show that they guarantee that the gauge theories are non - anomalous .",
    "they also restrict the number of flavors to @xmath2 , which excludes theories with instable vacua @xcite .",
    "there are qualitative differences between the brane constructions of @xmath1 theories with @xmath3 , which are asymptotically free , and the theories with @xmath4 , which are free in the infrared .",
    "the consistency conditions also help to explain the origin of some puzzling properties of the brane configurations at zero string coupling .",
    "these problems appear when we try to find seiberg s duality @xcite by moving the branes in the same way as in the type iia construction of these @xmath1 theories @xcite .",
    "we show two examples of these difficulties and demonstrate that the consistency conditions may offer a way to resolve them .",
    "following @xcite , we construct a 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory using type iib five - branes with world volumes : ns(012345 ) , ns(012367 ) , d5(012346 ) .",
    "the ns and ns branes bound the d5 branes in the 4 and 6 direction as shown in fig .",
    "if we stack @xmath9 d5 branes on top of each other in the finite box we get the desired @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "matter in the fundamental representation can be included by placing additional d5 branes in the semi - infinite boxes surrounding the box with the @xmath9 finite branes . as indicated in the figure , we place an arbitrary number of semi - infinite d5 branes in each of these boxes . at finite string coupling",
    "there will be consistency conditions that restrict these numbers .",
    "we can determine the ( chiral ) matter content of this theory using the rules listed in @xcite .",
    "the angle at which the d5 and ns branes intersect is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "( see @xcite for details . )",
    "this condition ensures that no additional supersymmetries are broken . for @xmath12 , @xmath13",
    "all branes meet at right angles , but for finite string coupling the angles are determined by the @xmath8 charges of the branes involved . the arguments in this section do not depend on the value of the string coupling as long as it is not zero .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows three slices in the @xmath14 plane through the configuration in fig .",
    "figures [ fig2]a , b , c show @xmath15 positions to the left of the two ns branes , between the ns branes , and to the right of the ns branes respectively .",
    "the angles are determined by the number of d5 branes ending on each ns brane from above and below . for an arbitrary number of d5 branes in each of the semi - infinite boxes , the six angles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] will in general be different .",
    "= 15.cm = 7.cm    this requires that far out in the @xmath16 direction the ns brane is either discontinuous in the @xmath15 direction or , if the discontinuity is smoothed out , violates eq .",
    "( [ angle ] ) at least for some @xmath15 positions .",
    "there is an alternative way of looking at this . to the right of the d5 branes in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the ns branes look like @xmath17 branes with @xmath18 depending on the @xmath15 position",
    ". there are smooth paths along the ns branes to the right of the d5 branes in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , that connect patches with different @xmath18 s .",
    "since the @xmath8 charges are globally defined quantities , this is not necessarily inconsistent .",
    "however , far away from the finite d5 branes , we expect the angle of the @xmath8 brane to be given by its charges .",
    "for arbitrary charges , the @xmath8 brane would have different @xmath18 charges far out in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "we take these considerations to indicate that the three angles involving each of the ns branes have to be identical .",
    "this imposes the following restrictions on the numbers of branes we can put in the semi - infinite boxes : @xmath20    we can make an identical argument for the bending of the ns branes by considering slices in the @xmath21 plane at different @xmath22 positions .",
    "in order for the ns branes to bend in a consistent way , the numbers of semi - infinite d5 branes must satisfy @xmath23 it is interesting to note that this second set of conditions is linearly dependent on the first and does not impose any new constraints . solving these consistency conditions",
    "gives @xmath24 with @xmath25 arbitrary , and @xmath9 the number of colors .",
    "the rules given in @xcite can be used to find the matter content of this theory .",
    "the consistency conditions guarantee that the @xmath1 theory is anomaly free .",
    "there are @xmath26 flavors of fundamentals and anti - fundamentals .",
    "note that the minimum number of flavors in a consistent theory is @xmath9 .",
    "this agrees with the field theory analysis which shows that there is no stable vacuum for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "there is also a a qualitative change in the brane construction as the number of flavors exceeds @xmath28 . to see this ,",
    "consider a theory with @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the other semi - infinite boxes empty .",
    "this configuration satisfies our consistency conditions .",
    "it gives rise to an @xmath1 gauge theory with @xmath31 flavors .",
    "for @xmath27 the @xmath8 branes bend away from the stacks of @xmath9 d5 branes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but for @xmath32 both @xmath8 branes bend in the same directions in the @xmath33 plane .",
    "if @xmath34 , the two @xmath8 branes meet somewhere to the right of the d5 branes in fig .",
    "there are two inequivalent choices for the brane configurations to the right of the d5 branes .",
    "either the two @xmath8 branes merge to form a @xmath35 brane , or they intersect .",
    "both of these configurations differ from @xmath8-webs of fivebranes studied in @xcite by the presence of additional branes .",
    "an analysis of these configurations is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we simply note that no such configurations arise in brane constructions that give rise to asymptotically free theories with stable vacua .",
    "thus , the brane configuration in fig .  [ fig1 ] gives rise to the expected gauge theories for a total number of flavors between @xmath9 and @xmath28 . repeating this analysis for a general brane configuration that satisfies our consistency conditions yields a set of inequalities that give the constraint @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that in the general case , the @xmath8 branes also do not intersect unless the total number of flavors exceeds @xmath28 .",
    "thus the consistency conditions pick out those theories that have a stable vacuum and are asymptotically free .",
    "the consistency conditions help resolve some puzzling aspects of the theories one can construct at zero coupling . for instance , consider the theory obtained by setting @xmath37 and all other boxes empty .",
    "this theory is forbidden by our consistency conditions , but at zero coupling we expect to get an anomaly - free @xmath1 with @xmath5 flavors .",
    "for @xmath38 there should be a brane motion that yields seiberg s duality . in order to move the two ns branes past each other , we connect @xmath9 d5 branes across the left ns brane so that they extend from the right ns brane to infinity in the @xmath39 direction",
    ". then we move the two ns branes to different @xmath16 positions , move them past each other in the @xmath15 direction and bring them back to the same @xmath16 location .",
    "the result of this operation is a brane configuration of the kind shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with @xmath40 and gauge group @xmath41 .",
    "according to the rules in @xcite this theory is anomalous , since it has @xmath42 fundamentals and @xmath5 anti - fundamentals . instead of the expected seiberg - duality @xcite , we found a brane motion that transforms an anomaly free theory into an anomalous one .",
    "what went wrong ?",
    "at finite coupling we see that this brane configuration is inconsistent but even if it were consistent , the motion of the two ns branes past each other is possible only if the ns branes are planes .",
    "this requires that the same number of d5 branes end on each ns from above and below . in other words",
    ", we must require that @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "while these conditions ensure that this brane motion does not create anomalous theories , it does not yield the expected result for the dual description of the @xmath1 gauge theory .    to see this in some more detail ,",
    "consider the theory with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the two ns branes are planes , so there is no impediment to moving the ns branes in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "if we repeat the brane motion described above , we get a theory with @xmath46 , @xmath48 and gauge group @xmath41 .",
    "the original theory had @xmath31 flavors while the ` dual ' has @xmath49 flavors . also , instead of the expected gauge group @xmath7 the brane motion yields @xmath41 .",
    "= 7.cm    in this analysis",
    "we did not take the bending of the ns branes into account .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows a section in the @xmath50 plane of the initial brane configuration .",
    "the brane motion described above corresponds to exchanging the @xmath15 positions of the two ns branes .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show the final configuration . in order to obtain brane configurations that give rise to asymptotically free field theories",
    ", we require that the ns branes do not intersect before the brane motion . in the initial configuration",
    "this restricts @xmath5 to the range @xmath51 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , exchanging the @xmath15 positions of the ns branes requires that the @xmath8 branes intersect when they coincide in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "this is true for all values of @xmath5 except @xmath52 , which corresponds to parallel ns branes to the left and parallel @xmath8 branes to the right of the d5 branes .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that an intersection of @xmath8 branes can be viewed as a special case of a @xmath8 web theory with four external branes .",
    "we can replace the intersection point by a finite size face , because changing the size of a face in a @xmath8-web is a flat direction corresponding to a modulus in the five - dimensional theory on the intersection of the fivebranes .",
    "the resulting brane configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the dashed lines show one possible face that could replace the intersection of the @xmath8 branes .",
    "we can increase the size of the face until one edge of it touches the d5 branes .",
    "the massless states from strings stretched between the edge and the stacks of d5 branes are degrees of freedom in the four - dimensional field theory .",
    "an analysis of these effects is beyond the scope of this note , but these considerations suggest that we may need to modify the counting rules proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if there are extra intersections of @xmath8 branes .",
    "one possibility is , that the configurations before and after the brane motion give rise to the same field theory after the states from the intersection are included .",
    "we analyzed the type iib construction of four - dimensional @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theories at non - zero string coupling .",
    "the condition that no further supersymmetries be broken determines the angles at which ns and d5 branes can intersect . based on these conditions we obtained consistency requirements that constrain which gauge theories can be constructed in this approach .",
    "we found that the gauge theories are guaranteed to be non - anomalous and that the total number of flavors is restricted to the range @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "if the total number of flavors exceeds @xmath28 , extra intersections between @xmath8 branes appear and it is not clear what effect this has on the field theory .",
    "the iib construction without the extra intersections automatically gives rise only to asymptotically free theories with stable vacua .",
    "we also demonstrated that brane motions analogous to the iia brane motions that provide a string theory realization of seiberg s duality , naively give results that contradict the field theory expectations . at finite string coupling",
    ", these brane motions require that new intersections of @xmath8 branes appear .",
    "we argued that there may be additional massless states in the four - dimensional field theory that arise from these intersections .",
    "the results presented here are only a first step toward a more complete analysis .",
    "in particular , it would be very interesting to analyze theories with intersecting @xmath8 branes .",
    "this may shed some light on how to construct seiberg s duality in the iib framework .",
    "an analysis of the flat directions of these brane configurations would be useful .",
    "the zero coupling results may get modified when the bending of branes and the possibility of replacing intersections with faces is taken into account .",
    "another interesting question is , how to modify the consistency conditions to incorporate orientifolds .",
    "we hope to address some of these questions in the future .",
