    "the _ very _ center of our galaxy houses the variable source named sgr  a * , first discovered in the radio as a compact source @xcite .",
    "the fact that this source is motionless ( to better than 1 km / s ) at the dynamical center of the galaxy @xcite , and its coincidence with the common focus of elliptical orbits of stars tracked over the last decade and a half , clearly associates it with a supermassive black hole of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "sgr  a * has been detected across the electromagnetic spectrum , at radio , submm , nir and x - ray wavelengths . at nir and x - ray wavelengths",
    "@xcite the emission is highly variable ( factors up to @xmath2160 and 27 in the x - ray and nir respectively ; @xcite , this work ) compared to the comparatively steady emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "nir peaks are detected more often than in the x - ray ( peaks occur @xmath21 and 4 times a day for x - ray and nir variable emission , respectively ; @xcite ) .",
    "some nir flares have been detected without any accompanying x - ray flare @xcite .",
    "however , when both nir and x - ray exhibit increases in emission , the peaks in emission occur simultaneously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the near - infrared lightcurves from sgr  a * exhibit @xmath51  hour long increases in emission that are often called ` flares ' in the literature .",
    "a number of these have exhibited very suggestive substructural features with timescales of @xmath6  minutes @xcite , possibly quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) . however",
    "the existence of qpos and even the use of the term flare to describe the nir variability of sgr  a * has been questioned by @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) who argue that there is no true quasi - periodicity , just a variability process with a featureless red noise power spectrum ( e.g. a power spectrum @xmath7 where @xmath8 is frequency ) .",
    "a stochastic source with a red noise power spectrum has higher variability at longer timescales and could potentially be responsible for the structures on longer timescales seen in the real lightcurves .",
    "the authors suggest that apparent flare peaks may simply be the highest observed flux excursions in such a purely stochastic source and are not isolated events .    a main reason for the two rather contrasting interpretations of the variable emission from sgr  a * has been that the nature of the faint emission from sgr  a * and its relationship to the high flux emission is uncertain .",
    "the nir emission from the galactic center is dominated by the central cluster of bright stars , and adaptive optics at 8-meter class telescopes is required in order to separate the faint source sgr  a * from the closest s - stars ( even at this resolution sgr  a * is still on occasion confused with a relatively bright star ) .",
    "additional , faint stars may be present very close to sgr  a * which have not yet been tracked and identified as stars from astrometric monitoring programs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . while the dramatic high flux variability can be unambiguously attributed to the black hole , when a faint source is detected at the position of sgr  a * , it is not necessarily clear that the source is sgr  a * , faint stars , or a combination of both .",
    "accordingly , it is not clear whether sgr  a * continues to emit at all at low fluxes , whether it exhibits a ` quiescent state ' ( a non- or weakly active low state ) , or whether the low flux emission continues to vary constantly with the same statistical properties as the high flux emission .",

    "the close stellar sources are not as well separated from sgr  a * as with the vlt or keck telescopes , and the stars s17 and s2 overlap with the sgr  a * source in these observations .",
    "the flux distributions were fitted with a gaussian at low fluxes , which was attributed to the observational noise on constant sources ( the contribution from s2 , s17 and possible quiescent emission ) and a power - law at high fluxes , which was attributed to transient flares .",
    "the best fit models implied that sgr  a * was active ( above the noise at low levels ) more than 40% of the time .",
    "@xcite presented an analysis of six nights of k-band ( and one l-band ) observations at the keck observatory , using an unbiased set of observations taken between 2005 and 2007 .",
    "a source at the position of sgr  a * was always detected in this dataset , with an estimated maximum 35% contribution from stellar contamination .",
    "these authors reported that the source sgr  a * was continuously variable , based on the larger variance of sgr  a * compared to stars of similar brightness on five of the six k-band observation nights .",
    "this was the data set used to investigate timing properties of sgr  a * in which it was claimed the data set was consistent with a featureless red noise power spectrum with no quasi - periodicity .",
    "however , with a sum duration for the k - band observations of about 12.1 hours , this data set did not sample well the higher fluxes of sgr  a * , i.e. the source was relatively faint compared to publications where variable emission with suggestive quasi - periodic structure have been reported ( * ? ? ?",

    "all are reported in the literature with different calibrations / extinction values , and we have done our best to determine the corrections to scale them to the calibration and extinction values used in this paper .",
    "in section [ section_dataset ] we present our observations and the results of using two different methods of photometry : a six year lightcurve ( aperture photometry ) , and the 2009 data set ( psf photometry ) . in section [ section_results ]",
    "we present the flux distribution of sgr  a * and our results from various model fits to the flux distribution . in section [ section_discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results in the context of two variability states for sgr  a * : a low - level lognormally varying _ quiescent state _ and sporadic high flux _ flares_. we summarize in section [ section_conclusions ] .",
    "since 2002 we have observed the galactic center with the near - infrared adaptive optics - assisted diffraction limited imager naco at the vlt @xcite .",
    "much of the observation time 2002 - 2009 was spent concentrated on the central few arcesconds , measuring the positions of the s - stars and monitoring sgr  a*. by now we have amassed a large dataset with which we can investigate statistical properties of sgr  a * s variability . while we utilised l ( 3.8@xmath21 m ) , ks ( 2.18@xmath21 m ) and h ( 1.66@xmath21 m ) bands , by far the largest proportion of our data is taken in ks - band , collected in either 13  mas pixel scale imaging , 13  mas pixel scale polarimetry , or 27  mas pixel scale imaging mode .",
    "the presence of many stars close to the central black hole complicates the attempt to acquire accurate photometry for the near - infrared sgr  a * source .",
    "sgr  a * is usually fainter than the surrounding s - stars , and the stars _ move_.",
    "a star can on occasion get so close to sgr  a * in projection that the two sources become confused .",
    "for example , the @xmath516 year orbit star s2 @xcite was confused with sgr  a * as it passed pericenter in 2002 .",
    "more recently , the @xmath22  mag star s17 was confused with sgr  a * in 2006 - 2008 .",
    "we use two different methods in this paper :    1 .",
    "we first attempted to obtain as large a homogeneous , unbiased , dataset as possible , in order to obtain a best overview of the statistical properties of the variability of sgr  a * , and to address in particular the variability at ( the rarer ) high fluxes . to do this",
    "we used aperture photometry because this allowed us to address the most important complication to the photometry of sgr  a * in 2004 to 2009  the star s17 , confused with sgr  a * in 2006 - 2008 . to deal with s17 we used a two - aperture photometry method to determine the combined flux of sgr  a * and the star s17 in all years 2004 to 2009 with comparable accuracy .",
    "this is important because to understand the flux distribution we have to understand the photometric errors at low fluxes .",
    "if all years are measured with comparable accuracy the long - term errors can be well approximated with a gaussian ( with width dependent on flux ; see section [ section_obserrors ] ) .",
    "we did not include the ks - band data from 2002 - 2003 because the star s2 was so close to sgr  a * during this time that it contributed to the flux measured with this method .",
    "since s2 is much brighter than s17 the flux of sgr  a*+s17 could not be measured with an accuracy comparable to the other years .",
    "we secondly looked at a subset of the data in more detail in order to address the nature of the variability at low fluxes .",
    "determining the nature / existence of low level variability ( and in particular to distinguish it from observational errors ) requires more precise photometry than could be achieved with aperture photometry , in particular with the inclusion of s17 .",
    "we address the question of the nature of the low level variability by analyzing the ( high quality ) 2009 data , in which s17 is not confused with sgr  a * , in greater detail with a psf - fitting photometric method starfinder , @xcite ) .",
    "the flux errors for this method are much smaller and allow us to distinguish with more certainty between true variability and flux errors at low fluxes ; this data set is not completely unbiased since sgr  a * was only reliably detected in 87% of the selected images .    by using these two methods in combination",
    ", we can overcome the individual difficulties of the methods and piece together a consistent picture of the near - infrared variability of sgr  a*.      our 2004 - 2009 ks - band data set consists of @xmath23 images .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard way by applying a sky subtraction , a flat field correction and a hot / dead pixel correction ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we found it necessary to apply a quality cut to eliminate the worst data and ensure we obtained a homogeneous data set on which we could perform accurate photometry .",
    "this quality cut was carried out by eye , and the criteria for elimination included :    * the two calibration stars were not in the image ( this happened rarely , and only in the polarimetric data ) * image ghosts close to sgr  a * or psf artefacts * simply a bad quality image mostly corresponding to low strehl ratio data resulting from poor atmospheric conditions . the quality of images for this criterion was judged by the general visibility of s - stars , not by the visibility of sgr  a * to avoid bias towards bright fluxes from sgr  a*.    we additionally eliminated 854 images from july in 2009 which were taken in a triggered mode , so that our dataset remains unbiased and representative of the overall variability of sgr  a*. the remaining data set totaled 6774 images which were used to obtain a lightcurve for sgr  a*.    to extract fluxes for sgr  a * as well as for several control stars , we carried out aperture photometry on each image .",
    "however , if we used a standard circular aperture centred on sgr  a * , we would have a varying contribution from s17 ( the brightest star to be confused with sgr  a * 2004 - 2009 ) to the lightcurve as the star moves through the aperture during 2006 - 2008 .",
    "a second star within the aperture , but not centered within the aperture also increases the error on our measurements of the flux of sgr  a*. we would obtain more accurate results if s17 could somehow also be well - centered in the aperture at all times , as well as sgr  a*.    to solve the problem of s17 we thus used a two - aperture method with two circular sub - apertures , one centered on sgr  a * and one centered on s17 and measure their combined flux , averaging the results where the two sub - apertures are each 40 , 53 and 66  mas in size .",
    "we used this method for all data 2004 to 2009 , so that we always measure the combined flux of s17 + sgr  a*. while there may be additional effects due to confusion with other , fainter stars , at first order our method ensures that we measure the fainter fluxes of sgr  a * with similar measurement errors from year to year than we would have if we neglected to include a sub - aperture about s17 .",
    "to further ensure the self - consistency of our dataset , we used the same set of calibrator stars for calibration of each image .",
    "this restricted us to only two suitable calibration stars , s30 and s65 , due to the small field of view of some ( especially polarimetric ) images . to measure the raw counts of control stars and",
    "the calibration stars we used the same aperture as for sgr  a * and s17 , but centered the star in just one of the two sub - apertures . for each image ,",
    "the raw counts of sgr  a*/s17 and the control stars are then divided by the counts of the two calibrator stars and the calibrated counts are then flux calibrated by scaling relative to the median of s65 for the observation night , using @xmath24  mag for s65 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our photometric calibration is also consistent with @xcite ( s65 : @xmath25  mag ) . to convert magnitudes to fluxes ( mjy ) we used the zeropoint from @xcite ( @xmath26  mag corresponds to 667 jy ) .",
    "we computed the expected positions of sgr  a * and of the control stars using the orbital ( polynomial ) fits of @xcite . for polarimetric data",
    ", we added the raw photon counts recorded in the apertures for all targets in both ordinary and extraordinary images first in order to recover the unpolarized intensities from the ordinary image ) . ] , before the flux calibration was carried out .",
    "we dereddened the final flux values using @xmath27 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fritz 2010 in prep . ) . note that the absolute photometric calibration and extinction correction is not important for the analysis of relative fluxes presented in this paper , where we have focused on maximising the long - term relative accuracy of our photometric measurements . however , where we compare with previous publications , we additionally scale the reported fluxes to the photometric calibration ( as best as possible ) and extinction of this paper .    the lightcurve we produced in this way for sgr  a * is shown in figure [ fig_dataset ] .",
    "the data presented here is representative of the overall variability of sgr  a * since it is not biased towards the presence of obvious ` flare events ' and the only data selection carried out concerned data quality and photometric consistency as explained above .",
    "it is by far the most extensive dataset for sgr  a * that has been published : the observations we present here consist effectively a @xmath5184 hour long lightcurve ( if one subtracts from the total time all gaps larger than about 20  min , i.e. gaps not due to sky observations ) .",
    "the total amount of exposure time ( i.e. the time spent with the shutter open , excluding overheads ) is smaller , and totals @xmath272 hours , though 184 hours is a better indication of the amount of continuous coverage .    .",
    "this flare is the brightest ks - band flare that has ever been observed ; the source reached an intrinsic peak flux of 27.5  mjy , a factor @xmath21.7 the flux of the star s2 .",
    "while the high flux excursion is preceded by what looks like a flatter , background level of emission , this is however , at@xmath57  mjy , several mjy brighter than the low flux levels from most other observation nights , and indicates there was increased source activity even at this time .",
    "the long - term trend for 2009 has not been subtracted from the lightcurve shown in this plot , and the last six datapoints did not make the data quality cut for the 2004 - 2009 flux distribution . , width=302 ]    figure [ fig_dataset ] shows the 2004 - 2009 lightcurve of sgr  a * and comparison star s7 . on top of the more rapid variability , there is a general trend for the lowest fluxes of the lightcurve to wander from year to year .",
    "it is at its lowest in 2006 . in 2004",
    "the extra flux appears to be due to a combination of a faint star , a contribution from the halo of s2 , which was much closer to sgr  a * during that year , and s19 , which was confused with s17 .",
    "the lightcurve also shows some increased flux in 2008 and 2009 ; and as we will show in section [ sec_stellarcontamination ] , there is at least one additional ( previously unidentified ) faint star which must also contribute to the increased flux in those years .",
    "since we can generally identify that stars are responsible there is good justification for subtracting these long ( i.e. year ) timescale trends from the lightcurve . for want of a better method of determining the stellar contribution to the lightcurves we subtracted the difference between the median of the data from each year and the minimum median value ( in 2006 )",
    "this brings the offset in the lightcurve to roughly 3.5 - 4  mjy , much of which can be reasonably attributed to s17 ( between 2.9 and 3.3  mjy in the lightcurve can be attributed to s17 ; see section [ section_psfphot ] ) .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig_dataset ] that sgr  a * is much more variable than the comparison source s7 .",
    "some of the flux excursions are much more dramatic than others , with fluxes above 8  mjy ( @xmath55  mjy intrinsic upon subtraction of s17 ) .",
    "many of these have been previously published  for example , the second brightest peak of the dataset , in may  2006 , was published previously in @xcite and @xcite and has 16.7  mjy ( @xmath513.5  mjy intrinsic ; see table [ table2 ] in the appendix ) .    on 5th august 2008",
    ", we saw a particularly extreme event which can be seen as the most dramatic flux excursion in the lightcurve in figure [ fig_dataset ] .",
    "this event is also shown in higher time resolution in figure [ fig_superflare ] . on this particular night",
    "the source at the position of sgr  a * brightened by a factor @xmath28 in a period of @xmath540  minutes , reaching a peak flux of 30.7  mjy ( intrinsic flux of @xmath29  mjy minus s17 , a factor increase over the upper limits on the lowest fluxes from sgr  a * of @xmath227 ) .",
    "an increase in ks - band emission of this brightness is unparalleled in the literature for sgr  a * : the second brightest that has been published is a flare from october 2003 @xcite which reached an intrinsic flux of @xmath520.1  mjy ( see table [ table2 ] in the appendix ) .",
    "2 - 3  mas ; for the purposes of this plot the zero position of declination was fixed to the position for which the brightest flux from sgr  a * was recorded ( the @xmath30mjy , @xmath3  mag , event from august 5th , 2008 ) .",
    "[ fig_contaminatingstar],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    to create the 2004 - 2009 flux distribution of sgr  a * we subtracted a trend from the data that we suspected to be due to faint stars . however the trend for higher fluxes in 2008 - 2009 is not explained by the presence of any known ( previously identified ) stars .    here , however , we are able to present evidence that there was indeed one to two faint stars confused with sgr  a * in the years 2007 to 2009 . in figure [ fig_contaminatingstar ]",
    "we show that there are deviations in the source position of sgr  a * measured from imaging mosaics taken between 2007 and 2009 .",
    "the systematic deviations imply there was at least one , previously unidentified , faint star confused with sgr  a*. in fact in new , very high quality observations of early 2010 , it is possible to identify two new faint stars very close to sgr  a*. one or both of these stars may have undergone a close pericenter passage .    from figure [ fig_contaminatingstar ]",
    "it appears that one of the stars was present in 2007 also , while our offset for 2007 does not argue for any extra star .",
    "however as we discuss in section [ section_previousmeasurements ] there appears to be a relatively steady ( on the order of @xmath50.5  mjy ) stellar contribution to the flux of sgr  a * ( including the years 2006 - 2007 ) , which , together with the subtracted offsets , is probably the result of exactly such faint stars moving slowly in and out of confusion with sgr  a * : probably one of the newly discovered stars does indeed already contribute to the flux in 2007 ( with the additional increase in flux in 2009 due to the second star ) .",
    "it is somewhat a mystery why these stars have not been identified previously .",
    "the stars responsible for the observed deviations in the source position have not yet been identified in data prior to 2007 when they should have been resolved separately .",
    "perhaps they have until now always been confused with other stellar sources .",
    "the star close to sgr  a * in 2004 ( identified as s62 in * ? ? ?",
    "* though we disagree with this identification ) may be a candidate .",
    "+   +   +   +    we additionally carried out psf photometry on the ks - band data from 2009 ( 13  mas pixel scale imaging only ) using starfinder @xcite , which we use especially for investigating the question of whether sgr  a * is continuously variable at low fluxes ( section [ sec_2009 ] ) .",
    "we use an automated program for running starfinder on many images developed by @xcite .",
    "the measured fluxes were again calibrated on the s - star s65 ( @xmath31 ; @xcite ) and the results are shown in figure [ fig_2009 ] .",
    "we note that due to the presence of the two previously unidentified faint stars ( section [ sec_stellarcontamination ] ) , we improve our chances of detecting a source in most images , while at the same time the faintness of this additional stellar contribution ensures our flux measurements have very small error , such that this data set is optimum for investigating the variability of sgr  a * at low fluxes .    to produce the lightcurve we first required that a faint s - star ( s21 , of @xmath51.3  mjy ) was detected in a given image as a basic data quality cut . from these images",
    "we then examined the detected positions of sources in the near neighbourhood ( @xmath5100  mas ) of the nominal position of sgr  a * ( see figure [ fig_2009 ] ) and selected sources that were within 20  mas of the mean position of this detected source ( by this method a source was detected in 87% of the good quality selected images ) .",
    "due to this method of source selection , the dataset we present here is not completely unbiased , due to the 13% of images in which no source was detected , but the fraction in which sgr  a * was not detected is small enough that the data set still serves well to assess whether sgr  a * is in general more variable than stars of comparable flux .    from the figure ,",
    "sgr  a * certainly appears most of the time more variable than the comparison stars of similar flux ( s21 and s60 in figure [ fig_2009 ] ) .",
    "s60 , in particular provides a very good comparison since it is also close to s31 , a star of similar brightness to s17 ; the two sources s60 and s31 also have a very similar separation to sgr  a * and s17 during 2009 ( see figure [ fig_2009 ] ) .",
    "the flux distribution of s60 is fit by a gaussian with @xmath32 and @xmath33 which does not give any indication that the photometric accuracy is signficantly worse for sources of this separation and flux ratio ( the more isolated star s21 is fit by a gaussian with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "in general the starfinder and aperture photometry fluxes agree very well , with a constant offset of @xmath36  mjy . however , there is a systematic increase in the offset between the measured fluxes from the aperture photometry method and the starfinder method towards the end of 2009 , when the source(s ) confused with sgr  a * has(have ) moved the furthest to the south ( see section [ sec_stellarcontamination ] ) .",
    "this is likely explained by starfinder s one - psf fit to the distorted psf of two sources ( which has the effect of decreasing the flux measured with the starfinder method ) ; the sources are even beginning to become separated at the end of the year ( figure [ fig_2009 ] ) .",
    "this method also provides us with an estimate for the flux contribution of s17 to the 2004 - 2009 flux distribution .",
    "the offset of @xmath36  mjy is slightly fainter than the flux of s17 ( @xmath37  mjy when separated from sgr  a * in the 2009 data using starfinder ) .",
    "the lower total fluxes obtained with the aperture photometry method is probably a result of the higher stellar background surrounding sgr  a * ( i.e. in the background aperture ) compared to the more isolated flux calibration star and/or a side effect of the double aperture method .",

    "we use the following prescription for a sporadic model for the flux distribution : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the fraction of time the source spends in an ` on ' state .    using @xmath98 ( equation [ equation_p_logn ] ) and fitting to both the 2004 - 2009 aperture photometry flux distribution and to the 2009 starfinder distribution with the measured noise laws of equations [ equation_apobserror ] and [ equation_sfobserror2009 ]",

    "to do this we allow the normalization of the noise law to be a free parameter in the model fits , i.e. @xmath102 we find @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the 2004 - 2009 aperture photometric datset and the 2009 starfinder dataset respectively .",
    "we also refit the noise laws to the stars ( see equations [ equation_apobserror ] and [ equation_sfobserror2009 ] ) fixing the slope of the error law to 0.5 and obtain @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the 2004 - 2009 aperture photometric datset and the 2009 starfinder dataset respectively .",
    "the best fit noise law to the 2004 - 2009 flux distribution from aperture photometry allows @xmath107 but the normalization of the noise law is inconsistent with that of the stars at a level of 3.3@xmath95 . for the 2009 flux distribution from starfinder photometry",
    "the required noise law is even more unlikely , and is ruled out at a level of 4.5@xmath95 .",
    "we conclude that the observed behavior of sgr  a * at low fluxes is best consistent with a continuously emitting , continuously varying source .",
    "we also detect longer timescale trends in the low flux level of sgr  a * in the 2009 data ( figure [ fig_2009 ] ) , such as an @xmath50.8  mjy increase in the minimum level from the fourth to the fifth data sections , with a gap in time of only 12 days , and a similar size decrease from the second to the fourth data sections with a gap in time of only 11 days .",
    "it might be that a passing star ( such as the two new stars discovered in 2010 , see section [ sec_stellarcontamination ] ) is responsible for these trends , either passing in and out of confusion very quickly , or even just moving within the sgr  a * psf and distorting the flux : the further apart the two sources the lower the fitted flux .",
    "however these stars can not move quickly enough for this : the change in flux is so large that in either case the star must move by at least @xmath550  mas within a period of 12 days to distort the flux as much as observed , which at the 8kpc distance of the gc requires an average speed of at least 0.1@xmath108 over a two week timescale . even assuming the most extreme case  a star moving only in the plane of the sky and falling towards sgr  a * in a parabolic orbit at the escape speed  a star should take at least @xmath5110 days ( 0.02@xmath108 in average ) , to cover such a distance . a larger centroid shift between the datasets",
    "would also be expected if it were the case that a star were distorting the source psf ( @xmath520  mas instead of the observed @xmath109  mas ) .",
    "furthermore , even if this could explain the trend between the fourth and fifth datasets , the same explanation would have to be invoked to again explain the variation between the second and fourth datasets , also on a timescale of only @xmath511 days .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed trends on timescales of a few weeks in the lightcurve are most likely intrinsic .",
    "though they can not be due to direct flux contamination from passing stars , the trends are possibly still related to the feeding of the accretion flow from stellar winds of the passing stars , which may trigger increased activity as the star passes orbital pericenter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown in section [ section_results ] that the flux distribution of sgr  a * is best described by a continuously emitting , continuously variable component with a lognormal flux distribution at low fluxes , but additionally that there is a significantly flatter tail above about 5  mjy , implying that _ there is something different about the high flux emission from sgr  a*_. put together , it seems justified to identify    * emission below 5  mjy as _ quiescent state _ emission * emission above 5  mjy as _ flaring _ emission .",
    "this is the ( phenomenological ) definition by which we hereafter refer to either ` flares ' or ` quiescent ' emission in sgr  a*. we present how the two states may fit into a possible physical picture below .",
    "that the low fluxes of sgr  a * are fit by a continuously present , variable component suggests that there is truly a _ _ quiescent state _ _ in sgr  a * , i.e. a low - level , lognormally varying component ( factor @xmath52 in flux of the lognormal component corresponds to 1@xmath95 variability ) .",
    "our finding of continuously emitting , continuously variable component confirms the findings of @xcite who first reported continuous variability of sgr  a * from the larger variance of the flux of sgr  a * , as compared to stellar sources , in 5 out of 6 k-band observation nights .",
    "lognormal distributions of fluxes are seen in x - ray binaries , where they are interpreted as a sign that multiplicative processes are behind the variability ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a good example of a multiplicative process is the model of @xcite where variability is produced through the inwards propagation of accretion rate fluctuations at different radii .",
    "these variations , produced in regions of the flow which themselves do not emit near - infrared emission , all combine multiplicatively as they propagate inwards .",
    "the end result of combined fluctuations is then imprinted on the variability produced by the ( say , near - infrared ) emitting region of the flow .",
    "a very similar idea may work with magnetic turbulence , which has been shown in grmhd / mhd simulations to be capable of producing the factor 40 - 50% millimeter variability @xcite .",
    "from where exactly the quiescent emission arises is however a difficult question .",
    "nonthermal electrons are required to emit in the near - infrared , and it s not clear how these should be related to the thermal electrons emitting at submm wavelengths , or how they should necessarily be arranged within the accretion inflow / outflow .",
    "* see also @xcite ) require a hybrid thermal / non - thermal electron distribution to explain the spectrum of sgr  a * ( in particular the excess radio emission at low frequencies ) .",
    "the models predict that the same non - thermal electrons ( with @xmath51.5% of the thermal energy ) could produce emission in the near - infrared .",
    "thus it might be interesting to compare the flux distribution of the nir quiescent state emission ( @xmath110  mjy ) with that of the low - frequency radio emission , as well as correlations in timing properties , such as whether the medium - timescale trends ( @xmath52 weeks ) observed in the 2009 data ( figure [ fig_2009 ] ) correlate with any similar long - term trends in the radio regime .",
    "more detailed comparison of the low - level nir emission from sgr  a * with other wavelengths ( e.g. submm ) could also shed light on how non - thermal electrons are related to the thermal population .",
    "it seems unlikely that the same variability process is responsible for both high and low flux emission from sgr  a*. there is no obvious reason for the underlying process , if multiplicative at low fluxes , to deviate at high fluxes in order to explain the flatter tail above @xmath63  mjy .",
    "the flatter tail of the flux distribution in sgr  a * requires at the very least some transition within the source ( to a _ flaring state _ ) , triggered around an intrinsic flux of 5  mjy , such that either large fluctuations or their emission undergo some kind of runaway amplification .",
    "on the other hand the physical mechanism behind the flares could be unrelated to ( though possibly still triggered by ) the mechanism producing the low level variability .",
    "the flare tail could arise from additional sporadic _ flare events _ which dominate the distribution of fluxes above 5  mjy . in this case 5",
    "mjy is not a physically interesting flux outside the fact that it is the flux at which one is equally likely to observe either a flare event or a low level lognormal variation .",
    "spontaneous magnetic reconnection is a good candidate for a physical process that could give rise to sporadic flares in sgr  a * ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the decrease in magnetic field strength that would accompany the conversion of magnetic energy to high energy electron acceleration in a magnetic reconnection event can explain the non - one - to - one rise in the lightcurves of the so far brightest nir / x - ray flare from sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "a number of other properties also indicate that there are two types of nir emission from sgr  a * , with differences between high and low flux emission , which include :    * _ spectral index_. there are indications that the spectral index at low fluxes is redder than at higher fluxes @xcite , although this has been disputed by other authors @xcite . * _ polarization_. changes in polarization in the rising / decaying phases of flares are seen @xcite , and low level emission appears to be generally more highly polarized ( @xmath111 ) than high flux emission ( @xmath112 ) @xcite . *",
    "_ association with x - ray flares_. the best fit model ( _ lognormal+tail+errors _ ) to the 2004 - 2009 flux distribution has 4.5% of the probability above the best fit transition flux of @xmath113  mjy , which , interestingly , is close to the x - ray flaring rate of @xmath114 ( for flares occurring once a day with a duration of 60 - 100  min ; @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of the nir flaring rate including emission below 5  mjy , on the other hand , typically put the nir flaring rate much higher at @xmath115 @xcite .",

    "it is also true that millisecond - timescale flares are seen in cyg x-1 , though it was shown by @xcite that the majority of these ( and all those in the low / hard state ) were not more frequent than expected in the context of the extension of the low - level lognormal distribution in this source to higher fluxes .",

    "a connection between the near - infrared variability of sgr  a * and the variability of x - ray binaries has also been made previously from a long timescale break in the psd of sgr  a * which can be associated with a break timescale in the low - hard state of x - ray binaries ( meyer et al .",

    "our work is not the first to point out that the flux distribution of sgr  a * is not well - described by a gaussian : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have all noted that the flux distribution has a high flux tail .",
    "however , the timing analyses which have been carried out to date @xcite in which sgr  a * was compared to simulated red noise lightcurves have nevertheless used simulated lightcurves which have had , by construction , a gaussian flux distribution .",
    "sgr  a * s intrinsic mean and variance are such that if one were to plot the simulated lightcurves scaled to sgr  a * s mean and variance ( for the 2004 - 2009 dataset @xmath122  mjy subtracting 3.8  mjy for s17 plus other faint stars , and @xmath123  mjy ) , the model red noise lightcurves would have negative intrinsic fluxes much of the time which is rather unphysical .    in @xcite the high flux tail",
    "was excluded when fitting the flux distribution , and only fluxes @xmath1183.2  mjy were fitted with a gaussian ( see table [ table2 ] in the appendix for scaling factors ; the reported value in @xcite was a reddened flux of 0.3  mjy ) .",
    "thus their model lightcurves best resemble the low level emission of sgr  a*. indeed the entire dataset used by @xcite does not include much bright emission @xmath116  mjy , and thus their results really apply to the low level emission of sgr  a*. that the low level emission from sgr  a * is consistent with red noise fits together with our finding of the lognormal distribution of fluxes at low fluxes . both of these aspects of the variability are seen in x - ray binaries such as cyg x-1 @xcite .",

    "<S> the lognormal distribution has a median flux of @xmath21.1  mjy , but above 5  mjy the flux distribution is significantly flatter ( high flux events are more common ) than expected for the extrapolation of the lognormal distribution to high fluxes . </S>",
