    "pulsars are rapidly rotating and strongly magnetised neutron stars that radiate beams tied to the rotating star through their magnetic fields .",
    "frequent timing observations over months and years can give an accurate model for the spin behaviour of the neutron star .",
    "although pulsars are generally precise clocks , the timing observations have detected the two types of instability of pulsar rotation , glitches and timing noise .",
    "a glitch is characterised by abrupt increase in the rotation frequency of pulsar , usually accompanied by an increase in the spin - down rate .",
    "this event is often followed by an exponential recovery towards the extrapolation of the pre - glitch behaviour . up to now",
    ", more than 400 glitch events have been detected in at least 140 pulsars , with more than 200 having been published since 2010 . observed fractional glitch sizes range from @xmath2 to @xmath3 with a bimodal distribution , where the peaks lie around @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively @xcite .",
    "since the phenomenon was first detected in the vela pulsar @xcite , there has been a lot of effort to uncover the glitch mechanism , nevertheless , it is not fully understood .",
    "the early studies suggested that glitches result from crustquakes in the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "when the starquake model proved unviable , it was suggested that glitches are triggered by decoupling and recoupling of vortices between the crust and inner superfluid , resulting in the transfer of angular momentum to the crust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that an r - mode instability may trigger a global unpinning of vortices leading to a glitch .",
    "the vortex unpinning model can explain the various aspects of large glitches and post - glitch behaviour ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but @xcite have revived the starquake model , suggesting that material is transported from the equator to the pole , causing the star spin up , with large jumps of @xmath6 possible .    .",

    "the observations presented here show that the pulse profile exhibits strong frequency evolution . in numerous early investigations",
    ", it was found that the pulse component separation often decreases with increasing frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is usually interpreted in the context of the `` magnetic - pole '' model @xcite as `` radius - to - frequency '' mapping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the lower frequencies being emitted at greater altitudes above the magnetic pole",
    ". however , @xcite found that quite a few pulsars ( 19% of 150 normal pulsars ) showed wider profiles at high frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fg:1757width ] shows that psr j1757@xmath02421 is clearly a member of this minority group .",
    "the average pulse profile of psr j1757@xmath02421 is characterised by three components whose relative strengths vary with frequency with the leading component having a much flatter spectral index . at high frequencies",
    "the conal component , generated from the outer parts of the open field - line bundle , tends to dominate the profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such kind of profile evolution may lead to partial cones at certain frequencies or the broadening of the inner cone width at high frequency in the inverse compton scattering model @xcite .",
    "@xcite account for it as an asymmetrical spectral distribution across the flux tubes in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "this is the first detection of a glitch in the energetic pulsar psr j1757@xmath02421 since it was discovered in 1973 .",
    "this is a vela - like event with a relative amplitude of @xmath7 , identifying it as large glitch .",
    "such a large event has not been previously detected in pulsars with characteristic age @xmath8 yr .",
    "most of the large glitches are detected in pulsars with characteristic ages smaller than 10@xmath9 yr .",
    "for those radio pulsars with characteristic ages in the range 2.3@xmath10 to 3.2@xmath10 yr , similar to psr j1757@xmath02421 , only two ( psrs j1743@xmath03150 and j1825@xmath00935 ) have glitched , and these were small glitches @xcite .",
    "however , large glitches have been detected in some pulsars older than psr j1757@xmath02421 , such as j0358 + 5413 @xcite .",
    "for the glitch in psr j1757@xmath02421 , the permanent jump in the spin frequency is dominant , with @xmath11 , which is consistent with the small @xmath12 usually seen in large glitches .",
    "psr j1757@xmath02421 shows an exponential recovery following the glitch with two identifiable decay terms having time constants of approximately 15  d and 97  d respectively .",
    "including psr j1757@xmath02421 , five pulsars have shown evidence of two exponential decay terms in one event as listed in table [ 2day ] . where the shorter term ranges from 3  d to 22  d , and the longer range from 14  d to 332  d.",
    "because observational gaps are often several weeks , there could be more fast decays ( with time scales less than 20 d ) which have been missed . in this case",
    ", the magnitude of the jumps in @xmath13 and @xmath14 could be much larger .",
    "the theoretical understanding of pulsar glitches includes trigger mechanisms which seek to explain how the glitch originates and to predict glitch sizes , waiting times and their distributions , and relaxation mechanisms which explain the behavior and timescales of the post - glitch recovery . for large glitches ,",
    "a popular model is a vortex unpinning process in the superfluid components of the star @xcite .",
    "the observed post - glitch exponential recoveries have been explained as the re - establishment of an equilibrium between pinning and unpinning in a vortex - creep region interior to a neutron star @xcite .",
    "@xcite have defined a coupling parameter , @xmath15 , which equals the minimum fraction of the moment of inertia that transfers angular momentum to the crust in glitches . since @xmath16 for psr j1757@xmath02421",
    "is @xmath17  d@xmath18 , the corresponding @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite found that the effect of entrainment makes it very difficult to move superfluid neutrons relative to the crust lattice . as a result , @xcite and",
    "@xcite found that the previous calculations of @xcite underestimate by a factor of about four the moment of inertia required by observed glitches and that the superfluid reservoir in the crust of neutron stars is insufficient to produce the observed size and frequency of glitches . for psr j1757@xmath02421",
    ", it requires a reservoir comprising @xmath21 of the total moment of inertia .",
    "@xcite calculated the crustal moment of inertia of glitching pulsars by employing a series of different unified dense - matter equations of state and found values less than 20% .",
    "although the computed @xmath19 for psr j1757@xmath02421 may be an over - estimate since only one glitch has been detected , this result suggests that transfer of angular momentum from the core superfluid may be required to account for the large glitch in this relatively old pulsar .",
