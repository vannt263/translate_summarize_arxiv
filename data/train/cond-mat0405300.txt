    "recent attempts in spintronics  @xcite to harness electron spin for classical and quantum information processing have encountered two major challenges : efficient room temperature spin injection  @xcite into a semiconductor and quantum - coherent control of spin states .",
    "@xcite for example , a paradigmatic semiconductor spintronic device , the datta - das spin - field - effect transistor  @xcite where current passing through a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in semiconductor heterostructure is modulated by changing the strength of rashba so interaction via gate electrode ,  @xcite requires both problems to be surmounted .",
    "the usage of the rashba so coupling ( which arises due to inversion asymmetry of the confining electric potential for 2deg ) to control spin via electrical means has become one of the most influential concepts in semiconductor spintronics .",
    "@xcite the injected current can be modulated in this scheme only if it is fully polarized , while precessing spin has to remain quantum coherent during propagation between the two ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "although spin injection into bulk semiconductors has been demonstrated at low temperatures ,  @xcite creating and detecting spin - polarized currents in high - mobility 2deg has turned out to be a much more demanding task .",
    "in addition , the 2deg region of spin - fet would be very sensitive to the stray fields induced by the ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "@xcite    for devices pushed into the mesoscopic realm ,  @xcite it becomes possible to modulate even unpolarized currents by exploiting spin - dependent quantum interference effects in phase - coherent transport .",
    "this is due to the fact that at low temperature @xmath0 and at nanoscales full electron quantum state @xmath1 remains pure in the tensor product of orbital and spin hilbert spaces , respectively .",
    "the conductors in the shape of multiply - connected geometries have been an essential playground since the dawn of mesoscopic physics  @xcite to explore how quantum interference effects , involving topological quantum phases  @xcite acquired by a particle moving in the presence of electromagnetic potentials , leave signatures on the measurable transport properties .",
    "the typical example is a metallic ring in the magnetic field where transported electron encircling magnetic flux acquires aharonov - bohm topological phase which induced conductance oscillations .",
    "@xcite the electromagnetic duality entails an analogous effect  a neutral magnetic moment going around a charged line acquires aharonov - casher ( ac ) phase that can be manifested in a multitude of ways in mesoscopic transport quantities .",
    "@xcite    in recently proposed spintronic ring device  @xcite containing the rashba so coupling , the difference between ac phases of opposite spin states traveling clockwise and counterclockwise around the ring generates spin interference effects that can be observed in its transport properties .",
    "since the ring conductance directly depends on this difference ,  @xcite such mesoscopic quantum interference effects can be exploited to modulate conductance of unpolarized charge transport through a one - dimensional ( 1d ) ring ( attached to two 1d leads ) between 0 and @xmath2 by changing the rashba electric field via gate electrode covering the structure .",
    "@xcite the attractiveness of such _ all - electrical _ and _ all - semiconductor _ device comes from the fact that evades usage of any ferromagnetic elements or magnetic fields .",
    "however , its envisaged operation necessitates that quantum transport takes place through _ only _ a single landauer conducting channel .  @xcite the theoretical analysis thus far has been confined to strictly 1d rings ,  @xcite or 2d rings where only the lowest transverse propagating mode is open for quantum transport .",
    "@xcite in both of these cases of single - channel transport similar pattern of complete conductance modulation between 0 and @xmath2 is found , even though higher unoccupied modes in 2d rings can affect the lowest open channel .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , despite advances in nanofabrication technology , it is quite challenging to fabricate single channel quantum wires .",
    "when unpolarized current , consisting of both spin-@xmath3 and spin-@xmath4 electrons is injected through more than one propagating modes , defined by the transverse quantization in the leads of a realistic multichannel ring device , each channel will carry its own phase .",
    "moreover , during quantum transport involving more than one conducting channel , any spin - independent scattering of charge ( at interfaces or boundaries in the case of a clean system ) subjected to so coupling will lead to a loss of coherence of spin quantum state due to the possibility to entangle spin and orbital degrees of freedom ( i.e. , within the entangled state , spin subsystem can not be described by a pure state spinor ) .",
    "@xcite the multichannel nature of quantum transport in realistic rings employed in experiments is also part of the controversy surrounding recent fundamental pursuits  @xcite of the observable effect of spin berry phase . the analysis of spin - dependent features in conductance oscillations as a function of the magnetic field in disordered rings is not as transparent as in the case of strictly 1d systems .  @xcite the ac phase acquired by electrons propagating through the 1d ring , subjected to the rashba electric field orthogonal to the ring plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] ) , was shown  @xcite to consist of a dynamical rashba phase ( which depends on the cycle duration ) and the geometrical aharonov - anandan ( aa ) phase ( which depends only on the path traced in the parameter space ) characterizing any nonadiabatic cyclic evolution .",
    "@xcite in the adiabatic limit , when spin becomes aligned with the effective momentum - dependent rashba magnetic field @xmath5 in the reference frame of transported electron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] ) ,  @xcite the aa phase becomes the spin - orbit berry phase introduced in ref .  .",
    "here we address the problem of unpolarized current modulation in clean mesoscopic 2d rings with rashba so coupling by studying how the pattern of conductance oscillations changes as one opens conducting channels , one - by - one , for quantum transport .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] we discuss the issue of suitable hamiltonian description of the ring with so interactions .",
    "then we introduce a model for the multichannel ring which makes it possible to efficiently implement real@xmath6spin space green function technique in order to obtain both the spin and the charge properties of _ coupled spin - charge _ transport .",
    "@xcite section  [ sec : onech ] studies the conductance modulation in strictly 1d rings as a function of the fermi energy @xmath7 of the zero - temperature quantum transport .",
    "we also establish in this section the connection between the orientation of spin polarization vector and spin precession induced by the rashba so interaction , pointing out at spin - switch device properties of the ac rings when injected current is fully polarized . in sec .",
    "[ sec : multich ] we discuss conductance modulation in 2d rings with two and three open conducting channels .",
    "although we find that the ring conductance , in general , is not diminished to zero in the multichannel transport at any strength of the so coupling , it still displays oscillations as we tune the strength of the rashba interaction . in order to relate such `` incomplete '' conductance modulation to spin interference effects of states which are not pure ( but are instead described by the density matrices ) , we analyze in sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] transport through 2d rings within the picture of transmission eigenchannels .",
    "@xcite this makes it possible to view the multichannel transport as if occurring through a set of `` independent '' 1d rings whose channels , however , can have complicated spin coherence properties .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the absence of external magnetic field , the ballistic semiconductor ring structure subjected to the rashba so coupling is described by the following effective mass single - particle hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vector of the pauli spin operators , @xmath10 is the momentum vector in 2d space , and @xmath11 is the strength of the rashba so coupling .",
    "the last term @xmath12 represents the potential which confines electrons to a finite ring region within 2deg .",
    "the analytical expressions for the ring conductance as a function of @xmath11 have been obtained only for a strictly 1d ring geometry  in this limit one can find the eigenstates of a closed ring and then compute the transmission coefficients by opening the ring to the attached leads where electrons are injected at the fermi energy equal to the eigenenergies .",
    "@xcite however , a search for the correct 1d ring hamiltonian , which includes the rashba interaction , has turned out to be an ambiguous task yielding several apparent solutions .",
    "for example , some of the recent studies have employed non - hermitian hamiltonians .  @xcite it was pointed in ref .   that performing the limit from 2d to 1d carefully , by taking into account the radial wavefunctions in the presence of narrow confinement , leads to a unique hermitian single - particle hamiltonian in cylindrical coordinates @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the radius of the 1d ring , and @xmath15 is the angular coordinate .",

    "@xcite here we introduce the rashba so interaction into the concentric tight - binding lattice with arbitrary number @xmath26 of ring chains .",

    ".   the transmitted spins through different channels , each of which has its own orbital phase , pick up different ac phases so that conditions for a destructive interference @xmath108 can not be satisfied simultaneously in all channels , 3 .",
    "the transmitted spins lose their coherence due to coupling to environment , i.e. , the off - diagonal elements of the spin density matrix are decaying in the course of transport ;  @xcite if they do not diminish all the way to zero , the transported spin will end up in a _ partially coherent _ quantum state .",
    "@xcite + in both the first and the second scenario , the spin is described by a pure quantum state in the course of transport . although the second and the third scenario lead to the same observable consequences  the ring conductance never reaches zero since visibility  @xcite of the spin - interference effects",
    "is reduced below one  they are fundamentally different . in the second scenario ,",
    "spin states remain fully coherent , while in the third one transmitted spins are partially coherent due to coupling to the environment .",
    "even when all other ( usually many - body  @xcite ) decoherence mechanisms are suppressed , single spin of an electron can still be entangled to the environment composed of its orbital channels .",
    "this mechanism becomes operable in the clean ring when spin - independent charge scattering off boundaries and interfaces occurs in the presence of so coupling .",
    "@xcite the partially coherent states , as an outcome of entanglement of spin of transmitted electron with the spin in a quantum dot , were also found in recent experiments on aharonov - bohm ring interferometers where quantum dot is embedded in one ring arms .",
    "@xcite + here we explore possibility of the same partially coherent outgoing spin state to appear in the ac ring , where physical mechanism of entanglement is different and single - particle in nature .",
    "@xcite this makes investigation of ring transport properties in terms of    the ac phases acquired by circulating spins rather difficult since one has to extract geometric phase of an open spin quantum system described by the density matrix rather than by a pure state .  @xcite it is insightful to define the _ visibility _ of quantum interference effects in the ac ring @xmath146 here @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the maximum and the minimum values of the total conductance found in the first period of the conductance oscillations vs. @xmath105 , for a given fermi energy and corresponding number of open channels @xmath149 .",
    "the visibility @xmath150 in 2d rings allowing for a maximum of three open channels is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : visibility ] , which shows that @xmath151 in the single - channel transport regime , i.e. , the unpolarized charge transport can be fully modulated by changing the strength of the rashba so interaction ( except at particular fermi energies ) . however , as soon as the second channel starts contributing to the transport , @xmath150 decreases below one .    to investigate which of the above scenarios is realized in the transport through multichannel rings , it is advantageous to invoke as much as possible transparent picture of spin - interference effects in 1d rings .",
    "@xcite thus , to be able to consider the transport through multichannel ring as if taking place through a system of independent single - channel rings , we switch to the representation of eigenchannels .",
    "in general , the basis of eigenchannels , in which @xmath152 is a diagonal matrix , offers a simple intuitive picture of the transport in a mesoscopic conductor that can be viewed as a parallel circuit of independent channels characterized by channel - dependent transmission probabilities @xmath153 .",
    "the computation of @xmath153 as eigenvalues of @xmath152 in the case of conventional unpolarized charge transport allows one to obtain a plethora of transport quantities beyond just the conductance through simple expressions .",
    "@xcite however , the rotation to the diagonal @xmath152 matrix is inapplicable  @xcite in spintronics where usually the spin density matrix of injected electrons is non - trivial in the incoming channels of the leads . nevertheless , when both spin-@xmath3 and spin-@xmath4 are injected into the ring in equal proportion , the basis of eigenchannels allows us to `` deconstruct '' 2d ring into @xmath154 single - channel rings .",
    "moreover , in systems with so interaction , which are time - reversal invariant in the absence of external magnetic field , due to the kramers degeneracy all transmission eigenvalues are double degenerate .",
    "@xcite in the case of single - channel rings of sec .",
    "[ sec : onech ] this correspond to both spin-@xmath3 and spin-@xmath4 electrons giving identical contribution to @xmath104 .",
    "the observable transport properties of a multichannel ring can not differentiate between injection of unpolarized current through spin - polarized channels defined by the leads as a boundary condition ( which were utilized in sec .",
    "[ sec : a ] ) or through the eigenchannels .    the spin properties of eigenstates of @xmath152 can be described by assigning the density matrix to each eigenchannel @xmath155 and then taking the partial trace over the orbital degrees of freedom to get the reduced density matrix for the spin subsystem of an eigenchannel @xmath156 this allows us to extract the purity @xmath157 of the spin subsystem of an eigenchannel from @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigen_2ch ] shows the total conductance , the eigenchannel transmissions , and the spin purity @xmath85 of an eigenchannel of the two - channel @xmath159 ring conductor at two different values of the fermi energy ensuring that both conducting channels in the leads are open for transport .",
    "here we plot only the spin purity @xmath160 corresponding to the first eigenchannel ( spin purity of other eigenchannels display similar behavior ) .",
    "since the eigenchannel transmissivities are twofold degenerate , one can observer only two different values of @xmath153 at each @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen_2ch ] .",
    "when @xmath109 , the total conductance shows incomplete modulation @xmath161 since the conductance never reaches zero value .",
    "it is possible to recognize in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen_2ch ] that the eigenchannel transmissions form two distinctive curves as a function of @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , each of them exhibits full - modulation characterized by @xmath162 at particular values of @xmath105 .",
    "however , these two oscillating patterns are shifted with respect to each other , thereby preventing total conductance @xmath163 > 0 $ ] from reaching zero value at any strength of the so interaction .",
    "this can be explained as a realization of the second scenario introduced above . on the other hand , at @xmath164",
    "the total conductance shows almost complete modulation @xmath165 because : ( i ) the individual eigenchannel transmissions are akin to the ones found in single - channel rings ; and ( ii ) they almost completely overlap with each other .",
    "this case , albeit found rarely in multichannel ac rings , represents quite a good example of the first scenario mechanism .",
    "interestingly enough , @xmath166 drops below one ( meaning that an electron is `` injected '' into the conductor in an entangled state of spin and orbital channels ) at those values of @xmath105 where one would expect destructive interference effects of pure spin states in single - channel rings or system of such independent rings .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigen_3ch ] plots the same eigenchannel physical quantities for the transport through a three - channel ring @xmath97 , where @xmath109 is set to allow all three channels to be opened .",
    "the total conductance in this case also displays incomplete modulation @xmath167 . however , in this case only one @xmath168 curve can isolated that oscillates between 0 and 1 , while the other two never reach zero values .",
    "moreover , these three patterns of @xmath168 are shifted with respect to each other .",
    "this observation within the picture of three independent single channels explains why the oscillations of the total conductance end up having a rather small amplitude @xmath169 - @xmath169 .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated how the conductance of unpolarized electron transport through two - dimensional rings changes as we increase the strength of the rashba so coupling .",
    "moreover , we connect the properties of the charge transport to the orientation of spin of injected electrons as well as its coherence properties . in order to take into account the effect",
    "the finite width of the ring and the leads systematically , we model the ring using concentric tight - binding lattice hamiltonian as the starting point for the calculation of charge and spin transport properties based using the landauer transmission matrix for a two - probe device .",
    "our analysis suggests that conductance oscillations , induced by changing the rashba so coupling , will persist to some extent even in the multichannel transport through mesoscopic ring - shaped conductors .",
    "however , the oscillation patterns are rather different from the single - channel case , or from the anticipated oscillations in multichannel rings where spin - interference effects would be equivalent in all channels and simply add up .",
    "the conductance of single - channel transport through the ring displays full modulation , where @xmath121 appears quasi - periodically as a function of the rashba so coupling .",
    "this effect is explained in simple terms  @xcite as a result of destructive spin - interference effects between opposite spin states circulating in the clockwise and counterclockwise direction around the ring , where they acquire aharonov - casher phase in the presence of the rashba electric field . on the other hand , quantum transport in most of the cases occurring in multichannel rings",
    "does not lead to zero conductance at any rashba coupling . using the picture of quantum transport through independent eigenchannels ,",
    "we identify different scenarios washing out @xmath121 feature of the single - channel transport , which involve either pure or mixed transported spin states . as the number of conducting channels increases",
    ", it becomes more likely to generate partially coherent transported spin ( which is described by the density matrix rather than the pure state vector ) due to entanglement of electron spin to its orbital degrees of freedom .",
