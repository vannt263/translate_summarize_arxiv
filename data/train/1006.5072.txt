    "gravity theories in space - time dimensions greater than four have been studied extensively ever since the seminal papers of kaluza and klein on unification of gravity and gauge forces were published in the early twentieth century .",
    "modern attempts at unification of forces at the quantum level , supergravity and super string theory are formulated in eleven and ten dimensions respectively .",
    "low scale gravity models proposed by arkani hamed , dimopolous and dvali  @xcite or randall and sundrum  @xcite  @xcite to explain the hierarchy problem are also formulated in dimensions greater than four . in all these models",
    "bulk extra dimensions have to be compactified or made small by warping to explain why the observed universe has only four space - time dimensions .",
    "these extra dimensional gravity models admit black hole or black brane solutions .",
    "masses of these black objects could range from the fundamental planck scale of the theory up to astrophysical mass scales of millions of solar masses .",
    "microscopic black holes in these models would have sizes smaller than the scale of compactification while large astrophysical black objects would more likely be black strings or branes .",
    "planck scales in these models could vary from standard @xmath1 tev down to 1 tev , in low scale gravity models .",
    "in particular , low scale gravity models admit microscopic black holes of tev mass .",
    "such objects could be produced in particle accelerators like the lhc @xcite or in collisions of high energy cosmic rays with matter @xcite .",
    "most of the studies investigating black hole production at the lhc assume that the produced black holes are of the standard schwarzschild - tangherlini type and will decay almost instantaneously into elementary particles via hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "an exception is the recent work of giddings and mangano @xcite , which examines the consequences of the very conservative assumption that hawking radiation does not exist at all and conclude that tev scale black holes produced at the lhc would pose no risk to the earth over its lifetime .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the fate of the black hole relics in a model , which incorporates standard hawking radiation but in which black hole masses have a lower bound .",
    "upon approaching the mass bound the hawking temperature of these black holes goes to zero and they become stable in vacuum .",
    "their cross section for collisions with elementary particles and each other would , however , stay finite , leading to observable consequences when they come into contact with matter or collide with each other inside stars or in the galaxy .",
    "if there are stable microscopic primordial black holes then one has to confront the possibility that they could have a relic density large enough to over close the universe .",
    "for this to become a serious issue the temperature of the universe at some epoch has to be comparable to the minimum stable mass of the black holes so that they could be produced in particle collisions .",
    "for the current discussion we assume that the reheating temperature of the universe after inflation is always much less than the minimum mass of the black holes .",
    "we plan to discuss the issue of the relic density of stable lovelock black hole remnants in another publication .",
    "according to our hypothesis all primordial black holes , or black holes produced by cosmic rays , that would otherwise have decayed by the present epoch should end up in ( or very close to ) the minimal mass end state .",
    "such black holes contribute to or may even dominate dark matter .",
    "their number can only decrease in collisions with each other or by absorption by macroscopic black holes .",
    "we will discuss the passage of stable black holes through matter and point out that their interaction with matter would have a characteristic signature , detectable in underground experiments .",
    "lovelock gravity theories admit black hole solutions with a limiting minimum mass and vanishing hawking temperature .",
    "there is no reason known to us why in dimensions higher than four the contribution of lovelock terms @xcite , formed from higher powers of the curvature tensor , to the einstein action should be suppressed . now in odd dimensions the adm masses of black holes are limited below by the coupling strength of lovelock terms .",
    "furthermore , when such black holes evaporate by hawking radiation their hawking temperature approaches zero when their adm mass approaches the lower bound .",
    "the prime example of this is black holes in 5-d einstein gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "therefore , such a scenario is not completely in the realm of phantasy .",
    "since the world has 4 non - compact dimensions on macroscopic scales , we need to compactify all but four of the odd number of dimensions in which the stable minimum mass black holes live .",
    "if the size of a black hole is smaller than the compactification scale , then the caged black hole should still have a stable minimum mass .",
    "a systematic expansion in the inverse of the compactification scale for black holes in einstein gravity has been studied in the past @xcite @xcite .",
    "lovelock black holes can be embedded into a higher dimensional space , turning the black holes into black branes in those extra dimensions .",
    "while we return to the discussion of these questions in the last section of this paper we will study these and similar problems more extensively in a future publication .",
    "a simpler alternative , of trying to compactify all dimensions beyond 4 at the same scale in gauss - bonnet gravity has recently been attempted @xcite . though a minimal mass exists in such a scenario , but the hawking temperature does not vanish and consequently black branes are not stable at the minimal mass .",
    "the consequences of gauss - bonnet gravity on black hole phenomenology have already been considered by rizzo  @xcite  @xcite concentrating on the signature of tev - scale stable black holes produced at lhc , and by alexeyev , barrau , boudoul , khovanskaya , and sahzin @xcite in the framework of an add @xcite or randall - sundrum ii @xcite model with limiting masses of macroscopic range ( 1 @xmath2- @xmath3 .",
    "we would like to concentrate on models in which the minimal mass of black holes is comparable or below the 4 dimensional planck mass . such a mass limit would be natural for example in the framework of a randall - sundrum @xcite scenario , add theory in 9 or 11 dimensions , or kaluza - klein models in 11 dimensions and some string - inspired models of compactification .    though schwarzschild - lovelock black holes in odd dimensions are at the back of our minds , our investigations are fairly independent of specific models .",
    "they require the knowledge of a few basic parameters , namely the coupling strength of the lovelock terms , to describe the near - minimal mass behavior of these solutions .",
    "we assume that all non - topological lovelock terms are present in the lagrangian and all of their couplings are in the scale of the planck mass .",
    "it is worth mentioning that higher order corrections to heterotic string theories contribute a gauss - bonnet term ( second order lovelock term ) to the classical action @xcite , @xcite .    when all the lovelock coefficients are of @xmath4 , black holes or black branes with @xmath5 are well described by the schwarzschild - tangherlini metric , their behavior is quite standard and well described by einstein gravity . in this paper we will concentrate on black holes with masses close to the minimum mass of the order of @xmath6 , when lovelock terms play an important role leading to significant phenomenological consequences .",
    "in the current paper we have not addressed questions pertaining to detection of stable microscopic black hole remnants by direct dark matter detection experiments @xcite , @xcite . on one hand , if the minimum mass of these black holes is close to 1 tev , then we will show that their abundance must be extremely low compared to other components of dark matter to avoid a contradiction with proton decay experiments .",
    "on the other hand , if their mass is much higher it could be difficult to detect them in direct dark matter detection experiments .    finally , to close this section we list the issues we intend to address in the rest of this paper .",
    "( i ) stable minimal mass black holes aggregate in clumps under the influence of gravity .",
    "then they will form part ( or all ) of dark matter .",
    "this effect was considered for macroscopic stable black holes by alexeyev et .",
    "@xcite , and for even larger , astronomical size black holes by frampton @xcite , as well .",
    "these black holes may accumulate inside stars depending on the parton cross section , their velocity distribution , and the gravity at the surface of the star .",
    "we will discuss the rate of heat production by the collision of accumulated black holes and compare it to that of `` standard '' wimps @xcite .",
    "( ii ) black holes , as part of dark matter , would collide with partons while passing through detectors in underground laboratories .",
    "these collisions would be followed by a characteristic decay that is quite different from those of schwarzschild black holes . using past proton decay experiments we are able to give a rough lower bound on the minimum mass of stable black holes and/or their abundance compared to other dark matter constitutents .",
    "we also propose an experimental investigation of finding stable black holes in underground laboratories .",
    "( iii ) relativistic black holes produced by cosmic rays @xcite passing through stars or planets may evaporate to minimal size or increase in size by accretion depending on the interaction cross section .",
    "we estimate what is the lowest energy of incoming cosmic rays that allows black holes to increase in size and accrete all available matter in a star .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction our investigations are largely independent of the choice of a specific gravity model .",
    "we only assume that black holes have a minimal mass , at which the hawking temperature vanishes .",
    "lovelock black holes @xcite in odd dimensions are prime examples satisfying these constraints .",
    "gravitational theories including lovelock terms are perfectly acceptable , as their field equations contain only second order derivatives and satisfy standard requirements on a classical theory of gravity just as much as einstein gravity does .",
    "the langrangian of the @xmath7th order lovelock term , @xmath8 , is built from an antisymmetrized combination of the @xmath7th power of the curvature tensor . in @xmath9 dimensions a linear combination of lovelock terms up to @xmath10 , such as @xmath11",
    "contribute non - trivially to the equations of motion .",
    "note that @xmath12 corresponds to the cosmological constant , the @xmath13 term is einstein gravity , and gauss - bonnet gravity corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "we extract an appropriate power of the planck mass to make the coupling constants @xmath15 dimensionless . also note that we use @xmath6 as a unknown quantity , dependent on @xmath9 , to be determined by experiments .",
    "we also keep the coupling constants , @xmath15 as free parameters , but when we need to make an estimate of an observable quantity we will often consider predictions under the assumption @xmath16 , or , alternatively @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the minimal mass .",
    "we use a definition of newton s constant in terms of the planck mass of the `` particle data book '' @xcite , @xmath19 with this definition the experimental lower bound on @xmath6 is @xmath20 tev @xcite .",
    "this bound was calculated assuming schwarzschild - tangherlini black holes .",
    "we expect that the lower bound on the planck mass when black holes have a minimal mass is somewhat lower .",
    "the reason for that is the small amount of radiation produced when the black holes approach the minimal mass .",
    "since it barely radiates one could only recognize its production by the missing energy that could have been taken away by other neutral particles .",
    "analytic spherically symmetric black hole solutions have been found for @xmath14 @xcite@xcite@xcite and 3 @xcite lovelock gravity .",
    "while in even dimensions black hole masses have no lower bound , in odd dimensions the mass is limited by the lovelock coupling @xmath15 , to ensure the existence of a horizon .",
    "in particular for @xmath21 and 7 @xmath22 in ( [ bounds ] ) @xmath23 is the radius of horizon for the @xmath9-dimensional tangherlini black hole @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26}.\\ ] ] using the latter equations the lower bounds on the adm mass are @xmath27 for @xmath21 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the minimal mass is larger than the planck mass if the coupling of the lovelock terms , @xmath16 .",
    "this result may be of significance if we consider the stability of minimum masses under quantum gravity .",
    "it is possible that quantum effects destabilize classically stable black holes . in what follows , we assume that even if that were true , their lifetimes are long enough to leave our classical calculations valid .",
    "the radius of horizon is @xmath29 in 5 and 7 dimensions , respectively .",
    "the hawking temperature in 5 dimensions is @xmath30 in @xmath9=7 the expression for @xmath31 is much more complicated , but also proportional to the radius of horizon , as in @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for this is simple . in odd dimensions the metric functions are even functions of the radius and",
    "the surface gravity is proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "then both of these theories the radius of horizon and the hawing temperature vanish as @xmath33 .",
    "this is a general feature of theories we consider in this paper .    strictly speaking minimum mass black holes",
    "do not exist .",
    "scalars , like the curvature scalar , square of the ricci tensor , and the kretschmann scalar all diverge at zero radial coordinate , when the radius of the horizon vanishes .",
    "this state is , however , never reached in the semi - classical theory because , as is shown by ( [ timedependence ] ) , it takes infinite time for the mass of a black hole produced with @xmath34 to reach @xmath18 .",
    "while at sufficiently large mass , @xmath35 , the hawking temperature approaches its value in einstein gravity @xmath36 , at @xmath37 in lovelock gravity it can be parametrized by the constants , @xmath6 and @xmath15 as @xmath38 in general we may parametrize the dependence of the hawking temperature on the minimal mass by the two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath6 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "we will use this formula in all subsequent calculations .",
    "however , whenever we need concrete numbers for calculating a particular phenomenon related to stable black holes we will rely on the 5 dimensional formulas , which , hopefully , give a good order of magnitude estimate in higher dimensional spaces , as well .",
    "if black holes become stable after approaching a nonzero minimal mass then their number can only be reduced by collisions with each other , when the mass of one of the black holes is converted into radiation .",
    "therefore , most primordial black holes and those produced later by cosmic rays should still be around at the present time . for large black holes the higher dimensional lovelock terms become irrelevant and",
    "the schwarzschild approximation is valid .",
    "thus , the spectrum of black holes produced after inflation is unaffected by them .",
    "hawking and page @xcite have shown that primordial black holes lighter than @xmath42 g would have decayed by now . however , in odd dimensional lovelock theory they would have all ended up in the near - minimal mass state .",
    "these black holes , along with small black holes produced later , would form part of dark matter . in the current section",
    "we investigate the effect of such a component of dark matter and derive bounds on their minimal mass , @xmath18 , and their relative abundance compared to other components of dark matter .",
    "first we show that for a very wide range of the planck mass , @xmath6 , and of minimal mass , @xmath18 , the passage of non - relativistic black holes through matter follows a simple pattern : a minimal mass black hole accretes a parton or an electron increasing the mass and the hawking temperature of the black hole .",
    "the accretion is followed by the rapid decay of the black hole towards the minimal mass state , very probably before the next accretion takes place .",
    "this sequence of events allows us to derive a recursion relation for the velocity distribution and an integral equation for the limiting distribution .",
    "not surprisingly , in view of the central limit theorem , the solution of the integral equation is a maxwell distribution .",
    "it is interesting that the average velocity in the limiting distribution , depending on @xmath43 can be higher than average velocity of incoming dark matter particles . using the velocity distribution",
    "we show that in neutron stars the near - stable black holes are confined to a sphere of radius @xmath44 m where they reach an equilibrium density in a few decades after the formation of the neutron star . in equilibrium , the number of black holes annihilated in pairwise collisions is equal to the number of black holes captured by the neutron star from dark matter .",
    "we will also show that black holes can not be captured by ordinary stars , if @xmath45(1 tev ) , as the velocity of most of black holes exceeds the escape velocity .",
    "however , if @xmath46 tev , then their velocity is smaller and the captured black holes accumulate inside the sun , as well .    at the end of this section",
    "we will investigate the experimental signature of stable black holes passing through experimental devices .",
    "the signature is quite universal .",
    "it is in large measure independent of the minimal mass , up to @xmath47 tev , and of the velocity of the black holes .",
    "when we calculate the decay of black holes we can use the schwarzschild metric for black holes with @xmath48 , while ( [ hawking2 ] ) can be applied to black holes with @xmath49 . considering that standard model particles live on a 3 brane the radiation happens mainly on the brane @xcite . then the decay rate of near minimal black holes in vacuum is @xmath50 where @xmath2 is the number of effective degrees of freedom . in 7 dimensions",
    "an extra factor of 2/9 should be included on the right hand side of ( [ decayrate ] ) .",
    "note that , unlike for schwarzschild black holes , in a theory with stable black holes the contribution of emission into the bulk is negligible when @xmath51 is close to @xmath52 .",
    "the contribution of bulk radiation to ( [ decayrate ] ) would have higher powers of @xmath53 and @xmath31 , both vanishing when @xmath54 .",
    "integrating ( [ decayrate ] ) gives @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the energy gained by the absorption of a parton .",
    "the half - time ( time required to reach @xmath57 is @xmath58 when non - relativistic black holes travel through matter they absorb partons from atomic nuclei .",
    "since they can not leave colored matter behind , they must pull out an antiparton from the chromosphere of the black hole , as well .",
    "altogether , they only gain about a mass of @xmath59gev ) .",
    "note that @xmath60 is , in a very good approximation , independent of @xmath18 .",
    "when , following the accretion process , owing to the limited available total mass , @xmath60 , they can only emit light degrees of freedom , mostly photons , electrons , positrons , neutrinos and antineutrinos , with an occasional muon or pion .",
    "then the effective number of degrees of freedom , including greybody factors @xcite is @xmath61 .",
    "note that for 7 dimensional black holes the prefactor in ( [ halftime ] ) should be decreased to 0.03 .    applied to 5 dimensional black holes we obtain the following expression for @xmath62 @xmath63 note that here and all in subsequent equations @xmath6 and @xmath18 are measured in units of tev and are therefore dimensionless .",
    "as we will see below , the decay time ( [ fivelifetime ] ) is much shorter than the average time between collisions .",
    "then it follows that the passage through ordinary matter is a series of accretions of partons each followed by almost instantaneous decay back to near minimal mass .      for the sake of definiteness we will consider black holes in a rs i scenario . a classical calculation of the bondi - hoyle - littleton accretion",
    "can be performed by considering the geodesics of pointlike incoming particles at impact parameter @xmath64 .",
    "if the impact parameter is smaller than the compactification radius then the absorbtion cross section is defined by the maximal @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the maximal impact parameter at which the projectile is captured by the black hole . for this calculation",
    "we must use the @xmath9 dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet metric in the neighborhood of the black hole .",
    "we obtain for @xmath21 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the relative velocity and @xmath69 is the corresponding lorentz factor .",
    "since we are interested in order of magnitude estimates we use classical cross sections throughout this paper .",
    "the increase of @xmath70 with decreasing @xmath68 is due to the increase of the maximal impact parameter at which the particle is captured .",
    "however , at large impact parameters the 5 dimensional metric is no longer applicable , because at large distances from the black hole the metric becomes effectively 4 dimensional , with standard 4 dimensional gravitation strength , which hardly causes any deflection of particles .",
    "the transition between the 5 and 4 dimensional behaviors happens at @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the radion mass .",
    "the largest lower bound on the radion mass , 120 gev , has been derived in @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of upper bounds .    to incorporate the low velocity cutoff imposed by the radion mass we modified our calculation of the cross section by using the simple minded assumption that the metric reduces to minkowski metric at distances larger than @xmath73 .",
    "then at @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath76    for larger black holes the cross section can be calculated from the schwarzschild metric .",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is given in ( [ mass ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath21 @xmath79      the mean free path in a medium is given by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the number density and @xmath70 is the collision cross section . to get a rough estimate of the mean free path",
    "we will use the absorption cross section .",
    "we will discuss neutron stars first .",
    "nuclear matter has the parton number density , with about 3 partons per neutron @xmath82    then using ( [ cross ] ) and ( [ sigrad ] ) , we obtain @xmath83 where the upper limit is given by the minimum of ( [ cross ] ) , at @xmath84 and the lower limit by ( [ sigrad ] ) at the minimum radion mass @xcite @xmath85120 gev . however , if @xmath86 tev , then the velocity dependent classical formula gives a larger lower bound then the one obtained using the minimum radion mass ( @xmath87 will be calculated in the next subsection ) : @xmath88 the lower bound ( [ nuclear2 ] ) ensures that black holes undergo many collisions in nuclear matter ( or in stars ) , except in the case when our mass parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath18 are at the upper end of the range of interest , near @xmath89 .",
    "then the mean free path becomes larger than a few km and most black holes undergo a small number of collisions only .",
    "since the number of collisions inside the star largely depend on the total mass only , a similar statement applies to a star , like our sun , as well .",
    "the corresponding bounds on the mean free path in water are @xmath90 where the first lower bound is obtained using cross section ( [ sigrad ] ) , while the second using ( [ cross ] ) at low @xmath68 .",
    "these numbers will be important when we will discuss experimental constraints on @xmath18 and @xmath91 , the fraction of dark matter in the form of microscopic stable black holes .",
    "while passing through earth black holes undergo a large number of collisions , unless @xmath92 is very large . the limits for water , ( [ water ] ) ,",
    "should be divided by 5.5 . even though they collide with nuclei many times inside the earth ,",
    "the earth can not capture black holes , because , as we show in the next subsection , their average velocity , @xmath93 is orders of magnitude higher than the escape velocity .",
    "let us compare now the decay time of black holes with the collision time in nuclear matter .",
    "the average time between collisions is @xmath94 . in the next subsection",
    "we will determine the average speed of black holes , dependent only on having a large number of collisions and largely independent of the matter density .",
    "we will obtain @xmath95 . using ( [ nuclear ] ) and taking the accreted energy @xmath96 gev in each collision , we obtain the following expression for the ratio of collision time and decay time in nuclear matter @xmath97 taking the root of the product of the two lower limit , setting @xmath98 , and using the very conservative value @xmath99 we obtain a lower limit that is independent of @xmath6 , namely @xmath100 even in the center of the neutron star where the density is 2 - 3 times higher than that of nuclear matter the ratio is much larger than 1 .",
    "the important message in ( [ ratio ] ) is that the passage of black holes through any medium , including the core of neutron stars , follows a simple pattern . after a @xmath37 black hole collides with and absorbs a parton its excess mass evaporates long before the next collision to become a @xmath37 black hole again .",
    "this sequence will be important in the next subsection in which we investigate the velocity distribution of non - relativistic black holes close to their minimum mass in matter .",
    "we consider stable black holes arriving , as part of the dark matter , at a star or a planet , in which they undergo multiple collisions .",
    "for simplicity , we will consider the star as infinite matter .",
    "if the temperature of the star is low compared to the kinetic energy of incoming stable black holes one may naively think that the black holes lose velocity , until their kinetic energy reaches the ambient temperature .",
    "in fact , this is not the case at all because the inelastic collision and subsequent decay of the black holes may result in , depending on the mass of the black hole , an increase of the average velocity .",
    "the black holes are not in equilibrium with the surrounding matter , because of the long collision time compared to the decay time , as shown by ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "when the black hole accretes a parton then , as an average , it slows down slightly in the star rest system .",
    "however , after accretion it decays soon approaching its minimal mass state by emitting a small number of particles and gaining extra velocity from the recoil .",
    "after multiple collisions the addition of these recoil velocities results in a random velocity distribution , which is independent of the original velocity distribution of incoming dark matter particles .",
    "the average velocity depends on @xmath18 but as we will see below if @xmath101 tev then it is higher than the average velocity of dark matter particles .",
    "let us consider the first step of the repeating two - step process , the accretion .",
    "as black holes accrete partons of energy @xmath60 then , as an average , their momentum is conserved in the star frame but they lose approximately the fraction @xmath102 of their velocity . however , in the second step , when they subsequently radiate essentially all of the accreted @xmath60 energy they also gain momentum @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the momenta of emitted particles .",
    "the @xmath7 particles are emitted isotropically .",
    "since the hawking temperature @xmath105 the individual particle momentum distribution can be approximated by phase space . neglecting the mass of emitted particles the momentum gained by the black hole after the end of hawking radiation is @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is a normalization constant .",
    "note that @xmath7 , the number of particles emitted , is small , @xmath109 , as it can be ascertained using the infinite temperature limit of the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distributions . in particular , @xmath110    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111/36 $ ] .",
    "the distribution @xmath112 is slightly more complicated , containing polylogarithms .    now",
    "the question is whether after successive accretions and subsequent hawking radiations the momentum distribution approaches a limiting distribution or not .",
    "originally the speed of the black hole is about @xmath113 , a typical speed for dark matter particle .",
    "the change of the speed of the black hole due to the emission of particles is @xmath114 .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as the original velocity , at least if the mass of the black hole is @xmath1151tev ) . even if the black hole has mass @xmath116tev it loses memory of the original direction , as it undergoes a very large number of collisions",
    "thus , its distribution becomes isotropic ( discounting the effect of the gravitational force of the star ) .",
    "after a few collisions the speed distribution of the black hole in homogeneous infinite matter approaches an asymptotic form determined by the integral equation @xmath117-\\vec q / m_{\\rm min}\\right)f(q)d^3q    \\label{recursion}\\ ] ] where the multiplier @xmath118 is the factor by which an accretion slows down the black hole and @xmath119 is the normalized weighted average of distributions @xmath120 over @xmath121 .    as expected from the central limit theorem , the solution of ( [ recursion ] ) , in leading order of @xmath102 , is a gaussian distribution , @xmath122 where @xmath123 with @xmath124 . for massless particles the value of @xmath125 ( @xmath126 for @xmath7 decay products ) is @xmath127 .",
    "the expectation value of the squared velocity is @xmath128 one would expect that the number emitted particles is small , so @xmath129 , leading , for @xmath130 1 tev , to an average velocity , @xmath131 . in other words , the multiple collision process _ accelerates _ the minimal mass black hole .",
    "provided @xmath132 tev .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) is a maxwell distribution with @xmath133 mev .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the temperature of the gas of black holes is independent of the temperature of the medium .",
    "the two different temperatures are maintained by the peculiar nature of the interaction of black holes with particles in the medium .",
    "the calculation of the average velocity in the previous section has assumed that no external forces act on the black hole .",
    "this is not true in stars and particularly in a neutron star in which the gravitational field is enormous . using a radius of @xmath13410 km , and mass of @xmath135",
    "we obtain the gravitational potntial , @xmath2 , as @xmath136    the velocity of black holes is then much smaller than the escape velocity and the black holes start to move towards the center of the neutron star . at the center , however , the gravitational field vanishes , so the black holes rapidly reach the velocity distribution described in the previous subsection .",

    "if minimum mass black holes constitute a fraction @xmath91 of dark matter , then using the dark matter density of 300 gev @xmath142 , a radius of 10 km , and a mass of 1.5 times that of the sun we obtain the following capture rate of black holes traveling at @xmath143 km / s @xmath144    the number of black holes undergoing two - body collisions in the central sphere per unit time and unit volume is @xmath145 then using the maxwell distribution ( [ distribution ] ) the average relative velocity of two black holes is @xmath146 now after attaining equilibrium @xmath147 so the density of black holes in the central sphere is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the volume of the central sphere confining the black holes .",
    "the cross section is measured in m@xmath150 .",
    "now we can use our three bounds on @xmath70 to find bounds on the density of black holes in the central region of a neutron star . using ( [ cross ] ) in the extreme relativistic limit we obtain an upper limit , while using ( [ cross ] ) with @xmath151 taken from ( [ averagevelocity ] ) provides one of the lower bounds , and finally ( [ sigrad ] ) provides another lower bound , as follows @xmath152 these limits can be compared with the density of partons in the central region , @xmath153 .",
    "how long a time is needed to fill a newly created neutron star with black holes at equilibrium density ?",
    "the total number of black holes in the central region divided by the rate of black hole capture provides two lower bounds on @xmath154 , obtained from ( [ lower1 ] ) @xmath155 it is worth noting that if @xmath6 and @xmath18 are close to @xmath156 tev then the process of `` filling '' the neutron star with black holes , which , according to ( [ centralradius ] ) , are now concentrated at the very center of the neutron star , takes tens of millions of years .",
    "this would imply a change in the surface temperature on the scale of tens of millions of years , as well .",
    "an investigation of time dependence of the surface temperature and its possible observation in neutron stars has been performed assuming that wimps constitute dark matter @xcite .",
    "black holes as components of dark matter , could effect the surface temperature of neutron stars considerably less than wimps .",
    "the mass of the black hole produced from the collision of two black holes may be substantially less than the sum of the masses of the colliding black holes @xcite .",
    "the lowest possible resultant mass is obtained from adding entropies , rather than masses . in the case of near minimal mass stable black holes that would imply a third black hole of near minimal mass , as well . the rest of the energy , @xmath157 ,",

    "we will consider ordinary stars briefly . in a star like our sun , or in any star , for that matter",
    ", black holes undergo a large number of collisions to reach the equilibrium velocity distribution ( [ distribution ] ) . owing to the large size of the sun or other ordinary stars ,",
    "the surface gravity is smaller then the average squared velocity , provided the minimum mass is smaller than @xmath158 tev , @xmath159 however , if @xmath160 then black holes get captured in the sun , as well . in fact , the number of black holes collected in a central sphere is much larger than those in a neutron star , owing to the sun s much larger cross section to capture dark matter .",
    "we intend to address this question along with the question of dissipation of heat produced from the annihilation of black holes from stars @xcite in a future publication .      as we pointed out in the previous subsection , stable black holes contributing to dark matter travel through visible matter in an unusual manner .",
    "suppose at a given instant the black hole is close to its minimal mass with nearly zero hawking temperature . then colliding with an atomic nucleus , or an electron it can absorb a parton or an electron and increase its mass and hawking temperature .",
    "note that stable black holes near the minimum mass have positive specific heats .",
    "the mass of the black hole increases by the energy of the accreted object , @xmath161 , while , as shown by ( [ hawking2 ] ) , its temperature increases to @xmath162 .",
    "this implies that the increase in temperature is larger by at least two orders of magnitude than the increase of energy .",
    "the black hole becomes a very hot object with very low heat capacity .",
    "it is difficult to calculate the average particle number and momentum distribution in this strange system .",
    "however , owing to the fact that the total energy to be radiated isotropically is in the range of @xmath163 gev the decay products are restricted to light particles , mostly photons and electrons and neutrinos , with a possible muon or pion .",
    "a certain amount of gravitons are also emitted , further decreasing the missing energy @xcite .",
    "due to phase space considerations lower multiplicity is probably preferred , so most of the events should contain 1 - 3 visible particles . as the recoiling black hole takes up momentum ,",
    "the total momentum is not balanced even if we disregard the momentum taken away by gravitons and neutrinos . in many ways",
    "the events should be similar to the decay of a proton - like object with a mass of less than a gev .",
    "therefore , the ideal experiment searching for stable black holes is in large underground detectors .    as in proton decay experiments ,",
    "the most important background signal is the inelastic interactions of atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "as stable black hole emission events also resemble proton decay events , we may use the frequency of those neutrino events as an upper bound on black hole evaporation events .",
    "this amounts to an upper bound on the event rate of @xmath167 m@xmath168s@xmath169 .",

    "if black holes become stable upon reaching their minimal mass then their number density can be reduced only by collisions of black holes .",
    "then by necessity , near minimum mass black holes form a part of dark matter .",
    "one major concern of this paper has been to find upper limits on the contribution of stable microscopic ( of mass between 1 tev and the four dimensional planck mass ) black holes to dark matter .",
    "we have provided an approximate upper bound on their abundance using existing data at underground experiments .",
    "in fact , we also show that using the extreme assumption that all of dark matter is constituted from stable microscopic black holes their mass is at least @xmath238 tev , but probably more than @xmath239 tev . in doing so",
    "we show that stable black holes traversing through underground chambers have a very peculiar characteristic signals , especially if their minimum mass is larger then @xmath240 tev . in the range @xmath241",
    "tev their decay is local , often imitating a low energy ( @xmath242 gev ) neutrino interaction .",
    "however , at higher energies , especially at @xmath178 tev , after a localized partial evaporation they continue emitting lower and lower energy particles ( mostly photons and possibly electrons ) along a track as they progress through the detector . unfortunately",
    ", if @xmath243 tev then the event rate at the super - kamiokande detector becomes so low that the observation the black hole evaporation process becomes very difficult .",
    "black holes that form part of dark matter accumulate in a central region of neutron stars .",
    "there they annihilate by colliding with each other .",
    "eventually they reach equilibrium with the incoming flux and then they produce heat though possibly at a lower rate than other components of dark matter @xcite . in ordinary stars , however the surface gravity is not sufficient to keep the black holes from escaping unless the @xmath244100 tev , in which case the average velocity of black holes becomes smaller than the escape velocity .",
    "however , if the @xmath245 tev the mean free path in black holes and in ordinary stars becomes comparable with the size of the star and most of the black holes are not captured .    among other aspects of the physics of black holes we investigated the accretion of relativistic ( cosmic ray ) black holes in matter .",
    "we find that all black holes created by cosmic ray protons below the greisen - kuzmin - zatsepin limit @xcite slow down and lose mass in stars , among others , in neutron stars .",
    "finally , we return to a problem , which we already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "two further steps are required to complete our scenario , either of which could potentially destabilize minimum mass black holes .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 is the ( odd ) number of dimensions of lovelock gravity , which we have considered in this paper . since there are only 4 non - compact dimensions in our world we still need to compactify @xmath246 dimensions .",
    "the second problem concerns the existence of dimensions beyond @xmath9 .",

    "@xmath248 may be even or odd .",
    "we must embed black holes into the @xmath248 dimensional space . in the next paragraph",
    "we will sketch a possible solution to these problems .",
    "suppose the compactification scales of @xmath249 and @xmath246 dimensions are @xmath250 and @xmath179 , where @xmath251 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is odd and all lovelock terms up to @xmath10 order appear in the action .",
    "the minimum mass should be small enough , such that black holes close to the minimum mass are caged in the @xmath246 compact dimensions , but at the same time it should be large enough so that black holes are extended as black branes into the extra @xmath249 dimensions .",
    "in other words , the condition for the existence of a stable minimum mass is that @xmath23 defined in ( [ mass ] ) is in between the two scales , i.e @xmath252 , where @xmath253 and @xmath254 are @xmath4 dimensionless constants .",

    "<S> we investigate some of the experimental , observational and theoretical consequences of hypothetical stable black holes in the mass range between the electro - weak scale and the planck mass , 2.4@xmath0 tev . for the purpose of calculations we use lovelock black holes in odd dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> if such black holes exist they contribute to dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the passage of the black holes through matter and the collision of black holes have a well defined experimental signature . depending on their cross section and energy </S>",
