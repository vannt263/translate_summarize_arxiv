    "let @xmath17 be ii@xmath1 factors with @xmath3<\\infty$ ] . there is a `` standard invariant '' for @xmath17 which we shall describe using the planar algebra formalism of @xcite .",
    "the vector spaces @xmath18 of @xmath19 invariant vectors in the @xmath19 bimodule @xmath20 admit an action of the operad of planar tangles as in @xcite and @xcite . in more usual notation",
    "the vector space @xmath18 is the relative commutant @xmath21 in the tower @xmath22 of @xcite .",
    "the conditional expectation @xmath23 from @xmath14 to @xmath12 is in @xmath24 and generates a sub - planar algebra called the temperley - lieb algebra . in @xcite , bisch and",
    "the second author studied the planar subalgebra of the @xmath18 generated by the conditional expectation onto a single intermediate subfactor @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting planar algebra is called the fuss - catalan algebra and was generalised by bisch and the second author to a chain of intermediate subfactors -see also @xcite",
    ". these planar algebras are universal in that they are always planar subalgebras of the standard invariant for any subfactor possessing a chain of intermediate subfactors",
    ". if @xmath26 is the chain , there are no restricitions on the individual inclusions of @xmath27 in @xmath28 .",
    "moreover the existence of the fuss catalan planar algebra together with a theorem of popa in @xcite allows one to construct a `` free '' increasing chain where the individual inclusions @xmath26 have `` no extra structure '' , i.e. their own standard invariants are just the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "thus the standard invariants for the @xmath26 are `` decoupled '' from the algebraic symmetries coming from the existence of a chain of intermediate subfactors .    in @xcite ,",
    "sano and watatani considered the angle between two subfactors @xmath6 and @xmath7 which we shall here define via the square of its cosine , namely the spectrum of the positive self - adjoint operator @xmath29 ( on @xmath30 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "feng xu and the second author proved that finiteness of the angle ( as a substet of @xmath31 $ ] ) is equivalent to finiteness of the index of @xmath32 in @xmath14 . if we suppose that @xmath32 is an irreducible finite index subfactor of @xmath14 we might expect that the angle is `` quantized '' , i.e. only a certain discrete countable family of numbers occurs - at least in a range close to @xmath33 and @xmath34 . determining these allowed angle values is becoming a significant question in the abstract theory of subfactors .",
    "this paper can be considered a first step in answering that question .    in @xcite ,",
    "watatani considered the lattice of intermediate subfactors for a finite index inclusion and showed that if the inclusion is irreducible the lattice is finite .",
    "he gave some constructions which allowed him to realise many simple finite lattices , but even for two lattices with only six elements , the question of their realisation as intermediate subfactor lattices remains entirely open .",
    "the present paper grew out of an attempt by dietmar bisch and the second author to extend the methods of @xcite to attack both the angle quantization and the intermediate lattice problems .",
    "the hope was to construct universal planar algebras depending only on the lattice of intermediate subfactors , and possibly the angles between them , and use popa s theorem to construct subfactors realising the lattice and angle values .",
    "this project is probably sound but it is hugely more difficult in the case where the lattice is not a chain or the angles are not all @xmath33 or @xmath35 .",
    "the reason is very simple - the planar algebra generated by the conditional expectations can no longer be decoupled from the standard invariants of the elementary subfactor inclusions in the lattice .",
    "this is surprisingly easy to see .",
    "the spectral subspaces of @xmath29 are @xmath19-bimodules contained in @xmath8 so that as soon as the angle operator has a significant spectrum the subfactor @xmath17 must have elements in its planar algebra that are not in the temperley - lieb subalgebra - a situation we shall refer to as having `` extra structure '' and which we will quantify using the notion of supertransitivity introduced in @xcite",
    ". in particular if there is no extra structure the spectrum of @xmath29 can consist of at most one number besides @xmath33 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will call the angle whose cosine is the square root of this number `` angle between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . or ' ' dually \" if @xmath37 is not equal to all of @xmath14 , it is a non - trivial @xmath38 bimodule between @xmath8 and @xmath14 so that the inclusion @xmath6 must have extra structure .",
    "thus we are led to the question - what are the possible pairs of subfactors @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath14 with @xmath32 a finite index irreducible subfactor of @xmath14 , for which the four elementary subfactors @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 all have no extra structure ? more properly , since we are not trying to control the isomorphism type of the individual factors , one should ask what are the standard invariants that arise . one situation is rather easy to take care of :",
    "if the subfactors form a commuting cocommuting square in the sense of @xcite , there is no obstruction - it was essentially observed by sano and watatani that in this case @xmath39 and @xmath40 generate a tensor product of their individual temperley - lieb algebras . and",
    "to realise any @xmath4 and @xmath5 just take the tensor product ii@xmath1 factors",
    ". however if we assume that the subfactors either do not commute or do not cocommute , we will show in this paper the following unexpected result .",
    "suppose @xmath41 is a quadrilateral of subfactors with @xmath42 , @xmath3<\\infty$ ] and no extra structure",
    ". then either the quadrilateral is commuting or one of the following two cases occurs :    \\a ) @xmath3=6 $ ] and @xmath12 is the fixed point algebra for an outer action of @xmath13 on @xmath14 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the fixed point algebras for two transpositions in @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is @xmath15 and the full intermediate subfactor lattice is .",
    "( note that the dual of this quadrilateral is a commuting square . )",
    "\\b ) the subfactor @xmath12 is of depth @xmath43 , @xmath3=(2+\\sqrt 2)^2 $ ] and the planar algebra of @xmath17 is the same as that coming from the ghj subfactor ( see @xcite ) constructed from the coxeter graph @xmath44 with the distinguished vertex being the trivalent one .",
    "each of the intermediate inclusions has index @xmath45 and the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is @xmath46 .",
    "the principal graph of @xmath17 is and the full intermediate subfactor lattice is where the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is also @xmath49 but @xmath8 and @xmath9 both commute with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "moreover @xmath50=[s : n]=2 $ ] and @xmath51 and @xmath52 form a commuting cocommuting square .",
    "the planar algebra of @xmath17 is isomorphic to its dual - the planar algebra of @xmath53 .",
    "note that from ocneanu s paragroup point of view @xmath12 is the fixed point algebra of an action of the paragroup given by the planar algebra on @xmath14 .",
    "thus if the ambient factor @xmath14 is hyperfinite , popa s theorem in @xcite guarantees that the subactors are unique up to an automorphism of @xmath14 . also note that it is a consequence of the theorem that any intermediate subfactor lattice with four elements and no extra structure is a commuting square .",
    "our methods rely heavily on planar algebras .",
    "of crucial importance is the diagram discovered by landau for the projection onto the product @xmath54 .",
    "we give a proof of landau s result and some general consequences .",
    "the uniqueness of the subfactor of index @xmath11 mentioned in the theorem is proved using the `` exchange relation '' of @xcite - the planar algebras have a very simple skein theory in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the no extra structure hypothesis necessary for the theorem is in fact weaker than the one we have stated above . for a precise statement of the required supertransitivity see [ cocommthm ] and [ mainchance ] .",

    "we will use it heavily in this paper so we recall some of the essentials the specific uses of the calculus in this paper make possible a couple of simplifying conventions for the pictures .    in its most recent formulation in @xcite a planar algebra",

    "the vector spaces @xmath130 form an algebra over the planar operad which means that there are multilinear maps between the @xmath130 indexed by planar tangles .",

    "the axioms of a planar algebra are that the multilinear maps be independent of isotopies globably fixing the boundary of @xmath138 and compatible with the gluing of tangles in a sense made clear in @xcite . to indicate the value of a tangle on its arguments one simply inserts the arguments in the internal discs .",
    "this notation for an element of @xmath18 is called a labelled tangle .",
    "for instance for @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , the labelled tangle below is the element of @xmath148 obtained by applying the multilinear map defined by the tangle above to the elements @xmath149 according to the discs in which they are placed .",
    "+    we refer to @xcite for details on the meaning of various tangles and the fact that the standard invariant of a subfactor is a planar algebra .",
    "recall that closed strings in a tangle can always be removed , each one counting for a multiplicative factor of the parameter @xmath150 which is the square root of the index for a subfactor planar algebra . to avoid both the shading and the marking of the distinguished boundary interval we will adopt the following convention :    all discs will be replaced by rectangles called  boxes \" .",
    "the distinguished boundary points will be on a pair of opposite edges of each box , called the top and bottom .",
    "labels will be well chose letters which have a top and bottom which will allow us to say which edge is top and which is bottom . the distinguished interval will be supposed shaded and always be between the first and second strings on the top of a box . this allows us to put elements of @xmath151 in the boxes so we further adopt the convention that if @xmath152 is in @xmath153 it will be inserted at right angles to the top - bottom axis of its rectangle , which is to be interpreted as an internal disc whose distinguished ( unshaded ) interval is the edge of the rectangle to which the letter points upwards .",
