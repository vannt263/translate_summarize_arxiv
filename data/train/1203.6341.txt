    "in recent years there has been much interest in the sommerfeld enhancement that arises when a scattering object is coupled to a light mediator .",
    "this enhancement can increase the cross section for scattering / annihilation processes in a velocity - dependent fashion ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) . in this work we consider the sommerfeld enhancement experienced by a scattering object that is coupled to a tower of mediators .",
    "this can occur in , e.g. , models of secluded dark matter  @xcite when a hierarchically small mediator - scale is generated naturally by hidden - sector confinement  @xcite . as a specific example , we consider a scattering object that is charged under a weakly - gauged global @xmath1 symmetry of a ( broken ) cft .",
    "we show that the enhancement can increase as a result of multi - mediator exchange .",
    "the basic point is straight forward .",
    "if the scattering field ( here called @xmath2 , with mass @xmath3 ) is coupled to multiple mediators ( @xmath4 , with masses @xmath5 ) , the exchange of this `` tower '' of mediators can modify the sommerfeld enhancement relative to the standard single - mediator result .",
    "it is easy to see how such a situation could arise .",
    "consider the case where @xmath2 is charged under a @xmath1 symmetry , with the corresponding gauge boson ( @xmath6 ) playing the role of sommerfeld - mediator .",
    "now let the @xmath1 factor also weakly - gauge a global symmetry of a strongly - interacting sector that confines in the infrared ( ir ) at a scale @xmath7 .",
    "the confinement is such that @xmath1 is broken during the phase transition and the mass of the corresponding gauge boson is set by the confinement scale , @xmath8 .",
    "one can think of the confining sector as providing a technically natural ( i.e. radiatively stable ) way to generate the hierarchy @xmath9 .",
    "if the strongly - interacting sector contains spin - one states , these may mix with @xmath6 , much like the photon mixes with the @xmath10-meson in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the lightest spin - one states will typically have masses on the order of @xmath11 , and thus the mixing induces effective interactions between @xmath2 and multiple light mediators .",
    "these extra mediators can modify the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the study of such a system is complicated by the invocation of a strongly - interacting sector .",
    "fortunately , however , via the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , one can construct weakly - coupled dual theories for classes of strongly - interacting 4d models . using this approach one can construct models",
    "in which a fundamental ( or non - composite ) field @xmath2 is charged under a weakly - gauged @xmath1 symmetry of a strongly - interacting conformal sector .",
    "when the conformal symmetry is broken at a scale @xmath7 , such that the @xmath1 symmetry is also broken , one arrives at a calculable model with multiple mediators .",
    "more specifically , the lagrangian for the dual 4d theory of a bulk vector in a slice of @xmath12 contains the terms   =   _  +  _  +   _   +   a_^ _  +    , where @xmath13 creates spin - one states in the conformal sector .",
    "observe that the last term mixes @xmath6 with the spin - one states of the cft  if @xmath2 has non - zero @xmath1 charge it thus acquires a coupling to the cft modes .",
    "the operator @xmath13 describes the cft in the conformal regime , while at energies @xmath14 it describes the discrete composite spin - one states . ]",
    "our main interest is in studying the sommerfeld enhancement due to a tower of mediators . to understand our analysis one need not be familiar with the details of warped 5d models , nor the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "instead it suffices to consider an effective action of the form sd^4x \\{i|^ _ + _ n e_n|^_^n- m|},[dm_action_tower_intro ] in which the tower of mediators , labeled by @xmath15 , have ordered masses ( @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) and couplings ( @xmath18 for @xmath17 ) .",
    "as we will show , this scenario can be motivated by considering weakly - coupled dual 5d theories , which generate specific relations among the masses @xmath19 , and the couplings @xmath20 .",
    "although our purpose is to study this system in a general sense , we note that much of the recent interest in the sommerfeld enhancement has related to experiments like pamela  @xcite , _ fermi _",
    "@xcite and atic  @xcite .",
    "these experiments observe an unexpected increase in the cosmic - lepton signal at energies @xmath21  gev , suggesting a new source of high energy electrons and positrons .",
    "it was conjectured that this lepton excess could be an indirect signal of wimp dark matter ( dm ) annihilations , as occurs in models where dm annihilates into a light mediator  @xcite .",
    "typically , the cross section required to explain the lepton signal is larger than the expected freeze - out cross section by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "however , the mediator increases the present - day low - velocity annihilation cross section via the sommerfeld effect , enabling models where the dm achieves thermalization in the early universe and yet annihilates to ( potentially ) produce the present - day lepton signal . though it is not our intention ( or focus ) to construct models along this line , we briefly comment on the use of our results within this context .",
    "a more detailed analysis of dm coupled to a tower of mediators will appear elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper , for the sommerfeld enhancement from a tower of mediators admitting a dual description , are necessary in order to understand the cosmic ray signal in the companion paper . also note that the enhancement due to multiple mediators could also be of interest in more general frameworks .",
    "for example , when a scattering object is charged under a @xmath1 factor that kinetically mixes with multiple other @xmath1 factors  @xcite , or when a @xmath1 symmetry is broken by a strongly - coupled sector that does not admit a dual description .",
    "in such cases the coupling and mass relations among mediators will differ , though our basic methodology will apply .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : single_med ] we briefly review aspects of the standard ( single - mediator ) sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "sections  [ sec : somm_tower_no_spilt ] and  [ sec : split_sommer_tower ] contain our discussion of the sommerfeld enhancement for a tower of mediators , in the elastic ( dirac ) , and inelastic ( majorana ) , cases respectively .",
    "a weakly - coupled dual model is presented in section  [ sec : dual_model ] .",
    "we note that familiarity with section  [ sec : dual_model ] is not necessary in order to follow the earlier sections ; the latter affect the former only via the particular relations employed for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "some brief comments in relation to the cosmic - lepton excess appear in section  [ sec : cosmic_lepton ] .",
    "the paper concludes in section  [ sec : conc ] and more details regarding the dual model appear in an appendix .",
    "in the sections that follow we obtain the sommerfeld enhancement for a 4d fermion coupled to a tower of vector mediators . as a helpful point of reference",
    ", we briefly discuss aspects of the standard sommerfeld enhancement for a scattering object of mass @xmath3 coupled to a mediator @xmath23 .",

    "the sommerfeld enhancement @xmath24 from a central potential @xmath25 is found by solving the following schrdinger equation , -  +  v(r)=.[sommerfeld_schrodinger ] we first consider a coulomb potential , @xmath26 .",

    "in these units the range of the potential is @xmath34 .",
    "( [ yukawa_sommerfeld_eq ] ) can be solved numerically , subject to the boundary conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",

    "the fixed value @xmath35 is used in the plot and the enhancement is shown as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "there are two key features to observe .",
    "firstly , the enhancement saturates for small values of @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the yukawa potential is well approximated by its leading term and behaves effectively like a coulomb potential , giving @xmath38 , in accordance with .",
    "secondly , the enhancement displays resonances in the regime @xmath39 .",
    "semi - analytic results show that these resonances occur at @xmath40 for integer @xmath41 , giving @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "thus , the enhancement goes like @xmath43 on - resonance .",
    "also note that the enhancement turns off for @xmath44 .",
    "we are interested in the sommerfeld enhancement for a scattering object that couples to a tower of mediators .",
    "label the tower by integer @xmath15 , such that the masses and couplings are ordered with @xmath16 , and @xmath45 , for @xmath17 .",
    "the latter condition need not hold for an arbitrary tower of mediators , but holds for a tower admitting a weakly - coupled dual description ( see section  [ sec : dual_model ] ) . in this case , the masses are related via m_0_m_n~n_n1 , where @xmath46 is an ir mass - gap / confinement - scale . furthermore , the couplings are related as @xmath47 for @xmath48 ( see ) .",
    "we use this case as a concrete example but otherwise aim to keep the discussion general .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement from the tower of mediators follows from employing a sum over yukawa potentials : v(r)&=&_nv_n=-_n=0  e^-m_n r. in the limit that the modes with @xmath41 decouple , the lightest mode ( @xmath49 ) serves as a standard mediator .",

    ", one can , in general , cut the sum off at some value @xmath50 .",
    "the reason for this is readily understood .",
    "the standard enhancement turns off for @xmath51 . for a tower of mediators such that @xmath52 , the zero - mode enhancement is `` turned on '' and there will , in general , exist a value of @xmath53 such that @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "thus , for @xmath55 the enhancement from the @xmath56-th mode turns off . for the specific case of a tower admitting a weakly - coupled dual description",
    ", we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath41 ) , so that @xmath59 .",
    "thus , we can cut the sum off at @xmath60 .",
    "physically , this is equivalent to the statement that the non - relativistic scattering of particles with mass @xmath3 is insensitive to short distance physics at scales @xmath61 , and such heavy modes can be integrated out .    for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the potentials @xmath64 for @xmath41",
    "are subdominant to the zero - mode potential ( @xmath65 ) at large @xmath66 .",
    "the long - distance behavior of the solution is therefore governed by the lightest mode and @xmath67 for @xmath68 , as one would expect . on the other hand , when @xmath69 the exponentials can become unimportant .",
    "indeed , for @xmath70 one can approximate the zero - mode potential by a coulomb potential , @xmath71 . in this region of parameter space",
    "the contribution from the higher modes is  _",

    "this approximation in the schrdinger equation one finds  +  \\{1 + _ n=1^n _ } -_v^2,__v[kk_yukawa_sommerfeld_approx ]  . upon defining an effective coupling ,",
    "n=0^n__n  , and changing variables to @xmath76 , we rewrite as -  -   = |_v^2[kk_coulomb_sommerfeld_eq ]  , where @xmath77 . comparing with and using we immediately deduce the enhancement in the limit @xmath78 , s=\\{_n^n_}.[small_ephi_limit ] we will show in section  [ sec : dual_model ] that one can approximate the sum , giving s & & \\{1 + }  , [ inelastic_saturated_enhancement ] for the small-@xmath36 enhancement .",
    "observe that the deviation from the standard ( single mediator ) small-@xmath36 result increases with decreasing @xmath36 .",
    "for example : s&&\\ {    cccc 1.11&&&_~10 ^ -2 + 1.16&&&_~10 ^ -3    .  , [ sommer_planck_rough ] with @xmath79 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , relative to the standard result the enhancement is increased by a factor of @xmath80 for @xmath73 .",
    "a more careful numerical treatment , gives @xmath81 for @xmath82 , in agreement with the estimate .",
    ", the estimate is smaller than the exact result as it neglects the @xmath56-dependence of the logarithms that appear in @xmath20 , and thus slightly underestimates the couplings @xmath20 for @xmath41 . ]",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement due to the tower , along with the pure zero - mode result , is plotted as a function of @xmath36 in figure  [ zoom_sommerfeld_standard_yukawa ] for the fixed value @xmath35 ( with @xmath83 ) .",
    "the latter result is equivalent to the standard enhancement from a single mediator with mass @xmath84 and coupling @xmath85 .",
    "observe that the discrepancy between the standard result ( lower curve ) , and the enhancement from the tower ( upper curve ) , increases with decreasing @xmath36 .",
    "this is because more members of the tower contribute to the enhancement as one decreases @xmath36 . for fixed @xmath85 ,",
    "@xmath36 decreases with decreasing @xmath46  a limit that results in more members of the tower having mass @xmath86 , and therefore increases the number of modes that contribute to the enhancement .. if @xmath3 gets too large ( @xmath87 ) , the gravity description in the dual theory breaks down and the back reaction of @xmath2 should be included .",
    "furthermore , the limit @xmath88 removes the mass gap of the cft , and the mediator @xmath6 becomes non - dynamical as its coupling runs to zero in the ir  @xcite . for @xmath89 and finite @xmath11 , the present analysis , based on a dual description , can be trusted . ]",
    "also note that the two curves agree for larger values of @xmath36 , demonstrating the insensitivity to the heavier mediators in this limit . for values of @xmath36",
    "even larger than appears in the figure , the difference between the standard single - mediator result and the tower is negligible , and in both cases the enhancement turns off completely for @xmath90 .",
    "also note that the location of the resonances is not significantly affected by the tower , due to the dominant coupling of the lightest mode . in models where the couplings are not ordered as @xmath45 for @xmath17 ,",
    "this feature would not , in general , persist .",
    "we note that figure  [ zoom_sommerfeld_standard_yukawa ] shows the _ minimal _ increase due to the tower ( for a given value of @xmath36 ) . for smaller values of @xmath72 ,",
    "the increase in the sommerfeld enhancement can be larger and can even approach @xmath91 values with @xmath92 .",
    "this is easily seen by taking @xmath93 in .",
    "however , such small values of @xmath72 require a more careful treatment with the sum evaluated numerically ( to account for the full @xmath56-dependence of the logarithms in ) .",
    "this analysis bears out that the enhancement increases for smaller values of @xmath94 .",
    "thus , if the uv scale is @xmath94 a greater enhancements result .",
    "physically , the increase in the enhancement results from the fact that the ratio of couplings in the dual theory goes like ~  n>1  .",
    "this ratio increases with decreasing @xmath95 .",
    "the heavier mediators therefore couple more strongly to the scattering field as @xmath95 decreases , thereby increasing their contribution to the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "thus , we can generalize the results by saying that , e.g. , the increase in the enhancement is @xmath96 for @xmath97 when @xmath98 .    to summarize , for small values of @xmath70 , the sommerfeld enhancement from a tower of mediators is larger than the standard single - mediator saturated off - resonant result by a factor of @xmath99 $ ] : ss_0  , where @xmath100 is the small-@xmath36 off - resonant result due to a standard attractive yukawa potential .",
    "this increase results from an effective increase in the coupling , @xmath101 . for larger @xmath36",
    "the exponential suppression in the yukawa - potentials for the heavier modes is important and , in particular , the potential due to the heavier mediators becomes negligible relative to that of the lighter ones .",
    "the smooth transition from the regime where only the zero - mode is important to that where heavier mediators play a roll is seen clearly in figure  [ zoom_sommerfeld_standard_yukawa ] : for small @xmath37 the enhancement is larger due to the sum , but smoothly transitions to the standard value with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "thus far we have considered the sommerfeld enhancement for a dirac fermion ( the elastic case ) .",
    "standard calculations show that a small mass - splitting can increase the overall size of the sommerfeld effect , both on- and off - resonance , and shift the location of the resonances  @xcite . in this section",
    "we comment on the sommerfeld enhancement from a tower of mediators in the inelastic case , i.e.  the dirac fermion is now split into two majorana fermions with some small mass - splitting . our presentation will be brief as our main points follow readily from the previous section .",
    "we limit our attention to a few key differences relative to the single - mediator analysis and follow the notations of ref .",

    "we note the following limits , which are useful for our purposes . in the regime @xmath109 ,",
    "the enhancement becomes s,[mass_split_sommer ] which is larger than the elastic ( @xmath110 ) result by a factor of two .",
    "also , in the limit @xmath111 one finds that the enhancement saturates at  @xcite s=()^-1 > .",
    "we would like to understand the sommerfeld enhancement due to a tower of mediators .",
    "following the previous section , we define the dimensionless quantities in terms of the zero - mode mass and coupling ( i.e. @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) and the yukawa potentials in @xmath114 are replaced by a sum over mediators : \\{e^-_x + _",
    "n>0  e^-_n_x}. based on the insights obtained in the elastic case , we can already deduce the following . for larger values of @xmath36",
    "the enhancement should reduce to the standard expressions obtained with a single mediator . in this limit",
    "the exponential suppression of the heavier modes renders their contribution to the potential negligible relative to that of the zero - mode , and the latter essentially mimics a standard mediator .    on the other hand , for small values of @xmath115 ,",
    "some of the exponentials are well approximated by their leading term , giving rise to an effective sum over coulomb potentials , while others are exponentially suppressed . in this regime",
    "the standard analysis carries through , modulo the replacement @xmath116 .",

    "once again the enhancement is increased by ( at least ) a factor of @xmath0 relative to the standard result , with the precise increase dependent on the the uv scale @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , compared to the standard off - resonant sommerfeld enhancement with no mass splittings ( @xmath38 for @xmath37 ) , the enhancement is increased by a factor @xmath121 for @xmath122 when both a mass - splitting and the tower of mediators is included .    in the limit @xmath111 , with small @xmath123 , one obtains s=()^-1 > , where the `` barred '' quantities are obtained from their `` unbarred '' counterparts by the replacement @xmath124 .",
    "this lower bound saturates at s>=\\{1 + }  .",
    "thus we find that , relative to the single - mediator result , the saturated value of the sommerfeld enhancement in the inelastic case is enhanced by the tower of mediators in both the small @xmath36 and the small @xmath125 limits . in the non - limiting cases the enhancement is readily found numerically by following the procedures outlined in ref .",

    "( with @xmath159 ) .",
    "we note that the effective theory describing the uv - localized field @xmath2 is governed by the local 4d cutoff @xmath160 , for which we have focused on @xmath161 .",
    "one can trust the theory describing @xmath2 for energies @xmath162 and therefore calculations for the production / absorption of bulk - vector kk modes locally on the uv - brane are reliable .",
    "the kk modes themselves experience strong interactions in the bulk for scales @xmath163 , however , this does not alter the local uv physics .",
    "given the interest in the sommerfeld enhancement due to the cosmic - lepton - excess , it is appropriate to comment on the applicability of our results in this context , even if only to avoid perfidious implication . we restrict ourselves to a few brief comments as a more detailed analysis of dm in related scenarios",
    "will appear elsewhere .",
    "it has been suggested that the cosmic lepton excess observed by pamela , _ fermi _ , and others , may be explained in terms of tev - scale dark matter annihilating into a light mediator with mass @xmath164  gev  @xcite . the boosted final - state mediators decay to the sm , and",
    "if the mediator mass is below the gev scale , decays to anti - protons are forbidden , in accordance with the data .",
    "decays to light sm fields , like electrons , muons or pions , are allowed , subject to the details of the model .",
    "these light sm fields are highly boosted and thus provide a candidate explanation for the cosmic lepton excess .",
    "the present - day annihilation cross section required to explain the data is much higher [ ] than the usual wimp cross section , @xmath165 .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement increases the present - day annihilation cross section , though it can be difficult to obtain a large - enough enhancement to ensure compatibility with the data ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if the dm has a mass - splitting , the situation is more promising due to the increased enhancement shown in  @xcite .",
    "the existence of local substructure in the dm halo can also improve the fit to the data  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that recent gamma - ray observations of the galactic center by hess disfavor large regions of the parameter space , subject to the precise nature of the dm density profile of the milky way contains a constant - density core  @xcite . ]  @xcite .",
    "also note that other astrophysical explanations for the lepton - excess exist ( e.g.  @xcite ) , some of which make predictions for the @xmath166 ratio expected in cosmic ray fluxes  @xcite .",
    "given the increase in the sommerfeld enhancement obtained with a tower of mediators , it is of interest to determine if this result could aid in accommodating the data .",
    "we will make some preliminary comments on the specific case considered here ( a tower of mediators admitting a weakly - coupled dual description ) .",
    "the main point to make is that the application of these results would involve a non - standard dm scenario .",
    "weakly - coupled warped models of the type considered here are dual to large-@xmath167 cfts with @xmath167 estimated to be on the order of @xmath168  @xcite .",
    "the likely utility of this framework depends on whether the cft modes are in equilibrium in the early universe .",
    "clearly , if @xmath169 the number of degrees of freedom thermalized in the early universe can be dominated by the cft , giving @xmath170 . in this case the dm freeze - out cross section must be lower than the standard wimp value in order to achieve the right abundance .",
    "in addition , the running of the @xmath1 coupling constant can be modified due to cft loops , which can reduce the low - energy coupling relative to models with less degrees of freedom .",
    "this exacerbates the need for a present - day sommerfeld enhancement , which will have to exceed the `` standard '' value of @xmath22 .",
    "however , this feature is precisely that required if there are sizable amounts of local substructure .",
    "indeed , the model falls under the category of `` new irrelevant channels '' according to the definitions of  @xcite . on the other hand , if the dm is produced non - thermally by inflaton decays or some other such mechanism , as may be needed if the early universe is not reheated above the ir scale @xmath11 , the cft modes need not be in equilibrium in the early universe . in this case",
    "the typical dm annihilation cross section may remain on the order of the standard wimp value , and the increased sommerfeld enhancement could be useful in bringing the present - day annihilation cross - section in line with experimental requirements .",
    "there are a number of other details that could also come into play ; for example , there would be extra annihilation channels involving higher kk modes , which would affect the thermal history in the early universe and the annihilation spectrum in the present - day .",
    "we will discuss these matters in a forthcoming work  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the sommerfeld enhancement due to a tower of mediators , specializing to a system in which the scattering object is charged under a weakly - gauged global symmetry of a strongly - interacting ( broken ) cft .",
    "this scenario can be motivated in models of secluded dark matter in which the mediator scale is generated by hidden - sector confinement .",
    "the resulting composites contribute to the enhancement .",
    "we find that the exchange of multiple mediators can increase the enhancement in the off - resonant region ; for a scattering object of mass @xmath171  tev and a lightest mediator at the gev scale , the increase is found to be @xmath0 for @xmath172 .",
    "the enhancement increases if the conformal symmetry is broken in the uv at scales @xmath173 , due to the increased coupling strength of the tower of mediators .",
    "a weakly - coupled dual model was employed in our analysis , though the general idea admits wider applicability .",
    "the author is most grateful to b.  v.  harling and t.  slatyer .",
    "we briefly consider the kk spectrum of the bulk vector , following the hidden - vector discussion of  @xcite .",
    "the action for a bulk @xmath1 symmetry on a slice of @xmath12 is s & & - d^4xdzg^mag^nb_mn_ab , where @xmath174 is the field strength for the bulk vector @xmath175 .",
    "symmetry breaking can be induced by an explicit higgs or by imposing a dirichlet boundary condition on the ir brane  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the higgsless case ( in unitary gauge with @xmath176 ) .",
    "the 5d gauge field is kk expanded as _ ( x , z ) = _ nf_n(z)^n_(x ) , where the bulk wave functions satisfy  @xcite f_n(z ) & = & 0 , +  f_n(z )  f_m(z)&=&_nm .",
    "the solutions , in terms of the bessel functions @xmath177 and @xmath178 , are f_n(z ) = \\{j_1(m_nz ) + _ ny_1(m_nz)}. [ wavefunc - gauge ] a neumann boundary condition at the uv brane ( @xmath179 ) leads to _",
    "n = -  , where the last expression holds for @xmath155 and @xmath180 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath19 are fixed by the dirichlet boundary condition in the ir , _",
    "[ dirichletfreq ] for @xmath56 greater than a few , the kk masses are well approximated by @xmath181 , while the mass of the lightest mode ( @xmath49 ) is m_0 .",
    "this mode has a wavefunction given by eq .   with @xmath182 . the uv - localized field @xmath2 couples to the kk modes with strength @xmath183 , which depends on the uv values of the kk wave functions .",
    "these may be approximated as f_0(k^-1 ) & & -  , + f_n(k^-1 ) & &  ,  n 1 . [ epsilonn ] for @xmath184 , the coupling strength for the higher kk modes can be approximately related to that of the zero mode : e_n   n>0.[app_coupling_rel ] the ratio @xmath185 increases with decreasing @xmath127 , and thus the higher modes couple more strongly as the uv scale is decreased .",
    "in addition , the particle spectrum contains a tower of massive kk gravitons , whose spectrum is found by perturbing the background metric in the usual way  @xcite .",
    "the massless zero - mode is the standard 4d graviton .",
    "irrespective of the value of @xmath127 , the couplings of the kk gravitons to the uv localized fermion @xmath2 are highly suppressed  @xcite and play no direct role in our analysis . the gravitons couple to the kk vectors and",
    "thus influence their decay properties ( see  @xcite for details ) but are not important in this work .",
