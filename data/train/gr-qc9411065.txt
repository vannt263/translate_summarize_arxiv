    "<S> we study the process of the evolution of the space of extra dimensions in the framework of einstein - yang - mills cosmological models . it is shown that , for certain classes of models , the static compact space of extra dimensions is the attractor for a wide range of initial conditions . </S>",

    "<S> the most important of them are the following :    \\a ) the model should possess a solution describing an expanding three- dimensional space to the present size of the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> \\b ) the scale factor(s ) @xmath1 of the space of extra dimensions should decrease up to a size @xmath2 in the course of the evolution , described by the same solution , and the model should have a mechanism for stopping the contraction or at least slowing it down considerably at this value of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds on the variation of @xmath3 following from the yield of primordial @xmath4 are : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the present size of the space of extra dimensions and @xmath7 its size at the time of the nucleosynthesis @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we would like to remark that many of the multidimensional cosmological models considered in the literature do not exhibit some and in some cases none of these basic properties . </S>",
    "<S> examples of these are kasner - type solutions in @xmath8 dimensions and models dominated by the energy density of radiation ( see eg . </S>",

    "<S> the isotropization of the space of extra dimensions metric will be also shown .    the models are formulated on the manifold @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the four - dimensional part of the space - time and @xmath11 is a compact homogeneous @xmath12-dimensional space on which the group @xmath13 acts transitively . </S>",

    "<S> we consider the class of models with metric @xmath23 given by : @xmath24 the four - dimensional part of the metric is the one corresponding to a flrw model and the metric on @xmath25 is the most general @xmath13-invariant metric . </S>",

    "<S> for the models considered here the potential posseses at least one minimum due to the non - trivial monopole contribution . in general , depending on the initial conditions , the evolution leads to one of the two situations :    \\i ) all or some of the scales @xmath31 tend to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to decompactification , i.e. unlimited growth of the size of extra dimensions , and is physically unacceptable .    </S>",

    "<S> the dashed lines represent the levels of constant @xmath56 : @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the former one corresponds to the planckian energy densities and thus limits the sector of the classical dynamics , i.e. the region of values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 where the energy density of the field is smaller than @xmath61 and hence the classical equations of motion make sense . we suppose that the universe started its classical evolution from small values of @xmath1 and we consider the case where the initial value @xmath62 . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows two typical trajectories ( thin lines ) corresponding to the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) of sect . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    the thick line in fig . 1 is the boundary of the trapped region @xmath63 , i.e. the part of the phase space for which the minimum @xmath64 is the attractor . lacking a satisfactory quantum theory of gravity </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to know the intial conditions for the classical evolution of the universe . if we follow the conventional hot big bang scenario , the trapped region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 corresponds to the region where the initial conditions at the moment , when the universe enters the low temperature regime , should lie for the compactification to be successful . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the large part of the classical region lies inside @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now scenarios based on the quantum creation of the universe . in this case , according to the vilenkin distribution for @xmath59 @xcite or the hartle - hawking distribution function @xcite , the universe was probably created with @xmath65 away from the origin of the potential , i.e. where @xmath66 , or on the top of the local maximum of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> ( these statements , however , should be taken with caution since the potential ( [ wsymm ] ) strictly speaking does not satisfy the condition of slow variation . ) fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows that in both cases the initial state is within the trapped region and the universe always approaches the @xmath67 space - time with @xmath40 . for other numbers of the extra dimensions </S>",
    "<S> the situation is qualitatively the same , but for increasing @xmath12 the region @xmath63 extends itself towards the direction of negative values for @xmath59 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the space of extra dimensions is a six - dimensional non - symmetric homogeneous space , known as the @xmath69 manifold , with the anisotropic metric ( [ metric ] ) parametrized by two scales ( @xmath70 ) . </S>",
    "<S> after fine tuning @xmath19 , as in sect . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the potential , @xmath30 , has a minimum at @xmath71 with @xmath72 and a saddle point with @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> its explicit form as a function of the two scalar fields , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , was calculated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 represents the contour plot of the potential in the @xmath76-plane and the levels @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where , @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 decreases exponentially for @xmath78 and grows exponentially when @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the line @xmath80 corresponds to the isotropic @xmath81-invariant metric on @xmath82 ( unsquashed @xmath69 ) , which is of course topologically equivalent to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the thick closed curve is the boundary of the trapped region , which in this case , is the region of initial conditions @xmath83 for which compactification is successful . for all initial conditions of this type , with @xmath84 situated in the classical region @xmath85 , the minimum of the potential @xmath86 is the attractor . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for initial conditions favoured by scenarios of the quantum creation of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> it appeares that , in this model , isotropy in the space of extra dimensions is restored dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> two typical trajectories with highly anisotropic initial metric ( i.e. with @xmath87 ) are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that after a few oscillations the trajectories approach the line of isotropic metrics , for which @xmath88 , and the main part of evolution occurs in the narrow vicinity of this line .    * </S>",

    "<S> * thus we have shown that the einstein - yang - mills cosmological models considered here satisfy conditions ( b ) and ( c ) of sect 1 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a @xmath89 universe with constant radii for the space of extra dimensions is achieved for a wide range of initial conditions in the hot big bang scenario and for the initial states suggested by scenarios of quantum creation of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the model with two scales in the space @xmath90 , it was shown that isotropization occurs , i.e. the metric tends to the one with higher symmetry in the course of its evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> what about conditions ( a ) and ( d ) above ? during the evolution of @xmath29 , </S>",
    "<S> the scale factor of the 3-dimensional space expands according to the law @xmath91 with @xmath92 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our models do not describe inflationary expansion without , for instance , additional scalar fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of effects due to particle production ( see @xcite ) and vacuum polarization might also help in achieving power law inflation in these models . </S>",
    "<S> once the scales of the extra dimensions have reached their minimum , then the main contribution to expansion comes from radiation and further evolution of @xmath50 follows the standard radiation - dominated scenarios . to check whether the models satisfy condition ( d ) further calculations are needed . </S>",
