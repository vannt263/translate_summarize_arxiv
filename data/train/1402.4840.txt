    "from the mathematical point of view , naked singularities are just as valid as black holes ( bhs ) , if regarded as solutions of general relativity ( gr ) . nevertheless , the appearance of a naked singularity as the endpoint of the evolution of regular and generic initial data would configure a ` breakdown of predictability ' within gr .",
    "to avoid such a menace to the self - consistency of the theory , penrose proposed back in 1969  @xcite what is now known as the ( weak ) cosmic censorship conjecture : any naked singularities formed in such a process always appear cloaked by an event horizon .    despite many efforts over several decades",
    ", cosmic censorship remains unproven .",
    "this state of affairs naturally fostered attempts to disprove the conjecture by devising counter - examples .",
    "the first tests of the cosmic censorship were conducted by wald  @xcite and consisted of attempts to overspin / overcharge four - dimensional bhs with point particles .",
    "the family of rotating and charged black holes  known as kerr - newman solutions  is described by mass @xmath2 , angular momentum @xmath3 and electric charge @xmath4 .",
    "the existence of an event horizon covering the central curvature singularity imposes a bound on these parameters , .",
    "[ eq : bound ] this inequality is saturated for extremal bhs and if the bound is violated one obtains a naked singularity . by considering an initially extremal kerr - newman black hole ,",
    "wald showed that point particles with enough angular momentum ( charge ) to overspin ( overcharge ) the bh are never captured , thus rendering such an attempt to disprove cosmic censorship unsuccessful .",
    "some years later hubeny  @xcite relaxed the extremality condition and demonstrated that an initially _ near - extremal _ reissner - nordstrm bh could be overcharged by a test particle . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors obtained similar results considering initially _ near - extremal _ kerr and kerr - newman bhs respectively .",
    "the validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture has also been investigated in higher dimensions  @xcite , with a cosmological constant  @xcite or considering quantum tunneling effects  @xcite .",
    "there are however indications that backreaction effects , which are typically neglected in studies reporting violation of cosmic censorship , restore the integrity of the bh horizon  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we perform numerical tests of the cosmic censorship  in the spirit of wald s classic gedanken experiment  with rotating higher dimensional bhs with a negative cosmological constant , the so - called myers - perry - ads spacetimes .",
    "an extremal bound analogous to   also exists for such solutions , but in this case it depends on the ratios between the several possible spin parameters .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that , in odd dimensions ( @xmath5 ) , when all angular momenta are equal  and we restrict to this case  the solution is cohomogeneity-1  @xcite .",
    "thus the problem depends on a single ( radial ) coordinate , which amounts to a technical simplification .",
    "we will present in detail the five - dimensional case but we also report our results for higher odd dimensions , specifically for @xmath6 .    besides being an interesting mathematical problem on its own right ,",
    "the investigation of the cosmic censorship in higher dimensions is strongly motivated by recent numerical evidence in favor of its violation in five dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a cosmological constant brings about added interest . from the viewpoint of the ads / cft correspondence , an over - extremal bh in ads translates into a state on the boundary field theory rotating faster than the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although the analysis of a ring of test particles infalling into the three - dimensional rotating bh in ads did not reveal any sign of cosmic censorship violation  @xcite , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite  by constructing exact thin - shell solutions  that in three dimensions cosmic censorship can be violated if the matter on the shell has non - vanishing pressure .    the outline of the paper is the following . in section  [ sec : es - mp - ads ] we briefly present the black hole geometries we shall consider .",

    "it will be convenient to employ a dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath41 as well as dimensionless combinations for mass and spin , namely m , j ^n-1 , [ eq : dimlessparams ] in terms of which the metric function @xmath42 becomes g()^-2 = 1++2 m ^-(n+1 ) .",

[ eq : relategmunu ] the geodesics we shall consider for the test particles are the generalization of eq .  , ( ) = 0 , [ eq : geodesicsn ] which implies in particular @xmath52 , and therefore satisfy l_^i= a_^i l _ , which follows from eqs .  , and  .",
    "the remaining equations governing the test particle trajectories are easily obtained by inverting   and   and using @xmath53 for the radial equation : & = & , + & = & , + ^2 & = & - , [ eq : radialequation ] where @xmath54 for timelike or null geodesics , respectively . in these equations the metric functions",
    "@xmath55 should all be understood as functions of @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 .",
    "one final comment is in order before conducting the test of the cosmic censorship in the next section .",
    "it is not obvious how to define separately the ` black hole ' and the ` test particle ' when the latter can not be moved all the way out to timelike infinity .",
    "therefore , for the spin - up analysis we will restrict to the case @xmath58 , since only null geodesics can extend all the way out to the boundary of ads .",
    "in order to test the cosmic censorship conjecture in a higher dimensional and asymptotically ads setting we will now attempt to spin up _ extremal _ myers - perry - ads black holes with all angular momenta equal .",
    "we thus take , as our background , solutions of the form   with initial mass @xmath59 and angular momentum @xmath60 corresponding to an extremal configuration with @xmath61 . note that the extremal value of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath62 depends on the dimensionless mass parameter @xmath63 .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of asymptotically flat black holes  @xcite , for which the extremal bound  with a different definition of the parameter @xmath62  turned out to be a ( dimension - dependent ) constant .",
    "this difference is intimately related with the fact that for a non - vanishing cosmological constant the physical mass of the spacetime depends explicitly on the spin parameter @xmath38 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "next , we try to overspin these black holes by throwing in @xmath64 identical particles , one along each orthogonal rotation plane , in order to preserve the equal angular momenta property of the background .",
    "all test particles have the same mass @xmath65 and the same conserved gravitational charges . if , as an outcome of the gedanken experiment , these particles fall past the event horizon , they will induce a change in mass and angular momentum of the black hole given respectively by m = e , j = l_. [ eq : variations1 ] these must satisfy @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the test particle limit to be valid .",
    "we thus regard @xmath68 as an infinitesimal quantity and present our final expressions as series expansions around @xmath69 truncated at first order .    the right hand side of eqs",
    ".   conforms with the energy and angular momentum carried by point particles in asymptotically flat spacetimes , for which asymptotically there is no gravitational potential .",
    "it is not immediate that the same expressions apply in the asymptotically ads case .",
    "nevertheless , one can compute the effect the introduction of a test particle in the background geometry has on the conserved charges of the spacetime .",
    "this was done in  @xcite and the results are consistent with the identification of the parameter @xmath70 with ` energy density ' and the parameter @xmath71 with ` angular momentum density ' .",
    "as mentioned above , we must first identify the class of extremal solutions among the family of equal angular momenta myers - perry - ads black holes in odd spacetime dimensions .",
    "this can be done analytically for asymptotically flat bhs but in the presence of a non - vanishing cosmological constant even this first step must be performed numerically . in any case",
    ", it amounts to determining the value of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath62 ( as a function of @xmath63 ) for which the event horizon is degenerate with the inner cauchy horizon .",
    "in other words , the extremal limit occurs when the metric function @xmath72 in eq .   features a double root for a positive value of @xmath73 , which corresponds to the horizon of the extremal black hole , @xmath74 .    in figure  [",

    "black holes with regular event horizons exist only in the shaded region below the extremal curve ( solid red ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction ( conveniently normalised ) of the bidimensional vector @xmath76 , as obtained in sec .",

    "the spin - up process conducted with extremal black holes and the potentially most dangerous geodesics yields a flow _ along _ the family of extremal solutions.,width=325 ]    the infinite @xmath7 limit of the extremal curve can nevertheless be obtained analytically .",
    "it follows straightforwardly from imposing the vanishing of eq .   and of its derivative at @xmath77 and then taking @xmath78 .",
    "the result for the extremal curve and its derivative is j_ext(m ) , j_ext(m ) - .",
    "[ eq : infiniten ]      the next step is to determine the critical value of the test particles angular momentum parameter @xmath71 ( for given energy perameter @xmath70 ) above ( below ) which the geodesics correspond to a bounce ( plunge ) in the extremal black hole background .",
    "equation   specifies the radial motion of the test - particles and we are interested in determining for which values of the pair @xmath79 the particle is absorbed by the black hole . considering only null geodesics , @xmath58 , we have r^2 + v(r ) = 0 , with the effective potential for radial motion given by v(r ) & & - ( 1 + ) e^2 + e + & & + .",

    "geodesics with @xmath84 are absorbed while geodesics with @xmath85 correspond to bounces.,width=325 ]      finally , we need to interpret our results to infer whether or not cosmic censorship conjecture is violated by wald s thought experiment in this higher - dimensional , asymptotically ads context .",
    "this is not as immediate as in ref .",
    "@xcite because the curve of extremal solutions @xmath86 depends on @xmath63 and this dependence is only known numerically . in general , the absorption of test - particles by the black hole will produce a change in the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath87 , as well as on the dimensionless mass parameter , @xmath88 .    upon absorption of the test particles , the dimensionless mass and spin of the bh , defined in eq .  ,",

    "the relative difference is somewhat larger but this is due to lack of resolution in the @xmath63 parameter .",
    "the attempt to spin - up extremal backgrounds with the potentially most dangerous geodesics  those with @xmath98  is on the verge of overspinning the black holes .",

    "we observed no violation of the conjecture .",
    "more interestingly , our results indicate that starting with an initially extremal bh and throwing in test particles that ( i ) preserve the equal angular momentum property of the background and ( ii ) carry the maximum allowed angular momentum for which absorption still occurs , one can indeed spin up the black hole but the outcome is a more massive bh which is also extremal .    in effect , the spin up process investigated originates a flow along the curve of extremal black holes .",

    "it is therefore tempting to speculate about the generalization of this result to other , possibly all , black hole solutions , irrespective of their asymptotics .",
    "based on the similarity of the results for the different dimensions analysed and the structure of the governing equations being the same , it is very likely that our conclusions apply to all odd higher dimensions as well .",
    "this is also supported by the relatively small difference between the extremal curve @xmath91 for @xmath99 and for @xmath94 [ see fig .  [",

    "violation of cosmic censorship was reported to occur for certain fine - tunned values of the parameters , still within the test particle approximation . however , timelike geodesics in asymptotically ads spacetimes always possess turning points outside the horizon .",
    "the physical meaning is clear : massive particles can not be sent into a black hole in ads from arbitrarily far away .",
    "instead , we have considered only massless particles that can travel in from spatial infinity , and our previous conjecture can only apply in this situation .",
    "finally , recall that the background metrics we attempted to spin up were strictly extremal , as opposed to near - extremal , and the effect of the absorption of point particles was only considered at first order .",
    "this is in keeping with the test particle approximation employed , but given the delicate outcome of our results it is conceivable that higher order effects might alter the picture . as usual backreaction effects , such as gravitational radiation emission and self - force that have been neglected ,",
