    "over the past five years , a major controversy has developed about the high - pressure melting curves of transition metals . according to static compression experiments , performed using diamond anvil cells ( dac ) at pressures from ambient up to @xmath3  gpa ( 1  mbar ) , the melting temperatures @xmath4 of many transition metals , particularly those having the b.c.c .",
    "crystal structure , change by no more than a few hundred  k over this pressure range  @xcite . in some cases",
    ", this finding seems to be in gross conflict with shock experiments , which indicate an increase of @xmath4 of several thousand k over the same pressure range  @xcite .",
    "theoretical work  @xcite based directly or indirectly on density functional theory ( dft ) generally supports the shock data .",
    "we report here a detailed dft study of the high - pressure melting curve of mo , a metal for which there are some of the largest differences between dac measurements and other data ( see e.g. fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there has already been quite extensive theoretical work on the high-@xmath5 melting of metals .",
    "some of this has been motivated by the desire to understand the properties of solid and liquid fe in the earth s core  @xcite .",
    "dft - based calculations of the fe melting curve  @xcite up the pressure at the boundary between the solid inner core and the liquid outer core provide one of the important ways of constraining the temperature distribution in the core .",
    "disagreements with dac measurements on fe and other transition metals are cause for concern , because if dft were shown to be seriously in error , the reliability of dft for the study of planetary interiors would be called into question . but even without this practical motivation , a major disagreement between dft predictions and experimental data must be taken seriously , because it suggests an unexpected failure either of commonly used dft approximations , or of apparently well established experimental techniques . reassuringly , dft melting curves agree very closely with experiment for some metals , including al  @xcite and cu  @xcite .",
    "the large disagreements arise mainly for transition metals , and the suggestion is that they are linked to d - band bonding .    since the melting slope @xmath2 is equal by the clausius - clapeyron relation to @xmath6 ,",
    "where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the volume and entropy of fusion , and since @xmath8 is unlikely to have exceptionally large values , a very low @xmath2 is likely to be due to a low volume of fusion .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that a low @xmath7 might be expected for b.c.c .",
    "transition metals , because the liquid may be more close packed than the solid . but",
    "recently , an additional argument has been advanced for low @xmath2 values  @xcite .",
    "this argument depends on the fact that the distribution of conduction electrons between s - p states and d states is known to depend on the degree of compression and on the crystal stucture  @xcite .",
    "the suggestion is that the ( assumed ) change of coordination on going from b.c.c .",
    "solid to liquid leads to a change of electronic structure , and hence a change in the electron distribution between s - p and d states , and that this redistribution stabilises the liquid and lowers @xmath4 .",
    "one of the important purposes of the present work is to use dft molecular dynamics ( m.d . )",
    "simulations to test these suggestions for the case of mo .",
    "there has been previous dft work  @xcite on the high - pressure melting of mo .",
    "the early work of moriarty  @xcite employed a many - body total energy function derived from first - principles `` generalized pseudopotential theory ''  @xcite .",
    "this approximates the total energy of the system in terms of volume dependent 1- , 2- , 3- and 4-body interatomic potentials , and accounts for the angular forces that are known to be important in transition metals .",
    "this form of total - energy function is designed to be fully transferable between different structures , and should be valid for both the solid and the liquid state .",
    "the model total - energy function was used in m.d .",
    "simulations to determine the melting curve by two methods .",
    "the first method consisted of cycling the simulated system up and down through the melting point at fixed volume .",
    "the results were cross - checked against a second method based on the calculation of the free energies of the solid and the liquid .",
    "this was pioneering work , but its quantitative accuracy can be questioned , because some of the phonon frequencies predicted by the total energy function agreed rather poorly with experiment .",
    "in addition , the surprising claim was made that @xmath4 could be changed by up to a factor of two by the inclusion of thermal electronic excitations , which were treated only crudely .",
    "the predicted melting curve was consistent with shock data , but was far above the curve given by recent dac measurements : the difference of @xmath4 values amounts to @xmath9  k at @xmath10  gpa . much more recently ,",
    "direct dft m.d .",
    "simulation has been used by belonoshko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to map out the mo melting curve up to @xmath11  gpa .",
    "their melting curve , like that of moriarty  @xcite , is consistent with shock data , but disagrees strongly with dac data .",
    "however , even though the simulations employed an implementation of dft that is expected to be accurate , the method used to map the melting curve may still give inaccurate results , as noted by the authors .",
    "their method was to heat the simulated solid at constant volume until the internal energy , pressure , radial distribution function and self - diffusion coefficient showed discontinuities attributable to melting .",
    "this approach gives an upper bound to @xmath4 , but may overestimate it significantly , because of superheating .",
    "the authors estimated that the error in @xmath4 due to superheating should be @xmath12  % , but the arguments for this estimate are indirect .",
    "the present new work on mo melting has several aims .",
    "the first aim is to calculate more accurately the melting curve that follows from the adopted dft exchange - correlation functional @xmath13 .",
    "( we present tests showing that the gga - pbe functional is a good choice . )",
    "it is only by doing this that the possible reasons for the disagreement between theory and experiment can be narrowed down .",
    "we have shown in our recent work on other materials that the errors in computed dft @xmath4 values can be reduced to a few percent , and we have described several techniques for doing this  @xcite . the technique used here is the `` reference coexistence method ''  @xcite .",
    "this requires the accurate fitting of an empirical `` reference '' total energy function to dft m.d .",
    "simulations on the solid and the liquid ; the melting curve of the reference model is then calculated from simulations on large systems consisting of coexisting solid and liquid ; as an essential last step , free - energy corrections for the difference between the reference and dft total - energy functions are used to correct the melting curve . this technique was successfully used in our work on the melting of cu  @xcite , and it has been shown to give results in excellent agreement with an alternative technique , in which dft free energies of the solid and liquid are calculated  @xcite . since it is a ` thermodynamic ' technique relying on equality of gibbs free energies of the two phases , it can not suffer from superheating problems .",
    "a second important aim is to study the differences of atomic and electronic structure of the coexisting solid and liquid , to provide an improved understanding of the factors that determine the melting curve of mo .",
    "the empirical reference model used to determine the dft melting curve has the form of the embedded atom model ( eam )  @xcite .",
    "a useful side benefit of the work is that we obtained a parameterized eam that mimics quite well the dft total - energy function of high-@xmath1 solid and liquid mo .",
    "this model reveals important features of the energetics of mo at high-@xmath5 and high-@xmath1 , and we expect it to be useful in future modelling work on this metal .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief summary of the dft modelling techniques is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : techniques ] , followed by an outline of the reference coexistence technique .",
    "then , sec .",
    "[ sec : tests ] details the rather extensive tests we have performed to ensure that the techniques deliver an accurate description of the energetics and the vibrational and electronic properties of mo .",
    "[ sec : melting ] presents our results for the dft melting curve of mo up to 400  gpa , together with the entropy and volume of fusion as a function of pressure ; our comparison of the atomic and electronic structures of the high-@xmath1 b.c.c .",
    "solid and the liquid is reported at the end of the section .",
    "a discussion of all the results and their relation with previous work is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , followed by our conclusions .",
    "a comprehensive description of dft methods as applied to the modelling of condensed matter is given in recent books  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , there is one and only one uncontrollable approximation in dft , namely the approximation used for the exchange - correlation functional @xmath13 .",
    "there is abundant evidence that commonly used @xmath13 functionals yield accurate results for a range of properties of transition - metal crystals , including equilibrium lattice parameter , elastic constants , phonon frequencies , @xmath14 equation of state , solid - state phase boundaries , etc  @xcite .",
    "dft provides the basis for our present understanding of the electronic structure of transition - metal crystals as a function of pressure .",
    "there is also some evidence that it accurately reproduces the structure of liquid transition metals  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we considered it necessary to test the accuracy of different @xmath13 in the case of mo , as we report in sec .",
    "[ sec : tests ] .    a completely separate issue from the choice of @xmath13 is the _ implementation _ of dft that is used .",
    "this concerns mainly the way that the electron orbitals are represented . for simulations of the high-@xmath1 solid and the liquid , dft molecular dynamics ( m.d . ) must be used , and for this we use the paw ( projector augmented wave ) technique  @xcite , which is generally regarded as the most accurate for m.d .",
    "the paw method developed by blchl  @xcite efficiently combines some of the features originally devised within both linear augmented - plane - wave ( lapw , briefly described below ) and pseudopotential approaches . in paw",
    ", a linear transformation between the all - electron and pseudized wavefunctions is defined in terms of all - electron and pseudized partial waves and a set of projector functions localized on the atoms .",
    "there is a simple formal relationship between paw and the ultra - soft pseudopotential method of vanderbilt  @xcite , and computationally the two approaches are almost equivalent  @xcite .    for m.d .",
    ", we use the method known as born - oppenheimer dynamics , in which the self - consistent ground state is recalculated at each new m.d .",
    "time - step . given the criticisms that are sometimes made of dft work on melting properties  @xcite , is important to be clear that this means the recalculation of the electronic structure of the entire simulated system , so that changes of electronic structure on going from solid to liquid at any degree of compression are fully included .",
    "although paw is well suited to m.d .",
    "simulation , we regard it as essential to check its accuracy against still more accurate implementations of dft , and to do this we have compared with the predictions of the fp - lapw ( full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ) technique , which was developed for high - precision calculations on crystals  @xcite . in this approach , space is divided into spherical regions centred on the ions , and the interstitial space between the spheres .",
    "accurate solution of schrdinger s equation on a radial grid for each angular momentum within each sphere allows both valence and core states to be treated to arbitrarily high precision .",
    "the fp - lapw results to be presented include fully relativistic treatment of the core states and scalar relativistic treatment of the states in valence  @xcite . in fp - lapw calculations on crystalline mo",
    ", we can ensure that they are fully converged with respect to all technical parameters , so that all errors of _ implementation _ are negligible , and the only approximation is that due to @xmath13 itself .",
    "all our paw and fp - lapw calculations were performed using the vasp code  @xcite and the wien2k code  @xcite , respectively .",
    "normally , the aim of dft calculations is to obtain the electronic ground state for given ionic positions .",
    "however , because of the high @xmath1 involved , it is essential in the present work to include thermal electronic excitations , so that for any given ionic positions we must determine the orbitals and occupation numbers that self - consistently minimize the electronic _ free _ energy , using the @xmath15 version of dft originally developed by mermin  @xcite .",
    "we know this is essential , because work on other transition metals  @xcite shows that the electronic specific heat becomes comparable with the vibrational contribution for @xmath16  k. without this , the free energy difference between solid and liquid might be seriously in error .",
    "all our m.d .",
    "simulations are done in the canonical @xmath17 ensemble , with the electronic @xmath1 set equal to the @xmath1 of the ensemble .",
    "values of technical parameters ( @xmath18-point sampling , plane - wave cut - off , etc . )",
    "will be given when we present the calculations .",
    "there are three steps in the reference coexistence technique  @xcite .",
    "first , an empirical reference model is fitted to _",
    "ab initio _ simulations of the solid and the liquid at thermodynamic states close to the expected melting curve .",
    "then , the reference model is used to perform simulations on large systems in which solid and liquid coexist , so as to obtain points on the melting curve of the model .",
    "finally , the differences between the reference and _ ab initio _ total energy functions are used to correct the melting properties of the fitted model so as to obtain the _ ab initio _ melting properties .    in this work ,",
    "we have used the embedded - atom model ( eam )  @xcite as the reference model . the total energy function @xmath19 of this model for a system of @xmath20 atoms has the form : @xmath21^{1/2 } .\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the separation of atoms @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the first term on the right represents an inverse - power repulsive pair potential , while the second ( embedding ) term describes the @xmath25-band bonding .",
    "the model is specified by the characteristic length @xmath26 , the energy scale @xmath27 , the dimensionless coefficient @xmath28 characterizing the strength of the embedding energy , and the embedding and repulsive exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we wish @xmath31 to mimic as closely as possible the _ ab initio _ total energy function @xmath32 , and we achieve this by adjusting the eam parameters .    the method for fitting @xmath19 to @xmath33 is designed so as to minimize the corrections to the melting curve caused by the difference @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore recall the correction scheme before describing the fitting itself . for given @xmath5 and @xmath1 , the difference @xmath35 between the gibbs free energies of the _ ab initio _",
    "liquid and solid deviates from the corresponding difference @xmath36 of the reference liquid and solid , and we write : @xmath37 it is the shift @xmath38 caused by changing the total - energy function from @xmath19 to @xmath33 that causes the shift of melting temperature at given pressure . to first order",
    ", the latter shift is  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the difference between the entropies of liquid and solid ( i.e. the entropy of fusion ) of the reference system , and @xmath41 is @xmath42 evaluated at the melting temperature of the reference system .",
    "the shift @xmath42 is the difference of shifts of gibbs free energies of liquid and solid caused by the shift @xmath34 of total energy function .",
    "we find it convenient to perform our simulations at constant volume and temperature . under these conditions ,",
    "the shift of helmholtz free energy @xmath43 arising from @xmath44 is given by the well - known expansion : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the averages are taken in the reference ensemble . from @xmath43 , we obtain the shift of gibbs free energy at constant pressure as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the isothermal compressibility and @xmath50 is the change of pressure when @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath51 at constant @xmath52 and @xmath1 .    in fitting the eam @xmath19 to the _ ab initio _",
    "@xmath33 so as to minimize the corrections we have just described , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz_exp ] ) and ( [ eq : isocorisobar ] ) that the effects of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath50 all need to be made small .",
    "concerning @xmath55 , we note that addition of a position - independent constant to either @xmath33 or @xmath19 has no effect on the properties of the solid or the liquid , since it simply redefines the energy zero , so that a large value of @xmath53 is not in itself significant .",
    "however , it is crucially important that @xmath53 should have almost the same value in the solid and the liquid , because otherwise there would be a large shift of @xmath42 .",
    "we also seek to make @xmath54 and @xmath50 small in both phases .",
    "to satisfy all these requirements , we perform long _ ab initio _ m.d .",
    "simulations of the solid and the liquid at thermodynamic states near the expected melting curve .",
    "a large number of statistically independent configurations are then drawn from both these runs , so that we get a large set of @xmath33 values for a collection of configurations representative of the solid and the liquid .",
    "our procedure is then to minimize the mean square fluctuations of @xmath44 over this whole set : with @xmath56 the mean value of @xmath44 over the whole set , we minimize @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "note that this @xmath57 is not the same quantity as the @xmath54 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz_exp ] ) , because @xmath57 characterizes the fluctuations of @xmath44 over a set of configurations drawn from both liquid and solid .",
    "minimization of @xmath57 has the effect of reducing simultaneously the difference of @xmath53 between solid and liquid , and of reducing @xmath54 in the two phases . in order to reduce also @xmath59 in the two phases , we add @xmath59 into the quantity to be minimized , with a suitable weight . as will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we find it necessary to refit the eam in this way for different ranges of pressure along the melting curve . a convenient way of characterizing the quality of fit of @xmath19 to @xmath33 is obtained by dividing @xmath57 by the mean square value of the fluctuation of _ ab initio _",
    "energy @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the _ ab initio _ energy averaged over the collection of solid and liquid configurations .",
    "the dimensionless quantity characterizing the fit is then @xmath62^{1/2}$ ] ; the smaller the value of @xmath63 , the better is the fit .    following our previous work  @xcite , our simulations of coexisting solid and liquid with the reference model",
    "are performed in the @xmath64 ensemble . starting with a supercell containing the perfect b.c.c .",
    "crystal , we thermalize it at a temperature slightly below the expected melting temperature . the system remains in the solid state .",
    "the simulation is then halted , and the positions of the atoms in one half of the supercell are held fixed , while the other half is heated to a very high temperature ( typically eight times the expected melting temperature ) , so that it melts completely . with",
    "the fixed atoms still fixed , the molten part is then rethermalized to the expected melting temperature . finally ,",
    "the fixed atoms are released , thermal velocities are assigned , and the whole system is allowed to evolve freely at constant ( @xmath65 ) for a long time ( normally more than 60 ps ) , so that the solid and liquid come into equilibrium .",
    "the system is monitored by calculating the average number of particles in slices of the cell taken parallel to the boundary between the solid and liquid . with this protocol , there is a certain amount of trial and error to find the overall volume that yields the coexisting solid and liquid system .",

    "our main simulations were done on cells containing 6750 atoms , constructed as a @xmath66 b.c.c .",
    "supercell , the long axis being perpendicular to the initial liquid - solid boundary .",
    "we tested the adequacy of this system size by repeating the simulations with larger systems ( around 10000 atoms ) , and found no change in the results .",
    "finally , our best value of the _ ab initio _ melting temperature is obtained by adding to the reference melting temperature the correction @xmath67 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : correctiont ] ) .",
    "the reference entropy of fusion @xmath40 needed in this equation is obtained by performing independent reference m.d .",
    "simulations of the solid and the liquid in the @xmath17 ensemble at the temperatures at which we made the coexistence simulations , using at each of these temperatures the solid and liquid volumes that yield the coexistence pressure .",
    "these simulations give the enthalpy of fusion @xmath68 , from which we obtain @xmath40 from the relation @xmath69 . to obtain the values of @xmath41 needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correctiont ] ) , we again perform reference m.d",
    ". simulations of solid and liquid at the coexistence temperatures and volumes , and calculate @xmath33 for a statistically independent set of configurations drawn from these simulations .",
    "these @xmath33 values must , of course , be fully converged with respect to system size and @xmath70-point sampling .",
    "we find that for a system of 125 atoms and with @xmath33 calculated with a @xmath71 @xmath70-point grid for both solid and liquid , @xmath33 is converged within @xmath72  mev / atom .",
    "these @xmath33 values are then used to compute @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the same calculations yield @xmath50 for solid and liquid , which we use in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isocorisobar ] ) .",
    "to assess the accuracy of the techniques , we have carried out a number of tests on the zero - temperature crystal in the pressure range @xmath73  gpa .",
    "there are three important questions to analyze .",
    "first , we want to test the accuracy of different exchange - correlation functionals compared with experimental data .",
    "second , we aim to study the effect on paw results of including different electronic states in the valence set .",
    "third , fp - lapw calculations are performed to assess errors incurred by the paw approximation .",
    "in addition , we have done tests to demonstrate that paw correctly reproduces the changes of electronic structure with pressure given by the fp - lapw method .",
    "tests of phonon frequencies are also carried out , because of their relevance to the vibrational free energy of the system .      at very high pressures , states that would normally be treated as core states may respond significantly to compression . in the case of mo ,",
    "the @xmath74 states lie only @xmath75  ev below the fermi energy @xmath76 and we always include them in the valence set .",
    "the @xmath77 states lie considerably deeper at @xmath78  ev below @xmath76 , and we have examined the effect of including them .",

    "our fp - lapw calculations include fully relativistic effects of the core states and scalar relativistic treatment of the states in valence  @xcite , and the tolerances are chosen so as to ensure energy convergence to better than 1  mev / atom  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wien2kvasp ] , the fp - lapw @xmath88 results are almost indistinguishable from the paw results over the entire pressure range of interest , with both lda and gga functionals .",
    "this provides valuable confirmation of the accuracy of the paw technique , on which all our present calculations of melting properties are based . out of interest",
    ", we also performed fp - lapw calculations using the recently developed wu - cohen form of gga  @xcite , which has been reported to give improved predictions of condensed - matter properties .",
    "this functional satisfies the same constraints used to construct the pbe functional , but the enhancement factor entering the exchange energy density is chosen to match closely the gradient expansion of svendsen and von barth  @xcite for systems having a slowly varying density .",
    "for this reason , this functional is expected to perform well for solids but not so well for atoms or molecules , where the variation of the valence electron density is generally larger .",
    "we find that this functional is in much better agreement with the experimental @xmath88 data than either lda or gga(pbe ) .",
    "unfortunately , at the time most of the present work was done , we had no way of performing wu - cohen calculations within paw , so we were unable to do melting calculations with this new functional .",
    "the electronic structure of transition metals has been intensively studied , and changes of electronic structure with increasing pressure have been thoroughly investigated both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the energetics of these metals is , of course , strongly dominated by the d - bands , but the s - p bands also play an important role .",
    "an effect that has been well recognised for many years is the pressure induced upward shift of the s - p band relative to the d band , caused by the greater spatial extent of the s - p orbitals  @xcite .",
    "this relative shift means that increasing pressure causes a transfer of electrons from s - p to d bands , resulting in an increase of occupancy of the latter .",
    "it has been proposed recently  @xcite that the large differences between theoretical predictions of melting curves and the results of static compression experiments for some transition metals may be due to an incorrect treatment of s - p  @xmath89  d transfer in the dft - based simulations . in order to demonstrate that our paw calculations reproduce the electronic structure",
    "as given by the most accurate dft methods , we have made detailed comparisons of the electronic density of states ( dos ) calculated with paw and fp - lapw over the pressure range @xmath73  gpa .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : doswien2kvasp ] the electronic dos from fp - lapw and paw calculated at 0 , 150 and 300  gpa , using the gga(pbe ) functional .",
    "we note the essentially perfect agreement between the two methods . at all pressures , the dos",
    "consists of two separate parts : a narrow peak at about 35  ev below the fermi energy , corresponding to 4p states , and a much broader distribution consisting of the multiple peaks due to the 4d bands superimposed on the slowly varying dos of the s - p bands .",
    "we note the characteristic feature of b.c.c .",
    "transition metals that the fermi energy falls in a deep minimum in the d - band dos .",
    "as expected , the widths of the 4p and 4d parts of the dos broaden markedly with increasing pressure .",
    "the pressure induced relative shift of s - p and d bands can not be clearly seen from the dos itself .",
    "however , it is very clear from the band structure , shown at pressures of 0 and @xmath90  gpa in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure ] .",
    "the state lying @xmath91  ev below the fermi energy is the bottom of the s - p band , which lies well below the d states at zero pressure , but well above the lowest d states at @xmath92  gpa .",
    "we have checked that this relative shift is precisely reproduced by the paw calculations .",
    "this leaves little doubt that the paw techniques , on which all our melting calculations are based , correctly reproduce this important feature of the pressure dependent electronic structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : melting ] , we will present results on the temperature dependence of the electronic dos in the solid and the liquid .",
    "the calculation of phonon frequencies is an important test of dft approximations , because of the detailed comparisons with experimental data that can be made .",
    "it is particularly important in the context of melting calculations , because , for the harmonic solid , errors in phonon frequencies translate directly into free energy errors , which are linked with errors in melting temperature .",
    "we present here our calculations of the phonon dispersion relations of mo at its experimental volume , using paw with gga(pbe ) exchange - correlation .",
    "the technique for calculating the phonon frequencies is the small displacement method , as implemented in our phon code  @xcite , which we used in earlier work on fe , al and cu . in this method ,",
    "the elements of the force - constant matrix are obtained by displacing atoms from the perfect - lattice positions and computing by dft the forces on all the atoms . for a b.c.c .",
    "crystal , it suffices to displace a single atom along the ( 111 ) direction .",
    "since all the calculations employ periodic boundary conditions , the displaced atom is at the centre of a periodically repeated supercell . to obtain accurate dispersion relations over the whole brillouin zone",
    ", this supercell must be large enough so that the elements of the force - constant matrix have negligible values at its boundaries .",
    "in addition , the calculation of the forces must be converged with respect to electronic @xmath70-point sampling , and to enhance this convergence we employ fermi smearing .",

    ", the phonon frequencies must be converged with respect to atom displacement , supercell size , @xmath70-point sampling and fermi smearing . rather than insisting that every single frequency be converged , it is more convenient to require that the geometric mean frequency @xmath93 be converged .",

    "the origin of this sharp dip in the phonon dispersion curve of mo at point h has been related to the nesting of electronic states near the fermi level  @xcite ( see figures in sec .  [",
