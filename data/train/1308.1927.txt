    "confined liquid crystals have received considerable experimental and theoretical attention over the past decades due to their fundamental and technological importance .",
    "liquid crystals are in contact with surfaces in many devices such as liquid - crystal ( lc ) displays , optical shutters and lc thermometers . in these systems",
    "it is very important to know the effect of geometrical confinement , surface roughness and particle - surface interactions on the ordering properties of lc materials @xcite .",
    "flat and curved surfaces , confinement between parallel surfaces , tubular pores , nanochannels and porous materials are just a few examples where the phase behaviour of the lcs is modified @xcite .",
    "several phenomena have been observed in confined lcs such as surface phase transitions @xcite , capillary nematization @xcite , layering transitions @xcite and suppression of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "in addition to calamitic lcs , the ordering properties of discotic lcs have also been examined in the presence of different confinements @xcite .",
    "even binary mixtures of plates and rods have been studied at a single wall and in a slit pore @xcite .",
    "the objective of our work is to examine the effect of the cylindrical confinement on the phase behaviour and structural properties of parallel hard cylinders , assuming that the cylinders are parallel to the surface of the pore ( planar anchoring ) with their axes pointing along the cylinder axis .",
    "it has been found that a bulk system of parallel hard cylinders has three different phases , namely , nematic , smectic a and solid @xcite .",
    "here we focus only on the nematic and smectic a ( hereafter called simply ` smectic ' ) phases , while the solid phase is left for future studies .",
    "we use the well - known onsager second virial theory @xcite which gives reasonable results for the nematic and smectic phases of parallel hard rods @xcite . in our previous work",
    "we have shown that onsager theory can be applied successfully to study the nematic and smectic ordering of homeotropically anchored uniaxial and biaxial hard rods in slit - like pores @xcite . in particular , we showed @xcite that the nematic - smectic transition is suppressed due to the restricted geometry along the direction of the density modulation . in the present work we change our focus to the cylindrical confinement and consider planar anchoring .",
    "this system behaves very differently from the slit - like pore : since the cylinder is infinite in the direction of the smectic density wave , there are no geometric restrictions and the nematic - smectic phase transition can survive in the cylindrical pore .",
    "our study reveals that planar anchoring widens the stability window of the nematic phase and shrinks the region of smectic ordering in cylindrical pores .",
    "the case of hometropic anchoring in cylindrical geometry involves topological restrictions that give rise to defects and is not considered here .",
    "we study the phase behaviour of a system of parallel hard cylinders confined in a cylindrical hard pore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the molecular parameters are the length ( @xmath1 ) and the diameter ( @xmath0 ) of the cylinder . the particle orientations are taken to be parallel to the cylindrical pore , which is infinitely long but has a finite size in the perpendicular plane .",
    "note that the width of the pore ( @xmath2 ) must be larger than @xmath0 .",
    "the appropriate thermodynamic function for studying confined fluids is the grand - potential density functional @xmath7 $ ] [ 26 ] , which is given by @xmath8=\\beta { \\cal f}[\\rho]-\\int_v d{\\bm r}\\rho({\\bm r})\\left[\\beta\\mu-\\beta v_{\\hbox{\\tiny ext}}({\\bm r})\\right ] , \\label{f1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath11 is temperature , @xmath12 is the helmholtz free - energy functional , @xmath13 is the volume of the pore , @xmath14 is the position vector of the rod , @xmath15 is the local number density , and @xmath16 is the chemical potential .",

    "let @xmath17 be the cylindrical coordinates of a position vector @xmath14 .",
    "the external potential due to the confinement , @xmath18 , is considered to be hard , i.e. the surfaces of the cylinders have to be inside the pore .",
    "it takes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the effective pore radius .",

    "( [ int ] ) ( and in fact all integrals in the present calculation ) are also computed using a trapezoidal rule . in the nematic phase the local density depends only on @xmath32 , and @xmath55 , \\label{f9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the smectic order parameter is zero for any solution @xmath56 without @xmath33 dependence , while it has a positive value for a smectic - like solution @xmath34 .",
    "we use the particle length @xmath1 as a scaling parameter for the smectic period , @xmath57 , and the @xmath33 coordinate , @xmath58 .",
    "the other scaling parameter is the particle diameter , @xmath0 , which we use to make @xmath32 and @xmath2 dimensionless : @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the next section we present the nematic and smectic density profiles obtained from eqns .",
    "( [ f6 ] ) and ( [ f9 ] ) and determine the phase boundary of the nematic - smectic phase transition .",
    "in very narrow pores ( 1@xmath61 ) , there is no room for particles to overtake each other , and only nearest - neighbour interaction along @xmath33 occurs .",
    "the phase behaviour of the confined hard cylinders becomes identical to that of the one - dimensional tonks gas @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that such a system does not exhibit a thermodynamic phase transition from fluid to crystal structures ( note however that a very dense tonks gas shows some changes from a fluid- to a solid - like structure , in the sense that the distance between the peaks of the positional distribution function is close to the average distance between neighboring particles ; see the review of giaquinta @xcite ) .",
    "the present approximate theory does predict a continuous fluid - crystal transition ( the one - dimensional ` crystal ' corresponding to the smectic ) at unrealistically high densities .",
    "therefore one has to be cautious with the predictions of onsager second - virial theory for high densities in very narrow pores .    in the nematic",
    "fluid the density profile is homogeneous for @xmath62 because in this case @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "the density profile derived from eqn .",
    "( [ f9 ] ) is @xmath64 which can be solved numerically for a given value of @xmath65 .",
    "this result is a consequence of the fact that the excluded volume of the particles , @xmath66 is always the same regardless of the location of the rod ( either in the middle or at the wall of the pore ) .",
    "this situation changes for @xmath67 , because more than one cylinder may fit into the pore in the same layer , i.e. overtaking can take place .",
    "the density profiles coming from the numerical solution of eqn .",
    "( [ f9 ] ) for @xmath68 are presented in fig .",
    "one can see that the density profile changes continuously from a homogeneous to an inhomogeneous distribution with increasing pore width .",
    "the reason why the density is constant in a small interval of radial distances from the pore centre for the case @xmath69 is that particles staying in this region have the highest excluded volume and do not allow any particle to overtake them . at the same time , the density peak at the wall is due to the fact that particles can reach minimal excluded volume at the wall , which makes it possible to maximize the free volume available for the rest of the particles .",
    "this manifests very clearly at @xmath70 , where the fluid becomes completely inhomogeneous .",
    "the structure of the fluid phase becomes even more interesting for wider pores , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the decreasing effect in excluded volume of the wall - particle interaction",
    "gives rise to oscillatory behaviour in the density profile .",
    "for @xmath71 the strong adsorption tendency of the particles at the wall results in a depletion zone between the wall and the pore central region , while the density peak at the centre and that at the wall are comparable . the propagation of the oscillatory behaviour to a wider range of distances can be observed with increasing density at @xmath72 .",
    "for this pore width , the competition between wall - particle and particle - particle excluded - volume interactions results in a density minimum at the centre of the pore .",
    "the case @xmath73 demonstrates that the effect of the wall decays exponentially from the wall to the pore centre , with a typical decaying length not exceeding @xmath74 from the wall even at very high average packing fractions .",
    "therefore the structure of a hard - cylinder fluid in very wide pores is altered only in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "the bulk system of parallel hard cylinders undergoes a continuous nematic - smectic phase transition .",
    "the nematic is a homogeneous fluid phase , while the smectic phase has a layered structure in the direction of the long axis of the cylinder ( one - dimensional solid ) .",
    "the equations for the transition density @xmath75 and smectic period @xmath76 of the bulk nematic - smectic transition are given by @xcite @xmath77&=&0 \\label{f11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the smectic wave number at the transition .",
    "these equations are obeyed by the values @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the critical packing fraction . to determine the locus of the nematic - smectic transition points in the confined system , we add a smectic modulation to the fluid density as @xmath82 , \\label{f12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the solution of eqn .",
    "( [ f9 ] ) for a given @xmath65 and @xmath84 measures the amplitude of a small density modulation .",
    "after substitution of eqn .",
    "( [ f12 ] ) into eqn .",
    "( [ f6 ] ) and linearization in @xmath84 of the exponential function , we obtain the following equation for @xmath84 : @xmath85 note that eqn .",
    "( [ f13 ] ) reduces to the first of eqns .",
    "( [ f11 ] ) in the limit @xmath86 , where the local density and @xmath84 become constant .",
    "the case of very narrow pores ( @xmath62 ) is very similar to the bulk case , because it is possible to simplify eqn .",
    "( [ f13 ] ) to @xmath87 where @xmath88 satisfies eqn .",
    "( [ f10 ] ) .",
    "comparison of the first of eqns .",
    "( [ f11 ] ) and ( [ f14 ] ) shows that @xmath89 . to numerically determine @xmath88 and @xmath90 for other cases where @xmath2 is larger , it is useful to rewrite eqn .",
    "( [ f13 ] ) in discretised form , using the same space grid in radial direction @xmath32 introduced before : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the elements of a matrix @xmath93 : @xmath94 here @xmath95 are weights and roots for the trapezoidal - rule integration [ note that the @xmath96 roots take account of the restricted integration interval in eqn .",
    "( [ f13 ] ) , and give an @xmath93 matrix which is band - diagonal ] . at the nematic - smectic transition",
    ", the @xmath97 matrix must obey the following two equations : @xmath98 which provide the transition density @xmath99 and period @xmath100 .",
    "the dimension of the @xmath97 matrix depends on the values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "for all the cases studied , with the chosen values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the number of points used result in accurate values for density and period .    one interesting outcome of eqns .",
    "( [ f16 ] ) is that the smectic period @xmath100 does not depend on the pore - width and is always equal to the bulk value , @xmath103 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath32 and @xmath33 variables are decoupled in the mayer function .",
    "however , as far as the transition density is concerned , there must be a dependence with pore width : in the bulk limit ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath99 should go to the bulk value @xmath104 , while it should diverge when @xmath105 ( note that , as mentioned in the beginning of section [ results_a ] in connection with the isomorphism between the present model and tonks gas , there should be no transition for @xmath106 and , as a consequence , the transition density should in fact diverge as @xmath107 ) .",
    "therefore , the smectic phase should be destabilized with respect to the nematic phase with decreasing pore width .",
    "the results of eqn .",
    "( [ f16 ] ) confirm this prediction .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the destabilization of the smectic phase is weak for very wide pores , while in narrow pores it gets very strong as the contribution of the wall - particle excluded volume becomes comparable to that due to particle - particle excluded volume .",
    "this effect , although qualitatively correct , might be grossly overestimated by the present theory .",
    "for example , for @xmath108 , the increase in transition density exceeds the bulk value by 50% ( note that the resulting density is quite close to the close - packing limit of hard cylinders while it is known from mc simulations of hard cylinders @xcite that there is a large gap between the bulk nematic - smectic transition and the close - packing densities ) .",
    "therefore it is clear that the predictions of our theory are correct but not quantitatively reliable for relatively narrow pores .",
    "it is interesting to note the presence of damped oscillations in the nematic - smectic transition curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this behavior is related to the commensuration between pore width and typical transverse particle distance when the former is changed .",
    "the density profiles along the nematic - smectic boundary shows very strong adsorption at the wall and depletion zones are also present at all pore widths .",
    "the structure in the pore centre is strongly affected by the pore diameter in narrow pores , since the structure generated at the surfaces may interfere coherently or incoherently in the central region .",
    "by contrast , in wide pores the density modulation does not reach the pore centre and rapidly decays to an almost constant value ( even at the nematic - smectic phase boundary ) , the inhomogeneous density being restricted to a region of thickness @xmath109 from the wall ( see the inset of @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the variation of the density profile of the smectic phase along the pore symmetry axis ( with the value of the chemical potential chosen in the bulk smectic region ) .",
    "the upper curve shows the local density at the wall , @xmath110 , while the lower curve corresponds to the local density at the centre , @xmath111 .",
    "note the smooth density modulations along the direction normal to the layers in both narrow and wide pores . in both cases",
    "the interstitial region ( @xmath112 ) is not empty as the density is substantial even in the middle of the pore , i.e. the one - dimensional ordering is not strong along the layer normal .",
    "the average density profile along the pore axis ( dashed curve ) shows that the wall - particle excluded volume effect is very strong in a narrow pore , while it is marginal in a wide pore .",
    "this can be seen very clearly in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the average density profile is just slightly different from the density profile in the pore centre .",
    "it can be also seen that the coupling in the ordering between normal and in - plane directions is weak in both cases .",
    "the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] show that the smectic order parameter goes smoothly to zero with decreasing packing fraction , i.e. the nematic - smectic phase transition is continuous even in cylindrical confinement .",
    "we have studied the effect of cylindrical confinement on the nematic and smectic phases of parallel hard rods using onsager s second - virial theory .",
    "we found that the wall - rod interaction gives rise to inhomogeneous nematic and smectic structures , with strong adsorption taking place at the wall .",
    "the inhomogeneous packing of the rods gives rise to a decrease in the average excluded volume of a particle , i.e. the free volume available for the particles in the pore can be increased substantially .",
    "in addition to this , the stability region of the smectic phase is shifted to higher densities with decreasing pore width . the observed nematic - smectic phase transition is continuous for any pore size .",
    "the reason for the destabilization of the smectic phase is that adding a one - dimensional spatial ordering to the inhomogeneous nematic phase can not increase the packing entropy to the same extent as in the homogenous nematic phase .",
    "the transversal ( in - plane ) positional order is always present , while the longitudinal ( out - of - plane ) order takes place just above a critical density . in such a situation ,",
    "the excluded volume gain from the longitudinal order can not be as high as in the bulk nematic phase .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in a fluid of gay - berne particles @xcite , the cylindrical confinement also hinders the formation of the smectic phase .",
    "although qualitatively correct , the predictions of this theory may be in error for narrow pores . a way to improve the predictions",
    "( but certainly not the essential physics ) is to use a parsons - lee scheme @xcite , where the high - density terms of the diagrammatic expansion of the free - energy functional are approximated by those of a scaled fluid of hard spheres and the resulting series is resummed to give a density - renormalised free energy",
    ". this extended theory will , in the limit of small pore widths , give lower ( and more realistic ) values for the average packing fractions than those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "we have not examined the stability of possible columnar and solid - like structures of the confined hard cylinders .",
    "the stabilization of columnar ordering is quite unrealistic because it does not exist in the bulk limit and the commensuration conflict between pore - size and particle diameter does not support the formation of packed two - dimensional lattices in the pore .",
    "however , the stabilization of columnar ordering can not be excluded at some special pore widths , where the accommodation of the cylinders can be achieved efficiently in the pore . in very narrow pores ,",
    "the existence of the nematic - smectic phase boundary is quite questionable and it may happen that a inhomogeneous nematic structure change continuously to a solid - like structure .",
    "the structure of such closely - packed phases may vary greatly with pore width , as is the case in cylindrically confined hard spheres @xcite .",
    "our results clearly show that the nematic phase is the winner in the cylindrical confinement of parallel particles .",
    "as regards the freely rotating case , we can say that the stability window of the nematic phase is expected to be even wider because confinement enhances the orientational ordering of hard rods @xcite .",
    "therefore our study should be extended to the system of freely rotating hard rods in order to get a deeper understanding of the delicate interplay between the wall - rod and rod - rod interactions on the stability of isotropic , nematic , smectic and closed - packed structures .",
