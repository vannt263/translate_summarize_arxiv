    "under the current paradigm of galaxy formation galaxies build via a hierarchical process and our galaxy is deemed no exception .",
    "relics of formation are observed as spatial and kinematic substructures in the galaxy s stellar halo .",
    "recent observations such as those from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have brought a large increase in the detections of substructures within the outer reaches of the halo ( out to @xmath8 kpc ) .",
    "these streams have usually been detected as spatial overdensities from photometry e.g. , @xcite .",
    "many of these structures have been identified as belonging to the debris of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) , which traces the polar orbit of this galaxy as it merges with the milky way .",
    "furthermore , after subtracting such prominent substructures @xcite observed a dominant fraction of the halo to deviate from a smooth distribution , consistent with being primarily accretion debris .",
    "closer to the sun the spatial coherence of streams and substructures is not so easily discernible and most streams of stars are visible only as velocity structures , such as the @xcite stream .",
    "indeed , @xcite has shown that only at distances greater than @xmath9 do we expect that the structures associated with tidal debris to be observable as spatial overdensities . therefore , if we wish to identify and study structures within the inner reaches of the halo - where they are most accessible for high resolution follow - up observations - we must search utilizing kinematic data .",
    "kinematic surveys of the solar neighbourhood are therefore ideal to detect substructures in the nearby regions of the galaxy s halo . rave ( radial velocity experiment ) is an ambitious program to conduct a 17,000 square degree survey measuring line - of - sight velocities , stellar parameters , metallicities and abundance ratios of up to 1 million stars @xcite .",
    "rave utilizes the wide field ( @xmath10 deg@xmath11 ) multi - object spectrograph 6df instrument on the 1.2-m uk schmidt telescope of the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) .",
    "rave s input catalogue for the most part , @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "this region is not discussed in this paper however . ]",
    "has only a magnitude selection criterion of @xmath14 , thus creating a sample with no kinematic biases .",
    "the observations are in the ca - triplet spectral region at 840 nm to 875 nm with an effective resolution of @xmath15 . starting in april 2003 ,",
    "at the end of 2009 rave had collected more than 400,000 spectra .",
    "rave s radial velocities are accurate to @xmath16 when compared to external measurements , while the repeat observations exhibit an accuracy of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "these highly accurate radial velocities make rave ideal to search for kinematic substructures in an extended region around the sun . indeed , with rave we now move away from studying the _ solar neighbourhood _ ( e.g. @xcite : @xmath18 ) to examining the _ solar suburb _ ( @xmath19 ) .    using rave s highly accurate radial velocities",
    ", we have discovered a stream that lies mostly within the constellation of aquarius at a distance of @xmath0 , in the direction @xmath20 and at @xmath21 .",
    "the velocity places the stream as part of the galaxy s halo . as it lies in the direction of the constellation of aquarius",
    "we have named it the aquarius stream .",
    "the detection of this stream is described in section [ sec : stream ] . in section [ sec : bes ] we compare the rave data to mock data from the besanon galaxy mode and the newly - developed galaxy modelling code galaxia , which offers a number of significant advantages . using these models",
    "we determine the significance of the detection and constrain its localization . in section [ sec : pop ] we use rave s stellar parameters combined with 2mass ( @xmath22 ) photometry to infer basic properties of the stream population and derive distance estimates .",
    "we also use reduced proper motions to obtain another estimate of the distances .",
    "the stream appears to be highly localized on the sky which is interesting considering the apparent proximity of the stream . in section",
    "[ sec : pos ] we explore possible connections of the aquarius stream to other known spatial and kinematic streams , finding that it is not linked to any previously reported structure . in section [ sec : nat ] we investigate possible connections to other ( marginal ) over - densities in the rave dataset , and conclude that the stream is unlikely to be associated with any of them .",
    "a simple model of the recent disruption of a satellite in the galaxy s potential is able to account for the observed localization .",
    "the aquarius stream thus is a new and nearby enigma in the milky way s halo .",
    "rave measures the velocities of stars that are selected purely on the basis of their photometry , so it is free of kinematic biases .",
    "over most of the sky the probability of a star s selection depends entirely on its apparent magnitude ; only in directions towards the galactic centre is selection based on colour as well as magnitude ( dr1 : @xcite , dr2 : @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , rave s radial velocities are accurate to @xmath23 so fine substructures are best detected using radial velocities alone : combining them with proper motions and distances mean a significant loss of accuracy .",
    "the aquarius stream was discovered in rave data as a structure seen in heliocentric radial velocity vs galactic latitude / longitude space .",
    "when the stream was first noted , it was found to be most clearly defined by faint stars with low gravities , which suggests that the structure is at some distance from the sun .",
    "removing foreground giants enhances its visibility .",
    "we use the internal release of rave from january 2010 that contains 332,747 rvs of 252,790 individual stars .",
    "we use only those observations for which the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath24 and the tonry and davis cross - correlation coefficient @xmath25 to remove potentially erroneous observations .",
    "note that , since not all observations have the more accurate signal - to - noise estimation , @xmath26 , we use the @xmath27 value which can underestimate the signal - to - noise ( see dr2 ) . for multiple observations of single stars",
    "the @xmath28 were averaged , as were the stellar parameters for those observations that yielded an estimate of these parameters .",
    "the aquarius stream was found in the galactic latitude slice @xmath29 .",
    "as described above , it is also more marked for fainter stars .",
    "we therefore introduce an upper brightness limit to enhance the visibility of the stream .",
    "as noted in the first and second data release papers , a subset of the rave input catalog have @xmath30 magnitudes from the supercosmos sky survey @xcite , which show an offset to denis @xmath30 magnitudes .",
    "not all rave stars have denis @xmath30 magnitudes either .",
    "we therefore turned to 2mass bands for our magnitude limit , even though this tends to bias against cool stars in our sample , and we potentially miss some candidates .",
    "we found that a limit of @xmath31 produced the best differentiation of the stream from the background population , removing the brighter , nearby giants .",
    "figure [ f1]a shows the structure seen in heliocentric radial velocity , @xmath28 , against galactic longitude , @xmath32 , for the stars with the selection criteria @xmath29 , @xmath31 . a clear structure begins at @xmath33 at @xmath34 and extends down to @xmath21 at @xmath35 .",
    "this overdensity is particularly clear in figure [ f1]b , where we plot the histogram for @xmath28 in the region @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath36 .",
    "the stream can be seen as an excess of stars at negative velocities that is distinct from the general population .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      we have calculated orbits for candidate stars in the potential of helmi et al ( 2006 ) , which has contributions from a disk , bulge , and dark halo .",
    "table [ tab4 ] gives averages for various quantities derived from these orbits as well as the median quantities for the overall kinematics , using both sets of distances .",
    "note that we chose the median as it gives more consistent results , and for this reason we also excluded the two most distant stars with @xmath37 kpc as their kinematics differed greatly from the others .",
    "also , the values for the pericentre and apocentre only include non - radial orbits .",
    "figure [ f6 ] shows the @xmath38-@xmath39 and @xmath38-energy ( lindblad ) planes for orbits based on both distance estimates , where to aid comparison to other studies we use here energies as calculated in @xcite .",
    "note that the scatter of the isochrone distance results is large so the majority of these points lie off the plot , as do some of the rpm distance results .",
    "we plot for reference stars in the geneva copenhagen survey @xcite , which is comprised mainly of thin and some thick disk stars .",
    "the circular orbit loci for this potential are also shown in the lindblad diagram . to show the typical error covariance we also ran a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation for each star ( with the rpm distances ) . from the errors in distances ,",
    "proper motion and radial velocity we generated a sample of 1000 points representative of each distribution , which were then propagated through into the momenta and energy .",
    "following @xcite , in figure [ f6 ] we plot the resulting distributions within @xmath40 of each of the average values .",
    "these demonstrate the large non - gaussian errors and covariances in @xmath41 , energy : the aquarius stream could not be found initially in these planes .",
    "indeed , all three values are quite ill - constrained with the current uncertainties in the stellar distances .",
    "nevertheless , we can at least say that the stars are retrograde and that they are away from the notable halo feature of @xcite at ( @xmath42 . the aquarius stream is also not near the prograde and retrograde features of @xcite at ( @xmath43 and ( @xmath44 . also , with values of @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 it is not one of the newly detected solar neighbourhood streams listed in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "another solar neighbourhood stream is the kapteyn group , which @xcite suggests is stripped from @xmath52 centauri ( also see @xcite ) , which in turn is thought to be the surviving nucleus of an ancient dwarf galaxy @xcite . @xcite",
    "employ the same potential as we do here , finding @xmath53 for @xmath52 cen and @xmath54 for the kapteyn group .",
    "the aquarius stream is somewhat similar to the distribution in @xmath38-energy for the kapteyn group/@xmath52 cen .",
    "however , in section [ subsec : progenitor ] we will see that our model for the stream rules against an association .",
    "another significant halo clumping found by @xcite towards the north galactic pole has a retrograde orbit with @xmath55 , which is consistent with that of aquarius .",
    "the mean @xmath56 for this moving group of @xmath57 is rather high when compared to ( @xmath58 for aquarius , as well as the @xmath59 values in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "moreover , our model for the aquarius stream in section [ subsec : progenitor ] does not overlap with the north galactic pole , again ruling against an association .",
    "the distances calculated for aquarius stream stars place it fairly close to the sun",
    ". if they are of the correct order of magnitude then we could possibly expect additional stream members in other areas of the sky . however , our exploration of the two bounding latitude ranges in section [ subsec : loc ] yielded no striking overdensities that we can immediately associate with the aquarius stream .",
    "two other regions had overdensities detected for @xmath31 , though they are not as conspicuous as aquarius : the region around @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( region a ) and the region @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( region b ) . to establish if these additional areas could be associated with the aquarius stream , and if not , how the stream s localization arises , we created a simple model of a satellite dissolving in the potential of the galaxy .      to generate a simple satellite dissolution , we first chose one of the average , stable orbits  that using @xmath64 for the star c2322499 - 135351  and integrated the orbit back in time .",
    "centering on the orbital positions at various times in the past , @xmath65 , we generated @xmath66 test particles from a gaussian sphere with core radius and internal velocity dispersion @xmath67 pc , @xmath68 .",
    "neglecting self - gravity we then integrated the orbits of the satellite forward in time until the present day .",
    "this approximate approach suffices as our aim here is illustrative rather than finding the definitive orbit for the aquarius stream .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows the distribution of particles for two different starting times : one starting two orbital periods ago , @xmath69 , and another starting at @xmath70 .",
    "these were selected to illustrate two different extremes , one in which the stream at the present day has yet to be significantly phase mixed and the other when it is completely phase mixed . in both scenarios",
    "the aquarius stream stars sample a volume near the apocenter of the orbits .",
    "the furthermost stars have @xmath71 values that are substantially larger than @xmath72 kpc for the dissolving satellite , a discrepancy that may be resolved either by a more detailed model or by more accurate distances . in general",
    ", however the majority of aquarius ( and rave ) stars are within a few kpc of the sun , and only a small portion of the total volume traced by the orbits falls within this sample volume .    in figure [ f8 ]",
    "we plot @xmath32-@xmath73 and @xmath32-@xmath28 planes for test particles within @xmath74 kpc of the sun for the simulations with the two different starting times , where we chose this distance limit as it encompasses @xmath75 of the aquarius stars .",
    "we also plot the aquarius candidates and the stars that fall within regions a and b , as well as the background population of rave stars .",
    "the distribution of particles for the simulation with @xmath69 occupy a small region in @xmath32-@xmath73-@xmath28 that does not coincide with the locations of regions a and b. furthermore , the distribution in @xmath32-@xmath28 remarkably mimics that of the aquarius stream and a picture emerges of how the stream can be so localized : with the rave survey data we miss portions of the stream due to the location of the survey boundary in some regions and in others , because @xmath28 overlaps with that of the main distribution so the stream is difficult to detect .    in the phase - mixed ( @xmath70 ) scenario",
    "we see that there is overlap between the region in @xmath32-@xmath73 plane occupied by the test particles and for regions a and b , though the @xmath28 values for region b agree better with those of the test particles than region a. however , it would be difficult to associate both regions a and b with aquarius without others regions being populated .",
    "in particular , we could expect overdensities at @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 as well as a population at @xmath79 , @xmath80 out to @xmath21 .",
    "such overdensities are not observed in the data .",
    "these simple models of a dissolving satellite therefore suggest that the localization of aquarius is due to further regions of phase - space not yet being populated : the region in ( @xmath81 ) space occupied by the @xmath69 simulation is more consistent with the observed population than that of the @xmath82 simulation .",
    "this suggests that the stream is most likely dynamically young , resulting from a recent disruption of a progenitor , and has not yet undergone phase mixing .",
    "indeed , our simple model of a recently disrupted satellite is very successful in reproducing the main features of the aquarius stream . in table",
    "[ tab4 ] we therefore list the parameters found for test particles from this model in the aquarius stream s latitude range .",
    "these are quite similar to those found using the @xmath83 and @xmath64 .",
    "the results also corroborate our observation from the rpmd in section [ sec : rpm ] that the stream stars have a constant transverse velocity , a fact which was used in in section [ sec : rpmdist ] to derive @xmath64 .",
    "test particles for the @xmath69 simulation within the aquarius stream latitude range and distance range , i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath74 kpc have @xmath84 .",
    "this agrees with the value of @xmath85 found from the rpmd .    from figure [ f8 ]",
    "we see that the recent - disruption model suggests that at @xmath86 we can expect a smaller population of stars associated with the aquarius stream out to @xmath87 .",
    "this begins to overlap at @xmath88 with the rave survey area , though we do not detect such a population in the data .",
    "future releases of rave data with more observations in this area , combined with more careful modelling of the stream , will enable a better understanding of whether this area is indeed populated by aquarius stream stars .",
    "the above scenario of a dynamically young stream is not inconsistent with an age of @xmath6 for the aquarius candidates , as estimated from the isochrone fit in section [ subsec : mdfcmd ] : the stream can be seen as a remnant of an old satellite that has been recently disrupted . as to the nature of the progenitor of the aquarius stream",
    ", it could either be a dwarf galaxy or a globular cluster .",
    "the survival of this progenitor would depend on its concentration : it could either have been tidally stripped or have undergone complete disruption .    to search for possible globular clusters that the aquarius stream could have been tidally stripped from ,",
    "we performed a search of the @xcite catalog of known globular clusters , selecting those with @xmath89}<-0.5 $ ] , @xmath90 kpc and @xmath91 kpc , where the latter limits are taken from the model satellite orbit in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "we then compared the distribution of the clusters in @xmath92 to that of the model satellite stream ( @xmath69 ) , and found no globular clusters that match the simulation .",
    "also , @xmath52 cen , with an @xmath81 of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , is not consistent with not - yet - phased - mixed scenario in figure [ f8 ] and table [ tab4 ] . with our uncalibrated metallicities",
    "it is difficult to compare the mdf to that of @xmath52 cen .",
    "a high - resolution spectroscopic abundance study , such in @xcite , is required ( as well as further modelling of aquarius ) to definitively understand if aquarius is related to @xmath52 cen .",
    "the progenitor of the aquarius stream therefore is currently unknown .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of a new halo stream found as an overdensity of stars with large heliocentric radial velocities in the rave data - set .",
    "the detection is enabled by rave s selection criteria creating no kinematic biases .",
    "the fifteen member stars detected have @xmath95 and lie between @xmath2 , @xmath96 in the constellation of aquarius .",
    "we established the statistical significance of the stream by comparing the rave data , in the galactic latitude range @xmath29 , to equivalent mock samples of stars created using the besanon galaxy model and the code galaxia .",
    "for different cell sizes , @xmath97 , we compared the number of stars in the data and models , finding that for the majority of cell sizes the region around the aquarius stream exhibited a @xmath98 overdensity in the data , irrespective of the dust modelling .",
    "searching for additional overdensities in neighboring latitude regions yields no structures of the same level of significance ( other than the lmc ) , though two regions are identified as being marginally overdense .    for most of the aquarius stars",
    "rave stellar parameter estimates are also available .",
    "the member stars are metal - poor with @xmath7}}=-1\\pm 0.4 $ ] and we derive a preliminary isochrone fit in the @xmath5-@xmath4 plane with an population age of @xmath6 . both the @xmath28 and metallicity are consistent with the group being within the stellar halo .",
    "we further use a reduced proper motion diagram to derive the transverse velocity for the stream , finding @xmath99 for the group .",
    "this again places it within the galaxy s halo .",
    "we use the isochrone fits and the rpmd to provide distance estimates to the stars , where we prefer the latter as they give more consistent kinematics .",
    "we investigated the relation of the stream to known substructures .",
    "we first discussed the probability of the stream being with debris from the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "this is a priori plausible because the stream does not fall far from the orbital plane of the sgr dwarf and the stream s metallicity is consistent with that of the dwarf .",
    "a comparison to the models of sagittarius dwarf debris from @xcite and @xcite , shows that although the majority of models do not yield a good fit , a certain selection of nearby stars in the oblate model provides a reasonable fit in the @xmath100-@xmath101 plane .",
    "this is most likely just coincidental however : the distributions in both distance and @xmath102 are clearly inconsistent with those of the sgr stream .",
    "also , the oblate model is the least favoured of all the models when compared to the most recent data for the sagittarius stream .",
    "we thus conclude that the aquarius stream is most likely not associated with the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "a search of other known substructures both in the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. kapteyn group ) and in the solar suburb ( e.g. canis major and virgo overdensities , monoceros stream , hercules - aquila cloud ) yielded no positive identifications .",
    "finally , to understand better how the stream is both local and localized on the sky , we performed simple dynamical simulations of a model satellite galaxy dissolving in the galactic potential .",
    "we presented simulations for two time - scales , one where the satellite is dissolving and the other when it is completely phase mixed .",
    "we compared the distribution in @xmath92 space of nearby tracer particles at the present day to that of the aquarius stream stars plus the two other marginally overdense regions found in the rave data .",
    "the model in which the progenitor has had time to become phase mixed predicts over - densities in places were the data show none . by contrast , the dissolving , not - yet - phase - mixed scenario was able to account for the localization as well as reproducing the observed structure of the aquarius stream .",
    "we therefore suggest that the stream is dynamically young : the localization could be explained as a recent disruption event of a progenitor whereby the stream has yet to occupy the available phase - space",
    ". the progenitor could either be a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy , which may or may not have survived to the present day .",
    "we make no positive identification of with any globular clusters , though there could be a possible link with likely dwarf galaxy remnant , @xmath52 cen , and the associated kapteyn group .",
    "follow - up high - resolution abundances would elucidate this possible connection .",
    "further , more sophisticated simulations of aquarius are required .",
    "this will enable a better understanding of this interesting , new halo stream which places hierarchical formation right on our proverbial doorstep .",

    "we compared the kinematic properties of the aquarius stream stars to models of the sagittarius dwarf debris , using the prolate ( q=@xmath105 ) , spherical ( q=@xmath106 ) and oblate ( q=@xmath107 ) models of @xcite ( hereafter l05 ) .",
    "we also used the triaxial model of @xcite ( hereafter l09 ) which uses a halo potential with @xmath108 within @xmath109 .",
    "we follow convention and use the parameter @xmath110 ( defined in figure 1 of l05 ) in our plots , which is the longitude from the sgr dsph in the plane of its orbit increasing away from the galactic plane .",
    "figure [ f9 ] plots @xmath110 against galactocentric radial velocity for the aquarius stream stars and the different law models .",
    "we highlight those stars from the models that have the following properties :      we are generous with the distance and galactic latitude criteria to allow for uncertainties in the models ( as well as the observational distances ) .",
    "figure [ f9 ] shows @xmath101 as a function of @xmath110 .",
    "those stars that fit the above selection criteria and that have @xmath113 are marked in green while those that have @xmath114 are marked in blue .",
    "the reason for this delineation will become evident below .    the velocities show a main feature at @xmath115 , which corresponds to the leading arm , which the models predict is vertically streaming through the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this stream gets stronger going from the prolate towards the oblate models .",
    "this large signal is not present in the rave data , as the heliocentric radial velocity is of the order of @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "@xcite showed that there is no such large asymmetry detectable in the distribution of radial velocities for stars with @xmath118 .",
    "we do see , however , that a faint signal of stars is present for the oblate models with @xmath119 , which is associated with an extra wrap of the leading arm passing south of the solar neighbourhood in this model .",
    "a value of @xmath120 separates this extra , fainter wrap from the main leading arm component predicted by the oblate model .",
    "the triaxial model does not exhibit this feature and indeed the @xmath121 stream is weaker as the leading arm misses the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we concentrate on the oblate model with its possible curl of the leading arm fitting the aquarius stream stars , as this is the only possible match . in figure [ f10 ]",
    "we show the @xmath122-@xmath71 plane as well as the @xmath123-@xmath102-@xmath124 planes for the stream stars and the solar neighbourhood stars from the oblate model .",
    "the space velocities were calculated using the radial velocities and proper motions in the rave catalog as well as the distances derived via the two different methods ( isochrone and rpmd ) .",
    "there is some overlap between the velocities from the two different distance derivations but in general we see that the space velocities are affected by the uncertainties in the distances .",
    "the rpm distances give a much tighter grouping in velocity for the stars and we take these results to be more indicative of the group s properties , plotting median error bars for these values .    the first thing to note is that the @xmath125 simulation particles do not fit the positions of the aquarius stream stars in the @xmath122-@xmath71 plane . even accounting for distance errors",
    "the distribution is strikingly different .",
    "rather , the group stars tend to be aligned spatially with the @xmath126 simulation particles .",
    "secondly , while the @xmath123 and @xmath124 values for the @xmath125 simulation particles are similar to that of the group , the values for @xmath102 very much differ from those of the aquarius stream stars . for",
    "while the errors for the stream s @xmath102 values are larger than the other velocity components , a significant ( @xmath127 ) and systematic shift would be required in this component for the stream and @xmath125 simulation particles to agree .",
    "so while there does appear to be some overlap between this faint wrap and the group in a couple of variables , both the spatial distribution and the velocity distribution do not match .",
    "this is further borne out by the proper motions : the average value for the aquarius stream stars is @xmath128 while for the @xmath125 particles it is @xmath129 .",
    "it is further worth noting that the oblate halo potential model does not compare well to sagittarius dwarf debris data .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the @xcite data set traces dynamically old sgr stream stars around the north galactic cap , where the oblate and prolate dark halos give different predictions .",
    "these data do not favour the oblate model with @xcite arguing for a spherical dark halo , while l09 favour a triaxial halo .",
    "furthermore , the absence of the sgr stream near the sun @xcite is consistent with simulations of the disruption of sgr in nearly spherical and prolate galactic potentials .",
    "thus , the only model that has a passing resemblance to the aquarius stream stars is the least likely of all those presented . on the strength of all the evidence ,",
    "we conclude that the aquarius and sagittarius streams are unrelated ."
