    "the prototypical seyfert  2 galaxy ngc1068 has played a key role in the development of ` unified ' models in which seyfert  2 galaxies host a seyfert  1  like broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "these models assume that the seyfert  2 blr is obscured toward our line of sight by a dusty torus , and have been highly successful in explaining several aspects of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the key observational evidence supporting such models came from the spectropolarimetric dectection of broad hydrogen recombination lines , first in ngc1068 ( @xcite ) and later in a number of other seyfert  2s .",
    "direct detection of the obscured blr may be , in principle , possible at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths and can provide another route to studies of seyfert unification , independent of the uncertain scattering efficiency entering the quantitative analysis of most spectropolarimetric data .",
    "in addition , if good detections or limits could be obtained for a significant sample of seyfert  2s it would be possible to place constraints on column densities and geometries of the putative tori , by studying detection rates and columns as a function of orientation .",
    "successes have been reported in detecting broad components of near - infrared recombination lines in several type 2 seyferts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the observed fwhm line widths ( 1000 to 3000 km / s ) are typically narrower than those of most classical broad - line regions . in ngc 5506 ,",
    "for example , the broadish component may trace an obscured narrow - line region ( nlr ) component rather than a true dense blr ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , column densities of a few times 10@xmath5@xmath4 as accessible to near - infrared spectroscopy fall short of the column densities expected from pc - scale torus scenarios ( @xcite ) , and barely reach column densities directly inferred from mm interferometric observations of near - nuclear gas in ngc1068 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "near - ir broad - line detections apparently pick a biased subsample : some of the detections ( ngc 2992 , ngc 5506 , a0945 - 30 ) , in fact , refer to narrow - line x - ray galaxies , in which the detection of strong x - rays suggests a significantly lower obscuring column than in most classical seyfert  2s . some of them had been previously suggested to be intermediate seyferts on the basis of possible broad lines in their optical spectra .",
    "x - ray observations are , by far , the most sensitive large column density indicators .",
    "the measured obscuring columns in seyfert 2 galaxies range from @xmath6 @xmath4 to @xmath7 @xmath4 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) suggesting that near - infrared lines may be usually fully absorbed .",
    "however , the relation between x - ray column and infrared obscuration may depend on properties of the obscuring material .",
    "there is , hence , a strong rationale for trying to detect longer wavelength recombination lines that are capable of penetrating a larger column , and to extend searches to more difficult but more rewarding x - ray quiet targets . in the following , we report on upper limits for broad 2.62@xmath1 m brackett@xmath0 , 4.05@xmath1 m brackett@xmath2 and 7.46@xmath1 m pfund@xmath2 emission from the nuclear region of ngc1068 which has one of the largest x - ray columns .",
    "the major observational difficulties in attempts to detect broad mid - infrared recombination lines are ( 1 ) the rapid fall of intrinsic recombination line fluxes towards higher series , i.e. longer wavelengths ; ( 2 ) the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) dust continuum rising steeply towards longer wavelengths , leading to small line - to - continuum ratios vulnerable to systematic effects ; and ( 3 ) the shape of the mid - infrared extinction curve which determines the wavelengths capable of penetrating the highest obscuring column . for a galactic type extinction law ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the pfund@xmath2 7.46@xmath1 m line might be a ` sweet spot ' in being intrinsically still quite bright but suffering little obscuration in the deep extinction minimum near 7@xmath1 m before the onset of silicate absorption .",
    "the same low extinction , able to penetrate columns of @xmath8@xmath9 , is only found again at very long wavelengths @xmath1030@xmath1 m where the recombination lines are intrinsically very faint and exceedingly difficult to detect against the strong dust continuum .",
    "we have used the short wavelength spectrometer sws ( @xcite ) on board the infrared space observatory iso ( @xcite ) to search for broad hydrogen recombination lines in ngc1068 .",
    "the observations were targeted at brackett@xmath0 2.62@xmath1 m , brackett@xmath2 4.05@xmath1 m and pfund@xmath2 7.46@xmath1 m , using the sws06 mode to cover ranges of @xmath116000km / s ( brackett@xmath2 which is close to an sws ` band edge ' , see below ) to @xmath1114000km / s ( pfund@xmath2 ) at a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the 14@xmath1220 aperture was oriented approximately north - south and centered on the nucleus , thus covering any hidden blr , the nlr and part of the extended emission line region .",
    "humphreys@xmath2 ( n=7 - 6 ) 12.37@xmath1 m was observed as well but does not provide a useful measurement since the sws relative spectral response in this wavelength range is less well defined due to a very complex fringing pattern .",
    "we have analyzed the data using the sws interactive analysis ( ia ) system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and calibration files as of july 1998 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the data analysis is given by lutz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) together with a presentation of our complete sws dataset on ngc1068 .",
    "broad emission is not detected significantly in any of the three lines .",
    "we will now discuss the upper limits on broad components of the various lines ( table  [ tab : blrlimits ] ) , adopting @xmath113000km / s as the fhwm of the broad emission .",
    "this is the fhwm measured for ngc1068 in polarized h@xmath0 ( @xcite , @xcite ) from regions where linewidth - preserving dust scattering dominates the scattering process .",
    "particular attention is given to the effects of relative spectral response calibration and of broad emission features from complex molecules in the ism on the determination of the underlying continuum .",
    "these are limiting factors in the search for the blr in the strong near- to mid - infrared continuum of ngc1068 .    at brackett@xmath0",
    ", nlr emission is clearly seen ( figure  [ fig : brb ] ) .",
    "lutz et al . ( 2000 ) find nlr fine structure lines over a wide range of conditions reasonably well fitted by a profile with two gaussian components , having fwhm 333 and 1246km / s , peak ratio narrow / wide 1.34 , and the wider component blueshifted by 100km / s .",
    "this is consistent with the brackett@xmath0 profile within the ( considerable ) noise .",
    "brackett@xmath0 is blended with the ( 1 - 0 ) o(2 ) ro - vibrational transition of molecular hydrogen .",
    "based on other observed h@xmath13 lines ( @xcite ) , this transition is , however , estimated to be a minor contributor ( @xmath1410% ) to the flux for the case of ngc1068 .",
    "our limit on broad ( fwhm 3000 km / s ) emission is mainly set by noise despite an integration time of @xmath153 hours .",
    "the line is observed close to the edge of one of the sws ` aot bands ' ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies increased uncertainties in the relative spectral response calibration compared to the band centers , but there is no manifest effect on the brackett@xmath0 data , since the variation of sensitivity with wavelength is slow for this particular band limit",
    ". some of the large scale curvature in the brackett@xmath0 spectrum may be due to this effect .",
    "the curvature almost certainly does not suggest an extremely broad blr component and would be inconsistent with the spectropolarimetric evidence on the width of blr lines .",
    "we note that the s / n of the data approaches the limit given by the ( average ) noise in the relative spectral response function of the twelve detectors at this wavelength .    for brackett@xmath2 , the relative spectral response changes by a factor of almost two over the short range covered by the line ( figure  [ fig : bra ] ) which is at the long wavelength end of the sws aot band 1e .",
    "under these conditions , systematic effects are very important in addition to the ( low ) detector noise",
    ". there may be residual systematic uncertainties in the spline smoothing process used for in - orbit calibration of the sws relative spectral response ( b. vandenbussche , priv .",
    "comm . ) . also , small inaccuracies of dark current subtraction can imprint a residue of the relative spectral response function on the final spectrum .",
    "the wavelength range above 4.08@xmath1 m was observed as well , but is not shown since it does not contribute to the brackett@xmath2 profile because of much higher detector noise . when overplotting the brackett@xmath2 profile with the nlr profile which fits the observed fine structure lines quite well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bra ] ) , or attempting fits of two gaussians on a sloped continuum , the wings of the brackett@xmath2 profile appear slightly wider than for the typical nlr profile .",
    "we do not consider this a detection of a broad component , however , because the excess would be @xmath141% of the continuum and not fully robust with respect to the mentioned spectral response calibration uncertainties and to location of the continuum . in table",
    "[ tab : blrlimits ] we quote a conservative upper limit for a broad component , estimated on the basis of possible systematic problems .",
    "the nondetection of broad brackett@xmath2 strengthens previous limits on such a component ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pfa ] shows the result of an @xmath111 hour integration on the pfund@xmath2 region . in this high s / n spectrum we see the wing of the very strong [ ] line as well as faint [ ] 7.318@xmath1 m and a possible unidentified feature at rest wavelength @xmath117.555@xmath1 m .",
    "pfund@xmath2 is not clearly detected , although there is a marginally significant maximum at the expected redshift ( observed wavelength 7.489@xmath1 m ) and strength of nlr pfund@xmath2 , as predicted from nlr brackett@xmath2 , case b ratios , and assuming low nlr extinction .",
    "again , we have set a conservative limit on a possible broad - line region contribution to pfund@xmath2 .",
    "the main limitation of pfund@xmath2 blr searches is the continuum definition rather than the signal - to - noise ratio of the line : not only are there the interfering lines of [ ] and [ ] but also , more importantly , the effect of continuum features .",
    "this is better illustrated in figure  [ fig : ppah ] which shows a larger part of the full sws spectrum of ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) around pfund@xmath2 both as observed , and with a tentative addition of faint starburst activity ( taken from a scaled spectrum of m82 ) to the spectrum of ngc 1068 dominated by nlr dust .",
    "it is obvious that the starburst - related emission features usually ascribed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) will induce curvature of the ` continuum ' near pfund@xmath2 since this is where the main ` 7.7@xmath1 m ' pah feature starts to rise .",
    "this curvature will make detection of very broad lines difficult if there is significant circumnuclear star formation .",
    "in addition , the shapes of the pah features are known to vary in detail with local conditions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while they are likely destroyed very close to the central agn , regions further out may contribute to a spectrum like that of ngc1068 with pah shapes differing from those for a canonical starburst , making accurate correction difficult .",
    "similar continuum definition problems may arise at a lower level even if there is no active circumnuclear starburst , since pah emission will be widespread also in the more quiescent disk of the seyfert host ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "what are the implications of our upper limits on broad lines for the structure of the obscuring material ?",
    "the derived obscuring column density sensitively depends on the adopted intrinsic blr line fluxes which are usually not known accurately . for the favorable case of ngc1068 , we are able to derive estimates ( table  [ tab : blrlimits ] ) on the basis of the intrinsic broad h@xmath0 flux derived from spectropolarimetry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and of case b recombination line ratios .",
    "case b is not strictly adequate for blr conditions since large optical depths are expected in the balmer and paschen lines ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . however , except for the leading line in each series , the ir to optical line ratios are not expected to deviate much from this simple approximation and we have therefore adopted the calculations by storey & hummer ( 1995 ) as our best estimates .",
    "the ratios are not sensitive to the adopted density and temperature and we have used the t@xmath16k , n@xmath17@xmath9 values computed from their code .",
    "the ratios relative to h@xmath0 are therefore 0.0426 for brackett@xmath0 , 0.0725 for brackett@xmath2 , and 0.0224 for pfund@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt an intrinsic broad h@xmath0 flux of @xmath18w@xmath4 on the basis of the reassuringly consistent spectropolarimetric estimates of miller , goodrich , & matthews ( 1991 ) and inglis et al .",
    "inglis et al .",
    "estimate an intrinsic broad h@xmath2 flux of @xmath19w@xmath4 , consistent with our value for a typical balmer decrement observed in agn ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the intrinsic broad h@xmath0 flux of @xmath21w@xmath4 quoted by miller , goodrich , & matthews ( 1991 ) has to be corrected upwards for our purposes : it is derived from the _ observed _ total narrow [ ] 5007 flux ( @xcite ) and the broad h@xmath0 / narrow [ ] ratio in scattered light , taken from the ` ne knot ' where the scattering properties are most homogeneous .",
    "the extinction to the narrow - line region of ngc1068 is , however , known to be significant at the wavelength of [ ] 5007 .",
    "we correct to our intrinsic broad h@xmath0 flux of @xmath22w@xmath4 , using an [ ] 5007 correction factor of @xmath114 consistent with the available extinction studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetric estimates for the intrinsic blr flux implicitly assume that the scatterers in the ` ne knot ' have a similarly unobscured view of the blr _ and _ nlr .",
    "it is evident from table  [ tab : blrlimits ] that the limits measured by iso imply a significant obscuration of the blr in the infrared .",
    "independent of detailed flux estimates , this can be explained by the following simple argument : intrinsically , the broad component of h@xmath0 will dominate the total h@xmath0 flux .",
    "this is typical for seyferts 1 in general , but for ngc1068 also demonstrated directly by spectropolarimetry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "then , if an observation detects a nlr recombination line at good s / n but fails to detect its broad component , the additional blr obscuration at that wavelength must ( still ) be significant .",
    "a brackett@xmath2 obscuration of @xmath232.4mag ( table  [ tab : blrlimits ] ) corresponds to an equivalent visual obscuration of a@xmath2450mag , and an obscuring column density of more than @xmath25@xmath4 .",
    "these quantities depend somewhat on the adopted extinction curve ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : blrlimits ] ) and on conversion to column density ( e.g. for normal ism conditions and dust - to - gas ratio n@xmath26=a@xmath27@xmath4 , predehl & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "a@xmath2450mag is a lower limit using the most conservative assumption of a galactic center extinction curve with relatively high extinction in the 4 - 8@xmath1 m range .",
    "if broad brackett@xmath2 were detected in our data , it could not be obscured by significantly more than 10@xmath28@xmath4 .",
    "this is well below the @xmath1010@xmath29@xmath4 columns needed to fit the x - ray properties of compton - thick seyferts , which consequently are also the columns used by standard ` compact ' torus models ( @xcite ) . for ngc1068 ,",
    "x - ray spectra clearly indicate an even higher obscuring column ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note however that high columns derived from x - ray spectra do not enforce a priori unobservability of the mid - infrared transitions .",
    "the relation between x - ray based column and infrared extinction may vary with gas - to - dust ratio or dust properties of the obscuring gas . empirically , the relationship between broad - line region optical / infrared obscuration and x - ray absorbing column may vary considerably from source to source ( see e.g. cases discussed in @xcite ; maiolino et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "detections or limits on infrared broad lines could , hence , determine the properties of the putative torus in a way that is independent from x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "they could also discriminate among the different classes of torus models , in particular the very high a@xmath30 compact ones ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ) from lower a@xmath30 ones where much of the x - ray obscuration will occur in dust - free gas ( e.g. @xcite ) . at this point ,",
    "the limit of a@xmath2450 approaches column densities predicted by some large scale torus models ( a@xmath31 for ngc1068 , @xcite ) but is not sufficient to discriminate strongly between the different scenarios .",
    "it is however fully consistent with the presence of large molecular column densities inferred from millimeter interferometry ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our observations help to shed light on strategies for future infrared blr searches .",
    "if the extinction in the 2 - 8@xmath1 m range follows one of the classical curves e.g. the @xmath32 power law of draine ( 1989 ) , then pfund@xmath2 would be the most favorable line for penetrating the highest columns .",
    "for such an extinction curve in conjunction with observations limited by instrumental sensitivity , lower extinction compensates for the weaker intrinsic strength of pfund@xmath2 .",
    "there are , however , indications from iso spectroscopy that the extinction at pfund@xmath2 may be almost as large as at brackett@xmath2 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this value was derived mainly for the line of sight towards our galactic center , where local conditions could obviously be different from an agn torus .",
    "other disadvantages of pfund@xmath2 are the lower line - to - continuum ratio ( for ngc1068 the continuum rises by a factor of @xmath112.5 from 4 to 7.5@xmath1 m ) , the crowded spectral region with nearby fine structure lines , strong pah emission features , and the possibility that absorption features similar to those seen towards the galactic center ( @xcite ) may be present depending on the physical conditions of the absorber .",
    "when using ngc1068 as a template for future searches for broad pfund@xmath2 , two peculiarities should be kept in mind .",
    "( 1 ) at all near- and mid - infrared wavelengths , ngc1068 is known for its strong dust continuum and resulting unusually low nlr line - to - continuum ratios .",
    "this should increase the prospects of blr detection in other seyfert  2s with more favorable line - to - continuum ratios .",
    "( 2 ) on the other hand , the proximity of ngc1068 minimizes contamination by pah emission since most of the circumnuclear star formation occurs outside a nuclear aperture , even if it is as large as that of iso .",
    "pah contamination will be a problem for many other seyfert  2s ( @xcite ) , even if somewhat smaller apertures can be employed .",
    "we hence suggest brackett@xmath2 to be a more promising target for infrared blr searches , being brighter and on a weaker continuum free of strong nearby emission and absorption features .",
    "attempts to detect broad pfund@xmath2 will definitely have to use as small as possible apertures to minimize pah dilution from circumnuclear star formation .",
