    "observations on solar neutrinos @xcite and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite have provided compelling evidences for neutrino oscillations .",
    "reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments have further confirmed the oscillation paradigm .",
    "nowadays , the fact that neutrinos do oscillate between different flavors has been established .",
    "the original idea of neutrino oscillation was proposed by pontecorvo @xcite assuming neutrino - antineutrino oscillation in a pattern similar to that between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this idea was extended to be among different flavors of neutrinos by maki , nakgawa and sakada @xcite .",
    "one of the key point ( msw effect ) in the neutrino oscillation paradigm is due to wolfenstein @xcite , mikheyev and smirnov @xcite who pointed out an effect induced by matter when a neutrino passes through it and interacts with the particles forming the matter .",
    "now it is well known that massive neutrinos naturally result in neutrino oscillations among different flavors .",
    "it is also noteworthy that other mechanisms , like lorentz symmetry violation @xcite , can also accommodate neutrino oscillations .",
    "there have been many papers discussing neutrino oscillations using lorentz violation in the literature @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation data fix the neutrino mass - squared differences and their mixings . according to a global neutrino oscillation data analysis within the three - flavor framework @xcite",
    ", the best - fit values of oscillating parameters are given as following , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "within the accuracy of present experiments , the three flavor oscillations can be reduced to two flavor oscillations in two sectors i.e. the ` solar ' sector and the ` atmospheric ' sector . in the two flavor analysis , the oscillation probability can be written as ,    @xmath12    however , recently the minos collaboration reported an anomaly in @xmath0 disappearance experiment : the oscillation parameters are determined to be @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this result is still consistent with that of @xmath3 disappearance experiment within the 3@xmath16 level , but if we take the central value seriously it may imply cpt violation , in comparison with the oscillation parameters  @xmath17 @xmath14 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 at 90% cl ) @xcite determined in @xmath3 disappearance experiment .",
    "there have been some attempts to solve this anomaly either using cpt violation @xcite or in terms of non - standard neutrino interaction @xcite , for a review about these attempts see @xcite and references therein . in the end of section 3 , we will do a detailed comparison between these attempts with ours after having presented our model .",
    "we consider the minos anomaly as a signal of lorentz and cpt violation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors point out that observable neutrino oscillations may be a combined result of neutrino masses and lorentz violation , and results of some neutrino oscillation experiments even can be explained by lorentz violation without using mass terms . in this letter",
    ", we still work in the conventional massive neutrino paradigm which solves the solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino problems . to explain the minos anomaly , a lorentz and cpt violating term is included as perturbation .",
    "we adopt a framework called standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "it is the general effective theory constructed from sm and allows any coordinate - independent lorentz violation , which might arise from the planck scale physics . in the minimal sme lagrangian ,",
    "all possible renormalizable terms constructed from sm fields which break the lorentz symmetry are added to the usual sm lagrangian .    in sme ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the neutrino sector takes the following form , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the conventional mass squared term , the other two terms are lorentz violating , the term @xmath22 is cpt odd and the term @xmath23 is cpt even .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for anti - neutrinos can be gained by reversing the sign of @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 does not change with energy while @xmath24 is proportional to energy , so that these two terms can complicate the dependence of neutrino oscillations on energies . in the following , we will explain the minos anomaly by including the term @xmath22 in the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , we would like to discuss the property of the term @xmath22 in detail before presenting our model .",
    "the term @xmath22 has something in common with the matter potential induced by the msw effect : both of them are independent of energy and cpt - odd @xcite .",
    "however , the term @xmath22 has differences with the msw effect in the following two aspects : on the one hand , the msw effect can appear only when a neutrino passes through matter and is dependent on the density and ingredient of matter @xcite , while the term @xmath22 is always constant as a vacuum property @xcite ; on the other hand , the matter potential only appears diagonally in the flavor basis while the term @xmath22 may have non - vanishing off - diagonal elements .",
    "in addition , the msw effect does not play any role in the oscillations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 when considered in the two flavor analysis , because the matter potential induced by normal matter is proportional to the identity matrix in the ( @xmath25 ) basis .",
    "in contrast , we can assume that @xmath26 differs with @xmath27 .    in the following ,",
    "we assume that the terms @xmath24 and @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are absent or negligible for some reasons .",
    "considering the energy range and the baseline distance in the minos experiment , the oscillation between @xmath29 and @xmath3 is negligible , so the two flavor analysis is still a good approximation .",
    "hence , the effective hamiltonian in the ( @xmath25 ) basis can be written as ,    1.5 @xmath30    the term on the top left corner has been chosen to be zero because the mixing only has to do with the difference of the two terms on the diagonal .",
    "besides , the minus signs before @xmath31 and @xmath32 are assigned to insure that the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are positive in order to explain the minos anomaly as we shall see .    for oscillations between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the effective hamiltonian will be got by reversing the signs before @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,    1.5 @xmath33    for convenience , we parameterize eq .",
    "( 3 ) and eq . ( 4 ) as follows , @xmath34 where @xmath22 represents @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the neutrino sector and anti - neutrino sector respectively , @xmath37 represents @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the neutrino sector and anti - neutrino sector respectively . in this case , the oscillation probability can be written as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 play the role of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) respectively .",
    "we observe that if @xmath45 and @xmath32 cancel at @xmath46 @xmath47 several gev , the term on the diagonal will be close to zero in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and the oscillations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be nearly maximal in this energy range .",
    "in contrast , @xmath32 has the opposite sign in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , so the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is not maximal any more .",
    "thus , we can understand why @xmath48 for anti - neutrinos is smaller than that for neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , both values of @xmath22 and @xmath37 in the anti - neutrino sector are larger than that in the neutrino sector , resulting in that the energy eigenvalue difference in the anti - neutrino sector is larger than that in the neutrino sector .",
    "therefore , the differences between results observed in the neutrino sector and anti - neutrino sector can be well understood .",
    "in the minos experiment , neutrinos whose energy spectrum mainly ranges from 1 to about 10 gev have a flight of 735 km before being detected .",
    "the flux of neutrinos peaks at 3 gev and has a mean energy of 4 gev .",
    "we have performed a chi - squared analysis of the data @xcite and the best - fit values of the parameters are determined to be as follows ,    @xmath49    using these values , we compare the expectation of events with the data in @xmath0 and @xmath3 disappearance experiments in fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , respectively .    1 cm        fig.1 : comparison of the measured far detector @xmath0 energy spectrum to the expectation in two cases : in the absence of oscillation ; using the oscillation parameters given in eqs .",

    "0.15 cm    in the energy range of the minos experiment , it is difficult to distinguish the model in the present letter with the models where the mass matrices in the neutrino sector and anti - neutrino sector are different .",
    "however , as energy rises , the mass term contribution will decrease while @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not change , therefore , the two scenarios will show different properties in the high energy limit .",
    "when the energy of neutrinos reaches several hundred gev , the mixing induced completely by mass terms will become very small as shown in eq .",
    "( 1 ) given a fixed distance @xmath51 , while the mixing induced by mass terms plus the lorentz violation effect will become independent of energy as shown in fig . 3 and fig . 4 below .",

    "3 shows @xmath52 as a function of energy in the neutrino sector and anti - neutrino sector ; fig .",
    "4 shows @xmath43 as a function of energy in the neutrino sector and anti - neutrino sector .",
    "as shown in these two figures , in the high energy limit where @xmath53 and @xmath32 , there is almost no difference between @xmath54 and @xmath55 and these two oscillation patterns will be independent of energy .",
    "there is a distinct character in the neutrino sector : when the energy of neutrinos is around 20 gev , @xmath43 has a vanishing point , so the oscillations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 are highly suppressed in this small energy range .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the energy range of solar neutrinos ( a few mev ) , @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so @xmath31 and @xmath32 will not affect the explanation of the solar neutrino problem . however",
    ", this model will be constrained by the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data . in super - k experiment ,",
    "events generated by neutrinos and anti - neutrinos can not be distinguished , so the results can not supply strong constraints . in future , the long baseline experiments for the oscillations @xmath3 @xmath1 @xmath4 and @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 at high energy ( several tens of gev ) with high precision can confirm or exclude this model .    finally , we would like to do a comparison between other attempts solving the minos anomaly with ours . in @xcite",
    ", the authors use cpt violation to solve the minos anomaly and consider that neutrinos and anti - neutrinos do have unequal mass differences at least in the atmospheric neutrino sector . however , in our model , mass differences in the neutrino sector and that in the anti - neutrino sector are equal . because the mass term and the term @xmath22 have different dependence on energy ,",
    "the models in @xcite which only contain the mass term will show different properties on energy from our model which includes the term @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , experiments in different energy ranges can distinguish these two kinds of models .",
    "in the low energy range where the mass term is much larger than the term @xmath22 in our model , there is no cpt violation observable in neutrino oscillation experiments , while there is always cpt violation irrespective of the energy of neutrinos in the models of @xcite .",
    "only when the energy of neutrinos reaches the order of gev can the cpt - violating effect emerge in our model .",
    "when it comes to @xcite , we have given the comparison between the term @xmath22 and the potential induced by neutrino interaction in section 2 .",
    "they share some similarities , but the essential difference between them is that the cpt - violating term @xmath22 is property of vacuum , while the matter potential is dependent on the concrete circumstance the neutrinos experience during their flight .",
    "experiments can distinguish these two mechanisms too .",
    "in conclusion , the minos anomaly if it really exists can be successfully explained by using a cpt - violating term in the formalism of sme as perturbation to the conventional mass - induced oscillation paradigm .",
    "meanwhile , some odd conclusions are arrived : in the energy range around 20 gev , oscillations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be highly suppressed due to the very small mixing ; in the high energy limit where the mass term is small enough compared to the terms from sme , @xmath3 @xmath1 @xmath4 and @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 will have the same oscillating pattern which is independent of energy . considering the data are statistically limited , the quantitative results are inconclusive",
    ". however , if the minos anomaly persists , it maybe become the first evidence of lorentz violation which has a significant meaning .",
