    "recently the compass collaboration observed the @xmath0 in the @xmath2 final state in the reaction @xmath3 , the measured mass and width are 1420 mev and 140 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "although there are controversies about the quark structures of the @xmath4 , it contains some @xmath5 constituents , irrespective of the two - quark state , molecular state or tetraquark state assignments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 is excellent candidate of the axial - vector tetraquark state with the symmetric spin structure @xmath6_{s=1}[\\bar{s}\\bar{d}]_{s=0 } + [ su]_{s=0}[\\bar{s}\\bar{d}]_{s=1}$ ] . on the other hand",
    ", the axial - vector meson @xmath7 with @xmath1 has the mass and width @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the width of the @xmath10 is much smaller than that of the @xmath0 , it is unlikely that the @xmath0 and @xmath7 are the same particle .    in this article , we take the @xmath0 as the axial - vector tetraquark state , study its mass and pole residues using the qcd sum rules , and make possible assignment of the @xmath0 in the tetraquark scenario .",
    "the qcd sum rules is a powerful theoretical tool is studying the ground state hadrons and has given many successful descriptions of the masses , decay constants , form - factors , coupling constants , etc @xcite .    the article is organized as : we derive the qcd sum rules for the axial - vector tetraquark states in section 2 ; in section 3 we present numerical results and discussions ; while the last section is reserved for our conclusion .",
    "we write down the two - point correlation functions @xmath11 in the qcd sum rules firstly , @xmath12 where the currents @xmath13 , the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are color indexes , the @xmath19 is the charge conjunction matrix .",
    "the factor @xmath20 is added to normalize the current @xmath21 , the @xmath22 is the mixing angle . the currents @xmath23 and @xmath21 have the quantum numbers @xmath1 , we choose them to interpolate the tetraquark state and two - quark - tetraquark mixed state , respectively .",
    "the current @xmath24 has the quantum numbers @xmath25 , we choose it to study the negative charge conjunction partner of the axial - vector tetraquark state as a byproduct .    at the hadronic representation ,",
    "the ground states contributions from the axial - vector mesons can be written as @xmath26 where the pole residues @xmath27 are defined by @xmath28 the @xmath29 are the polarization vectors of the axial - vector mesons @xmath30 .",
    "we calculate the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to dimension-10 in the operator product expansion , assume vacuum saturation to factorize the higher dimension vacuum condensates to lower dimension vacuum condensates , and obtain the spectral densities at the level of quark - gluon degree s of freedom through dispersion relation .",
    "then we take the quark - hadron duality below the continuum thresholds @xmath31 and perform borel transform with respect to the variable @xmath32 to obtain three qcd sum rules , @xmath33 where the @xmath34 with @xmath35 are the qcd spectral densities corresponding to the interpolating currents @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath21 , respectively , @xmath36 ^ 2}{1296}\\langle\\frac{\\alpha_sgg}{\\pi}\\rangle\\delta(t)+\\frac{5m_s\\left[\\langle\\bar{q}g_s\\sigma g q\\rangle-\\langle\\bar{s}g_s\\sigma g s\\rangle \\right]t}{3456\\pi^4 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\left[\\langle\\bar{q } q\\rangle-\\langle\\bar{s } s\\rangle \\right]\\left[\\langle\\bar{q}g_s\\sigma g q\\rangle-\\langle\\bar{s}g_s\\sigma g s\\rangle \\right]}{288\\pi^2 } -\\frac{\\left[\\langle\\bar{q}g_s\\sigma g q\\rangle-\\langle\\bar{s}g_s\\sigma g s\\rangle \\right]^2}{1728\\pi^2}\\delta(t ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath37 ^",

    "we usually take the following two criteria of the qcd sum rules : + @xmath56 pole dominance at the phenomenological side ; + @xmath56 convergence of the operator product expansion @xcite , + to choose the borel parameters and continuum threshold parameters .",
    "it is difficult to satisfy the two criteria as the conventional two - quark mesons for the light tetraquark states @xcite , we have to release either of the two criteria . in other words , we can retain pole dominance by choosing small borel parameters or retain convergence of the operator product expansion by choosing large borel parameters .    in calculations ,",
    "we observe that there appear borel platforms ( or minimum ) at a special value below @xmath57 , then the hadronic masses increase monotonously with increase of the borel parameters , although the curves of the line - shapes are not steep in some cases . on the other hand ,",
    "the pole dominance is well satisfied at the region @xmath58 .",
    "if we choose the borel parameters at the region @xmath58 , the dominant contributions come from the @xmath59 and @xmath60 terms rather than the perturbative terms , the vacuum condenses ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , etc ) of dimension 10 are of minor importance .    in this article",
    ", we retain the criterium of pole dominance and modify the criterium of convergence of the operator product expansion to be the contributions of the vacuum condensates of dimension 10 are less ( or much less ) than @xmath63 of that of the @xmath59 .",
    "then the operator product expansion is still convergent , but the convergent behavior is slower than that of the conventional two - quark mesons .    .",

    "we take into account all uncertainties of the input parameters , and obtain the masses and pole residues of the axial - vector mesons , which are shown table 1 and fig.1 .    from table 1",
    ", we can see that the tetraquark states with the @xmath1 and @xmath64 have almost degenerate masses , the values @xmath65 and @xmath66 are above the experimental value @xmath67 .",
    "the numerical results disfavor assigning the @xmath0 as the axial - vector tetraquark state .",
    "the mass of the axial - vector meson @xmath68 is @xmath69 from the particle data group @xcite . if we take the @xmath0 as the mixed state of the @xmath68 and tetraquark state @xmath6_{s=1}[\\bar{s}\\bar{d}]_{s=0 } + [ su]_{s=0}[\\bar{s}\\bar{d}]_{s=1}$ ] , the component @xmath68 can reduce the mass to the experimental value . in calculations , we observe that the mixing angle @xmath70 lead to the value @xmath71 , which reproduces the experimental data .",
