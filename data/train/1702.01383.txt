    "wave propagation problems can often be efficiently discretized with high order finite difference methods . due to stability consideration ,",
    "the formal accuracy order of the discretization scheme is typically considerably lower close to computational boundaries than that of the interior scheme .",
    "however , the numerical solution often converges at a rate higher than indicated by the boundary truncation error , a phenomenon termed as _ gain in convergence_. there are two different methods for analyzing how much is gained in the convergence rate , the energy method and the normal mode analysis @xcite . applying the energy method in a straightforward way indicates a half order gain in convergence .",
    "an exception is that in @xcite a careful derivation of the energy is performed to the heat equation , and the analysis leads to a gain of 1.5 orders in convergence .",
    "however , the computations show a gain of two orders .",
    "sharper error estimates can be obtained by the normal mode analysis . for first order hyperbolic equations ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that one order can be gained compared with the boundary truncation error . in @xcite",
    "it is noted by a normal mode approach that the optimal gain in convergence is the same as the highest derivative of the spatial derivatives .",
    "a detailed analysis in @xcite for a class of discretizations for the schrdinger equation proves the gain is two orders , which equals the optimal gain .",
    "results for the wave equation are presented in @xcite , where it is shown that a unified result of convergence rate can not be obtained .",
    "the accuracy analyses in the above mentioned references are limited to problems in one space dimension .",
    "however , the one dimensional analysis can not always explain two dimensional numerical results .",
    "one example is two dimensional problems discretized in a multi  block setting , where numerical solutions in regions with different grid spacings are coupled using interpolations @xcite . for cases like this",
    ", large truncation errors are located at grid points on the edge of the interface between two mesh blocks .",
    "we refer to such points as _ corner points _ , shown in figure [ fig : grid](a ) .",
    "the number of corner points depends on the particular discretization but is independent of the grid spacing .",
    "because the large truncation errors are localized in both spatial dimensions , it is a situation that does not occur for one dimensional problems .",
    "numerical results in the literature indicate that some of such two dimensional cases may lead to higher convergence rates than what the one dimensional analysis predicts as `` the best you can hope for '' , see for instance @xcite . the numerical results also indicate that depending on the partial differential equation and the interface treatment , the gain in convergence rates may be different .",
    "accuracy analysis for two dimensional problems is needed in order to fully understand these results .",
    "in this paper we present a general accuracy analysis framework for semi ",
    "discrete pdes in two space dimensions to better understand the effect localized truncation errors have on the overall spatial discretization error . as a model problem",
    "we consider the semi ",
    "discretization of the wave equation by finite difference methods .",
    "in particular , we use summation  by  parts ( sbp ) finite difference methods with weak imposition of boundary conditions by the simultaneous approximation term ( sat ) method .",
    "the technique we develop is not limited to this class of methods .",
    "we mainly consider two cases .",
    "the first case is when a large truncation error is located along an entire boundary , for example localized in the @xmath0direction but not in the @xmath1direction .",
    "this is a typical situation with a standard finite difference scheme , where lower order stencils are used near boundaries . in the second case ,",
    "a large truncation error is located at only a few grid points near a boundary , i.e. localized in two space dimensions as shown in figure [ fig : grid](b ) .",
    "this is a simplified model of the case shown in figure [ fig : grid](a ) .",
    "the accuracy analysis relies on a transformation of the two dimensional problem to many one dimensional problems of the same type .",
    "each one dimensional problem is then analyzed by the normal mode analysis , a technique involving laplace  transformation in time .",
    "we show how for a one dimensional problem the error is dictated by the behaviour of a boundary system in the origin of the @xmath2plane , where @xmath2 is the laplace dual variable of time .",
    "this was discussed previously in @xcite , and in this paper we make the arguments more precise .",
    "we also show how to use the one dimensional results to obtain results for both two dimensional cases .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the two dimensional accuracy analysis , as well as the accuracy analysis for the relevant one dimensional problems .",
    "properties for the semi  discrete system discretized with sbp operators and weak treatment of boundary conditions are described in section [ sec - sbp ] .",
    "sections [ sec_ne ] and [ sec_c ] contain numerical experiments and conclusions , respectively .",
    "we consider the two dimensional wave equation @xmath3 on a domain @xmath4 with suitable initial and boundary conditions so that is wellposed .",
    "we in particular consider the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "a comprehensive discussion on the wellposedness of second order hyperbolic equations is found in @xcite . because the focus in this paper is the accuracy analysis of numerical methods solving equation , we assume that the solution is sufficiently smooth and in l@xmath5 at any time .",
    "this gives rise to compatibility conditions between the initial and boundary data at the space ",
    "time corners .",
    "one way to guarantee that the compatibility conditions are satisfied is to assume that both spatial derivatives of the initial data on the boundary , and temporal derivatives of the boundary data at @xmath6 , vanish up to sufficiently high order .",
    "we take this approach in the present work .",
    "the domain is discretized by an equidistant grid with a grid spacing @xmath7 in both spatial directions @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the spatial derivatives are approximated by finite difference operators yielding the semi ",
    "discretization @xmath10 in equation , @xmath11 is a grid function approximating the true solution @xmath12 on the grid and is arranged column  wise ,",
    "i.e. the first @xmath13 components of @xmath11 are the numerical solutions at the grid points on the boundary @xmath14 .",
    "the finite difference operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 include an implementation of the boundary conditions , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are identity operators .",

    "inhomogeneous boundary data would also appear in the right  hand side of , but is excluded here for a sake of simplified notation as it has no effect on the accuracy analysis . to consider accuracy , we need the semi ",
    "discretization to be stable .",
    "one way to prove stability is to show by the energy method that the numerical solution in some appropriate norm is bounded by the data , and such a scheme is called energy stable . in particular , we consider operators @xmath22 that satisfies the following property .",

    "wise error is @xmath36 .",
    "the error equation corresponding to the two - dimensional semi - discretization in equation is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the truncation error . in the interior of the computational domain",
    ", the standard central finite difference stencils can be used to approximate derivatives .",
    "these stencils give a truncation error of even order @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , referred to as the interior truncation error . on a few grid points near the boundary , one sided stencils",
    "are typically used to approximate derivatives .",
    "a stable spatial discretization is necessary , and to obtain that the one sided stencils often give a truncation error @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",

    "however , the number of grid points with boundary truncation error @xmath41 is independent of the grid spacing @xmath7 .",
    "the effect the boundary truncation error has on the convergence rate may therefore be weakened . applying the energy method to the error equation",
    "yields a convergence rate of @xmath44 , i.e. 1/2 order is recovered with respect to the boundary truncation error .",
    "however , this result is often not sharp and many numerical experiments show a higher convergence rate @xcite .",
    "normal mode analysis can be used to derive a sharper estimate @xcite , involving a matrix of small size depending on the laplace space parameter @xmath2 . in many cases",
    "the analysis becomes technical , because a precise dependence of @xmath2 for the matrix is typically needed . in the following subsection",
    "we show how to deconstruct the two dimensional problem into a number of one dimensional problems that can be analyzed separately , and how to combine the results to one single error estimate .",

    "we present the accuracy analysis for some two dimensional problems with truncation errors localized in both spatial dimensions .",

    "the special structure does not exist anymore , and consequently the gain is only one order for such a one dimensional problem . in conclusion , both cases are in agreement with the accuracy analysis in section [ sec_localized_error ] .    the case analyzed in section [ sec_localized_error ] is a simplified model of a multi  block finite difference discretization with non  conforming grid interfaces , see figure [ fig : grid](a ) .",

    "we then continue the analysis by utilizing the results from the one dimensional analysis .",
    "we have chosen the second order wave equation as the model problem , but the technique presented in this paper can be used to analyze other equations .    the second contribution of this paper is the analysis of the effect of truncation errors localized at a few grid points in a corner of a two dimensional problem .",
    "such truncation errors often occur in multi  block finite differences with non  conforming grid interfaces .",
    "the analysis is performed for a simplified but analogous problem , a single block with large truncation errors at a few grid points close to a corner .",
    "the numerical experiments for the simplified problem show that our accuracy analysis is sharp .",
    "in addition , numerical experiments in a multi  block setting presented in @xcite also agree well with this analysis .",
    "in addition , we have presented a detailed framework of analyzing the convergence rate by the normal mode analysis , and shown that the critical point is to derive sharp error estimates in the vicinity of @xmath279 in laplace space .",
