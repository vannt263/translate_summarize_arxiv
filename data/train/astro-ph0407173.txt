    "the angular diameter and flux of a planetary nebula ( pne ) are much needed parameters when modelling the optical spectrum and evolution of the nebula and its central star . from these parameters the density and mass of the pne",
    "can be calculated , as well as the extinction along the line of sight .",
    "pne also provide an independent tracer of stellar populations and extinction in regions where visual tracers , such as hot luminous stars , are lacking .    at the distance of the bulge of @xmath5 kpc",
    "@xcite many pne are only a few arc seconds across",
    ". therefore determination of angular diameters , by deconvolving fwhm measurements , need to use methods that take into account ionisation structure and the particular emission line observed .",

    "* hereafter vh ) provide two suitable methods of deconvolution .",
    "spectroscopic flux measurements can lead to a possible underestimation if the slit is not properly aligned with the source",
    ". therefore accurate determination of fluxes can be achieved using calibrated narrow - band filters , provided that correction for the underlying continuum and any unwanted lines is applied .",
    "extinction can then be calculated from observed h@xmath0 and catalogue radio flux ratios , and compared with values calculated from catalogue h@xmath0/h@xmath1 flux ratios . a method for determining @xmath2 , the ratio of total to selective extinction ,",
    "can also be derived .",
    "correction for interstellar extinction is necessary for determining emission line ratios , absolute fluxes , and some distance calculations .",
    "usually , a single galactic extinction law is used for dereddening .",
    "however , the emission mechanism of ionized media is well understood , and pne are intrinsically very bright .",
    "this allows one to use pne to determine extinction constants for galactic dust distribution studies , for line of sights where few other good tracers are available .    in order to improve the accuracy of available pne data , we have obtained narrow - band h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] ccd images of a sample of galactic pne and calculated values for angular diameter , flux and extinction .",

    "we observed 70 galactic pne during the two nights of 2002 june 24 & 25 , using the eso 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) in chile .",
    "we used the emmi camera ( eso multi - mode instrument ) , which at the time had a 2046  @xmath9  2046  pixel tektronix ccd with an image scale of 027/pixel . for each object a pair of exposures were taken using on- and off - band h@xmath0 filters .",
    "16 of the objects were also observed with on- and off - band [ oiii ] filters .",
    "the fwhm of the on - band filters are adapted to the high velocity range of the observed pne ( 200 to 300 km s@xmath10 in the galactic bulge , corresponding to @xmath11 5 ) .",
    "the characteristics of the filters , in  , are listed in table  [ filterchars ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ filterplots ] .",
    "it should be noted that , to avoid contamination by the [ nii ] 6584  line , the h@xmath0 on - band filter is centred on 6549  and not 6563 .    in fig .",
    "[ filterplots ] the dashed curves are the filter response values provided by eso , and the solid curves are response values calculated from calibration spectra taken at the ntt ( h@xmath0 in 2004 february using grism # 3 at a resolution of 1.5 , interpolated to 0.1 ; [ oiii ] in 2003 june using grism # 3 at a resolution of 3 , interpolated to 1 ) .",
    "the solid vertical lines denote la silla - air wavelengths and the dashed vertical lines the spread of observed wavelengths due to doppler shifting . assuming the same equivalent widths ,",
    "the h@xmath0 on - band filter # 654 has blue - shifted by @xmath12  and the [ oiii ] on - band filter # 589 has red - shifted by @xmath13 . it can be seen that for [ oiii ] this shift makes little difference to the calculation of actual flux values .",
    "however , for h@xmath0 the shift is significant , as actual observed wavelengths are in the steep redward side of the curve ( especially for positive radial velocities relative to the telescope ) .",
    "because the filters in the red arm of emmi are used in the parallel beam , there is a large change in central wavelength with position on the detector .",
    "the solid curve is given for the optical centre of the field . because objects were not always positioned at the optical centre of the ccd array ( up to @xmath14 pixels on the first night and up to @xmath15 pixels on the second ) ,",
    "wavelength corrections were calculated to take into account the filter angle of 7.5relative to the ccd array .",
    "this only affected offsets in the @xmath16-axis , with a 20 pixel offset generating a wavelength shift of 0.6 .",
    "for these reasons , in particular , we chose to calculate precise doppler wavelength shifts when determining actual observed flux values .",
    "we have not been able to determine the reason for the shift in filter transmission curves , so would therefore recommend always taking calibration spectra from the optical centre of the field in order to check filter response data .",
    "to reduce the ccd readout time and hence improve the observing duty cycle , only the central 400  @xmath9  400 pixels ( 108  @xmath9  108 ) of the detector were read out .",
    "calibration of the ccd images followed standard procedures : subtraction of a constant value to represent the bias , and removal of the background continuum , achieved by subtracting the off - band image , scaled by the integrated transmission ratio of the two filters ( @xmath17 ) , from the on - band image .",
    "the ratios were 0.31 for the h@xmath0 filter and 0.84 for the [ oiii ] filter . where necessary and prior to this subtraction , pairs of images were brought into alignment by integer pixel shifts of the off - band image in the @xmath18 and/or @xmath16 direction .",
    "for the first night s observations this involved shifts of only one or two pixels . however , due to taking spectra between on- and off - band exposures , the second night s observations required shifts of between 20 and 30 pixels .",
    "one off - band image ( 356.1@xmath1902.7 th3 - 13 ) had to be rotated as well , to bring it into alignment .",
    "this procedure removed the background field stars , except for objects with spectral lines within the filter band .",
    "correction with dome flats was not considered necessary due to the sources being very small and pixel to pixel variations in the centre of the ccd contributing a possible error in flux values of only 1 per cent .",
    "all exposures were for 30 seconds with the autoguider deactivated , as the ntt can track without guiding for several minutes .",
    "the resulting images show no sign of elongation of the field stars .",
    "ten second exposures of two tertiary standard stars were also taken for flux calibration .",
    "seeing conditions varied between one and two arc seconds .",
    "subsequent image analysis was done using the eso munich image data analysis system ( midas ) .",
    "bulge pne were concentrated on , but non - bulge objects were also observed to make best use of telescope time . using a galactic bulge criteria for the galactic coordinates ( pn g ) of @xmath20 and @xmath21 gives 56 bulge pne and 14 non - bulge pne . however , adopting the criteria of @xcite : @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ; 4.2 mjy @xmath25 45 mjy , gives 39 bulge pne and 31 non - bulge pne .",
    "the non - bulge pne include two sagittarius dwarf galaxy objects @xcite .",
    "the images presented here are broadened by the seeing .",
    "this must be taken into account when deriving angular diameters and we now describe the methods used to deconvolve the point spread function ( beam size ) .    using the method of bz",
    ", the point spread function ( psf ) was approximated with a gaussian fwhm of @xmath26 , by fitting gaussian profiles to four distinct field stars in each of the on - band images , taking the mean value and expressing the error as the standard deviation of the four readings .",
    "the results are listed in column four of table  [ diamsa ] , with an overall mean value for @xmath26 of 155 .",
    "the fwhm of the nebulae @xmath27 , was measured by fitting two dimensional gaussian profiles to the corrected on - band images . as bz point out , if the objects were gaussian , deconvolution would be trivial , and the true fwhm of the nebulae would simply be    @xmath28    although @xmath29 is not a realistic model for pne , a correction factor @xmath30 , can be applied in order to determine the true diameter , @xmath31 .",
    "various methods of calculating this factor have been investigated by vh and the conversion factor @xmath30 is found to be a function of @xmath1 , the resolution of the observation , i.e. the ratio of the gaussian diameter and the point spread function , @xmath32 . according to vh , @xmath33 can be approximated extremely well by the following analytic function ( vh method a ) :    @xmath34    which will be used throughout this paper ( appropriate parameters for equation [ gamma ] are given in table  [ params ] ) .",

    "2 shows that the shape of the curve for the conversion factor @xmath30 does not change very much as a function of @xmath38 , but that the height of the curve does .",
    "therefore , the correct value for @xmath30 depends critically on the assumed value for the inner radius , @xmath39 , with differences of up to 40 per cent , depending on the choice @xmath39 .",
    "vh also examines what he considers to be more realistic geometries based on a photoionization model of pne .",
    "this model takes into account emissivity and absorption of specific lines as a function of distance to the star . as vh point out",
    ", the surface brightness profile is very sensitive to optical depth effects and thus different emission lines will yield different diameters .",
    "measured diameters will also be different , depending on which line is used , because of ionisation stratification effects .",
    "vh also present an alternative algorithm for determination of the intrinsic fwhm of a source , using the observed surface brightness distribution and the fwhm of the beam ( psf ) .",
    "this was not investigated as knowledge of the intrinsic surface brightness distribution is still needed to convert the intrinsic fwhm of the source to the true diameter .",
    "the reader is referred to vh for a full discussion of the various methods that can be used to measure angular diameters of extended sources .",
    "based on the above we chose to calculate diameters using two models : a constant emissivity shell , @xmath40 ( where an inner diameter of @xmath41 was chosen because it represents a filling factor of 0.5 ) ; and photoionization line emission , @xmath42 . in table",

    "<S> for the same subset we calculate @xmath4 , confirming that toward the bulge interstellar extinction is steeper than @xmath3 . for the inner galaxy a relation with the higher supernova rate is suggested , and that the low - density warm ionized medium is the site of the anomalous extinction . </S>",
