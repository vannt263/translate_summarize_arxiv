    "( 0,0 ) ( 35,+292 )    the calculation of the effective transport properties of random composite media is important in many scientific and engineering applications@xcite .",
    "several techniques ( effective medium approximations and cluster expansions ) have been developed for predicting the effective properties of such materials ( briefly reviewed in ref .",
    "however difficulties encountered in such methods have provided the impetus for the development of rigorous bounds @xcite .",
    "such bounds rely on statistical descriptions of the microstructure of the material which are available for relatively few classes of media .",
    "the advancement of computing technology @xcite has also made direct simulation of effective properties feasible .",
    "it is the latter two approaches which we shall discuss here , in the context of the effective conductivity of a three dimensional amorphous isotropic two phase material .",
    "there has been significant advances in the evaluation of the beran - milton@xcite ( bm ) bounds in the past decade .",
    "the key parameter @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) which incorporates microstructural information regarding the composite has been evaluated primarily for materials comprised of statistically independent cells @xcite or dispersions of regularly shaped inclusions @xcite . the simulation of the effective conductivity of continuum random media is a computationally intensive process and has only recently been studied for the second class of materials@xcite .",
    "such an approach provides a basis for testing the bounding theories and for generating outright predictions of the effective properties of composites .",
    "a class of materials which is not , in general , well described by cellular or particulate models is that of amorphous composites .",
    "such materials arise in certain alloys @xcite , microemulsions @xcite and other systems @xcite .",
    "the model which best captures some of the salient features of such composites is the spatially uncorrelated penetrable sphere ( or the identical overlapping sphere ) model @xcite . due to the simplicity in evaluating the statistical correlation functions of such a material it has served as a useful ` model ' amorphous medium @xcite",
    ". however specific features of this model restrict its generality .",
    "the inclusion ( sphere ) phase and the matrix phase are topologically very different , the small scale structure of the phase boundaries is spherical and there are no long range correlations in the model .",
    "an alternative approach is to empirically measure the specific correlation functions of a sample and to apply the results in the evaluation of bounds @xcite .",
    "this approach is complicated and subject to error .",
    "it is therefore interesting to seek a more complex model of amorphous composites , yet simple enough so that the correlation functions can be calculated .",
    "another method of modeling random composites is to define the interface between the phases as a level cut of some random field @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent progress @xcite in the theory of interfaces of level - cut gaussian random fields has made it possible to calculate the statistical information necessary for the evaluation of the bm bounds .",
    "there is evidence that the gaussian random interface model is a good approximation to certain oil - water microemulsions@xcite and we conjecture that it is a reasonable model for amorphous alloys .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effective conductivity of such media using the above mentioned bounding techniques and computer simulations .",
    "the results are compared with the previously studied models to demonstrate the differences that arise .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ bounds ]",
    "we describe the equations governing the electric field in a composite medium and the bounds on the effective conductivity . in sections",
    "[ correlation ] & [ determination ] we derive the statistical correlation functions for the random media and apply them in the calculation of the microstructure parameter .",
    "sections [ generation]-[results ] are concerned with the generation of the random materials , the simulation of the effective conductivity and comparison of the data with the bounds .",
    "the relationship between the current density @xmath4 and the electric field @xmath5 is given by ohms law , @xmath6 where , due to charge conservation , @xmath7 satisfies , @xmath8 throughout the material .",
    "at the boundary of different regions of the material with conductivities @xmath9 and @xmath10 we have , @xmath11 the effective conductivity is defined by a macroscopic form of ohm s law , @xmath12 now consider a composite material made up of two components with conductivities @xmath9 and @xmath10 with volume fractions @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the effective conductivity will then depend on the @xmath15 , their respective volume fractions , and the spatial distribution ( microstructure ) of each phase @xcite .",
    "the first bounds on @xmath0 were calculated by wiener @xcite who proved that @xmath16 .",
    "these bounds assume no details about the microstructure and are hence valid for a general composite . as more statistical information regarding the composite",
    "is included in the calculation of the bounds they become more restrictive .",
    "if the sample is assumed to be isotropic and macroscopically homogeneous then the 2nd order bounds of hashin and sthrikman@xcite are applicable . to distinguish between such materials the third order bounds of beran are necessary .",
    "( the term @xmath17th order bounds refers to the fact that the bounds are exact to @xmath18 ) . the beran @xcite bounds were derived using variational principles and were subsequently simplified by milton @xcite . following the notation of milton we define @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( interchanging @xmath13 and @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 . here @xmath23 or @xmath24 . in these terms",

    "milton notes these bounds converge when @xmath31 and are equal to one of the 2nd order hashin - sthrikman bounds in each case .",
    "an improved lower bound has been derived by milton @xcite for the case @xmath32 . in later sections we consider materials with @xmath33 for which this bound is ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by interchanging the roles of the materials , @xmath34 where @xmath35 . by way of mathematical analogy",
    "these bounds also apply to to the effective dielectric , diffusion and magnetic permeability coefficients of composite materials .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the calculation of statistical correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the case of the three point solid - solid correlation function has been considered empirically @xcite , and theoretically for cellular materials @xcite and spherical inclusions @xcite to name a few . here",
    "we take the interface between the phases to be defined by a level cut of a random field @xcite .",
    "now consider a gaussian random field @xmath36 @xcite ( see section [ generation ] ) and let the level sets @xmath37 define the interface ( with the region @xmath38 being phase 1 ) .",

    "the following identities are used @xcite , @xmath52 and @xmath53 where the contour @xmath54 is directed along the real axis except near the origin where it crosses the imaginary axis in the upper half plane .",

    "a useful non - rigorous approximation to @xmath75 can be developed by requiring that the approximation have similar properties to the actual function for @xmath76 and satisfy the known consistency conditions in various limits @xcite . using the compact notation @xmath77 and @xmath78 we have ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath79 using this information , and including a higher order term for consistency ( @xmath80 ) we construct , @xmath81 we note that this approximation has a maximum absolute error of @xmath82 for the materials considered here . as such",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "we now describe aspects of the computation of @xmath2 for several spectra of the gaussian random interface ( gri ) model .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath88 for @xmath89 @xcite ( see appendix [ zhalf ] ) and that @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the microstructure parameter associated with phase 2 . as @xmath2 is dimensionless it must depend only on the ratios of the length scales associated with the spatial variables in the ( dimensionless ) correlation functions . that this should be so also follows from a simple dimensional analysis of the equations governing the electric field ( no physical length scale is present ) .",
