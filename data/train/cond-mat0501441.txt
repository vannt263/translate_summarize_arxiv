    "it was first suggested by london that the ability of liquid @xmath0he ii to flow through narrow capillaries without apparent friction is a consequence of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "@xcite the concept of bec was later generalized by penrose and onsager to be applicable to interacting particles .",
    "@xcite it was further generalized and systematically investigated by yang , as the notion of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) .",
    "@xcite now it is known that the no - friction behavior in narrow capillaries is only one of several phenomena of superfluidity .",
    "@xcite as elaborated by leggett ,  @xcite the most basic manifestation of superfluidity is the hess - fairbank effect ,  @xcite which was also called `` nonclassical rotational inertial '' ( ncri ) by leggett .",
    "@xcite this refers to the refusal of the system to rotate with its container , when its angular velocity is sufficiently low .",
    "it is the counterpart of the meissner effect of superconductivity . furthermore , the quantization of angular momentum of the superfluid in the rotating container is the counterpart of the magnetic flux quantization in a superconductor .    in the case of superconductivity ,",
    "the demonstration of meissner effect and the magnetic flux quantization , as consequences of odlro , was made by yang ,  @xcite and by sewell and nieh _ et al . _ in a more recent alternative approach .",
    "@xcite bloch discussed the relation between superconducting persistent current and odlro .",
    "@xcite in the case of superfluidity , kohn and sherrington derived the hess - fairbank effect as a consequence of odlro by using a sophisticated hierarchy of equations of thermal green functions .",
    "@xcite for a noninteracting bose gas and a gross - pitaevskii system , leggett made a clear - cut demonstration of hess - fairbank effect and quantization of angular momentum as consequences of bec .",
    "@xcite earlier , in an extremely thorough and insightful discussion ,  @xcite leggett pointed out that a sufficient condition of superfluidity is a certain topological connectedness property of the many - body wavefunction , and that at least for zero temperature , odlro gives rise to this connectivity and thus superfluidity , but for a finite temperature , whether odlro is sufficient for superfluidity in general is not conclusive .",
    "moreover , leggett established , from the point of view of connectivity of wavefunction , that bec and ncri behavior can in principle also be exhibited by a solid .",
    "@xcite recently , kim and chan clearly observed ncri - like behavior in bulk solid @xmath0he in an annulus channel ,  @xcite shortly after an earlier such observation in solid @xmath0he confined in porous vycor glass .",
    "@xcite but a consensus on its origin is yet to be reached .",
    "@xcite the earliest predictions on supersolidity , i.e. superfluid behavior in a solid , were based on bec of defect states .  @xcite but the concentration of zero - point vacancies is less than @xmath1 according to the experimental results .",
    "@xcite thus an important question is whether it is possible for a pure commensurate sample of solid @xmath0he , i.e. without vacancies or interstitials , become a supersolid .",
    "negative answers were given recently in a path integral monte carlo calculation of exchange frequencies in bulk hcp @xmath0he ,  @xcite and in a general argument about superfluidity density .",
    "@xcite    thus from both the fundamental point of view and the perspective of understanding supersolid behavior , it appears still interesting to make a general derivation of the hess - fairbank effect and quantization of angular momentum as clear consequences of odlro for an interacting bose system in a rotating container . in this paper , we first make such a derivation . afterwards , for a reason explained below , we rederive the superfluid density in the path integral formulation ,  @xcite which is the very basis of the analyses of solid @xmath0he in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "finally , we consider the trial wavefunctions ever used in variational calculations for solid helium , including the hartree wavefunction , the hatree - fock wavefunction and the nosanow - jastrow wavefunction .",
    "it is shown that there is no odlro or bec in these wavefunctions . moreover , by examining the dependence of free energy on the rotation velocity of the container , we explicitly demonstrate that a commensurate solid described by such wavefunctions can not possess ncri , in absence of vacancies or interstitials , even if there exist zero - point motion and the exchange effect .    note that the non - superfluidity of the hartree - fock wavefunction made up of localized single particle wavepackets has been discussed by leggett from the point of view of disconnectivity of the wavefunction long ago .",
    "@xcite our approach provides an explicit construction of the rotating wavefunction under the constraint of the `` single - valuedness boundary condition '' ( svbc ) as called by leggett  @xcite , while keeping the energy the same as that in the static case . to do this , adjustment on the wavefunction needs to be made in the exponentially vanishing regions , indeed as argued by leggett .",
    "the organization of the paper can be clearly seen in the section titles .",
    "as usual , consider a bose system in a container rotating with a angular velocity @xmath2 .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium is determined by the minimization of the free energy in the co - rotating frame of reference , in which the wall of the container is at rest . in this frame , the hamiltonian is @xmath3 \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\sum_{j\\neq k}v_{jk } , \\end{array } \\label{ha}\\ ] ] where the notations are standard , @xmath4 is the external potential , @xmath5 is the particle - particle interaction and is rotationally invariant . for basic mechanics and thermodynamics of a rotating body and the application to a bose system , we refer to the standard texts .",
    "@xcite but we draw attention to the point that for each particle , the radius vector @xmath6 , the canonical momentum @xmath7 , and the angular momentum @xmath8 are respectively the same in the laboratory frame and in the co - rotating frame . it is for this reason that @xmath9 can be re - written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 + ( 1/2)\\sum_{j\\neq k}v_{jk}\\ ] ] is the hamiltonian in the laboratory frame .",

    "@xcite as said above , the angular momentum and momentum are , respectively , the same in the laboratory frame and in the co - rotating frame .",

    "we believe that the centrifugal potential can not be neglected .",
    "as this formulation of superfluid density is very important and widely used , it may be worthwhile to rederive it without neglecting the centrifugal potential .",

    "our consideration is about a thin cylindrical bulk , @xmath170 . especially , the periodic boundary condition in coordinate @xmath171 should be taken into account in an essential way .",

    "iii and iv , from the presence of odlro , we make a general derivation of the most basic manifestation of superfluidity , namely the hess - fairbank effect or ncri , i.e. , the refusal of the bose system to follow the rotation of the container , by using a method of yang in treating superconductivity in a magnetic field .",
    "we also derive the quantization of angular momentum as a consequence of odlro , by borrowing a method of bloch in studying superconducting persistent current . in sec .",
    "v , we rederive the path integral formulation of the superfluid density without neglecting the centrifugal potential .    in secs .",
    "vi and vii , we consider the variational wavefunctions which have been used in solid helium calculations , namely , the hartree , the hartree - fock and the symmetrized nosanow - jastrow wavefunctions .",
    "the non - superfluidity in the hartree - fock wavefunctions was already noted by leggett from its disconnectivity .",
    "@xcite we show that there is no odlro in these trial wavefunctions , for both an infinite sample and that confined in a cylindrical annulus .",
    "moreover , by extending a method originally due to kohn in discussing electronic insulating states , we explicitly demonstrate that there is no ncri behavior in a commensurate quantum solid described by those trial wavefunctions , even if there exist large zero - point motion , finite overlap between wavepackets and exchange effect . in this argument ,",
    "the constraint of svbc in the angular direction is carefully taken into account .",
    "the explicit construction of the wavefunction under the rotation is consistent with the early arguments of leggett in terms of the connectivity properties .",
