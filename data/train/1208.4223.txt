    "in this work we consider the problem of a spin - half fermion gravitationally bound by a static , massive body described by a non - singular metric .",
    "we investigate the energy level spectrum of the particle in the limit that the metric exhibits a singularity .",
    "previously , we calculated the spectrum of scalar ( spin - zero ) particles bound by such objects  @xcite and found that it collapses to zero energy and becomes quasi - continuous in the singular limit .",
    "importantly , bound states with zero energy ( where the binding energy is equal in magnitude to the rest mass of the bound particle ) were found not to exist when the metric is not singular . here",
    "we calculate the spin-1/2 fermion energy level spectrum for three interior metrics describing the interior of the gravitating ( stationary ) body : the florides , schwarzschild , and soffel metrics , the latter so - named for its derivation and subsequent use in  @xcite . for each metric",

    "soffel spacetimes this limit is characterized by the approach of the schwarzschild radius @xmath0 towards the radius of the body @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the gravitational constant and @xmath3 is the mass of the central body ( black hole limit ) . in the case of the schwarzschild interior metric",
    "the singularity occurs for @xmath4 and corresponds to a infinite pressure at the origin , rather than the formation of an event horizon .",
    "our results show that , as in the scalar case , in the limit that the interior metric becomes singular , the ground state energy tends to zero ; that is , the binding energy tends to the rest mass energy of the bound particle .",
    "additionally , the energy spectrum becomes quasi - continuous in this limit .",
    "this means that one can not increase the strength of the central potential ( by increasing @xmath3 ) to lower a bound state level from the positive continuum to the negative : one can not reach the dirac sea to facilitate pair production .",
    "this suggests that pair - production can not occur in the field of such a static metric prior to the formation of a black hole .",
    "additionally , we present a discussion of the semi - classical approach to analyzing the properties of the level spectrum .",
    "it is shown that as the metric develops a singularity , all the semi - classical levels will tend to zero .",
    "this behaviour can also be understood from classical quantities such as time dilation on the interior .",

    "the metric on the exterior of a spherically symmetric non - rotating body of mass @xmath3 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the schwarzschild radius of the gravitating object .",

    "these results are compared with analytic calculations in later sections .      in the strong field limit ( as the metric becomes singular ) the wave function of a bound particle is contained entirely on the interior region of the body .",
    "the assumption of near complete containment on the interior allows one to perform all calculations using only the interior wave equation .",

    "we present calculations of the energy level spectrum for a massive spin-1/2 particle bound by a spherical static body .",
    "this is done by matching a suitable interior metric to the standard schwarzschild exterior metric and solving the dirac equation .",
    "numerical computation of the ground state energies of the particle shows that the existence of a zero energy bound state may only be possible in the limit that the interior metric develops a singularity . in the case of the florides and soffel metrics",
    "this corresponds to the black hole limit ; for the schwarzschild interior metric this singularity represents infinite pressure at the centre .",
    "this result is verified using an approximate analytical calculation . for the florides and soffel metrics",
    "it is seen that the entire bound state spectrum collapses to @xmath116 as @xmath117 : the energies and the intervals between the energy levels are proportional to @xmath118 and @xmath119 $ ] respectively .",

    "the singularity occurs for @xmath120 with the spectrum going as @xmath121 .",
    "what is clear is that for any fixed @xmath22 , @xmath85 , @xmath91 , the general form of the equations for @xmath122 in the florides and soffel cases ensures that the bound state energy collapses to zero in the limit @xmath123 .",
    "additionally , the form of the energy spectrum in the schwarzschild interior case results in the same collapse of the spectrum , except now the collapse occurs in the limit @xmath124 .",
    "this means that for spin-1/2 particles , as in the case of scalar particles , the event horizon singularity is not the only singularity that results in collapse of the spectrum to a gapless state  a pressure singularity gives the same result .",
    "therefore the bound state energy spectrum of an object with a near - singular metric reproduce those of an object that is close to the black hole limit .",
    "the existence of a bound state with zero energy is relevant to the phenomenon of particle pair production . due to quantum fluctuations ,",
    "particle anti - particle pairs are produced around a black hole and it is possible that one of the pair escapes the gravitational field yielding hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "other systems that give rise to pair production , also known as vacuum breakdown , include static and dynamic electromagnetic fields ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) and time - varying gravitational fields ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in the coulomb case",
    "it is clear that one of the pair must be repelled , since the pair have opposite charge . in the gravitational case , however , both particles will possess the same ` gravitational charge ' and thus will be attracted by the potential . in the black hole case",
    "the existence of the event horizon as a barrier facilitates one particle escaping to infinity as the other falls to the singularity .    for gapless energy states to exist in the metrics we have considered",
    ", the metric must become singular . for pair production with the ejection of one particle to infinity",
    "it is actually necessary to have a negative energy level @xmath125 . as a concrete example , compare the gravitational field case with the electrostatic potential case where pair creation is possible in a strong coulomb field @xmath126 .",
    "( for example , the ground state of an electron orbiting a finite - size nucleus reaches the lower continuum when @xmath127 @xcite ) . in the coulomb case",
    "we have @xmath128 in the wave equation .",
    "therefore , increasing the absolute value @xmath129 of the negative potential @xmath126 leads to the negative energy @xmath21 . in the gravitational field",
    "we have the field dependent term @xmath130 appearing as a multiplicative factor of the energy , rather than as a subtractive function , a situation that can not introduce negative energy bound states .",

    "<S> we present calculations of the ground state energy for three specific interior metrics ( florides , soffel and schwarzschild ) for which the spectrum collapses and becomes quasi - continuous in the singular metric limit . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of zero or negative energy states prior to this limit being reached prevents particle pair production occurring . therefore , in contrast to the coulomb case , no pairs are produced in the non - singular static metric . </S>",
    "<S> for the florides and soffel metrics the singularity occurs in the black hole limit , while for the schwarzschild interior metric it corresponds to infinite pressure at the centre . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the energy level spectrum is discussed in the context of the semi - classical approximation and using general properties of the metric . </S>"
