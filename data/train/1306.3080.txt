    "the problem of studying a charged particle beam focused by external electric or magnetic fields is important in many applications .",
    "the motion of such particle beams is governed by the interactions between the electric field generated by the particles themselves and by the external focusing electromagnetic field .",
    "the modelling framework consists in coupling a kinetic equation with maxwell equations . disregarding the collisions between particles ,",
    "the kinetic modelling is performed by means of the vlasov equation . in this paper",
    "we will consider only non - relativistic long and thin beams .",
    "therefore , instead of studying the phenomenon by means of the full vlasov - maxwell system , we can use its paraxial approximation ( see @xcite for mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of focused particle beams dynamics ) . in this framework , the effects of the self - consistent magnetic and electric fields can be both taken into account by solving a single poisson equation . finally , we are led to solve a two dimensional phase space vlasov - poisson system with a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this small parameter acts on the time variable ( in fact the longitudinal variable of a thin beam , see @xcite for details and physical meaning of the parameter ) , producing the highly oscillatory behaviour in phase space . in this framework ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a numerical scheme able to study efficiently the evolution of a beam over a large number of fast periods .",
    "although more precise alternatives exist , we have chosen in this work to perform the numerical solution of vlasov equation by particle methods , which consist in approximating the distribution function by a finite number of macroparticles .",
    "the trajectories of these particles are computed from the characteristic curves of the vlasov equation , whereas the self - consistent electric field is computed on a mesh in the physical space .",
    "this method allows to obtain satisfying results with a small number of particles ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to propose a new numerical method for solving the characteristic curves , or equivalently , for computing the macroparticles trajectories .",
    "namely , we are faced with solving the following stiff differential equation @xmath1 for several small values of the parameter @xmath0 and where @xmath2 represents a nonlinear term which plays the role of the self - consistent electric field .",
    "the difficulty arising in the numerical solution for this equation relies on the ability of the scheme to be uniformly stable and accurate when @xmath0 goes to zero .",
    "following the survey article @xcite , we are encouraged to use efficient numerical methods like exponential integrators in order to describe the dynamics of equation .",
    "the basic idea behind these methods is to make use of the solution s exact representation given by the variation - of - constants formula @xmath3 applying this formula from one time step to another has the merit to solve exactly the linear ( stiff ) part .",
    "classical numerical schemes fail to capture the stiff behaviour regardless of the size of the time step with respect to the small parameter .",
    "one may consult @xcite for construction , mathematical analysis and implementation of exponential integrators in the two classical types of stiff problems encapsulated in equation . as a specific implementation",
    ", one may cite @xcite , where , in the context of laser - plasma interactions , an exponential integrator is used for a particle - in - cell ( pic ) method in order to model the high - frequency plasma response .",
    "once the stiff part is exactly solved , one may use an exponential time differencing ( etd ) method ( see @xcite ) for the specific numerical treatement of the nonlinear term .",
    "the etd schemes turn out to outperform many other schemes when treating problems like ; see @xcite for comparisons of etd against the implicit - explicit method , the integrating factor method , etc .    in the present paper",
    "we construct and implement an exponential integrator in order to solve the characteristics of the highly oscillatory vlasov - poisson problem .",
    "the aim is to use a scheme with large time steps compared to the fast period that arises from the linear term without loosing the accuracy when the small parameter vanishes .",
    "the novelty of this method is in the numerical approximation of the integral term in .",
    "more precisely , when the time step is much larger than the rapid period , the idea of the algorithm is the following : we first finely solve the odes over one fast period by means of a high - order solver ( we have used explicit 4th order runge - kutta ) .",
    "then , thanks to formula , we may compute an approximation of the solution over a large integral number of periods .",
    "we have also found that using a more accurate period , instead of the period of the solution to the system without the nonlinear term , leads to more accurate simulations .",
    "in addition , we have checked if the scheme gives accurate solutions starting with an initial condition which lies on the slow manifold or not .",
    "we cite @xcite for a `` definition '' of the slow manifold : `` the slow manifold is that particular solution which varies only on the slow time scale ; the general solution to the ode contains fast oscillations also . ''",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "following @xcite , we briefly recall in section [ sec : axivp ] the paraxial approximation together with the axisymmetric beam assumption . in section [ sec",
    ": pic - vp ] we describe the pic method for the vlasov - poisson system in which we are interested .",
    "then , section [ sec : eipic ] is devoted to the construction of the new numerical scheme as an exponential integrator for solving the time - stepping part of the pic algorithm .",
    "eventually , in section [ sec : val - numerics ] , we implement and test our method on several test cases related to the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "the paraxial approximation relies on a scaled vlasov - poisson system in a phase space of dimension four , @xmath4 for space variable @xmath5 and @xmath4 for velocity variable @xmath6 .",
    "this simplified model of the full vlasov - maxwell system is particularly adapted to the study of long and thin beams of charged particles and it describes their evolution in the plane transverse to their direction of propagation .",
    "subject of many research investigations , the paraxial model was derived in a number of papers , see e.g. @xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in solving numerically a paraxial model with some additional hypotheses , see below .",
    "the solution of system is represented by a beam of particles in phase space .",
    "the beam evolves by rotating around the origin in the phase space , and in long times a bunch forms around the center of the beam from which filaments of particles are going out .",
    "these filaments are difficult to capture with classical numerical methods .",
    "we now introduce the paraxial model that we aim to solve . in the additional axisymmetric beam assumption ( i.e. invariant beam under rotation in @xmath7 for @xmath5 ) , we are led to change the @xmath5 coordinate in the polar frame .",
    "we thus write the model in polar coordinates @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is such that @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". then we use new velocity variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 . assuming in addition , as in @xcite",
    ", that @xmath16 is concentrated in angular momentum , i.e. @xmath17 , the paraxial model becomes @xmath18 where the external force @xmath19 writes @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 some @xmath23-periodic function with zero mean value . in this paper",
    "we assume that there is no time oscillation in the external field but only the strong uniform focusing .",
    "we thus take @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the vlasov - poisson system in which we are interested writes @xmath26 in order to test the numerical method that we propose , we first consider two numerically simpler test cases where the electric field is not issued from poisson equation , but it has analytical forms : in the first case @xmath27 and in the second one @xmath28 . unlike the second case , for the first one , we can analytically compute the solution to ( a ) .",
    "we solve the vlasov - poisson system by using a particle - in - cell ( pic ) method @xcite .",
    "we thus introduce the following dirac mass sum approximation of @xmath16 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of macroparticles and @xmath31 is the position in phase space of macroparticle @xmath32 moving along a characteristic curve of equation ( a ) .",
    "therefore , the problem is to find the positions and velocities @xmath33 at time @xmath34 from their values at time @xmath35 , by solving @xmath36 in this case , the standard pic algorithm writes as follows : ( 1 ) deposit particles on a spatial grid , leading to the grid density ; ( 2 ) solve poisson equation on the grid , leading to the grid electric field ; ( 3 ) interpolate the grid electric field in each particle ; ( 4 ) push particles with the previously obtained electric field .",
    "the first three steps are classically treated .",
    "the first one deals with the computing of the grid density by convoluting @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 with a first order spline ( this corresponds to the cloud - in - cell method in @xcite ) . then , we solve poisson equation ( b ) on a uniform one - dimensional grid by using finite differences .",
    "in our case this amounts to only discretize some space integral .",
    "we have done this by using the trapezoidal rule . as for the third step",
    ", we used the same convolution function as for the deposition step in order to get the particle electric field ( this corresponds to a linear interpolation of the grid electric field on each cell ) .",
    "eventually , the major issue is the fourth step of the pic algorithm , consisting in the numerical integration of system .",
    "here is the main focus of this paper , taking into account that we want to propose a stable and accurate scheme using large time steps with respect to the fast oscillation . to this end",
    ", we introduce in the next section a method based on exponential time differencing .",
    "we now describe the exponential numerical integrator that we have implemented to solve the fourth step of the pic algorithm .",
    "we first write down the exponential time differencing ( etd ) method in the case of the stiff ode system we are interested in . then , in section [ sec : etd - pic ] , we develop an algorithm based on the exponential time differencing in the framework of the pic method .",
    "the so - called exponential time differencing scheme arose originally in the field of computational electrodynamics but has been reinvented many times over the years ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we take details of the ideas behind the various etd schemes from the comprehensive paper by cox and matthews @xcite .",
    "recall the stiff system of odes that we have to solve : @xmath39 with some initial condition @xmath40 . in this section",
    "we assume that the electric field @xmath41 is given .",
    "as exposed in @xcite , the stiffness comes from the two scales on which the solution evolves : the rapid oscillations due to the linear term and a slower evolution due to the nonlinear ( electric ) term .",
    "thus , while any explicit scheme is limited to a small time step , of order @xmath0 , a fully implicit one requires nonlinear problems to be solved and is therefore slow . a suitable time - stepping scheme for should be able to avoid the small time steps when treating the stiffness .",
    "the essence of the etd methods is to solve the stiff linear part exactly and to derive appropriate approximations when integrating numerically the slower nonlinear term @xcite .    to derive the exponential time differencing ( etd ) method for this system",
    "we first apply @xmath42 to and then integrate the obtained equation from @xmath35 to @xmath43 to deduce that @xmath44 where @xmath45 this formula is exact .",
    "in addition , it is also useful to write by replacing @xmath46 by any couple @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath49 now the main question is how to derive approximations to the integral term in .",
    "all the etd schemes are results of this process . in this spirit",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that etd methods can be extended to any order by using multistep or runge - kutta methods and explicit formulae for such arbitrary order etd methods were derived .",
    "in particular , explicit coefficients for etd runge - kutta methods of order up to four have been computed .",
    "the authors also illustrated on several odes and pdes that etd is superior over the integrating factor and implicit - explicit methods , two other classical schemes able to avoid the small time step .",
    "nevertheless , in the form written in @xcite , a high - order etd scheme ( e.g. etdrk4 ) suffers from numerical instability as explained in @xcite .",
    "the problem has been solved in @xcite by using a contour integral method for evaluating the coefficients .",
    "then , this modified etdrk4 scheme has been tested in @xcite against five other 4th order schemes on several pdes , and etdrk4 has been found the best in terms of errors .",
    "these results encouraged us to use an etd scheme in order to solve stiff odes .    in this paper",
    "we do not use a high - order etd method as described in the references above but merely the formula for justifying the derivation of algorithm [ algo - time ] .",
    "more precisely , we adopt a different approach for approximating the integral term in , which is justified by the remark in the next paragraph and by our aim to use very large time steps compared to the fast oscillations , say @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "this is the core of the method described in the following section .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new numerical scheme for solving some stiff ( highly oscillatory ) differential equation .",
    "this scheme is based on exponential time differencing and can accurately handle large time steps with respect to the fast oscillation of the solution .",
    "it is applied in the framework of a particle - in - cell method for solving some vlasov - poisson equation .",
    "since the numerical results are encouraging , several ways to explore in the future may be usefull to improve some points in the scheme development .",
    "we have seen that the use of @xmath52 as fast time within the first step of algorithm [ algo - time ] may lead to an unstable simulation .",
    "in addition , even in a stable simulation , the use of the particles mean period gives smaller errors than those obtained with @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we think it is important to find theoretically a more accurate approximation of the fast time .    it will be interesting to see if our numerical scheme preserves the two - scale asymptotic limit , meaning that @xmath53 in the numerical scheme leads to a consistent discretization of the two - scale limit model .",
    "this remark is based on the fact that the etd discretization we have used is very close to an explicit discretization of the limit model in theorem 1.1 of @xcite ."
