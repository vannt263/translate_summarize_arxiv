    "although more systematic observations are needed to define the precise pulsational periods of hd  35929 and v351  ori , the available data already provide some preliminary constraints on their position in the h - r diagram , stellar mass and evolutionary state . as remarked by the referee ,",

    "in this case , the best choice would be a post - ms model of a 2.7  @xmath16 star with @xmath22 and @xmath23  k , pulsating in the so mode .",

    "[ hr_hd ] .",
    "although only few specific studies exist on hd  35929 , some evidence supports the fact that hd  35929 is a young star associated with the ori ob-1c association .",
    "for example , malfait et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have discussed the infrared excess observed toward this star , whereas miroshnichenko et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have suggested that the star might be in a transition phase between a pms herbig ae star and a @xmath24 pictoris - type object .",
    "we also note that the pulsational character ( period and h - r diagram location ) of hd  35929 is similar in many respects to that of the well known herbig ae star hr  5999 . from these considerations ,",
    "we favor the conclusion that hd  35929 is a pms star with a mass in the narrow range 3.4 - 3.8  @xmath16 , pulsating in the fo or so .",
    "+ finally we note that if the strmgren indices [ c1 ] and [ m1 ] measured for this star are taken into account , together with published values for the @xmath25 index , one derives an effective temperature @xmath26 and a luminosity varying between 26 and 36 @xmath27 .",
    "this means that according to the strmgren photometry , hd35929 should be located on a @xmath28 evolutionary track and the period based on present data would be too long even for a pulsation in the fundamental mode . a possible explanation for this inconsistency could be that hd35929 is also a rapid rotator ( @xmath1150 km s@xmath3 ) so that the assumption of radial pulsation could be not completely correct .",

    "[ hr_v351 ] shows the location of v351  ori in the h - r diagram . here , the uncertainty on the luminosity is larger than for hd  35929 , because of the distance ambiguity .",
    "the lower value corresponds to the minimum distance of 260 pc given in the hipparcos catalogue ( van den ancker et al .",
    "the upper limit ( inverted triangle ) assumes that v351  ori is located in the orion molecular cloud at a distance of 460  pc .",
    "the dashed box corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath31 dex in @xmath32 . finally , the filled circle marks the position estimated by van den ancker et al . ( 1996 ) with the associated error bar . as already pointed out",
    ", present data for v351  ori suggest a pulsation period of @xmath33 . + using the constraints provided by this preliminary period and by the topology of the instability strip , we have computed linear nonadiabatic models to find the best set of stellar parameters that reproduce the pulsation of v351  ori .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ hr_v351 ] and the stellar parameters are given in table  2 .",
    "the solutions yield a stellar mass of 1.85 m@xmath2 or 2.15 m@xmath2 , respectively , pulsating in the so ( open square in fig .  [ hr_v351 ] ) , or the third overtone ( to ) mode ( open circle in fig .  [ hr_v351 ] . for lower modes , the luminosity of the model would be lower than the estimated lower limit for v351  ori , whereas higher modes are probably excluded by the closeness of the observational box to the second overtone blue boundary and we did not consider their occurrence .",
    "these solutions would tend to favor a distance of v351  ori , smaller than that of the young stellar population of the orion complex .",
    "+ recently , kovalchuk & pugach ( 1998 ) have argued on the basis of several peculiar photospheric properties that v351  ori is in fact more evolved than previously thought and conclude that this star does not belong to the group of herbig stars . from fig .",
    "[ hr_v351 ] , we see that the the post - ms track of a 2 m@xmath2 star intersects the corresponding pms track at about the position of the best pulsational models . the degeneracy of the tracks does not allow to use the pulsational analysis to discriminate between the two evolutionary phases . however , this uncertainty would disappear if the distance of v351  ori were the same as that of the orion population stars . then",
    ", the difference between the pre- and post - ms tracks would be large enough that the period analysis would rule out one of the two solutions .",
    "future studies of v351  ori should address this important aspect .",
