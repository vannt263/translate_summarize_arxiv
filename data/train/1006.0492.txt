    "high precision wavelength calibrators for astrophysical spectrographs will be key components of new precision radial velocity ( rv ) observations , including the search for earth - like extra - solar planets ( exoplanets )  @xcite and direct observation of cosmological acceleration  @xcite .",
    "recent work has demonstrated the potential of octave - spanning femtosecond laser frequency combs  @xcite (  astro - combs \" ) to serve as wavelength calibrators for astrophysical spectrographs providing rv sensitivity down to 1  cm / s  @xcite .",
    "exoplanet searches place stringent demands upon such calibrators .",
    "for example , the rv amplitude of the reflex motion of a solar - mass star induced by an earth - mass planet in an orbit within the habitable zone is about 10  cm / s .",
    "the current state of the art astrophysical spectrograph , harps , has demonstrated stellar rv sensitivity @xmath2  cm / s  @xcite , largely limited by its thorium argon lamp calibrator  @xcite .",
    "these calibrators are limited by their unevenness in line spacing and intensity as well as the slow variation of their line wavelengths with time .",
    "an astro - comb provides emission lines with uniform intensity and controllable spacing , which can be referenced to atomic frequency standards and the global positioning system ( gps ) , yielding excellent long - term stability and reproducibility .    to date",
    ", astro - combs consist of a combination of an octave - spanning femtosecond laser frequency comb ( source comb ) and a fabry - prot cavity ( fpc ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : astro - comb setup ] .",
    "spectral lines generated by the source comb are spaced by the pulse repetition rate ( @xmath3 ) , currently @xmath4  ghz , which results in a line spacing too dense to be resolved by broadband astrophysical spectrographs  @xcite .",
    "the fpc serves as a mode filter with a free spectral range ( fsr ) set to an integer multiple of the repetition rate , fsr=@xmath5 , with @xmath6 , depending on the spectrograph resolution .",
    "ideally , the fpc passes only every @xmath7 source comb spectral line , providing thousands of calibration lines well matched to a practical spectrograph s resolution , with fractional frequency uncertainty limited only by the stability of the rf reference used to stabilize the source comb and fpc .",
    "this frequency uncertainty can be @xmath8 using commonly available atomic clock technology , which corresponds to @xmath9 khz uncertainty in the optical frequency or 0.3 cm / s in rv precision .",
    "however , because the spectrograph fails to resolve neighboring source comb lines , finite suppression of these neighboring lines by the fpc affects the lineshape and potentially the centroid of measured astro - comb lines .",
    "for example , in the results presented here , source comb modes neighboring the astro - comb line , with intensities after passing through the fpc that differ by 0.1% of the main astro - comb peak , shift the measured line centroid by 1 mhz , which corresponds to an rv systematic error of 1 m / s . in practice ,",
    "such systematic rv shifts are inevitable over spectral bandwidths of 1000    due to the dispersive properties of the mirrors of the fpc .",
    "although these systematic shifts can be very stable over timescales of years , the correction of such shifts is crucial to high accuracy astrophysical spectroscopy .        in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate an _ in - situ _ technique to determine the systematic shifts of astro - comb lines due to fpc dispersion , which can be applied at a telescope - based spectrograph to enable wavelength calibration accuracy better than 10 cm / s . by measuring the intensity of astro - comb lines as the fpc length",
    "is adjusted , we determine ( i ) the offset of each fpc resonance from the nearest source comb line ; ( ii ) fpc finesse as a function of wavelength ; and ( iii ) the intensity of the astro - comb lines and their neighboring ( normally suppressed ) source comb lines .",
    "these parameters can be determined quickly and reliably over the full 1000    bandwidth of the astro - comb with only @xmath10 measurements at slightly different fpc lengths , and can be performed quickly ( @xmath11 hour ) and reliably . the measurement has also been performed with a lower resolution commercial optical spectrum analyzer with consistent results .",
    "the astro - comb line characterization technique presented here builds on past work in which femtosecond lasers coupled to swept cavities were used to study both the medium in which the cavity was immersed and the cavity mirrors  @xcite .",
    "imperfect suppression of unwanted source comb lines , e.g. , due to finite fpc finesse , affects the astro - comb lineshape observed on a spectrograph .",
    "the lineshape can be modeled with knowledge of the fpc properties including mirror reflectivity and round trip phase delay .",

    "the phase delay may be expressed as  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the length of the cavity , @xmath20 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath21 is the refractive index of the medium inside the cavity ( air , vacuum , etc . ) at optical frequency @xmath14 , and @xmath22 is the frequency - dependent group delay of the mirrors . the first term in parentheses in eq .",

    "slight wedging ( for example , 0.5@xmath70 ) of the substrates will eliminate these variations . after fitting the phase deviation with a sixth order polynomial , we compared our result with the phase deviation derived from a model of air dispersion  @xcite and the mirror phase delay measured with a white light interferometer ( fig .",

    "the frequency shift in an astro - comb line centroid due to variations of neighboring source comb line intensities at the 1% level is thus @xmath76  khz or 7  cm / s .",
    "note that we do not expect neighboring source comb lines to differ as much as 1% ; also a gaussian distribution of comb - line intensities will average away much of this astro - comb centroid frequency shift .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that a double pass configuration through the same fpc  @xcite , moderately higher fpc finesse ( @xmath77 ) , a higher repetition rate for the source comb ( @xmath78  ghz ) , or more precise measurements of line to line intensity variations will be required to assure 1  cm / s accuracy in practical astro - comb calibrators . in fig .",
    "[ fig : correction ] , we show the shift of the estimated systematic error in the wavelength calibration of tres as a function of wavelength , when using our current astro - comb as the calibration reference , if the effect of nearest suppressed source - comb lines are not included in the fit model . with proper inclusion of such effects ,",
    "residual uncertainty in the wavelength calibration is at the 1  cm / s level .",
    "thus we conclude that while astro - comb line frequency shifts caused by mirror dispersion and resultant wavelength dependence of fpc finesse and phase deviation can be absorbed into the wavelength calibration if reproducibility is all that is desired , at the few cm / s level these corrections must be applied to the spectrograph calibration to achieve accurate stellar radial velocity measurements .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated an _ in - situ _ method to determine systematic shifts of astro - comb spectral lines due to imperfect suppression of source comb lines by the fabry - pert filter cavity ( fpc ) .",
    "this method involves measurement of fpc finesse as well as the phase deviation of all astro - comb lines over a bandwidth of 1000   .",
    "such measurements can be performed at a telescope with either an astrophysical spectrograph or a commercial optical spectrum analyzer of lower resolution . from the measured phase deviation ,",
    "the dispersion of the fpc is derived and found to be consistent with that calculated from the intra - cavity air dispersion and the group delay dispersion of the fpc mirrors .",
    "applying resultant corrections for shifts in the centroid of astro - comb spectral lines allows us to model the astro - comb spectrum as measured on an astrophysical spectrograph with accuracy to better than 0.1  mhz , i.e. , 10 cm / s for measurement of a stellar radial velocity .",
    "such high accuracy is important for many applications of astro - comb wavelength calibrators , such as the search for habitable exoplanets , direct measurement of the expansion of the universe , and searches for a temporal variation of physical constants ."
