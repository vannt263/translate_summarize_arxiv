    "the _ teichmller flow _ @xmath2 acts on components of strata in the moduli space of area one abelian or quadratic differentials for a non - exceptional surface @xmath1 of finite type .",
    "this flow has many properties which resemble the properties of an anosov flow .",
    "for example , there is a pair of transverse invariant foliations , and there is an invariant mixing borel probability measure @xmath3 in the lebesgue measure class which is absolutely continuous with respect to these foliations , with conditional measures which are uniformly expanded and contracted by the flow @xcite .",
    "this measure is even exponentially mixing , i.e. exponential decay of correlations for hlder observables holds true @xcite .",
    "the entropy @xmath4 of the lebesgue measure @xmath3 is the supremum of the topological entropies of the restriction of @xmath2 to compact invariant sets @xcite . for strata of abelian differentials",
    ", @xmath3 is the unique invariant measure of maximal entropy @xcite .",
    "the goal of this note is to extend further the analogy between the teichmller flow on components of strata and anosov flows .",
    "an anosov flow @xmath5 on a compact manifold @xmath6 admits a unique borel probability measure @xmath7 of maximal entropy .",
    "this measure can be obtained as follows @xcite .",
    "every periodic orbit @xmath8 of @xmath5 of prime period @xmath9 supports a unique @xmath5-invariant borel measure @xmath10 of total mass @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath12 is the topological entropy of @xmath5 then @xmath7 is the ( unique ) weak limit of the sequence of measures @xmath13 as @xmath14 . in particular",
    ", the number of periodic orbits of period at most @xmath15 is asymptotic to @xmath16 as @xmath14 .    for any connected component @xmath0 of a stratum of abelian or quadratic differentials the @xmath2-invariant lebesgue measure @xmath3 on @xmath0",
    "can be obtained in the same way . for a precise formulation ,",
    "we say that a family @xmath17 of finite borel measures on the moduli space @xmath18 of area one abelian differentials or on the moduli space @xmath19 of area one quadratic differentials _ converges weakly _ to @xmath3 if for every continuous function @xmath20 on @xmath18 or on @xmath19 with compact support we have @xmath21 let @xmath22 be the set of all periodic orbits for @xmath2 contained in @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath23 let @xmath9 be the prime period of @xmath8 and denote by @xmath10 the @xmath2-invariant lebesgue measure on @xmath8 of total mass @xmath11 .",
    "we show    for every component @xmath0 of a stratum in the moduli space of abelian or quadratic differentials the measures @xmath24 converge as @xmath14 weakly to the lebesgue measure on @xmath0 .",
    "the theorem implies that as @xmath14 , the number of periodic orbits in @xmath0 of period at most @xmath15 is asymptotically not smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "however , since the closure in @xmath19 of a component @xmath0 of a stratum is non - compact , we do not obtain a precise asymptotic growth rate for all periodic orbits in @xmath0 .",
    "namely , there may be a set of periodic orbits in @xmath0 whose growth rate exceeds @xmath4 and which eventually exit every compact subset of @xmath19 .",
    "for periodic orbits in the open principal stratum , eskin and mirzakhani @xcite showed that the asymptotic growth rate of periodic orbits for the teichmller flow which lie deeply in the cusp of moduli space is strictly smaller than the entropy @xmath4 , and they calculate the asymptotic growth rate of all periodic orbits .",
    "eskin , mirzakhani and rafi @xcite also announced the analogous result for any component of any stratum .",
    "the proof of the above theorem uses ideas which were developed by margulis for hyperbolic flows ( see @xcite for an account with comments ) .",
    "this strategy is by now standard , and the main task is to overcome the difficulty of absence of hyperbolicity for the teichmller flow in the thin part of moduli space and the absence of nice product coordinates near a boundary point of a stratum .",
    "absence of hyperbolicity in the thin part of moduli space is dealt with using the curve graph similar to the strategy developed in @xcite .",
    "integration of the hodge norm as discussed in @xcite and some standard ergodic theory is also used .",
    "relative homology coordinates @xcite define local product structures for strata .",
    "these coordinates do no extend in a straightforward way to points in the boundary of the stratum . in the case of the principal stratum",
    ", however , product coordinates about boundary points can be obtained by simply writing a quadratic differential as a pair of its vertical and horizontal measured geodesic lamination .",
    "our approach is to show that there is a similar picture for strata . to this end",
    ", we use coordinates for strata based on train tracks which will be used in other contexts as well .",
    "the construction of these coordinates is carried out in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the tools developed in sections 3 and 4 are used in section 5 to show that a weak limit @xmath7 of the measures @xmath25 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , with radon nikodym derivative bounded from above by one . in section 6 the proof of the theorem",
