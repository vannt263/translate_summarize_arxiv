    "molecular sieves are crystalline materials with open framework structures . of the almost two billion pounds of molecular sieves produced in the last decade ,",
    "1.4 billion pounds were used in detergents , 160 millions pounds as catalysts and about 70 millions pounds as adsorbents or desiccants .",
    "@xcite    zeolites represent a large fraction of known molecular sieves .",
    "these are all aluminosilicates with well - defined pore structures . in these crystalline materials , the metal atoms ( classically , silicon or aluminum ) are surrounded by four oxygen anions to form an approximate tetrahedron .",
    "these tetrahedra then stack in regular arrays such that channels and cages are formed .",
    "the possible ways for the stacking to occur is virtually unlimited , and hundreds of unique structures are known .",
    "@xcite    the channels ( or pores ) of zeolites generally have cross section somewhat larger than a benzene molecule .",
    "some zeolites have one - dimensional channels parallel to one another and no connecting cages large enough for guest molecules to cross from one channel to the next .",
    "the one - dimensional nature leads to extraordinary effects on the kinetic properties of these materials .",
    "molecules move in a concerted fashion , as they are unable to pass each other in the channels .",
    "these structures are modeled by one - dimensional systems called single - file systems where particles are not able to pass each other .",
    "a particle can only move to an adjacent site if that site is not occupied .",
    "this process of single - file diffusion has different characteristics than ordinary diffusion which affects the nature of both transport and conversion by chemical reactions . for single - file diffusion ,",
    "the mean - square displacement of a particular particle is proportional to the square - root of time @xmath0 where f is the single - file mobility .",
    "@xcite this is in contrast to normal diffusion , where mean - square displacement is directly proportional to time .",
    "a variety of approaches have been used to describe the movement of the particles in single - file systems , most of them concentrated on the role of the single - file diffusion process .",
    "molecular dynamic(md ) studies of diffusion in zeolites have become increasingly popular with the advent of powerful computers and improved algorithms . in a md simulation",
    "the movement is calculated by computing all forces exerted upon the individual particles .",
    "md results have been found to match experimental observations of single - file diffusion for systems with one type of molecule without conversion and with very short pores .",
    "@xcite because a molecule can move to the right or to the left neighboring site only if this site is free , md simulations under heavy load circumstances require a high computational effort for particles that hardly move . however , the level of detail provided by md simulations is not always necessary .",
    "thus , deterministic models are used also but they are mainly focused on dynamic and steady - state information of short pore systems .",
    "@xcite several researchers  @xcite used a stochastic approach , i.e. , dynamic monte carlo(dmc ) , to determine the properties of single - file systems . in dmc reactions",
    "can be included .",
    "the rates of the reactions determine the probability with which different configurations are generated and how fast ( at what moment in time ) new configurations are generated .",
    "the most severe limitation of the dmc method arises when the reaction types in a model can be partitioned into 2 classes with vastly different reaction rates . in this case , extremly large amounts of computer time are required to simulate a reasonable number of chemical reactions .",
    "however , in general the system can be simulated for much longer times than with md .",
    "all the previous references put the emphasis on the transport properties of adsorbed molecules as the important factor in separation and reaction processes that take place within zeolites and other shape - selective microporous catalysts .",
    "r@xmath1denbeck and k@xmath2rger  @xcite solved numerically the principal dependence of steady - state properties such as concentration profiles and the residence time distribution of the particles , on the system parameters for sufficiently short pores . in multiple papers ,",

    "@xcite used dynamic monte carlo to show different predictions about single - file transport and direct measurements of intercage hopping ion strongly adsorbing quest - zeolite systems .",
    "saravanan and auerbach  @xcite studied a lattice model of self - diffusion in nanopores , to explore the influence of loading , temperature and adsorbate coupling on benzene self - diffusion in na - x and na - y zeolites .",
    "they applied mean - field(mf ) approximation for a wide set of parameters , and derived an analytical diffusion theory to calculate diffusion coefficients for various loadings at fixed temperature , denoted as `` diffusion isotherms '' .",
    "they found that diffusion isotherms can be segregated into subcritical and supercritical regimes , depending upon the system temperature relative to the critical temperature of the confined fluid .",
    "supercritical systems exhibit three characteristic loading dependencies of diffusion depending on the degree of degeneracy of the lattice while the subcritical diffusion systems are dominated by cluster formation .",
    "coppens and bell  @xcite studied the influence of occupancy and pore network topology on tracer and transport diffusion in zeolites .",
    "they found that diffusion in zeolites strongly depends on the pore network topology and on the types and fractions of the different adsorption sites .",
    "mf calculations can quickly estimate the diffusivity , although large deviations from the dmc values occur when long - time correlations are present at higher occupancies , when the site distribution is strongly heterogeneous and the connectivity of the network low .",
    "few researchers included also reactivity in single - file systems .",
    "tsikoyannis and wei  @xcite considered a reactive one - dimensional system with all the sites reactive in order to get more information about the reactivity and selectivity in one - dimensional systems .",
    "they used a markov pure jump processes approach to model zeolitic diffusion and reaction as a sequence of elementary jump events taking place in a finite periodic lattice .",
    "monte carlo and approximate analytical solutions to the derived master equation were developed to examine the effect of intracrystalline occupancy on the macroscopic diffusional behavior of the system .",
    "one conclusion was that better results using analytical approach can be obtained compared to dmc simulation results by including more correlations between neighboring sites in regions of the systems with high occupancy gradients and less correlations in regions with low and no occupancy gradients .",
    "starting from wei  @xcite results about correlations in single - file systems , okino and snurr  @xcite used a deterministic model where each site was assumed to have equal activity towards reaction .",
    "doublet approximation was found to overpredict the occupancy of the sites and the increasing mobility raised the concentration of reactants in the pore .",
    "using dmc simulations we have observed that even for infinitely fast diffusion , we still have single - file effects in the system . instead of focusing on diffusion at different occupancies of the system ,",
    "we therefore concentrate in this paper on the reactivity of the system , studying the reactivity of the system for different sets of kinetic parameters , the length of the pipe and the distribution of the reactive sites .",
    "we analyse the situations when mf gives good results and when mf results deviate strongly from the dmc simulations .",
    "we investigate the effect of the various model assumptions made about diffusion , adsorption / desorption , and reaction on the overall behavior of the system .",
