    "the motivation for coupled atomistic / continuum models of solids is that the accuracy of an atomistic model is often only needed in localized regions of the computational domain , but a coarse - grained continuum model is necessary for the simulation of large enough systems to include long - range effects  @xcite .",
    "the force - based approach has become very popular because it provides a particularly simple and accurate @xcite method for coupling two physics models without the development of an accurate hybrid coupling energy .",
    "it operates by creating disjoint subdomains in which the equilibrium equations at each degree of freedom are obtained by assigning forces directly from one of the physics models .",
    "in addition to coupling atomistic and continuum models , such an approach has also been found to be attractive , for example , in the coupling of regions modeled by quantum mechanics to regions modeled by molecular mechanics , since accurate hybrid coupling energies require an interfacial region that is too computationally demanding for the quantum mechanics model  @xcite .",
    "the force - based quasicontinuum ( qcf ) approximation is attractive because of its simple and efficient implementation and because it is the only known pointwise consistent quasicontinuum ( qc ) approximation for coupling a general atomistic model with a cauchy - born continuum model  @xcite . by _",
    "consistent _ we mean that the absence of ghost forces under homogeneous deformations .",
    "its main drawback is that it results in a non - conservative force field  @xcite , that is , the qcf forces are not compatible with any energy functional .",
    "several creative attempts have been made to develop hybrid coupling energies that satisfy the patch test ( there are no resultant forces under uniform strain )  @xcite , which is a weaker compatibility condition than pointwise consistency and leads to reduced accuracy .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the force - based quasicontinuum approximation ( qcf ) , @xmath0 but , for simplicity , we will focus mainly on its linearization about a reference state , @xmath1 see section [ sec : model ] for the precise definitions .",
    "recent analyses of the linearized qcf operator  @xcite have identified both further advantages as well as disadvantages of the force - based coupling approach .",
    "in addition to being non - symmetric , which is related to the fact that @xmath2 is non - conservative , the linearized qcf operator also suffers from a lack of positive - definiteness  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we show that this somewhat unusual stability property of the operator @xmath3 presents a challenge for the development of efficient and stable iterative solution methods that is overcome by the gmres methods we propose .",
    "we consider three related approaches to the development of iterative methods for the qcf equilibrium equations  .",
    "a popular approach @xcite to solve the force - based equations   modifies a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm by replacing the univariate optimization of an energy , used for step size selection  @xcite , with the computation of a step size such that the residual is ( approximately ) orthogonal to the current search direction .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : modifiedcg ] that , due to the indefiniteness of @xmath3 , this method is not numerically stable for our qcf model problem .",
    "the second approach we consider is the nonlinear splitting @xmath4 + \\nabla \\e ( y)\\ ] ] to construct the nonlinear iteration equation @xmath5 .\\ ] ] the iterative solution of the nonlinear splitting method   can then be obtained from the minimization of the sum of @xmath6 and the potential energy of the dead load @xmath7 where @xmath8 that is , @xmath9 for this approach to be accurate under conditions near the formation or motion of defects , care must be taken to ensure that the energy @xmath6 accurately reproduces the stability of the approximated atomistic system .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : gfc_method ] that using the original quasicontinuum energy @xmath10 defined in , which results in the ghost force correction ( gfc ) scheme , does not reliably reproduce the stability of the atomistic system  @xcite and can give a reduced critical strain for a lattice instability .",
    "to develop the final approach , we recall the newton method @xmath11=r^{(n)},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the residual @xmath13 the gmres methods proposed and analyzed in this paper apply to the solution of the linear newton equations or their approximations .",
    "since the qcf equilibrium equations are generally solved along a quasi - static process  @xcite , a good initial guess is usually available and a small number of iterations of the outer iteration is sufficient to maintain stability and accuracy .",
    "we begin in sections [ sec : model ] and [ sec : qcf ] by introducing the most important quasicontinuum approximations and outlining their stability properties , which are mostly straightforward generalizations of results from @xcite .",
    "we also present careful numerical studies of the spectral properties of @xmath3 which are particularly useful for the analysis of krylov subspace methods in section [ sec : gmres ] .    in section  [ sec : nonlinear ] , we revisit the _ ghost force correction ( gfc ) scheme _  @xcite which , as was pointed out in  @xcite , can be understood as a linear stationary iterative method   for solving the qcf equilibrium equations .",
    "we show that , even though the qcf method itself is stable up to a critical strain @xmath14 , the gfc scheme becomes unstable at a significantly reduced strain for our model problem .",
    "this leads us to conclude ( though the simple examples we analyze here can only be first indicators ) that the gfc method is not universally reliable near instabilities .",
    "we note , however , that the gfc method can be expected on the basis of both theoretical  @xcite and computational results  @xcite to be more accurate near instabilities than the use of the uncorrected qce energy @xmath15 as explained in section  [ sec : gfc_method ] .",
    "numerical results have also shown that the gfc method can give an accurate approximation of critical loads if the atomistic - to - continuum interface is sufficiently far from the defect  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 16 ) , at a cost of a larger atomistic region than likely required by the accuracy of the qcf approximation .",
    "the quasi - nonlocal energy @xmath16 of  @xcite given by   is a more reliable and accurate energy to use in the splitting iteration  .",
    "it has been shown to reproduce the atomistic stability of one - dimensional atomistic systems with next - nearest neighbor interactions  @xcite , and the error for multi - dimensional atomistic systems is likely to be acceptable if the longer - range interactions decay sufficiently fast .",
    "the splitting iteration   can then be used as part of a continuation algorithm for a quasi - static process  @xcite that provides the reliable detection of the stability of the atomistic system  @xcite as well as the improved accuracy for the deformation given by the force - based approximation  @xcite .",
    "we conclude section  [ sec : nonlinear ] by proving the numerical instability of the modified conjugate algorithm  @xcite for our qcf model problem .",
    "we present these two examples to demonstrate the subtleties in designing an iterative algorithm for the solution of the qcf system and to underscore the need for thorough numerical analysis in the development of stable and efficient iterative methods for the qcf system .",
    "we conclude by considering in section [ sec : gmres ] the generalized minimal residual method ( gmres ) for the solution of the indefinite and non - symmetric qcf system .",
    "we provide an analysis of basic as well as preconditioned gmres methods .",
    "we find in this section that a non - standard preconditioned gmres method , based on the discrete @xmath17-inner product , appears to have excellent stability properties up to the critical strain @xmath14 and a more reliable termination criterion .",
    "in this section , we give a condensed description of the prototype qc approximations and their stability properties .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "many details of this section can be skipped on a first reading and only referred back to when required .      before we introduce the atomistic model and its qc approximations , we define the notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
