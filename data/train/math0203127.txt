    "suppose @xmath4 is a connected closed manifold equipped with a cubical cell structure .",
    "( in other words , @xmath4 is homeomorphic to a regular cell complex in which each @xmath5-dimensional cell is combinatorially isomorphic to a @xmath5-dimensional cube . )",
    "it turns out that there is a rich class of examples of such manifolds satisfying the following three properties .    1 .",
    "there is a group @xmath6 of symmetries of the cellulation such that the action of @xmath6 on the vertex set is simply transitive and such that the stabilizer of each edge is cyclic of order @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   in the dual cell structure on @xmath4",
    "each top - dimensional cell is combinatorially isomorphic to some given simple convex polytope , for example , to a permutohedron or an associahedron .",
    "( such a top - dimensional dual cell will be called a `` tile '' . )",
    "the natural piecewise euclidean metric on @xmath4 ( in which each combinatorial cube is isometric to a regular cube in euclidean space ) is nonpositively curved .",
    "it follows from ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) that the universal cover @xmath8 is homeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "the cubical cell structure on @xmath4 lifts to a cellulation of @xmath8 as does the dual cell structure .",
    "although these two cell structures on @xmath4 ( the cubical one and its dual ) carry exactly the same combinatorial information , they correspond to two distinct geometric pictures . throughout this paper",
    "we shall go back and forth between these two pictures .",
    "for example , property ( 1 ) , that @xmath6 acts simply transitively on the vertex set of the cubical cellulation , means that @xmath6 acts simply transitively on the set of @xmath9-dimensional dual cells .",
    "so , @xmath8 is `` tiled '' by isomorphic copies of such an @xmath9-dimensional dual cell",
    ".    let @xmath10 denote the group of all lifts of the @xmath6-action to @xmath8 . fix a vertex @xmath11 of the cubical structure on @xmath8 . by property ( 1 ) each edge containing @xmath11",
    "is flipped by a unique involution in @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath8 is connected , these involutions generate @xmath10 and the @xmath12-skeleton of @xmath8 is the cayley graph of @xmath10 with respect to this set of generators .",
    "since @xmath8 is simply connected , a presentation for @xmath10 can be derived by examining the @xmath7-cells that contain @xmath11 and the @xmath7-skeleton of @xmath8 is the cayley @xmath7-complex of this presentation .",
    "( this is explained in section  [ ss : group - a ] and [ s : tilings ] . )",
    "furthermore , the fundamental group of @xmath4 is naturally identified with the kernel of the epimorphism @xmath13 induced by the projection @xmath14 .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to initiate the study of such symmetry groups @xmath10 .",
    "this paper has two major thrusts :    * to describe a large class of examples of the above type ( in sections [ s : intro ] - [ s : dual ] , [ s : permuto ] and [ s : associahedral - tilings ] ) , and * to develop a general theory of tilings and their symmetry groups ( in sections  [ s : tilings ] and [ s : linearity ] ) .",
    "we first give a rough description of the examples .",
    "the first examples are fairly standard and arise from actions of right - angled reflection groups on manifolds .",
    "( in this setting @xmath8 is the manifold , and @xmath10 is the reflection group . )",
    "the other examples that we discuss arise by performing an equivariant blow - up procedure to ( not necessarily right - angled ) reflection group actions and lifting to the universal cover . in this case",
    ", @xmath8 is the universal cover , and @xmath10 is the group of lifts of the reflection group action .",
    "an important guiding principle underlying this paper is that the group actions in the blow - up setting are tantalizingly similar to , but different from , reflection group actions .",
    "our reflection - type examples can be constructed as in @xcite or @xcite . given a simple polytope @xmath15 that is a candidate for the fundamental tile , let @xmath0 be the right - angled coxeter group with one generator for each codimension - one face and one relation for each codimension - two face .",
    "let @xmath8 be the result of applying the reflection group construction to @xmath15 and @xmath0 , and let @xmath16 be a torsion - free , normal subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "then we get examples of the above type with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "again , we note that these reflection type examples are _ not _ the ones of primary interest in this paper .",
    "our primary examples are manifolds that are constructed by blowing up certain subspaces of projective hyperplane arrangements in @xmath20 .",
    "the theory of such blow - ups was developed in @xcite .",
    "given a hyperplane arrangement in @xmath21 , there is an associated @xmath22-dimensional convex polytope @xmath23 called a `` zonotope '' .",
    "an equivalent formulation of the blowing - up procedure is described in @xcite : one `` blows - up '' certain cells of @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 denotes the antipodal map ) . in this generality ,",
    "the resulting cubical cell complex might not admit a suitable symmetry group @xmath6 satisfying property ( 1 ) .",
    "the condition needed is that the original zonotope @xmath23 admit a group of symmetries that is simply transitive on the vertex set of @xmath23 .",
    "the most obvious zonotopes with this property are the so - called `` coxeter cells '' .",
    "so , this paper is a continuation and specialization of @xcite to the case of hyperplane arrangements associated to finite reflection groups .",
    "a _ coxeter cell _ is a zonotope corresponding to a hyperplane arrangement associated to a finite reflection group @xmath0 on @xmath21 .",
    "a _ coxeter cell complex _ is a regular cell complex in which each cell is isomorphic to a coxeter cell .",
    "for example , since an @xmath22-cube is the coxeter cell associated to @xmath26 , any cubical complex is a coxeter cell complex . )    in @xcite we also discussed a generalization of the blow - up procedure to zonotopal cell complexes .",
    "again , in order for property ( 1 ) to hold we need to require that the zonotopal cell complex admit a group of automorphisms that acts simply transitively on its vertex set . examples of zonotopal cell complexes with this property are provided by coxeter groups .",
    "associated to any coxeter system @xmath27 , there is a coxeter cell complex @xmath28 such that @xmath0 acts simply transitively on its vertex set .",
    "( here @xmath0 might be infinite . )",
    "thus , we also want to apply our blowing up procedures to the complexes @xmath28 .    as data for such a blowing up procedure",
    "it is necessary to specify the set of cells which are to be blown up .",
    "there are two extreme cases , the `` minimal blow - up '' and the `` maximal blow - up '' . in the case of a minimal blow - up , this set of cells is the collection of all cells that can not be decomposed as a nontrivial product . in the case of a maximal blow - up , it is the set of all cells .",
    "next we describe the motivating example for this paper ( which was also one of the motivating examples for @xcite ) .",
    "consider the action of the symmetric group @xmath29 as a reflection group on @xmath21 .",
    "the associated hyperplane arrangement is called the `` braid arrangement '' .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the minimal blow - up ( as in @xcite or @xcite ) of the corresponding arrangement in @xmath20 .",
    "the interesting feature of @xmath4 lies in the result of kapranov @xcite that @xmath4 can be identified with @xmath30 , the real points of the grothendieck - knudsen moduli space of stable @xmath31-pointed curves of genus @xmath32 ( which , in turn , coincides with the chow quotient @xmath33 ) .",
    "kapranov also showed that each tile of the dual cellulation of @xmath4 was a copy of stasheff s polytope , the @xmath9-dimensional associahedron , @xmath34 .",
    "as explained in @xcite or in section  [ s : associahedral - tilings ] , below , the set of codimension - one faces of @xmath34 can be identified with the set of proper subintervals of @xmath35 $ ] with integer endpoints . moreover , given two such subintervals @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the corresponding faces intersect if and only if either ( i ) the distance between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( as subsets of @xmath35 $ ] ) is at least @xmath7 or ( ii ) @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) .    in the case at hand , where @xmath40 , the symmetry group @xmath6 is @xmath29 .",
    "the group @xmath10 has one involutory generator @xmath41 for each proper subinterval @xmath36 of @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the codimension - two faces of @xmath34 impose additional relations of two types : ( i ) if the distance between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is at least @xmath7 then @xmath42 and ( ii ) if @xmath38 , then @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 denotes the image of @xmath37 under the order - reversing involution of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the epimorphism @xmath45 sends @xmath41 to the order - reversing involution in the subgroup of @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath36 .",
    "looking at relation ( ii ) , it is clear that if the interval @xmath36 is not a single point , then @xmath41 will not act as a reflection on @xmath8 .",
    "we call it a `` mock reflection '' and @xmath10 a `` mock reflection group '' .",
    "similarly , given any finite coxeter group @xmath0 , one can take the minimal blow - up of the associated projective hyperplane arrangement to obtain a manifold @xmath4 with a cubical cell structure .",
    "when the coxeter diagram of @xmath0 is an interval , the tiles will again be associahedra .",
    "other examples arise by taking the maximal blow - up of an arrangement associated to a finite reflection group @xmath0 . in any such example",
    "each tile is a permutohedron .",
    "( in the case where @xmath46 these examples occur in nature as real toric varieties associated to flag manifolds . )    in sections  [ s : permuto ] and [ s : associahedral - tilings ] we prove some classification results for the universal covers of the permutohedral and associahedral tilings which arise from blow - ups . in section  [ s :",
    "permuto ] , we show that the universal covers of all such permutohedral tilings yield the same tiling of @xmath3 ; moreover , the various symmetry groups @xmath10 that arise in this fashion are commensurable with each other ( and with the right - angled reflection group associated to the permutohedron )",
    ". by way of contrast , in section  [ s : associahedral - tilings ] , we show that the various associahedral tilings of @xmath3 tend not to be isomorphic with each other .",
    "the reason for this dichotomy lies in the fact that the associahedron is much less symmetric than is the permutohedron .",
    "it turns out , however , that in dimensions @xmath47 all of the symmetry groups arising from these permutohedral and associahedral tilings are quasi - isometric to each other ( theorem  [ thm:2d - assoc - class ] and theorem  [ thm : q - iso ] ) .",
    "section  [ s : tilings ] , the longest section of the paper , concerns the general theory of tilings .",
    "the results in this section are of a somewhat different nature than in the rest of the paper .",
    "we develop the theory in a context which is considerably more general than is indicated by the above examples .",
    "all of our previous requirements are either weakened or dropped as explained below in statements ( a ) through ( e ) .    1 .",
    "the space is not required to be a manifold .",
    "the cell structure on the space need not be cubical ; however , each cell is required to be a coxeter cell .",
    "( this is to accomodate the `` partial blow - ups '' of @xcite and also to include arbitrary reflection type tilings in our general theory ) .",
    "3 .   in view of ( a )",
    ", there may no longer be a well - defined dual cell structure ; however , there are still `` dual cones '' and `` tiles '' ( that is , cones dual to vertices ) .",
    "the requirement that there exist a group @xmath6 that acts simply transitively on the vertex set is replaced by the requirement that the cell complex @xmath48 admit a `` framing '' ( which amounts to specifying isomorphisms between the links of any two vertices of @xmath48 ) .",
    "the requirement of nonpositive curvature is dropped .",
    "thus , in section  [ s : tilings ] we shall largely abandon the notion of a fundamental tile ( since , in view of ( c ) , it need not be a cell ) . by a `` tiling '' we will simply mean a coxeter cell complex @xmath48 in which the links of any two vertices are isomorphic .",
    "the tiling is `` symmetric '' if @xmath48 admits a group action which is simply transitive on its vertex set .",
    "if @xmath48 is symmetric and simply connected , then one can read off a presentation for its symmetry group @xmath10 ( cf . section  [ ss : homogeneous - framings ] ) as before .    a key ingredient in our analysis of framed tilings and their symmetry groups is the notion of a `` gluing isomorphism . ''",
    "this is is an isomorphism between two `` codimension - one faces '' of a fundamental tile .",
    "it determines how two adjacent tiles are glued together . in practice",
    "( e.g. when the symmetry group is generated by involutions ) , these gluing isomorphisms will always be involutions .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume this .",
    "for example , in a reflection type tiling , each gluing involution is the identity map . for blow - ups of @xmath28 ,",
    "the gluing involutions are determined by the elements of longest length in various finite special subgroups of @xmath0 . in [ ss : glu - iso ] and [ ss : iso - reflection ] , we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the sets of gluing involutions for the universal covers of two tilings to be isomorphic .",
    "( this result is then used in sections  [ s : permuto ] and [ s : associahedral - tilings ] to classify certain permutohedral and associahedral tilings . ) in theorem  [ thm : gluings - to - group ] , we describe necessary and sufficient conditions under which a given fundamental tile and set of gluing involutions can be realized by a symmetric tiling .    in sections  [ s :",
    "tilings ] and [ s : linearity ] we also prove , under very mild hypotheses , some general results about the symmetry group @xmath10 of a symmetric and simply connected @xmath48 . since these hypotheses are satisfied in our examples , these results apply to the universal cover of a blow - up .",
    "first of all , even without the nonpositive curvature requirement , @xmath48 can always be `` completed '' to a cat(@xmath32)-complex @xmath49 by adding a finite number of @xmath10-orbits of cells .",
    "( this is proved in sections  [ ss : hat - x ] and [ ss : cat-0 ] . )",
    "thus , each such @xmath10 is a `` cat(@xmath32 ) group '' ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cat(0)-groups - from - framings ] ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath50 is any torsion - free subgroup of finite index in @xmath10 , then @xmath51 is a finite @xmath52-complex .",
    "secondly , @xmath10 has a linear representation analogous to the canonical represention for a coxeter group ( section  [ s : linearity ] ) .",
    "whether this representation is always faithful , however , remains an interesting open question .",
