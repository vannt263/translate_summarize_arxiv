    "moreover , in proposition [ pcubicfourfolds ] we collect some results that point out the importance of the questions of existence of ( finite - dimensional , connected , non - trivial ) algebraic subgroups in @xmath13 and of the classification of birational automorphisms with all dynamical degrees equal to @xmath11 for the irrationality problem for cubic fourfolds @xmath0 . in section [ supperdeg ]",

    "let us investigate the signature of the inner product / non - degenerate bilinear form on @xmath483 more concretely : first , for the @xmath494-part of the middle cohomology of a fourfold , we have the ( orthogonal with respect to the intersection form ) lefschetz decomposition @xmath495 here @xmath496 is the lefschetz operator , and the subscript prim denotes primitive cohomology .",

    "we also always have the equality @xmath508 . now suppose    1 .",
    "@xmath55 is a point : then @xmath509 , and by ( 4.1 ) , the inner product , if we imagine it to be diagonalized over @xmath510 to be given by a matrix with @xmath511 s and @xmath512 s on the diagonal , changes by adding one copy of @xmath512 .",

    "the extra cycles in @xmath522 can be described as the pull - backs via @xmath178 of ( 1 ) the point @xmath55 if @xmath55 is a point , ( 2 ) the curve @xmath55 and a point on it if @xmath55 is a curve , ( 3 ) curves on @xmath55 if @xmath55 is a surface , each time intersected with an appropriate power @xmath523 of the relative hyperplane class @xmath524 of the projective bundle @xmath525 to get an algebraic two - cycle .",
    "thus , if @xmath55 is a surface for example , we pull back curves on it to @xmath525 , which is a @xmath367-bundle , to get surfaces on @xmath155 .",

    "the situation is thus more complicated than the one with picard - manin spaces for surfaces , since there one can only blow up points , always adding @xmath512 s to the intersection form , which makes the resulting limit into a hyperbolic space in the sense of gromov .",
    "as we saw above , here we can be forced to add @xmath511 s and @xmath512 s , depending on whether we blow up points , curves or surfaces .",
    "hopefully the fact that on @xmath483 we achieve some sort of algebraic stability for the map @xmath6 ( taking iterates commutes with passing to associated maps on @xmath483 ) , and the fact that we can describe the inner product geometrically in the above sense , can help to prove estimates for dynamical degrees in terms of the cremona degrees in several cases .",
