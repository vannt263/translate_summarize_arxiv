    "the role of geometry has recently been considered as a factor of primary importance for the comprehension of several physical properties of proteins and other biological macromolecules . in particular , since the topology of folded states is known to influence the folding properties @xcite , a great deal of work has been devoted to the study of topological aspects describing the networks of links between aminoacids in folded proteins .",
    "futhermore , relevant features of protein conformations seem to follow the geometrical principles of the optimal packing problem  @xcite .",
    "starting from the primary , linear , structure ( the sequence of aminoacids ) , a protein evolves during the folding process until it reaches a final state ( native state ) whose geometrical shape is crucial to the function of the protein itself .",
    "however , the problem of the topological arrangement of proteins in their native states can not be regarded as purely static issue .",
    "indeed , a massive accumulation of experimental data collected from x - ray , nmr and neutron spectroscopy , has reveiled that protein native states are rather dynamic structures where aminoacids constantly move around equilibrium positions .",
    "this dynamics , crucially involved in protein functions @xcite , is usually examined and investigated through normal modes analysis ( nma ) @xcite and its variants @xcite .",
    "the study of collective motions of large proteins is generally of difficult accessibility to realistic all - atoms nma  @xcite and simplified or approximate approaches are usually welcome .",
    "tirion @xcite first proposed the possibility to replace , in protein normal mode computations , complicated empirical potentials by hookian pairwise interactions depending on a single parameter .",
    "the approach stems from the observation that low - frequency dynamics , which is mainly associated with protein - domain motion , is generally insensitive to the finer details of atomic interactions . a vast further literature @xcite confirmed the success of simple harmonic models in the study of slow vibrational dynamics of large biological macromolecules , until they become a viable alternative to heavy and time - consuming all - atoms nma .",
    "this success relies on the striking agreement with experiments , on the presence of few adjustable parameters and finally on their easy numerical implementation on computers and fast result production . for such reasons harmonic models are suitable also for the systematic analysis of large datasets of proteins .",
    "the topological stability of macromolecules is far from being a pure mechanical problem as it closely involves thermodynamics : indeed , the relevant thermodynamic potential to minimize in order to find the stable configuration is not an energy , but a free energy .",
    "this is due to the interaction with the environment ( schematized as a thermal bath ) which is generally not negligible , specifically for biological macromolecules having a stable phase in a solvent . in particular , water is a very efficient medium for the transfer of thermal energy at microscopic scales ( i.e. oscillations and molecular rotations ) .    following these considerations , in this work",
    "we apply the approach of nma to investigate the influence of the global native state topology on the thermal stability of proteins .",
    "vibrational thermal instability is a well - known issue in solid state physics .",
    "since the first classical analysis of peierls @xcite , it has been recognized that the equilibrium with a thermal bath can dramatically influence the allowed topological arrangement of large geometrical structures .",
    "the most striking consequence of peierls instability has concerned up to now low - dimensional crystals : for one and two - dimensional lattices the mean square displacement of a single atom at finite temperature diverges in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. with increasing number of atoms .",
    "when the displacement exceeds the order of magnitude of the lattice spacing , the topological arrangement of the lattice is unstable and the crystal becomes a liquid . for real structures , formed by a finite number of units and far from the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the divergence sets a maximal stability size , which is negligible for one - dimensional lattices and typically mesoscopic for two - dimensional lattices .    however , thermal instability is present not only in crystals but also in the case of structurally inhomogeneous systems , such as , glasses , fractals , polymers and non crystalline structures .",
    "there , the problem is much more complex . generalizing the peierls approach to mesoscopic disordered structures",
    ", we are able to apply this kind of arguments to the thermal stability of macromolecules . in the following",
    "we describe how this can be done in the case of proteins ; we will predict the existence of a critical stability size depending on a global topological parameter ( the spectral dimension ) and compare our predictions with experimental data .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite generalizing the peierls result , we have shown that a thermodynamic instability appears also in inhomogeneous structures and it is determined by the spectral dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 @xcite is defined according to the asymptotic behaviour of the density of harmonic oscillations at low frequencies .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath2 the density of modes with frequency @xmath3 , then @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "the spectral dimension is the most natural extension of the usual euclidean dimension @xmath6 to disordered structures as far as dynamical processes are concerned .",
    "it coincides with @xmath6 in the case of lattices , but in general , it can assume non - integer values between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral dimension represents a useful measure of the effective connectedness of geometrical structures at large scales , because large values of @xmath1 correspond to high topological connectedness .",
    "moreover , it characterizes not only harmonic oscillations , but it is also related to diffusion , phase transitions and electrical conductivity , allowing a variety of both experimental and numerical methods for its determination @xcite .",
    "the relevance of @xmath1 in connection with the anomalous density of vibrational modes in proteins has also been considered in refs.@xcite .    in the case of thermal instability",
    ", we demostrated that , for @xmath9 , the mean square displacement @xmath10 of a structural unit ( being an atom , a molecule or a supramolecular structure according to the studied case ) of a system composed of @xmath11 elements , diverges in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "denoting with @xmath13 the temperature of the heat bath and with @xmath14 the boltzmann constant , the divergence is given by the asymptotic law : @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath17 , the mean square displacement diverges logarithmically , @xmath18 , as in the case of the peierls result for a two dimensional crystal .",
    "notice that the divergence in @xmath10 is only determined by @xmath0 .",
    "now , at any given temperature @xmath13 , there will exist a threshold value @xmath19 beyond which @xmath20 exceeds the typical spacing between nearest neighbors , making the solid structure unstable .",
    "therefore at large enough @xmath11 , the solid will experience a structural reorganization which can lead either to a homogeneous liquid phase at sufficiently high temperatures or to a disordered 3-dimensional solid , which is homogeneous at large scales and inhomogeneous at small scales .",
    "in general , the threshold values of @xmath11 are very small with respect to the typical order of magnitude of macroscopic systems , being rather comparable to the size of large complex macromolecules such as biopolymers .",
    "this poses an intriguing question concerning proteins . indeed , to exploit their biological function proteins",
    "must keep a specified geometrical and topological arrangement and can not afford any , even partial , geometrical large scale fluctuations as it happens , instead , to swallen polymeric chains in a good solvent @xcite .",
    "this makes thermodynamical stability problems of crucial importance and suggests a possible correlation between the spectral dimension and the length of protein chains .",
    "the vibrational stability problem in proteins has been analysed through the gaussian network model ( gnm ) , proposed in @xcite , which yields results in agreement with principal x - ray spectroscopy experiments .",
    "this approach generally considers proteins as elastic networks , whose nodes are the positions of the alpha - carbons ( c@xmath21 ) in the native structure and the interactions between nodes are assimilated to harmonic springs .",
    "the only information required to implement the method is the knowledge of the native structure , and only two free parameters are introduced , the spring constant and interaction cutoff .",
    "the gnm is defined by the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath22 where the first term is the kinetic energy of the system , @xmath23 being the strength of the springs that are assumed homogeneous , @xmath24 and @xmath25 indicating the equilibrium position and the displacement with respect to @xmath24 of the @xmath26-th c@xmath21 atoms .",
    "the model is eventually defined by the contact matrix @xmath27 with entries : @xmath28 if the distance @xmath29 between two c@xmath21 s , in the native conformation , is below the cutoff @xmath30  , while is @xmath31 otherwise .",
    "the harmonic spectrum for each structure is given by the set of eigenvalues @xmath32 of the kirchhoff matrix ( or valency - adjaciency matrix ) @xmath33 ,    notice that the first eigenvalue @xmath34 vanishes and corresponds to the constant eigenvector , describing the trivial uniform translation .",
    "the comparison between experimental data and gnm results is obtained via the x - ray crystallographyc b - factors , measuring the mean square fluctuation of c@xmath35 atoms around native positions    @xmath36    in the gnm approximation , these can be expressed in terms of the diagonal part of the inverse of @xmath37  @xcite :    @xmath38_{ij}\\ ] ]    the comparison with crystallographyc data is crucial for setting the correct values of the free parameters @xmath39 end @xmath23 of the gnm ( see . methods and results ) .",
    "we present now the harmonic analysis of the gnm performed over the dataset of protein native structures with different sizes listed in table 1 . and downloaded from the brookheaven protein data bank .",
    "we selected our representative statistical sample according to the following criteria : first , we only considered proteins with a stable large scale geometry .",
    "this excludes multiple domains proteins , where the domains can move independently giving rise to large geometrical fluctuations .",
    "moreover , we selected proteins not binded to fragments of dna , rna or other substrates because such structures can not be described with sufficient accuracy in terms of simple harmonic model with only two effective parameters .    finally , we choose proteins covering uniformly a wide length interval ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 to test our prediction .",
    "the diagonalization of the kirchhoff matrix @xmath37 to obtain its eigenvalues @xmath42 and eigenvectors has been performed with the standard numerical packages @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the eigenvectors ( eigenmodes ) allows to compute the gnm b - factors : @xmath43 where @xmath26 is the residue index , the sum runs over all non - zero frequencies and @xmath44 indicates the @xmath26-th component of the @xmath45-th eigenmode .    when generating the contact matrix @xmath46 , the value of the interaction cutoff @xmath39 has been chosen in order to have agreement between the experimental and the gnm b - factors for each proteins , as showed in fig .",
    "[ bfact ] .",
    "we found that the average value @xmath47 was a consistent choice for the whole set of proteins .",
    "the purpose of our analysis is basically :    \\a ) investigating whether there exists a correlation between the spectral dimension of native structures and the length of natural occurring proteins ;    \\b ) in the case of positive result for point a ) , verifying whether the correlation is connected with equation ( [ pl ] ) .",
    "this expression establishes a rather strong relation between the spectral dimension and the maximum size @xmath48 of a protein .",
    "since the stability is supposed to fail when the fluctuation @xmath20 becomes of the same order of magnitude of the mean distance between non consecutive aminoacids ( @xmath49   ) , one has    @xmath50    the proportionality constant @xmath51 in ( [ div ] ) depends on the mean aminoacid spacing , on the spring elastic constant g and temperature t. however , this dependece is very weak ( i.e.only logarithmic ) .",
    "this allows for a comparison of different proteins without the computation of the specific parameters .",
    "actually , equation ( [ div ] ) , being based uniquely on thermodynamics stability , can be regarded as an upper bound prediction only .    in figure  2 , we plot the harmonic spectrum , obtained within the gnm , for three proteins with sizes , small , medium and large , respectively .",
    "the low frequency regions clearly exhibit a power law behavior whose exponent @xmath52 is directly related to the spectral dimension via formula @xmath53 .",
    "figure  3 summarises the results of our analysis .",
    "we plot the @xmath54 versus the computed slope from the spectra .",
    "the choice of these variables is suggested by relation ( [ div ] ) : indeed , if eqn.(3 ) holds , we should obtain a straight line crossing the origin .",
    "as matter of fact , our data are very well fitted by a straight line , with linear regression coefficient @xmath55 , but described by the equation @xmath56 with parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the neat result expressed by ( [ parb ] ) deserves several comments .",
    "first , this equation is in agreement with the upper bound we obtained eq .",
    "[ div ] , supporting the relevance of topological thermal instability in constraining the protein geometry .",
    "more important , not only the upper bound is satisfied , but the experimental points lie on a straight line parallel to the upper bound one eq .",
    "( [ div ] ) .",
    "this suggests a more fundamental role of topological stability : in some sense , the protein tends to arrange topologically in such a way to reach the minimum value compatible with stability constraints . in other words , for any fixed length , it tends to the most swollen state which remains stable with respect to thermal fluctuations .",
    "a very interesting point is the meaning of the parameter @xmath59 which is 0 in eq .",
    "( [ div ] ) .",
    "its positive value could have different motivations , but its universal nature ( it is a `` protein - independent '' global shift ) must be due to a very general mechanism .",
    "a rather obvious reason is the contribution of anharmonic interactions at finite temperatures ; a more intriguing one could be an effective longer range interaction due to the presence of bound water molecules around the external aminoacids , which could change the effective form of the interaction matrix @xmath60 .",
    "this hypothesis is also suggested by the physical interpretation of @xmath59 as an anomalous dimension exponent , typically related to a renormalized interaction @xcite    however , the most intriguing evidence relies on the regression coefficient independently of the physical origin of @xmath59 , its high value strongly supports the existence of a thermodynamic stability threshold , dependent on the topology of the folded state , for the size of proteins .",
