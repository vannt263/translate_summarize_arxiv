    "it is widely accepted that star - forming disc galaxies such as the milky way have sustained their star formation over gigayears by accreting gas at a fairly steady or slowly declining rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "is discarded also on observational grounds , because such gas can not be less metal rich than the local interstellar medium , whereas the high - velocity cloud complex c , which lies @xmath2 from the plane , has @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this finding suggests that some s , especially those more than @xmath4 from the plane , represent matter that is entering the galaxy for the first time @xcite .",
    "at least some s must have been stripped from infalling satellites because some clouds are clearly associated with the magellanic stream , which is itself thought to have been torn from the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "counts of stars in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and in deep surveys of m31 @xcite have shown that the outer stellar halos of the galaxy and m31 are far from relaxed and are best thought of as a superpositions of dissolving satellites .",

    "these clouds were presumed to be too small to be detected , but removed sufficient x - ray emitting gas from the cooling flow to reconcile the theoretical and observational surface - brightness profiles .",
    "eventually this theory of `` distributed mass drop out '' was ruled out by the absence of spectral lines in soft x - rays that should have accompanied the formation of the clouds @xcite . however ,",

    "* bs ) , mainly in the context of the study of cooling flows in galaxy clusters . in many respects",
    "a galactic corona is just a scaled - down version of the hot atmosphere of a galaxy cluster .",
    "thus , under the assumption that the corona is non - rotating and spherically symmetric , the formalism of previous work of spherical models of cooling flows can be applied straightforwardly . however , the detailed thermal behaviour of the system is sensitive to the gas temperature and density distribution , so the conclusions drawn in the case of clusters can not be a priori extended to lower - mass systems .    here",
    "we follow the treatment of mrb who used eulerian plane - wave perturbations to study thermal instability in a spherically symmetric stratified atmosphere in the presence of a flow , including the effects of cooling and thermal conduction .",

    "near the edge of an adiabatic corona the temperature gradient is steep and the density low ( below ) , so the conductivity may saturate . reduced conductivity will underline the tendency of these regions to be thermally unstable .",
    "apart from the presence of the factor @xmath18 , we treat the hot galactic gas as unmagnetized .",
    "we do not attempt to model the magnetic field in the corona for simplicity and because its properties are poorly constrained .",
    "an ordered magnetic field can have subtle effects on thermal instability @xcite , but , as we explain in section 5 , far from the disc the field is unlikely to be ordered .",
    "the unperturbed corona is assumed to be close to hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium in the sense that the system is approximately in a steady state over the time scales of interest even in the presence of radiative cooling and thermal conduction .",

    "specific entropy is unchanged as the fluid moves , so the colours and contours are frozen into the fluid .",
    "at the points marked a and c in the figure , the entropy perturbation is positive because the fluid is displaced downward from equilibrium , while at point b the fluid is displaced upwards .",

    "consequently , the effective inertia that has to be overcome by the perturbation s buoyancy increases with the flattening of the perturbation , so @xmath46 decreases with @xmath42 .    in the absence of conduction or a confining gravitational force ( @xmath47 ) equation ( [ eqdisp ] )",

    "in the course of buoyant oscillations , a parcel of gas is half the time overdense and cooler with respect to its surroundings , and half the time underdense and warmer , so unless @xmath56 , neither conduction nor radiation will have a big impact on buoyant oscillations .",
    "this expectation is borne out by exact analysis of the dispersion relation ( [ eqdisp ] ) , which shows that when @xmath57 modes are monotonically growing if @xmath42 is smaller than @xmath58 in addition , thermal conduction stabilises perturbations with wavelengths smaller than @xmath59^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    although sufficiently flattened perturbations can be thermally unstable , equation ( [ eqlambdacrit ] ) places a lower bound on the thickness of any thermally unstable disc , so such a disc s transverse size must be considerable .",
    "it is likely that the hot atmospheres of galaxies , galaxy groups and clusters are turbulent by virtue of cosmic infall , galactic winds and jets from agn .",
    "consequently , an extended disc - like overdensity is unlikely to remain flat and exactly tangentially oriented for more than a dynamical time .",

    "the thermal and dynamical evolution of a galactic corona is ultimately determined by four timescales : the dynamical time of the system @xmath63 , the gas isobaric cooling time @xmath64 the bv time @xmath65 and the thermal instability time @xmath66 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hm ] illustrates this by plotting these timescales for a particular atmosphere representative of those of massive elliptical galaxies ( model hm of * ? ? ?",

    "clearly , a necessary condition for a corona to be in equilibrium is @xmath68 , so in the dotted line lies above the short - dashed line : a plasma in which this condition is violated is experiencing a cooling catastrophe , and the question of its thermal stability is meaningless .",
    "let us focus on systems with @xmath68 , which are approximately in equilibrium and , at least in principle , can be prone to thermal instability . as we have seen , thermal perturbations of average shape ( @xmath69 ) can grow only if @xmath70 , because otherwise buoyancy is effective in restoring the unperturbed entropy profile . in the typical case of subadiabatic temperature profile ,",
    "the bv time is of the order of the dynamical time ( both being determined mainly by the gravitational field ) , while the thermal instability time is of the order of the cooling time ( both being determined mainly by the cooling function ) .",
    "hence in the long - dashed line lies close to the short - dashed line , while the solid line lies close to the dotted line , which necessarily lies above the short - dashed line .",
    "as a consequence , it is not easy to find systems in which both the conditions @xmath68 and @xmath70 are satisfied , and this is the main reason why stratified atmospheres are typically thermally stable as mrb pointed out in the context of rich galaxy clusters .    ) . ]    however , from equations ( [ eqomegath ] ) and ( [ eqtcool ] ) , @xmath71 and shows that @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",

    "figure  [ fig : omegath ] shows that the scope for simultaneously satisfying both conditions is largest at temperatures @xmath78 where the cooling function increases steeply for decreasing temperature .",
    "thus , the development of thermal instability in galactic coronae , which have virial temperatures in this range , can not be excluded a priori .",
    "as the temperature profile approaches the adiabatic temperature profile , @xmath74 becomes arbitrarily long ( see equation  [ eqomegabv ] )  in an adiabatic atmosphere there is no tendency for buoyancy to restore displaced material to its original radius .",
    "hence an atmosphere with a very shallow entropy profile may well be thermally unstable .",
    "information on the entropy profile of galactic coronae is then crucial for the issue of their thermal stability ( see also bs ) .",
    "finally , thermal conductivity can potentially give an important contribution to the suppression of small - scale perturbations : conductivity damps all perturbations with wavelength smaller than the critical wavelength @xmath79 ( equation  [ eqlambdacrit ] ) .",
    "the extent of this damping depends on the poorly constrained suppression of conductivity , which we parametrise with the dimensionless factor @xmath18 .",
    "however , we will see that even strongly suppressed thermal conduction can have non - negligible stabilising effect .",
    "the discussion above leads to the conclusion that the window for the development of thermal instability in galactic coronae is narrow , but not necessarily closed .",
    "thus , to address the question of the thermal stability of the  it is necessary to apply the results of the perturbation analysis to specific models of galactic coronae .",
    "application of the thermal instability analysis to the x - ray emitting hot atmospheres of massive elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies has shown clearly that these systems can not develop thermal instabilities ( mrb , bs ) .",

    "[ fig : hm ] , which shows the relevant timescales for a massive elliptical galaxy model : in this case the bv timescale is at least two orders of magnitude shorter than the thermal instability timescale .    here we address directly the question of whether the  surrounding disc galaxies is prone to thermal instability .",
    "unfortunately , the properties of the coronae of disc galaxies are not as well known as those of their more massive counterparts , mainly because they have low x - ray surface brightnesses on account of their low gas densities . despite various attempts to detect in x - rays the coronae of disc galaxies ,",

    "in the special case of the milky way different pieces of information can be used to constrain the physical properties of the corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here we consider simple non - rotating spherical models of coronae representative of the  surrounding specific disc galaxies , whose gross properties are consistent with the observational constraints .",
    "the neglect of rotation is a serious limitation of this work because rotation must become dynamically important sufficiently close to the disc if the corona is to feed the disc .",

    "the corona is convectively unstable and clouds of cool gas will fall inwards . further in , the specific entropy profile remains extremely flat as entropy is radiated away , and regions of depressed temperature will not be stabilised by buoyancy .",

    "before there has been significant cooling at the periphery , and for @xmath174 a point of inflection develops in @xmath175 at @xmath176 around the time ( @xmath177 ) when cooling becomes catastrophically fast at the centre .",
    "the central panels of show that thermal instability occurs only at radii in excess of @xmath1 .",
    "this is the case because the steep portion in the cooling curve , which drives the instability , occurs at temperatures that are significantly below the central temperature of the corona ",
    "such temperatures are reached only close to the edge of the corona because when the circular speed is assumed constant ( as here ) they imply a steep density profile .",
    "in fact , the formation of a region of outwards - decreasing specific entropy depends sensitively on the shape of the cooling function .",

    "once entropy is either independent of radius or outwards - decreasing , there is nothing to inhibit bulk radial motion of gas . in an adiabatic atmosphere",

    ", such motions will arise spontaneously .",
    "radial bulk motions transfer heat between different radial shells of a corona , and , as in the theory of stellar structure , it is natural to assume that convective energy transport will maintain an adiabatic entropy profile in any region in which entropy would otherwise be outwards - decreasing .",
    "hence we modified the code that produced to include convection as follows .",
    "after each timestep , the code looks for regions in which entropy is outwards decreasing and sets the specific entropy @xmath179 of each mass shell in this region to a common value @xmath180 .",

    "one sees that after a gyr specific entropy is constant through nearly half the mass . thus metal - enhanced cooling combined with convection",
    "has considerable potential for driving the outer half of a polytropic corona to an adiabatic configuration , provided that the initial entropy profile is shallow enough .",
    "however , the fact that polytropic models are characterised by a finite boundary at which the temperature drops to zero is crucial for these systems to evolve towards a configuration with flat entropy profile in the outer regions .",
    "we do not expect that these conditions are met in real galaxies , which are surrounded by the intergalactic medium .",
    "in this paper we examined the proposal that s of the milky way and other disc galaxies form by condensation of the  through thermal instability .",
    "the linearised equations for the evolution of thermal perturbations within a cooling , conducting , non - rotating spherical corona show that unless specific entropy is a shallow function of radius ( a nearly adiabatic corona ) , regions in which the temperature is initially anomalously low do not experience the classical field instability .",
    "in fact they are simply points at which an internal gravity wave is momentarily in the ascendant , and after half a brunt - visl period the material in this region will sink to below its equilibrium radius and will then be an anomalously warm region .",
    "consequently , there is no thermal instability from which clouds can form in a corona in which there is a significant gradient in the specific entropy .",
    "clouds can form in a strictly adiabatic corona because in this case buoyancy vanishes and the increase in the specific cooling function @xmath178 with decreasing temperature around @xmath189 can cause the cooling rate to increase outwards notwithstanding the steady decline in gas density with radius .",
    "this increase in the cooling rate can cause the specific entropy to become outwards - decreasing and thus the corona to become convectively unstable . in these circumstances clouds of rapidly cooling material will tumble inwards if thermal conductivity is too weak to carry enough heat from the warm interior to the rapidly cooling periphery to offset radiative cooling .",
    "an examination of adiabatic coronae for three galaxies , ngc5746 , the milky way , and ngc6503 shows that thermal conductivity that is suppressed to @xmath190 of spitzer s fiducial value would eliminate thermal instability entirely in ngc5746 and largely in the milky way , where perturbations smaller than @xmath0 in extent could grow only at @xmath191 . the efficiency with which thermal conductivity can suppress thermal instability is greatest in the hottest coronae because the spitzer s",
    "conductivity is a strongly increasing function of temperature .",
    "so in a low - mass galaxy such as ngc6503 , perturbations @xmath0 in extent could grow through most of the corona , although a perturbation only a kpc in extent would be stabilised almost everywhere .",
    "it is implausible that all the gas in a corona initially has exactly the same specific entropy .",
    "the gas will inevitably be spread over a range of specific entropies , and within a few dynamical times convection will sort the corona by specific entropy so that entropy is outwards - increasing . a convenient way of simulating the consequences of such a spread in entropy is to consider coronae that are initially polytropes with index @xmath168 . in such coronae",
    "there is a significant radial gradient in specific entropy near the corona s edge , where the temperature is low and thermal instability is most likely .",
    "non - linear simulations of the cooling of initially polytropic coronae for the milky way show that when the polytropic index @xmath81 is smaller than @xmath192 , cooling steepens the initial outwards - increasing entropy gradient rather than reversing it and this ensures that anomalously cool regions are buoyantly stabilised against thermal instability .",
    "our conclusion that a flat entropy profile is a necessary condition for the growth of thermal instability in galactic coronae is consistent with the recent results of sph simulations by @xcite , who find that cold clouds form from hot gas only in systems with flat entropy profiles .",
    "however , we find that except in very low - mass systems , thermal conductivity ( which was not considered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is capable of suppressing thermal instability at most radii , even when the conductivity is strongly suppressed .    in light of these results ,",
    "is it likely that the clouds of  that are actually observed have formed by cooling of coronal gas ?",
    "a major issue is that observed  clouds , such as complex c and the filament of ngc891 lie at radii @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "clouds are not found as far out as the bounding radii of a nearly adiabatic atmospheres that would contain the missing baryons , while theory indicates that it is precisely near these radii that clouds may form as a result of the coronal temperature falling through @xmath193 , where the cooling function is sufficiently steep .",
    "one might speculate that initially clouds have densities and masses that lie below the thresholds for detection , and it is only after they have fallen in to much smaller radii , where the confining pressure is higher , and accreted coronal gas or merged with other clouds , that they become detectable . in this case",
    "deeper surveys should find clouds out to in excess of @xmath1 .",
    "however , a difficulty with this proposal is that small clouds are thermally unstable only if the corona s thermal conductivity is heavily suppressed  in fact to less than a percent of spitzer s value .",
    "thermal instability only occurs if the coronal temperature falls through @xmath193 . in the polytropic coronae discussed here",
    "this condition is satisfied because @xmath21 vanishes at a finite radius .",
    "however , this feature of a polytropic corona is artificial : in reality the corona will at some point merge into the general intergalactic medium , which is likely to have high entropy and a temperature which could well be above @xmath194 .    except in section [ sec : timeevol ] our analysis is linear in nature and does not apply close to the star - forming disc since this region is violently disturbed by expanding supershells .",
    "however , linear analysis should be a reasonable approximation several kiloparsecs from the disc where hvcs are observed .",
    "a significant limitation of our work is that it excludes both magnetic fields and rotation of the corona . @xcite and @xcite showed that magnetic fields can in principle have a big impact on the stability of cooling flows .",
    "however , the relevance of the linear calculations presented by these authors to real cooling flows and coronae is doubtful because in order to perform the analysis one has to assume an unperturbed magnetic - field configuration that is consistent with the unperturbed cooling flow  this field turns out to be radial .",
    "the modes obtained obviously reflect the particular stress tensor of this field , and are valid only for perturbations that do not significantly change the field geometry because @xmath195 . in cooling flows",
    "magnetic pressure is much smaller than thermal pressure and probably on the order of the turbulent pressure @xmath196 .",
    "consequently the results of @xcite are valid only when the velocities associated with modes are small compared to @xmath197 .",
    "but we are precisely interested in the turbulent motions themselves , so this condition will be seriously violated .",
    "moreover , given that the magnetic pressure is not larger than the turbulent pressure , the magnetic field will be tangled by the turbulence rather than have the special geometry required by the assumption that a steady state is maintained in the presence of a radial accretion flow .",
    "it seems likely that in these circumstances the safest procedure is simply to assume that the effect of the ( tangled ) magnetic field is confined to augmenting the isotropic pressure by @xmath198 . in this case",
    "our results are applicable .",
    "rotation , by contrast , may have a significant impact on thermal stability . indeed ,",
    "if clouds that condense from the corona are to feed the growth of a centrifugally supported gas disc , rotation must be dynamically important near the disc .",
    "however , clouds are observed far from the disc , where rotation will be less important , and the question is whether a level of rotation that is dynamically small ( in the sense that the centrifugal acceleration is much smaller than the gravitational acceleration ) can introduce thermal instability by obstructing internal gravity waves .",
    "we reserve this difficult question for a later paper .",
    "we conclude that , if galactic haloes are well represented by non - rotating , quasi - hydrostatic atmospheres , thermal instability is not a viable mechanism for the formation of cold clouds in disc galaxies as massive as , or more massive than , the milky way .",
    "it may just work in low - mass systems if their ( essentially unconstrained ) entropy profiles are almost perfectly flat .",
    "our best guess is that the observed population of s around the milky way and other large nearby galaxies represent gas that has been stripped from satellites .",
    "this conclusion leaves open the question of how gas moves from the  to the disc , as it must if star formation is to be sustained .",
    "@xcite present circumstantial evidence that the key to this transfer is the galactic fountain , which constantly cycles disc gas through the bottom of the corona .",
    "to understand this transfer we need models of the corona that include significant centrifugal support near the disc ."
