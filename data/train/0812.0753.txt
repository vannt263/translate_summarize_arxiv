    "the first theoretical constructions related with directed transport have been formulated in an early work by feynman @xcite .",
    "this opened a field whose relevance and activity has been increasing since then .",
    "the motivation is twofold , in the first place several fundamental questions have originated from these ideas and have been only partially answered @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the subject grew into a major new field of statistical physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the wealth of possible applications has determined the emergence of a very broad area of research in physics .",
    "ratchets , generically defined as periodic systems having a dissipative dynamics associated with thermal noise and unbiased perturbations ( driving them out of equilibrium ) , can be used to model a wide range of different phenomena . in order to give just a few examples we can mention molecular motors in biology @xcite , nanodevices ( rectifiers , pumps , particle separators , molecular switches and transistors ) @xcite , and coupled josephson junctions @xcite . on the other hand , there is a great interest in the theoretical description and experimental implementations of cold atoms subjected to time - dependent standing waves of light .",
    "they play a central role in many studies of the quantum dynamics of nonlinear systems ( dynamical localization , decoherence , quantum resonance , etc . )",
    "in particular , the so - called optical ratchets , i.e. directed transport of laser cooled atoms , have been successfully implemented in this sort of experiments @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a net current can be classically explained by the necessary condition of breaking all spatiotemporal symmetries leading to momentum inversion @xcite .",
    "this , along with curie s principle indicates that transport should be present , given that it is not forbidden . as an example of this situation we can mention hamiltonian systems ( with necessarily mixed phase spaces ) where a chaotic layer should be asymmetric @xcite . in the more general dissipative case , chaotic attractors having this property are necessary @xcite .",
    "it is usual that the same principle translates almost directly into the quantum domain @xcite , and very similar behaviors arise .",
    "but sometimes quantum mechanics introduces new effects @xcite and the results depart from the classical ones .",
    "for example , the efficiency of a forced thermal quantum ratchet has been calculated in @xcite . in that work",
    "the authors find that the quantum current is higher in comparison with the classical one at the lowest values of the temperature .",
    "as this parameter increases the discrepancies diminish and finally they become negligibly small .",
    "recently , a quantum chaotic dissipative ratchet has been introduced in @xcite . in this example",
    "directed transport appears for particles under the influence of a pulsed asymmetric potential in the presence of a dissipative environment at zero temperature .",
    "the asymmetry of the quantum strange attractor is at the origin of the quantum current , in close analogy with what happens at the classical level .",
    "indeed , this work provides with the parameters needed for a possible implementation using cold atoms in an optical lattice . for a somewhat similar dynamics , the case of weak",
    "coupling and low temperature has been studied in @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend the study of @xcite for a wide range of couplings with the environment and different temperature values .",
    "we have verified that there is a strong dependence of the current behavior on the coupling strength .",
    "if we compare this with the results found in @xcite , for instance , we could not find a generic enhancement of the quantum current for finite temperatures . instead of that",
    ", we could identify a close quantum - to - classical correspondence when considering thermal effects only at the classical level .",
    "in fact , we have found that the finite @xmath0 effects on the quantum current are analogous to the influence of the classical thermal fluctuations on the classical transport .    in the following",
    "we describe the organization of this paper . in section",
    "ii we present our model for the system and for the environment , explaining the methods we have used to investigate the current behavior . in section iii",
    "we show the results where the roles of @xmath0 , the coupling strength and the temperature are analyzed in detail .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize and point out our conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the approach used to model the system plus the environment .",
    "we study the motion of a particle in a periodic kicked asymmetric potential given by @xmath1 \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{+ \\infty } \\delta ( t - m \\tau)\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the kicking period , @xmath3 is the strength of the kick , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are parameters that allow to introduce a spatial asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the effects of the environment are taken into account by means of a velocity dependent damping and thermal fluctuations . at the classical level ,",
    "these ingredients are incorporated in the following map :    @xmath6 + \\xi \\\\ \\overline{x}= x + \\tau \\overline{n } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    in these expressions , @xmath7 is the momentum variable conjugated to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the dissipation parameter , with @xmath10 .",
    "the thermal noise @xmath11 is related to @xmath9 , according to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 is the temperature , making the formulation consistent with the fluctuation - dissipation relationship . by performing the change of variables",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , we can eliminate the period from the classical expressions , and define the new map @xmath20 + \\tilde \\xi \\\\ \\overline{x}= x + \\overline{p } \\end{array } \\right . \\label{cl_map}\\ ] ]    in the quantum version of the model the system hamiltonian is given by @xmath21 where the quantization has been performed in such a way @xcite that @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this amounts to saying that , being @xmath25=i\\tau$ ] , there is an effective planck constant given by @xmath26 .",
    "then , the classical limit corresponds to @xmath27 , while keeping @xmath28 constant .    in order to incorporate dissipation and thermalization to the quantum map we consider the coupling of the system to a bath of non interacting oscillators in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the bath are eliminated introducing the usual weak coupling , markov and rotating wave approximations @xcite .",
    "this leads to a lindblad equation in action representation @xmath29 \\ , + \\ , \\\\ \\!\\!\\ ! & + & \\ ! g \\ , \\sqrt{n^+_{th } ( \\omega_n , t ) n^+_{th}(\\omega_{n'},t ) } \\ , \\ { [ \\hat{l}_n , \\hat{\\rho } \\hat{l}_{n'}^{\\dagger } ] + [ \\hat{l}_n \\hat{\\rho},\\hat{l}_{n'}^{\\dagger}]\\ } \\\\ \\!\\!\\ ! & + & \\ ! g \\ , \\sqrt{n^-_{th } ( \\omega_n , t ) n^-_{th}(\\omega_{n'},t ) } \\ { [ \\hat{l}_n^{\\dagger } , \\hat{\\rho } \\hat{l}_{n ' } ] + [ \\hat{l}_n^{\\dagger } \\hat{\\rho},\\hat{l}_{n'}]\\ } \\end{array } \\label{qdiff}\\ ] ] where the frequencies @xmath30 are the energy differences between two neighboring levels of the rotator . the population densities of the bath found in eq .",
    "[ qdiff ] are given by @xmath31 the system operators @xmath32 describe transitions towards the ground state of the free rotator . requiring quantum to classical correspondence at short times",
    "we fix the coupling constant @xmath33 . for @xmath34",
    "we recover the master equation used in @xcite for the pure dissipative case .",
    "for finite temperature , the last term in eq .",
    "[ qdiff ] describes the thermal excitation of the rotator through absorption of heat bath energy .",
    "finally , eq . [ qdiff ] will be integrated numerically without further approximations .",
    "since we are interested in chaotic transport , throughout the following calculations we will use the set of parameters given by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in the hamiltonian limit , this case shows no visible stability islands in phase space .",
    "we have first studied some classical aspects of our system at zero temperature , beginning with the bifurcation diagrams in terms of @xmath38 as a function of the parameter @xmath39 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bifdiag](_a _ ) ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the chaotic attractors set in very fast for small @xmath9 . but this is not the case for larger values where the transient times can be very long .",
    "for this reason , we have calculated these diagrams with the last @xmath40 iterations of the map , after the first @xmath41 have been discarded .",
    "we have randomly taken @xmath42 initial conditions inside the unit cell ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 $ ] ) .",
    "several regular and chaotic windows alternate .",
    "the former are characterized by simple attractors ( stable fixed points of the dissipative map ) and the latter are dominated by chaotic attracting sets .",
    "the width in @xmath38 of these sets grows as dissipation weakens ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the main quantity characterizing transport is the current @xmath46 , where @xmath47 stands for the average taken on the initial conditions , and @xmath48 is the moment after the @xmath49th iteration of the map . since bifurcations that change the shape of strange attractors also play a role in determining the values of the asymptotic current we restrict our analysis to the chaotic window approximately located at @xmath50 $ ] indicated by an arrow .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : bifdiag](a ) displays the asymptotic current @xmath51 as a function of @xmath9 ( circles stand for @xmath34 ) . at this @xmath9 range ,",
    "100 kicks are enough to reach the stationary behavior , independently of the initial distributions .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , dissipation induces an asymmetry of the strange attractor which is responsible for the directed transport . on the other hand this dissipation mechanism contracts phase space and makes the higher energies inaccessible for the system .",
    "the final value of @xmath52 results from the interplay between both effects .",
    "in fact , increasing dissipation does not increase the transport and the largest values of @xmath52 are obtained for the lowest values of dissipation , i.e. @xmath53 ( for example @xmath54 for @xmath55 ) .",
    "the minimum current in this window is reached for an intermediate value of dissipation ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we then consider the case of finite temperature .",
    "the bifurcation diagram corresponding to @xmath57 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifdiag](b ) .",
    "it is clear that the effect of temperature consists of smoothing the finer structure of the chaotic attractors that is present for the smallest values of @xmath9 .",
    "even for this extremely low value of @xmath14 the detailed features have almost completely disappeared , with the exception of the black lines corresponding to the highest values of the density distributions .",
    "the other very interesting effect is that temperature erases the regular windows allowing for a continuously chaotic behavior .",
    "this could be of much relevance in obtaining large ratchet currents without the need for an extremely fine tuned , weak dissipation @xcite ( this will addressed in future studies @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in the inset , low temperatures ( diamonds correspond to @xmath57 ) lead to a noticeable enhancement of the asymptotic current @xmath58 ( around @xmath59 for @xmath56 ) .",
    "we now turn to compare the classical and quantum behaviors .",
    "firstly , we analyze the currents ( which in the quantum case is given by @xmath60 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : allasympcurrentsvst ] we display @xmath58 as a function of @xmath14 , for three different values of @xmath9 and @xmath61 . at the classical level",
    "low temperatures lead to an enhancement of the current for intermediate values of the dissipation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : allasympcurrentsvst ] upper and middle panels corresponding to @xmath9= 0.7 , 0.75 ) . in the case of weak dissipation ( @xmath62 in the lower panel of fig . [ fig : allasympcurrentsvst ] ) , which displays larger values of @xmath58 , the effect of thermal noise is negligible . for higher temperatures , the thermal effects reduce @xmath52 in all cases .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows : thermal noise reduces the energy loss caused by dissipation ( with no kicks , the system would attain a boltzmann distribution ) , so higher energies can be reached , in comparison with a pure dissipative process .",
    "but since this diffusion also tends to blur the asymmetry of the strange attractor , the two effects compete and transport has a maximum for low values of t , and then decreases .    at the quantum level we can clearly see that the previously described thermal enhancement is not generally present , at least for the @xmath61 values we have considered .",
    "it is important to note that these values are consistent with experimental implementations using for example , cold sodium atoms in a laser field having a wave length @xmath63 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we observe a very slight growth of the current for the @xmath64 case with @xmath62 ( see the blue triangles in the lower panel of fig . [",
    "fig : allasympcurrentsvst])indicating that the temperature dependence of the current is very sensitive to the particular dynamics of the system . for a different example ,",
    "an enhancement of the quantum transport has been observed @xcite , hence it is difficult to extract universal behaviors . for @xmath65",
    "the quantum current is lower than the classical one for all temperatures , as already pointed out in @xcite , but only for @xmath34 .",
    "the same happens in the case of weak damping @xmath62 ( nevertheless , for @xmath64 and @xmath66 both currents coincide ) .",
    "the case @xmath67 shows a different behavior . at @xmath34",
    "the quantum currents ( for any of the @xmath61 values we have considered ) are larger than the classical ones , that is , there is an enhancement due to the finite size of @xmath61 .",
    "also , the maximal quantum current corresponds to @xmath68 , and this is valid for all the temperatures shown ( for @xmath69 it is still greater than the classical one ) . for larger quantum coarse - graining ( see @xmath70 ) quantum currents decrease . in this sense",
    ", it seems that the effect of quantum fluctuations on the quantum directed currents is analogous to the effect of those of thermal origin on the classical ones .",
    "small fluctuations of thermal or quantum mechanical origin assist directed transport while large fluctuations ( corresponding to high temperatures or to large values of @xmath61 respectively ) blur the asymmetry of the attractor and thus kill the net current .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case @xmath67 the thermal diffusion associated with the temperature which gives the maximal value of the current ( @xmath71 for @xmath72 ) is of the order of the quantum coarse - graining @xmath61 corresponding to the strongest quantum current .",
    "for @xmath65 the classical current attains its maximum value at @xmath69 ( @xmath73 ) , which corresponds to a value of @xmath61 that we were not able to consider in our numerical calculations .",
    "the analogy between thermal noise and quantum coarse - graining can also be appreciated when looking at the asymptotic poincare sections and husimi distributions ( displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] for @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) .",
    "as expected , at zero temperature the quantum husimi function reproduces well the main patterns of the classical attractor but shows less fine structure ( see the upper panels ) .",
    "if a small temperature is introduced the fine details of the classical distribution are smoothed out and both distributions look more alike ( see the lower panels corresponding to @xmath76 ) . on the other hand the quantum distributions at zero and finite temperatures",
    "are practically indistinguishable , indicating that the quantum coarse - graining is at least of the order of the thermal one for these values of @xmath14 .",
    "we finally study @xmath77 as a function of @xmath49 ( i.e. , the number of iterations of the map ) .",
    "results for @xmath67 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : currentvstg075 ] , where different temperatures and @xmath61 values have been considered .",
    "besides the mentioned fact that the asymptotic value is reached very rapidly , we notice that the transient behavior shows a very close quantum - to - classical correspondence .",
    "the classical current peak observed at @xmath78 for low temperatures ( @xmath76 ) is also present in the quantum current when @xmath64 and @xmath34 .",
    "this peak disappears from the classical current at larger temperatures ( @xmath79 ) , and so does the quantum one at @xmath70 and @xmath34 .",
    "so the analogy seems to hold at all times .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the behavior of a chaotic dissipative system that shows directed transport under the influence of a thermal bath , both in its classical and quantum versions .",
    "we have varied the strength of the coupling with the environment and also the temperature .",
    "we have found that the transport enhancement effect due to a finite temperature is highly dependent on the system specific properties .",
    "in fact , it depends on the coupling strength of the system with the environment and also on the @xmath0 size .",
    "moreover , we could find an analogy between the effects caused by thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "these results open the possibility for many further studies that include finding ways of obtaining large ratchet currents in experimentally realistic situations in kicked becs and cold atoms experiments",
    ". these are one of the best candidates to test our results since even becs show an unavoidable fraction of noncondensed atoms when kicked .",
    "if kicks become strong , thermal excitations will be of much relevance rather than a negligible effect . with the sort of calculations presented in this paper the effects of this fraction on the transport properties of the system",
    "could be estimated .",
