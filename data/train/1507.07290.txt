    "the prosperity of mobile internet calls for new technologies to meet the exponential increase in demand for mobile data traffic . in recent years , a heightened attention has been focused on massive multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) systems , which achieves significant gains in both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency , and thus are envisioned as a promising key enabler for the next generation cellular network @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus far , most of the works on massive mimo assume perfect hardware implementation .",
    "however , this assumption is not well justified , since the hardware cost and circuit power consumption scale linearly with the number of bs antennas and thus soon become economically unbearable unless low - cost , energy - efficient hardware is deployed which however easily suffers from impairments . among various sources of hardware impairment , low - resolution analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) have attracted ubiquitous attention due to their favorable property of low cost , low power consumption and feasibility of implementation @xcite . for nyquist - sampled real gaussian channel , the authors of @xcite established some general results regarding low - resolution output quantization .",
    "the authors of @xcite designed a modified minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver for mimo systems with output quantization . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated a practical monobit digital receiver paradigm for impulse radio ultra - wideband ( uwb ) systems .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite examined the impact of one - bit quantization on achievable rates of massive mimo systems with both perfect and estimated channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite addressed the high signal - to - noise ( snr ) capacities of both single input multiple output ( simo ) and mimo channels with one - bit quantization .    despite of its great superiority in deployment cost and energy efficiency",
    ", one - bit quantization generally has to tolerate large rate loss , especially in the high snr regime @xcite , thus highlighting the indispensability of high - resolution adc for digital receiver .",
    "motivated by such consideration , in this paper we propose a mixed receiver architecture for massive mimo systems in which one - bit adcs partially , but not completely , replace conventionally assumed high - resolution adcs .",
    "this architecture has the potential of allowing us to remarkably reduce the hardware cost and power consumption while still maintain a large fraction of the performance gains promised by massive mimo .",
    "recognizing the challenge in working with the channel capacity directly , we take an alternative route and seek to characterize the achievable data rates specified to certain encoding / decoding scheme . to this end , we exploit the information - theoretic tool of generalized mutual information ( gmi ) @xcite to address the achievable data rates of our proposed system architecture . as a performance measure for mismatched decoding ,",
    "gmi has proved convenient and useful in several important scenarios such as fading channels with imperfect csi at the receiver @xcite and channels with transceiver distortion @xcite , @xcite .    exploiting a general analytical framework developed in @xcite",
    ", we obtain a series of analytical results .",
    "first , we consider a deterministic simo channel where the bs is equipped with @xmath0 antennas but only has access to @xmath1 pairs of high - resolution adcs and @xmath2 pairs of one - bit adcs , and derive a closed - form expression of the gmi for general adc assignment and linear combiner .",
    "this enables us to optimize the linear combiner design and further explore the asymptotic behaviors of the gmi in both low and high snr regimes that in turn help us suggest a plausible adc assignment scheme .",
    "the corresponding numerical results indicate that even with a small number of high - resolution adcs , our system architecture already achieves a substantial fraction of the channel capacity without output quantization , thus verifying the effectiveness of the mixed architecture .",
    "further issues such as ergodic fading channels with or without channel estimation error are included in an extended work @xcite .",
    "then , we apply our analysis to the multi - user access scenario .",
    "numerical results reveal that the mixed system architecture with a small number of high - resolution adcs achieves a large fraction of the channel capacity without output quantization , provided that the multi - user system is properly loaded . in summary ,",
    "the proposed mixed architecture strikes a reasonable and attractive balance between cost and spectral efficiency , for both single - user and multi - user scenarios .",
    "thus we envision it as a promising receiver paradigm for energy - efficient massive mimo systems .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect : system architecture ] outlines the system model .",
    "adopting gmi as the performance metric , section [ sect : gmi and combiner ] establishes the theoretical framework for deterministic simo channels , based on which the optimal linear combiner design and the asymptotic behaviors of the gmi in both low and high snr regimes are explored .",
    "section [ sect : multi - user ] extends the theoretical framework to the multi - user access scenario .",
    "numerical results are given in section [ sect : numerical ] to corroborate the analysis .",
    "finally , section [ sect : conclusion ] concludes the paper .    _",
    "notation : _ throughout this paper , we use @xmath3 to represent the 2-norm of vector @xmath4 , and let @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the conjugate , transpose and conjugate transpose of @xmath8 , respectively . complex gaussian distribution with mean @xmath9 and variance @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 , while @xmath12 stands for the distribution of a circularly symmetric complex gaussian random vector with mean @xmath13 and covariance matrix @xmath14 .",
    "we use @xmath15 to denote the natural logarithm of positive real number @xmath16 .",
    "we start by focusing on a single - user system where a single - antenna user communicates with an @xmath0-antenna bs . in this paper",
    ", we consider a narrow - band channel model , for which the frequency - flat fading channel @xmath17 is chosen according to @xmath18 and is fixed throughout the transmission of the codeword .",
    "moreover , the realization of the channel is assumed to be perfectly known by the bs and thus is deemed as deterministic in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the received signal at the bs can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the complex signal transmitted at the @xmath21-th symbol time , @xmath22 models the independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "we further let the i / q outputs at each antenna be quantized by two adcs of the same kind . thus the quantized output can be expressed as @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the binding indicator : @xmath30 means that the adcs corresponding to the @xmath31-th antenna are high - resolution , whereas @xmath32 indicates that they are with one - bit resolution .",
    "note that here we assume sufficiently high resolution , so that the residual quantization noise is negligible , for @xmath30 . for notation simplicity ,",
    "we further define a binding vector @xmath33^{t}$ ] , which should be optimized according to the channel state @xmath17 so that the limited number of high - resolution adcs will be well utilized to enhance the system performance .        for transmission of rate @xmath34 ,",
    "the user selects a message @xmath35 from @xmath36 uniformly randomly , and maps the selected message to a transmitted codeword , i.e. , a length-@xmath23 complex sequence , @xmath37 . in this paper",
    ", we restrict the codebook to be drawn from a gaussian ensemble ; that is , each codeword is a sequence of @xmath23 i.i.d .",
    "@xmath38 random variables , and all the codewords are mutually independent .",
    "such a choice of codebook satisfies the average power constraint @xmath39\\leq\\mathcal{e}_\\mathrm{s}$ ] .",
    "we thus define the snr as @xmath40 , and let @xmath41 thereafter for convenience .    for an @xmath0-antenna simo channel , we let @xmath42 denote its capacity when equipped with @xmath43 pairs of high - resolution adcs and @xmath44 pairs of one - bit adcs , where @xmath45 . as discussed in the introduction , the evaluation of @xmath46 is a formidable task .",
    "therefore in the following , we adopt the nearest - neighbor decoding rule at the decoder , and leverage the general framework developed in @xcite to investigate the gmi of our proposed system architecture .",
    "the gmi acts as an achievable rate and thus also a lower bound of @xmath46 . to this end",
    ", we introduce a linear combiner to process the channel output vector , as illustrated in figure [ fig : systemmodel ] .",

    "thus our approach provides a systematic way of designing energy - efficient massive mimo receivers .",
    "a number of interesting and important problems remain unsolved beyond this paper , such as designing the optimal adc assignment scheme for any snr , especially for the multi - user scenario ; extending the analysis to more comprehensive hardware impairment models beyond adc ; among others . besides , in order to make this approach effective for wideband channels which are more prevailing in the future communication systems , it is particularly crucial to extend the analysis to frequency - selective fading channels .",
