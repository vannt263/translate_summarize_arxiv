    "the experimental study of the kinetic energy of the charge carriers in the high temperature cuprate superconductors ( htcs ) become an important subject in view of the new theoretical approaches predicting that , in the absence of an applied magnetic field , pairing in these materials results from a decrease of the kinetic energy term upon condensation [ 1,2 ] . this prediction is opposite to that of the bcs theory , where the kinetic energy of the carriers increases when the system enters the superconducting state [ 3 ] . experimentally , the situation is less clear because of the relatively small change of the kinetic energy in the condensate with respect to that of the normal state .",
    "optical conductivity measurements in optimally doped and underdoped bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( bi-2212 ) suggests that the observed spectral weight transfer that occurs below the superconducting transition is in agreement with the unconventional scenario of decreasing kinetic energy [ 4 ] . on the other hand , when this cuprate is slightly overdoped , results are rather in accordance with the bcs predictions [ 5 ] .",
    "a simpler situation occurs in a type ii superconductor when a magnetic field is applied . in that case",
    ", it is expected that the kinetic energy of the condensate always increase because of the flux expulsion and vortex formation [ 6 ] .",
    "useful informations may be obtained on the order parameter and other basic properties of type ii superconductors from studies of this energy term [ 7 ] . in the case",
    "discussed here , we are interested in the kinetic energy associated to the currents around the vortices generated by the action of an applied external magnetic field .    theoretically , it was demonstrated from applying the virial theorem in the framework of the ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) theory [ 8 ] that the average kinetic energy density of a large @xmath8 superconductor may be written as [ 6,7 ] @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the equilibrium magnetization and @xmath11 is the magnetic induction . inside a superconducting sample , the induction ( in the si system ) may be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath14 is the applied field and @xmath15 is the sample dependent geometric factor related to the dipolar field .",
    "then , for obtaining the kinetic energy density from magnetization measurements , it is useful to re - write equation ( 1 ) as    @xmath16    the in - field kinectic energy density was determined for some low and high @xmath17 superconductors in the references [ 6],[9 ] and [ 10 ] .",
    "the results reported for nb [ 9 ] and for a pb - in alloy [ 10 ] are in agreement with the expectations derived from the abrikosov treatment of the g - l theory , as well as with general bcs predictions . on the other hand , in cuprates",
    "as optimally doped and underdoped yba@xmath6cu@xmath18o@xmath19 ( ybco ) [ 9 ] , optimally doped bi-2212 [ 9 ] and la@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath22 [ 10 ] an appreciable amount of the in - field kinetic energy subsists up to temperatures well beyond @xmath17 .",
    "authors in references [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] identify this behavior to a pseudogap effect , although the influence of strong thermal fluctuations can not be ruled out as an alternative explanation .    in order to study the differences induced by the microscopic morphology in the kinetic energy , here we report magnetization measurements and in - field kinetic energy density estimations in two different polycrystalline samples of smba@xmath6cu@xmath18o@xmath2 ( sm-123 ) .",
    "the experiments were performed in several applied fields .",
    "however , the extraction of @xmath23 is restricted to the temperature range near @xmath17 , where the equilibrium magnetization can be unambiguously obtained from coincident and reproducible zfc and fc measurements .",
    "results are compared to those obtained in ybco and bi-2212 single crystals [ 9,10 ] .",
    "the magnitude of the kinetic energy of our polycrystalline samples is considerably smaller than that of single crystal samples .",
    "two samples of polycrystalline smba@xmath6cu@xmath18o@xmath2 ( sm-123 ) were independently produced using the solid state reaction method .",
    "the employed procedures are described below .",
    "the precursor compounds sm@xmath6o@xmath18 ( purity 99.99% ) , baco@xmath18 ( purity 99.8% ) and cuo ( purity 99,995% ) were used for the preparation of the samples . for the sample labeled as sm - i ,",
    "the presursors were mixed and macerated during two hours in an agate mortar , pressed at 3 tons into a cilindrical shape and submitted to a calcination process at 850 @xmath24 during 15 hours .",
    "after furnace cooling to room temperature , the resulting pellet was finely powdered again , pressed and subjected to two sintering processes at 870 @xmath24 and 890 @xmath24 for 45 hours each one .",
    "the cylindrical sample was then oxygenated by exposure to an oxygen atmosphere while decreasing the temperature in the range 750 - 250 @xmath24 at rate of 12.5 @xmath25h , then it was furnace cooled to room temperature .",
    "the preparation of sample sm - ii was also done in three steps but using different equipments and thermal processes . in the calcination process ,",
    "the macerated and pressed precursors were heated up to 850 @xmath24 and kept at this temperature during 48 hours .",
    "for the sintering step , the sample was heated up to 900 @xmath24 at 150 @xmath25h , kept at this temperature for 0.1 h , then heated up to 1040 @xmath24 at 60 @xmath25h .",
    "a 24 hours annealing was carried out at this temperature before cooling the sample at -60 @xmath25h to 900 @xmath24 where it was maintained for 0.1 h. subsequently , the sample was cooled down to room temperature at 150 @xmath25h . in the final oxygenation process ,",
    "the sample sm - ii was heated again to 500 @xmath24 and kept at this temperature during 0.1 h. then , it was cooled to 350 @xmath24 and kept at this temperature for 3 days .",
    "after that time , the sample was furnace cooled to room temperature .",
    "electrical resistivity measurements were performed in both samples .",
    "transition temperatures determined from the maximum of the temperature derivative of the resistivity are @xmath26 k for sample sm - i and @xmath27 k for sample sm - ii .",
    "the width of the resistive transition is around 3 k for both samples .",
    "zero field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) magnetization measurements in several applied fields ranging from 1 mt up to 5 t were performed using a xl5-mpms squid magnetometer manufactured by quantum design inc .",
    "results were corrected for the demagnetization effects .",
    "the geometrical factors were estimated by approximating the samples s shape to an ellipsoid and making use of the calculations in reference [ 11 ] .",
    "the porosity of the ceramic samples was also taken into account by comparing their measured densities and the theoretically expected value .",
    "figure 1 shows representative magnetization versus temperature results in a temperature range encompassing the superconducting transition for the two studied samples .",
    "panel ( a ) shows results for sample sm - i and in panel ( b ) are plotted data for sample sm - ii .",
    "experiments were performed according the zfc and fc prescriptions .",

    "the irreversibility temperature _ _ t__@xmath28 is signaled and denotes the splitting of the zfc and fc curves .",

    "figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) collects the characteristic temperatures @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the presence of several applied fields for samples sm - i and sm - ii , respectively .",
    "the area delimited between the curves @xmath31 and @xmath32 defines the reversible region where effects of the pinning energy are negligible .",
    "the field - dependent critical temperatures are determined by the intersection between the linearly extrapolated magnetizations in the normal and superconducting phases , as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "the irreversibility temperatures are determined by subtracting the zfc magnetization from the fc one and applying the criterion used in reference [ 12 ] : the temperature where the difference @xmath33 deviates from the zero baseline defined by the high temperature data is assigned to @xmath32 .",
    "the observed behaviour of @xmath32 on the two samples is typical of polycrystalline samples of htcs [ 13 ] and mimics the observations in spin glass systems . for the sample sm - i , in the low field and high temperature limit , the irreversibility temperatures decrease as a function of the applied field as @xmath34\\sim h^{2/3}$ ] , in analogy to the de almeida - thouless line [ 14 ] . as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , near @xmath35 t , a crossover is observed in @xmath32 to a field dependence with inverse curvature that may be approximately fitted to a gabay - toulouse - like line [ 15 ] given by @xmath34\\sim h^{2}$ ] .",
    "the behaviour observed in fig .",
    "2(a ) was interpreted as the vortex glass analog of the crossover from the high - field gabay - toulouse transition to the low field de almeida - thouless instability observed in heisenberg vector spin glasses [ 16 ] . as shown by fig .",
    "2(b ) for sample sm - ii , a de almeida - thouless - like line describes the irreveribility line in the whole field range in this case . the results in fig .",
    "2 suggest that the effects from granularity are stronger in sample sm - i .",
    "we assume that the g - l theory describes the equilibrium magnetization adequately in most of the reversible superconducting regime of our samples .",
    "then , using the recipe of doria el al . [ 6 ] , in figs .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) we plot the field induced kinectic energy given by equation ( 2 ) as a function of temperature for samples sm - i and sm - ii , respectively .",
    "results for magnetic fields ranging from 0.2 t up to 5 t are shown and the data are restricted to the temperature regime where the magnetization is reversible .",
    "the applied field range in our investigation enlarges significantly the regime studied in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] for ybco . here",
    ", the kinetic energy density approaches linearly to the temperature axis and vanishes for @xmath36 .",
    "we do not observe a significant kinetic energy contribution above @xmath17 , contrasting with the findings reported in ref . [",
    "on the other hand , @xmath37 in sm-123 and ybco are qualitatively similar in the field and temperature range where the comparison is possible , even though results in ybco were obtained for fields applied perpendicular to the cu - o@xmath0 atomic layers of a single crystal sample [ 9 ] .",
    "although the similar field and temperature behavior shown by results for samples sm - i and sm - ii in fig .",
    "3 , these data differ quantitatively . for a given field and temperature , @xmath37 is significantly larger for sample sm - ii .",
    "we attribute this difference to polycrystalinity .",
    "indeed , the different routes employed to prepare our samples likely lead to distinct granular microstrustures and granularity is known to underly the magnetic behavior of polycrystalline samples of the htcs .        in the intermediate field regime , @xmath38 ,",
    "the interaction among the vortices is weak [ 3 ] . in this field region ,",
    "the cooper pair density may be considered uniform inside the sample excepting the vortex positions . in the case of extreme type ii superconductors",
    "( @xmath39 as the htcs , the variation of the order parameter in the vortex positions may be described by delta functions . under such conditions",
    "the magnetization can be calculated with the london approximation to the g - l theory . in this case , the magnetization in si units is [ 17 ] :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the quantum magnetic flux , @xmath42 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath43 is the penetration length and @xmath44 is a constant of order unity .",
    "the substitution of the magnetization given by equation ( 3 ) in equation ( 2 ) yields : @xmath45 fittings of the experimental data to equation ( 4 ) are displayed in fig . 4 for samples sm - i and sm - ii . from these fittings",
    "we estimate the penetration lengths and the upper critical field in the studied field and temperature ranges .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath46 and @xmath47 were corrected according the hao and clem model [ 18 ] and are shown in figs .",
    "5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "according to the mean - field theory , @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the reduced temperature [ 19 ] . in fig .",
    "5 , the values for @xmath51 for samples sm - i and sm - ii are plotted as functions of @xmath52 .",
    "the fitted straigth lines allow us to estimate @xmath53 nm for sample sm - i and @xmath54 nm for sample sm - ii .",
    "these values are within the expected range , since the estimated penetration lenghts are polycrystalline averages enhanced by granularity effects [ 20 ] .",
    "the larger @xmath55 found in sample sm - i also suggests that the influence of granularity is stronger in this sample .    .",
    "]    in fig . 6 , the estimations for @xmath56 extracted from fittings in fig.4 are plotted as a function of the reduced temperature .",
    "data for both samples align to a single straight line . from the slope of line",
    "we deduce that @xmath57 t for sm-123 .",
    "this estimation is in good aggreement with previous determinations of polycrystalline averages of the upper critical induced field in y-123-type superconductors [ 19 ] .",
    "since granularity leads the polycrystalline htcs systems to behave as a superconducting glassy medium [ 21 ] , the in - field kinetic energy in our sm-123 samples may not be enterely accounted by the london approximation to the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "so , one might consider that a complete description of the kinetic energy in granular htcs should include the contributions of josephson vortices [ 22 ] and intergrain chiralities [ 23 ] .",
    "however , as a first approximation , equation ( 4 ) furnishes a fairly good descrition of the data , showing that the intragrain vortices are indeed the dominant contribution to the condensate kinetic energy in sm-123 in the investigated field - temperature range .",
    "we studied experimentally the reversible magnetization and the field - induced kinetic energy density in two polycrystalline samples of the smba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath58 cuprate superconductor .",
    "analysis were restricted to the temperature range nearly below @xmath17 , where the zfc and fc magnetization are coincident .",
    "fields up to 5 t were applied .    the theory proposed by m. doria and co - workers [ 6,7 ] which is based on the application of the virial theorem to the ginzburg - landau free energy",
    "was used to describe the kinetic energy density in our samples .",
    "the magnitude of the kinetic energy was found larger for sample sm - ii than for sample sm - i .",
    "we attributed this difference to the enhanced granularity effects in sample sm - i .",
    "the identified contribution to the kinetic energy in both samples were attributed to intragrain vortices .",
    "results could be interpreted by assuming the validity of london approximation to the gizburg - landau theory .",
    "the penetration length and the upper critical field were calculated for both samples .",
    "the obtained values are similar to those found in previous studies .",
    "the penetration lenght estimations corroborate the enhanced effects of granularity in sample sm - i .    as a final conclusion",
    ", our results and analysis showed that the study of the in - field kinetic energy may improve the usual description of the magnetic response of superconductors based solely on magnetization results in the temperature range approaching @xmath29 , where the pinning effects are inexistent .",
