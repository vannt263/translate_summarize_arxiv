    "current rectification , also known as the diode effect , occurs whenever the transport characteristics in electronic conductors are asymmetric under the application of the driving voltage .",
    "this asymmetry can have various origins .",
    "best known perhaps is the mismatch of band structures in macroscopic diodes , which leads to a potential wall that blocks the motion of the particles in one direction , while it is not seen by the particles moving in the opposite direction .    in the last years ,",

    "arises when the particle interaction is strong enough that a single  particle description becomes invalid .",
    "this naturally occurs in one  dimensional systems , for which a luttinger liquid behavior is expected .",
    "it has been known for some time now@xcite that in such systems the current is strongly affected by the presence of impurities , even when they are weak , due to their renormalization by the electron  electron interactions .",
    "one can thus expect that asymmetries in the impurity distribution leads to strongly asymmetric current  voltage curves .",
    "this issue was addressed very recently in the framework of luttinger liquids of spinless particles@xcite .",
    "rectification current _ @xmath3/2 $ ] can be measured as the dc response to a low - frequency square voltage wave of amplitude @xmath4 and expresses the asymmetry of the @xmath5 curve for forward and reverse bias .",
