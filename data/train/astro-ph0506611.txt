    "the number of theoretical papers discussing or incorporating galactic winds has grown sharply in recent years .",
    "superwinds have been invoked to explain a myriad of issues relating to contemporary cosmology @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations and semi - analytic models typically incorporate simplified prescriptions for superwinds , rather than detailed microphysics .",
    "this is appropriate not only due to the current level of computing power , but also because hydrodynamic simulations of superwinds can not yet accurately predict many large - scale properties of the outflows .",
    "thus , theorists depend on observers to demonstrate the macroscopic behavior of real outflows over a range of galaxy types and environments .    previous large surveys of local starburst galaxies have shown that superwinds are common .",
    "@xcite undertook an imaging and spectroscopic survey of @xmath950 edge - on galaxies with infrared luminosities @xmath10  l_@xmath11  and redshifts @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "evidence for superwinds in these galaxies includes : extended line emission , shock - like line ratios , broad emission lines , velocity shear , and blue emission line asymmetries .",
    "several of these properties also show a positive correlation with infrared activity ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xcite find that the average ( deprojected ) outflow speed of the ionized gas in these galaxies is @xmath14  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "using the complementary technique of optical absorption - line spectroscopy , @xcite studied a sample of 32 infrared - luminous galaxies with @xmath15 .",
    "their survey includes galaxies whose luminosities are dominated by a starburst as well as some powered by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "they include galaxies with a range of luminosities , including five ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; l_@xmath16  @xmath17  l_@xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite also find that the detection rate of winds is high .",
    "they show that the outflows are dusty , and measure outflow velocities up to @xmath18  km  s@xmath1 ; however , they do not measure an individual mass outflow rate for each galaxy and fit only a single velocity component to each absorption feature .",
    "most recently , detailed absorption - line studies of @xmath19 ulirgs @xcite have found that the detection rate of winds in ulirgs is higher than that in luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; l_@xmath16  @xmath20  l_@xmath11 ) .",
    "these studies show that ulirgs have high mass outflow rates , of tens to hundreds of m",
    "_  ^-1m@xmath5  yr@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite also argues that wind velocity scales with star formation rate and galactic mass .    at higher redshifts ,",
    "directly studying winds is possible only using deep observations of bright or gravitationally - lensed galaxies .",
    "one of the best - studied high - redshift galaxy populations is the lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "extensive spectroscopic observations of lbgs have shown that most of them host high - velocity outflows @xcite .",
    "lyman-@xmath21 emission is redshifted ( perhaps due to resonant scattering on the receding half of the outflow ) , while uv absorption lines are blueshifted due to interstellar absorption in the outflow .",
    "the average offset of the two is 614  km  s@xmath1  @xcite , implying that an average ( projected ) outflow velocity is approximately 300  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "early evidence suggested that these outflows are quite large ( @xmath22  kpc ) and metal - enriched @xcite , but more recent work has revised the probable sizes of these outflows to more modest radii ( @xmath23  kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "though the observational data set on outflows is steadily increasing , both in quality and quantity , it is in many ways still quite limited .",
    "over most of cosmic history , the frequency of occurrence and impact of superwinds remains unquantified .",
    "we also know very little about how the properties of superwinds depend on the properties of their host galaxies .",
    "observations have typically focused on dwarf galaxies or edge - on disk galaxies with moderate star formation rates ( as a well as a set of high - redshift galaxies with as yet uncertain properties ) .",
    "ulirgs are of special interest , as they may host over 50% of global star formation at @xmath24 @xcite . by studying ulirgs in the local universe",
    ", we can learn how winds are affecting the cosmos at high redshift , when many of the present - day stars were formed and much of the metal enrichment of the igm may have occurred .",
    "these observations are needed in part to inform theoretical prescriptions of winds in numerical simulations .",
    "many theorists assume that the mass outflow rate in the wind and star formation rate in the corresponding host galaxy are comparable and linearly proportional to each other ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the ratio of the mass outflow rate to the star formation rate in a galaxy is generically unity .",
    "this is presumably based on the claim of some observers that this is so , for luminous infrared galaxies @xcite and dwarfs or spirals @xcite .",
    "however , preliminary data from our pilot study suggests that this ratio is an order of magnitude lower in ulirgs @xcite , at least for the neutral gas phase .",
    "the role of this work is to fill in the gaps mentioned above and produce a systematic study of large - scale outflows .",
    "we have made the largest survey to date of massive outflows in infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "our survey includes over 100 galaxies and extends over a broad redshift range ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have included 78 starburst galaxies with a wide range of properties and , for the first time , searched for superwinds in a large number ( 43 ) of starburst - dominated ulirgs .",
    "( in a forthcoming paper , we discuss observations of 26 ulirgs which have seyfert nuclei and compare them to the starburst ulirgs ; @xcite . )",
    "the existence of outflows can be inferred from the presence of absorption lines that are blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "we apply this technique using moderately high resolution spectroscopy ( fwhm  @xmath26  km  s@xmath1 ) of the  d  @xmath27 doublet .",
    "our observations were obtained with echelle and long - slit spectrographs on the keck ii , mmt , and kpno 4 m telescopes .",
    "we perform detailed profile fitting using multiple velocity components and assuming a gaussian in optical depth ; from these fits we measure velocity , velocity width , optical depth , covering fraction , and column density for each component .",
    "the details of the sample selection , observations , and data reduction are discussed in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in paper",
    "i , we also present the absorption- and emission - line spectra and a discussion of the absorption - line fitting .",
    "the size and makeup of our sample allows us to study the properties of these winds as a function of host galaxy properties over a large dynamic range .",
    "wind properties that we can measure include : velocity ; mass , momentum , energy , and their outflow rates ; and mass entrainment efficiency , which is a measure of the relative efficiency with which these winds entrain interstellar gas clouds .",
    "the relevant galaxy properties are discussed in paper i , and include star formation rate , optical and near - infrared luminosity , circular velocity , spectral type , and redshift .    in   [ dv]@xmath4[cf ] , we describe in detail the distributions of velocity , optical depth , column density , and covering fraction in our sample .

    "we summarize in  [ concl ] .    for all calculations ,",
    "we assume present - day values for the cosmological parameters of @xmath28  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 and the standard @xmath29 , @xmath30 cosmology .",

    "in this section , we discuss our measurements of outflow properties . table [ avgprop ] lists the average outflow properties for our three subsamples . table [ objprop ] lists the outflow properties of each galaxy .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the full sample of 78 galaxies is divided into three subsamples based on infrared luminosity and redshift : ( a )  the irgs ( infrared galaxies ) , with l_@xmath16  @xmath31  l_@xmath11 ; ( b )  the low-@xmath32 ulirgs , with l_@xmath16  @xmath17  l_@xmath11  and @xmath33 ; and ( c )  the high-@xmath32 ulirgs , with l_@xmath16  @xmath17  l_@xmath11  and @xmath34 .",
    "these outflow quantities are calculated from the fitted parameters of the  d  feature in each galaxy , as listed in the tables of paper i. paper i describes the details of the  d  fitting procedure . in short ,",
    "we fit multiple velocity components to the  d  feature in each object .",
    "the large velocity dispersions in the galaxies we observe cause the components of the  d  doublet , as well as velocity components if there are more than one , to blend with one another .",

    "we assume gaussians in optical depth , which translates into observable non - gaussian intensity profiles for optical depths greater than unity .",

    "the measured parameters resulting from our fits are : outflow velocity , @xmath35 ; doppler width , @xmath36 ; central optical depth of the  d@xmath37 line , @xmath38 ; and the covering fraction , c_f@xmath39",
    ". the errors in these parameters are determined using monte carlo simulations .    in paper",
    "i , we also dicuss the method of computation of the  and h column densities from these fitted parameters .",
    "the values of @xmath40 ( ) and @xmath40(h ) for each galaxy are listed in table 4 of paper i.      the current survey contains over @xmath41 more starburst galaxies than previous superwind surveys of infrared sources @xcite .",
    "it also has a much higher number of ulirgs ( 43 vs. @xmath4220 ) .",
    "we are thus in a better position to quantify the frequency of occurrence of winds in ulirgs , especially as a function of galaxy properties .",
    "we use a velocity cutoff of @xmath43  km  s@xmath1  to delineate galaxies with superwinds , a slightly more liberal cutoff than in our pilot study ( in which we used @xmath44  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "velocity components blueshifted by more than 50  km  s@xmath1  are assumed to be outflowing .",
    "this cutoff is chosen to avoid contamination due to systematic errors and measurement errors in wavelength calibration ( @xmath4510  km  s@xmath1 ) , line fitting ( 10  km  s@xmath1  on average ) , and redshift determination ( 15  km  s@xmath1 ) .",

    "the high-@xmath32 ulirgs also show a lower detection rate than the low-@xmath32 ulirgs ; we discuss this further in  [ zevol ] .    applying this same cutoff to the galaxies in @xcite that are optically classified as galaxies or liners and have l_@xmath16  @xmath31  l_@xmath11 ,",

    "this could indicate some dependence of detection rate on the presence of a major interaction ; however , without detailed morphological studies of the galaxies in our sample , this result is inconclusive .    in short",

    "other evidence for superwinds comes from emission - line and x - ray data , which show minor - axis extensions , bubble - like and bow shock structures , kinematic broadening and/or line - splitting , shock - like emission line ratios , and/or tight correlations between optical and x - ray emitting filaments .",
    "most recently , diffuse and extended x - ray - emitting gas has been discovered in perhaps the best - studied merger , the antennae ; this gas may have a superwind origin @xcite",
    ".    however , the large opening angles we infer for ulirg winds ( @xmath265 ) are not obviously consistent with the picture of a biconical superwind .",
    "alternatively , there may be multiple superwind episodes of this kind over a short period of time , which will fill out the area surrounding the galaxy .",
    "one of the original purposes of this study was to explore the properties of superwinds deeper into redshift space .",
    "given that the number density of ulirgs evolves strongly upward with increasing redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect that winds from ulirgs had a strong impact on the intergalactic medium and galaxy evolution at @xmath266 .",
    "however , this assumes that the properties of winds in ulirgs do not change with @xmath32 .",
    "apart from our study , there are currently no observations of winds in ulirgs outside of the local universe , except in a single hyperluminous infrared galaxy at high redshift @xcite .",
    "we have partially accomplished this goal by observing a substantial number of galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath267 .",
    "we do observe differences between our high-@xmath32 and low-@xmath32 subsamples .",
    "notably , winds are less frequently observed in the high-@xmath32 ulirgs ( with a detection rate of @xmath268 vs. @xmath269 for the low-@xmath32 ulirgs ) , and less efficiently entrain gas ( with a lower median @xmath152 than the low-@xmath32 ulirgs by a factor of 2 ) . however , the high-@xmath32 galaxies have higher star formation rates ( or equivalently , luminosities ) than the low-@xmath32 ulirgs , on average ( 389  m _  ^-1m@xmath5  yr@xmath1  and 225  m _  ^-1m@xmath5  yr@xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "this is a selection effect , since the most distant ulirgs observed by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) are necessarily those with the highest intrinsic luminosities .    the differences in mass entrainment efficiency between the low- and high-@xmath32 subsamples are primarily a result of the variation of @xmath152 with sfr at high star formation rates (  [ mme_v ] ) , rather than redshift evolution . in other words , the average mass entrainment efficiency in our high-@xmath32 ulirgs is lower simply because they follow a trend of @xmath152 vs. sfr that is independent of redshift ( at least for @xmath270 ) .",
    "the change in the rate of wind detection is less certainly attributable to sfr variations .",
    "it is quite possible that the wind frequency of occurrence drops above a certain star formation rate .",
    "other factors may also play a role ; for instance , more extended continuum light in a distant galaxy may leak into the slit and wash out the  d  absorption line .",
    "the high-@xmath32 spectra generally have lower s / n than those of nearer galaxies , as well , diminishing our ability to detect  d. finally , the global wind covering factor in the highest - luminosity starbursts may simply be lower (  [ gcf ] ) .    assuming that the relationships between wind properties and galaxy properties , as well as the properties of ulirg winds , remain constant with redshift",
    ", the cosmological impact of winds in ulirgs depends largely on their density evolution .",
    "studies to date ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the number density of ulirgs rises strongly with increasing redshift and that they host a large fraction of star formation at @xmath266 .",
    "thus , we expect that winds in ulirgs , since they are common , massive , and energetic , have the potential to strongly impact the intergalactic and intracluster medium at redshifts @xmath781 .",
    "properly assessing their actual impact , however , will require a better understanding of how much of their gas escapes into the igm / icm .",
    "the highest redshift winds ( at @xmath271 ) have higher velocities than those in galaxies of comparable sfr in the local universe (  [ dv ] ) .",
    "however , their global covering factors may be similar (  [ gcf ] ) .",
    "the higher velocities may reflect a difference in the structure of these early star forming galaxies or their surroundings from those of today .",
    "we have surveyed 78 starburst - dominated infrared - luminous galaxies , the largest systematic study to date of superwinds at @xmath0 .",
    "our primary goal has been to study the detection rate and properties of winds as a function of the properties of the winds host galaxies .",
    "this provides insights into the physics and properties of superwinds that studies of individual galaxies do not allow .",
    "furthermore , by studying a large sample of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , we can quantify how superwinds affect galaxy evolution and the intergalactic medium at high redshift , where ulirgs may host most of the star formation in the universe @xcite .    *",
    "( 1 ) detection rate .",
    "* we find that superwinds are present in almost all infrared - luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "our detection rates are 43% and 70% for our irg ( @xmath272 ) subsample and ulirgs , respectively .",
    "however , these detection rates are lower limits to the actual frequency of occurrence of outflows in these galaxies and also to the opening angle of the outflows . because wind opening angles in local disk galaxies ( as a fraction of 4@xmath209 ) equal the detection rate in our irg subsample , we assume that these winds are found in almost all of our sample and that the detection rate exclusively reflects the wind geometry .",
    "we thus compute that the global covering factor of neutral gas outflows is higher in ulirgs ( @xmath273 ) than in lirgs ( @xmath274 ) .",
    "the opening angle of high-@xmath32 starbursts is uncertain , but may be close to several tenths of 4@xmath209 , similar to the irgs @xcite .    at the highest star formation rates , the detection rate in ulirgs decreases ( from 80% to 46% ) .",
    "however , the overall trend is for detection rate to increase with sfr .",
    "detection rate does _ not _ depend on optical or near - infrared luminosity , galactic mass , spectral type , or on the merger stage in ulirgs .",
    "some of the absorption we detect is related to overlapping gas disks in a multiple system or to tidal debris ; these components are removed from the formal analysis . in a handful of cases",
    "we can demonstrate that these explanations are more likely than the outflow hypothesis .",
    "however , most alternative explanations should produce a roughly symmetric velocity distribution or one skewed to the red , and the one that we observe in our data has a strong blueward asymmetry .",
    "the number of outflowing components that we can attribute to these alternative explanations is at most a mirror image of the distribution of red components , and thus much less than the total number of blueshifted components .    *",
    "( 2 ) velocity .",
    "* the maximum velocities for these winds range from 150 to 600  km  s@xmath1  ( and up to 1100  km  s@xmath1  in a single case ) , with a median value of 350  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of velocities is not consistent with a simple constant - velocity model of projection effects .",
    "the velocity of the gas with the highest column density in each galaxy has a median value of 140  km  s@xmath1 , less than half that of v_max@xmath68 .",
    "the average projected velocities of ionized gas in local edge - on starbursts of sfr comparable to the irgs ( @xmath9170  km  s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) are higher than the average value of v_maxn@xmath61  in irgs ( 100  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "high - redshift starbursts of star formation rate similar to the irgs have higher mean velocities than both the irgs _ and _ the ulirgs : @xmath9300  km  s@xmath1 , vs. @xmath45200  km  s@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the maximum velocities we measure are often close to or slightly larger than the escape velocity of the galaxy .",
    "the escape fraction of neutral gas is thus non - zero when averaged over the entire sample : @xmath275 .",
    "furthermore , we often observe higher velocities in the ionized gas ( as probed by emission lines ) , which has velocities exceeding 1000  km  s@xmath1  in several galaxies .",
    "we show that liners have higher median values of v_max@xmath68  and doppler width @xmath36 ( by @xmath9100  km  s@xmath1 ) than galaxies .",
    "thus , the spectral classification for these systems , based on line ratios , may simply reflect high - velocity vs. low - velocity shocks .",
    "we also show that for ulirgs , wind velocity may increase as the merger progresses ( though the statistics are admittedly low ) .",
    "the outflow velocities in starbursts rise slowly with star formation rate , luminosity , and galactic mass when we consider both dwarf starbursts @xcite and luminous galaxies .",
    "however , in our sample alone , velocity is independent of galaxy properties .",
    "this is consistent with a limit to the terminal velocity of neutral gas clouds above an sfr of @xmath145  m _",
    "^-1m@xmath5  yr@xmath1  @xcite",
    ". however , detailed models of ram pressure driven clouds which incorporate this limit are not consistent with our data @xcite .",
    "models of radiation pressure driven gas are presently underconstrained @xcite .    *",
    "( 3 ) mass , momentum , energy .",
    "* we find that mass , momentum , energy , and their outflow rates depend on star formation rate roughly linearly , though these relationships flatten at high sfr ( @xmath310@xmath4100  m _",
    "^-1m@xmath5  yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "this dependence is consistent with ram pressure driving of a hot gas or radiation pressure driving , since both the supernova rate and the galaxy luminosity scale with sfr .",
    "modulo the flattening at high sfr , the dependence of energy on star formation rate is sfr@xmath276 , suggesting that galaxies with sfr  @xmath9  10@xmath4100  m _",
    "^-1m@xmath5  yr@xmath1  have higher thermalization efficiency than lower - sfr galaxies , or accelerate the cold gas more effectively and thus have fractionally less energy in other wind phases .",
    "these wind properties correlate also with on galaxy luminosity and mass .",
    "the relationships to galactic mass are quite strong , with power law slopes of @xmath277 .",
    "thus , the wind properties are sensitive to the galaxy mass . however , the winds get larger and more powerful with increasing mass , rather than smaller .    at high sfr , luminosity , and galactic mass ,",
    "we observe a flattening in the increase of wind properties ( velocity , mass , momentum , and energy ) with galaxy properties .",
    "this flattening may be due to entrainment of all the available gas clouds , the existence of a terminal velocity in ulirgs above which the wind can not be accelerated , and/or a reduction in thermalization efficiency at high sfr ( perhaps due to the interception of the wind by dense ambient material , like the massive quantities of molecular gas feeding the starburst ) .",
    "the magnitudes of mass , momentum , energy , and their outflow rates in neutral gas are compared to those in the hot gas , as predicted by starburst models @xcite .",
    "we find that the range of entrainment factors in the wind , @xmath278 , is @xmath90.01@xmath410 , with an average of a few .",
    "the measured momenta are , on average , a factor of @xmath910 less than , and rarely greater than , the momentum in the hot wind .",
    "they are sometimes greater than the momentum available from radiation pressure , however , suggesting that , in many galaxies , the hot wind is likely to dominate the driving of the wind rather than radiation pressure .",
    "the measured energies in the neutral gas are significantly less than the energy in the hot wind on average , by factors of @xmath91@xmath41000 ; thus , the hot wind must carry most of the wind s energy and/or the thermalization efficiency must on average be small ( @xmath4510% ) , especially in dwarf galaxies .    the mass entrainment efficiency , @xmath279sfr , is found to range from @xmath280 but is roughly @xmath281 on average",
    ". these numbers , however , are sensitive to the wind s geometry and the local physics .",
    "this quantity is independent of galaxy properties on average but declines with star formation rate at sfr  @xmath3  10@xmath4100  m _",
    "^-1m@xmath5  yr@xmath1  and with @xmath282 at @xmath7 .",
    "the large observed range of @xmath152 and the dependence on sfr / luminosity show that the prescriptions and assumptions employed in numerical simulations of galaxy formation are not completely correct .",
    "these prescriptions typically assume a constant @xmath152 of approximately unity .    * ( 4 ) outlook*. there is evidence for starburst - driven superwinds in local infrared - luminous mergers such as ngc 6240 . however , the complex kinematics of the ionized gas in these galaxies make it sometimes difficult to distinguish starburst - driven winds from tidal motions directly produced by the interaction . in this sense ,",
    "our data provides the most unambiguous evidence to date for frequent , massive , and energetic outflows in these systems .    to interpret our data more completely ,",
    "however , we require better knowledge of local merging systems .",
    "hydrodynamic modeling of winds in evolving environments such as these would allow comparison of observational data to numerical models , as is possible in more quiescent systems .",
    "more sensitive observations to probe the morphology and kinematics of faint structures in these galaxies , and three - dimensional kinematic observations of multiple gas phases will also help to disentangle the motions of different components ( e.g. , tidal tails vs. expanding superbubbles ) as has been done for arp 220 @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of the neutral phase of these outflows is also needed , especially its geometry and small - scale structure .",
    "we need to know how the clouds in these winds are distributed , and how they stand up under radiation , evaporation , and shock ablation .",
    "understanding these better will enable us to more precisely measure the properties and fate of these clouds from global measurements .",
    "many ulirgs have infrared luminosities which are dominated by dust - reprocessed radiation from an agn , rather than a starburst .",
    "agn also power outflows , and it would be instructive to compare the properties of outflows in starburst - dominated ulirgs and agn - dominated ulirgs . in a forthcoming paper ,",
    "we present  d  observations of 26 ulirgs with seyfert nuclei and perform this comparison @xcite .",
