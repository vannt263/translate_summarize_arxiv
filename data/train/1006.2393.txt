    "the finite temperature effects are much less severe for @xmath110 .",
    "they only lead to a reduction of @xmath92 by about 25 % but clearly improve the description of the data .",
    "we conclude that finite temperature effects can not resolve the question of the different values for @xmath67 in the three - body recombination and dimer - relaxation data .",
    "moreover , while finite temperature effects are important , a qualitative description of the data at @xmath150 nk can be already achieved with a zero temperature calculation .",
    "in this work , we have studied efimov physics in atom - dimer relaxation of @xmath0li atoms in the three lowest hyperfine states using the universal zero - range theory .",
    "two resonances were observed at magnetic fields 603  g and 685  g in the relaxation rate @xmath92 in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "these resonances are consequences of two efimov trimers close to the atom - dimer threshold .",
    "their positions have been predicted by braaten _",
    "et al._@xcite . the measured position of the resonance at 685  g @xcite , which is well within the universal region , is larger than the prediction by about 30% .",
    "this is consistent with an error of order 10% error due to effective range corrections .",
    "however , the value @xmath69 extracted from the three - body recombination data is not able to describe the atom - dimer relaxation data which require the larger value @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the larger value of @xmath67 in dimer relaxation compared to the value from recombination data is not understood .",
    "however , we note that a similar discrepancy between the values of @xmath67 from atom - dimer relaxation and three - body recombination occurs in the bosonic systems of @xmath12cs atoms @xcite .    using the value @xmath110 , our zero temperature calculation is able to describe the data qualitatively . in the vicinity of this resonance",
    ", we have also performed an approximate finite temperature calculation and find sizable temperature effects that can suppress the relaxation rate by an order of magnitude if @xmath69 .",
    "for the larger value @xmath110 , however , these effects lead to a moderate suppression of about 25% , such that zero temperature results are useful as a first approximation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , also two local minima at 610  g and 695  g are discovered in the rate @xmath119 .",
    "those minima can be associated with destructive interference between different recombination channels  @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show that the partial rate into 23-dimers is responsible for the minima but the positions of the minima are displaced by -10  g and + 20  g from the measurements .",
    "these displacements correspond to a 30% shift in terms of the scattering length compared to our predictions .",
    "since the scattering length , @xmath80 , is about a factor two larger in this magnetic field region than around the resonance in @xmath92 , one would expect smaller corrections here .",
    "the observed shifts indicate that the destructive interference leading to the minima might be dominated by wave numbers @xmath10 larger than @xmath151 such that corrections of order @xmath152 are important .",
    "moreover , finite temperature effects could fill the minima in an asymmetric fashion .",
    "the total rate @xmath112 shows no structure .",
    "however , the partial rate into the 23-dimer shows a local minimum near 600  g. in the total rate this feature is hidden by the dominant rate into the @xmath102-dimer .    in order to better understand the discrepancy between the values of @xmath67 and the resonance positions extracted from three - body recombination and atom - dimer relaxation two important improvements are required in a future analysis .",
    "first , a full finite temperature calculation of atom - dimer relaxation should be carried out .",
    "this requires calculating atom - dimer scattering above the dimer breakup thresholds and in higher partial waves . due to the different pair scattering lengths in the three channels ,",
    "such a calculation is considerably more complex than in the case of identical bosons @xcite .",
    "however , it will allow to better distinguish effects from the resonance width parameter @xmath67 and from the finite temperature which can be partially traded for each other @xcite .",
    "second , an analysis of the effective range corrections should be performed in order to describe the observed shifts in the resonance positions quantitatively . a similar analysis for systems of identical bosons",
    "was carried out in refs .",
