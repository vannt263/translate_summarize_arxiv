    "the lifetime of @xmath8 was given by several experiments@xcite .",
    "the widths of the nonleptonic decay @xmath9@xcite as well as the semileptonic decay @xmath10 were measured@xcite@xcite . besides , the branching ratios of two - body decays such as @xmath11@xcite ,  @xmath12 and @xmath13@xcite have been listed in pdg s booklet .",
    "cdf has measured decay widths of @xmath14 and @xmath15 since 2010@xcite .",
    "all of these measurements help to test theoretical studies for heavy baryons .",
    "although the heavy quark symmetries can be used to simplify the physical processes where heavy hadrons are involved , in most cases hqet itself can not give the final phenomenological predictions for the decay properties .",
    "hence one still has to adopt nonperturbative qcd models in the end . among them",
    ", there are qcd sum rules , the bethe - salpeter  ( bs ) equation , the chiral perturbation theory , the potential model , the bag model , the instanton model , the relativistic and nonrelativistic quark models , etc .. applying these models one can calculate weak transition form factors for , for instance , @xmath0 , and consequently the semileptonic decay width directly because the lepton pair can be separated from the hadronic weak transition .",

    "with hqet , the bs equation has already been applied to the heavy hadron systems . in the limit @xmath32",
    ", we found that the bs equations for the heavy baryons @xmath34 are greatly simplified .",
    "when the quark mass is very heavy compared with the qcd scale , @xmath35 , the light degrees of freedom in a heavy baryon @xmath34 become blind to the flavor and spin quantum numbers of the heavy quark because of the @xmath6 symmetries .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum and the flavor quantum numbers of the light degrees of freedom become good quantum numbers that can be used to classify heavy baryons , and @xmath34 corresponds to the state in which the angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom is zero .",
    "so it is natural to regard the heavy baryon as composed of one heavy quark and a light diquark .",
    "when @xmath3 corrections are taken into account , since the isospin of @xmath34 is zero , the isospin of the light degrees of freedom is also zero , therefore , the spin of the light degrees of freedom should also be zero in order to guarantee that the total wave function of @xmath34 is antisymmetric .",
    "hence the spin and isospin of the light degrees of freedom are still fixed even when @xmath3 corrections are taken into account .",
    "therefore , we still treat @xmath34 as composed of a heavy quark and a scalar light diquark . in this picture , we established the bs equations of @xmath34 to second order in the @xmath36 expansion assuming the kernel contains two parts , a scalar confinement term and a one - gluon - exchange term . in the present work , we will apply the bs equation to calculate the semileptonic and nonleptonic decay widths to second order in the @xmath36 expansion .",

    "as we discussed in introduction , @xmath34 is regarded as a bound state of a heavy quark and a light scalar diquark .",

    "<S> the matrix element of the weak transition  @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of six form factors .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 can be regarded as composed of a heavy quark  @xmath2 and a diquark which is made up of the remaining two light quarks . in this picture , we express these six form factors in terms of bethe - salpeter wave functions to second order in the @xmath3 expansion . with the kernel containing both the scalar confinement and the one - gluon - exchange terms we calculate the form factors and the decay widths of the semileptonic decay @xmath4 as well as nonleptonic decays @xmath5 numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we also add qcd corrections since they are comparable with @xmath3 corrections . </S>"
