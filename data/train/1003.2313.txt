    "about 95% of the energy budget of the universe consists of `` dark ''  and unknown  components .",
    "this is a strong motivation for considering and studying hidden sectors beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "gravitational effects of dark matter can not reveal the mass of its constitutents , and indeed a wide variety of mass ranges , from the inverse galactic size to the super - planckian scales , is conceivable . while many models that possess stable particles with masses comparable to the sm energy scales have been a subject of incessant theoretical and experimental activity , models with light sub - ev mass scale dark matter received far less attention .",
    "below the ev mass scale the dark matter would have to be of integer spin , and be produced non - thermally .",
    "the only chance of detecting such dark matter non - gravitationally would occur if such particles are converted into electromagnetic radiation in the external fields or they modify the interaction stength of sm particles .",
    "but if light dark matter interacts with the sm , then immediately its lightness comes to question as the quantum loops with sm particle may easily destabilize the mass scale .",
    "a prominent particle in this category is the qcd axion @xcite that interacts with the sm currents derivatively , @xmath2 , and has its tiny mass generated by the non - perturbative qcd effects protected at any loop level . because of the pseudoscalar nature of @xmath3 and its derivative couplings",
    ", it does not generate a long - range attractive force .    a very natural question to ask",
    "is whether sm allows for couplings to other types of sub - ev dark matter fields that lead to additional observable effects .",
    "for a recent review of the light sector phenomenology see , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . real scalar field @xmath0 and the vector field @xmath4",
    "provide such opportunities with their couplings to the sm fields via the so - called higgs and vector portals : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the higgs doublet , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are parameters and @xmath9 is some locally conserved sm current , such as hypercharge of baryon current . if there is some initial value for @xmath0 or @xmath4 fields with respect to their zero energy configurations , one can source part / all of the universe s energy density from the coherent oscillations around the minimum .",
    "the perils of low mass scale stabilization are immediately apparent in eq .",
    "( [ portals ] ) . indeed , any loops of the sm fields would tend to induce the correction to the mass of @xmath0 field @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the highest energy scale in the problem serving as the ultra - violet cutoff .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 should be taken to incredibly small values , making this portal irrelevant for the phenomenology of sub - ev dark matter .",
    "in contrast , the vector portals and the super - renormalizable higgs portal , @xmath12 , allow to avoid problems with technical naturallness . in the latter case loop corrections scale only as @xmath13 , while the quadratic divergences affect only the term linear in @xmath0 , which can typically be absorbed in an overall field shift . in this paper",
    "we examine generic consequences of this coupling for the sub - ev scalar dark matter , leaving vector dark matter to future studies .",
    "the specific case of a singlet scalar @xmath0 coupled via a super - renormalizable term of the type @xmath14 , ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , has been mostly studied in connection with electroweak and gev - scale phenomenology , with a notable exception of @xcite , where a possibility of super - weakly interacting higgs - coupled dark matter was pointed out .",
    "the scalar potential in the model of interest reads as : @xmath15 this model is explicitly renormalizable and does not require any additional uv completion ( if one is willing to tolerate the usual fine - tuning problem with @xmath16 itself ) .",
    "we chose to redifine away possible linear terms in @xmath0 by shifting the field , and absorbing @xmath17 into @xmath16 .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the two fields acquire a vacuum expectation value , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 gev . the potential ( [ potential ] ) has a stable minimum only if @xmath22 , which is what we assume in the following ; otherwise , it develops a runaway direction in the @xmath23 plane unless additional nonlinear @xmath24 terms are introduced .",
    "the low energy dynamics is encoded in the two physical fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 , defined as @xmath27 and with lagrangian @xmath28    as already noted , higgs loops give only logarithmically divergent corrections to @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the requirement of technical naturalness bounds the scale of @xmath29 from below by the coupling @xmath7 . in summary , by defining the dimensionless ratio @xmath30 , we assume @xmath31 and @xmath32 , although also values @xmath33 will be considered .",
    "the singlet @xmath26 couples to sm particles through the mixing with the higgs field . depending on the mass @xmath29 and coupling @xmath7 , the @xmath26-mediated attractive force can produce testable deviations from @xmath34-gravitational force as well as composition dependence , thus violating the equivalence principle ( ep ) .",
    "the leading contributions to @xmath26-couplings mediated by the @xmath26-higgs propagator is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the @xmath26-couplings are suppressed with respect to the higgs couplings by a factor of @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the effective dimensionless coupling of the higgs to @xmath38-particle at very low momentum tranfer .",
    "therefore , the effective lagrangian describing the interactions with the sm gauge and fermion fields takes the following form : @xmath39    in the above , @xmath40 are the yukawa couplings to fermions .",
    "those can either be fundamental , as the sm couplings to quarks and leptons , @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the mass of the quark ( lepton ) under consideration , or effective , as in the case of the nucleons .",
    "the latter includes the contributions from all heavy quarks contributing to the coupling to gluons @xmath45 that provide a dominant contribution in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "below the qcd scale , the estimate of the effective yukawa coupling of the higgs to nucleons is rather uncertain due to a poorly known strangeness content of the nucleon in the @xmath46 channel : @xmath47 this is much larger than the naive contribution of up and down quarks .",
    "the violation of ep is evident from the fact that the electrons and nucleons have couplings to the @xmath26 field that do not scale exactly with masses , @xmath48    the effective coupling of the higgs to the electromagnetic field , @xmath49 , is obtained by integrating out heavy charged particles , and the question of which one is  heavy \" depends on the characteristic @xmath50 of ( virtual ) photons . the coupling @xmath49 can be written in the following form ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath51 where summation goes over the quark and lepton fields with charges @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the last term is due to the the @xmath54-bosons . for the purpose of calculating the @xmath55 decay",
    ", one has to sum over @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "corrections coming from the light quark sector are subdominant , because in the chiral limit they contribute at two - loops . in practice",
    ", their contribution would amount to at most 10% correction . including these fermion contributions",
    "gives @xmath58 .",
    "for the purpose of calculating the coupling of @xmath26 to nuclei when the em fraction of energy is taken into account , electrons should not be included in the sum , and muon contribution should include a form - factor .",
    "we are not going to pursue this calculation , because it turns out that @xmath59 provides a subleading contribution to the ep violation .",
    "field @xmath26 mediates a fifth force of range @xmath60 .",
    "more precisely , at the newtonian level of approximation , the total effective gravitational potential between two bodies @xmath7 and @xmath61 at relative distance @xmath62 , presents a yukawa contribution due to the interaction of the long range field @xmath26 , @xmath63 the scalar couplings @xmath64 can be expressed in terms of the log - derivative of the masses as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath67 includes terms in the lagrangian that are bilinear in the fields and couple to @xmath26 , such as those in eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) .",
    "when calculating @xmath68 , one should consider the leading universal contribution from the nucleons and all the corrections that are specific to the element @xmath7 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the main , species - independent part of the nuclear mass is given by @xmath69 , and the universal coupling @xmath64 is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) , ( [ nucleons ] ) and ( [ alphaa ] ) : @xmath70     +    in the limit of a very long range force , the value of @xmath64 is bounded by post - newtonian tests of general relativity to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "however , one can easily see that for mass range of @xmath29 below @xmath72 ev , the relative strength of the @xmath0-induced force drops below @xmath73 from the gravitational field strength , which would make it extremely challenging for experimental detection and immune to the solar system tests .",
    "thus , it is more interesting to consider intermediate - range forces .",
    "tests of gravitational inverse - square law limit the yukawa component of the gravitational potential @xcite . by means of equation ( [ alpha ] ) ,",
    "such tests give a bound on @xmath7 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the two panels are elaborations of plots taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a force with similar values of @xmath29 and @xmath7 ( @xmath74 ) is excluded in the range of masses @xmath75 ev .",
    "the calculations of the ep - violating part of the scalar exchange is a far more delicate excercise .",
    "one should recognize that the equivalence principle is violated already at the level of nucleons , that is @xmath76 . as is well - known",
    ", the neutron and proton mass difference comes about because of the unequal quark masses , and electromagnetic contribution to the nucleon mass .",
    "one can estimate @xmath77 mev and @xmath78 mev , so that together both contributions combine to the observable mass difference @xmath79 mev .",
    "the @xmath26-dependence of both pieces is completely different . because of the loop smallness of @xmath80 the electromagnetic fraction of nucleon mass is far less dependent on @xmath26 : @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , when we estimate the mass of an atom , we add to the universal term proportional to the baryon number a correction proportional the the nucleon mass difference : @xmath82 the first term in ( [ mass ] ) produces the universal coupling @xmath64 calculated in ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the composition - dependent correction reads @xmath83 this may lead to a sizable variation of acceleration @xmath84 between light atoms with @xmath85 and heavy atoms with @xmath86 , @xmath87 other important effect should be related to the dependence of the nuclear binding energy on @xmath26 , that can easily reach a level comparable to ( [ epestimate ] ) .",
    "more detailed considerations of nuclear mass dependence on @xmath26 go outside the scope of the present paper .    as long as we adhere to our naturalness condition @xmath88 , the present bounds on composition dependent ep violations ( @xmath89 )",
    "are easily evaded .",
    "when the earth is the common attractor of the two free - falling bodies , the relevant range @xmath90 km turns into extremely tiny values for the coupling @xmath7 .",
    "still , if we were to consider more fine - tuned scenarios ( @xmath91 ) , it is interesting to note that a fifth force attached to the higgs portal displays a peculiar relation between composition independent and composition dependent effects , as clearly follows from eq .",
    "( [ epestimate ] ) . in principle",
    ", this allows to distinguish between the higgs portal and , _",
    "e.g. _ , the string - inspired scenarios @xcite .",
    "since all couplings to sm particles are suppressed by a factor @xmath92 , the scalar field is sufficiently stable to be a non - thermal relic ( for earlier studies of scalar dark matter see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) . its decay rate into photons is smaller than the current hubble rate as long as the mass is under a kev : @xmath93 however , as emphasized in @xcite , the constraints from the gamma ray background would provide much tighter constraints , and in what follows we will concentrate on the sub - ev range .",
    "the abundance of @xmath26-particles today can be estimated  @xcite in terms of the initial misalignment @xmath94 of the field from its minimum at the time @xmath95 when @xmath96 . at that moment , the field starts oscillating around the minimum of its potential and behaves like non - relativistic matter .",
    "the number of particles in a comoving volume is conserved , so that @xmath97 const , where @xmath98 is the entropy density , @xmath99 is the number density of @xmath26 particles and @xmath100 is the number of effective degrees of freedom in equilibrium with the photons .",
    "the ( average ) energy density of @xmath26 today is thus given by @xmath101 , where @xmath99 and @xmath102 should be taken at @xmath95 .",
    "unsing the relations @xmath103 and @xmath104 together with the hubble rate @xmath105 we express @xmath106 in terms of the parameters of the model to obtain @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the number of degrees of freedom relevant for estimating @xmath6 . since @xmath109 , in the mass range of interest @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "an important constraint on the model comes from the smallest allowed mass for a dark matter particle .",
    "the observations of smallest halos show their size to be comparable to 1 kpc @xcite , which means that the compton wavelength of @xmath26 field would have to be comparable or smaller that this scale .",
    "this in turn imposes the constraint on @xmath94 : @xmath112 notice that at the boundary of the allowed value , @xmath113 ev , the oscillations start around 10 ev , that is just before the matter - radiation equality .    by eq .",
    "( [ nonthermal ] ) it is clear that the abundance of @xmath26-particles depends on the vev of the field at the moment when the hubble parameter becomes of the order of its mass .",
    "this is ultimately a matter of initial conditions .",
    "however , it is interesting to study the preceding evolution of @xmath26 up to electroweak symmetry breaking . during inflation , while the field would classically stay constant , its vacuum expectation value gets random kicks of order @xmath114 every hubble time due to quantum fluctuations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "its behavior can be described formally with a langevin type equation  @xcite @xmath115 in the above @xmath116 is the number of e - folds and @xmath117 is a gaussian random variable .",
    "its @xmath118-averages are @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the expected shift in the field during inflation : @xmath121 as a rough order of magnitude , this gives @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the hubble parameter at the epoch where the scales relevant for the cmb left the horizon .",
    "however , in scenarios with a long epoch of self - regenerating inflation , @xmath124 can be much larger .    at the onset of radiation domination",
    "quantum fluctuations become irrelevant and the field is governed by the classical equation @xmath125 the behavior of @xmath0 up to electro - weak phase transition is obtained by neglecting the second derivative and the mass term from the above equation . while the higgs field is in thermal equilibrium",
    "we have , with good approximation  @xcite , @xmath126 . by using ( [ h ] )",
    "we thus get @xmath127 to a good approximation , the field has a constant velocity , which justifies neglecting the second derivative term in ( [ bai ] ) .",
    "every time a relativistic species leaves the thermal bath , @xmath108 decreases , giving a little  kick \" to the field s velocity .",
    "thus , the details of this mechanism depend on the physics beyond the standard model . by making the minimal assumption",
    "@xmath128 we count only for the sm degrees of freedom and obtain a shift in field space . @xmath129 where the subscript ew indicates quantities at electro - weak phase transition .",
    "finally , at the onset of ew phase transition , the field finds itself displaced from its true minimum by an amount @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is given in eq .",
    "( [ shifts ] ) , @xmath132 a potential disparity between ( [ massbound ] ) and ( [ shift2 ] ) signifies possible fine - tuning problem .",
    "the starting point for the @xmath26 field at the end of inflation would have to be reasonably close to @xmath131 , therefore , if we start , say , with @xmath133 at the end of inflation , the field starts running towards its true minimum , @xmath131 thanks to the coupling to the higgs ( [ radiation ] ) .",
    "however , for masses @xmath134 ev , the shift during radiation domination ( [ radiation ] ) is irrelevant with respect to the scale set by ( [ shift2 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath26 mediates long / intermediate range ( @xmath135 cm ) forces , its initial value @xmath94 has to be fine tuned ( @xmath136 ) , or otherwise @xmath26-particles are overproduced .",
    "any super - cold dark matter , such as axion or @xmath26 field discussed in this paper , are prone to the cmb constraints on the amount of isocurvature perturbations ( for the recent discussions of the axion isocurvature perturbations see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . before going to implications of these constraints for the model",
    ", we would like to comment that the scalar field with the quadratic potential is less susceptible to the isocurvature constraints than axions . in case of the quadratic potential the increase in the homogeneous displacement from the minimum , @xmath94 , over the fluctuating value",
    "@xmath137 leads to the @xmath138 suppression of the isocurvature perturbations , that in principle can be made arbitrarily small by the increase of @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , the increase in the homogenous value of the axion field due to the periodicity of the potential @xmath139 can lead to at most @xmath140 suppression of the isocurvature perturbations .    during inflation",
    ", the field @xmath26 undergoes fluctuations of order @xmath141 as any other light field , @xmath6 being the hubble rate at the time when the fluctuation exits the horizon .",
    "the produced perturbation are of isocurvature type . following the standard treatment that also applies to axions  @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the power spectrum of entropy perturbations @xmath142 and compare it to that of curvature perturbations @xmath143 .",
    "the ratio of the two defines a parameter @xmath144 where @xmath145 is proportional to the total energy density in dark matter , @xmath146 is the usual inflationary slow - roll parameter and @xmath147 the speed of sound of the adiabatic fluctuations during inflation  @xcite .    by using ( [ nonthermal ] ) and",
    "@xmath148 we get , for small @xmath149 , @xmath150 the above result can nicely be re - expressed in terms of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath151 . at the pivot wavenumber",
    "@xmath152 the limit set by wmap+bao+sn is @xmath153  @xcite .",
    "this gives the rather strict constraint @xmath154 which is very similar to the conclusions reached for the axion cosmology @xcite .",
    "if we insist on @xmath155 making most of the cold dark matter density , this result shows that the detectable level of inflationary gravitational waves ( @xmath156 ) implies a very light scalar , close to the bound ( [ massbound ] ) , which would make @xmath26-mediated fifth force totally negligible .",
    "conversely , a detectable level of the fifth force ( @xmath157 ev ) would imply tiny @xmath62 on the order of @xmath158 favoring some intermediate scale inflationary scenarios , @xmath159 gev . given that in some models of inflation ( see _",
    "@xcite ) the hubble parameter can be as low as @xmath160 , producing a tensor to scalar ratio @xmath161 , constructing an inflationary model with the hubble parameter at some intermediate scale does not pause any model - building challenge .",
    "the model we considered in this work is very similar to the linearized version of the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory when the scalar field is supplied with the mass term .",
    "indeed , the transformation from the jordan to the einstein frame puts the bd scalar in front of any dimensionful parameter .",
    "therefore , the @xmath7 parameter from the model considered here can be identified with @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the bd parameter .",
    "it is very important to keep in mind , however , one crucial difference . in the bd theory",
    ", the @xmath0-field also couples to all massive states that may exist beyond the sm states , and therefore , even at the electroweak scale one should expect the extension of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) by additional higher - dimensional operators .",
    "such terms alter the couplings of bd scalar to matter , and make couplings to gauge bosons , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath164 , different from the values in the model considered here .",
    "moreover , the bd theory requires explicit uv completion , while the model with coupling via the super - renormalizable portal assumes that higher - dimensional operators are absent from the beginning and generated only via the sm loops with the @xmath26-independent uv cutoff .",
    "the key feature of the model considered here is its technical naturalness .",
    "it allows to have a relatively light scalar dark matter that generate medium - range attractive force without extra fine tuning of the parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "a detectable level of the fifth force , would have to be combined with inflationary scenarios with low @xmath62 and face with the potential fine - tuning problem in initial condition of the scalar field value .",
    "one of the most interesting ( albeit fine - tuned ) scenarios that can have particle physics implications not considered in this paper is the @xmath0-dependence of the electroweak phase transition . if @xmath29 is taken comparable to the hubble rate at @xmath165 gev , @xmath166 can lead to @xmath167 gev@xmath168 , thus altering the properties of the electorweak sector close to the phase tansition point .",
    "this way , one could change the order of the phase transition , and make it first order if the effective higgs mass is pushed below 50 gev .",
    "the model considered here falls into the class of the `` super - cool '' dark matter models , such as axion dark matter .",
    "another example , worth of investigation is the vector dark matter . there , the coupling of vector fields to the sm and the mass of the vector fields do not have to follow the strength@xmath169range = const constraint of the scalar case .",
    "this could open more room for the fifth - force mediated by the vector - like sub - ev dark matter .",
