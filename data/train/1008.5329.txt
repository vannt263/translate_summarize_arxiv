    "we see that the frame - free configurations of @xmath125 of cardinality @xmath4 correspond bijectively to the non - zero terms in the expansion @xmath207 of the determinant of @xmath17 ( since @xmath17 has zeros along its leading diagonal ) .    given a frame - free configuration @xmath186 of @xmath125 of cardinality @xmath4 ,",
    "define its _ sign _ @xmath208 to be @xmath209 where the product is over the oriented cycles in the representation of @xmath186 as a collection of oriented edges between vertices of @xmath12 , and @xmath210 is equal to the number of vertices in @xmath211 for a cycle @xmath211 .",
    "it is easy to see that this is equal to the sign of the corresponding permutation .",
    "set @xmath212 to be the product of the entries of @xmath17 corresponding to the elements of @xmath186 .",
