    "<S> * recent rhic data on hadron ( @xmath2 ) production at large transverse momentum @xmath3 in central @xmath4 collisions show a clear suppression of the rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the usual explanation is that the phenomenon is due to jet quenching , which thus makes a probe of gluon plasma @xcite . in the present work we propose an explanation of the same data as due to the color glass condensate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our account of the data provides also a way to distinguish between the two explanations .    at very high energies </S>",
    "<S> the number of partons ( mainly gluons ) in a nucleus grows very rapidly and eventually leads to saturation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will attempt to express this saturation in the simplest way , by invoking expressions used at small @xmath5 .    0.5 cm * 2 . * with @xmath6 the gluon distribution , at small @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) </S>",
    "<S> a simple evolution equation is @xcite : @xmath8 here @xmath9 amounts to a free parameter , but will be taken as the radius of the quarks ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate integration of the last term leads to the modified gluon distribution @xmath11 where @xmath12    0.5 cm * 3 . </S>",
    "<S> * the basic formula for @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a @xmath15-factor , here for simplicity taken k=2 , @xmath16 and for @xmath17 : @xmath18 and @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath20 where e.g. @xmath21 etc .    0.5 cm * 4 . * for @xmath22 one has @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the glauber thikness function ( @xmath25 , @xmath26density of nucleus @xmath27 ) normalized as @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we use a gaussian @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive @xmath31 is augmented by an intrinsic transverse momentum of a gaussian with @xmath32 . for the parton distributions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 we use the set cteq 5 , leading order @xcite and for the fragmentation functions we use the binnewies et al . </S>",
    "<S> , again leading order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use @xmath34 in eqs ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .    0.5 cm * 5 . * our results at 130 a @xmath35 for @xmath36 production at @xmath37 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( solid line ) . the dashed line shows the results without the effects of the color glass condensate . on the same figure we plot the results for jet quenching corresponding to opacity @xmath38 @xcite ( dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> both the solid and the dotted line account well for the data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , at large @xmath3 ( @xmath39 ) the effect of the color glass condensate tends to disappear and the solid line approaches the dashed line ; this is due to the factor @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , which appears in the modified gluon distribution . on the other hand , jet quenching remains below , and this gives the possibility to distinguish between the two mechanisms .    at very low @xmath3 ( @xmath42 ) </S>",

    "<S> perturbative qcd is inapplicable and various effects , like recoil resummation , play a dominant role </S>",
