    "the experimental accuracy reached by the electroweak precision observables in particle accelerators allows to test the standard model ( sm ) at the quantum level within an accuracy better than one per mil .",
    "although precision observables at lep have played an important role in this respect , a new generation of experiments at the tevatron ( ii ) , lhc and a future linear collider ( lc ) will be necessary to find out the ultimate nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "when extending the higgs sector , we mainly focus on two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) , and most particularly on the type ii ones like that of the the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite . the fact that the higgs bosons of the mssm ( and their susy counterparts ) couple most preferentially to heavy quarks suggests that the physics of the top and bottom quarks is the natural arena where to try to get a hint of the existence of susy higgs particles . in this paper",
    "we report on the production of a heavy charged higgs boson in association with the top and bottom quarks at the tevatron and lhc energies within the mssm .",
    "the mass of the charged higgs is assumed @xmath3 , and so it can not come from the decay of a top quark . while the detection of a charged higgs boson would still leave a lot of questions unanswered , it would immediately offer ( in contrast to the detection of a neutral one ) indisputable evidence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the basic production processes under consideration are @xmath4 there are many other processes for charged higgs production , which have been studied in the literature@xcite , such as : i ) one - loop gluon fusion ( @xmath5 ) ; ii ) tree - level pair production in bottom quark scattering ( @xmath6 ) , iii ) associated production with @xmath7 : @xmath8 ( tree - level ) , @xmath9 ( one - loop ) , iv ) drell - yan type production ( @xmath10 ) . however , in all these cases the production cross - section is smaller than for ( [ tbh ] ) if we restrict ourselves to high values of @xmath1 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "although process ( [ tbh ] ) has been studied previously@xcite , the inclusion of the leading quantum susy effects was missing and turns out to be very important , as first hinted in@xcite and further elaborated in@xcite .",
    "at the parton level , the reaction ( [ tbh ] ) proceeds through three channels : i ) @xmath12-annihilation for light quarks @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( the @xmath15 contribution can be safely neglected ) , a channel only relevant for the tevatron ; ii ) @xmath16-fusion @xmath17 which is dominant at the lhc , but it can also be important at the tevatron for increasing @xmath18 masses ; and finally there is the iii ) bottom - gluon 2-body channel @xmath19 we will compute the cross - section for the charged higgs boson production process ( [ tbh ] ) at the leading order ( lo ) in qcd , namely at @xmath20 . however , the qcd corrections at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) or @xmath21 could be important .",
    "although a dedicated calculation of these higher order effects for the process under consideration is not available , let us mention that the corresponding calculation for the related process in the standard model , @xmath22 , is available and shows that the nlo effects lead to a non - trivial qcd @xmath23-factor which is typically smaller than one at the tevatron , and up to @xmath24 at the lhc@xcite . on the other hand , partial calculations of the qcd corrections to the process ( [ tbh ] ) at the nlo have appeared .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the standard nlo qcd corrections to the subprocess  ( [ gb - th ] ) at the lhc are computed , obtaining a large k - factor between @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "taking into account these considerations , a large @xmath23-factor for the full process ( [ tbh ] ) coming from the standard qcd corrections ( e.g. @xmath28 ) is not ruled out .",
    "however , in the absence of a complete calculation of these qcd effects , in what follows we present our results at the leading order and will parametrize our ignorance of the complete nlo effects in terms of a @xmath23-factor , which will be assumed different from one only for the tevatron , where the size of the cross - section is hardly the necessary for a viable study . on the other hand , for the lhc the cross - section ,",
    "being typically three orders of magnitude larger , can afford a qcd @xmath23-factor of one .",
    "once a pdf for @xmath29-quarks is used , there is some amount of overlap between @xmath30- and @xmath16-initiated amplitudes , which has to be removed  @xcite .",
    "the overlap arises because the @xmath29-density in the @xmath30 amplitude receives contributions from gluon splitting which was already counted in the @xmath16 amplitude , so we have to avoid double counting by the subtracting of the gluon splitting term .",
    "the net partonic cross - section from the @xmath30- and @xmath16-initiated subprocesses is @xmath31 furthermore , for the study of the various differential distributions one has to properly combine the @xmath32 and @xmath33 processes mentioned above in order to reproduce not only the total cross - section but also the _ correct event kinematics .",
    "_ the point is that we know the _",
    "total amount _ of double counting but not a priori which part of this value should be subtracted from the @xmath34 process and which part from the @xmath35 one .",
    "we apply here the method proposed in  @xcite for the analogous process of the single top quark production . according to this method we use the cut on the transverse momenta of the @xmath29-quark associated with charged higgs boson production to separate and recombine @xmath16- and @xmath30-initiated processes .",
    "concerning the signature , we consider the dominant @xmath36 final state for the combined signal process  ( [ tbh ] ) .",
    "we focus here on the triple @xmath29-tagging case and consider the situation where one top decays hadronically and the other leptonically ( including _ only _ electron and muon decay channels ) in order to reduce the combinatorics when both top quarks are reconstructed . the branching ratio of @xmath37 is @xmath38 .    in order to decide whether a charged higgs boson cross - section leads to a detectable signal , we have to compute the background rate .",
    "the main qcd backgrounds leading to the same @xmath39 signature and their respective cross - sections are shown in table [ bkg ] .",
    ".the main background processes to the signal ( [ tbh ] ) at the tevatron ( 2nd column ) and the lhc ( 3rd column ) under cuts explained in the text . the corresponding subtraction term is also shown .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      in figs .",
    "[ fig : discovery]a , b we find the regions of the @xmath40 plane in which the tevatron and the lhc can find ( or exclude ) the existence of the charged higgs boson .",
    "the curves correspond to the various sets of mssm parameters indicated in table [ tab : susypar ] . for the tevatron we have included a qcd @xmath23-factor of @xmath41 , whereas for the lhc we have just set @xmath42 . from these figures",
    "it is obvious that the presence of the susy corrections alters significantly the higgs boson discovery potential of the hadron colliders .",
    "it is also patent the tevatron could have a chance to find a charged higgs boson in the intermediate range @xmath43 .",
    "let us now sketch how the various quantum corrections have been computed . among the plethora of possible corrections we disregarded virtual supersymmetric effects on the @xmath44 and @xmath45 vertices and on the gluon propagators .",
    "we expect those to be of order @xmath46 and thus suppressed by a non - enhanced ( i.e. @xmath47-independent ) mssm form factor coming from the loop integrals . therefore , we can neglect these contributions as we are only considering effects of the form @xmath48 at large @xmath47 . the cross - section for",
    "the signal increases steeply with @xmath47  and becomes highly significant for @xmath47@xmath49 , while it is much smaller for @xmath47  in the low interval @xmath50 where the remaining susy corrections are of the same order or even dominant , so our approximation is well justified .",
    "similarly , we neglect all those electroweak corrections in vertices and self - energies which are proportional to pure @xmath51 gauge couplings ; in particular , vertices involving electroweak gauge bosons and those involving electroweak gauginos .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that vertices involving higgs bosons exchange yield a very tiny overall contribution , due to automatic cancellations arranged by the underlying supersymmetry .",
    "finally , there are the strong gluino - squark diagrams and the @xmath52-enhanced higgsino - squark vertices implicit in chargino - neutralino loops .",
    "we have extracted the parts of these interactions which are ( by far ) the more relevant ones at high @xmath52 and confirmed that the remaining contributions are negligible . in practice",
    "this means that we may concentrate our analysis on the interval @xmath53 where we can be sure that our approximation does include the bulk of the mssm corrections while at the same time the cross - section of process ( [ tbh ] ) starts to be sufficiently large to consider it as an efficient mechanism for charged higgs boson production .",
    "the leading contributions are similar to those found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the decay process @xmath54 , where we also refer for detailed renormalization issues .",
    "recently these dominant effects have been conveniently described through an effective lagrangian approach that contains effective couplings absorbing both the leading susy contributions and the known part of the qcd corrections  @xcite . at high @xmath52",
    "the most relevant piece is the effective @xmath55-coupling as it carries the leading part of the ( appropriately resummed ) quantum effects : @xmath56 the quantity @xmath57 above see ( @xcite) contains the bulk of the supersymmetric contributions . although the leading corrections have been identified , we have computed the full set of one - loop susy diagrams for the relevant @xmath55 vertex , which involve similar bunch of diagrams as in the on - shell case@xcite , but here we have got to account for the off - shell external lines , which is a non - trivial task .",
    "the result is that these off - shell corrections amount to a few percent contribution that we have included in our numerical analysis .",
    "coming back to figs .",
    "[ fig : discovery ] and table [ tab : susypar ] , let us remark that parameter set b constitutes a typical case for moderately positive corrections .",
    "on the other hand set a is over - optimized , and sets c and d give more and more negative corrections . in all cases these corrections decouple very slowly with the gluino mass , for fixed values of the other masses .",
    "furthermore , they exhibit a non - decoupling behavior when _ all _ susy parameters are scaled up by a common factor@xcite .",
    "this susy non - decoupling behavior@xcite is associated to the properties of the quantity @xmath57 entering eq.([effeclag ] ) .",
    "the violation of the decoupling theorem@xcite is caused by the dimensionful higgs - quark - squark coupling , which increases arbitrarily with the susy scale . through this coupling the mssm higgs doublet that interacts only with the top quark at the tree - level ,",
    "effectively couples to the bottom quark at one - loop .",
    "therefore , that interaction can not be re - absorbed in the parameters of the low - energy higgs sector after integrating out the sparticle masses .",
    "this welcome feature is at the basis of the large radiative corrections found in our study of the charged higgs production process ( [ tbh ] ) , and it could be responsible for the eventual finding of this scalar boson .",
    "these facts were amply exploited in ref.@xcite where the suggestion of the present calculation was first made and the importance of its correlation with the neutral higgs production processes @xmath58 was first emphasized .",
    "such effects and correlations could eventually lead to the discovery of susy .",
