    "since the discovery of dwarfs of spectral type later than m as companions to nearby stars ( becklin & zuckerman 1988 ; nakajima et al . 1995 ) major observational and theoretical progress has been made , thanks to sensitive new wide - area surveys at optical ( 0.41.0  @xmath12 m ) and infrared ( 1.02.5  @xmath12 m ) wavelengths and models of atmospheres of dwarfs with effective temperatures between those of the coolest stars and the giant planets ( see the reviews by chabrier & baraffe 2000 ; burrows et al . 2001 ) .",
    "two new spectral classes have been identified later than type m : the l dwarfs , characterized by the disappearance of gas - phase tio and vo , and the t dwarfs , characterized by methane band absorption in the @xmath13 and @xmath5 spectral regions ( martn et al .",

    "most l dwarfs and all t dwarfs are brown dwarfs .",
    "these objects are of interest because they occupy the mass range between that of stars and giant planets ; because many of them are likely to have the intrinsic properties of giant planets , which at present can not be directly observed ; and because they allow the investigation of the initial mass function to substellar masses .",
    "field l and t dwarfs have been discovered in large numbers in recent sky surveys : the deep near infrared survey ( denis , epchtein 1997 ) ; the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ; beichman et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the optical sloan digital sky survey sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "including objects described in the present paper , there are now about 280 l dwarfs and 58 t dwarf systems published ( e.g. delfosse et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2002a , 2003e ; g02 ) .",
    "this large sample has been used to establish a complete spectral sequence from l0 to t9 ( g02 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2002a ; mclean et al . 2003",
    "; present paper ) .    unlike stars , brown dwarfs",
    "lack a sustained source of thermonuclear energy , and hence cool continuously , passing through the l and t stages , with their initial spectral types depending on their masses .",
    "their observational properties are thus a function not only of mass and metallicity , but also of age .",
    "not all dwarfs of a given spectral type or effective temperature are identical ; they have different gravities and different colors , the latter likely due to differing amounts of particulate matter in the atmosphere .",
    "for example , in mid to late l dwarfs there is a large scatter in the @xmath0 colors and apparently no one - to - one correspondence between effective temperature and spectral type ( leggett et al . 2002a ; golimowski et al . 2004 ) .",
    "such considerations drive searches for and measurements of additional dwarfs , in order to more fully characterize their atmospheres .",
    "2mass and sdss have been highly complementary in the discovery of l and t dwarfs .",
    "most of the flux from late - type dwarfs is emitted longward of 1 @xmath12 m , and the @xmath14 and @xmath4 colors of m and l dwarfs become redder with decreasing effective temperature , allowing the identification by 2mass of large numbers of l dwarfs ( kirkpatrick et al . 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "however , in the transition from l to t , @xmath15 absorption appears in the @xmath13 and @xmath5 regions ( and @xmath16 absorption predominantly at @xmath5 ) , strengthening with later spectral type and causing the t dwarfs to become increasingly blue in their @xmath0 colors .",
    "the @xmath0 colors of early t dwarfs are similar to those of the common k and m stars , making their identification in 2mass very difficult .",
    "however in the sdss filters the dwarfs simply become redder and thus the early t dwarfs have been found primarily in sdss imaging ( leggett et al . 2000 ) .",
    "only three objects with spectral types between t0 and t3.5 have been identified from sources other than the sdss ",

    "2003 ) . to date , all t dwarfs later than t7 have been found in the 2mass database ( burgasser et al .",
    "2002a ) but we expect such objects to be found in the sdss imaging data as sky coverage is increased .    in this paper",
    "we present near - infrared photometry and spectra of new and previously reported l and t dwarfs ( including 14 new t dwarfs ) and compare the colors and spectra with predictions from state of the art model atmospheres with and without clouds .",
    "the new objects observed are described in the next section , and the new @xmath0 photometric and spectroscopic observations are described in  3 , where we also derive spectral types .",
    " 4 presents colors , spectral types and absolute magnitudes for the entire body of near - infrared data on l and t dwarfs which we have accumulated to date . in  5 , we compare these data to model atmospheres .",
    "the conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "the general goals of our observational efforts are to identify samples of late l and t dwarfs which are at least representative and ideally complete , and to measure their spectral and photometric characteristics . to this end , we have observed new candidate very cool dwarfs selected from the photometric observations of the sdss . we have also re - observed some previously published sdss l and t dwarfs for which our observations are incomplete or suspect , and have added some 2mass dwarfs where they complement our sample .",

    "table 1 lists the names and sdss @xmath20 photometry of 51 confirmed sdss dwarfs , most of them previously unpublished .",
    "a small number of these dwarfs are also detected in the sdss @xmath21 band , and these magnitudes are presented later in the paper . as noted in table 1 ,",
    "a few of these objects are described by hawley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who present optical spectral types of a large sample of m , l and t dwarfs observed by sdss .",
    "one object , 2mass j090837.97@xmath1503208.0 , was identified as an l dwarf by cruz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from the 2mass database while this paper was in preparation .",
    "finding charts from the sdss @xmath22-band imaging are presented in figure 1 for all 51 objects in table 1 as charts have not been previously published for any of the objects .    following the iau convention ,",
    "the sdss names are based on the j2000 coordinates at the epoch of the initial observation and will be abbreviated in the text when individual objects are discussed ; thus sdss j003259.36@xmath1141036.6 will be called by the shortened name sdss j0032@xmath11410 .",
    "a similar convention is used for 2mass objects , whose full coordinate names are given later ( in table 9 ) . note that these faint stars and brown dwarfs are nearby and likely to have significant proper motions , so the names do not necessarily provide accurate coordinates for later epochs .",
    "a future paper will discuss the measured sdss positions and proper motions , since many of the objects were measured at more than one epoch .",
    "the sdss @xmath23 and @xmath22 magnitudes are @xmath24 magnitudes , for which the zeropoint in all bands is 3631 jy ( oke & gunn 1983 ; fukugita et al . 1996 ) . the @xmath25 magnitudes used at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) and discussed in this paper are on the @xmath26(vega)@xmath27 0.0 system .",
    "the sdss magnitudes are modified to be asinh magnitudes , identical to logarithmic magnitudes for high signal - to - noise ratio measurements ( @xmath28 ) and linear with flux below this ( lupton , gunn & szalay 1999 ) . for the observations discussed herein , zero flux density corresponds to @xmath29 25.1 , @xmath30 24.4 and @xmath31 22.8 .",
    "the sdss camera ( gunn et al . 1998 ) scans the sky and produces near - simultaneous ccd images in five filters covering the optical bands @xmath32 and @xmath22 ( centered at 3551  , 4686  , 6166  , 7480  and 8932  . ) the imaging data are reduced through a set of automated software pipelines .",
    "the photometric pipeline photo ( lupton et al . 2002 ) corrects the data , finds and measures objects , and applies photometric and astrometric calibrations .",
    "the photometric calibration is provided via a network of standard stars ( hogg et al .",
    "2001 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the astrometric calibration via matches to standard astrometric catalogues ( pier et al .",
    "the photometry is accurate to about 2% in @xmath33 and @xmath23 and to about 3% in @xmath34 and @xmath22 for objects brighter than about 20 and 19 respectively , while the astrometric accuracy is better than @xmath35 ( r.m.s . ) in each coordinate .",
    "the result is a catalogue of objects with magnitudes in five bands , positions , and shape parameters ( e.g. abazajian et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "all l and t dwarfs are undetected in sdss @xmath34 and @xmath10 , and all save the brightest are undetected in @xmath21 .",
    "almost all late l and t dwarfs have @xmath36 2 ; thus candidate field brown dwarfs are selected from the sdss photometry to be very red . given the extremely red colors and low luminosities of these dwarfs ,",
    "they are often detected only in the @xmath22 band .",
    "objects this red are rare ; at the sdss magnitude limits they are late l and t dwarfs , quasars at redshift greater than 5.7 ( fan et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) or very rare unusual broad absorption line quasars ( see hall et al .",
    "2002 ) , and their surface density is smaller than about one per 50 square degrees . as a result , @xmath22-band only detections are overwhelmed by data artifacts , in particular `` cosmic rays '' in the @xmath22 detectors .",
    "the winnowing of `` objects '' to find those that are real is an exhaustive process , consisting of careful analysis of the image to reject cosmic rays ( which usually have imprints smaller than the point spread function ) , re - observation with another telescope at @xmath22 band ( usually the arc 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ) , and comparison with @xmath7-band observations from 2mass or elsewhere .",
    "@xmath7-band photometry also allows a first judgment as to whether an object is a brown dwarf or a high redshift quasar .",
    "these procedures are described in detail by fan et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "the total area searched to date for candidate very red dwarfs in sdss , including objects in our previous papers and in table 1 , is 2870 square degrees , so the surface density of t dwarfs found by sdss is approximately 1 per 100 square degrees .",
    "the regions of the sky searched are shown by fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "some of the objects in the final sample presented in  4 have been found to be close binaries , usually from @xmath37 imaging .",
    "such objects will be designated by `` ab '' attached to the names , since the photometric and spectroscopic observations measure the total flux of both members .",
    "these known binaries are denis - p  j0205@xmath21159ab ( koerner et al .",

    "a log of the measured spectra is given in table 5 .",

    "as effective temperatures of dwarfs cool to those of the late m dwarfs and below , two chemical changes occur in their photospheres that strongly impact their emergent spectral energy distributions . the first to occur , for late m dwarfs ,",
    "is the appearance of corundum ( @xmath59 grains within the photosphere ( jones & tsuji 1997 ) and the formation of condensate clouds . at the even lower effective temperatures of the l dwarfs iron and silicate",
    "are the most important condensates .",
    "the effect of the clouds is to weaken or veil the molecular absorption bands and to redden the @xmath0 colors of l dwarfs ( see e.g. ackerman & marley 2001 , allard et al .",
    "2001 , marley et al .",
    "2002 , tsuji & nakajima 2003 ) .",
    "the extent of these effects depends upon the number , size , and vertical distribution of the condensates ; for spectral modeling these parameters must either be computed from a model or somehow specified .",
    "ackerman & marley ( 2001 ) developed a one - dimensional model of mixing and sedimentation for this purpose . in their model upward vertical mixing of gas and condensate replaces condensates that fall through the cloud base , while far above the cloud base sedimentation efficiently cleanses the atmosphere of condensates .",
    "tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) model the cloud by specifying the temperature range within which the condensates are found .",
    "they describe their limits to be the points at which the atmosphere is cool enough for condensation but hot enough that the condensates are small enough to remain suspended in the atmosphere and are less prone to sedimentation .",
    "the temperature domain in which the cloud is formed depends on the details of the model used , but is around @xmath1115001700  k ( ackerman & marley 2001 ) or @xmath1118002000  k ( tsuji & nakajima 2003 ) . in the t dwarfs the cloud layer lies near the base or below the wavelength - dependent photosphere and plays a smaller role in determining the observed flux distribution .    the second and later chemical change that occurs in these high - pressure , low - temperature atmospheres is the formation of additional molecular species in the photosphere , most importantly ch@xmath42 .",
    "co and h@xmath3o are abundant in m dwarf atmospheres , but by mid - l the abundance of ch@xmath42 becomes significant at the expense of co ( noll et al .",

    "the increasing ch@xmath42 absorption largely accounts for the increasingly blue @xmath0 colors of the t dwarfs with later spectral type , more than compensating for the reddening due to the decreasing effective temperature . for dwarfs of type t5 and",
    "later , pressure - induced h@xmath3 becomes a significant opacity source .",
    "this opacity depresses the flux in the @xmath5 band , and to a lesser extent the @xmath13 band , and also contributes to the blue near - infrared colors . for a useful summary of the important molecular species and the wavelength ranges in which they are observed",
    "see figure 15 of burrows et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "spectral classification schemes for l and t dwarfs have been developed using both the red and the near - infrared spectral regions . in the late 1990s",
    "kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and martn et al .",
    "( 1999b ) developed schemes using the strengths of various absorption features and pseudo - continuum slopes seen in optical spectra to classify the l dwarfs .",
    "a few years later , burgasser et al . ( 2002a ) and g02 presented schemes using the strengths of the near - infrared molecular absorption bands to classify the t dwarfs , and in the case of g02 , l dwarfs also . while the burgasser et al . ( 2002a ) and g02 schemes for t dwarfs give results in very close agreement , the g02 scheme for l dwarfs can give results that differ by as much as 2.5 subclasses from those given by the kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) scheme , suggesting that there are significant differences in the optical and infrared classification of l dwarfs .",
    "dwarfs in our sample whose optical and infrared spectral classes differ by more than one subclass are identified in table 9 .",
    "some of the scatter is due to the small differences in the infrared indices from one subtype to the next , combined with measurement errors .",
    "however , the differences in optical and infrared spectral types are not entirely random . where there are differences , g02 generally assign earlier spectral types to those objects that are redder than average in @xmath57 , and later types to those which are bluer ( stephens 2001 , figure 7.5 ) .    models of l and t dwarf atmospheres give some insight into the variations seen among the spectral indices .",
    "generally speaking , the spectra of l and t dwarfs are less sensitive to the effects of cloud decks in the 0.71.0  @xmath12 m spectral region than at wavelengths longer than 1@xmath12 m .",
    "this is because , for effective temperatures corresponding to the earliest l types , optical depth unity in the far - red is reached below the cloud deck , but as the cloud is still fairly optically thin it does not substantially influence the red spectrum . at lower effective temperatures , the clouds place a `` floor '' on the region from which the emergent flux arises , but because of the large opacity in the far - red due to initially refractory diatomics and water and later to k  i and na  i resonance line absorption , most of the outgoing red flux arises from above the cloud decks .",
    "thus for dwarfs with effective temperature cooler than about 1800  k ( types @xmath11l3 and later , leggett et al .",
    "2002a , b ; golimowski et al . 2004 ) slight changes in the cloud deck optical depth have little effect on the emergent red spectrum .    in the near - infrared ( particularly the @xmath38 and the @xmath7 bands )",
    ", the windows between the molecular bands of water and other opacity sources allow flux to emerge from very deep in the atmosphere . in these regions",
    "the opacity floor imposed by the clouds substantially alters the depth to which one can see into the atmosphere ( see figure 7 of ackerman & marley 2001 and figure 4 of marley et al .",
    "thus for dwarfs with @xmath60 in the range from about 1800 to 1500  k ( roughly l3 to l7 ) , slight changes in the cloud profile substantially alter the near - infrared spectrum .",
    "this proposed atmospheric structure implies that spectral typing schemes for mid to late l dwarfs that rely on far - red spectra ( e.g. kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 ) tend to be less sensitive to the vertical distribution of condensates in the atmosphere than schemes that rely upon near - infrared spectra or spectral indices ( g02 ) .",
    "stephens ( 2001 , 2003 ) considered the boundaries of the regions employed in the g02 spectral typing system and found that the flux in the g02 bandpasses usually originates from within the cloud decks . for the earliest l dwarfs",
    ", cloud opacity is not significant , but for the mid l dwarfs , the g02 1.5 @xmath12 m water index can be a more sensitive indicator of _ cloud optical depth _ than of _ effective temperature_. at the same time , the 2.2 @xmath12 m methane index is more sensitive to @xmath60 than to cloud properties , since this spectral region is more opaque and optical depth unity is reached higher in the atmosphere .",
    "however , the classification system of g02 relies heavily on the 1.5 @xmath12 m index , as it is the only infrared index that covers the entire l spectral type range .",
    "this index undergoes a much larger change through the l sequence than does the other useful infrared index , ch@xmath42k .",
    "note that g02 do not claim that defining the spectral type is equivalent to measuring the effective temperature ; they use a simple classification scheme based on spectral appearance in which the effects of gravity and clouds are not separated from those of temperature .",
    "this larger sample of dwarfs also suggests some inconsistency in the infrared classification of late l dwarfs . while the g02 scheme provides excellent internal consistency for t dwarfs , the h@xmath3o 1.5 @xmath12 m index tends to give a later spectral type than does the ch@xmath42 2.2 @xmath12 m index for dwarfs in the range l5l9.5 .",
    "this tendency was not apparent in the smaller g02 sample ; the results for the present larger sample suggest that an adjustment of the flux ratio definitions as a function of spectral type for h@xmath3o 1.5 @xmath12 m and ch@xmath42 2.2 @xmath12 m in the l5l9.5 range could give better internal consistency .",
    "figure 3 plots , for the final sample presented in table 9 , various colors against spectral type ( determined by the g02 scheme apart from four l dwarfs classified optically , see table 9 ) ; typical error bars are shown . only those dwarfs with types determined from their spectra are shown .",
    "clouds strongly affect both colors and spectral types of mid l dwarfs classified from the near - infrared indices , as discussed in  5.1 and  5.2 .",
    "this effect can be seen in figure 3 , where the spread in the @xmath38 through @xmath5 colors is greatest from l3 to l7.5 , just when the clouds in the detectable atmosphere are expected to be most optically thick .",
    "the overall conclusion is that color can not be used as an ( infrared ) spectral type indicator for l dwarfs . for t dwarfs , @xmath55 and @xmath14",
    "appear to be reasonable indicators of type . given improved sensitivity",
    ", @xmath51 may also be a useful t - type indicator .",
    "note , however , that @xmath51 is expected to turn blueward at @xmath61  600  k as the na , k , and other alkalis condense into solids and the opacity of the na and k lines falls ( burrows et al . 2002 ; marley et al .",
    "the late t dwarfs show significant scatter in their @xmath4 and @xmath57 colors .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the onset of pressure - induced h@xmath3 absorption , which is very gravity sensitive ( borysow , jorgensen & zheng , 1997 ) . as described in  5.6",
    ", we can interpret the observed spread in @xmath4 as a range in surface gravity for the field t dwarf population .",
    "the @xmath56 colors of the mid t dwarfs also show considerable scatter ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this is an intriguing result , because the @xmath38 and @xmath7 bands are the most transparent windows into these atmospheres , with the @xmath38 band being the clearer of the two . as such",
    ", these bands are particularly sensitive to any deep variations in opacity between atmospheres , such as might be related to the upper reaches of any remaining deep silicate cloud ( see figure 7 of ackerman & marley 2001 ) .",
    "the variation may thus be due to differences in the process(es ) responsible for the removal of condensates at the l to t transition .",
    "since the @xmath38 band is sensitive to the far wings of the optical na - d and k i resonance lines ( burrows & volobuyev 2003 ) these variations might arise from differences in the removal of gaseous na and k , due to gravity or metallicity effects .",
    "more detailed modeling of the l to t dwarf transition and the removal of atmospheric condensates is required to account for these observations .      in the remainder of this paper",
    "we compare observed colors with two varieties of models from marley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in the first type of model , condensate opacity is ignored , although condensation chemistry is accounted for in chemical equilibrium and molecular opacities .",

    "known binaries were removed from the sample before fitting the data ; the mean scatter around the fit is 0.4 magnitudes for m@xmath92 and 0.3 magnitudes for m@xmath93 .    as noted by burgasser et al .",
    "( 2002b ) these data suggest that the l to t dwarf transition may be more complex than implied by the picture of a continuously sinking cloud .",
    "the most notable discrepancy between the simple picture and the data shown in these figures is the brightening seen at @xmath7-band as the objects transition from l to t. in this section we summarize various suggested mechanisms to explain this behavior and compare their predictions to the photometric data presented here .",
    "a finite - thickness cloud deck forming progressively lower in the atmosphere will eventually disappear from sight . in the opposite extreme , dust that is well mixed through the entire observable atmosphere , as in the dusty models of the lyon group ( e.g. allard et al .",
    "2001 ) , will by definition never disappear .",
    "models of such objects show that they simply become progressively redder as they cool and thus , due to veiling of the changing molecular bands , never exhibit an l to t transition .",
    "although models with finite - thickness cloud decks do move from red , l - like colors to blue , t - like colors , they tend to do so relatively slowly .",
    "this is because the cloud always has a finite thickness and thus does not disappear from a given bandpass instantaneously . during the time the cloud is departing ,",
    "say from @xmath7-band visibility , the overall atmosphere is continuing to cool and become fainter .",
    "thus in a color magnitude diagram ( figures 8 and 9 ) models with finite - thickness clouds that are opaque enough to reach the colors of the latest l dwarfs ( @xmath94 ) tend to leisurely turn to the blue as they cool and so reach the colors of the early t dwarfs at too faint magnitudes . the @xmath95 model in figure 8",
    "is an example .",
    "tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) proposed an interesting solution to this problem .",
    "they found a family of models with relatively thin cloud decks in which the turnoff from red to blue in @xmath57 was a function of gravity . in these models",
    "low - gravity 10 @xmath9 objects depart from what might be called the `` l - type cooling sequence '' ( the progressive reddening in @xmath57 with later spectral type ) and turn from red to blue at a point almost 2 magnitudes brighter than high - gravity 70 @xmath9 objects . a similar ,",
    "though less extreme , bright turn off is seen in the @xmath96 family of models in our figures 8 and 9 .",
    "tsuji & nakajima then suggest that there is not a single evolutionary path in which objects first fade at @xmath7 band as they get redder and then brighten as they turn blue .",
    "rather they propose that the brighter transition t dwarfs are low mass objects that cooled to mid - l type and then turned from red to blue colors around @xmath97 .",
    "dimmer transition objects would represent intermediate - mass brown dwarfs that turned off the l cooling sequence at a later l type and redder @xmath57 , and and the latest ls would represent the highest mass objects .",
    "this model makes a number of interesting predictions .",
    "first , the @xmath50 vs. @xmath57 phase space between the l and t dwarfs should eventually be found to be fairly evenly populated both at brighter and fainter magnitudes than is shown by the transition objects detected to date .",
    "second , bright early t dwarfs , like sdss j1021@xmath20304 ( t3 ) or 2mass j0559@xmath21404 ( t4.5 ) should be fairly low mass objects while the latest and reddest l dwarfs , like 2mass j1632@xmath11904 ( l7.5 ) , should be fairly high mass objects .",
    "emerging gravity indicators should be able to test this hypothesis .",
    "plotted in the right panels of figures 8 and 9 are model sequences from marley et al .",
    "both cloud - free and cloudy models are shown , the latter with sedimentation parameters @xmath65 and 5 . for the @xmath71 and the no - cloud models ,",
    "3 gravities are shown ( @xmath98 , 5 , and 5.5 ) . only @xmath99 is shown for @xmath65 .",
    "model effective temperatures are given on the right axis of figure 9 .",
    "the general agreement between the observed l colors and the @xmath65 models seen in figures 4 , 8 and 9 , suggests that the @xmath0 colors of the l dwarfs can be explained by a uniform global cloud model . the cloud s vertical extent and optical depth are limited by sedimentation .",
    "models with much less or much more efficient sedimentation would be generally be too red or too blue , respectively , than most of the l dwarf population",
    ". however the existence of a few dwarfs that are redder and a few that are bluer than most (  5.5 ) implies that about 10% of the l dwarf population would require more extreme models .",
    "these variations could arise from either metallicity or sedimentation efficiency differences between objects .",
    "however , the @xmath95 models turn too slowly to the blue and reach the colors of the bluest t dwarfs at @xmath7 band magnitudes that are too faint . faced with this difficulty of finite cloud layers taking too long to disappear in models like those of tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) , burgasser et al .",
    "( 2002b ) propose a different mechanism for the l - to - t transition .",
    "drawing on a suggestion from ackerman & marley ( 2001 ) , burgasser et al .",
    "( 2002b ) propose that the l to t transition region is marked by the appearance of holes in the global cloud deck , not unlike those seen in the `` 5-@xmath100 hot spots '' on jupiter .",
    "deeply - seated flux , particularly in the clear @xmath38 and @xmath7 windows would then pour out of these holes , pushing the disk - integrated color to the blue .",
    "indeed burgasser et al . ( 2002b ) found that a relatively small fraction of holes would appreciably move a late l - type object towards the blue in @xmath57 .",
    "they argued that such a mechanism would explain the brightening observed at @xmath38 and @xmath7 , and not at other bands , across the transition , and also the observed resurgence in feh absorption from the latest ls to the early to mid ts .    to illustrate the effect such holes might have , we have joined with a dotted line the magnitude : color values for the cloudy and cloud - free models at @xmath101 k in both figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the agreement between the datapoints for t1 to t3 dwarfs and the cloudy to cloud - free interpolations in figures 8 and 9 is generally good .",
    "the parameters @xmath101 k and @xmath102 4.55.5 appear to bracket the known transition objects in these plots , in fair agreement with golimowski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who show that there is an apparent plateau at @xmath103 1450  k for types l7 to t4 .",
    "the cloud clearing model simply posits that at a given effective temperature the global cloud deck begins to break up , perhaps because it has settled sufficiently deeply into the convection zone that it becomes subject to the global circulation pattern .",
    "the observed constancy of @xmath60 across the transition is not required by this hypothesis , although it does raise problems for the tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) suggestion of continuous cooling across the transition .",
    "if the clearing does happen over a narrow temperature range , with a large spectroscopic change occurring over a small change in temperature and luminosity as the brown dwarf cools , we would not expect to discover many early t dwarfs .",
    "however about one - third of our t dwarf sample is made up of types t0t3.5 , with a possible dearth of t34 types ( figure 3 ) .",
    "a study of the spectral type distribution in an sdss magnitude - limited sample will be the subject of a future paper ( collinge et al .",
    "2002 ) .      rather than relying on spatial inhomogeneities , figures",
    "8 and 9 suggests a third possibility for the l to t transition , which we term the `` sudden downpour '' model .",
    "the @xmath95 models do a reasonably good job of reproducing the colors of the latest l dwarfs . like the thin tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) cloud ,",
    "models with more efficient sedimentation ( larger @xmath62 ) turn off the l dwarf cooling track sooner ( at brighter magnitudes ) than seems to be consistent with the available data .",
    "however , one might argue that l dwarfs first cool at essentially constant @xmath104 , then at around @xmath105 , @xmath62 begins to gradually increase from @xmath106 to infinity at roughly fixed effective temperature .",
    "this rapid increase in the efficiency of sedimentation would , in essence , produce a torrential rain of condensed iron and silicate grains . unlike the tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) mechanism",
    "this would begin at the late l spectral type for all masses .",
    "t1 to t4 dwarfs would represent different stages of this cloud thinning process .",
    "figures 8 and 9 shows where the @xmath71 models would lie , for example .",
    "once grains are essentially completely removed from the atmosphere the object would continue to evolve and cool .",
    "a useful diagnostic for evaluating the various transition models may be gravity .",
    "the sudden downpour mechanism , for example , would predict that the t3.5 dwarf sdss j1750@xmath11759 ( see figure 8) would have @xmath107 .",
    "evolution tracks for the patchy cloud model curve downward at blue @xmath57 compared to the straight lines shown in the figure and thus this model would predict a smaller gravity , say @xmath108 . on the other hand , tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) would predict that since this relative bright t dwarf has already made the transition to blue @xmath57 , it must be relatively low in mass and have a substantially lower gravity , say @xmath109 .",
    "there are also gravity tests among the late l dwarfs , although these are more subtle since all of the models would predict that the faintest and reddest l dwarfs will have progressively higher masses .",
    "tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) predict that the lowest mass dwarfs turn to the blue relatively early .",
    "the downpour model also predicts that lower masses turn blueward earlier than higher masses as can be seen by studying the tracks for the various gravities in the @xmath71 case .",
    "however this turn off happens at later spectral types than in the tsuji & nakajima model and is accompanied by a subsequent brightening in @xmath50 .",
    "for example the l7 dwarf labeled in figure 8 could have @xmath110 under the cloud clearing and downpour models , but tsuji & nakajima ( 2003 ) would predict a higher minimum gravity , likely around 5.3 or so . certainly there are hints in figure 8 that there is a width in @xmath50 to the transition and this will facilitate such tests .",
    "there are also other diagnostics to consider .",
    "the patchy - cloud model straightforwardly accounts for the resurgence seen in feh absorption across the transition ( burgasser et al .",
    "2002b ) , and it is not clear that other models can account for this .",
    "clearly more modeling of all mechanisms must be completed to better define gravity and other diagnostics of the transition mechanism .",
    "unfortunately gravity indicators among the late l and early t field dwarfs are elusive and it may be difficult to use them to definitively test the models .",
    "( one might expect that the li test ( martn , rebolo & magazzu 1994 ) could be used to identify high gravity dwarfs since only brown dwarfs more massive than 0.06  m@xmath111 will have burned li during their evolution . as a practical matter , however , the li line at 0.6708  @xmath12 m in late l and early t dwarfs is detectable only with the largest telescopes due to the lack of continuum flux in this region . also , in t dwarf atmospheres licl and lioh become the dominant li bearing molecule ( lodders 1999 ) and these species are currently undetectable . )",
    "self consistent evolutionary models be developed as well as mechanisms to explain the onset of either patchiness or varying @xmath62 at a particular @xmath60 .",
    "we plan to more fully explore these issues in a future paper .",
    "discrepant objects to note in figures 8 and 9 are kelu-1 ( l3 ) , sdss j0423@xmath20414 ( t0 ) and 2mass j0415@xmath20935 ( t9 ) .",
    "2mass j0415@xmath20935 is significantly redder in @xmath57 than the models would predict , as discussed in  5.6 .",
    "kelu-1 and sdss j0423@xmath20414 are both superluminous by about 0.75 magnitudes , suggesting that they may be pairs of identical dwarfs in unresolved binary systems .",
    "kelu-1 has been imaged by @xmath37 and by keck , with no evidence of duplicity found ( martn et al .",
    "1999a ; koerner et al . 1999 ) , while sdss j0423@xmath20414 has not been imaged at high resolution to our knowledge .",
    "cruz et al . ( 2003 ) classify this dwarf as l7.5 using red spectra ; however , ch@xmath42 bands are clearly seen in the g02 spectrum ( figure 3 in g02 ) , and the bolometric correction ( i.e. ratio of @xmath5-band flux to total luminosity ) is more compatible with an infrared classification of t than l ( golimowski et al .",
    "although it has been suggested that this object consists of a late l and early t close pair ( burgasser et al .",
    "2003b ) a discrepancy between the optical and infrared types is not unexpected .",
    "as described in  5.2 , different wavelength regions probe different levels of the photosphere .",
    "it is likely that the optically derived spectral types are more representative of effective temperature , and as golimowski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show that there is an apparent plateau at @xmath103 1450  k for types l7 to t4 we would expect optical types to be earlier than infrared types for the l / t transition objects .",
    "the earlier optical classification is in fact observed for six l8 to t0 dwarfs in our sample , as indicated in table 9 .",
    "although the clear atmosphere models do a good job of reproducing the colors of the later t dwarfs in the @xmath112 diagram ( figure 6 ) , they tend to predict bluer @xmath57 colors for these objects than is observed ( figures 8 and 9 ) . this seems to be a generic problem with clear models ( see also tsuji & nakajima 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath57 result implies that the model tracks shown in figure 6 should slide up and to the right , consistent with the suggestion in  5.6 that the temperature contours are too warm . because of the overall shape of the model contours the quality of the fit in @xmath112 would remain about the same .",
    "the discussion of the gravity signature seen in @xmath4 is still qualitatively valid , although sdss j1110@xmath10116 would be expected to have a somewhat higher gravity .    finally , we consider detectability limits for sdss using figures 3 , 8 and 9 .",
    "many sdss t dwarfs have to be selected as @xmath22-only objects and they are either not detected or only barely detected at @xmath23 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the nominal ( 5@xmath17 , better than @xmath113 seeing ) @xmath22 detection limit is 20.8 , and the faintest sdss t dwarf discovered to date is close to this limit , at @xmath22 = 20.4 . since the colors of late",
    "( e.g. t8 ) dwarfs are @xmath1143.8 , the corresponding @xmath7 limit is @xmath11516.6 ; table  9 therefore indicates that sdss should be able to detect t9 dwarfs to 10 pc .",
