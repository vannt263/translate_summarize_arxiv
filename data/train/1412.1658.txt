    "@xcite introduced the of?p category for massive o stars displaying recurrent spectral variations in certain spectral lines , sharp emission or pcygni profiles in hei and the balmer lines , and strong ciii emission lines around 4650 .",
    "after the first discovery of a longitudinal magnetic field of the order of 200 g in the of?p star hd191612 @xcite , the search for a presence of a magnetic field in remaining other of?p stars has been undertaken using fors2 spectropolarimetric observations by the magori collaboration and using espadons and narval observations by the mimes collaboration .",
    "only five galactic of?p stars are presently known : hd108 , ngc1624 - 2 , cpd@xmath02561 , hd148937 , and hd191612 @xcite , and all of them show evidence for the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .    among the five known of?p stars only the star cpd@xmath02561 has not been studied in detail yet , neither with spectroscopy / spectropolarimetry nor in x - rays .",
    "previous observations of the of?p star cpd@xmath02561 by @xcite revealed a longitudinal magnetic field of the order of a few hundred gauss at a significance level of more that 3@xmath3 .    due to the relative faintness of cpd@xmath02561 with @xmath4=10.1 ,",
    "it was only scarcely studied in the past .",
    "@xcite acquired radial velocities of 35 ob stars with carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen anomalies and found variability of a few emission lines with a probable period of 17days .",
    "@xcite mentioned that cpd@xmath02561 undergoes extreme spectral transformations very similar to those of hd191612 , on a timescale of weeks , inferred from the variable emission intensity of the ciii @xmath5",
    "464746504652 triplet .",
    "also the spectropolarimetric observations of @xcite on three consecutive nights in 2011 revealed strong variations in several hydrogen and helium line profiles .    according to @xcite , cpd@xmath02561",
    "is currently monitored by barb et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite list in their table1 fundamental parameters and a rotation period of 70d for this star .",
    "the most recent published result on cpd@xmath02561 reports on a 73.41-day rotation period , probably deduced from spectroscopic monitoring @xcite .",
    "the presented study is the continuation of the monitoring of the magnetic field of cpd@xmath02561 over its rotation period with fors1/2 at the vlt . using service mode observations",
    ", we succeeded in covering a significant part of the rotation cycle . in sect .",
    "[ sect : obs ] , we give an overview of our spectropolarimetric observations and magnetic field measurements with vlt / fors2 , followed by the discussion of the distinct spectral variability revealed in the fors2 spectra . section  [ sect : xrays ] is devoted to x - ray observations obtained with the _ suzaku x - ray observatory_. finally , we summarize the results of our observations in sect.[sect : concl ] .",
    "sixteen new spectropolarimetric observations of the of?p star cpd@xmath02561 were carried out from 2013 december 5 to 30 in service mode at the european southern observatory with fors2 mounted on the 8-m antu telescope of the vlt .",
    "this multi - mode instrument is equipped with polarization analyzing optics , comprising super - achromatic half - wave and quarter - wave phase retarder plates , and a wollaston prism with a beam divergence of 22@xmath6 in standard resolution mode .",
    "polarimetric spectra were obtained with the grism  600b and the narrowest slit width of 0@xmath74 to achieve a spectral resolving power of @xmath8 .",
    "the use of the mosaic detector with a pixel size of 15@xmath9 m allowed us to cover a spectral range , from 3250 to 6215 , which includes all hydrogen balmer lines from h@xmath10 to the balmer jump .    from the raw fors2 data ,",
    "the parallel and perpendicular beams are extracted using a pipeline written in the midas environment by t.  szeifert , the very first fors instrument scientist .",
    "this pipeline reduction by default includes background subtraction .",
    "a unique wavelength calibration frame is used for each night .",
    "a first description of the assessment of the longitudinal magnetic field measurements using fors1/2 spectropolarimetric observations was presented in our previous work ( e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) .    to minimize the cross - talk effect , and to cancel errors from different transmission properties of the two polarised beams ,",
    "a sequence of subexposures at the retarder position angles @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 , etc .",
    "is usually executed during observations . moreover",
    ", the reversal of the quarter wave plate compensates for fixed errors in the relative wavelength calibrations of the two polarised spectra .",
    "the @xmath13 spectrum is calculated using : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 indicate the position angle of the retarder waveplate and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the ordinary and extraordinary beams , respectively .",
    "rectification of the @xmath13 spectra was performed in the way described by @xcite .",
    "null profiles , @xmath19 , are calculated as pairwise differences from all available @xmath4 profiles . from these ,",
    "3@xmath3-outliers are identified and used to clip the @xmath4 profiles .",
    "this removes spurious signals , which mostly come from cosmic rays , and also reduces the noise .",
    "a full description of the updated data reduction and analysis will be presented in a separate paper ( schller et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the mean longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath20 , is measured on the rectified and clipped spectra based on the relation @xmath21    where @xmath4 is the stokes parameter that measures the circular polarization , @xmath22 is the intensity in the unpolarized spectrum , @xmath23 is the effective land factor , @xmath24 is the electron charge , @xmath25 is the wavelength , @xmath26 is the electron mass , @xmath27 is the speed of light , @xmath28 is the wavelength derivative of stokes  @xmath22 , and @xmath29 is the mean longitudinal ( line - of - sight ) magnetic field .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field was measured using the entire spectrum including all available absorption and emission lines .",
    "the feasibility of longitudinal magnetic field measurements in massive stars using low - resolution spectropolarimetric observations was demonstrated by previous studies of o and b - type stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that we do not differentiate between absorption and emission lines , since the relation between the stokes @xmath4 signal and the slope of the spectral line wing , as given by eq.([eqn : vi ] ) , holds for both type of lines , so that the signals of emission and absorption lines add up rather than cancel . for simplification , we assume a typical land factor of @xmath30 for all lines .",
    "the mean longitudinal magnetic field @xmath29 is defined by the slope of the weighted linear regression line through the measured data points , where the weight of each data point is given by the squared signal - to - noise ratio of the stokes @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "the formal @xmath31 error of @xmath29 is obtained from the standard relations for weighted linear regression .",
    "this error is inversely proportional to the rms signal - to - noise ratio of stokes @xmath4 . finally ,",
    "the factor @xmath32 is applied to the error determined from the linear regression , if larger than 1 .",
    "furthermore , we have carried out monte carlo bootstrapping tests .",
    "these are most often applied with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard errors . in these tests , we generate 250000 samples that have the same size as the original data set and analyse the distribution of the @xmath29 determined from all these newly generated data sets .",
    "the measurement uncertainties obtained before and after monte carlo bootstrapping tests were found to be in close agreement indicating the absence of reduction flaws .",
    "additionally , to check the stability of the spectral lines along the full sequence of sub - exposures , we have compared the profiles of several spectral lines recorded in the parallel beam with the retarder waveplate at @xmath15 .",
    "the same was done for spectral lines recorded in the perpendicular beam .",
    "the line profiles looked pretty much identical within the noise .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the presence of such a hot plasma component with an emission measure that is roughly half the emission measure of the cooler spectral component ( or about a third of the total emission measure ) , is a special property that is observed only in a handful of stars .",
    "the average x - ray plasma temperature , @xmath33 , determined from spectral fits of cpd@xmath02561 ( @xmath34kev , see table  [ tab : suzaku ] ) is higher than found even in strongly magnetic b - type stars @xcite .",
    "however , such high temperatures are deduced from the analysis of all previously studied x - ray spectra of of?p - type stars as well as the o7fp - type star @xmath35oric @xcite . the presence of the hard spectral component can be explained by wind streams from two opposite directions of the magnetosphere colliding at the terminal speed @xmath36 and thus producing strong shocks where the plasma is heated up to @xmath37mk @xcite .",
    "in this work , we used high quality fors2 polarimetric spectra of the of?p star cpd@xmath02561 to carry out magnetic field measurements and to study spectral variability . with 20 observations at our disposal , it became now possible to investigate the spectral variability of cpd@xmath02561 over approximately half of the rotation cycle .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field variation can be well represented by the recently reported rotational periodicity of 73.41d .    using the current mean longitudinal magnetic field measurements and assuming that the star is an oblique dipole rotator",
    ", we estimate that the polar strength of the surface dipole @xmath1 is larger than 1.15 kg .",
    "the comparison of the spectral behaviour of cpd@xmath02561 with that of another of?p star , hd148937 of similar spectral type , reveals remarkable differences in the degree of variability between both stars .",
    "since the reason for the variability in magnetic massive stars is usually referred to rotationally modulated emission from a magnetically constrained plasma , it is possible that the low - amplitude spectral variability of hd148937 is caused by the viewing geometry , i.e. the rotation axis of hd148937 must be viewed at relatively low inclination , whereas cpd@xmath02561 is observed at higher inclination closer to the stellar equator where plasma emission is optically thick according to the mwc model by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the inclination angle of hd148937 could be large while the obliquity between the magnetic field axis and the rotation angle is small .",
    "furthermore , differences in the appearance of the line profiles are detected in the spectra recorded in different years , indicating that profiles are not strictly repeatable due to either uncertainties in the rotation period or due to intrinsic variability caused by changes in the amount or distribution of emitting material with time in the magnetosphere of cpd@xmath02561 .",
    "additional spectra and spectropolarimetric observations over the whole rotation cycle are needed to better constrain the magnetic field model of this star .",
    "our x - ray observations obtained with the _ suzaku x - ray observatory _ agree well with the supposition of the presence of the magnetically confined stellar wind as we find evidence for a hard component with @xmath38kev .",
    "this component is much harder than typical for a single non - magnetic ob stars .",
    "unfortunately , as our observations had the total duration of about 7.5h , no conclusion can be drawn from these data about the rotation modulation of the x - ray flux .",
    "one important task for future x - ray studies is to obtain detailed information on the variability of x - rays and to search for the periodicity usually expected in massive stars with the x - ray emitting confined winds .",
    "we thank the referee john landstreet for useful comments to the original manuscript .",
    "based on observations collected with the _ suzaku x - ray observatory _ , data obtained with eso telescopes at the la silla paranal observatory under programme i d 092.d-0209(a ) , and data obtained from the eso science archive facility under request number mschoeller51303 .",
