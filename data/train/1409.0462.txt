    "the types of colliding hadrons should be irrelevant ; @xmath12 is formed from exchanged photons or pomerons , so there are three classes : @xmath15 @xmath16 , and @xmath16 .",

    "therefore the data reported here include events where one or both protons ( meaning @xmath11 or @xmath51 ) dissociated into a cluster of particles , all with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 was the limit of the cdf detector coverage .",
    "the cdf detector is described in ref .. it had cylindrical silicon strips ( not used in these studies ) and drift chamber tracking in the central region , @xmath54 , in a 1.4 tesla solenoidal field .",
    "the drift chamber had 96 layers of wires , axial and @xmath55 stereo , with 180 @xmath56 m hit measurement precision from the drift time , and pulse - height measurement providing some particle identification by de / dx ionization .",
    "a barrel of time - of - flight counters ( tof ) was outside the tracking , and had @xmath57 @xmath58 scintillator bars with a hamamatsu r7761 photomultiplier ( pmt ) on each end , giving a time resolution of @xmath37120 ps .",

    "the beam ( true ) rapidity was @xmath64 at @xmath7 = 1960 ( 900 ) gev , which allowed very little rapidity for undetected dissociation products .",
    "cdf estimated the fraction of final events with undetected diffraction dissociation to be @xmath658% in the two - photon mediated lepton pair events , and @xmath66 1% in exclusive di - photon production by .",
    "for the most recent results only the closest station ( bsc-1 ) could be used .",
    "bsc-1 , covering @xmath67 , had no transverse magnetic field upstream and it was preceded by two radiation lengths of lead to convert photons",
    ". there were four pmts covering four azimuthal quadrants .",
    "the  or \" of these counters was put in veto in the level - one trigger for these studies , reducing pile - up from more than one interaction in the same bunch crossing , as well as excluding a large fraction of the inelastic collisions , while retaining the cep reactions .",
    "the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing , @xmath68 , was as high as eight at the beginning of the later stores , so the cep trigger was only active when and if @xmath68 had decreased to @xmath65 3 .",
    "all cross - section measurements were made with no additional inelastic collisions , and cdf defined the _ effective _ luminosity @xmath69 as the integrated luminosity taking that into account . since the ( 36 ) colliding bunches did not all have the same @xmath68 the calculation was made bunch - by - bunch . as the maximum rapidity coverage of cdf with bsc-1 was @xmath70 = 5.9 , higher mass dissociations",
    "were included , and more so at @xmath7 = 1960 gev than at 900 gev .",
    "all data reported here are at @xmath7 = 1960 gev except for some @xmath71 data@xcite .",
    "both forward regions were also equipped with cherenkov luminosity counters ( clc ) , consisting of 48 gas ( isobutane ) tubes pointing to the interaction region , each viewed by a pmt .",
    "these arrays covered @xmath72 , with 16 units in each of three @xmath61 layers .",
    "in addition to monitoring the bunch - by - bunch luminosity , @xmath73 , they were included in the rapidity - gap selection .",
    "the use of zero - bias ( bunch crossing ) events to define an  empty detector \" when there was no inelastic collision with any particles in the acceptance ( @xmath74 or 5.9 ) was very important for these analyses .",
    "zero - bias events were recorded at a rate of about 1 s@xmath75 throughout the data taking .",
    "the zero - bias data was divided into two classes of events : ( 1 ) no tracks , no clc hits and no muon stubs , classed as  no interaction \" , and ( 2 ) all other events , classed as ( one or more )  interaction \" .",
    "cdf then plotted the summed pulse height distributions for each detector , namely the central em and had calorimeters ( @xmath76 1.3 ) , the plug calorimeter ( @xmath77 ) , the miniplug calorimeter and the clc and bsc counters .",
    "the  no interaction \" distributions show the summed noise , and a cut was applied that includes @xmath3799% of empty events in each subdetector .",
    "the  interaction \" events are mostly well separated in pulse height , with much larger signals , apart from a small noise peak corresponding to single interactions with no particles in a particular subdetector .",
    "one analysis used the pulse height distributions of the pmt in each subdetector with the highest signal ( the  _ hottest _ \" pmt ) instead of , or in addition to , the sum .",
    "thus while the cut on the total energy in the central calorimeters ( em + had ) was 2.8 gev , the requirement on the hottest pmt was 80 ( 200 ) mev for the em ( had ) calorimeters .",
    "the values quoted are examples ; they were optimized for each analysis ( the data were taken over eight years ) .    with the chosen cuts defining  no interaction \" in the full detector ,",
    "cdf then plotted the probability p(0 ) that the full detector was empty vs. @xmath73 , which should be an exponential since @xmath56 is a poisson distribution , with mean @xmath78 .",
    "the exponential fits were good , with intercepts p(0)@xmath79 at @xmath80 , confirming that the full detector is classed as empty when there are no collisions .",
    "the slope is @xmath81 , allowing a measurement of the inelastic cross section by taking the luminosity from the calibrated ( to @xmath826% ) clc counters and correcting for the ratio @xmath83 . the @xmath71 data at 1960 gev is in agreement with @xmath84 mb from a global fit including totem values @xcite , and using @xmath85 as expected from the minimum - bias rockefeller ( mbr ) event generator@xcite . for the corresponding 900 gev data",
    "the clc counters were not calibrated and cdf used the predicted @xmath86 = ( 47.4@xmath823.0 ) mb with @xmath87 to normalize the cross sections .    for the @xmath88 physics events cdf used the same  empty detector \" criteria , just excluding the @xmath12 decay products and the surrounding calorimeter clusters . in some analyses",
    "the noise cuts were made on the pulse - height sums , in some on the hottest pmt , and in some cases on both ; see the original papers for details .",

    "motivated by a search for exclusive two - photon production ( see section 4 ) cdf took data@xcite with a trigger on two em clusters in @xmath76 2.0 with @xmath90 5 gev , with bsc-1 in veto .",
    "after all the exclusivity cuts there were 16 events with exactly two oppositely - charged tracks pointing to clusters with had : em ratios and shower shapes consistent with those of electrons .",
    "the azimuthal angle difference of all pairs was @xmath91 0.1 , consistent with the lpair generator@xcite prediction together with the cdf detector simulation , as were the other measured distributions .",

    "this was the first observation , with 5.4@xmath95 , of two - photon processes in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in the cross section for @xmath96 , the  elastic \" case , is only @xmath37 1% .",
    "it is a qed process with only small corrections from the electromagnetic form factor of the proton and from shadowing corrections ( i.e. a simultaneous pomeron exchange , small because the impact parameter for photon exchange events is usually @xmath97 fm ) . in the cdf case , with diffraction dissociation of the protons allowed , the uncertainty is larger ( @xmath37 15% ) .",
    "agreement of the above measurements with theory gave confidence in the method of selecting these rare exclusive events ( @xmath98 of @xmath99 ) .",
    "two - photon collisions have become an important field at the lhc , where the ( quasi - real ) photon fluxes extend to @xmath100 1 tev .",
    "exclusive di - lepton production : @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with equal cross sections , can be measured with @xmath103 400 gev / c@xmath46 .",
    "the exclusive dimuon events can be used to check the momentum scale of forward proton spectrometers , since both proton momenta are known from the dimuon kinematics .",
    "even if one proton dissociates , or is not in the acceptance of the forward spectrometer , the momentum of the other proton is well known .",

    "one intriguing @xmath89 candidate had @xmath112 = 92.1 gev / c@xmath46 , but there were hits in the bsc counters and the event was rejected for that reason .",
    "fewer than 0.01 exclusive @xmath47 events were expected in the standard model .",

    "their kinematics agreed with the lpair predictions@xcite after folding in the cdf detector simulation .",
    "all events had ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 1 gev / c . these conditions ( together with no associated tracks ) should allow such events to be measured with some pile - up , but that was not done .",
    "the same analysis was carried out with 2.2@xmath116 events , of which three survived all exclusivity cuts . since",
    "exclusive @xmath117 production is forbidden , this is a control on the background from undetected particles .",
    "with the aim of observing exclusive @xmath119 cdf installed a trigger requiring two muons with @xmath120 1.4 gev / c and @xmath121 , with a veto on bsc-1 .",
