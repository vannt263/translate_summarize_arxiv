    "computer simulations have added a great deal to our knowledge of relaxation in supercooled liquids .",
    "a seminal series of studies was performed by kob and andersen @xcite who were interested in comparing the results of molecular dynamics simulations to the predictions of the mode - coupling theory @xcite .",
    "they observed that as the temperature was lowered the mode - coupling theory gave a good qualitative description of the relaxation of the liquid .",
    "specifically , they found that the long - time self - diffusion coefficient and a characteristic relaxation time showed power law behavior as @xmath0 was approached . since their investigation",
    ", this temperature has been referred to as the mode - coupling transition temperature for the kob - andersen lennard - jones mixture .",
    "later work @xcite demonstrated that there is no true vanishing of the self - diffusion coefficient or true divergence of the @xmath1 relaxation time at @xmath2 .",
    "this is similar to what is observed experimentally for most glass formers @xcite .",
    "there exists power law like behavior of the relaxation time as a temperature @xmath2 is approached and close to @xmath2 there is a crossover to a different relaxation scenario which extends to the laboratory glass transition @xmath3 , defined as the temperature at which the viscosity equals @xmath4 poise @xcite .",
    "many simulations performed since the kob and andersen study have resulted in the following relaxation scenario in supercooled liquids around the crossover temperature @xmath2 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the motion of particles in a slightly supercooled liquid is homogeneous and the self part of the van hove correlation function @xcite is approximately gaussian at all times . at lower temperatures",
    "the self part of the van hove correlation function deviates significantly from gaussian , the motion of the particles is strongly heterogeneous , and , on an intermediate time scale ( up to so - called exchange time ) , the particles can be separated by their individual relaxation times .",
    "it is generally believed that at short times the particles are confined to cages of neighboring particles and a `` cooperative motion '' @xcite of particles has to occur to facilitate cage escape @xcite .",
    "the timescale of this cooperative motion increases with decreasing temperature . in the original studies",
    "@xcite it was assumed that this time scale is around the peak in the non - gaussian parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance over which a particle moved in time @xmath7 .",
    "it has been accepted that the peak position of @xmath8 `` roughly locates the time of maximum dynamic heterogeneity '' @xcite . while this is a natural first choice , there is no a priori reason to choose this time .",
    "it has been shown that the van hove correlation function deviates strongly from a gaussian distribution over a much longer time scale @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also possible to identify particles which remain slower than other particles for time much longer than the time scale given by the peak position of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we should point out that , although the time scale of the peak position of @xmath8 is often singled out in connection with dynamic heterogeneity , it has also been recognized that there exists dynamic heterogeneity on a much longer time scale , and a four - point correlation function that is sensitive to this longer - time heterogeneity has been defined and investigated ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    in this work",
    "we examine the relaxation of a supercooled liquid using brownian dynamics computer simulations .",
    "experiments conducted on brownian systems ( _ i.e. _ on colloidal suspensions ) have so far failed to show any significant departure from the power law behavior of the self - diffusion coefficient and the characteristic relaxation time @xcite .",
    "thus , it was suggested that the predictions of the original ( also known as `` idealized '' ) mode - coupling theory provide a good description of the relaxation of the fluid .",
    "however , it has since been demonstrated using computer simulations that the relaxation of a supercooled fluid is the same for newtonian dynamics @xcite , stochastic dynamics @xcite , and brownian dynamics @xcite . in particular , in computer simulations departures from mode - coupling - like power laws and emergence of hopping - like motion have been observed for all three microscopic dynamics .",
    "the qualitative difference between experimental results ( which do not find deviations from mode - coupling - like power laws ) and theoretical ones ( which do ) remains unexplained .",
    "the focus of this work is the crossover from the high temperature homogeneous relaxation of the slightly supercooled fluid to the low temperature relaxation around @xmath2 .",
    "we show that , while the mode - coupling transition temperature can not be unambiguously determined from the computer simulation results , the commonly reported temperature is the crossover temperature for two different modes of relaxation .",
    "furthermore , we define and calculate a time - dependent function that vanishes identically for a gaussian diffusion process .",
    "this new function @xmath9 , hereafter called a new non - gaussian parameter , has a peak at a time at which the relaxation seems the most heterogeneous .",
    "this time is always longer than a characteristic decay time of the incoherent intermediate scattering function @xcite that is known as the @xmath1 relaxation time .",
    "moreover , the peak position of the new non - gaussian parameter has temperature dependence very similar to that of the @xmath1 relaxation time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ simdetails ]",
    "we briefly describe the simulation . in section [ differentpowerlaws ]",
    "we present results for the mean square displacement , the self - diffusion coefficient , the incoherent intermediate scattering functions , and the @xmath1 relaxation time ( a preliminary report of some of these results appeared in ref .",
    "we show that two different power - law fits can be obtained depending on the range of temperatures used . in section [ distributions ]",

    "for the lowest temperature the plateau region spans several decades in time .",

    "it represents a localization of the particles on intermediate time scales and has been observed in many simulations of glassy systems @xcite .",
    "note that there is no true plateau in the mean square displacement versus time and the slope of the mean square displacement versus time decreases monotonically .",

    "the mode - coupling theory has been used extensively to describe the relaxation in supercooled liquids and the glass transition .",
    "it correctly describes many qualitative features of the glass transitions observed experimentally and in computer simulations .",
    "the most notable success of the mode - coupling theory is that it correctly describes the two step decay of the intermediate scattering functions and the qualitative features of the mean square displacement as a function of time .",
    "the idealized mode - coupling theory predicts power law divergence of the @xmath1 relaxation time and power law vanishing of the self - diffusion coefficient at a transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "it has been observed that there is power law like behavior of the @xmath1 relaxation time and the diffusion coefficient in simulations and experiments close to a temperature @xmath2 .",
    "however , the structural arrest predicted by the mode - coupling theory does not occur at @xmath2 , but rather there appears to be a crossover to a different relaxation scenario and the mode - coupling transition is said to be `` avoided '' .",
    "we performed brownian dynamics simulations of a frequently studied glass forming binary mixture for a large range of temperatures .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath1 relaxation time and the diffusion coefficient were similar to what was observed in previous simulations of the same system @xcite .",
    "we found that the diffusion coefficient and the @xmath1 relaxation time can also be fit to a power law where the transition temperature is @xmath58 which is lower than the generally accepted mode - coupling transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "however , by examining the probability distributions of the logarithm of single particle displacements , @xmath95 , we demonstrated that the crossover from the high temperature diffusive relaxation of the particles to low temperature hopping - like motion occurs near the generally accepted mode - coupling transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the change in the relaxation processes are evident when one examines the distribution of the logarithm of single particle displacements @xmath95 . at higher temperatures",
    "there is one peak in @xmath95 whose position increases for increased time . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the distribution becomes broad at a time scale right after the plateau region of the mean square displacement . at the lowest temperatures examined in this study , there are two distinct peaks in @xmath95 for both the a and b particles .",
    "the two peaks are evidence that on an intermediate time scale the particles can be separated by their individual relaxation time , and thus are dynamically heterogeneous . moreover , the minimum between the peaks is smaller for the b particles than for the a particles at a fixed temperature .",
    "the dependence on particles size of the probability distributions is similar to what was observed in earlier simulations @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation of our results could be that the mode - coupling temperature does not have any physical significance and the crossover in supercooled liquid s dynamics is very smooth @xcite .",
    "while such an interpretation can not be excluded , we would like to advocate a more cautious conclusion : in order to identify a crossover temperature ( or a narrow crossover temperature _ range _ ) that one could interpret as mode - coupling temperature , one has to investigate not only power - law fits to transport coefficients and/or relaxation times but also whether microscopic dynamics is homogeneous and diffusive - like or heterogeneous and hopping - like .",
    "we would like to emphasize that although the mode - coupling theory , in its standard form , can not describe hopping - like dynamics , it does provide a reasonable @xcite description of dynamics in moderately supercooled fluids .",
    "we found that the typical non - gaussian parameter @xmath8 does a poor job of identifying the time scale on which the heterogeneous , hopping - like motion is most evident .",
    "we defined a new non - gaussian parameter @xmath134 . for temperatures in which there are two peaks in @xmath95 , @xmath120 has a peak occurring at a time @xmath131 in which the two peaks have approximately the same height . for times in which only one peak is present ,",
    "the peak position of @xmath120 identifies the time in which @xmath95 is widest .",
    "the position of the peak for @xmath8 and @xmath120 are the same for high temperatures , but the peak position of @xmath8 increases slower with decreasing temperature than the peak position of @xmath120",
    ". moreover , the peak position of @xmath120 has the same temperature dependence as the @xmath1 relaxation time .",
