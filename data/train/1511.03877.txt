    "the edges of one- and two - dimensional spinless or spin - triplet @xmath1-wave superconductors can host localized zero - energy excitations , so - called majorana bound states ( mbss ) or majorana zero - modes  named such because their second quantized operators are self - adjoint  @xcite .",
    "these mbss obey non - abelian exchange statistics , and the notion that they could therefore be utilized for topologically protected quantum computation  @xcite sparked an intense search for feasible realizations of the @xmath1-wave topological superconducting phase .",
    "concrete proposals included using superfluid states of cold fermionic atoms @xcite , heterostructures consisting of topological insulators , @xmath0-wave superconductors , and ferromagnetic insulators @xcite , or non - centrosymmetric superconductors with strong ( rashba ) spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .    arguably , one of the simplest and most promising ideas how to create an effective @xmath1-wave superconductor is to use a quasi - one - dimensional semiconducting nanowire with proximity - induced @xmath0-wave superconductivity and strong spin - orbit coupling , subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the effective spin - orbit field  @xcite . as the magnetic field increases ,",
    "the induced gap in the wire is expected to close and reopen , which signals a transition from a topologically trivial phase to a non - trivial ( effectively @xmath1-wave superconducting ) phase , where localized zero - energy mbss form at the ends of the wire .",
    "these proposals were rapidly followed by pioneering experiments , where tunneling spectroscopy into one end of the wire indeed showed a zero - bias peak appearing when the magnetic field was increased  @xcite , which was interpreted as a signature of the formation of mbss .    however , several of the experimental observations seemed to be incompatible with the interpretation in terms of a topological phase transition .",
    "for instance , a clear closing and reopening of the gap was never observed in experiment , and also the measured height of the zero - bias conductance peak was only a fraction of the theoretically predicted value of @xmath2 .",
    "soon it was pointed out that these `` inconsistencies '' could be attributed to realistic complications such as inhomogeneous depletion profiles , population of more than one transverse subband , disorder , or finite temperature  @xcite ; and within all these explanations the zero - bias peak could still be associated with mbss living at the ends of the wire .",
    "but also interpretations of the data _ without _ zero - energy mbss were proposed : robust zero - bias peaks in the conductance of a topologically trivial wire can , for instance , appear due to an interplay of disorder , finite temperature , and population of multiple subbands  @xcite , due to smooth confining potentials  @xcite , or due to the kondo effect  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the observed zero - bias peaks is thus still under debate , and identifying other , more distinguishing signatures of mbss in semiconducting nanowires would therefore be very useful .",
    "so far , proposals include using a superconductor - normal - superconductor ( sns ) setup to focus on the @xmath3-periodic josephson current  @xcite or the critical josephson current through a multiband wire  @xcite , measuring the actual localization of the zero - energy states at the ends of the wire , and observing the characteristic oscillations of the splitting of the zero - bias peak as a function of increasing magnetic field  @xcite . the observation of a @xmath3-periodic josephson current can be hampered by the finite overlap of the mbss , leading again to a regular @xmath4-periodic current  @xcite . probing the localization of the zero - energy mode would require measuring the local density of states in the wire by e.g.  scanning tunneling microscopy , which can not readily be performed on these wires .",
    "the characteristic oscillations of the split zero - bias peak have also proven to be difficult to observe : temperature broadening of the energy levels and a soft induced superconducting gap make it hard to clearly distinguish the oscillations of the mbs s energy in the topologically non - trivial phase from zero - bias crossings that are also present in the topologically trivial phase .",
    "the most decisive measurement would of course be the observation of non - abelian braiding statistics , but even the simplest braiding scheme requires a challenging experimental setup and delicate control  @xcite . a more tractable experiment that would allow for",
    "the distinction between the different possible origins of the zero - bias conductance peak is therefore a preferable stepping stone before moving on to more complicated braiding experiments .",
    "-wave superconductor covering two separate parts of the wire .",
    "the two superconductors @xmath5 and @xmath6 are connected by a grounded superconducting loop through which a flux @xmath7 can be threaded , resulting in a phase difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath8 is applied that couples to the electronic spins inside the wire , but does not add to @xmath7 .",
    "the wire is tunnel coupled to a probe lead at the left end which can be used for tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "( b ) more schematic view of the setup .",
    "the wire is oriented along the @xmath9-axis and @xmath8 lies in the @xmath10-plane , where the effective spin - orbit field is assumed to point along the @xmath11-axis.[fig1 ] ]    in this work we investigate in more detail the sns setup , where two separate parts of the wire are coupled to two separate bulk superconductors , interconnected by a superconducting loop to control the phase difference between them ( see the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . under the right circumstances",
    "there can emerge up to four low - energy mbss ( one at each ns boundary inside the wire ) , which are known to have very characteristic phase - dependent properties  @xcite .",
    "inspired by this , we suggest to study the differential conductance measured by an additional normal tunnel probe coupled to one end of the nanowire , rather than investigating the josephson current in the junction  @xcite . therefore the superconducting loop is needed to create a controllable phase difference across the junction , and it thus replaces the voltage bias inducing a time - dependent phase difference in ref .",
    "@xcite or the supercurrent bias in ref .",
    "we thus investigate a normal - superconductor - normal - superconductor ( n - sns ) junction , and look for signatures of the mbss in the differential conductance as measured through the probe . creating such a topological sns junction is feasible with the current state of experimental techniques , and probing by means of tunneling spectroscopy is standard practice in this field . we show that such an experiment should in principle allow to determine whether or not measured low - bias peaks in the differential conductance can be associated with non - local fermionic states formed by mbss inside the wire , and we believe that at present our proposal constitutes one of the most straightforward ways to experimentally verify the emergence of topological phases in a spin - orbit - coupled semiconducting nanowire .    in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the setup we have in mind and present a hamiltonian to model this system .",
    "we explain how one can calculate the differential conductance of this system from our model hamiltonian , and in section [ sec : results ] we present our numerical results .",
    "we examine the conductance of the wire for energies smaller than the superconducting gap , calculating the conductance spectrum as a function of applied magnetic field and of the phase difference between the two superconductors .",
    "we compare the spectra that result when the wire is in a topological phase and in a trivial phase , and we find that the conductance spectrum , when tunneling into one end of the wire , is only sensitive to the phase difference between the superconductors if the wire is in a topological phase .",
    "depending on the phase difference and the applied magnetic field , one to four low - energy subgap conductance peaks are visible : for zero phase difference , one strong zero - bias peak appears after entering the topological phase ; at higher magnetic fields this peak splits and starts to oscillate due to the increasing overlap of the two mbss at the ends of the wire . for a phase difference close to @xmath12",
    "we can see two more low - energy peaks , which we associate with the formation of two additional mbss close to the central normal region of the n - sns junction , where the superconducting phase changes sign . in section [ sec : effective_model ] we support our interpretation with a simple low - energy model based on a one - dimensional spinless @xmath1-wave superconductor with a phase discontinuity .",
    "this toy hamiltonian reproduces all important qualitative features of our numerical results and provides insight in the structure of the `` majorana subspace '' including the gradual gapping out of the central two majorana states when the phase difference is reduced to zero . finally , in section [ sec :",

    "we consider a semiconducting nanowire proximity coupled to two @xmath0-wave superconductors , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the two superconductors are connected by a superconducting loop such that the phase difference @xmath13 between them can be tuned by threading a flux @xmath7 through the loop .",
    "further , the wire is assumed to have strong spin - orbit interaction and we include a magnetic field that results in a zeeman splitting of the electronic states inside the wire but does not add to the flux @xmath7 . at its left end , the wire is tunnel coupled to a normal - metal probe which can be used to measure the differential conductance of the system , as indicated in fig .",

    "the nanowire of length @xmath14 is oriented along the @xmath9-axis and it is proximity coupled to two bulk @xmath0-wave superconductors of length @xmath15 and @xmath16 which have the effective pairing potentials @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "we assume the effective spin - orbit field to point along the @xmath11-axis and the zeeman field to lie in the @xmath10-plane , @xmath19 . by varying the direction of this field we can investigate both the topologically trivial state and non - trivial state of the system :",
    "the wire is in a trivial state when the zeeman field is parallel to the spin - orbit field ( @xmath20 ) , and can be in a topological state for non - parallel fields  @xcite .",
    "to model this system , we use the hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 describe the electrons in the nanowire and the two superconductors respectively , and @xmath25 accounts for the coupling between the different parts of the system .    assuming that the wire is thin enough such that only the lowest electronic subband is occupied , we write a one - dimensional hamiltonian in a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) form , @xmath26 , using the nambu spinors @xmath27^{t}$ ] , where the operator @xmath28 creates an electron with spin @xmath29 at position @xmath9 in the nanowire .",

    "the superconducting phases are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , corresponding to a phase difference @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the tunnel coupling between the nanowire and the two superconductors is described by the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath46 using the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 parameterizing the coupling strength .",
    "our aim is to calculate the differential conductance of this system , in a setup where one end of the wire is connected to a normal - metal tunnel probe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we start by writing an expression for the retarded green function @xmath50 for the electrons and holes in the nanowire .",
    "a convenient approach is to first integrate out the degrees of freedom of the two superconductors , resulting in an energy - dependent self - energy for the electrons in the wire .",
    "this self - energy ( i ) describes the proximity effect , i.e.  it introduces ( superconducting ) correlations between electrons and holes in the wire , and ( ii ) leads to a renormalization of all energy levels and quasi - particle weights in the wire .",
    "both effects would not be captured fully by a model where the @xmath0-wave pairing is introduced phenomenologically as a constant pairing potential  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments showed a large and hard induced superconducting gap in epitaxially grown superconductor - semiconductor nanowires  @xcite , and especially in that case retaining an energy - dependent self - energy can make a qualitative and important difference  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the fermi energy in the superconductor is by far the largest relevant energy scale in the problem .",
    "this allows us to write the self - energy for the electrons and holes in a wire coupled to a bulk superconductor with pairing potential @xmath51 as  @xcite @xmath52 } { \\sqrt{\\delta^2-(\\epsilon+i0^+)^2}},\\label{eq : se}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 parametrizes the strength of the coupling to the superconductor ( it is proportional to @xmath54 and to the normal - state density of states in the superconductor , and corresponds roughly to the normal - state tunneling rate of electrons into the superconductor at the fermi level ) and @xmath55 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "the self - energy ( [ eq : se ] ) is diagonal in position space , and for our setup ( involving two superconductors ) we thus find the total self - energy @xmath56 with this , we can write the green function for the electrons and holes in the wire as @xmath57_{z , z'}.\\ ] ]    from the green function , we can derive an expression for the scattering matrix of the nanowire . with",

    "the second line shows how this reflection matrix can be expressed in terms of the retarded green function of the electrons in the wire  @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath62 contains coupling elements describing the coupling between the basis states in the wire and the modes in the lead .",
    "finally , in terms of this reflection matrix the leading order ( linear ) differential conductance at zero temperature can be written as  @xcite @xmath63.\\label{eq : didv}\\ ] ] the term @xmath64 yields the contribution from normal electron transmission , and @xmath65 the contribution from andreev reflection .    for our numerical calculations ,",
    "we discretize the hamiltonian @xmath66 on a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath67 sites , and the green function @xmath68 is then found from inverting the @xmath69 matrix @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "the coupling matrix @xmath62 is constructed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a vector of length @xmath67 , @xmath73 is a @xmath74 identity matrix and @xmath75 parametrizes the strength of the coupling to the lead .",
    "this @xmath76 matrix thus describes a coupling between one single mode in the lead and site @xmath77 only .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : re ] ) that @xmath78 plays the role of a self - energy for the particles in the wire , so @xmath75 can be seen as the electronic tunneling rate through the barrier between the wire and the lead .",
    "the reflection matrix @xmath79 then follows straightforwardly and from that the differential conductance can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : didv ] ) .",
    "we express all energies in terms of the spin - orbit energy @xmath80ev , where the rashba spin - orbit strength is set to @xmath81 ev and the effective mass of the electrons in the nanowire is assumed to be @xmath82 , which is the value for bulk inas at room temperature . unless stated otherwise , the parameters we use in our simulations are as follows : the number of sites in the tight - binding model @xmath83 , the length of the wire @xmath84 m , the length of the two superconductors @xmath85 nm , the bulk superconductor gap @xmath86 , the wire s chemical potential @xmath87 , the coupling parameter @xmath88 , and the coupling of the wire to the lead @xmath89 . this combination of parameters results in an effective hopping matrix element @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the lattice constant , and a spin - orbit - induced ` spin - flip ' nearest - neighbor coupling of @xmath92 .",

    "[ fig2 ] we plot the differential conductance in units of @xmath99 as a function of bias voltage @xmath94 . fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the dependence on the strength of the zeeman field @xmath100 , assuming no phase difference , @xmath101 .",
    "we see that conductance is high for energies larger than the bulk superconducting gap , @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , at these energies the superconductors have a finite single - particle density of states which allows for tunneling of electrons from the lead into the superconductors . for energies smaller than the bulk gap",
    "we see several sharp peaks in the conductance .",
    "these peaks are caused by andreev bound states in the wire which can lead to andreev reflection of electrons at the lead - wire interface , effectively resulting in the transfer of cooper pairs from the lead into the superconductors . at @xmath103",
    ", there is an induced gap in the wire of @xmath104 , which agrees with the estimate @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath95 increases , the subgap states acquire a zeeman splitting resulting in a closing of the induced gap at @xmath106 .",
    "the gap does not reopen again , since the nanowire stays in the topologically trivial phase for @xmath93 .",
    "the bending of the peaks for energies close to @xmath107 is due to the renormalization of the energy levels in the wire by the proximity of the superconductor .",
    "if we would have used a phenomenological ( energy - independent ) induced gap in the wire hamiltonian , this bending would have been absent .",
    "we would like to point out that this zeeman - induced subgap structure has qualitative features in common with the subgap spectrum in the topological regime .",
    "after the gap closing , the spacing between the conductance peaks at zero bias , @xmath108 , becomes proportional to @xmath109 , which is the same as the expected @xmath95-dependence of the period of the oscillations due to a finite overlap of the majorana end states in the topological regime  @xcite . also , the amplitude of the oscillations of the `` splitting of the zero - bias peak '' grows steadily with increasing @xmath95 , as it is expected to do in the majorana case .",
    "therefore , if one would focus only on the @xmath95-dependence of the lowest - energy peaks in the conductance ( for instance , when other features of the subgap structure are smeared by noise or finite temperature ) , then it could be hard to distinguish the topological from the trivial regime .",
    "we now proceed by investigating the dependence of the conductance on the phase difference @xmath13 between the superconductors . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) we plot the differential conductance as a function of @xmath94 and @xmath13 with fixed @xmath110 , which is at the position of the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "we see that the positions of the peaks in the conductance do not depend significantly on @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , in the trivial regime the andreev bound states that are most strongly influenced by the phase difference between the two parts of the wire are expected to live mainly in the central normal region .",
    "the tunnel probe is attached to the left end of the wire and is thus predominantly coupled to the andreev levels that behave as zeeman - split quasiparticle states in the left proximity - induced superconductor .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the weak coupling between the tunnel probe at the end of the wire and states the middle of the wire in order to clearly distinguish the topologically trivial phase from the non - trivial phase in experiments .",
    "this can be ensured by having the length of the wire covered by superconductor @xmath5 longer than the coherence length of the induced superconductivity .",
    "this is straightforward to verify experimentally by checking that the measured conductance shows virtually no dependence on the phase difference between the superconductors in the topologically trivial phase .     for @xmath111 .",

    "[ fig3](a ) we plot the differential conductance in units of @xmath99 as a function of @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the phase differences @xmath101 , @xmath112 , and @xmath12 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "we see that after the induced gap closes at @xmath116 , it now reopens again , which signals a topological phase transition . for @xmath101 ( top plot ) and @xmath117 a strong zero - bias peak appears which at higher @xmath95 splits again and starts to oscillate .",
    "this zero - bias peak of conductance @xmath2 as well as its splitting and the oscillations at higher field are consistent with the formation of majorana end states at the boundaries of the topological regimes in the wire  @xcite . in our setup , one could in principle expect four majorana states in the topological phase , as indicated in the cartoon inside the plot .",
    "the majorana states labeled @xmath118 and @xmath119 are however strongly coupled through the central normal region , and thus will gap out to form a normal fermionic state .",
    "the two other majorana modes ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) are separated by @xmath14 and both are localized on the scale of the coherence length @xmath122 .",
    "this coherence length is a function of @xmath95 and the overlap of the two majorana wave functions increases with increasing @xmath95 .",
    "this explains the splitting of the zero - bias peak into two , and the oscillations are due to the oscillatory form of the majorana wave functions . in the case",
    "the two superconductors have opposite phases ( @xmath123 , bottom plot ) the situation is different .",
    "the effective @xmath1-wave pairing term now changes sign across the central normal region , creating two _ different _ topological phases in the two halves of the wire ( this induced @xmath1-wave superconductor falls in the bdi symmetry class ) . since the majorana modes @xmath118 and @xmath119 now belong to different phases , they can not recombine into a normal fermionic mode and gap out , and we thus expect to have _ four _ low - energy majorana modes in the system  @xcite , which will couple and split due to the finite size of the wire .",
    "the pair of majorana states @xmath120 and @xmath118 ( as well as the pair @xmath119 and @xmath121 ) still belongs to the same topological phase .",

    "we indeed see in our simulations two interlaced sets of oscillations which start at lower @xmath95 than those in the top plot and have both a larger period and amplitude .",
    "all these differences can be explained by the reduced separation of the overlapping majorana states .",
    "the middle plot ( @xmath125 ) shows an intermediate situation , where the two central modes @xmath118 and @xmath119 are still coupled , but the coupling is not strong enough to push their energies outside of the induced gap .    in fig .",

    "in contrast to the topologically trivial case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the low - energy conductance peaks now show a distinctive dependence on the phase difference . in the lower two plots we see how the peak due to the lowest excited state moves towards zero energy and increases in intensity when the phase difference goes from @xmath128 to @xmath12 .",
