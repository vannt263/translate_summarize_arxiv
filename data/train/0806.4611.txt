    "the nasa star and exoplanet database ( nsted ) is dedicated to collecting and serving vital published data involved in the search for and study of extrasolar planets and their host stars .",
    "the stellar and exoplanet services provide access to stellar parameters of potential exoplanet bearing stars along with exoplanet parameters .",
    "the stellar services provided by nsted include the following :    * data related to relatively bright nearby stars . * the ability to query for individual stars or search by stellar / planetary parameters .",
    "* published images , spectra , and time series data related to the stars in the database .",
    "complementary to this are the exoplanet services , which includes the following :    * general data and pubished parameters for the known exoplanets and host stars . * photometric and radial velocity data related to the known exoplanets . * a dedicated interface related to exoplanet transit surveys ( see companion paper by von braun et al .",

    "<S> the nasa star and exoplanet database ( nsted ) is a general purpose stellar archive with the aim of providing support for nasa s planet finding and characterization goals , stellar astrophysics , and the planning of nasa and other space missions . </S>",
    "<S> there are two principal components of nsted : a database of ( currently ) 140,000 nearby stars and exoplanet - hosting stars , and an archive dedicated to high precision photometric surveys for transiting exoplanets . </S>",
    "<S> we present a summary of the nsted stellar database , functionality , tools , and user interface . </S>",
    "<S> nsted currently serves the following kinds of data for 140,000 stars ( where available ) : coordinates , multiplicity , proper motion , parallax , spectral type , multiband photometry , radial velocity , metallicity , chromospheric and coronal activity index , and rotation velocity / period . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the following derived quantities are given wherever possible : distance , effective temperature , mass , radius , luminosity , space motions , and physical / angular dimensions of habitable zone . </S>",
    "<S> queries to nsted can be made using constraints on any combination of the above parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , nsted provides tools to derive specific inferred quantities for the stars in the database , cross - referenced with available extra - solar planetary data for those host stars . </S>",
    "<S> nsted can be accessed at . </S>"
