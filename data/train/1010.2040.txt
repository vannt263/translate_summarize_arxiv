    "the falicov - kimball model  @xcite ( fkm ) was primarily introduced to describe the metal - insulator transition of the mixed - valence compound smb@xmath2 .",
    "later on , the model became widely accepted as a minimal hamiltonian for studying several strongly correlated electron systems ,  @xcite in particular , heavy fermion compounds .",
    "@xcite in its original form , the fkm contains an itinerant @xmath0 band of electrons that interact via a local coulomb repulsion with localized @xmath1 electrons .",
    "the spin degree of freedom of the electrons is not included .",
    "the local @xmath1 electron number is strictly conserved and @xmath0-@xmath1 electron coherence can not be established .",
    "@xcite an explicit hybridization between @xmath1 and @xmath0 orbitals provides an opportunity to overcome this shortcoming .",
    "@xcite more recently , it was shown that a finite @xmath1 electron bandwidth also induces @xmath0-@xmath1 electron coherence , i.e. , it can lead to an excitonic condensate even in absence of an explicit interband hybridization .",
    "@xcite    these extended versions of the fkm were used to substantiate the exciting idea of electronic ferroelectricity ( efe ) .",
    "@xcite the ferroelectric phase only appears when the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals have opposite parity under spatial inversion .",
    "the concomitant spontaneous breaking of inversion symmetry results from a nonvanishing average of @xmath3 .",
    "since this expectation value corresponds to ( excitonic ) pairing of electrons and holes from different bands , the appearance of efe is directly related with the formation of an excitonic insulator ( ei ) .",
    "@xcite    the fkm with two dispersive bands , the so - called extended falicov - kimball model ( efkm ) , was studied previously for describing different properties of the ei phase .",
    "@xcite however , as it was shown for the case of opposite - parity orbitals ,  @xcite the inclusion of a finite interband hybridization can be very relevant because it removes the u(1 ) symmetry associated with the conservation of the difference between the total number of particles in each band : @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , this hybridization term is certainly relevant when the ground - state of the efkm corresponds to an excitonic condensate . for the efkm with interband hybridization ( hefkm ) , the excitonic condensate is in general replaced by ising - type phases that only break discrete symmetries of the hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    "we present a mean - field study of the influence of an explicit hybridization on the symmetry - broken states that can take place for the hefkm . to determine the ground - state quantum phase diagram of the hefkm in the strong- and weak - coupling limits of @xmath0-@xmath1 electron interaction",
    ", we assume that the interband hybridization amplitudes are small compared to the intraband hopping ( transfer ) integrals .",
    "given the nature of the discrete symmetries of the hefkm , the natural ground - state candidates are chiral phases ( chps ) and states with multipolar electric orderings .",
    "by expressing the orbital flavor as a pseudospin variable , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath7 here @xmath8 indicates that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the fermionic operators @xmath11 annihilate ( create ) an electron on the spin @xmath12 wannier orbital of the lattice site @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice has a total number of @xmath14 sites , and @xmath15 is the particle number operator for site @xmath10 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the on - site energy for each orbital , @xmath18 are the intraband hopping amplitudes , @xmath19 is the local interorbital coulomb interaction strength , and @xmath20 are the interband hybridization amplitudes , where @xmath21 for on - site hybridization and @xmath22 for intersite hybridization .",
    "the efkm is recovered from eq .   by setting @xmath23 . in this limit",
    ", the model has a continuous u(1 ) symmetry , which is removed by the inclusion of an explicit hybridization .",
    "the discrete symmetries that remain for the more general hefkm are spatial inversion and time - reversal invariance .    the pseudospin language of eq",
    ".   unveils the similarity of @xmath24 with other generic many - body hamiltonians .",
    "the efkm ( @xmath23 ) becomes an asymmetric hubbard model , i.e. , a single band model for electrons with a spin - dependent dispersion .",
    "we will still use the name `` falicov - kimball model '' to indicate that the pseudospin degree of freedom represents a physical orbital degree of freedom . from now on , we will consider that @xmath24 is defined on a square lattice and @xmath25 ( half - filled band case ) .",
    "we will also restrict to zero temperature and measure all energies in units of @xmath26 .",
    "finally , we will assume that the wannier functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are real .",
    "in the rest of the paper we will refer to the pseudospin simply as `` spin . '' the spin representation used in eq .   unveils the su(2 ) structure of this internal degree of freedom .",
    "this degree of freedom is the only one that survives at low energies in the large @xmath29 limit .",
    "consequently , the three different local or real - space order parameters correspond to the three components of the local spin variable , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the vector of the pauli matrices .",
    "more complicated ( or higher order ) real - space order parameters involve products of spin operators in more than one unit cell .",
    "a real space modulation of @xmath32 leads to _ orbital ordering_. here we will only consider the ordering wave vector @xmath33 that leads to _ staggered orbital ordering _ ( soo ) because the effective interaction is antiferromagnetic between nearest - neighbors and the lattice under consideration is bipartite .",
    "the corresponding order parameter is @xmath34    if the two orbitals have opposite parity , a nonzero @xmath35 implies the presence of a spontaneous local electric polarization that turns out to be uniform for the hefkm .",
    "this is the efe that was found in previous works for particular limits of the hefkm .",
    "@xcite the uniform electric polarization is given by @xmath36 with the interband dipole matrix element @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron charge .",
    "this phase breaks the spatial inversion symmetry of @xmath24 .    if the two orbitals have _ the same parity _",
    "( for instance @xmath39 and @xmath40 orbitals ) , a nonzero modulation of @xmath41 corresponds to an _ electric quadrupole density wave _ ( eqdw ) as long as the tensor @xmath42 is nonzero for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . in case",
    "the tensor @xmath45 [ eq .  ] vanishes , one has to look for the lowest order electric multipole that has a nonzero matrix element between the orbitals @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will assume that the tensor @xmath45 does not vanish .",
    "in second quantization , the local electric quadrupole tensor on the unit cell @xmath10 is given by the operator , @xmath48 we note that @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding quadrupolar order parameter in momentum space is given by @xmath50 again , for the hamiltonian under consideration , the wave vector of the electric quadrupolar ordering is @xmath51 .",
    "equation   implies that a nonzero modulation of the @xmath52-spin component , @xmath53 , corresponds to an eqdw .",
    "while translational symmetry is broken in this phase , time - reversal and spatial inversion symmetries are conserved .",
    "we note that the first two terms of eq .",
    "imply that orbital ordering will also lead to an eqdw .",
    "however , as it is also clear from eq .  , the quadrupolar tensors associated with the ordering along the @xmath54 and @xmath52 axes are different .",
    "the quadrupolar electric moment that is modulated under staggered orbital ordering ( staggered @xmath54 component ) corresponds to a linear combination of the tensors @xmath55 and @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the staggered ordering of the @xmath52-spin component involves a modulation of a quadrupolar electric tensor proportional to @xmath57 ( hybridization - induced quadrupolar electric moment ) . in order to simplify the notation",
    ", we will use `` eqdw '' to denote the staggered ordering of the @xmath52-spin component and soo for the the staggered ordering of the @xmath54-spin component .",
    "finally , a nonzero @xmath58 implies the spontaneous emergence of a current - density distribution between the two orbitals of the unit cell @xmath10 .  @xcite this can be easily verified if we neglect the overlap between orbitals that belong to different unit cells . in that case , the current - density operator at a point @xmath59 near @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the electron mass and the prefactor @xmath12 takes the value @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "we note that this current density flows between the two orbitals of the same unit cell ( these are atomic currents when the two orbitals belong to the same ion ) , in contrast to the orbital currents found in ref .   that flow between different unit cells .",
    "this chp breaks time - reversal symmetry and the physical order parameter is the lowest order nonzero multipole of the current - density distribution given by eq .  .",
    "the chiral ordering is _ staggered _ for orbitals with the same parity and _ uniform _ for orbitals with opposite parity .",
    "for instance , if we are considering two @xmath67 orbitals , the staggered chiral ordering of the @xmath68-spin component corresponds to orbital antiferromagnetism , because the current distribution given by eq .",
    "generates a net magnetic dipole moment .",
    "since we will consider the general case of any arbitrary pair of orbitals , we will use `` chp '' to denote the uniform ordering of the @xmath68-spin component ( same parity orbitals ) and `` staggered chiral phase '' ( schp ) to denote the staggered ordering .",
    "for the case @xmath69 , we can perform a large-@xmath19 expansion , thereby reducing the hefkm [ eq .  ( [ hefkm ] ) ] to an effective strong - coupling hamiltonian , @xmath70 , that reproduces the low - energy spectrum of the original model .    a large on - site coulomb interaction splits the spectrum of the hefkm hamiltonian into high- and low - energy parts .",
    "for @xmath71 , the lowest - energy subspace is generated by the @xmath72 states that have one electron per site .",
    "the high - energy subspaces are separated by energy gaps equal to @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of double occupied sites . for nonzero @xmath18 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the electrons are no longer completely localized at their ions , i.e. , an electron can gain kinetic energy by visiting virtually a neighboring site . since we are considering the half - filled band case ( one particle per site ) ,",
    "the low - energy effective model becomes a spin hamiltonian @xmath75 .",
    "the expression for @xmath75 up to second order in the kinetic - energy terms is @xmath76 where @xmath77 it is well known that the half - filled isotropic hubbard model can be mapped on an effective heisenberg model in the limit of a large coulomb repulsion . for the more general efkm , the intraband hopping amplitudes and the different on - site potentials lead to an effective xxz model in a magnetic field @xmath78 along the @xmath54 axis .",
    "@xmath78 is simply the energy difference between the two orbitals .  @xcite",
    "as expected , the interband hybridization of the hefkm generates anisotropic terms that explicitly break the u(1 ) invariance under uniform spin rotations about the @xmath54 axis .",
    "while the intersite hybridization leads to anisotropic exchange terms , the on - site hybridization leads to a zeeman coupling to a uniform field along the @xmath52 axis .    for low enough values of @xmath78 and no interband hybridization ,",
    "the ground - state of @xmath79 exhibits soo .",
    "the simple reason is that @xmath80 , i.e. , the effective xxz model is easy - axis .",
    "@xcite if @xmath81 is significantly larger than @xmath82 , the soo remains robust when the interband hybridization is included .",
    "clearly , there exists a critical value of @xmath78 that leads to a spin - flop transition to an ordered phase in the @xmath83 plane with a uniform component along the @xmath54 axis ( canted @xmath83 phase ) . in absence of interband hybridization",
    ", the u(1 ) invariance of the efkm implies that spin component perpendicular to the applied field can point along any direction of the @xmath83 plane . in other words",
    ", there is a continuous ground - state degeneracy that includes the eqdw ( efe ) and schp ( chp ) for orbitals with the same ( opposite ) parity . in this case",
    ", the inclusion of interband hybridization is very relevant because it lifts the continuous degeneracy and stabilizes only one of the two possible ising - type orderings ( along the @xmath52 or @xmath68 spin direction ) .    for orbitals with opposite parity",
    ", we have @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . these relationships are derived from simple symmetry considerations . in this case",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . since @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the energy is minimized by a ferromagnetic alignment of the spins along the @xmath52 direction that corresponds to an efe phase . since this was previously shown in ref .",
    ", from now on we will concentrate on the case of equal parity orbitals . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 can be nonzero if the two orbitals belong to different ions . then @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 , @xmath98 favors _ staggered _ ising - type ordering along the @xmath52 direction , while @xmath94 favors a _ uniform _ polarization along the @xmath52 direction and , consequently , a _ staggered _ ising - type ordering along the @xmath68 direction . in other words , the interband hybridization can stabilize an eqdw or a schp depending on the ratio between the on - site and intersite hybridization amplitudes .",
    "we introduce now the mean - field variational states and the corresponding energies for the three order parameters that we introduced in the previous section .",

    "again , we can see that a finite on - site hybridization @xmath94 strengthens the schp , while the intersite hybridization @xmath98 stabilizes the eqdw . within our simple mean - field approximation",
    "the boundary between these two phases is a straight line .",
    "it has been shown in ref .   that the mean - field ground - state phase diagram of the 2d efkm agrees almost perfectly with the one obtained by a constrained path monte carlo technique , even in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "this agreement motivates us to perform a hartree - fock decoupling of the hefkm to explore the quantum phase diagram for small @xmath29 .",

    ", we have @xmath33 for orbitals with the same parity and @xmath120 for orbitals with opposite parity .",
    "again , the u(1 ) invariance of the efkm ( @xmath23 ) implies that the energy does not depend on @xmath121 .",
    "consequently , there is an infinite number of ground - states with @xmath122 that results from the spontaneous u(1 ) symmetry breaking of the efkm ( excitonic condensate ) . a finite interband hybridization ( @xmath123 )",
    "removes the continuous u(1 ) symmetry and lifts the @xmath121 degeneracy of the hefkm ground - state .    for orbitals with opposite parity",
    ", the hybridization in momentum space takes the form @xmath124 and the efe state has a lower energy than the chp .",
    "this is in agreement with the result for the fkm extended by a ( small ) intersite hybridization in ref .  .",
    "therefore , from now on we will focus only on the equal parity case . the hartree - fock decoupling suggested by eq .",

    "the obtained consistency between the weak- and the strong - coupling approaches suggests that our results are robust .",
