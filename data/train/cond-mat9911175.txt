    "let us assume that at the critical value @xmath31 , for the first time , the activation energy of the interstitials becomes zero in the middle of the channel , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "this can be considered as a second order lifshitz phase transition .",
    "the interstitial electrons are indicated in fig.1 by the symbol @xmath33 .",
    "this transition is a precursor of melting of a crystal into a liquid .",
    "the existence of zero point motion defects in the middle of the channel is a nonuniform analogy of the model of supersolid proposed by a.f.andreev and i.m lifshitz in the context of quantum melting of helium crystals @xcite .",
    "such a state has never been observed in bulk helium crystals .",
    "latter it was noted @xcite that conditions for existence of such a state are less restrictive at a crystal - liquid surface , where the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of the lattice sites is larger .",
    "this leads to a quantum rough state of the surface , where zero point motion steps on the surface exist in the ground state , which , in turn , leads to the existence of surface crystallization waves at @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "crystallization waves at small @xmath11 , have been observed @xcite , while existence of solid - liquid helium quantum rough surfaces in d=3 case is still an open question @xcite . in two dimensional case",
    "the existence of quantum rough surfaces is more plausible than in the three dimensional case because the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of particles at the surface is larger .    to begin",
    ", we first consider the case when all spins are polarized in @xmath35 direction , for example , by an external magnetic field parallel to the film . in this case",
    "the interstitial s energy spectrum in the quasi - one dimensional channel has a form @xmath36 here @xmath37 is an integer corresponding to quantization of the wave function in @xmath0 direction , @xmath38 is a momentum in @xmath39 direction , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a characteristic dimension of the wave function in @xmath0 direction , @xmath42 is the effective mass of the interstitial , @xmath43 is the band width for interstitials with spin @xmath35 direction , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are interelectron distance and electron concentration in the wigner crystal respectively .",
    "band structures for interstitials moving in a polarized wigner crystal in the case @xmath46 are shown in fig.2 .    in the absence of an external magnetic field @xmath5 ,",
    "the interstitial electrons wave functions and spectrum inside the conducting channel depend crucially on the magnetic structure of the wigner crystal . the magnetic structure of a uniform wigner crystal is not known ( see a discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we will assume that the magnetic exchange energy between electrons @xmath47 has an antiferromagnetic sign and the ground state corresponds to either an antiferromagnetic state or a resonating valence bonds ( rvb ) state @xcite .",
    "we will show that in both cases the conducting channel should be ferromagnetic .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that in some range of concentrations the ferromagnetic state of the wigner crystal is also possible . in this case ,",
    "our results are valid at relatively high temperatures @xmath48 .",
    "we believe that in experiments @xcite this inequality took place because in the wigner crystal @xmath49 @xcite .    it has been known for a long time @xcite that a point defect embedded in a uniform antiferromagnetic quantum crystal",
    "is surrounded by a ferromagnetic region with a radius @xmath50 we assume that @xmath51 .",
    "the reason for the existence of the magnetic polaron is that @xmath43 is much larger than the energy band width of the defect embedded in an antiferromagnetic crystal .",
    "a competition between negative delocalization energy of the point defect inside the ferromagnetic polaron ( of order of @xmath52 ) and the positive spin polarization energy of the magnetic polaron , ( of order of @xmath53 ) leads to eq.3 .    if @xmath54 one should substitute @xmath47 with @xmath11 in eq.3 .",
    "thus there are two characteristic lengths in the problem , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath57 when the magnetic polarons have sizes @xmath56 and @xmath55 in @xmath39 and @xmath0 direction respectively .",
    "if @xmath58 , the one - dimensional concentration of the interstitial electrons in the channel , is small ( @xmath59 ) , the magnetic polarons do not overlap ; the magnetization @xmath60 is nonuniform ; the channel conducts poorly and the conductance of the channel increases gradually with @xmath58 ( or with @xmath6 ) . at @xmath61 , the magnetic polarons overlap and",
    "form a conducting magnetically polarized channel .",
    "the width of the magnetically polarized region in this case is of order of @xmath55 . at this point",
    "the concentration of interstitials in the channel is small and , due to exchange spin splitting , they have spins @xmath35 .",
    "the conductance of the channel exhibits the first plateau at @xmath62 .",
    "the situation arising at a high concentration of interstitials @xmath58 depends on a ratio between @xmath63 and @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath64 , further increasing of @xmath58 will lead to filling of the band @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath66 , the kinetic energy of interstitials with spins @xmath67 is small ( see fig.2 ) . here",
    "@xmath68 is the width of the band with @xmath65 .",
    "the width of the magnetic stripe does not increase as the band @xmath65 is being filled and interstitials in the band @xmath65 move in the uniform exchange potential associated with the uniform magnetization @xmath69 inside the channel .",
    "therefore the conductance exhibits the second plateau at @xmath70 , which is not smeared .    at last ,",
    "let us discuss the temperature dependence of the first plateau , which corresponds to the band @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that @xmath72 and @xmath73 is small and , consequently , the interstitial activation energy @xmath74 is also small .",
    "in this situation interstitials thermally activated in the channel increase the magnetic moment @xmath75 and make the distribution of @xmath76 more uniform . as a result , the first plateau at @xmath77 becomes stronger as temperature increases . since @xmath78 is small , one can neglect thermal fluctuations of the wigner crystal lattice .",
    "this is different from solid @xmath79 case where the activation energy of point defects is large .",
    "therefore the crystal melts before point defects contribute significantly to magnetic properties of the sample .",
    "the presented above model explains the following experimental facts .",
    "a).it predicts the ferromagnetic ground state of the conducting channel and the existence of an additional step in the @xmath80-dependence @xmath81 , h=0 ) at @xmath82 .",
    "b).it predicts that the first plateau in the @xmath80-dependence of @xmath13 is more smeared than the second one .",
    "c).it explains why the first plateau at @xmath77 becomes stronger as @xmath11 increases .",
    "d).it also follows from the presented above picture that at small concentration of electrons in the channel when @xmath83 , and at small @xmath11 , the system should exhibit giant negative magnetoresistance in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "this is because the radius of the magnetic polaron @xmath84 increases with @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , this effect takes place also in the variable range hopping regime @xcite .    at last ,",
    "let us mention difficulties of the presented above model .    1 ) .",
    "experimental data @xcite exhibit the plateau at @xmath85 .",
    "it is not clear to us whether it is possible to attribute the difference between @xmath85 and @xmath16 to smearing of the first plateau .    2 ) .",
    "there are experimental indications that the first and the third plateau disappear at @xmath34 @xcite . to this end",
    ", we would like to mention that the filling of the first band , as @xmath6 changes , is a complicated process which involves overlapping of the magnetic polarons . therefore ,",
    "even in the approximation when there is no direct interaction between the interstitials , there is an indirect long range many - body effective interaction between the interstitials , which is mediated by spin degrees of freedom of the wigner crystal . as a result ,",
    "if @xmath58 is fixed , the spatial phase separation of the interstitials takes place at relatively small @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "recently this phenomenon has been reconsidered in the context of htc @xcite .",
    "the apparent differences between @xcite and the situation discussed here are : a)the interstitials are neutral objects because they are screened by wigner crystal lattice and b ) in experiments it is the chemical potential rather than @xmath58 that is fixed . the latter means that at @xmath34 there is no phase separation .",
    "instead , @xmath86 dependence exhibits a jump from zero to a finite value of the interstitial concentration @xmath87 .",
    "the final state of the conducting channel in this case is uniform .",
    "as it is usual for first order phase transitions , the states with @xmath88 and @xmath89 are separated by an energy barrier .",
    "thus , the formation of the conducting channel is a collective phenomenon which involves tunneling of many electrons into the channel .",
    "therefore , at this point , we can not rule out a possibility that the @xmath90 dependence is hysteretic and that the experimental results depend on the history of the temperature , the magnetic field and the gate voltage .    3 ) . in the approximation of noninteracting interstitials and at @xmath91",
    "the band @xmath65 will be completely filled before the the chemical potential reaches the top of the band @xmath71 .",
    "this would lead to reentrance from the plateau at @xmath92 to the plateau at @xmath62 as @xmath58 increases .",
    "it is worth emphasising , however , that the presented above consideration is of a single particle nature .",
    "it neglects interstitial - interstitial and interstitial - wigner crystal lattice interactions and requires detailed knowledge of interstitials band structures at relatively high interstitial energies .",
    "in experimental situation , @xmath93 is not such a big number and the interaction effects could be very important at large @xmath58 . in particular , the quasiparticle s bandwidth could depend on @xmath58 .",
    "some of these difficulties may be resolved if we consider the opposite limit @xmath94 . in this case",
    "@xmath95 levels with spin @xmath35 should be filled before the chemical potential of interstitials reaches the band @xmath65 .",
    "therefore the conductance is quantized in unit @xmath16 and plateaus in @xmath13 follow in a proper sequence .",
    "it is also plausible that the first plateau becomes stronger as @xmath11 increases .",
    "it is not clear , however , why in the framework of this picture the third plateau at @xmath96 should be more smeared than the second one at @xmath8 .    in principle",
    ", it would be possible to distinguish @xmath46 and @xmath97 cases by different @xmath98 dependences . here",
    "@xmath99 are the gate voltages at which the chemical potential reaches the bottom of the @xmath100 band and a new plateau occurs . in the case @xmath91 , the gate voltages @xmath101 and @xmath102 correspond to bottoms of @xmath71 and @xmath65 bands .",
    "therefore they move in the opposite directions as @xmath1 increases . in the case",
    "@xmath103 , gate voltages @xmath101 and @xmath102 correspond to bottoms of @xmath104 and @xmath105 bands and they move in the same direction as @xmath1 increases . in experiments",
    "@xcite , @xmath101 and @xmath102 move in the same direction .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether this can also be explained as an orbital magnetic field effect which exists due to a finite width of the two dimensional electron gas @xcite .",
    "in a uniform situation , the two - dimensional wigner crystal melting is believed to be a first order phase transition , which occurs at a critical electron concentration @xmath106 . in a nonuniform case shown in fig.1",
    ", a classical picture would predict that the transition takes place at a larger concentration of electrons in the middle of the channel @xmath107 because of existence of the crystal - liquid surface energy .",
    "the width of the conducting channel at the point of transition is @xmath108 .",
    "here @xmath109}{\\partial n}|_{n = n_{c}}$ ] , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are energy densities of 2d fermi liquid and wigner crystal respectively , and @xmath112 is the surface energy per unit length .",
    "now consider a situation when the width @xmath113 is large and the concentration of electrons in the channel is high . in this case",
    "we can view the system as a stripe of fermi liquid sandwiched between two antiferromagnetic ( or rvb ) wigner crystal ( see fig.3a ) .",
    "it has been pointed out in the context of solid - liquid @xmath79 interface @xcite that the ferromagnetic ordering is a generic property of a quantum rough surface .",
    "it originates from the competition between kinetic energy of defects on the surface and the antiferromagnetic exchange energy in the bulk of crystal .",
    "since it is not known whether the wigner crystal - fermi liquid surface is in a quantum smooth or in a quantum rough state , we will consider the case of a quantum smooth boundary , which is less favorable for the ferromagnetism , and present a model which exhibits boundary ferromagnetism even in this case .",
    "we will model the system with the help of the hubbard hamiltonian defined on a semi - infinite two - dimensional square lattice shown in fig.3a .",
    "@xmath114 here @xmath115 labels adjacent sites on a square lattice , @xmath116 are annihilation and creation electron operators on a site @xmath117 , @xmath118 is a spin index labeling @xmath67 and @xmath35 directions of electron spins , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are parameters which describe intersite tunneling and intrasite electron repulsion respectively . in the case of half - filling and at @xmath121 ,",
    "the hamiltonian describes a mott insulator , which is an analog of the wigner crystal .",
    "the spin ground state of the system is antiferromagnetic ( or rvb ) with exchange energy of order @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "we will describe the semi - infinite two - dimensional fermi - liquid with the help of the hamiltonian for noninteracting electrons @xmath123 , where @xmath124 , @xmath125 are annihilation and creation electron operators in the liquid , @xmath126 is the electron energy , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the momentum and mass respectively , @xmath129 is the liquid s fermi energy .",
    "the tunneling between the mott insulator and the fermi liquid is described by the hamiltonian @xmath130 here index @xmath131 labels the localized states in the insulator at the boundary .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath132 . in the case of half filling ,",
    "the chemical potential of the mott insulator lies in the middle of the gap between the valence and the conduction band ( see fig.3b ) . for a wigner crystal ,",
    "it means that the energy of creation of a vacancy and an interstitial electron would be the same . in general",
    ", there is no reason to expect such a symmetry in a real wigner crystal .",
    "therefore we introduce into the model a small concentration of impurity levels , which pin the position of the chemical potential below ( or above ) the middle of the gap .",
    "these impurities are marked by symbols `` @xmath133 '' in fig.3b .",
    "the distance between the impurities will be much larger than all other characteristic lengths in the problem . to be concrete",
    "we consider the situation when the chemical potential is pinned near the bottom of the valence band and the energy for transferring an electron into the liquid and creation of a vacancy in the mott insulator is @xmath134 ( see fig.3b ) .",
    "the tunneling between the liquid and the mott insulator leads to a negative correction to the ground state energy of the system .",
    "the value of the correction depends on the spin configuration in the mott insulator . in the second order perturbation theory with respect to @xmath135",
    ", we have an expression for the correction to the energy per unit surface length @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the lattice spacing , @xmath138 is the energy of a vacancy moving in a spin configuration @xmath139 in mott insulator , @xmath140 labels the vacancy eigenfunctions in the mott insulator and @xmath141 is the sample length in y direction .",
    "suppose that in the mott insulator near the surface there is a ferromagnetic region of the width @xmath142 ( see fig.3a ) .",
    "then we can estimate @xmath143 . here",
    "@xmath144 is the vacancy energy bandwidth in a completely spin polarized mott insulator , @xmath145 is an integer corresponding to quantized motion of the vacancy in @xmath0-direction , @xmath38 is the quasi - momentum of the vacancy in @xmath146 direction ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "we assume that in the case of the antiferromagnetic ordering the bandwidth of the vacancy is small and it is almost localized .",
    "expanding eq.6 with respect to @xmath148 and taking into account the energy of the spin polarization in the stripe of the width @xmath142 , we get an estimate for spin configuration dependent part of the ground state energy @xmath149 eq.7 has a minimum at @xmath150 therefore the system is magnetically polarized at the surface provided @xmath151 .    the statement about existence of the magnetic polarization near the surface can be proved in a more rigorous way starting with usual perturbation theory @xmath152 here @xmath153 labels the lattice sites at the boundary , @xmath154 labels paths of a vacancy on the lattice intersecting the boundary at sites @xmath117 and @xmath131 , which preserve an initial spin configuration of the system ( an example of such a path is shown in fig.3a ) , @xmath155 is a function of the distance between sites @xmath117 and @xmath131 , which reflects the friedel oscillations in the fermi liquid , @xmath156 is the number of steps a vacancy hops along a path @xmath157 . while obtaining eq.9 from eqs.4,5 , we neglected all terms which involve double electron occupancies of lattice sites .",
    "the factor @xmath158 depends on the spin configuration in the system . in the ferromagnetic case , due to fermi statistics of electrons , it is equal to @xmath159 . in the limit @xmath160 , @xmath161 and",
    "we only need to take into account paths which enter and leave the mott insulator through the same lattice site @xmath162 . at this point",
    "the problem is reduced to that considered in @xcite , where it was proven that the ground state of the system with one vacancy and infinite @xmath120 is ferromagnetic .",
    "a resummation of these ferromagnetic paths leads to eq.6 .",
    "the presented above picture is relevant when the width @xmath113 of the fermi liquid stripe is large , which corresponds to large @xmath17 in eq.1 . strictly speaking , in this case ,",
    "each plateau with given @xmath17 also splits into two plateaus quantized in unit @xmath16 .",
    "however , the amplitude of this splitting of plateaus should be small .",
    "let us consider what happens as concentration of electrons in the channel and , consequently , @xmath113 decreases .",
    "it has been mentioned above that the mean field theory , which neglects quantum fluctuations of the position of the crystal - fermi liquid boundary , predicts the creation of the conducting channel as a first order phase transition .",
    "the question arises whether quantum fluctuations of electron positions in the wigner crystal can make this transition to be a second order one .",
    "the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of the position of the crystal - liquid boundary depends on whether the surface is in a quantum rough or a quantum smooth state .",
    "if it is in a quantum rough state , we can describe deviations of the boundary from its equilibrium classical position by a variable @xmath163 and use the following effective action @xmath164\\ ] ] to estimate the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of the position of the boundary . here",
    "@xmath165 corresponds to the energy difference between the solid and liquid phase as the boundary is moved by distance @xmath166 , @xmath167 .",
    "the second term in eq.10 corresponds to the surface tension and the first term corresponds to acceleration of steps along the surface .",
    "we would like to mention that the situation described by eq.10 is different from that considered in @xcite .",
    "the electron density profile @xmath168 in the channel is determined by the long range coulomb force .",
    "therefore , in our case there is no redistribution of the electron density in the liquid associated with oscillations @xmath163 . using eq.10 we get an estimate @xmath169 . here",
    "the brackets @xmath170 stand for the quantum mechanical averaging .",
    "if @xmath171 , then the one - dimensional melting can occur as a second order phase transition and we arrive at the picture considered in the previous section .",
    "we believe that , in principle , this inequality can take place because the transition occurs at @xmath172 where at short distances the crystal differs from the liquid very little .",
    "in conclusion we would like to make the following remarks . at finite temperature the ferromagnetic ordering of the quasi - one dimensional stripe",
    "will be destroyed by thermal fluctuations .",
    "strictly speaking , at @xmath34 , the presented above arguments only prove existence of strong ferromagnetic correlations at `` small '' distances . at this stage",
    "we can not rule out a possibility that at `` large '' distances the ferromagnetism will be destroyed by quantum fluctuations of spin configuration in a 2-d wigner crystal .",
    "quantization of the conductance of the channel in units @xmath16 , however , persists as long as the length of the channel is shorter than the characteristic distance of the destruction of the ferromagnetism .    it has been shown @xcite that the ground state of strictly one - dimensional systems can not be ferromagnetic . however , in the experiment @xcite the system is not strictly one - dimensional .",
    "we are unaware of any theorem which prevents existence of ferromagnetism in quasi - one - dimensional system of the type shown in fig.3 .",
    "we leave this questions for future investigation .",
