    "dynamics of a system of inelastically colliding hard spheres have attracted a great deal of recent interest @xcite , in particular in the context of validity of kinetic theory and hydrodynamics of rapid granular flow developed in the 80-ies @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics looks ideally suitable for a description of large - scale patterns observed in rapid granular flows : a plethora of clustering phenomena @xcite , vortices @xcite , oscillons @xcite , shocks @xcite , etc .",
    ", that are difficult to understand in the language of individual particles . however , a first - principle derivation of a universally applicable continuum theory of granular gas is not a simple task , even in the dilute limit .",
    "the use of the enskog equation , the starting point of a systematic derivation of the constitutive relations of granular hydrodynamics , is based on the _ molecular chaos _ hypothesis .",
    "this hypothesis is justified for not too large densities and for an ensemble of _ elastic _ hard spheres .",
    "its use for _ inelastic _ hard spheres is not obvious , as inelasticity of the particle collisions introduces inter - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "the correlations become stronger as the inelasticity of the collisions increases . on the contrary , for _",
    "nearly elastic _ collisions , @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the coefficient of normal restitution ) the correlations are small , and the enskog equation can be safely used .",
    "an important additional assumption , made in the process of the derivation of hydrodynamics from the enskog equation , is scale separation .",
    "hydrodynamics demands that the mean free path of the particles be much less than any characteristic length scale , and the mean time between two consecutive collisions be much less than any characteristic time scale described hydrodynamically .",
    "this condition should be verified , in every specific system , after the hydrodynamic problem is solved and the characteristic length and time scales determined .",
    "again , it is safe to say that this condition can be satisfied if the particle collisions are nearly elastic @xcite .",
    "restrictive as it is , the nearly elastic limit is conceptually important just because granular hydrodynamics is expected to work here .",
    "another potentially important , albeit largely unexplored , limitation of the validity of granular hydrodynamics ( or , rather , of any continuum approach to rapid granular flow ) is due to the noise caused by the discrete nature of particles .",
    "noise is stronger here than in classical ( molecular ) fluids simply because the number of particles is much smaller .",
    "in addition , noise can be amplified at thresholds of hydrodynamic instabilities as found , for example , in rayleigh - bnard convection of classical fluids @xcite .",
    "the validity of hydrodynamic description in general , and the accuracy of constitutive relations in particular , can be conveniently checked on symmetry - breaking instabilities that are abundant in rapid granular flows .",
    "the example of a symmetry - breaking instability that we consider in this work deals with a very simple setting : a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of nearly elastically colliding hard spheres , confined by a rectangular box and driven by a thermal sidewall at zero gravity .",
    "the setting is described in detail in sec .",
    "the basic steady state here is the `` stripe state '' : a stripe of enhanced density at the wall opposite to the driving wall @xcite . in the continuum language , the stripe state is uniform in the lateral direction , by which we mean the direction parallel to the driving wall . within a certain range of parameters ( delineated below ) ,",
    "steady - state equations of granular hydrodynamics predict spontaneous symmetry breaking instability of the stripe state , when the aspect ratio of the confining box exceeds a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "the instability leads to phase separation : the development of `` droplets '' ( high - density domains ) coexisting with `` bubbles '' ( low - density domains ) . for _ very _ large aspect ratios of the box ,",
    "this symmetry - breaking instability has been recently observed in event - driven molecular dynamic ( emd ) simulations , and described by a phenomenological continuum model @xcite . the present work is devoted to a more detailed investigation of the phase separation instability in the range of aspect ratios _ comparable _ to the threshold value .",
    "we employ , in sec .",
    "iii , the equations of granular hydrodynamics ( or rather hydrostatics ) to compute the supercritical bifurcation curve for the phase separation instability . then we report , in section iv , on extensive emd simulations that show that this bifurcation curve is quantitatively accurate _",
    "well _ below and _ well _ above the threshold value of the aspect ratio .",
    "unexpectedly , the hydrostatic theory fails in a relatively _ wide _ region of aspect ratios around the threshold value , where the system is found to exhibit giant fluctuations . in an attempt to get insight into the mechanism of this anomaly , we investigate , also in section iv , the dependence of the magnitude of fluctuations on the total number of particles in the system .",

    "the fourth , thermal wall is located at @xmath6 . upon collision with it , the normal component of the particle velocity is drawn from a maxwell distribution with temperature @xmath7 @xcite , while the tangential component of the particle velocity is preserved .",
    "working in the nearly elastic limit @xmath0 and employing the navier - stokes hydrodynamics @xcite , we introduce the number density @xmath8 , granular temperature @xmath9 and mean - flow velocity @xmath10 .",
    "energy input at the thermal wall can be balanced by the dissipation due to inter - particle collisions .",
    "therefore , we assume that the system reaches a zero - mean - flow steady state @xmath11 , and is therefore describable by the simple momentum and energy balance equations : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the pressure , @xmath14 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath15 is the rate of energy loss by collisions .",

    "6 ) .    to better characterize the fluctuation - dominated region",
    ", we computed the probability distribution function @xmath116 of different values of @xmath117 in a statistical steady state , that is , after transients die out .",
    "the stationarity of the remaining data was tested by dividing the respective time interval into three sub - intervals and checking that the differences in @xmath116 for the sub - intervals are small and not systematic .",

    "the maximum of @xmath116 is at @xmath119 , and it is relatively narrow . correspondingly , there is no symmetry breaking there , the fluctuations are relatively small , and the hydrostatic theory yields an accurate leading - order description . at @xmath120 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath116 is at a non - zero @xmath117 .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of symmetry - breaking : a dense cluster develops in one of the corners away from the driving wall .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath116 is also quite narrow here , the fluctuations are relatively small , and there is a good agreement between the hydrostatic theory and emd - simulations . on the contrary , in a wide region of @xmath37 around @xmath92 ,",
    "the probability distribution @xmath116 is very broad , and the hydrostatic theory breaks down . by following the position of the maximum of @xmath116 at different @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , one can see that the symmetry - breaking transition occurs somewhere in the region of @xmath121 .",
    "because of the extreme flatness and broadness of the probability distribution @xmath116 in this region , a more accurate estimate of the position of the maximum of @xmath116 requires a much better statistics ( that is , a much longer simulation time ) than we could afford in this series of simulations @xcite .",
    "noticeable in fig .",
    "6 is a systematic discrepancy , within the wide fluctuation - dominated region , between the positions of the maxima of @xmath116 and the hydrostatic bifurcation curve computed in sec .",
    "we even can not exclude a change in the character of bifurcation caused by the fluctuations ( apparently without shifting the bifurcation point ) .",
    "indeed , the maxima of @xmath116 at @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 appear to lie on a straight line passing through the theoretical transition point @xmath125 .",
    "as @xmath37 increases further , the discrepancy between the positions of the maxima of @xmath116 and the theoretical bifurcation curve goes down @xcite .",
    "importantly , the fluctuation - dominated region @xmath121 does include the hydrostatic transition point @xmath126 .",
    "we should stress that the failure of hydrostatics is observed at _ intermediate _ values of the aspect ratio @xmath37 , when the hydrodynamic parameters @xmath36 and @xmath35 , and the number of particles @xmath2 , are fixed . in view of eq .",
    "( [ restitution ] ) , while increasing @xmath37 , one increases the inelasticity of particle collisions @xmath19 . that the hydrostatic theory fails at intermediate values of the inelasticity , and improves at small enough , or large enough inelasticities , excludes the inelasticity itself as the reason for the failure .",
    "we did a series of simulations with different number of particles @xmath2 in order to verify the hydrodynamic scaling and investigate the @xmath2-dependence of the ( relatively weak ) fluctuations well below and well above @xmath92 .",
    "these additional simulations were done for @xmath127 and three values of @xmath2 : @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and for @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "when varying @xmath2 at fixed @xmath37 , we kept the hydrodynamic parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 constant .",
    "therefore , if the hydrostatic equations provide a correct leading - order theory of the steady states far below and far above @xmath92 , the time - averaged steady state values of @xmath77 should become @xmath2-independent for large enough @xmath2 .",
    "figure  7 shows @xmath77 versus time for @xmath127 at the four different values of @xmath2 .",
    "one can see that , in all these cases , the average value of @xmath77 is close to zero as expected , while fluctuations are relatively small .",
    "figure  8 shows the dynamics of @xmath110 for @xmath94 and two different values of @xmath2 : @xmath133 and @xmath134 . here",
    "the symmetry - breaking is evident , as a dense cluster develops in a corner . with a moderate accuracy determined by the relatively high level of fluctuations of @xmath77 , the average values of @xmath77 at late times are close to each other . therefore , well below and well above @xmath92 the hydrodynamic scaling is obeyed .    simulations with fixed scaled parameters @xmath36 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 , but different @xmath2 can also help in identifying the mechanism of breakdown of the hydrostatic theory at aspect ratios around @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , it is natural to interpret the giant oscillations , shown in fig .",
    "4c - e , in terms of a strong coupling between the two bifurcated states predicted by the hydrostatic theory .",
    "one possible scenario of this coupling ( which we call scenario i ) relies on the discrete - particle noise , unaccounted for by granular hydrodynamics .",
    "@xmath92 , the discrete - particle noise is expected to cause fluctuations , that is to broaden the distribution of @xmath77 as indeed observed in fig .",
    "if scenario i is correct , the standard deviation @xmath135 of @xmath109 from its average value should vanish as @xmath2 goes to infinity , at fixed hydrodynamic parameters @xmath36 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "another possibility ( scenario ii ) is that the fluctuations persist in the limit of @xmath136 .",
    "if this is the case , the dominating mechanism of fluctuations has a purely hydrodynamic nature and should be explainable by a _ full _ hydrodynamic analysis ( as opposed to our hydrostatic analysis , and to the simplified hydrodynamic simulations that used a model stokes friction instead of the full viscosity ) . here",
    "the coupling between the two symmetry - broken states may be due to either an unstable hydrodynamic mode ( scenario iia ) , or a weakly damped mode ( scenario iib ) . in scenario",
    "iib , @xmath135 should vanish , as @xmath137 , if one waits for a sufficiently long time . therefore , to distinguish between the two sub - scenarios , one should , in addition to the limit of @xmath136 , take the limit of @xmath138 .    obviously , one is unable to take any of these two limits in actual emd simulations , where the maximum achievable values of @xmath2 and @xmath139 are limited by the available computer resources .",
    "so what was observed in our emd simulations with different @xmath2 ? figures  7 and 9 show what happens well below @xmath92 , when @xmath2 increases from @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "7 that , as @xmath2 grows , the high - frequency components of the fluctuations do decrease , but the low frequency component does not show any pronounced decrease .",
    "overall , the fluctuation spectrum moves towards the lower frequencies . as the result ,",
    "a good resolution of the low - frequency part of the power spectrum requires longer and longer simulations ( which rapidly become prohibitively long ) .",
    "this introduces an additional , non - trivial constraint on simulations with a large number of particles .",
    "a similar situation occurs well above @xmath92 .",
    "figure  8 does indicate that @xmath135 goes down as @xmath2 goes up from @xmath141 to @xmath142 .",
    "however , one also observes that , as @xmath2 grows , the role of the low - frequency components of the fluctuations increases .",
    "hydrodynamics provides a hint for the mechanism of the  red shift \" of the power spectrum with an increase of @xmath2 .",
    "there are four hydrodynamic modes in the system : two acoustic modes , the entropy mode and the shear mode .",
    "the frequencies of the acoustic modes are the highest , as they are determined by the  ideal \" ( non - dissipative ) terms in the hydrodynamic equations , and they scale like the inverse system size .",
    "the frequencies of the entropy and shear modes are much lower , as they are determined by the transport coefficients : the heat conduction , viscosity and inelastic loss rate , and they scale like the inverse _ square _ of the system size . in the units of @xmath143 , and at fixed hydrodynamic parameters @xmath36 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 , a larger",
    "@xmath2 implies a larger system , see eqs .",
    "( [ dimensions ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , as @xmath2 increases , the characteristic frequencies of the entropy / shear modes go down much faster than those of the acoustic modes .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that one of these modes is responsible for the low - frequency components of the fluctuations .",
    "a related issue is that , in contrast to the hydrostatic problem ( [ energy1 ] ) , the full time - dependent hydrodynamic problem has an additional scaled parameter : @xmath144 .",
    "this parameter describes the role of the dissipative terms compared to the  ideal \" terms in the hydrodynamic equations . as it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ dimensions ] ) , when increasing @xmath2 at constant @xmath36 and @xmath35 , one reduces this additional parameter . therefore , as @xmath2 increases",
    ", the low - frequency shear / entropy modes should become more and more persistent .",
    "as these modes are not necessarily broad - band , @xmath135 might cease to provide a good characterization of the system at large @xmath2 .",
    "still , if one continues following @xmath135 as @xmath2 increases , one observes ( see fig .",
    "9 ) that @xmath135 decreases much slower than the classic dependence @xmath145 characteristic of equilibrium systems .",
    "if one attempts to interpret the decrease of @xmath135 with an increase of @xmath2 in terms of an empiric power law , one obtains an exponent @xmath146 , instead of the classical value of @xmath147 for equilibrium systems .",
    "importantly , we did reproduce the classical @xmath145 scaling of @xmath135 in a control series of simulations with the same @xmath35 and @xmath37 , but with @xmath148 ( elastic collisions ) .",
    "moreover , a good quantitative agreement was obtained with a theoretical result for @xmath135 that directly follows from the classic expression for the density correlation function in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we also found that , for the same total number of particles @xmath2 , the fluctuation levels in the elastic case are significantly lower than in the inelastic case .",
    "that is , well below @xmath92 , the fluctuations , though much smaller than those observed for @xmath112 , are still large compared to the elastic case .    to summarize this subsection ,",
    "our simulations with different @xmath2 strongly indicate that the hydrostatic equations provide a correct leading order theory of this system well below and well above @xmath92 .",
    "on the other hand , the simulations proved to be insufficient for determining the mechanism of giant fluctuations that we observed in this system at @xmath112 .",
    "we can not even be sure at this point whether the fluctuations ( or , more precisely , their low - frequency components ) persist or not as @xmath149 .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarized in the following way .",
    "granular hydrostatics , in combination with simplified hydrodynamic simulations , correctly predict the phase separation instability in this prototypical driven granular system .",
    "well above and well below the critical value of the aspect ratio @xmath92 , the hydrostatic theory describes the steady state of the system well .",
    "however , in a wide region of aspect ratios around @xmath92 the system is dominated by fluctuations , and the hydrostatic theory fails .",
    "the fluctuation levels are anomalously high even relatively far from the hydrostatic bifurcation point , and they certainly do not exhibit the classic @xmath145 scaling with the number of particles @xmath2 .    though we are unable to pinpoint the mechanism of excitation of the giant fluctuations , we can suggest two different scenarios for their origin . in scenario",
    "i the fluctuations are driven by discrete particle noise .",
    "indeed , it is well known that discrete particle noise can drive relatively large fluctuations in the vicinity of thresholds of hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite and non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of this type should vanish as one increases indefinitely the number of particles in the system , keeping the hydrodynamic parameters constant .",
    "unfortunately , our simulations with different @xmath2 , but fixed @xmath36 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 , have been insufficient to prove or disprove this scenario .    a difficulty with scenario i is that the fluctuations are so big in so wide a region of aspect ratios . no anomaly of this type has been observed in any other symmetry - breaking instability of granular flow , even with much smaller numbers of particles . as an example , let us consider for a moment the same system , but introduce gravity in the @xmath108 direction .",
    "now the granular gas is heated from below , and the system exhibits _ another _ symmetry - breaking instability : thermal convection , similar to the rayleigh - bnard convection of classical fluids .",
    "the transition to convection occurs via a supercritical bifurcation @xcite . though emd simulations of thermal granular convection @xcite involved only @xmath150 particles ( which is much less than @xmath151 used in the present work ) , a _ sharp _",
    "supercritical bifurcation was observed , in agreement with a hydrodynamic analysis @xcite . by comparison ,",
    "the giant fluctuations , observed in a wide region of @xmath37 in the present work , are an anomaly , as one needs some ( hydrodynamic ? ) mechanism of strong _ amplification _ of the discrete - particle noise .",
    "if scenario i proves to be correct , the corresponding theory can be developed in the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite , generalized to granular gases in the limit of nearly elastic collsions .",
    "fluctuating hydrodynamics is a langevin - type theory that takes into account the discrete character of particles by adding delta - correlated noise terms in the momentum and energy equations @xcite .",
    "fluctuating hydrodynamics is by now well established for classical fluids in 3d , including non - equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "we should mention here that the 2d case has an additional difficulty .",
    "the coupling of fluctuations here is anomalously strong , even in the elastic case : the transport coefficients diverge in the thermodynamic limit , except for a sufficiently dilute gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can hope to generalize the fluctuating hydrodynamics to the 2d gas of inelastic hard spheres in the dilute limit @xcite .",
    "close to the phase separation threshold , the dilute limit holds with a reasonable accuracy",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the phase separation problem in 3d , where important differences in the fluctuation behavior may occur .",
    "alternatively , in scenario ii the low - frequency component of the giant fluctuations has a purely hydrodynamic origin and is driven either by a presently unknown hydrodynamic instability ( scenario iia ) , or by a long - lived transient mode ( scenario iib ) .",
    "effects of these type are obviously missed by a _",
    "hydrostatic _ analysis .",
    "they may have also been missed by the time - dependent hydrodynamic simulation @xcite that employed a model stokes friction , rather than the hard - sphere viscosity , to accelerate the convergence to a steady state .",
    "if scenario ii is correct , the low - frequency component of the fluctuations should be observable in hydrodynamic simulations with the true hard - sphere viscosity .",
    "these simulations , therefore , should be an important next step in the analysis of this fascinating problem .",
    "we are very grateful to e. livne for doing the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "we thank a. barrat , i. goldhirsch and e. khain for useful discussions .",
