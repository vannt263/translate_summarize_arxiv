    "during the decade following the first string revolution , the focus of string phenomenology was two - fold : development of methods for constructing consistent string models with compactified dimensions and searching within the domain of each construction method for those models with at least _ quasi - realistic _",
    "phenomenology @xcite .",
    "many three generation string models were found within a few years .",
    "the dominant view back then was that discovery of the true string vacuum ( model ) was within reach  that the string  e needle \" would eventually be found within the stringstack of but a few trillion vacua",
    ". eventually a handful of quite realistic mssm or near - mmsm three generation models were indeed found @xcite , especially following the first _ minimal standard heterotic string model _ @xcite .    however , following the second string revolution the rise of @xmath4-theory has taught string phenomenologists the likely impossibility of finding a  true \" string vacuum somewhere on the string / m - landscape composed of _ at least _",
    "@xmath5 vacua .",
    "in addition to vast number of vacua , all vacua now appear to be on equal footing .",
    "thus , the phenomenological goal has shifted from studying individual string models to better understanding statistically the characteristics of the string / m - models on the landscape , or at least within specific domains @xcite .",
    "the ( often overlapping ) domains on the landscape frequently correspond to model construction methods .",
    "one construction method that has been widely explored in terms of individual models and for which large scale statistical studies are underway is free fermions @xcite .",
    "the free fermionic heterotic string has provided many quasi - realistic ( near-)mssm - like models @xcite , ( semi- ) gut models @xcite , and gut models @xcite . in the context of the second string revolution",
    ", we should now proceed to determine overall pheonenological patterns within these and the many more , as yet undiscovered , free fermionic models .",
    "therefore , let us review the free fermionic approach as a means of developing a _ systematic _ method of generating models in vast numbers from which the statistics of phenomenological properties may be developed .",
    "the first object required to specify a model in the free fermionic heterotic string @xcite is a set @xmath6^{64}| i \\in \\{1, ... ,l\\in \\mathbb{n}\\}\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where components @xmath7 , @xmath8 are boundary conditions for real worldsheet free fermion degrees of freedom of the left - moving supersymmetric string , and @xmath7 for @xmath9 are boundary conditions for real worldsheet free fermion degrees of freedom on the right moving bosonic string . in the @xmath10 basis ( complex fermions ) , each component of @xmath11 is double counted , and @xmath11 is a @xmath12 @xmath13 component vector ( which can be generalized to include left - right paired real fermions ) .    the order @xmath14 of a given @xmath11 is defined as as in set theory , in contrast to its general exclusion in number theory . ]",
    "@xmath15 with @xmath16 thus , each component of an @xmath17 of order @xmath18 is of the form @xmath19    modular invariance demands @xmath20 @xmath21 in the @xmath10 basis @xcite . , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , including cases where @xmath24 may be identical .",
    "however , this requirement is automatically satisfied by gauge sector basis vectors of the form discussed herein , so this contraint will not be discussed more in this paper . ] one additional requirement is that each model contain @xmath25 , the 64 real - component vector with every element equal to one .    in a given free fermionic model ,",
    "the different sectors of a model are formed by all linear combinations of the @xmath11 s with coefficients @xmath26 where each coefficient @xmath27 . each linear combination , or sector , is denoted @xmath28 we can ( and will ) think of each set of coefficients @xmath29 as an l - dimensional vector in @xmath30 , whose @xmath31 component is constrained by the order of @xmath11 .    for a given sector @xmath32 , a worldsheet fermion @xmath33 transforms as @xmath34 around non - contractible loops on the worldsheet .",
    "thus , for @xmath35 fermions , @xmath36 must be either 0 or 1 , whereas for @xmath10 fermions , @xmath36 must be rational .    for each sector , we can form the @xmath37 charges for the cartan generators of the unbroken gauge groups ( which are in one to one correspondence with the @xmath37 currents @xmath38 for each complex fermion @xmath33 ) ; @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a fermion number operator which counts each mode of @xmath33 once and of @xmath41 minus once . or , in other words , @xmath42 .",
    "the second object required to specify a model in the free fermionic heterotic string is an @xmath43 matrix @xmath44 .",
    "modular invariance imposes the following constraints on @xmath44 ; @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the 4 dimensional spacetime component of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , we demand @xmath49 $ ] .    in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the ( massless ) gauge sectors , so we will assume @xmath48=0 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 in everything that follows .",
    "furthermore , we can express the masses of physical states as functions of the charges ; @xmath52 @xmath53 we have already demanded that @xmath54 above .",
    "so , to make @xmath55 , we demand @xmath56    now , the gso projection constraint is ; @xmath57 with @xmath58 in our models .",
    "the formulation described in section [ sec : one ] will produce a set of states which form an abstract root system of simply laced type .",
    "we therefore begin by considering the connections between the approach outlined in section [ sec : one ] and the weyl constraints : a set @xmath59 of vectors @xmath60 with norm squared 2 form a root system of simply laced type iff they satisfy the following constraints @xcite ; @xmath61 from equations ( [ eq : defv ] ) and ( [ eq : defq ] ) , it is clear that , given @xmath62 we can define @xmath63 by replacing @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 so @xmath69 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath63 will satisfy modular invariance and the gso projection as long as @xmath60 does , and therefore equation ( [ eq : minus ] ) is satisfied .",
    "satisfying equation ( [ eq : crystal ] ) is a bit trickier .",
    "we can make it more transparent by expanding out only one of the roots , @xmath70 for some @xmath71 . from equations ( [ eq : defq ] ) and ( [ eq : elementsofalpha ] ) we can write the general form of @xmath72 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "so , ( [ eq : hold1 ] ) now gives @xmath75 where @xmath76 is now some integer which we can effectually ignore , leaving @xmath77 without loss of generality , we can take the @xmath66 s on the left hand side of ( [ eq : hold2 ] ) to have a single non - zero unit element .",
    "so , defining @xmath78 , we have that in order to satisfy equation ( [ eq : crystal ] ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 which is equivalent to what was stated in section [ sec : one ] .",
    "in other words , we have derived the general form of the gso projection merely by imposing the constraint that our formalism ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq : defq ] ) ) result in an abstract root system of simply laced type .",
    "a difficulty in collecting comprehensive statistics in the free fermionic approach ( in addition to the sheer size of this domain of the landscape ) is in finding an efficient means of systematically generating sets of @xmath82 s obeying equations ( [ eq : modinv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : modinv2 ] ) . to date , searches within the landscape of free fermionic heterotic models have been , although wide - ranging , have used random sampling @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with regard to random sampling within the free fermionic portion of the landsacape , is the issue of floating correlations , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this problem was shown in @xcite to be endemic to random statistical landscape searches and reflects the fact that not all physically distinct string models are equally likely to be sampled in any random search through the landscape or within a specific subspace .",
    "this can result in statistical correlations of phenomenological properties of models that `` float '' as a function of sample size .    while several possible methods were proposed in @xcite to overcome this problem ,",
    "an alternative is to devise a search method that is not random .",
    "the remainder of this paper is an exposition of a method of doing exactly this . as the simplest example",
    ", we will consider herein the set of layer 1 , order 2 calculations . since the primary purpose of this paper is to outline our general method , a vastly more detailed _",
    "systematic _ search , based on the approach introduced herein , will be the subject of a paper to soon follow @xcite .",
    "not counting the @xmath83 vector , if we have a layer @xmath84 set @xmath85 , @xmath86 , with orders @xmath87 , a brute force approach to finding all modular invariant sets requires calculating dot - products for @xmath88 candidate vectors , demanding a total of @xmath89 calculations , keeping track of valid sets along the way .",
    "this obviously becomes intractable even for very low orders and layers .",
    "layer one and order two ( which we will denote @xmath90 ) will demand @xmath91 , while @xmath92 demands @xmath93 .",
    "this can be simplified by putting the elements in order in @xmath94 .",
    "then , under each block of similar elements in @xmath95 , separately put each element of @xmath95 in order .",
    "this can be repeated for each successive @xmath17 . while this is extremely helpful for small @xmath84 , the need to order elements separately for each block of elements above",
    "quickly reduces the usefulness of this for higher layer .",
    "we can greatly simplify this problem by breaking the set of @xmath17 s into a tensor product of points in a lower dimensional space .",
    "we elaborate through examples . for an @xmath17 of , say , order @xmath96 ,",
    "the possible elements are @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we therefore specify a given order @xmath96 @xmath17 by a single number @xmath99 , which specifies the number of @xmath97 s .",
    "the @xmath97 s are assumed to be moved to the left , so that the @xmath100 @xmath98 s are to the right .",
    "for example , @xmath101 would specify the vector @xmath102 the dot - product is easy to calculate ; @xmath103 .    for order @xmath104 , the possible elements are @xmath105 .",
    "so , we specify an order @xmath104 @xmath17 with two numbers ; @xmath99 corresponding to @xmath106 , and @xmath107 corresponding to @xmath108 . in this case , @xmath109 .",
    "this generalizes in the obvious way to higher order . higher layer , however , is a bit more subtle .",
    "consider @xmath110 ( layer 2 , where the first @xmath17 is order 2 and the second is order 3 ) , the possible columns when the @xmath17 s are placed one above the other are @xmath111 so , the dot products in this case will be @xmath112    for a layer @xmath84 set with orders @xmath14 , there will be @xmath113 different @xmath114 s .",
    "thus , since we know that @xmath115 and , defining @xmath116 we find that the total number of calculation which must be performed in this approach is @xmath117 the improvement of this approach is therefore @xmath118 the improvement depends on the total order , not on the layer . to see this more clearly , we provide a graph of equation ( [ eq : improve ] ) through @xmath119 .        the improvement is greater for higher order .",
    "this is good news because there are no ordering conventions which help simplify in the original approach ( equation [ eq : original ] ) for large layer ( @xmath120 ) , which is where larger orders typically come from .",
    "recall that at @xmath92 , equation ( [ eq : original ] ) demanded @xmath93 calculations .",
    "equation ( [ eq : new ] ) , however , demands only @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , because we can now express any and all dot products as simple linear combinations of the @xmath114 s with rational coefficients , each calculations is straightforward addition , rather than a dot - product of a 22 component vector .",
    "we now show how to further reduce the complexity of the problem by simplifying the imposition of modular invariance .",
    "to begin , in writing out the content of each @xmath114 ( as in equation ( [ eq : nexample ] ) ) , we will always put the elements in order of decreasing magnitude , starting with the positive elements and then negative .",
    "for example , @xmath122 would be written as @xmath123 we then write @xmath124 .",
    "so , modular invariance ( [ eq : modinv1 ] ) demands @xmath125 this is a simple linear equation which can be imposed easily at each step .",
    "however , we can impose this _ a priori as follows . for an order @xmath18 @xmath17 ( we assume @xmath126 for now ) with the proper ordering ( as in ( [ eq : example2 ] ) )",
    ", the elements of @xmath82 will come from equation ( [ eq : elementsofalpha ] ) . if we demand that @xmath127 satisfy @xmath128 where @xmath129 is @xmath130 and specifies the element of @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath131 according to ( [ eq : elementsofalpha ] ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath129 is an integer such that @xmath132 is the element of @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath131 .",
    "for example , in ( [ eq : example2 ] ) , @xmath133 our ordering convention guarantees that this will always be an integer . _    for @xmath134",
    ", we can impose this constraint on each @xmath17 separately by demanding that the @xmath114 corresponding to the last non - zero element of each @xmath17 satisfy this constraint , with the sum going from 1 to the previous @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , our ordering of the @xmath114 s ensures that an @xmath114 corresponding to a final non - zero element will be unique . demanding this for each @xmath114 corresponding to the last non - zero element in each @xmath17",
    "will ensure that ( [ eq : modinv1 ] ) is always satisfied for each @xmath17 in the set .",
    "we can do something similar to impose ( [ eq : modinv2 ] ) . for",
    "the dot - product between @xmath11 and @xmath135 , let @xmath136 correspond to the last element which contributes to @xmath137 .",
    "for example , in ( [ eq : nexample ] ) this would be @xmath107 . once again , our ordering convention for the @xmath114 s ensures that each will be unique .",
    "if we impose @xmath138 where @xmath129 is the integer defining an element of @xmath11 and @xmath139 is the integer defining an element of @xmath135 , then ( [ eq : modinv2 ] ) will be satisfied .    to see this , consider @xmath140 as an example",
    ". we will have @xmath141 we then impose ( [ eq : squaredconstraint ] ) on @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , giving @xmath145",
    "so , we have ( for example ) @xmath146 similarly , @xmath147 next , we impose ( [ eq : dotprodcon ] ) on @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "@xmath151 thus , @xmath152 the constraints on @xmath148 and @xmath149 are similar .",
    "imposing modular invariance in this manner allows us to effectively generate acceptable input sets directly , sparing us the computational difficulty of checking huge numbers of unacceptable sets to find the ones we want .",
    "so , by designing an algorithm which expresses the sets of @xmath17 s in terms of @xmath114 s , and imposing ( [ eq : squaredconstraint ] ) and ( [ eq : dotprodcon ] ) , we can systematically generate comprehensive input sets at arbitrary order and layer , with a great deal of the work being done up front ( imposing ( [ eq : squaredconstraint ] ) and ( [ eq : dotprodcon ] ) ) .",
    "it remains to discuss how these sets are to be analyzed to generate statistics ( including consideration of models with initially matching gauge groups , that may or may not lead to possibilities for different models once matter sectors are added ) .",
    "this we leave for discussion in our upcoming paper .    before moving on ,",
    "we make one final observation . by combining ( [ eq : new ] ) , ( [ eq : squaredconstraint ] ) , and ( [ eq : dotprodcon ] ) , we can write down the approximate number of of sets which satisfy modular invariance for a given @xmath84 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 , @xmath155 this expression clearly increases monotonically for increasing layer and order , implying an infinite number of valid sets . however , it is likely that past a certain level of complexity the models will become redundant , providing an effective upper limit .    as an extremely elementary example of how this works , we consider the simplest possible example , @xmath90 .",
    "there is only one @xmath114 , and ( [ eq : squaredconstraint ] ) simplifies to @xmath156 , and equation ( [ eq : approx ] ) gives @xmath157 , which is a reasonable estimation of the obvious @xmath158 solutions , @xmath159 ( we exclude @xmath160 for obvious reasons ) .",
    "each of these models can be easily analyzed , giving table 1 .",
    "[ h ]     [ 0.5ex ] 4 & @xmath161 + 8 & @xmath162 + 12 & @xmath163 + 16 & @xmath164 + 20 & @xmath165 +    [ table : nonlin ]    using this approach , statistics at very high layer and order can be produced fairly easily .",
    "the results of such an analysis will be discussed in much more detail in an upcoming paper @xcite .",
    "we also wish to emphasize that the approach we have introduced here can be generalized to include matter sectors as well , as will be demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "as a final comment , we can rewrite ( [ eq : gso ] ) as @xmath166 for some set @xmath167 .    then , using ( [ eq : kijone ] ) and ( [ eq : kijtwo ] ) , we can write the cartan matrix of a given model as @xmath168 where the vector @xmath169 is a vector with components equal to the diagonal elements of @xmath44 , @xmath170 is the vector with @xmath31 element @xmath171 , and @xmath172 . using this , the left hand side can be defined for a specific gauge group , and then the right hand side can be solved as a system of coupled quadratics over positive integers .",
    "the interesting thing is that the right hand side has no @xmath17 dependence . a solution to this equation for a given @xmath169 , @xmath173 , and @xmath170 will provide a set of constraints for @xmath17 s which give the gauge group defined by the desired cartan matrix .",
