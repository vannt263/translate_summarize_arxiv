    "the properties of magnetic impurities in a metal is one of the most intensively studied problems in solid state physics .",
    "the work of friedel @xcite and anderson @xcite laid the foundation to understand why some transition - metal impurities form a local magnetic moment while others do nt .",
    "kondo @xcite showed that multiple scattering of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity yields a divergent contribution to the resistance in perturbation theory .",
    "yoshida @xcite introduced the concept that the ( spin 1/2 ) magnetic impurity forms a singlet state with the conduction electrons and is non - magnetic at zero temperature .",
    "these new insights stimulated a large body of theoretical and experimental work ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of experimental and theoretical work has focussed on the singlet kondo ground state .",
    "however , the `` magnetic state '' of the impurity is of equal or even greater importance because magnetic impurities are always present , including in micro - chips and nanostructures , and influence the thermodynamic and transport properties of the hosts .",
    "since many experiments and almost all technical applications are * not * performed at low temperatures the magnetic impurities are generally far above their kondo temperature @xmath0 and show their full magnetic behavior .",
    "the theoretical investigation of the magnetic state has been explored in much less detail than the kondo ground state for spin @xmath1 impurities .    in many cases",
    "the kondo temperature is very low , in the range of liquid helium temperature . in this case",
    "the impurity is in the magnetic state at relatively low temperature .",
    "( the word impurity is in this paper reserved to impurities which possess - at sufficiently high temperature - a magnetic moment ) .",
    "when the temperature is several times the kondo temperature one is sufficiently above @xmath0 to destroy the kondo ground state . on the other hand one may expect that the properties of the magnetic state are not yet influenced by the thermal excitations due to the finite temperature .",
    "therefore a number of theoretical investigations treat the magnetic state at zero temperature , i.e. as a magnetic ground state .",
    "this approach is probably justified but it leaves the work always vulnerable to the criticism that there is no magnetic moment at zero temperature .    therefore in this paper",
    "i prefer to use the effect of a magnetic field on the kondo state .",
    "a magnetic field which is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath2 ( @xmath3=bohr magneton ) destroys the kondo singlet state as well and yields the magnetic state .",
    "its side effects are that it changes the energy of the d - states by @xmath4 and shifts the conduction bands by @xmath4 .",
    "the latter yields the pauli susceptibility but has otherwise only a negligible effect on the interaction between the impurity and the conduction electrons because the fermi level for spin - up and down electrons readjusts to the same height ( as before ) .",
    "friedel @xcite and anderson @xcite derived a criterion for the instability of the paramagnetic state , i.e. the formation of a magnetic moment : take the density of states @xmath5 of the d - resonance at the fermi energy ( in the paramagnetic state ) and multiply it by the coulomb repulsion energy @xmath6 . if the product @xmath7 then a magnetic moment is formed . within mean field theory the d - density of states",
    "is given by a lorentz function@xmath8 where @xmath9 is an effective energy of the d - electrons in the spin - up or down state , @xmath10 while @xmath11 is the average occupation of the d - electron with the opposite spin ) and the resonance width @xmath12 is given in mean field theory by@xmath13 here @xmath14 is the s - d - hopping matrix element between a conduction electron and the d - state at the impurity and @xmath15 is the density of states of the conduction electrons . in the mean field theory",
    "an occupied @xmath16 electron state can only make transitions into @xmath17-states .",
    "( throughout this paper i express electron states by their creation operators ) .",
    "it is well known that the mean field theory has a number of shortcomings . during the last few years",
    "the group of the author has developed a new approach to the impurity problem , in particular the friedel - anderson and the kondo impurity . in this * fair * method a * * f**riedel state is * * a**rtificially  built from each conduction band and * * i**nserted as a * * r**esonance state into the conduction or s - band of spin - up and spin - down electrons . in the appendix a short review of the fair solution for the friedel impurity",
    "is sketched .",
    "the fair solution for the magnetic state yields a considerably lower energy for the `` magnetic ground state '' and requires a much larger critical coulomb interaction to form a magnetic state .",
    "this is of some practical importance since the mean field approximation is used in a number of numerical spin - density functional theory calculations for the magnetic moment of impurities in an ( s , p ) metal host @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition to the size of the magnetic moment one would like to know the density of states in the magnetic state . the answer of the mean field theory has been discussed above .",
    "but there have been a number of suggestions that the d - resonance is broader than the mean field suggests ( see for example logan @xcite ) .",
    "the mean field theory decouples the spin - up d - electron from the spin - down d - electron , but in reality",
    "the d - electrons are coupled through the coulomb energy . a transition in the @xmath16 electron state changes the energy and the state of the @xmath18 electron as well . therefore it has been suggested in the past that the d - resonances in the friedel - anderson impurity are larger than the mean field theory predicts .",
    "a wider d - resonance in the friedel - anderson impurity together with the condition @xmath7 would require a larger coulomb energy to form a magnetic moment .",
    "in this connection the previous result of the author that the fair solution requires a ( two times ) larger coulomb energy to form a magnetic moment would find a simple physical interpretation .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to calculate the density of states of the `` magnetic ground state '' in the fair solution and compare it with the mean field density of states . in section ii the theoretical background of the magnetic state of the friedel - anderson impurity is sketched . in section",
    "iii electrons and holes are introduced into the magnetic ground state .",
    "their interactions and excitation energies are derived . in section",
    "iv the results of the numerical calculations are presented . finally in section",
    "v and vi the results are discussed together with the conclusion . in the appendix a the basic idea of the fair method is sketched .",

    "imagine how much easier the task would be if the d - electron would interact only with a single electron state ( in each spin band ) . all other conduction band states would represent just a background or quasi - vacuum .",
    "this is the fair approach .    during the last few years the author introduced such a solution to the friedel - anderson impurity problem",
    "in which only four electron states , the spin - up and spin - down d - states @xmath16 and @xmath18 and two fair states , @xmath22 and @xmath23 interact through the coulomb and s - d - hopping potential .",
    "these states @xmath22 and @xmath24 are composed of the spin - up and spin - down conduction band states .",
    "they are the friedel artificially inserted resonance states or fair states .",

    "but in addition the second order perturbation of @xmath59 is extremely small .",
    "this is demonstrated in appendix b.    it may appear remarkable that the neglect of the interactions between the d - electron and all the band states @xmath60 and @xmath61 yields a realistic ground state .",
