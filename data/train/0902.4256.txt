    "if the hadronization process is independent of the target , the semi - inclusive cross section can be factorized into a product of a parton distribution function describing the hard scattering from a parton in the target , and the probability of the struck parton fragmenting into a specific hadron , parameterized by the fragmentation function . at the quark level , the semi - inclusive cross section for the production of pions from a nucleon target in the valence quark region ( @xmath15 ) is proportional ( at leading order in @xmath16 ) to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 quark charge , @xmath20 is the distribution of quarks @xmath21 in the nucleon @xmath22 with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath5 , and @xmath23 is the fragmentation function for quark @xmath21 to produce a pion with energy fraction @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the pion energy and @xmath10 the energy transfer to the target . in both the distribution functions and fragmentation functions we have suppressed the explicit dependence on the scale @xmath7 .",
    "the fragmentation functions are traditionally separated into favored and disfavored classes , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , where we have further assumed isospin symmetry in relating the fragmentation functions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the leading fragmentation approximation ,",
    "valid in the limit @xmath28 , the hadronization process is dominated by the favored fragmentation , and @xmath29 . in this approximation",
    "the cross sections for proton and neutron targets can be written as :    [ eq : nqpm ] @xmath30    where the quark distributions are defined to be those in the proton .",
    "similarly for a polarized target , the spin - dependent cross section can be written ( at leading order ) in terms of spin - dependent distribution functions @xmath31 and corresponding fragmentation functions @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 since the quark spins in a pion must average to zero , for pion production one expects the fragmentation functions to be independent of the polarization of the fragmenting quark , so that @xmath34 .    if the quark distributions and fragmentation functions factorize as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nxz ] ) , one can construct ratios of @xmath1 to @xmath0 yields on the neutron and proton which are given by simple ratios of quark charges , @xmath35 similarly for the spin - dependent cross sections , one finds the model - independent relations : @xmath36 this will serve as useful consistency checks on the duality between the partonic and hadronic descriptions of the semi - inclusive cross sections in the following section .",
    "in this section we describe the semi - inclusive production of pions using a hadronic basis within the su(6 ) quark model , generalizing the discussion of refs .",
    "@xcite on inclusive structure functions . in the earlier work @xcite , the su(6 ) model served as a useful framework in allowing one to visualize the underlying principles of quark - hadron duality and to provide a reasonably close contact with structure function phenomenology .",
    "as pointed out by close and isgur @xcite , duality between structure functions represented by ( incoherent ) parton distributions and by a ( coherent ) sum of squares of form factors can be achieved by summing over neighboring odd and even parity states . in the su(6 ) model this is realized by summing over states in the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , even parity ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , odd parity ) multiplets , with each representation weighted equally .    for semi - inclusive scattering ,",
    "pion production cross sections are constructed by summing coherently over excited nucleon resonances ( @xmath41 ) in the @xmath42-channel intermediate state and in the final state ( @xmath43 ) of @xmath14 , where both @xmath41 and @xmath43 belong to the @xmath37 and @xmath39 multiplets .",
    "duality is then demonstrated by comparing the hadronic - level results with those of the parton model in sec .",
    "[ sec : parton ] .    to generalized the model to values of @xmath5 away from @xmath4 , where su(6 ) symmetry is expected to be valid ,",
    "we incorporate various su(6 ) breaking mechanisms , along the lines of those discussed in ref .",
    "we recall that at the quark level , explicit su(6 ) breaking mechanisms produce different weightings of components of the initial state wave function , which in turn induces different @xmath5 dependences for the spin and flavor distributions . on the other hand , at the hadronic level su(6 ) breaking in the matrix elements leads to suppression of transitions to specific @xmath41 and @xmath43 resonances , while starting from a symmetric su(6 ) wave function for the initial state @xmath22 .",
    "the amplitudes for the transitions @xmath44 correspond to the absorption of a transversely polarized photon ( @xmath45 ) , exciting the nucleon to a state @xmath41 with total angular momentum @xmath46 described by the helicity amplitude @xmath47 . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume the interaction operator to be magnetic spin - flip , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the charge of the @xmath50-th quark and @xmath51 is the pauli spin raising operator , as appropriate in the deep inelastic limit @xcite .",

    "@xcite proportional to @xmath53 for @xmath54 emission , where @xmath55 is the isospin raising / lowering operator ( for the most general form of the operator see ref .",
    "the leading operator is in fact general for unpolarized scattering , but for spin - dependent transitions it implicitly assumes that the emitted pion is collinear ( or with @xmath56 ) , which is strictly valid only in the @xmath28 limit . for simplicity",
    "we retain this form in the present exploratory study , whose primary aim is to demonstrate the workings of duality in semi - inclusive scattering .",
    "in addition , the currently available data are for unpolarized cross sections , and refinements of the model to investigate the polarization dependence as a function of @xmath11 can be made in future when new spin - dependent data become available .    within this framework , the probabilities of the @xmath57 transitions can be obtained from tables  [ tab:2_8_56][tab:2_10_70 ] in appendix  [ sec : amplitudes ] by summing over the intermediate states @xmath41 spanning the @xmath37 and @xmath39 multiplets . in table",

    "( [ eq : nqpm ] ) .    furthermore , the inclusive results of ref .",
    "@xcite can be recovered by summing over the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels . in this case one",
    "finds the familiar results    @xmath86    again consistent with the parton level expectations .",
    "while the su(6 ) symmetric results may be expected to be approximately valid for structure functions at @xmath4 , at larger @xmath5 values strong deviations from su(6 ) symmetry are observed .",
    "these can be correlated with su(6 ) breaking effects in the transition form factors , as well as in hadron masses .",
    "it is well known that spin - dependent forces between quarks , such as from one gluon exchange @xcite , introduce a mass difference between the nucleon and @xmath87 .",
    "the same mechanism also leads to an anomalous suppression of the @xmath88 transition form factor relative to the nucleon elastic at high @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if the characteristic @xmath7 suppression of the @xmath87 excitation is related with the spin dependence , then it may be a feature of all @xmath89 states , namely the @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "in fact , in the approximation of magnetic coupling dominance , which is more accurate with increasing @xmath7 , only @xmath89 configurations allow non - zero @xmath92 cross sections .",
    "suppression of these then automatically gives unity for the polarized to unpolarized ratios , @xmath93    for the unpolarized ratios , including only the @xmath94 and @xmath95 contributions , the @xmath1 to @xmath0 ratios for the proton and neutron become : @xmath96 at the parton level , these results imply the ratio @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and a flavor - dependent ratio of down to up quark distributions @xmath100 .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of the inclusive duality study in ref .",
    "@xcite , confirming the duality between the parton and hadron level descriptions of the semi - inclusive scattering process also .",
    "if the mass difference between the nucleon and @xmath87 is attributed to spin dependent forces , the energy associated with the symmetric part of the nucleon wave function will be larger than that of the antisymmetric component . at the quark level",
    ", this pattern of suppression can be realized with a spin - dependent hyperfine interaction between quarks , @xmath101 , which modifies the spin-0 and spin-1 components of the nucleon wave function .",
    "physically this correlates with a `` diquark '' in a @xmath102 representation of the nucleon having a larger mass ( energy ) when the spin of the @xmath103 pair is 1",
    ". a suppression of the symmetric configuration at large @xmath5 will then give rise to a softening of the @xmath99 quark distribution relative to the @xmath104 , and leads to the proton and neutron polarization asymmetries becoming unity as @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "in terms of the su(6 ) representations , the @xmath106 * 10 * and @xmath107 * 8 * multiplets are in the @xmath39 , and the @xmath107 * 10 * unambiguously in the @xmath37 representation .",
    "however , the spin-1/2 @xmath94 can occur in both the @xmath37 and @xmath39 representations , and can be written in terms of symmetric @xmath108 and antisymmetric @xmath109 components , where @xmath110 is a product of the flavor ( @xmath111 ) and spin ( @xmath112 ) wave functions , and @xmath113 and @xmath114 denote the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations , respectively @xcite . in the su(6 ) limit one has an equal admixture of both @xmath114 and @xmath113 type contributions , whereas in the present scenario only the @xmath114 components in the @xmath37 and @xmath39 multiplets plays a role .",
    "in particular , since transitions to the ( symmetric ) spin-3/2 states ( @xmath107 * 8 * , @xmath107 * 10 * and @xmath106 * 10 * ) can only proceed through the symmetric @xmath113 component of the ground state wave function , the @xmath114 components will only excite the nucleon to @xmath106 * 8 * states .",
    "if the @xmath113 wave function is suppressed , only transitions to @xmath106 * 8 * states will be allowed .    to effect this scenario ,",
    "the simplest strategy is to sum coherently the @xmath106 * 8 * amplitudes in the intermediate @xmath41 states _ and _ in the final @xmath43 states in tables  [ tab:2_8_56 ] and [ tab:2_8_70 ] , before squaring the result to get the cross section .",
    "doing so one finds that @xmath1 production from the proton and @xmath0 production from the neutron are both suppressed : @xmath115 with the ratio of the unsuppressed yields being : @xmath116 these results are consistent with parton model results in which @xmath117 as @xmath105 .",
    "finally , since the @xmath106 * 8 * amplitudes have no helicity-3/2 components , the spin - dependent semi - inclusive cross sections will be identical to the spin - averaged ones , with all polarization asymmetries unity , again as in the parton level model .",
    "the central tenet of quark - hadron duality is the non - trivial relationship between the behavior of structure functions at large @xmath5 and that of transition form factors at high @xmath7 . at high @xmath7 perturbative qcd arguments",
    "suggest that the interaction of the photon should be predominantly with quarks having the same helicity as the nucleon @xcite . because the scattering of a photon from a massless quark conserves helicity",

    "suppression of the helicity-3/2 contributions means that the spin - dependent semi - inclusive cross sections are identical to the spin - averaged , @xmath93 this again is consistent with the parton model calculations which predict that @xmath97 for all quark flavors @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "recently the onset of duality in pion electroproduction was studied in scattering from proton and deuteron targets @xcite , with the missing mass @xmath67 of the residual system spanning the resonance region",
    ". ratios of @xmath0 to @xmath1 cross sections were found to exhibit features reminiscent of parton level factorization of the hard scattering and subsequent fragmentation processes , even at relatively low energies .",
    "in addition , the ratio of unfavored to favored fragmentation functions was found to closely resemble that observed at much higher energies from earlier experiments by hermes @xcite and emc @xcite .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of the qualitative features of the data could be understood in the simple quark model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and in sec .",
    "[ sec : n * ] above ) . in particular , for a deuteron target the resonance contributions to the @xmath13 ratio appear in a universal 4:1 ratio when summed over the @xmath37 and @xmath39 multiplets , and cancel in the ratio of unfavored to favored fragmentation functions @xmath125 , leaving only a smooth background as expected at higher energies .",
    "the absence of strong resonant enhancement on top of the smooth background is indeed one of the notable features of the data @xcite .",
    "although the lack of prominent @xmath12 structure in the semi - inclusive spectrum is in accord with duality , a quantitative comparison goes beyond the simple model discussed thus far . in our model",
    "an operator equivalent to @xmath126 is sandwiched between su(6 ) states for @xmath41 and @xmath43 , after which the initial and final states are summed over ( see appendix  [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "this mechanism allows only for leading fragmentation to take place , whereas the data @xcite clearly show that for @xmath127 the ratio @xmath128 .",
    "the model can therefore only be applied to the resonance part of the semi - inclusive cross section , and is not applicable to the nonresonant background , which makes up a sizable fraction of the data at @xmath129 .",
    "the simplest generalization of this formalism to the case of @xmath128 is to retain the assumption that the pion production operator factors from the initial and final @xmath12 , but allow the possibility that the @xmath104 quark , for instance , can fragment to a @xmath1 .",
