    "@xmath0re is an attractive therapeutic radioisotope with broad clinical applications .",
    "oncology applications range from palliation of metastatic bone pain to bone marrow ablation and in general to the use of @xmath0re labelled therapeutic agents to target specific cancerous tissues ( see for instance reference @xcite ) .",
    "other therapeutic applications comprise the inihibition of restenosis after percutanueous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) , radiation synovectomy , and intravasal brachytherapy . in the field of metabolic",
    "radiotherapy @xmath0re shows several favourable characteristics .",
    "it can be produced carrier free using a w - re generator ( see for instance reference @xcite ) and its chemistry is similar to that of @xmath3tc which is the most used radioisotope in nuclear medicine ( medical imaging ) .",
    "the @xmath0w parent has a 69 d half - life , which permits to use the generator for a relatively long period , the equilibrium between parent and daughter setting up within about two days .",
    "@xmath0re decays to @xmath0os@xmath6 in about 0.7 days via the emission of a @xmath7-ray with a maximum energy of 2.12 mev ( 0.78 mev average energy ) , which can be used for destroying cancerous cells .",
    "in addition @xmath0os@xmath6 emits promptly ( 0.69 ns ) a 155 kev @xmath2-ray ( 15% ) , which can be used for imaging .",
    "given the chemical similarity with @xmath3tc , it can be linked to molecules of hyaluronic acid ( ha ) which have the function of carrying it to specific sites in the body , e.g. with the production of an accumulation and retention of the drug in the liver @xcite .",
    "hence the potential interest for treating liver cancers . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath7 radiation could interfere with the labelling process and destroy the molecule used to carry the radioisotope in the body to the target organ , thus reducing the therapeutic effect .",
    "two additional points have to do with the relatively long lifetime and with the rich photon spectrum of @xmath0re , which extends to high energy , compared to the single 140 kev photon emitted by @xmath3tc with a half - life of about 6 h. taking into account the branching ratios ( br ) and the lifetimes , the relative @xmath0re/@xmath3tc counting rate , for an equal number of @xmath8-moles , is about 9% .",
    "this implies that photon detectors developed for imaging with @xmath3tc are not necessarily sensitive enough .",
    "the usual thickness of a low - energy pb collimator , say 20 mm , will be almost transparent to @xmath0re photon lines at 300 kev or higher energies , even with brs depressed by a factor of ten or more , producing background counts which blur the image and worsen the spatial resolution . to study the effect of metabolic radiotherapy in mice , we have therefore built a new small high - sensitivity @xmath2-camera , following the experience with the yap - camera @xcite@xcite@xcite , which is used routinely to image small animals ( mice ) with @xmath3tc - ha at the laboratori nazionali di legnaro , italy ( e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the gamma camera is based on a matrix of yttrium aluminium perovskite doped with cerium ( yap : ce or yalo@xmath9:ce ) crystals @xcite , with friendly mechanical properties ( no igroscopicity ) , fast response ( @xmath1025 ns decay time ) , high density ( 5.37 g / cm@xmath5 ) and good x- and @xmath2-ray absorption .",
    "there are 66@xmath466 pixels , each 0.6@xmath40.6@xmath410 mm@xmath5 , covering a field - of - view ( fov ) of 40@xmath440 mm@xmath12 .",
    "the pixels are covered laterally by a special 5 @xmath8 m thick reflective coating which provides also the optical separation between neighboring elements .",
    "the scintillator is read out by a r2486 hamamatsu positionsensitivepmt @xcite with a 76 mm diameter photocathode .",
    "the anode consists of 16 plus 16 wires crossing at 90@xmath13 and connected by two resistive chains , defining the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions .",
    "the wires define an active area with a diameter of about 50 mm . a 20 mm thick lead parallel hexagonal - hole collimator @xcite , with hole diameter 1.5 mm and septa of 0.18 mm , is placed in front of the yap matrix .",
    "the detector is triggered using the last dynode and the ends of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 resistive chains ( x@xmath16 , x@xmath17 , y@xmath16 , y@xmath17 ) are amplified , stretched and read out by a pc using a pci 6023e card @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of the photon impact point are then reconstructed by charge division ,    @xmath18    and similarly for @xmath15 .",
    "the energy response of the detector to a spatially uniform source ( flat field ) of @xmath3tc 140 kev photons prior to energy equalization has been determined using a solution containing @xmath3tc which covered the whole fov and was located a few centimeters in front of the collimator surface .",
    "the @xmath19 has been arbitrarily divided in pixels and the average energy computed in each pixel .",
    "the corrections to the measured energy extracted from this calibration are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flat ] and have been used in the following . as shown below with the @xmath0re spectrum ,",
    "these corrections improve the energy resolution of the detector . apart from the energy equalization , no other correction has been applied . with @xmath3tc the sensitivity of the gamma camera",
    "is found to be @xmath102@xmath410@xmath20 or @xmath107@xmath410@xmath5",

    "in addition @xmath21am and @xmath22co , together with @xmath3tc photons , permit the calibration of energy scale . the overall energy spectrum is presented in fig .  [ fig : acc - en ] and the cumulative image of the sources is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : acc - im ] .",
    "the 60 kev is well prominent and a 122 kev shoulder is also visible ; @xmath23cs instead produces a broad shoulder at about half of the photon energy . using appropriate energy cuts",
    "the three images can be separated .",
    "the intrinsic spatial resolution of the system is quite good , since individual collimator holes can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : acc - im ] .",
    "the resolution however is worsened in practice by the small thickness of the septa relative to the hole diameter of the present collimators , making them partially transparent to radiation , so the actual effective resolution is @xmath24@xmath14 @xmath10 3 mm fwhm at 122 kev .",

    "the 155 kev line is prominent , but many more lines are present at higher energy , in some cases , e.g. at @xmath10300 kev , with brs only a factor of ten lower , or at 800 - 1200 kev with intensities lower only by a factor of 100 @xcite .    re spectrum measured with a ge detector.,width=8 ]    the @xmath0re spectrum measured with the yap camera during the imaging of a c57 mouse ( see next section )",

    "after general anesthesia , the solution with an activity of about 250 @xmath8ci was injected in the caudal vein .",
    "the mouse was positioned along the diagonal of the fov , with the locus of injection outside it , and was monitored for about three hours .",
