    "the process of gene silencing is a crucial building block for the picture geneticists developed during the last decade about the functioning of genes within all kinds of organisms .",
    "gene silencing is a highly complex area of research , and several mechanisms have been identified that inhibit gene expression within the nucleus .    the simplest molecular model to explain gene silencing postulates that specific repressors regulate the onset of transcription , by binding directly to specific dna sequences and counteracting the action of activators and of the transcriptional machinery .",
    "a second possibility is that repressors , bound at specific sequences called silencing elements , might act by regulating the structure of the folded state of the dna , called chromatin . in the cell nucleus",
    ", dna is wrapped around histones to form the fundamental chromatin unit called nucleosome , and adjacent nucleosomes are able to fold into a higher - order chromatin fiber .",
    "these structures reduce the accessibility of dna to the transcriptional machinery , and repressors might prevent transcription by stabilizing the binding of histones to dna , or the folding of nucleosomes in compact higher - order chromatin structures .    beside these levels of regulation ,",
    "another level exists : namely the three - dimensional organization of chromosomal domains in the cell nucleus during cellular differentiation and development  @xcite . in several cases ,",
    "gene silencing has been correlated with relocation of chromosomal domains . in most of the published studies ,",
    "gene silencing correlated with gene positioning close to heterochromatic compartments .",
    "heterochromatin represents a highly compact region of chromatin where genes are stably repressed .",
    "another case of gene silencing that shares common features with heterochromatin silencing involves the proteins of the polycomb group ( pcg )  @xcite .",
    "pcg proteins are highly conserved regulatory factors that are responsible for the maintenance of the silent state of important developmental genes , such as homeotic genes . in drosophila melanogaster ,",
    "pcg proteins form multimeric complexes and regulate their genes through binding to chromosomal regulatory elements named pcg response elements ( pres ) .",
    "this silencing involves repressive modifications on the target chromatin .",
    "in addition , it has been observed that silencing via pcg proteins and pres is enhanced by the presence of multiple copies of pre - containing elements in the nucleus .",
    "these copies may , but do not have to be on the same chromosome .",
    "long - distance pairing between these two loci , which brings them closer together than they would usually be , leads to strong repression of the genes they control ( bantignies et al  @xcite ) .",
    "this type of regulation represents silencing by geometrical closeness , established in interphase nuclei ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ban0307 ] ) .    in this report , we tried to model long - distance interactions among pres , with the long term goal to build predictive models for proximity and interactions of chromosomal domains . within the model , chromosomes were assigned a rabl configuration  @xcite in the nucleus , a situation which is present in drosophila embryonic nuclei .",
    "we calculated the expected distance distribution of the two loci in question and compared this distribution to experimental results that were obtained previously .",
    "in our model the two arms of the chromosomes carrying the gene loci are represented by two polymer chains .",
    "these chains are built up of ellipsoidal monomer segments with a ratio of @xmath5 between the half - axis ( for a detailed description of the physical model used see  @xcite ) .",
    "the chains have to be non - ideal , because the chromosomes can not penetrate one another .",
    "hence we have to demand that neither of the two monomers can occupy the same space at the same time . to ensure that our model is comparable to a rabl configuration , where the dna is  stretched  from the apical pole of the cell nucleus to its bottom pole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ban0307 ] ) , we need a force acting on polymers which hinders them from curling .",
    "the easiest way to do so is to fix the chains between two walls .",
    "the distance between these walls should be large enough to ensure the stretching , yet small enough to allow for movement of the chains . in our model the ratio between chain length and wall - to - wall - distance ranges from 1.5 to 5 .",
    "both chains have the same length , with the end - points fixed in a plane .",
    "the upper and lower end - points are symmetrical ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : paramdef ] ) .    .",
    "the chain contour length is @xmath6.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the distance between the fixed points on the first wall ( @xmath7 ) is kept small so they are essentially at the same point compared to the chain length . in our simulations",

    "the distribution follows a power law : @xmath22 whereas for large values a stretched exponential dampening factor dominates : @xmath23 [ eqn : upperscale ] where @xmath24 is some polynomial function . for the free case , @xmath25 is a universal parameter that depends solely on the dimensionality @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath26=3 we have @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution @xmath28 depends on @xmath29 solely through the ratio @xmath30 .",
    "changes in the geometry of the chain environment ( e.g. by the introduction of wedges or walls ) lead to changes in the value of the parameter @xmath25 , but leave the overall scaling predictions unaffected  @xcite . in our study",
    "we are simulating two stretched chains with fixed endpoints , which might be considered as a single one as long as the fixpoint distance @xmath7 is kept small .",
    "one of our goals is to determine the shape of the distance distributions between arbitrary monomers under these highly restraining conditions . + even if considering the distribution function of the distance @xmath31 between two arbitrary steps @xmath32 and @xmath33 of a free saw , the form of the distance distribution changes from the end - to - end case .",
    "though we might expect that a section of a free saw would behave also like a shorter free saw itself , this is not the case .",
    "the loss of entropy at the endpoints leads to a loss of the shape properties . +",
    "in our case , the chains are fixed between two walls and therefore a force is exerted on them which restricts their ability of movement .",
    "additionally , we have to expect further changes in the properties of the chains due to loss of entropy as we fix the position of the end point vectors of the walk precisely ( the wall fixpoints ) , and others have to stay in restricted areas ( because both start and end points of the walk are fixed ) .",
    "this means we are sampling over a distinct subunit of the ensemble of configurations of all free saws , which most probably has consequences on the distributions @xmath34 of the distances between monomer @xmath35 on chain 1 and monomer @xmath36 on chain 2 .",
    "determining the shape of these distance distributions has been an important aspect of our simulations . we were able to verify by @xmath37-minimum fits to ascertain that for most combinations of ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) , @xmath38 is gaussian .",
    "however , in those situations where the distribution had a small mean value , the shape clearly deviated from the gaussian form . in these cases our fits pointed towards a stretched exponential for the upper end of the distribution , where the stretching exponent is different from @xmath39 which was valid for the free end - to - end distance distributions ( see equation  [ eqn : upperscale ] ) .",
    "this observation will have to be verified on simulations with improved statistics .",
    "our simulations will be compared with two different sets of experiments . in both cases",
    "the two genetic loci in question were positioned on different chromosomes .",
    "this makes our model applicable as there is no direct connection between the chromosomal arms we consider .",
    "if they were positioned on different arms of the same chromosome , the centromer region might serve as a transmitter , any  tugging motion  of one locus might be perceptible for the other one . fixing both chains to different fixpoints on the wall",
    "does not incorporate this feature . in both experiments , copies of an element called _ fab-7 _",
    "( _ fab-7 _ is an element containing a pre that regulates an homeotic gene of drosophila melanogaster ) have been inserted into different loci x and y :    experiment i : :    used _ drosophila _ embryo cells , for which _",
    "fab-7 _ had been inserted at    locus x1 ( `` _ sd _ '' ) and y1 ( `` bx - c '' ) .",

    "fab-7 _ had been inserted at    locus x2 ( `` _ sd _ '' ) and y2 ( `` 38f '' ) .",
    "locus x2 ( `` _ sd _ '' ) is still    approximately one third from the top of the nucleus , but locus y2    ( `` 38f '' ) is much closer to it ( @xmath40 one sixth to one    eighth ) according to f.  bantignies .    to make the distance distributions obtained through the simulations comparable to these experimental results",
    ", we have to scale the data .",
    "we may assume that the fixpoints on the walls in our simulation correspond to ( loose ) binding of the chromosomes to the membrane of the nucleus as outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : spherescale ] .",
    "we neglected the fix point distance at the top ( @xmath7 ) as it is quite small compared to @xmath3 .",
    "as we know the diameter @xmath41 of the sphere , we can use it to find an approximate scaling relation .",
    "in fact , this is the highest scaling factor we may assume that allows us to map the simulation setup into the inside of the nucleus . if we were to consider the less likely scenario where the ends of our chromosomes are not fixed to the cell membrane , but to some other place within the nucleus , our scaling factor would have to be chosen smaller , as the distance between the beginning and the end points of the chains , which we hold fixed , will correspond to less than the diameter of the nucleus",
