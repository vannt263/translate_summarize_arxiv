    "weakly bound few - body systems are being studied since a long time back and have achieved revived interest recently as the physics of such weakly bound systems can be investigated experimentally in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . utilizing the feshbach resonance , the effective inter - atomic interaction can be changed essentially to any desired values  @xcite .",
    "the recent experiments on cold atoms also provide evidence of the existence of large weakly bound clusters . thus our present study is motivated by the recent experiments on ultracold bose gas .",
    "we treat the three - dimensional bosonic cluster with maximum up to @xmath4 rb atoms interacting through two - body van der waals potential .",
    "alkali atoms , specially rb atoms , are good candidates for laser manipulation and to observe bose - einstein condensate  @xcite . at ultracold temperature",
    "the interatomic interaction is fairly well represented by a single parameter @xmath5 , the @xmath6wave scattering length . for our present system",
    "we keep @xmath7 @xmath8 which corresponds to the jila experiment  @xcite .",
    "thus the system is weakly interacting , and diffuse as the average size of the cluster increases with cluster size .",
    "the binding of such @xmath9body cluster is provided by the two - body van der waals potential having a short range repulsive core below a cutoff radius and a @xmath10 tail which represents the long range attractive interaction .    the stability of such @xmath9body clusters , their energetics and various structural properties are recently studied  @xcite .",
    "we propose the use of two - body basis function to describe various properties of bosonic clusters . with more than three particles",
    "the system becomes more complex as the number of degrees of freedom increases .",
    "we have investigated correlations between energies of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 systems and observe the generalized tjon line  @xcite for large cluster .",
    "now we consider the spectral statistics and spectral correlation of the atomic clusters of different sizes as these contain rich physics and also plays an pivotal role to establish the universal properties of quantum systems .",
    "berry and tabor conjectured that the fluctuation property of energy levels of a quantum system whose classical analog is regular , is characterised by poisson statistics  @xcite .",
    "whereas , the fluctuation property of energy levels of a quantum system whose corresponding classical dynamical system is fully chaotic obeys the bohigas - giannoni - schmit ( bgs ) conjecture  @xcite .",
    "this tells that gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) or gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) or gaussian sympletic ensemble ( gse ) statistics of random matrix theory , depending on time reversal symmetry and rotational symmetry of the system , will describe the fluctuation properties .",
    "however this conjecture is often interpreted in another way and the observation of level repulsion in the spectrum is treated as an indication of the non - integrability of the system .",
    "the poisson distribution implies complete randomness in the relative positions of energy levels as they are completely uncorrelated . on",
    "the other hand wigner distribution implies strong correlation among the energy levels .    earlier the spectral properties of many different quantum systems like atoms , atomic nuclei , quantum billiards have been studied  @xcite .",
    "also some attempts have been made for non - interacting many - bosons and interacting bosonic system  @xcite .",
    "recently we have reported the level spacing distribution of ultra - cold interacting bosons trapped in a harmonic potential  @xcite .",
    "we found intriguing effect of both the interatomic interaction and the trap and observed deviation from the bgs cojecture . in this paper",
    "we are interested in similar type of calculation in the van der waals bosonic clusters .",
    "unlike the bose - einstein condensate where the external trapping provides the stability of the condensate , the van der waals clusters are bound due to the van der waals interaction . in the very dilute condition one may treat it as a uniform bose gas .",
    "apart from the experimental interest , this kind of systems are also challenging for the following reasons .",
    "first , solving the many - body schrdinger equation itself is a challenging numerical task due to many degrees of freedom and the obvious question is what kind of approximation is to be valid for the description of such clusters .",
    "secondly for large cluster size when the system becomes very much correlated , one may expect wigner type spectral distribution .",
    "however it needs an exhaustive study as level repulsion in the energy spectrum may not always lead to wigner distribution which signifies chaos .",
    "it indicates that one may need to use some deformed goe type of distribution for the correct description of nonintegrable but non - chaotic system .",
    "we propose to study several measures of spectral fluctuations and spectral correlation to determine the degree of influence of the interatomic interaction .",
    "this kind of study is also relevant as the statistical fluctuation can be directly observed experimentally in the context of ultracold bose gases .",
    "we calculate nearest neighbour level spacing distribution ( nnsd ) @xmath0 , the level number variance @xmath1 and the dyson - mehta @xmath13-statistics  @xcite for various cluster sizes .",
    "however all these measures require unfolding of the spectrum to remove variation in the density of energy levels in different parts of the spectrum .",
    "we can either unfold the spectrum of each member of the ensemble separately and form ensemble averaged nnsd or a single unfolding function can be used for all the members of the ensemble . depending on the unfolding procedure , the final outcome of nnsd may vary .",
    "moreover suitable unfolding function is not always known a priori and generally is approximated by higher order polynomials . therefore to verify the outcome of the nnsd , we further analyze the distribution of quotients of successive spacings @xmath3 which does not require any unfolding and is independent of the energy level density .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the many - body potential harmonic expansion method .",
    "section iii discusses the numerical results and section iv concludes with the summary of our work .",
    "to study the spectral statistics and different spectral correlations we need to calculate a large number of energy levels of the diffuse rb cluster .",
    "we approximately solve the full many - body schrdinger equation by our recently developed potential harmonic expansion method .",
    "we have earlier applied it successfully to study different properties of bec  @xcite and atomic clusters  @xcite .",
    "the methodology has already been described in detail in our earlier works  @xcite .",
    "hence here we describe it briefly for interested readers .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath14 rb atoms , each of mass @xmath15 and interacting via two - body potential .",
    "the time - independent quantum many - body schrdinger equation is given by @xmath16\\psi(\\vec{r}_{1}, ...",
    ",\\vec{r}_{n})=0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the total energy of the system , @xmath18 is the two - body potential and @xmath19 is the position vector of the @xmath20th particle . it is usual practice to decompose the motion of a many - body system into the motion of the center of mass and the relative motion of the particles in center of mass frame . in absence of any confinig potential",
    "the center of mass behaves as a free particle in laboratory frame and we set its energy as zero .",
    "hence , after elimination of the center of mass motion and using standard jacobi coordinates , defined as  @xcite @xmath21 we obtain the equation for the relative motion of the atoms @xmath22\\psi(\\vec{\\zeta}_{1 } , ... , \\vec{\\zeta}_{\\mathcal{n } } ) =   0\\hspace*{.1cm},\\ ] ] @xmath23 is the sum of all pair - wise interactions .",
    "now it is to be noted that hyperspherical harmonic expansion method is an _ ab - initio _ tool to solve the many - body schrdinger equation where the total wave function is expanded in the complete set of hyperspherical basis  @xcite .",
    "although hyperspherical harmonic expansion method is a complete many - body approach and includes all possible correlations , it is highly restricted to @xmath24 only .",
    "but for a diffuse cluster like rb - cluster , only two - body correlation and pairwise interaction are important",
    ". therefore we can decompose the total wave function @xmath25 into two - body faddeev component for the interacting @xmath26 pair as @xmath27 it is important to note that @xmath28 is a function of two - body separation ( @xmath29 ) only and the global hyperradius @xmath30 , which is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "thus the effect of two - body correlation comes through the two - body interaction in the expansion basis .",
    "@xmath28 is symmetric under the exchange operator @xmath32 for bosonic atoms and satisfy the faddeev equation @xmath33\\phi_{ij } = -v(\\vec{r}_{ij})\\sum_{kl > k}^{n}\\phi_{kl}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the total kinetic energy operator . in this approach",
    ", we assume that when ( @xmath35 ) pair interacts , the rest of the bosons are inert spectators . thus the total hyperangular momentum quantum number as also the orbital angular momentum of the whole system",
    "is contributed by the interacting pair only .",
    "next the @xmath26th faddeev component is expanded in the set of potential harmonics ( ph ) ( which is a subset of hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis and sufficient for the expansion of @xmath36 ) appropriate for the ( @xmath35 ) partition as @xmath37 @xmath38 denotes the full set of hyperangles in the @xmath39-dimensional space corresponding to the @xmath26 interacting pair and @xmath40 is called the ph .",
    "it has an analytic expression : @xmath41 @xmath42 is the hh of order zero in the @xmath43 dimensional space spanned by @xmath44 jacobi vectors ; @xmath45 is the hyperangle between the @xmath46-th jacobi vector @xmath47 and the hyperradius @xmath30 and is given by @xmath48 = @xmath49 . for the remaining @xmath50 noninteracting bosons",
    "we define hyperradius as @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "the set of @xmath53 quantum numbers of hh is now reduced to _ only _ @xmath54 as for the @xmath50 non - interacting pair @xmath55 and for the interacting pair @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus the @xmath39 dimensional schrdinger equation reduces effectively to a four dimensional equation with the relevant set of quantum numbers : energy @xmath17 , orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath59 , azimuthal quantum number @xmath15 and grand orbital quantum number @xmath60 for any @xmath11 . substituting in eq(4 ) and projecting on a particular ph ,",
    "a set of coupled differential equation for the partial wave @xmath61 is obtained @xmath62u_{kl}(r ) + \\displaystyle{\\sum_{k^{\\prime}}}f_{kl}v_{kk^{\\prime}}(r ) f_{k^{\\prime}l } u_{k^{\\prime}l}(r ) = 0&\\\\ \\hspace*{.1 cm } , \\end{array } \\label{eq.cde}\\ ] ] + where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "+ @xmath67 is a constant and represents the overlap of the ph for interacting partition with the sum of phs corresponding to all partitions  @xcite .",
    "the potential matrix element @xmath68 is given by @xmath69    here we would like to point out that we did not require the additional short - range correlation function @xmath70 for rb clusters as was necessary for dilute bec .",
    "a bec is designed to be very dilute and hence confined by a harmonic oscillator potential of low frequency ( @xmath71 hz ) .",
    "the average interatomic separation is thus very large ( @xmath72 ) compared with the range of atom - atom interaction ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "moreover the kinetic energy of the atoms is extremely small .",
    "hence the effective interaction for large @xmath74 is controlled by the @xmath75-wave scattering length ( @xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by the inclusion of the correlation function  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "diffuse van der waals clusters are weakly bound by the actual interatomic van der waals potential ( of range @xmath76 ) , without any confinement . hence no correlation function is needed .",
    "the average inter - particle separation is large enough , so that only two - body correlations are expected to be adequate , at least for light clusters .",
    "as pointed earlier we choose the van der waals potential with a hard core of radius @xmath77 as the interaction potential , @xmath78= @xmath79 for @xmath80 and = @xmath81 for @xmath82 . for rb atoms ,",
    "the value of @xmath83 is 2803 ev @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "the unmanipulated scattering length corresponding to rb - dimer is @xmath85 @xmath8 .",
    "we obtain @xmath5 by solving the two - body schrdinger equation for zero - energy  @xcite .",
    "we adjust the hard core radius in the two - body equation to obtain the dimer scattering length . in the fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite , we see the value of @xmath5 changes from negative to positive passing through an infinite discontinuity as @xmath77 decreases .",
    "each discontinuity corresponds to one extra two - body bound state .",
    "we observe that tiny change in @xmath77 across the infinite discontinuity causes @xmath5 to jump from very large positive value to very large negative value . for our present calculation ,",
    "we tune @xmath77 such that it corresponds to single bound state of the dimer .",
    "thus calculated @xmath77 is @xmath86 for dimer scattering length of rb atoms . with this set of values of @xmath83 and @xmath77",
    ", we next solve the coupled differential equation [ [ eq.cde ] ] by hyperspherical adiabatic approximation  @xcite . in hyperspherical adiabatic approximation ,",
    "the hyperradial motion is assumed slow compared to hyperangular motion .",
    "for the hyperangular motion for a fixed value of @xmath30 , we diagonalize the potential matrix together with the hypercentrifugal term .",
    "thus the effective potential for the hyperradial motion is obtained as a parametric function of @xmath30 . for the ground state of the system",
    "we choose the lowest eigenpotential @xmath87 [ corresponding eigen column vector being @xmath88 as the effective potential .",
    "we plot the effective potential @xmath87 as a function of hyperradius @xmath30 , at the dimer scattering length and for various cluster size @xmath893 , 5 and 40 in fig .",
    "[ fig.pot ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "study of energy level statistics plays an important role in elucidating the universal properties of quantum systems .",
    "berry and tabor conjectured that the eigenenergy levels of a quantum system whose classical dynamics shows integrability , must exhibit the fluctuation property as determined by the uncorrelated poisson statistics .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the bgs conjecture which asserts that the fluctuation property of energy levels of a quantum system whose classical dynamics should exhibit goe ( or gue or gse ) statistics .",
    "however , complicated quantum many - body systems often lie between these two contrasting conjectures",
    ".    thus the purpose of present paper is to consider a relatively complex quantum system whose experimental realization is possible .",
    "the van der waals bosonic cluster is such a quantum system which starts to be more and more complex with increase in cluster size . the above mentioned contrasting conjectures have been examined thoroughly by using various statistical observables like nnsd , level number variance @xmath1 and the spectral rigidity @xmath90 .",
    "these observables highlight the short and long range correlation , level repulsion , level clustering and how the features of the above observables crucially depend on the cluster size are also focussed .",
    "our detailed numerical analysis reveals that for smaller cluster when the system is very close to integrability , berry and tabor conjecture is followed . for large cluster",
    "although we observe similar to bgs conjecture , however deviation occurs . for large clusters",
    "the system becomes strongly correlated but does not exhibit true chaos .",
    "however our present study reveals that the deformed goe type of distribution may be suitable for future investigation .",
