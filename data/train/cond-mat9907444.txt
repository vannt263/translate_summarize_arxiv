    "since 1979 it became clear that non - interacting electrons are always localized in a 2d disordered potential @xcite . at present",
    "this result is firmly confirmed by different analytical and numerical studies ( see the reviews @xcite ) according to which all one - particle eigenstates are exponentially localized in the case of orthogonal or unitary symmetry .",
    "delocalization is possible only for the symplectic symmetry which is however not realized in the absence of spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , the discovery of metallic behavior in 2d high mobility samples by kravchenko _ et .",
    "@xcite attracted a great interest of the solid - state community and pushed forward the question about a role of electron - electron interactions in the localized phase .",
    "indeed , in many experiments of different groups @xcite the ratio of the coulomb interaction energy @xmath4 to the fermi energy @xmath5 is characterized by a large dimensionless parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electron density in 2d , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the effective bohr radius , electron mass and dielectric constant , respectively . typically in the above experiments",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is ranged in the interval 5 - 40 showing that these experiments are well outside of the perturbative regime corresponding to @xmath11 . generally , in these experiments",
    "the insulating increase of resistivity at low temperature @xmath12 is observed at large @xmath0 values ( low charge density @xmath7 ) , while its metallic decrease at low @xmath12 is seen at lower @xmath0 ( higher @xmath7 ) .",
    "in addition , experimentally it was found that a sufficiently strong magnetic field parallel to the 2d plane destroys the metallic behavior @xcite .",
    "these results show an important role of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we should note that the recent experiments @xcite with n - sige samples demonstrate that the metallic behavior persists even in very strong in plane magnetic field when all spins are polarized .",
    "another important experimental indication was found for a localized phase with a variable range hopping ( vrh ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the experiments show that a prefactor in the exponential vrh resistivity dependence on temperature is phonon independent @xcite . for the theoretical explication of this result other physical mechanisms of vrh",
    "should be found @xcite and it is possible that their origin is related to the electron - electron interaction as it had beed discussed long ago in @xcite .    from the theoretical view point",
    "the problem of interaction in the localized phase is rather nontrivial . indeed , due to localization of noninteracting states , the two interacting particles ( tip ) , with a short range repulsive / attractive interaction and located on a distance of one - particle localization length @xmath13 from each other , always return to their center of mass that enhances enormously their interaction . as a result the two particles can propagate coherently on a distance much larger @xmath13 .",
    "this effect has been discussed recently by different groups for a short range interaction @xcite ( see also the early paper by dorokhov for a strongly attractive case @xcite ) . however , in the experiments discussed above the charge density is very low and the distance between electrons ( holes ) is much larger than @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . in this situation",
    "the localized electrons interact via the long range coulomb interaction .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that in this situation two interacting electrons can be delocalized even when they are separated by a distance @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , this delocalization goes in a way very similar to the anderson transition in 3d . in this paper",
    "we discuss the physical origin of this delocalization ( section ii ) .",
    "after that ( section iii ) we present the results of extensive numerical studies of up to @xmath2 electrons ( with polarized spins ) on 2d disordered lattice . in agreement with the first results presented in @xcite",
    "we establish that the ground state remains localized ( nonergodic ) but at moderate values of parameter @xmath0 the electrons become ergodic at very low total energy where their spectral statistics demonstrates a transition from the poisson to the wigner - dyson distribution .",
    "the conclusion is presented in section iv .",
    "let us consider a system of electrons with polarized spins on a 2d disordered lattice ( anderson model ) .",
    "such polarization can be reached by a strong in plane magnetic field but also one can speak about spinless fermions .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath19 , the hopping between the nearest neighbors is @xmath20 , the diagonal energies @xmath21 are randomly distributed within the interval @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 is the strength of the coulomb interaction with @xmath24 being the distance between electrons at sites @xmath25 . in this notation @xmath26",
    "is the occupation number at site @xmath19 .",
    "the electrons ( particles ) are moving in a 2d cell of size @xmath27 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the coulomb interaction is taken between electrons in one cell of size @xmath28 and with 8 charge images in nearby 8 cells as in @xcite . the number of particles @xmath3 and the cell size were varied within the intervals @xmath29 and @xmath30 . with the notations of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the parameter @xmath0 is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the filling factor and @xmath33 .",
    "the majority of our data have been obtained for @xmath34 , @xmath35 that corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "when changing @xmath3 the filling factor was kept approximately constant ( nearest rational value ) by the appropriate choice of @xmath28 .    for @xmath37 all states in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) are localized and the one - particle localization length varies exponentially with @xmath38 in the limit of weak disorder : @xmath39 .",
    "the numerical diagonalization @xcite allows to determine the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) for one particle @xmath40 , which approximately gives the number of lattice sites contributing in one eigenstate .",
    "the values found at @xmath41 for different disorder strength at the ground state and the middle of the band are correspondingly : @xmath40 = 3.4 and 4.2 @xmath42 ; 5.2 and 11.2 @xmath43 ; 8.2 and 36.7 @xmath44 ; 13.5 and 84.2 @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that the one - particle states at low energy and even at the band center ( except maybe @xmath46 ) are well localized @xmath47 .    to understand how two electrons interact in the 2d localized phase we should estimate the interaction induced transition rate @xmath48 between unperturbed @xmath49 localized eigenstates .",
    "following @xcite let us assume that the distance between electrons @xmath50 is much larger than @xmath13 ( @xmath16 ) and their energy is in the middle of the band .",
    "in this case the two - body interaction has a dipole - dipole form since the lower order terms only slightly modify the one - particle effective potential .",
    "the two - body matrix element between noninteracting eigenstates is then @xmath51 , where we used that the dipole is of the order of @xmath13 ( electron can not jump on a distance larger @xmath13 due to exponential localization ) .",
    "the sum @xmath52 of the product of four random one - particle wave functions @xmath53 runs over @xmath54 sites for each electron so that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the density of directly coupled two electron states is @xmath57 and according to the fermi golden rule the hopping rate is @xmath58 .",
    "the mixing of two - electron levels takes place when @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the value of @xmath0 at the filling @xmath61 ( one electron in a box of size @xmath13 with @xmath62 ) ) . for @xmath63",
    "this mixing takes place at @xmath64 . in this sense",
    "the situation is qualitatively different from the case of short range interaction where the mixing is possible only for particles on a distance @xmath65 . for @xmath66",
    "the pair of two electrons becomes delocalized in a way similar to the 3d anderson transition .",
    "indeed , the center of mass can move in the 2d plane and in addition electrons can rotate around a ring of radius @xmath50 and width @xmath13 keeping their total energy @xmath67 constant . since @xmath68 the dynamics is going in an effective 3d space where the anderson transition to diffusion takes place at @xmath66 .",
    "formally , the diffusion of two electrons will be finally localized since the finite length of the ring makes the situation analogous to quasi-2d anderson model ( finite number of planes ) .",
    "however , the corresponding tip localization length @xmath69 jumps from @xmath70 at @xmath71 to exponentially large @xmath72 for @xmath66 . in a similar way for @xmath73",
    "coupled 2d anderson models the one - particle localization length @xmath13 makes a jump near the 3d transition point ( e.g. @xmath74 ) from @xmath75 to @xmath76 where the conductance @xmath77 . in the delocalized phase",
    "the diffusion rate or the conductivity in units @xmath78 can be estimated as @xmath79 .",
    "the above estimates show that the border between the insulating ( localized at @xmath80 ) and metallic ( delocalized at @xmath81 ) phases is : @xmath82 the physical meaning of this result is very natural : larger @xmath0 corresponds to a lower density @xmath7 with larger distance between electrons and smaller two - body interaction between them .",
    "the first numerical studies of two polarized electrons in 2d anderson model showed a transition in the level spacing statistics @xmath1 from the poisson distribution @xmath83 near the ground state to the wigner - dyson statistics @xmath84 at higher energies @xcite in a way similar to the results of shklovskii _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the 3d anderson model . in both cases",
    "the intermediate statistics @xmath1 are very close at the critical transition point ( fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical studies were done in the range of parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 ; more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "independent recent studies @xcite of a similar model with coulomb interaction at the center of the energy band also show a transition to @xmath84 as a function of @xmath38 . since even analytical formulas for the coulomb matrix element between localized states are absent further investigations of this problem are still needed .",
    "for numerical studies of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) we follow the approach developed in @xcite and rewrite the hamiltonian matrix in the basis of one particle eigenstates ( orbitals ) at @xmath37 using the computed two - body matrix elements between the orbitals .",
    "only a finite number @xmath73 of low energy orbitals has been considered and the final many - body hamiltonian matrix was constructed on the basis of a pyramid rule for the one - particle orbital index @xmath89 : @xmath90 .",
    "this procedure allows to make an efficient reduction of the resulting matrix size @xmath91 comparing to @xmath92 without any serious modification of the properties of low energy states . to the maximum we used @xmath93 corresponding to @xmath94 ( for @xmath2 we used up to @xmath95 ) .",
    "we checked that our results at low energy are not sensitive to the variation of @xmath73 and @xmath91 ( see the illustrations below ) .",
    "one of the main characteristics we extracted from the numerical studies is the level spacing statistics @xmath1 at a given total excitation energy @xmath96 measured from the ground state .",
    "the disorder average has been performed over @xmath97 realization ( for low @xmath96 ) and @xmath98 ( for higher @xmath96 ) . in this way , the total statistics used for @xmath1 varied from @xmath99 at low @xmath96 to @xmath100 at high @xmath96 . to study the variation of @xmath1 with the interaction or disorder strength it is convenient to use the parameter @xmath101 which is defined as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the smaller intersection point of @xmath83 and @xmath104 . in this way",
    "@xmath105 corresponds to @xmath83 and @xmath101=0 to @xmath104 .",
    "we remind that for the one - particle 3d anderson model the localized phase is characterized by @xmath105 , since localized ( nonergodic ) eigenstates do not feel each other , while in the metallic phase the eigenstates are extended and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "the results presented in @xcite show that at @xmath107 the parameter @xmath101 evolves to 1 for the total energy @xmath108 and 0 for @xmath109 with the growth of the system size @xmath28 at fixed filling @xmath110 .",
    "the critical energy @xmath111 and @xmath112 at which the transition takes place are @xmath113 , @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) and @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) with @xmath119 . for @xmath120",
    "no transition is found for @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "the new data for @xmath46 are presented in fig . 1 where the transition is seen at @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "at the critical point @xmath125 the spectral statistics @xmath1 is independent of the number of particles and the system size reached in our simulations ( see fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "in fig.2 we show an illustration that at low energy the parameter @xmath101 is not sensitive to the variation of the total matrix size @xmath91 by more than 3 times that confirms the validity of our numerical approach .",
    "we note that not only the values of @xmath101 are close for different @xmath91 but also the whole distributions @xmath1 , as it is illustrated in fig.3 for @xmath126 .    the results of fig .",
    "1 are obtained at fixed parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the variation of the spectral statistics @xmath1 at low energy for the change of @xmath0 from @xmath127 to @xmath128 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . these data demonstrate a clear approach to the poisson distribution with growing @xmath0 .",
    "the same tendency is seen in the @xmath101 dependence on energy shown at different @xmath0 in fig .",
    "4 . these results are in agreement with the relation ( 2 ) and the argument given in the previous section according to which at large @xmath0 the distance between electrons grows and the two - body interaction between them drops .",
    "since    only the interaction between two particles is able to mix many - body levels , the electron dynamics becomes nonergodic at large @xmath0 that leads to the poisson distribution .    at the same time even at the optimal values of @xmath129 the ergodicity and level mixing appear only at total energy @xmath109 while for @xmath108 including the ground state the ergodicity is absent in the range of parameters we studied .",
    "formally , one can object against the statement that the value @xmath105 implies the localization of electrons in space giving as a counterexample the case of noninteracting delocalized electrons in the metallic phase where also @xmath105 for the multi - electron spectrum .",
    "however , in the system we study all one - particle states are exponentially localized and it is very difficult to imagine that the interaction gives delocalization of charge , makes the system metallic and does not introduce complete ergodicity and level mixing , which should give @xmath106 instead of @xmath105 found for @xmath108 .",
    "due to this reason we consider that the appearance of poisson statistics near the ground state is the direct evidence of localization at @xmath108 . at the same time",
    "the emergence of random matrix statistics at @xmath109 implies ergodicity and delocalization for many electron states .",
    "this delocalization apparently appears in a way similar to the two electron delocalization discussed in the previous section but in addition the interaction between larger number of particles decreases the delocalization border comparing to the tip case discussed in @xcite .",
    "an interesting point is that the transition at @xmath130 takes place at zero temperature . indeed , according to the data of fig .",
    "1 at the transition the energy per particle @xmath131 is much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath132 showing that the data are close to the thermodynamic limit with @xmath133 .",
    "our results show that the coulomb interaction between two electrons in excited states leads to their delocalization for @xmath134 while for @xmath80 they remain localized .",
    "the transition between these phases is similar to the anderson transition in an effective dimension @xmath135 .",
    "the numerical studies of the spectral statistics for many polarized electrons in the 2d anderson model show that for @xmath136 and @xmath85 the ground state is nonergodic ( localized ) and is characterized by the poisson statistics for the total energy @xmath137",
    ". however , the transition to quantum ergodicity and the wigner - dyson statistics takes place at a fixed total energy @xmath111 independent of system size ( for @xmath138 , @xmath139 and fixed filling @xmath110 ) .",
    "this implies a delocalization at zero temperature @xmath12 . at the critical point",
    "@xmath111 the parameter @xmath112 increases with the disorder strength @xmath38 : @xmath140 and the critical statistics approaches to the poisson limit . in a certain sence",
    "the situation is similar to the anderson transition in high dimensions @xmath141 discussed in @xcite where also @xmath112 is growing with @xmath142 . in analogy with this result and the case of two electrons in 2d",
    "we make a conjecture that in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) the transition at @xmath111 is similar to a transition in some effective dimension @xmath143 .",
    "this @xmath144 is growing with the disorder strength @xmath38 .",
    "the interaction induced ergodicity at @xmath133 is in favor of the metal - insulator transition observed experimentally , especially in the view of recently observed metallic behavior for polarized electrons @xcite",
    ". however , our data are not sufficient to determine the behavior of resistivity on temperature in the ergodic phase at @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , it is not excluded that at strong disorder this ergodic phase will show a resistivity growth at low @xmath12 . in this case",
    "one can suppose that the ergodicity induced by the coulomb interaction is responsible for the phononless vrh conductivity as it was argued in @xcite and indicated by the experiments @xcite .",
