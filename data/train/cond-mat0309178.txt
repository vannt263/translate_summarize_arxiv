    "the isotropic heisenberg chain with integer spins has a finite excitation gap above a disordered ground state , while that with half - odd - integer spins has a gapless excitation from a critical ground state @xcite .",
    "this haldane conjecture based on the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath9 model with a topological term has been confirmed by extensive numerical and experimental studies .",
    "the elementary excitations of the @xmath0 isotropic heisenberg chain were investigated by inelastic neutron - scattering experiments . using @xmath0 quasi - one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite , the dynamical structure factors @xmath12 for the one - magnon mode and the multimagnon continuum were observed .",
    "the integrated @xmath12 with respect to @xmath13 at @xmath4 from the multimagnon mode was compared with the results obtained by several theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "the origin of the deviation was discussed in connection with the picture for the elementary excitation @xcite .",
    "after some years later from the haldane conjecture , affleck @xcite and affleck - haldane @xcite further applied the same analysis to the bond - alternating spin-@xmath14 heisenberg chain described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath15 and argued that there exist @xmath16 gapless points in @xmath17 . their argument was successfully confirmed by several theoretical methods @xcite . for the @xmath0 system",
    ", the critical @xmath18 separating the haldane phase @xmath19 and the singlet - dimer phase @xmath20 was estimated using a series expansion method @xcite , a density - matrix renormalization - group method @xcite , quantum monte carlo methods @xcite , the binder parameter combined with finite - size scaling @xcite , and a level - crossing method @xcite .",
    "the results are in agreement as @xmath21 . when @xmath22 in the @xmath0 system , on the other hand , the trivial dimer phase around @xmath23 is shown to be smoothly connected to the @xmath24 haldane phase which appears in the limit @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , using some nickel chain compounds which are regarded as the @xmath0 bond - alternating heisenberg system , magnetic susceptibility , magnetization , and esr measurements were performed @xcite . from the comparison between the experimental and numerical results ,",
    "the strength of the bond - alternation @xmath18 was evaluated and it was concluded that some compounds are in the singlet - dimer phase @xcite and the other compound is close to the gapless point @xcite .",
    "the elementary excitations of the @xmath0 bond - alternating heisenberg chain were investigated by a quantum monte carlo method @xcite and an exact diagonalization method @xcite . from the dispersion relation of the low - lying excitation , it was shown that the gap opens at the center of the brillouin zone for @xmath26 , while the gap opens at the boundary of the brillouin zone for @xmath27 . in the haldane phase around @xmath28 ,",
    "the low - lying excitations are expected to be scattering states of the domain walls in the hidden antiferromagnetic ordering @xcite . around @xmath29 , in contrast ,",
    "the low - lying excitations are well described by the @xmath0 magnon @xcite . in spite of these studies ,",
    "dynamical properties have not yet been fully investigated .",
    "a detailed investigation is desirable .    in this paper , we investigate dynamical properties of the @xmath0 bond - alternating heisenberg chain . using a continued fraction method based on the lanczos algorithm @xcite",
    ", we systematically calculate the dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) in the haldane phase and dimer phase including the regions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the dsf provides us with information about the intensity of the magnetic excitation as a function of energy - momentum transfer .",
    "since the dsf can be observed by inelastic neutron - scattering experiments , a comparison between theoretical and experimental results is possible .",
    "the setup of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly summarize the method for the numerical calculation . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the results for the distribution of the intensity as a function of energy - momentum transfer . using finite - size effects @xcite , we discuss whether the lowest excited states in given wave numbers form an isolated mode or a lower edge of the excitation continuum .",
    "iv is devoted to the summary of the paper .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 bond - alternating heisenberg chain described by the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "we set that the total number of spins is @xmath30 at the maximum and @xmath31 .",
    "we apply the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the dsf can be expressed in the form of the continued fraction @xcite as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the eigenstate with the lowest eigenvalue @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the lattice constant between neighboring two sites is set to unity .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 corresponds to the boundary of the brillouin zone . in the expression",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath39 is the static structure factor and @xmath40 is represented in the form of the continued fraction , which can be calculated numerically by lanczos algorithm .",
    "the total contribution of @xmath40 for fixed @xmath41 is normalized to unity , because the following sum rule has to be satisfied : @xmath42 . since rotational",
    "symmetry around @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 axes remains , @xmath46 .",
    "we thus calculate only @xmath47 . instead of taking @xmath48 , we set @xmath49 . for finite - size systems , therefore , @xmath50 consists of a finite number of lorentzians . following ref . 9",
    ", we call the position of a lorentzian and the integrated value of each lorentzian with respect to @xmath13 as the pole and residue , respectively .    to discuss whether the lowest excited states in given @xmath41 form an isolated mode or a lower edge of the excitation continuum in the thermodynamic limit , we investigate the finite - size effects of the poles and their residues of the continued fraction @xmath50 @xcite . as reported in refs . 9 and 30 - 32 , a pole",
    "which belongs to an excitation continuum tends to have an appreciable size dependence on at least either its position or its residue , while a pole which belongs to an isolated mode hardly depends on the system size .    using these methods , we proceed to the numerical calculation for the dsf and discuss characteristics of the low - lying excitation .",
    "we first investigate characteristics of the lowest excited state in a given @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "1 , the finite - size effects for the residues of the lowest excited states are shown in the extended zone scheme . note that the finite - size effects only for the residues are presented , since the positions of the poles scarcely depend on the system size . we discuss the results , making reference to the typical size dependence of the excitation continua for the @xmath51 @xcite and @xmath52 @xcite isotropic heisenberg chains .    in fig .",
    "2 , the dsf s of the haldane phase and the dimer phase are shown in the extended zone scheme .",
    "the intensity of @xmath53 is proportional to the area of the circle .",
    "the full circles represent the isolated mode and the gray circles represent the excitation continuum .",
    "the largest intensity in a given @xmath41 appears at the lowest excited state . in @xmath26",
    "it increases as @xmath41 approaches @xmath54 , while in @xmath27 it increases as @xmath41 approaches @xmath55 .      as @xmath56 increases , the residues at @xmath57 and @xmath58 decrease in @xmath59 and in @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the size dependence of the residues in both regions of wave numbers is quite similar to that for the excitation continua of the @xmath51 @xcite and @xmath52 @xcite isotropic heisenberg chains .",
    "the behavior of the residue around @xmath61 at @xmath62 is different from that in the other wave numbers .",
    "such size dependence is probably caused by the fact that the next lowest excited state around @xmath61 lies close to the lowest excited state with almost the same scattering intensity .",
    "therefore , the size dependence around @xmath61 suggests that the lowest excited states may become the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum .",
    "accordingly , at @xmath57 , the lowest excited states in @xmath63 become the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum , while those in @xmath64 form the one - magnon isolated mode . at @xmath62 ,",
    "the lowest excited states in @xmath65 become the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum , while those around @xmath4 form the one - magnon isolated mode .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the dsf at @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the extended zone scheme . the largest intensity caused by the one - magnon mode appears at @xmath4 .",
    "we evaluate its integrated intensity by extrapolating at @xmath66 .",
    "the ratio that the one - magnon mode carries at @xmath4 is @xmath67 in @xmath57 and @xmath68 in @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "these values are smaller than that in the @xmath0 haldane - gap system , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "therefore , as the system approaches the gapless point in the haldane phase , the one - magnon mode is reduced towards @xmath4 with decrease in the excitation gap and the scattering intensity at @xmath4 .    at @xmath70 ,",
    "the system is in the vicinity of the gapless point @xcite .",
    "the residues in @xmath71 decrease with increasing @xmath56 , indicating that the lowest excited states in @xmath72 form the lower edge of the excitation continuum .",
    "judging from the finite - size effects of the residues , the one - magnon isolated mode appears in @xmath73 at @xmath74 , while the lowest excited states form the one - magnon mode in @xmath72 at @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "as the system leaves from the gapless point in the singlet - dimer phase , the wave - number region of the one - magnon mode seems to extend towards @xmath4 . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the lowest excited states form the one - magnon mode in @xmath78 and the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum in @xmath6 .    at @xmath79 ,",
    "the system can be regarded as the @xmath24 haldane - gap system . from the finite - size effects of the residues , we find out that the one - magnon mode appears in @xmath7 , and the lowest excited states form the multimagnon continuum in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the integrated intensity of the one - magnon mode at @xmath38 is evaluated to be @xmath8 by extrapolating at @xmath66 .",
    "the integrated intensity that the one - magnon mode carries at the boundary of the brillouin zone in the @xmath24 haldane - gap systems is smaller than that in the @xmath0 haldane - gap system .    .",
    ", width=302 ]      we now investigate the observable dsf by inelastic neutron - scattering experiments .",
    "the excitation energies of the lowest excited states are summarized in table i. comparing the excitation energies at the symmetric wave numbers about @xmath38 , we discuss the dsf in the reduced zone scheme .    at @xmath57 and @xmath58 the excitation energies in @xmath80 lie below the corresponding ones in @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath57 , the lowest excited states in @xmath81 in the reduced zone scheme form the one - magnon isolated mode . at @xmath62 ,",
    "the lowest excited states around @xmath82 form the one - magnon isolated mode , while those in @xmath83 form the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum . the largest intensity caused by the one - magnon mode appears at @xmath82 with the integrated intensity @xmath84 in @xmath57 and @xmath85 in @xmath62 .    in the dimer phase ,",
    "the excitation energies take the same values at the symmetric wave numbers about @xmath38 within our numerical accuracy .",
    "thus , at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the lowest excited states in the reduced zone scheme form the one - magnon mode in @xmath81 . at @xmath74 and @xmath86 , the one - magnon mode coincides with the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum . in this case",
    ", the one - magnon mode may become unstable and only the multimagnon continuum emerges .",
    "in fact , it was observed by inelastic neutron - scattering experiments that , when the one - magnon mode crosses the multimagnon continuum , the large intensity of the one - magnon mode becomes invisible in the multimagnon continuum @xcite . at @xmath74 , therefore , the lowest excited states form the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum in @xmath81 . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the lowest excited states form the lower edge of the multimagnon continuum in @xmath5 and the one - magnon mode in @xmath87 .    at @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ", the one - magnon modes corresponding to the symmetric wave numbers coincide with each other . at @xmath77",
    ", there exists such region of the wave numbers . in these cases ,",
    "the intensity is described as the sum of two one - magnon modes .",
    "therefore , the largest intensity does not always appear at @xmath82 or @xmath55 in the reduced zone scheme . at @xmath75 and @xmath76 ,",
    "the intensity of the one - magnon mode increases as @xmath41 approaches 0 . at @xmath77 , in contrast , the largest intensity of the one - magnon mode emerges at @xmath88 .    at @xmath79",
    ", the multimagnon continuum appears in @xmath5 and the one - magnon mode appears in @xmath87 with the largest scattering intensity at @xmath38 .",
    "the wave - number region for the one - magnon mode is smaller than that in the @xmath0 haldane gap system @xcite .",
