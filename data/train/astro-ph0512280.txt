    "understanding the physical conditions in star forming regions at high redshift plays a crucial role in our ability to trace the evolution of star formation and the associated production of metals .",
    "unfortunately , it is exceedingly difficult to probe these regions using background quasars because of their compact size , and possible dust extinction .",
    "absorption studies of bright star forming galaxies ( e.g. , the lensed lyman break galaxy ms 1512@xmath9cb58 ; @xcite ) provide greater promise because they probe the regions where star formation is taking place , but even in these rare cases information is only available on the _ integrated _ properties and individual regions can not be probed .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , on the other hand , are known to be the end product of massive stars , and as a result their bright afterglows can be used to trace the interstellar medium of their host galaxies . more importantly , since grb progenitors are short - lived , they are likely to be buried within star - forming regions undergoing active star formation @xcite . as a result , grbs may provide an ideal direct probe of the physical conditions in high redshift star forming regions . over the last several years , and particularly with the advent of the _ swift _ satellite , several grb absorption spectra have been obtained revealing a large fraction of objects with unusually large neutral hydrogen column densities even for damped ly@xmath10 ( dla ) systems , @xmath11 @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it has been noted in several cases that the column densities of non - refractory elements ( e.g. , zn ) are higher than in qso - dlas , with a depletion pattern suggestive of a large dust content @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest that at least some grb - dlas are physically different from qso - dlas , and that they may represent individual star - forming regions with at least a modest dust obscuration .",
    "given the possible association with star - forming regions , several authors have also investigated the impact of the grb prompt and afterglow emission on the local environment , particularly in the context of dust destruction , photo - ionization , and dissociation and excitation of @xmath13 molecules @xcite .",
    "the basic conclusion of these studies is that bright afterglows are capable of significantly modifying their local environment on a scale of about @xmath14 cm .",
    "the detection of such effects can therefore provide a unique diagnostic of the immediate environment of the burst , and in addition may address the issue of relatively low dust extinction in grb optical afterglows .    in this _ letter _ we present a high - resolution absorption spectrum of , which reveals strong absorption features from and fine - structure states at a redshift @xmath0 .",
    "this is the first example of an extra - galactic sight line that reveals the full range of ground - level fine - structure transitions , suggesting that their excitation is intimately related to the burst environment or the burst itself .",
    "we investigate both possibilities and their implications in the following sections .",
    "was detected by  on 2005 november 11.250 ut @xcite , and the optical afterglow was discovered with the rotse - iiib robotic telescope 27 s after the burst with an unfiltered magnitude of about 13 @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations in the first hour after the burst indicate an optical flux evolution , @xmath15 @xmath16jy @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of  were initiated approximately 1 hr after the burst , using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) mounted on the keck i 10-m telescope @xcite .",
    "a total of 5400 s were obtained in three exposures using a @xmath17 wide slit .",
    "the wavelength range is @xmath18  .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the makee pipeline routines ( version 4.0.1 of may 2005 ) , which includes optimal extraction of orders , sky subtraction , and wavelength calibration from th - ar arc lamp exposures , including a heliocentric velocity correction .",
    "the orders within individual frames were traced using a median combined total of the exposures , and atmospheric absorption features were removed with the makee pipeline .",
    "a final resampling of the spectrum and continuum fitting was performed using the iraf task continuum .",
    "the spectrum reveals strong absorption features at a redshift , @xmath19 , which we interpret to arise in the host galaxy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a full analysis of the host galaxy and intervening absorption systems is presented in a companion paper ( penprase et al .",
    "2005 ) . here",
    "we focus on the detection of and fine - structure transitions .",
    "in figures  [ fig : fs][fig : fsiiii ] we plot the absorption profiles of all transitions of the ground and fine - structure states as a function of velocity relative to the systemic redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "the line identifications , observed wavelengths , and equivalent widths are summarized in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "also included in the table are the absorption lines from the ground - state and fine - strcuture level of .",
    "we detect absorption features from all four fine - structure levels of the @xmath20 level , ( * to * * * * ) , correspoding to @xmath21-values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption profiles exhibit a simple and symmetric velocity structure extending from about @xmath26 to @xmath27 km s@xmath2 and centered on the systemic velocity of the burst .",
    "strong lines of the ground - state level exhibit an overall velocity range of about @xmath28 to @xmath29 km s@xmath2 , but about @xmath30 of the gas is contained in the narrow velocity component ( @xcite , penprase et al .",
    "we interpret the dominant component to arise from the local environment of the burst based both on the kinematic coincidence and the unusual detection of fine - strcuture transitions .",
    "the detection of the full range of ground - level fine - structure states is highly unusual , and to our knowledge represents the first such example in an extra - galactic source . in the milky way",
    ", such transitions have been detected in the context of a few dense environments such as in the circumstellar disks around @xmath31 pictoris @xcite and 2 andromedae @xcite , and the hh 47a bow shock @xcite .",
    "absorption from * , on the other hand , is more prevalent and has been previously detected in several grb - dlas @xcite , as well as in the lensed lyman break galaxy ms 1512@xmath9cb58 @xcite , but not in any qso - dlas @xcite .",
    "this suggests that * may trace regions of intense star formation , which tend to be missed in quasar sight lines due to the cross - section selection effect or possibly the associated dust extinction .",
    "we measure the column densities of the various levels using the apparent optical depth method @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage that it makes no _ a priori _ assumptions about the functional form of the velocity distribution , and at the same time it incorporates information from a wide variety of lines with different oscillator strengths , allowing a robust measure of the column density in the line cores .",
    "the column densities derived from this method by integrating over the velocity range of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , as well as the ratios of the fine - structure levels compared to the ground state , are summarized in table  [ tab : columns ] .",
    "the excitation of the fine - structure levels can be achieved either by collisions with ambient electrons , or by radiative pumping due to a local radiation field .",
    "collisional excitation of into its fine - structure states has been studied by @xcite , and more recently by @xcite ; the latter authors also investigate the conditions for * collisional excitation . in figure",
    "[ fig : tne ] we plot contours of the observed ratios of fine - structure columns relative to the ground - state in the @xmath32 space , and find that the required electron density is at least @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , the detection of * * * * lines requires a temperature of at least @xmath35 k. taking into account all four ratios we find that the best - fit density and temperature are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we note , however , that the ratio of * to is about a factor of two lower than expected based on the ratios of the three other excited states .",
    "a more significant discrepancy is observed in the ratio of the * column relative to that of the ground state , @xmath38 .",
    "this is an upper limit since the single @xmath39 line detected in the spectrum is saturated .",
    "a comparison to other absorption features from which we can determine the doppler parameter @xmath40 ( penprase et al .",
    "2005 ) suggests that the ratio is about @xmath41 . using the analysis of @xcite we find that for the tempearure range of @xmath42 k , the observed ratio indicates an electron density of only @xmath43 @xmath34 .",
    "conversely , using the electron density inferred from the transitions we find an expected column density ratio for * of about @xmath44 , at least an order of magnitude larger than detected .    the significant difference in physical conditions derived from the and fine - strcuture absorption suggests that they either arise in different regions of the absorbing cloud , or that a different mechanism , namely radiative pumping is at play .",
    "we consider the former possibility unlikely since there is no clear reason why and should be segregated within the absorber , particularly in light of their similar velocity structure .      in the context of radiative",
    "pumping two possibilities exist .",
    "first , the fine - structure states can be directly excited by infra - red radiation .",
    "successive levels starting with * require energies of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 cm@xmath2 , respectively , for excitation .",
    "the * level requires an energy of @xmath50 cm@xmath2 . in the case of ir pumping the ratio of the fine - structure states relative to the ground state is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath51 where the number of photons at the appropriate excitation energy is , @xmath52    based on the observed column density ratios listed in table  [ tab : columns ] and the energies of the various excitation levels we infer the following specific intensities at the location of the and absorbers : @xmath53 these values roughly define a spectrum @xmath54 with a possible turn - over at @xmath55 hz .",
    "a second possibility is indirect uv pumping in which decays from short - lived excited uv levels populate the fine - structure levels in addition to the ground level .",
    "@xcite investigate this process for the ion and find that uv pumping dominates over collisional excitation as long as @xmath56 .",
    "a detailed investigation of this process for has not been performed to date .",
    "as discussed above , the mis - match in electron densities required to explain the observerd ratios of and fine - strcuture levels relative to the ground state suggest that collisional excitation is unlikely to be the source of the observed fine - structure population . in addition , we expect that if the excitation is due to electron collisions produced as a result of the grb shock wave , then the velocity widths of the fine - structure lines should be significantly broader than the observed @xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , excitation due to radiative pumping appears to be a more likely scenario . in this context",
    "it is instructive to consider two sources for the ir or uv photons : star formation and the grb afterglow itself .    in the context of ir emission from stars ,",
    "the inferred spectrum @xmath57 with a possible turn - over at @xmath55 hz may be indicative of a thermal spectrum with a peak of about @xmath58 k ( or greater if the turnover is not real ) , arising from dust re - radiation of absorbed star light .",
    "the much higher temperature compared to , for example , the ir emission from arp220 with @xmath59 k , as well as the required large luminosity , @xmath60 erg s@xmath2 hz@xmath2 ( approaching @xmath61 l@xmath62 ) , indicate an intense radiation field in the environment of  compared to those in local star - forming regions . the star formation rate required to produce the inferred luminosity is in excess of 100 m@xmath62 yr@xmath2 @xcite , and the high temperature requires a large fraction of hot ob stars and a large dust content .",
    "perhaps a similar analogue is the super star cluster in the dwarf galaxy ngc5253 ( @xmath63 l@xmath62 ) , which contains @xmath64 massive o stars within a region of @xmath65 pc .",
    "we note that if this is the correct scenario , then it is likely that the grb had to destroy dust along the line of sight in order for the optical afterglow to be detected on earth .    in the context of uv radiative pumping the condition @xmath66 for * excitation",
    "described in ",
    "[ sec : rad ] may be satisfied in the vicinity ( @xmath67 pc ) of ob stars @xcite .",
    "thus , a large concentration of such stars may lead to the observed * column density .",
    "the conditions for uv pumping of fine - structure states have not been investigated previously and are beyond the scope of this paper , but we expect that a more intense uv radiation field is required for excitation of * * * * compared to * . given that uv and ir pumping require similar star formation conditions , it is likely that both mechanisms operate within the star - forming region .    finally , it is possible that the radiative pumping is due to the grb afterglow emission . in this context",
    "we use the observed flux of the afterglow , @xmath68 mjy in the first hour , along with the ir fluxes inferred in  [ sec : rad ] , to find that the burst - absorber distance is about @xmath69 pc , which is reasonable for the size of a star - forming region . on the other hand , it is difficult to reconcile the observed shape of the spectrum ( @xmath70 ) with that of a grb afterglow ( @xmath71 ) , unless the excitation takes place in different layers within the absorber . in the case of uv pumping by the grb afterglow",
    "we find that for the observed flux this process dominates over collisional excitation within a region of about 10 pc unless the electron density exceeds @xmath72 @xmath34 .",
    "one possibility in the case of excitation by the grb and afterglow radiation is that the line strengths will change as a function of time .",
    "we repeated the column density calculation for each individual exposure and found no significant evolution from @xmath73 to 2.2 hours after the burst .",
    "the high - resolution spectrum of  reveals a wide range of absorption features from fine - structure states of and at @xmath0 .",
    "we associate the absorption with the local environment of the burst based on the fact that the excitation of these fine - structure states requires large densities or intense ir / uv radiation fields , which are not common in typical interstellar environments .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the kinematic coincidence with the burst systemic redshift .",
    "a comparison of the conditions required to excite the and fine - structure levels indicates that collisional excitation is not likely to be the dominant mechanism , unless the two ions are segregated in different regions of the absorber .",
    "a more likely mechanuism is direct ir pumping or indirect uv pumping . in this scenario",
    "we find that if the radiation field is due to star formation activity in the burst environment , then this requires a large concentration of several thousand ob stars in a compact region ( @xmath74 pc ) , perhaps reminiscent of the super star cluster in the dwarf galaxy ngc5253 .",
    "if the uv and/or ir radiation are supplied by the grb , on the other hand , then the distance to the absorber is likely to be about @xmath69 pc .",
    "this is consistent with calculations by @xcite , which indicate that within @xmath75 pc , the burst will ionize its environment , leading to a very low column of low - ionization states such as and ; outside of this region it is likely that and survive and may be excited to fine - structure levels instead .",
    "clearly , detailed radiative transfer calculations , along with refined calculations of fine - structure excitation , are required in order to distinguish between the different scenarios .",
    "still , regardless of the exact details it is clear that grb afterglows allow us to directly probe the conditions within individual star forming regions , and may therefore provide direct information on the mode of star formation across a wide redshift range .",
    "the absorption spectrum of  seems to indicate that compact , dusty , and dense star forming regions may be prevalent , at least in the context of grb progenitor formation .",
