    "brownian motion is a model of thermal fluctuations of small particles .",
    "if a particle moves according to such fluctuations , it is known to undergo undirected movement , i.e.  brownian motion is a martingale .",
    "however , the idea to use random fluctuations in order to force a particle in one direction is tempting and led to the paradox of the brownian ratchet as introduced by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 46 ) .",
    "quantitative models of brownian ratchets for biological mechanisms were introduced in @xcite and @xcite . while the _ polymerisation ratchet _ serves as a model of growth of polymers against a barrier , we focus on the _ translocation ratchet _ , a model for protein transport .",
    "here , a polymer moves _ in _ and _ out _ through a nanopore by thermal fluctuations . on the _ in_-side of the nanopore",
    ", molecules may bind to the polymer and bound sites along the polymer are forbidden to move through the nanopore ; see figure [ fig : illu ] for an illustration .",
    "a prominent example of a translocation ratchet was suggested on the basis of empirical data for prepro-@xmath8 factor as protein and bip as the ratcheting molecule by @xcite : after translation , proteins have to be transported into the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum ( er ) where they are e.g.  cut and folded in order to function properly . in general , such ratcheting molecules can be chaperones which bind to the translocated protein _",
    "in_-side the er lumen .",
    "the resulting translocation ratchet has been studied and compared to data from @xcite by @xcite and @xcite . in these models , a discrete set of sites",
    "_ in_-side the er lumen is either bound or unbound with bip .",
    "the protein diffuses to either side of the nanopore with equal chances .",
    "each unbound site of the protein may become bound by bip and each bound bip molecule may dissociate from the prepro-@xmath8 factor . finally , when the protein is completely _",
    "in_-side the er lumen , it is released . in mathematical models of",
    "_ translocation ratchets _",
    ", several parameters have to be specified : the distance of sites along the protein which can be either bound or unbound with ratcheting molecules ; the rate and location of association and rate of dissociation of ratcheting molecules .",
    "the case of a large association rate and a fixed distance of possible ratcheting sites was studied in @xcite .",
    "( this ratchet is similar to the polymerisation ratchet of @xcite . )",
    "@xcite obtain a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the speed of protein translocation if the protein diffuses through a brownian motion with drift . in the present paper ,",
    "we study a translocation ratchet for a continuum of possible ratcheting sites , in the limit of small ratcheting molecules , small dissociation rates and long proteins . in this model",
    ", we can compute a law of large numbers ( theorem [ t : lln ] ) and a central limit theorem ( theorem [ t : clt ] ) for the speed of protein translocation .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )       the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : model - results ] we introduce our model and give the main results , the law of large numbers ( theorem [ t : lln ] ) and the central limit theorem ( theorem [ t : clt ] ) . in section [ sec : appl ]",

    "we study a _ translocation ratchet _ similar to the model by @xcite and @xcite using the following assumptions : ( i ) the protein moves _ in _ and _ out _ with equal probabilities ; ( ii ) the protein movement is reflected at bound ratcheting molecules ; ( iii ) the protein has a continuum of sites to which ratcheting molecules can bind ; ( iv ) the dissociation rate of ratcheting molecules from the protein is much smaller than their binding rate to the protein ; ( v ) the ratcheting molecules are infinitely small ; ( vi ) the protein is infinitely long .    in mathematical terms",

    "the process @xmath12 is reflected brownian motion , where the reflection point at time @xmath11 is @xmath2 .",
    "this reflection point @xmath2 increases with @xmath11 : given that the value of @xmath13 at time @xmath11 is @xmath14 , @xmath2 jumps to a uniformly chosen value @xmath15 $ ] at rate @xmath16 for some @xmath17 .",

    "since @xmath26 is non - decreasing and @xmath28 , the process @xmath19 also tends to grow .",
    "we immediately formulate our main results concerning the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the speed of @xmath19 :    [ t : lln ] let @xmath29 be the @xmath7-brownian ratchet started in @xmath30 . then , @xmath31 almost surely , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the gamma function .",

    "[ rem : thm ] the proof of theorems [ t : lln ] and [ t : clt ] relies on several ingredients which we will provide in sections [ sec : graph - repr ] , [ sec : invar - distr ] and [ sec : regen - struct ] , respectively .",
    "first ( see section [ sec : graph - repr ] ) , the process @xmath13 can be constructed graphically by a one - dimensional ( non - reflecting ) brownian motion and an independent poisson process on @xmath46 with intensity @xmath7 . from this graphical construction , it becomes clear that the speed of @xmath5 , i.e. , the limit of @xmath47 , must be proportional to @xmath6 , if it exists .",
    "in addition , the graphical construction shows that @xmath48 $ ] does not depend on @xmath7 ; see remark [ rem : graph1 ] .",
    "second , to compute a candidate for the asymptotic speed @xmath49 , we study the markov chain @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the jump times of @xmath53 ( see section  [ sec : invar - distr ] ) . in particular , we show that this markov chain has a unique invariant distribution and ( as shown in section [ sec : proof ] ) the asymptotic speed is the ratio of expectations of @xmath54 and @xmath55 under the invariant distribution , which are computed in proposition  [ p : incrinv ] .",
    "third , we find a renewal structure for the process @xmath24 where renewal points @xmath56 are given by times @xmath11 where @xmath57 and between @xmath58 and @xmath59 a jump of @xmath26 has occurred ( see section  [ sec : regen - struct ] ) .",
    "using this renewal structure , we can show existence for the speed of @xmath5 and use a central limit theorem for cumulative processes in order to prove theorem  [ t : clt ] .",
    "we describe possible extensions of the @xmath7-brownian ratchet some of which already appeared in the literature .",
    "moreover , we give biological interpretations of our findings .",
    "[ rem:31 ] modelling protein translocation by ratcheting mechanisms has started with @xcite and @xcite .",

    "_ dissociation of ratcheting molecules _ : in the original approach of @xcite , there is a finite set of equally spaced ratcheting sites along the protein .",
    "there are two rates which describe binding and dissociation of ratcheting molecules from the protein .",
    "in particular , the case of infinite rates with a constant ratio can be studied , which leads to an effective speed by assuming that each ratcheting site has a certain probability of being bound independent of all others .",
