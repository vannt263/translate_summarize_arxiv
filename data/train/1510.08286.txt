    "the general formula vo@xmath0 ( n - a positive or negative integer ) represents all known vanadium oxides .",
    "the monovalent members of the family with n=1 ( vo ) and n=-2 ( v@xmath15o@xmath9 ) are metallic and semiconducting at all temperatures , respectively .",
    "the monovalent oxides with n=2 ( v@xmath15o@xmath8 ) and n=@xmath1 ( vo@xmath15 ) and the mixed valent oxides with n=3 - 6 , 8 , 9 and -6 , undergo metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) accompanied by structural transitions , at various temperatures , t@xmath2 , below and above room temperature .",
    "the mixed valence compounds with positive n belong to the so - called magneli phases and those with negative n - to wadsley phases . these transitions , including the absence of a transition for n=7 ,",
    "have attracted attention over many decades .",
    "one of the subjects under debate for more than half a century , was the role of the electron - electron ( mott - like ) and electron - phonon ( peierls - like ) interactions in these transitions @xcite .",
    "along with the eforts to understand the nature of these phase transitions there have been several attempts to find a systematic behavior of t@xmath2 as function of n. in 1971 , when only the t@xmath2 of the magneli phases with n=4 - 8 were known , nagasawa showed that ( 1 ) magneli phases are classified into two groups by the transition temperatures in which one has even n and the other odd n and ( 2 ) transition temperatures decrease with the increase of even and odd n ( the line for the two odd n lies below that connecting the three for even n ) . in 1980",
    "@xcite , using data from references @xcite for n@xmath188 we showed that t@xmath2 plotted versus 1/n lie on , or close to several straight lines as shown below :    \\(a ) t@xmath2=t@xmath2(@xmath19)(1 - 1/n ) for n= 1 , 2 , 4 and @xmath1 ,    \\(b ) t@xmath2=t@xmath2(@xmath20(1 - 3/n ) for n=5 , 6 and @xmath1 ,    \\(c ) t@xmath2=t@xmath2(@xmath20(7/n-1 ) for n=3 , 4 , 5 and 7 .    where t@xmath2(@xmath1)=t@xmath2(vo@xmath15 ) .",
    "note that the lines ( a ) and ( c ) cross at 1/n=1/4 and that the lines ( a ) and ( b ) meet at 1/n=0 .",
    "the then available data hinted at the existence of another simple line , ( d ) t@xmath2=t@xmath2(@xmath20(1 - 7/n ) ( the reflection of ( c ) about the vertical axis 1/n=1/7 ) for n=7 , 8 and @xmath1 , but the discrepancy of the data point for n=8 was far too large in view of the close agreement of the points in ( a ) - ( c ) . at that time , the metallic nature of vo was still problematic , its non - metallic conductivity being governed by the large concentration of native defects . in 2007",
    "experimental and computational evidences were presented in support of vo being a strongly correlated metal @xcite . the attempt to include the solitary data point with negative n ( n=-6 ) in the systematics",
    "is ignored here .",
    "the renewed inspection of the systematics was motivated by later reports in the literature , including t@xmath2(v@xmath11o@xmath14 ) @xcite which strengthened confidence in the previously reported systematics .",
    "two questions were asked at this stage : 1 .",
    "how valid are these simple lines ?",
    "2 . if they are valid , what do they imply ?    in order to answer the first question , a wide spread of t@xmath2(x ) data , where x=2 - 1/n , obtained over the years by many groups from electrical and magnetic measurements were tabulated and plotted ; these data include thermal hysteresis and experimental errors .",
    "appendix a is devoted to the verification of these lines .    the so proven validity of the data used in references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and the present understanding in the field allowed a revision of the interpretation of t@xmath2 that simplified the systematics to being expressed by only two straight lines .",
    "the transition temperatures of the vanadium oxides shown in table i were taken mainly from reference @xcite ; the data missing in that early article were filled in from more recent publications .",
    "graphs of t@xmath2(x ) using data from this table appear in research articles and reviews related to vo@xmath21 such as @xcite . a similar graph including also the datum for v@xmath11o@xmath14 as in @xcite , is shown in fig . 1 where the primary and secondary horizontal axes have been extended to x=1 and n=1",
    "solid lines connect the data points as in the above references .",
    "the four dashed straight lines which in part overlap with the solid lines represent ( a ) - ( d ) , their expressions shown in the previous section .",
    "the datum for v@xmath11o@xmath14 was available in 1981 but was ignored in literature until 2013 . as in @xcite , the point for v@xmath12o@xmath13 deviates significantly from line ( d ) and that for v@xmath8o@xmath9 deviates slightly from line ( c ) ( 430 k instead of 453 k ) .    the most interesting pair of lines in fig .",
    "1 is of course the ( c ) - ( d ) pair , for which t@xmath2=@xmath22340(7/n-1)k ; these two lines contain most of the data points for t@xmath2 from n=3 to n=@xmath1 .",
    "thus , _ if the line representing t@xmath2=340(1 - 7/n)k and the points laying on it ( including that for n=8 ) are rotated around the horizontal axis , all the points of the ( c ) - ( d ) pair lie now on a single straight line with the point for n=8 close to it .",
    "_ this simple transformation leaves out two points on what previously was line ( a ) ( 1/n=1/2 and 1 ) and one point on the former line ( b ) ( n=1/6 ) .",
    "if the point for n=1/6 is reflected about the horizontal axis we obtain a new straight line that connects the points for 1/n=1/2 , 1/n=1/6 and 1/n=0 .",
    "it turns out that the ordinate of the new graph represents the difference between two functions , while that of the old graph represents the absolute value of this difference . and",
    "indeed , the zero for v@xmath3o@xmath4 is not a minimum but a crossover point .",
    "the most suitable names for the two functions are t@xmath5 and t@xmath6 ( m for mott and p for peierls ) .",
    "the data points in fig . 2 represent t@xmath5 - t@xmath6 versus 1/n for all v@xmath23o@xmath24 with n@xmath251 ; the solid lines are the fitted linear trendlines with their patterson correlation coefficients .",
    "the dashed lines represent the ideal relations t@xmath5 - t@xmath6 = 340(7/n -1)k and t@xmath5 - t@xmath6 = 340(3/n-1)k .",
    "the upper dashed line is distinguishable but still very close to the solid line .",
    "the lower dashed line is indistinguishable on the scale of fig .",
    "2 , it overlaps the corresponding solid line .",
    "the point for n=1 ( vo ) remains isolated ; the extrapolation of line ( a ) in fig .",
    "1 to 0 for n=1 is not understood .",
    "the discussion on the mit in v@xmath23o@xmath24 is based on essentials of the state of the art of this topic as described in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rutile vo@xmath15 structure contains pairs of translationally distinct but symmetry equivalent , parallel , infinite chains of edge sharing octahedra . in v@xmath23o@xmath24 the chains are broken into n - octahedra long units ; the symmetry is broken in such a way that rutile - like chain fragments are connected by corundum - like ( v@xmath15o@xmath8-like ) chain ends .",
    "the two parallel chains become symmetry inequivalent and are denoted in @xcite as `` a '' and `` b '' . theoretical calculations for several v@xmath23o@xmath24 compounds @xcite showed that electron - lattice interactions are largest in the centers of the chain - fragments while electron - electron interactions are largest at the fragments ends .",
    "recent experiments @xcite confirm the importance of electron - electron correlations in v@xmath8o@xmath9 ( the highest point of fig .",
    "2 ) . with increasing n the electron - lattice interaction increases while the electron - electron interaction decreases .",
    "the absence of transition in v@xmath3o@xmath4 is probably due to mutual cancelation . for v@xmath15o@xmath8 t@xmath5 @xmath25 t@xmath6 ; this is not surprising since this material was originally considered a canonical mott system .",
    "the location of vo@xmath15 at the bottom of fig .",
    "2 is also not surprising ; the structural ordering and pairing at low temperatures imply a dominant peierls instability .",
    "the initial systematics presented in the introduction consisted of the three straight lines ( a ) - ( c ) and hinted at line ( d ) symmetrical to ( c ) . the updated point for",
    "v@xmath11o@xmath14 validated line ( d ) and enabled reduction to two lines to represent the systematics of t@xmath2(1/n ) .",
    "the splitting into two lines occurs between v@xmath15o@xmath8 and v@xmath8o@xmath9=v@xmath15o@xmath8+vo@xmath15 .",
    "t@xmath2(v@xmath8o@xmath9 ) and ( t@xmath5 - t@xmath6)(v@xmath8o@xmath9 ) ) are much higher than those of the constituents .",
    "we suggest that this is due to the presence of interfaces between v@xmath15o@xmath8 and vo@xmath15 .",
    "there are now many examples in the literature showing that the properties of double- , or multi - layers deviate strongly from those of the constituents due to the interface(s ) .",
    "once the interfaces between v@xmath15o@xmath8 and vo@xmath15 are formed , the addition of rutile fragments allows for a monotonic ( linear ) variation of ( t@xmath5 - t@xmath6)(1/n ) .",
    "rather surprising is the location of the point for v@xmath16o@xmath17 : why should the point for this compound `` leave its neighbors '' and `` join '' instead the straight line connecting v@xmath9o@xmath26 to vo@xmath15 in fig . 1 and then fit exactly on the line connecting v@xmath15o@xmath8 to vo@xmath15 in fig .",
    "2 ? a hint is provided by the very different dependencies on n of the _ a _ and _ b _ parameters ( of chains a and b ) as shown in fig . 6 of ref . @xcite . above n=3 , in both the strong and weak electron - electron interaction regimes _ a _ decreases monotonically with increasing x=2 - 1/n ; the accompanying behavior of _ b _ is at first a weak and then an accelerated decrease until x=1.83 is reached ; above this point _",
    "b _ increases linearly with x towards x=2 ( for vo@xmath15 ) ; a v - shaped _",
    "a_(x ) feature is formed with the tip at n=6 ( x=1.83 ) .",
    "electronic structure calculations @xcite show that electron - electron interactions are stronger in the b chain leading to localization that inhibits electron - lattice coupling .",
    "it is possible that the sudden jump of the data point for v@xmath16o@xmath17 out of the upper line in fig . 2",
    "is correlated with the structural anomaly of _",
    "b_(x ) ; however the exact fit to the lower line is puzzling and requires a stronger argument .",
    "if indeed the jump of the data point for v@xmath8o@xmath9 above that for v@xmath15o@xmath8 is due to an interface effect , the question now is why does this effect disappear completely in the case of v@xmath16o@xmath17 ?",
    "the systematics of t@xmath2 of vo@xmath0 as function of n for @xmath27 proposed in 1980 @xcite is revisited here .",
    "the renewed interest was motivated by a crucial datum that was not available at that time and by the advances in the understanding of the mit in this family of oxides . these lead to a simplified systematics expressed by two simple expressions ; one is t@xmath5-t@xmath6= t@xmath7(7/n-1 ) for v@xmath8o@xmath9 , v@xmath10o@xmath3 , v@xmath9o@xmath11 , v@xmath3o@xmath4 , v@xmath12o@xmath13 , v@xmath11o@xmath14 and vo@xmath15 and the other is t@xmath5-t@xmath6= t@xmath7(3/n-1 ) for v@xmath15o@xmath8 , v@xmath16o@xmath17 and vo@xmath15 where t@xmath2 is the absolute value of t@xmath5-t@xmath6 .",
    "these two expressions emphasize the smooth transition from a mott - like to a peierls - like regime of the mit in this family of materials .",
    "the linearity of the difference of the two functions in 1/n , and the existence of two lines , not one , are very intriguing and should be derived from theoretical calculations .",
    "most data used in @xcite are based on table ii ( magnetic measurements ) of @xcite while data in table i of that report ( electrical measurements ) include thermal hysteresis .",
    "measurements of t@xmath2 of the vanadium oxides have been carried out by many groups .",
    "their data are represented in some cases by a single number , but in most cases by a range of temperatures which include thermal hysteresis or / and experimental error . in order to answer question 1 . above",
    "we collated data for t@xmath2(n ) starting from 1936 ( see table ii ) .",
    "the limiting temperatures of the transitions either determined by hysteresis or by experimental error are plotted in fig .",
    "3 , by open circles for v@xmath12o@xmath13 and by full circles for all other oxides .",
    "a straight line was fitted to the data points of each of the four groups of oxides ( a ) - ( d ) .",
    "the resulting equations and patterson correlation coefficients ( r@xmath28 ) are shown below :    ( a ) t@xmath2 = 337.3(1 - 1.02/n)k for 1/n = 1 , 1/2 , 1/4 and 0 , r@xmath28=0.993    ( b ) t@xmath2 = 339.4(1 - 2.98/n)k for 1/n = 1/5 ,",
