    "e.g. ronkin [ ron , ch.i ,  5 ] or lelong and gruman [ lg , appendix i , proposition i.14 ] ) it follows that the function @xmath632 defined in ( [ 6.25 ] ) is subharmonic and that for each @xmath46 the function @xmath633 defined in ( [ 6.23 ] ) is also subharmonic . since the family @xmath634 increases monotonically with @xmath635 , the function @xmath636 defined in ( [ 6.24 ] ) is the upper envelope of this family .",
    "the function @xmath636 is not necessarily subharmonic but its regularization @xmath637 which is defined by @xmath638 turns out to be subharmonic ( see ronkin [ ron , ch.i ,  5 ] , lelong and gruman [ lg , appendix i , proposition i.25 ] , cartan [ car ] ) .",

    "the application of the recently created complex potential theory , in particular the analogue of h. cartan s theorem for the upper envelope of a family of plurisubharmonic functions ( see bedford and taylor [ bt , section 7 ] and sadullaev s survey paper [ sad ] ) enables one to derive results on families of matrix - valued functions of a more general type , namely on families which depend holomorphically on @xmath647 variables where @xmath648 .",

    "<S> a theory of matrix - valued functions from the matricial smirnov class @xmath0 is systematically developed . in particular , the maximum principle of v.i.smirnov , inner - outer factorization , the smirnov - beurling characterization of outer functions and an analogue of frostman s theorem are presented for matrix - valued functions from the smirnov class @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a family @xmath1 of functions belonging to the matricial smirnov class which is indexed by a complex parameter @xmath2 . we show that with the exception of a  very small  set of such @xmath2 the corresponding inner factor in the inner - outer factorization of the function @xmath3 is a blaschke - potapov product .    </S>",
