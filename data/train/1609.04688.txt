    "<S> the current status of the phenomenology of short - baseline neutrino oscillations induced by light sterile neutrinos in the framework of 3 + 1 mixing is reviewed .    </S>",
    "<S> the current experimental and theoretical research of the physics of massive neutrinos is based on the standard paradigm of three - neutrino ( @xmath0 ) mixing which describes the oscillations of neutrino flavors measured in solar , atmospheric and long - baseline experiments @xcite . in this framework , the three left - handed active neutrino fields @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are unitary linear combinations of three left - handed massive neutrino fields @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 with respective masses @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 : @xmath10 for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 unitary mixing matrix . </S>",
    "<S> there are two independent squared - mass differences : the small solar squared - mass difference @xmath14 and the larger atmospheric squared - mass difference @xmath15 with @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> although the standard @xmath0 framework is very successful at explaining the currently well - established neutrino data , it is interesting to explore non - standard effects in neutrino oscillations , which are expected from the new physics beyond the standard model . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we consider the current short - baseline neutrino oscillation anomalies and we discuss their explanation in the framework of the 3 + 1 mixing scheme . </S>",
    "<S> there are three short - baseline neutrino oscillation anomalies :    1 .   the lsnd observation of a short - baseline excess of @xmath17-induced events in a @xmath18 beam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the gallium neutrino anomaly @xcite , consisting in a short - baseline disappearance of @xmath19 measured in the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex @xcite and sage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite , which is a deficit of the rate of @xmath17 observed in several short - baseline reactor neutrino experiments in comparison with that expected from the calculation of the reactor neutrino fluxes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a neutrino oscillation explanation of these anomalies requires the existence of at least one additional squared - mass difference @xmath20 which is much larger than @xmath21 and requires the existence of at least one massive neutrino @xmath22 in addition to the three standard massive neutrinos @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( see the review in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . since from the lep measurement of the invisible width of the @xmath26 boson </S>",
    "<S> we know that there are only three active neutrinos , in the flavor basis the additional massive neutrinos correspond to sterile neutrinos @xcite , which do not have standard weak interactions .    in the general case of @xmath27 massive neutrinos , the mixing of the three active neutrino fields which are observable through weak interactions is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mixing ] ) with @xmath28 and @xmath12 is a @xmath29 rectangular mixing matrix which is obtained by keeping only the first three rows of a unitary @xmath30 unitary matrix . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the mixing of the standard active neutrinos with the non - standard massive neutrinos must be very small , in order not to spoil the successful @xmath0 mixing explanation of solar , atmospheric and long - baseline neutrino oscillation measurements @xcite : @xmath31 in other words , the non - standard massive neutrinos must be mostly sterile .    </S>",
    "<S> in this review we consider the so - called 3 + 1 scheme in which there is a non - standard massive neutrino ( mostly sterile ) at the ev scale which generates the new squared - mass difference in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sbl ] ) and the three standard massive neutrinos are much lighter than the ev scale is obtained with a very light ( or massless ) non - standard neutrinos and the three standard massive neutrinos have almost degenerate masses at the ev scale , because this possibility is strongly disfavored by cosmological measurements @xcite and by the experimental bounds on neutrinoless double-@xmath32 decay if the massive neutrinos are majorana particles ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . ] . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize that the 3 + 1 mixing scheme must be considered as effective , in the sense that the existence of more non - standard massive neutrinos is allowed , as long as their mixing with the three active neutrinos is sufficiently small to be negligible in the analysis of the data of current experiments .    in the case of 3 + 1 neutrino mixing @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation probabilities of the flavor neutrinos in short - baseline experiments are given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the source - detector distance and @xmath36 is the neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation amplitudes depend only on the absolute values of the elements in the fourth column of the mixing matrix : @xmath37 hence , even if there are cp - violating phases in the mixing matrix , cp violation can not be measured in short - baseline experiments . however , the effects of the non - standard cp - violating phases are observable in the experiments sensitive to the oscillations generated by the smaller squared - mass differences @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath38 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the same elements of the mixing matrix of the different amplitudes of the oscillations in short - baseline appearance and disappearance experiments generates the appearance - disappearance constraint @xcite @xmath39    the most recent global fits of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data @xcite indicate that the most likely values of the 3 + 1 mixing parameters lie in a region around @xmath40    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     because of the scarcity of sensitive data , of the possible existence of unknown systematic errors , and of the appearance - disappearance tension , the possible existence of light sterile neutrinos at the ev scale is controversial and needs new reliable experimental checks . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , there is an impressive program of new experiments which are planned to check the existence of ev sterile neutrinos ( see the reviews in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . figure  [ fig : future ] shows a comparison of the sensitivities of future experiments with the prglo allowed regions of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prglo ] for @xmath41 transitions ( sbn @xcite , nuprism @xcite , jsns@xmath42 @xcite ) , @xmath43 disappearance ( cesox @xcite , best @xcite , isodar@kamland @xcite , isodar@c - ads @xcite , danss @xcite , neos @xcite , neutrino-4 @xcite , prospect @xcite , solid @xcite , stereo @xcite , katrin @xcite ) , and @xmath44 disappearance ( sbn @xcite , kpipe @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , light sterile neutrinos have important effects that could be observed in @xmath32 decay experiments @xcite , in neutrinoless double-@xmath32 decay experiments @xcite , in solar neutrino experiments @xcite , in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , in atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite , in supernova neutrino experiments @xcite , in indirect dark matter detection @xcite ) , in high - energy cosmic neutrinos experiments @xcite , and in cosmology ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally emphasize that the discovery of the existence of sterile neutrinos would be a major discovery which would have a profound impact not only on neutrino physics , but on our whole view of fundamental physics , because sterile neutrinos are elementary particles beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of light sterile neutrinos would prove that there is new physics beyond the standard model at low - energies and their properties can give important information on this new physics ( see refs .  </S>",
