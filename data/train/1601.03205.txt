    "such an approach facilitates the analysis of the exchange interactions taking the dynamical coulomb correlations into account.@xcite recently , a general technique to extract the complete set of the magnetic couplings by taking into account the vertices of two - particle green s functions and non - local self - energies was developed in ref ..    by construction the methods reviewed above assume some type of the magnetic ordering in the system . however , there are examples when the resulting exchange interactions are very sensitive to the particular magnetic configuration.@xcite thus one may obtain different sets of the magnetic couplings for the same system .",

    "one can still use the pure spin model with parameters defined from the high - order strong coupling expansion within perturbative continuous unitary transformations.@xcite    in turn , the simulation of the exchange interactions in high - temperature paramagnetic phases can be performed by means of the dynamical mean - field theory and its extension .",

    "here is the number of the eigenstates of the heisenberg hamiltonian ( @xmath24 denotes the number of sites in the model ) .",
    "the same idea is used when analyzing the contribution of the first order on @xmath16 to the spin - spin correlation function that carries the information concerning the exchange interaction between the spins , @xmath25    this high - temperature decomposition of the spin - spin correlation function was used by the authors of ref . to obtain the expression for the curie - weiss temperature .",

    "the high - energy part of the hubbard spectrum describing the charge excitations is excluded from the consideration . for each eigenstate",
    "we measure the correlation between two spins .",
    "such a correlation can be positive or negative depending on the spin configuration encoded in the eigenstate and is multiplied by the excitation energy with respect to the ground state with @xmath42 .",
    "the expression for the exchange interaction eq.([eq : j ] ) was obtained by comparing the spin - spin correlation functions of the heisenberg and hubbard models in the limit @xmath34 . despite of this , in some cases the calculated exchange interactions , as we will show below , lead to good agreement of the heisenberg and hubbard eigenvalue spectra even for @xmath43 .",
    "importantly , one can analyze the magnetic interactions in the strongly correlated regime .    for transition metal oxides the typical ratio between hopping integral and on - site coulomb interaction is of order of 0.03 .",
    "it was shown that in case of @xmath44 iridium oxides @xcite this value can be about two times larger , 0.07 and the implementation of the ordinary superexchange theory is questionable .",
    "the simulation of the magnetic interaction in metallic systems is another complicated problem , we deal with the situation when the hopping integrals are of the same order of magnitude as the coulomb interaction .    in the case of the many - band hubbard model the spin operator of the i@xmath30 site in eq.([eq : j ] ) can be written as the sum of the orbital contributions , @xmath45 .",
