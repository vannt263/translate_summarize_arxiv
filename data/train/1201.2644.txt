    "dark matter ( dm ) and electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) are one of the most important areas of research in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "one of the main goal of lhc is to discover the higgs boson and hence provide the information about the ewsb mechanism .",
    "a dm particle is expected to be a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with mass around ewsb scale . in sm",
    "the ewsb is achieved by a higgs doublet developing a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "inert higgs doublet model ( ihdm ) is a very simple extension of the sm proposed by deshpande and ma @xcite to explain dm .",
    "ihdm is basically a two higgs doublet model with imposed @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "ihdm due to the imposed @xmath33 symmetry exhibits very interesting phenenomenology .",
    "it predicts the existence of a heavy scalar field as a wimp candidate .",
    "the rich phenomenology of ihdm had been extensively discussed in the context of dm phenomenology @xcite , neutrino mass @xcite , naturalness @xcite and colliders @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will analyze the effect of ihdm on in the light of recent results on the higgs boson searches from lhc .",
    "this effect will mainly come from charged higgs boson contributions as well as from the total decay width of the higgs boson in case that the invisible decay of the higgs into dark matter is open .",
    "we will show in this study that the ihdm can account for the excess in the di - photon cross - section reported by atlas / cms but it can also account for a deficit in the di - photon cross - section without modifying the gluon fusion rate as well as the other channels like @xmath34 .",
    "the paper is organized as follow ; in section [ section:2 ] we will give the details of the ihdm .",
    "section [ section:3 ] is devoted to theoretical and experimental constraints while in [ section:4 ] we give detail of the evaluation of @xmath35 as well as phenomenological observable at lhc . in section [ section:5 ]",
    "we will present our numerical analysis and finally we conclude in section [ section:6 ] .",
    "the inert higgs doublet model ( ihdm ) @xcite is an extension of the sm higgs sector that could provide dm particles .",
    "apart from the sm higgs doublet @xmath36 it has an additional higgs doublet @xmath37 .",
    "in addition there is a @xmath33 symmetry under which all the sm fields and @xmath36 are even while @xmath38 under @xmath33 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath33 symmetry is not spontaneously broken _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath37 field does not develop vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "these doublets in terms of physical fields can be parameterized as : h_1 = (    c _ 1^+ +",
    "v/ + ( h + i ) /    )  ,   h_2 = (    c _ 2^+ + ( s + i a)/    ) the @xmath33 symmetry naturally imposes the flavor conservation .",
    "the scalar potential allowed by @xmath33 symmetry can be written as : v = _ 1 ^ 2 |h_1|^2 + _ 2 ^ 2 |h_2|^2 + _ 1 |h_1|^4 + _ 2    [ potential ] the electroweak gauge symmetry is broken by : h_1 = (    c 0 + v/    )  ,   h_2 = (    c 0 + 0    ) this pattern of symmetry breaking ensures unbroken @xmath33 symmetry and results in two cp even neutral scalars ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) one cp odd neutral scalar ( @xmath41 ) in addition to a pair of charged scalars ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "there is no mixing between the two doublets and hence @xmath39 plays the role of the sm higgs boson .",

    "the parameter space of the scalar potential of the ihdm is reduced both by theoretical constraints as well as by the results of experimental searches . from the theoretical constraints which the ihdm is subjected to ,",
    "the most important are the ones that insure tree - level unitarity and vacuum stability of the theory :    * we force the potential to be perturbative by requiring that all quartic couplings of the scalar potential eq .",

    "we will follow exactly the technique developed in @xcite and therefore we limit ourselves to pure scalar scattering processes dominated by quartic interactions .",

    "a common approach to constrain physics beyond sm is using the global electroweak fit through the oblique @xmath40 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 parameters @xcite . in the sm",
    "the ewpt implies a relation between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this model , there is also a relation among the masses .",

    "it appears that when the unitarity constraints and vacuum stabilities are applied , a bound on @xmath66 may be obtained .",
    "note that we can restore custodial symmetry in the scalar potential of ihdm by taking @xmath67 .",
    "* here we will discuss the experimental constraints from direct searches on the masses of the ihdm . in the case of the sm higgs ( @xmath39 )",

    "note that lep , tevatron and lhc bounds on @xmath42 and @xmath81 can not apply because the standard search channels assumes that those scalars decays into a pair of fermions which are absent in the ihdm due to @xmath33 symmetry . in the ihdm",
    ", the charged higgs @xmath42 can decay into @xmath82 followed by @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",

    "such large effects can be found in various extensions of the sm , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , the next - to - mssm @xcite , the two higgs doublet model @xcite , the little higgs models @xcite , extra - dimensions @xcite and in models with triplet higgs @xcite .    in the ihdm",
    ", the partial width of @xmath89 receives an additional contribution from the charged higgs boson loop which can both lower and raise the width compared to the sm .",
