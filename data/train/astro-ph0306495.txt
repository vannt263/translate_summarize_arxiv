    "young massive stars are formed in dense giant molecular clouds , where the gas density may be as high as @xmath8 @xmath9 and the temperature as low as @xmath10 k. for this reason , the star forming regions that eventually lie in the core of the molecular cloud can be completely obscured at optical wavelengths by many magnitudes of extinction . on the other hand ,",
    "the dense molecular clouds can be traced by molecular emission , like cs and nh@xmath11 lines at radio frequencies , which are powerful tools for the determination of the physical conditions in the clouds .",
    "while ob stars are embedded in a molecular cloud , they dissociate and ionize the gas , forming compact hii regions seen at radio wavelengths , and heat the circumstellar dust which eventually radiates most of the stellar luminosity in the far - infrared ( fir ) .",
    "therefore , the most prominent tracers of young massive stars are also compact , or ultracompact h ii ( uc h ii ) regions , which have electron densities greater than @xmath12 @xmath9 and diameters smaller than 0.1 pc .",
    "wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) showed that these ultracompact h ii regions have characteristic spectral energy distributions in the far - infrared , occupying a well delimited region in the @xmath13 \\times { \\rm log}[f_\\nu(25\\mu m)/f_\\nu(12\\mu m)]$ ] space .",
    "bronfman et al . (",
    "1996 ) made an extensive survey of the cs ( 2 - 1 ) line emission toward iras point sources with colors characteristics of ultra - compact h ii regions and roman - lopes et al .",
    "( 2002 ) detected ammonia emission in the direction of the strongest sources in that survey . with the advent of the large bidimensional near - infrared array detectors , the morphological and photometric studies of extremely young galactic stellar clusters were greatly benefited . at near - infrared wavelengths ( 1 to 2.5 @xmath4 m ) it is possible to probe deep into the dense dust clouds where star formation is taking place . at those wavelengths , very young objects present large infrared excess due the presence of warm circunstellar dust .    in this paper",
    "we present the discovery of a young stellar cluster of massive stars and its associated hii region , in the direction of the iras source 16177 - 5018 .",
    "we combined 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ) data with new nir observations from laboratrio nacional de astrofisica ( lna ) , brazil .",
    "this work is a part of a survey aimed to the identification of stellar populations in the direction of iras sources that have colors characteristics of ultracompact hii regions @xcite and strong cs ( 2 - 1 ) line emission @xcite .",
    "the studied region is part of the rcw 106 complex , located in the southern galactic plane at a distance of 3.8 kpc @xcite ; it presents compact far infrared sources @xcite , intense nh@xmath11 ( j , k ) =",
    "( 1,1 ) line emission @xcite and continuum radio emission at 5 ghz as well as hydrogen recombination lines @xcite .",
    "the imaging observations were performed in june 2001 with the near infrared camera ( camiv ) of laboratrio nacional de astrofisica , brazil , equipped with a hawaii 1024x1024 pixel hgcdte array detector mounted on the 0.6 m boller & chivens telescope .",
    "the plate scale was 0.47 arcsec / pixel and the mean values of the psf full width at half maximum ( mfwhm ) were 1.2 , 1.5 and 2 arcsec at the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 images , respectively .",
    "the observations consisted of 8x 8 frames in the direction of the iras source i16177 - 5028 using @xmath17 and @xmath16 filters .",
    "the narrow band @xmath18 filter is centered at 2.24956 @xmath4 m with a fwhm of 0.06333 @xmath4 m , covering only the continuum emission .",
    "the total integration time was 540 s for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands and 1620 s for the @xmath19 filter , resulting in a sensitivity at 3@xmath20 of 17.5 , 16.8 and 13.4 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the frames were dithered by 60 arcsec , in order to remove bad pixels , cosmic rays and to eliminate the presence of objects with extended emission on the construction of the sky images .",
    "individual frames were dark subtracted and flat - fielded before being combined .",
    "we obtained a set of `` dome flats '' for each filter using an illuminated white spot in the telescope dome .",
    "sky frames were generated from a median - filtered set of the flattened frames in each band .",
    "to produce a combined image from each dithered set of images , we aligned the frames using the iraf subroutines , added the aligned frames and trimmed the resulting image to remove bad pixels at the edges of the frames .",
    "we used daofind to locate stars 4 @xmath20 above the local background and added to the daofind list all stellar objects missed by this routine but found by visual inspection of each image .",
    "because of source confusion within the region , photometry was obtained using the point spread function fitting algorithm allstar in the daophot package @xcite . for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 images the adopted psf fitting radius were 2.0 and 3.2 pixels respectively and the psf radius was 11 pixels . for the nb@xmath18 image the psf fitting radius was 4.2 pixels and",
    "the psf radius was 13 pixels .",
    "the local sky was evaluated in an annulus with an inner radius of 8 pixels and a width of 20 pixels .",
    "the values of the completeness limits for @xmath21 and @xmath19 bands are 16 , 15.5 and 12.2 magnitudes respectively and were derived from the point where the number of detected sources of magnitude @xmath22 , @xmath23 deviates from a straight line in the log(_n _ ) versus @xmath22 diagram as can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "photometric calibration was done by observing standards from the list of elias ( 1982 ) , at several air masses before and after each set of integrations .",
    "direct equivalence was assumed between our @xmath16 magnitudes and the standard @xmath18 values .",
    "photometry from 2mass all sky point source catalogue in the @xmath21 and @xmath24 filters became available recently .",
    "the @xmath25 filter , centered at 2.17 @xmath4 m , has a bandpass of 0.32 @xmath4 m .",
    "the completeness limits for this survey are 15.8 , 15.1 and 14.3 magnitudes at @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath18@xmath26 , respectively @xcite . since the 2mass @xmath25 band photometry has a completeness limit greater than our nbk photometry , we decided to use the 2mass catalogue astrometry and magnitudes in this filter to study the stellar population .",
    "even though the 2mass survey was conducted with a 1.3 m telescope , the sensitivity and resolution of our ir camera compensates our smaller collecting area , resulting in more detection in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 bands , as it will be shown in section 3.2 . for this reason we only used the more sensitive 2mass @xmath3 photometry .",
    "we also checked the consistence of our photometry comparing it with the data of the 2mass survey .",
    "we took all point sources detected by 2mass in an area of about 50 square arcmin around iras16177 - 5018 and constructed a list of sources common to both surveys in the three filters .",
    "this procedure gave us a total of 612 , 781 and 232 sources in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands respectively .",
    "we constructed graphs for m@xmath29 versus m@xmath30 @xmath17 and @xmath18 magnitudes respectively , which are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we see a good linear relation between the two systems , with a slope of 1 and a dispersion that increases with the magnitude .",
    "the infrared images , especially in the @xmath15 , nb@xmath18 and @xmath24 bands , show the presence of a small infrared nebula ( @xmath31 square arcsec ) at the iras coordinate , with an apparent concentration of embedded stars , suggesting the presence of a cluster . in figure 3 we show a combined pseudoreal colour ( @xmath14 represented in blue , @xmath15 in green and nb@xmath18 in red ) image of the whole field , and amplified images of the nebular region in the @xmath17 and nb@xmath18 bands .    in figure 4 we present the ( @xmath32 ) versus ( @xmath33 ) diagram for all stars detected in the lna @xmath27 and @xmath28 images and in the 2mass @xmath3 image or only at @xmath28 and @xmath3 , using the completeness limit for the @xmath27 magnitude , together with the position of the main sequence , giant branch and reddening vectors for early and late type stars .",
    "the majority of the sources have colors of reddened photospheres but some of them appear to the right of the reddening line for early type stars , showing `` excess '' at 2.2 @xmath4 m . when we combine the results shown by the color - color diagram with the spatial distribution of the sources , we verify that all stars situated to the right of the early type reddening vector with @xmath34 are located in the nebular region .",
    "it is well established that very young pre - main sequence objects present large infrared excess due to the presence of warm circumstellar dust .",
    "our result suggests that the stellar population in the direction of the iras source is very young , and from their position in the @xmath35 versus @xmath36 diagram they are probably young massive stellar objects .    in order to estimate the amount of interstellar extinction in the direction of the iras source we computed the average value of the color excess @xmath37 using the 11 sources from table 1 ( irs 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 18 , 22 , 23 , 26 , 28 and 31 ) that lie along the reddening line for early type stars in the color - color diagram .",
    "we assumed that the intrinsic @xmath38 colors are those of luminous early type stars ( -0.05 for o6-o8v types as given by koornneef , 1983 ) .",
    "the mean color excess obtained was @xmath39 , which for a standard reddening law @xcite corresponds to a median visual extinction @xmath40 .      in figure 5 we present a contour map constructed from the lna nb@xmath2 image , which shows the region around iras16177 - 5018 .",
    "the iras coordinate has an intrinsic error delimited by the ellipse plotted in the figure .",
    "any object inside the ellipse could be identified with the iras source and in fact , more than one of these objects may be contributing to the detected infrared flux . a more accurate position for the ir source",
    "was obtained from the midcourse space experiment - msx source catalog .",
    "the msx surveyed the entire galactic plane within @xmath41 in four mid - infrared spectral bands centered at 8.28 , 12.13 , 14.65 and 21.34 @xmath4 m , with image resolution of 20 arcsec and a global absolute astrometric accuracy of about 1.9 arcsec @xcite .",
    "we found only one msx source , with coordinates @xmath42 , @xmath43 within the iras uncertainty ellipse ; it coincides with the star we labeled irs7 in table 1 .",
    "in fact this is the only msx source in an area of about 9 square arcmin around the iras point source with detected flux at the four bands .    in figure 6",
    "we plotted the near to far - infrared spectral energy distribution of irs7 , without any correction for absorption .",
    "we can see that the msx and iras flux densities agree very well at the common wavelengths ( 12 and 21 - 25 @xmath4 m ) , indicating that only one star is responsible for the iras emission . the spectral index in the near and mid - infrared ( betweem 2.2 - 25 @xmath4 m ) , defined as @xmath44 is @xmath45 , characteristic of extremely young stellar objects in a earlier stage of evolution , when the star is deeply surrounded by a thick dusty envelope .",
    "we integrated the observed flux density between 1.25 and 100 @xmath4 m and , assuming a distance of 3.8 kpc , we obtained a luminosity @xmath46 .",
    "since most of the energy is emitted in the infrared , this can be considered a lower limit to the bolometric luminosity of the embedded star , reprocessed by a dusty envelope .",
    "pms models @xcite show that massive stars ( above 9 m@xmath47 ) evolve at constant luminosity from the hayashi track to the main - sequence .",
    "therefore , the measured luminosity gives directly a lower limit to the stellar mass of 42 m@xmath47 , corresponding to a zams star earlier than o5.5 @xcite , independent of its pms evolutionary stage .      in order to examine the assumption that a cluster of embedded young stars is present in the core of the molecular cloud",
    ", we analyzed the stellar population in two delimited regions ; one that we labeled `` nebulae '' that contains the cluster and another that we labeled `` control '' , as ilustrated in figure 7 . in that figure we represented the position of all objects detected in the @xmath28 band by crosses .",
    "we can see that the small region labeled `` cluster region '' show a concentration of sources . as mentioned in section 3 ,",
    "all the sources with excess emission at 2.2 @xmath4 m belong to the nebular region , which has an area about 1 square arcmin ( @xmath48 sq parsec at a distance of 3.8 kpc ) , compatible with the sizes of other stellar clusters studied with near infrared arrays @xcite .    in order to separate the cluster sources",
    "not detected at @xmath14 band from the field stars , we constructed a comparative @xmath49 color distribution diagram for the control and `` cluster '' regions ( with the counts for the control region normalized to the `` cluster '' region area ) , shown in figure 8 . from this diagram",
    "we can also see the existence of an excess of sources with @xmath50 in the direction of the nebulae .",
    "using these results , the following criteria was used to select the `` cluster member candidates '' for the nebulae region : a ) sources with @xmath51 that lie to the right or on the reddening vector for early type stars in the color - color diagram ; b ) sources with @xmath51 not detected at the @xmath27 band and c ) sources detected only at @xmath25 band . for the b ) and c ) criteria , the contamination from background stars , mainly late - type giants , should be very small .",
    "in fact for an average extinction @xmath52 of 28 magnitudes , the extinction in the @xmath2 band @xmath53 is about 3.1 magnitudes ( using the interstellar reddening law taken from rieke & lebofsky , 1985 ) , and for a distance to the cloud of 3.8 kpc , these sources would have @xmath54 .",
    "table 1 shows the coordinates and photometry of all selected sources ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 from both lna and 2mass and @xmath3 and coordinates from 2mass ) . from the 41 stars with measured @xmath3 magnitudes we were able to measure the lna magnitudes in 35 of them at @xmath28 and 22 at @xmath27 bands , while the 2mass survey only detected 20 objects at @xmath28 and 6 at @xmath27 bands .",
    "further information about the nature of the selected objects in table 1 can be extracted from @xmath25 versus @xmath55 color - magnitude diagram shown in figure 9 .",
    "the locus of the main - sequence for class v stars it is also plotted , with the position of each spectral type earlier than a0 v indicated by filled circles .",
    "the intrinsic colors were taken from koornneef ( 1983 ) while the absolute @xmath2 magnitudes were calculated from the absolute visual luminosity for zams taken from hanson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , for a distance of 3.8 kpc ( caswell & haynes ) . the reddening vector for a zams b0 v star , taken from rieke @xmath56 lebofsky ( 1985 ) , is shown by the dashed line with the positions of visual extinctions @xmath57 , 20 and 30 magnitudes indicated by filled circles .",
    "from this diagram we can see that the majority of sources can be classified as reddened massive stars earlier than spectral type b5 , forming an o - b cluster embedded in the molecular cloud . however , the spectral types inferred from the color - magnitude diagram are only upper limits when the stars present emission `` excess '' in the nir .",
    "we made a crude estimate of the star formation efficiency using the mass of gas measured by karnik et al .",
    "they mapped the rcw 106 region at 150 and 210 @xmath4 m and detected a compact region in the direction of the iras source 16177 - 5018 .",
    "they modeled the observed mid and far - infrared sed assuming a constant gas to dust relation @xmath58 and from the integrated luminosity about @xmath59 they obtained a mass of dust @xmath60 resulting in a mass of gas @xmath61 . from this value",
    "we estimated a lower limit to the star formation efficiency ( @xmath62 ) , using the lower limit to the number of cluster members detected as 41 and an average stellar mass of @xmath63 , which corresponds to a b0 v star @xcite : @xmath64 this is a lower limit because the mass of gas assumed for the nebular region may be overestimated since it can include a larger volume than our star forming region and also because stars fainter than our detection limit are not included .",
    "we also estimated the number of lyman - continuum photons produced in the star forming region , from the spectral types of the stars that do not show `` excess '' in the color - color diagram , using the relation between spectral type and number of lyman - continuum photons given by hanson et al .",
    "we obtained @xmath65 photons s@xmath66 .      in figure 10",
    "we shown contour maps of the infrared nebulae region at @xmath17 and nb@xmath18 bands obtained from our infrared images .",
    "the contours were calibrated in flux with the values starting at 0.18 , 0.48 and 2.8@xmath67 jy / beam respectively . from the nb@xmath18 contour map we estimated a lower limit to the flux density of the emission nebula in the @xmath2 band by measuring the area between contours and multiplying by the value of the corresponding flux density per unit area and we found @xmath68 jy .",
    "assuming that the emission process is thermal bremsstrahlung from an optically thin region , we can compare the ir with the radio flux density at 5 ghz given by caswell & hynes ( 1987 ) to obtain an upper limit to the @xmath2-band absorption .",
    "assuming constant density and temperature across the cloud and local thermodynamic equilibrium , the flux density @xmath69 due to free - free emission can be written as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the optical depth at frequency @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the planck function @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the solid angle of the source given by : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the diameter of the ionized cloud and @xmath78 the distance to the observer .",
    "the optical depth at a given frequency @xmath72 is : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the free - free absorption coefficient @xmath81 taken from rybick ( 1979 ) : @xmath82\\;(n_e n_i)\\;g_{\\rm ff}(\\nu , t)}{\\nu^3\\;z^{-2}\\ ; t^{1/2 } } \\ ] ] @xmath83 is the gaunt factor obtained from clayton ( 1968 )      for a flux density in the 5 ghz continuum of 32.4 jy and an electron temperature @xmath89 k , as given by caswell & haynes ( 1987 ) we find an expected flux density at the @xmath2 band of 11.5 jy .",
    "the measured value of 0.62 jy gives an upper limit to the @xmath2 band absorption of 3.1 magnitudes .",
    "using the interestellar extinction law given by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) we obtained a visual extinction @xmath90 in very good agreement with the value obtained in section 3.0 from the median @xmath91 color excess .",
    "we observe that is possible that the detected infrared flux at @xmath92 m has a contribution from light scattered by dust , but taking into account that the ionized region detected at radio wavelengths coincides with the near infrared nebulae and the high number of massive stars inferred from the color - magnitude diagram , we believe that the major contribution to the @xmath18 band integrated flux is probably due to free - free emission from the ionized region .",
    "we also obtained the number of ionizing lyman continuum photons @xmath93 from the radio continuum flux density using the expression derived by rubin ( 1968 ) : @xmath94}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is in mhz and @xmath95 is the fraction of helium recombination photons that are energetic enough to ionize hydrogen ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "we assumed , as in simpson & rubin ( 1990 ) the ratio @xmath97 and the average volume of @xmath98 as half the volume of @xmath99 .",
    "using equation 7 we found @xmath100 photons s@xmath66 .",
    "this value is compatible with the number of lyman continuum photons available from the main sequence stars derived in the previous section .",
    "near - ir imaging photometry in the direction of the iras source 16177 - 5018 revealed a young massive stellar cluster and its associated hii region embedded in a dense molecular cloud .",
    "we detected 41 cluster member candidates concentrated in an area of 1 square parsec , but probably other less massive sources were missed because the completeness limit .",
    "the nir counterpart of the iras point source was identified using more accurate positions from the msx catalogue .",
    "this source has a near - mid spectral index @xmath101 = 4.78 indicating that the iras source is very young , with a lower limit to the bolometric luminosity inferred from the integrated near to far - infrared flux density of about @xmath102 , which corresponds to a @xmath103 star .",
    "the average absorption found for the embedded early type stars ( @xmath104 ) coincides with the absorption of the hii region , derived by comparing the integrated extended flux density at the @xmath2 band to what is expected at this band from the observed radio emission .",
    "the number of lyman continuum photons expected from the 11 stars that lie along the reddening line for early - type stars about 1.3 @xmath105 10@xmath106 s@xmath66 , enough to produce the 5 ghz flux density and near ir emission , assumed to be originated by free - free emission .",
