    "andreev spectroscopy @xcite is a powerful instrument to measure superconducting gap in a wide temperature range , up to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a number of such measurements have been performed earlier with oxypnictides of the rfeaso@xmath14f@xmath15 family and with fese @xcite . here",
    "we present systematic studies of the current - voltage characteristics ( cvcs ) and dynamic conductance @xmath16 for superconductor - constriction - superconductor ( scs ) contacts in ce-1111 , la-1111 and fese . using the intrinsic multiple andreev reflections effect ( imare ) spectroscopy , we measured the two superconducting gap values in all three fe - based materials and determined temperature dependences of the two gaps for fese .",
    "the compounds under study belong to the class of iron - based superconductors discovered in 2008 @xcite .",
    "these materials are characterized by a layered crystal structure ; their electron energy spectrum in the normal state contains electron and hole quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface sheets , where two superconducting condensates are supposed to be formed at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "to measure the superconducting gaps we used two methods : ( i ) andreev spectroscopy @xcite of single scs nanocontacts @xcite , and ( ii ) imare spectroscopy of scs - contact stacks .",
    "the nano - sized contacts required for multiple andreev reflections spectroscopy , have been made using the `` break - junction '' technique @xcite . in this technique , breaking a bulk sample in the cryogenic environment creates a superconductor - constriction - superconductor ( scs ) junctions .",
    "bias current flowing through the sub - mcm size constriction exceeds the superconducting critical current value and causes the contact area transition to the normal state ; as a result , the studied scs - contacts may be considered as conventional sns - junctions .",
    "the main features of the @xmath18 curves for our scs - contacts comprise a pronounced excess current at low bias voltages and a subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) in the @xmath19 curve .",
    "the latter shows sharp dips at a set of bias voltages @xmath20 . for interpreting these dips we use theoretical model by kmmel _",
    "@xcite , applicable for conductance spectra of the symmetric scs - contacts :    @xmath21    as the subharmonic number @xmath22 increases , the dip amplitude decays . by plotting the @xmath23 dependence ( which must pass through the @xmath24 point ) it is easy to determine the gap value accurately . in the case of a two - band superconductor",
    ", two distinct sgs should be observed .    due to the local character of the andreev spectroscopy of scs break junctions , studies of the sgs for individual sharvin type @xcite nanocontacts",
    "allow to gain information even in case of inhomogeneous samples . in order to observe sgs ,",
    "the size @xmath25 of the andreev contact should be significantly smaller than the quasiparticles mean free path @xmath26 ( the ballistic regime ) @xcite .    because of the layered structure of fe - based superconductors , exfoliation of the sample generates nanosteps and terraces in the @xmath27-direction and thus may form not only single scs - junctions but also arrays of the s - c - s - c- ... -s- type junctions .",
    "the array represents a stack of several consequently connected ballistic scs - junctions causing an intrinsic multiple andreev reflections effect .",
    "the latter is similar to the intrinsic josephson effect in sis - array @xcite .",
    "using stacks of contacts , one can exclude surface distortion of superconductivity and observe sharp peculiarities corresponding to _ the true bulk gaps_. bias voltages for these singularities should scale with the number of contacts @xmath28 in the stack .    for temperatures up to @xmath13 , the gap @xmath29 may be obtained directly by substituting to eq.(1 ) the bias voltages corresponding to the dips @xcite .",
    "our data for three different materials are shown in figs .  1 - 5 ; they are typical for clean classical sns - contacts @xcite .",
    "as will be shown below , the data manifest two distinct sequences of dips .",
    "the @xmath18 and di(v)/dv - characteristics were measured by a computer controlled set - up using a 16 bit national instrument board .",
    "the dynamic conductance spectra @xmath16 were measured by a standard modulation technique @xcite .",
    "in this section we present andreev spectroscopy data for ce-1111 break junctions .",
    "the results reveal the existence of two superconducting energy gaps and enable evaluating their magnitude at @xmath30k . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the gap values were not measured for this material earlier .",
    "the polycrystalline ceo@xmath0f@xmath1feas samples with @xmath31  were synthesized as described in @xcite .",
    "-characteristics of three representative scs - contacts at @xmath32k : sample ce1 , contacts @xmath33 ( 1 ) and @xmath34 ( 2 ) , and sample ce2 , contact @xmath35 ( 3 ) .",
    "thin line i@xmath36(v ) shows cvc for the latter contact .",
    "the data reveal two sets of sgs corresponding to the gaps @xmath37mev ( marked with @xmath38 labels ) , and @xmath39mev ( dash - dotted vertical lines with @xmath40 labels ) .",

    "the dashed areas comprise respective minima of the first set ( marked with @xmath38 labels and originating from the large gap ) and represent a 15% uncertainty . somewhat reduced intensity of the @xmath45 minima",
    "may be caused by a slight overheating of the contact area at the highest bias voltages .",
    "the fine structure in the bias voltage interval between @xmath45 and @xmath46 signals a large gap anisotropy of about 30% .",
    "the small gap sgs starts with minima located at @xmath47mv ( marked with dash - dotted vertical lines and @xmath40 labels ) which have rather high relative amplitude , higher than the third andreev dip from the large gap sgs .",

    "the plot clearly demonstrates the anticipated linear dependence which proves unambiguously that the dips in fig . 1 do form two independent sgs , related with the presence of two superconducting gaps .",
    "the slope of the two fitting lines gives @xmath52mev , and @xmath53mev , for the large and small gaps , respectively .",

    "2 ) , we find the bcs ratio @xmath55 for the large gap , and @xmath56 for the small gap .",

    "the dynamic conductance @xmath16 of single contacts and nanosteps demonstrates two well - reproducible sets of sgs corresponding to the pair of independent gap values .",
    "the number @xmath28 of elementary contacts in a stack was controlled by comparing the single contact @xmath16 spectra with those for several stacks normalized to a single junction spectrum .",

    "it is worth noting that the dip positions and , consequently , the gap values remain unchanged under the readjustment of the contact .",

    "recently , the experimental linear dependence of the spin resonance energy @xmath108 on @xmath13 with the average slope @xmath109 was found for several iron based superconductors ( see , e.g. fig . 5 in @xcite ) .",
