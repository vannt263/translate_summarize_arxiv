    "a modification of the refraction index in 16 17 16 17 @xmath0 16=17= or 16 17 16 17 @xmath1 16=17= crystals has been observed in the 1960s and first considered as a drawback .",
    "this photo - induced variation of the index is called the photorefractive effect and occurs in any electro - optical or photoconductive crystal .",
    "applications have been found in the 1970s1980s to real - time signal processing , phase conjugation , or amplification of beams or images .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in deriving a not - too - simple but tractable mathematical model for the propagation of light in such materials .",
    "solitonic propagation is one of our concern but we focus here on initial value problems . a very complete review of solitonic propagation in photorefractive media may be found in  @xcite .",
    "our derivation follows the same guidelines as theirs but point out the different approximations made for future mathematical studies .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] we first derive the kukhtarev model for the material and then couple it to a wave propagation model for light to obtain a complete set of equations .",
    "a 1d model is obtained keeping only one of the two transverse space variables .",
    "this is a saturated nonlinear schrdinger equation , the mathematical theory of which is addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec_saturated ] in arbitrary dimension .",
    "section [ sec_cauchy ] is devoted to the study of the full 2d model with emphasis on the cauchy problem and the solitary wave solutions .",
    "the propagation of an optical wave in insulating or semi - insulating electro - optical crystals induces a charge transfer .",
    "the new distribution of charges induces in turn an electric field which produces a variation of the refraction index .",
    "the main characteristics of this effect are the following : ( 1 ) sensibility to energy ( and not to the electric field ) , ( 2 ) nonlocal effect ( charge distributions and the electric field are not located at the same position ) , ( 3 ) inertia ( charges need a certain time to move ) , ( 4 ) memory and reversibility ( in the dark the space charge , and therefore the index variation , is persistent but an uniform light redistributes uniformly all charges  this yields applications to holography ) .",
    "the sensibility to energy reminds us of kerr media yielding the classical cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "the nonlocal effects will of course complicate the mathematical analysis compared to nls equations , but the general ideas will be the same . in our final model , inertial effects will be neglected since time is removed from the material equations .",
    "memory and reversibility effects involve ion displacement in materials like 16 17 16 17 @xmath2 16=17= , which we will not take into account in the present study .",
    "the physical modeling of the photorefractive effect assumes that charges are trapped in impurities or defaults of the crystal mesh .",
    "we chose here to derive the model only in the case when charges are electrons .",
    "some materials like semi - conductors necessitate to model both electrons and holes .",
    "therefore we restrict our study to insulating media .",
    "electrons come from donor sites with density @xmath3 .",
    "this density is supposed to be much greater than that of the acceptor sites ( impurities ) which we denote by @xmath4 .",
    "the density of donor sites which are indeed ionized is @xmath5 and we of course have @xmath6 . local neutrality , i.e. no electrons in the conduction band , corresponds to the relation @xmath7 .",
    "the total charge is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron charge and @xmath10 the electron density .",
    "photoionization and recombination affect the density of ionized donor sites .",
    "photoionization is proportional to the density of not ionized donor sites ( @xmath11 ) . in the dark",
    "it is proportional to a thermal excitation rate @xmath12 but is also sensitive to light intensity @xmath13 with a photoexcitation coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "recombination is proportional to the density of electrons and occurs over a time scale @xmath15 which does not depend on @xmath10 if the excitation rate is low , therefore the total evolution of ionized donor sites is @xmath16      now the main point is to describe the three phenomena which contribute to the charge transport or current density .",
    "the first phenomenon is isotropic and is due to thermal diffusion .",
    "it is proportional to the gradient of the electron density .",
    "the electron mobility is denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the temperature and @xmath19 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the second phenomenon is drift and is collinear to the electric field @xmath20 .",
    "finallly , the photovoltaic effect is collinear to the optical axis @xmath21 and proportional to the non - ionized donor density and the field intensity with a photovoltaic coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "the total current density is therefore @xmath23      the closure of the model is first based on charge conservation and the poisson equation : @xmath24 @xmath25 the crystal is anisotropic and this is accounted for in the relative permittivity  @xmath26 which is a tensor .",
    "a careful analysis of the different electric fields has to be done . in poisson equation , @xmath27 is the space charge field which is induced by the charge density .",
    "the total field @xmath20 only occurs in the equations through its gradient ( eqs . and ) .",
    "two fields are constant and disappear in the final equations : the photovoltaic field @xmath28 , and an external field @xmath29 which is often applied in one transverse direction on the faces of the crystal . a last contribution to the total field",
    "is @xmath30 , connected to the light which propagates in the crystal and its description is given in sec .",
    "[ subsec_nls ] .",
    "the set of five equations  is called the kukhtarev model and was first given in  @xcite .",
    "we have already introduced the relative permittivity tensor @xmath26 which plays a rle in the description of the propagation of a light wave in the crystal via the wave equation : @xmath31 in a non - centrosymmetric crystal the preponderant nonlinear effect is the pockels effect which yields the following @xmath30-dependence for the permittivity tensor : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the linear electro - optic tensor and @xmath34 the mean refraction index .",
    "we now suppose that @xmath30 is a space perturbation of a plane wave ( paraxial approximation ) of frequency @xmath35 , wave vector @xmath36 and polarization",
    "@xmath37 : @xmath38 such a wave with polarization @xmath37 only `` sees '' a part of tensor @xmath39 , or equivalently a variation @xmath40 of the refraction index @xmath34 : @xmath41 \\bfe.\\ ] ] now we can write an equation for the amplitude @xmath42 which takes into account the dispersion relation @xmath43 and the slowly varying envelope approximation in the @xmath36 direction .",

    "the system is now closed but it is impossible to solve eqs .",
    ". we have to simplify them taking into account characteristic scales .",
    "our description follows ( or more precisely makes explicit the assumptions in  @xcite ) and is purely formal .",
    "the rigorous justification is certainly difficult and should include the approximations made in sec .",

    "the debye length @xmath58 is the characteristic value of the field space variation .",
    "it is determined together with the characteristic field @xmath59 .",
    "the poisson equation yields @xmath60 .",

    "anderson model@xcite is obtained using the above characteristic values and for a specific material ( 16 17 16 17 @xmath0 16=17= ) which imposes certain symmetries .",
    "the adiabatic assumption allows to get rid of the time - dependence and an asymptotic formal analysis which accounts for the very large donors density @xmath3 ends the derivation .",
    "dimensionless equations are obtained using @xmath46 and @xmath4 for electron and ion densities respectively , @xmath48 for intensities , @xmath59 for fields and @xmath56 for the permittivity tensor .",
    "coefficient @xmath12 is normalized as a dark intensity @xmath63 .",
    "we keep all the other notations but they now denote the normalized variables .",
    "the total intensity is @xmath64 .",
    "we assume that the space charge field @xmath27 derives from a potential : @xmath65 . in the adiabatic assumption matter",

    "finally , we make different assumptions on the fields : first the beam is not too thin , the photogalvanic and the external applied fields are not too large and therefore we may neglect @xmath69 ; second the propagation field amplitude is relatively small and we assimilate @xmath20 and @xmath27 .",
    "this implies @xmath70 and @xmath71 and we have only one matter equation , namely @xmath72 where @xmath73 . to obtain a `` simpler '' equation , in physics papers the variable @xmath74",

    "many equations are written which resemble those above but with different choices of asymptotic approximations . in particular numerical results",
    "are very often obtained keeping the time in the matter equations ( see  @xcite or  @xcite ) .",
    "if we look at a wider class of materials we may have different signs for the nonlinearity ( in reference to the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation , the case @xmath98 is classically called the focusing case , and @xmath99 the defocusing case ) . besides mathematicians are more accustomed to use @xmath100 as the evolution variable .",
