    "et al_@xcite for insulating copper oxide sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 provide a unique possibility to experimentally determine the single hole properties . in the frameworks of a @xmath4 model",
    "the problem has been analyzed by nazarenko _",
    "et al _ @xcite using a cluster method and bala , oles , and zaanen@xcite using a self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) .",
    "it was demonstrated in these works that including @xmath1 hopping improves agreement with experiment , but a complete description of the arpes spectra especially the k dpendent intensity was not achieved .    in the present work we consider a @xmath5 model . a dyson equation which relates the one electron green s function measured in experiment to the hole green s function found in the self - consistent born approximation",
    "is derived .",
    "we also introduce into this equation the corrections which originate from finite u as in the hubbard model . with parameters taken from lda band calculations by andersen _",
    "et al _ @xcite we got a reasonably good description of the experimental arpes spectra .",
    "the results are sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is less important .",
    "the importance of @xmath2 was also pointed out by belinicher and chernyshev @xcite . for the explanation of width of arpes",
    "spectra we need to introduce additional broadening and possible origins of this are discussed .",
    "the hamiltonian of @xmath5 model is of the form @xmath6 @xmath7 is the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath8 @xmath9 at site @xmath10 of the two - dimensional square lattice , the @xmath11 represents nearest neighbor sites , @xmath12 - next nearest neighbor ( diagonal ) , and @xmath13 represents next next nearest sites .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath14 .",
    "the size of the exchange measured in two magnon raman scattering @xcite is @xmath15 .",
    "the most recent calculation of the hopping matrix elements has been done by andersen _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they consider a two - plane situation and the effective matrix elements are slightly different for symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of orbitals between planes . after averaging over these combinations",
    "we get : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 . below we set @xmath19 , in these units @xmath20",
    "it is well known that at half filling ( one electron per site ) the model under consideration is equivalent to a heisenberg model .",
    "it represents a mott insulator with long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "we denote the corresponding ground state wave function by @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in the situation when one electron is removed from this state , so a single hole is produced .",
    "the dynamics of a single hole in the antiferromagnetic background can be described by scba @xcite .",
    "this approximation works very well due to the absence of a single loop correction to the hole - spin - wave vertex @xcite .",
    "let us recall the idea of this approximation .",
    "the bare hole operator @xmath22 is defined so that @xmath23 on the @xmath24 sublattice and @xmath25 on the @xmath26 sublattice . in the momentum representation @xmath27 @xmath28 is number of sites , @xmath29 is the average sublattice magnetization .",
    "the quasi - momentum @xmath30 is limited to be inside the magnetic brillouin zone : @xmath31 . in this notations",
    "it looks like @xmath32 has spin @xmath33 , but actually rotation invariance is violated and @xmath8 is a pseudospin which denotes the sublattice .",
    "nevertheless the pseudospin gives the correct value of the spin @xmath34-projection : @xmath35 .",
    "the coefficients in ( [ d ] ) provide the correct normalization : @xmath36 the hole green s function is defined as @xmath37 the @xmath1 , @xmath2 terms in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) correspond to the hole hopping inside one sublattice .",
    "this gives the bare hole dispersion @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . in equation ( [ e0 ] ) we took into account that the sign of a hole dispersion is opposite to that for an electron ( maximum of electron band correspond to minimum of hole band ) , and omitted some constant .",
    "the bare hole green s function is @xmath42    for spin excitations the usual linear spin - wave theory is used ( see , e.g. review paper@xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to have two types of spin - waves , @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 restricted to be inside the magnetic brillouin zone . @xmath48",
    "the spin - wave dispersion and parameters of bogoliubov transformation diagonalizing the spin - wave hamiltonian are : @xmath49    hopping to nearest a neighbor in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) gives an interaction of the hole with spin - waves .",
    "@xmath50 with vertex @xmath51 given by @xmath52 in this calculation we have used the usual mean field ground state factorization approximation : @xmath53 .",
    "the vertex @xmath51 is independent of @xmath1 , @xmath2 because these parameters correspond to hopping inside one sublattice .",
    "the form of the vertex @xmath51 is well known .",
    "the actual purpose of calculation ( [ g ] ) is to demonstrate that @xmath51 is valid in a more general situation than it is usually believed .",
    "it is independent of the particular value of the sublattice magnetization @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , for example , @xmath51 remains the same in the presence of strong additional frustrations .",
    "one can easily prove that the spin structure of the interaction ( [ hsw ] ) forbids single loop corrections to the hole - spin - wave vertex and , as usually , the two loop correction is small numerically@xcite .",
    "so , due to the spin structure we have an analog of the well known migdal theorem for electron - phonon interactions .",
    "this justifies scba according to which the hole green s function satisfies a simple dyson equation @xmath55 the anomalous green s function @xmath56 vanishes because the @xmath34-projection of spin is conserved . due to the definition of the operators ( [ d ] )",
    "the green s function ( [ gd ] ) is invariant under translation with the inverse vector of the magnetic sublattice @xmath57 @xmath58    the numerical solution of equation ( [ dy ] ) is straightforward . as usual , to avoid poles we replace @xmath59 .",
    "the energy scale consists of 300 points with variable density ( concentrated near sharp structures of @xmath60 ) .",
    "the number of points in the magnetic brillouin zone is @xmath61 which is equivalent to the lattice @xmath62 .",
    "the plots of @xmath63 as a functions of @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are presented in fig.1 .",
    "we recall that we use the set of parameters ( [ ts ] ) based on ref.@xcite .",
    "the position of the lowest peak gives the quasiparticle energy .",
    "results of the calculation can be fitted by the formula @xmath69 the dispersion has minima at ( @xmath70 . the hole pockets are slightly stretched along the direction to the zone center , and it is very different from a pure @xmath0 model @xcite . the quasiparticle residue @xmath71 can be found as the area under the peak . at the dispersion minimum it equals @xmath72 .",
    "so it is larger than in a pure @xmath0 model@xcite , but away from the dispersion minimum it drops down very rapidly",
    ". plots of the residue @xmath71 as a function of @xmath30 for @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] are given at fig .",
    "2 . throughout the brillouin zone",
    "the residue is fitted by @xmath75",
    "the operators @xmath76 , @xmath77 discussed in the previous section are defined at different sublattices . however ,",
    "when a photon kicks out an electron from the system it does not separate the sublattices . therefore for this process we have to define the operator as a simple fourier transform @xmath78 the normalization is chosen in such a way that @xmath79 this is the green s function measured in arpes .",
    "let us now find the relation between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the operator @xmath82 acting on the vacuum ( ground state of the heisenberg model ) can produce a single hole state .",
    "we denote the corresponding amplitude by @xmath83 and show it in fig .",
    "3a as a cross.the thick line corresponds to the green s function @xmath84 ( [ gc ] ) and the thin line corresponds to the @xmath60 ( [ gd ] ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath83 equals @xmath85 the operator @xmath82 acting on the vacuum can also produce a hole + spin - wave state .",
    "this amplitude is shown in fig . 3b as a circled cross with the dashed line being a spin - wave .",
    "we denote this amplitude by @xmath86 @xmath87 we stress that ( [ bk ] ) is a bare vertex .",
    "it corresponds to the instantanious creation of a hole + spin wave , but not the creation of a hole with a subsequent decay into hole + spin - wave . to elucidate this point look at fig.4.the upper part of this figure",
    "describes the wave function of the initial neel state : a - component without spin quantum fluctuations , b - component with spin quantum fluctuation .",
    "the lower part of fig.4 arises imediately from the upper one after kicking out an electron with spin up .",
    "part a does not contain a spin flip , and it corresponds to the amplitude @xmath83 ( [ ak ] ) .",
    "part b does contain a spin flip , and it corresponds to the amplitude @xmath86 ( [ bk ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "the reason is that the operator ( [ c ] ) does not correspond to any quasiparticle of the system with long - range antiferromagnetic order , and therefore the usual goldstone theorem is not applicable .",
    "let us denote by a dot ( fig .",
    "3c ) the usual hole - spin - wave vertex @xmath51 given by eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) . in the leading in @xmath90 approximation",
    "the amplitude of single hole creation by the external perturbation ( [ c ] ) is given by diagrams presented at fig .",
    "5 , with the thin solid line in this case the bare hole green s function ( [ gd0 ] ) .",
    "if we set @xmath91 and @xmath92 calculation of this amplitude can be easily done analytically @xmath93 @xmath94 is the quasiparticle residue of the green s function ( [ gc ] ) .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) agrees with the result obtained using a string representation@xcite .",
    "we stress that even at @xmath95 the residue is 0.8 due to the spin quantum fluctuation in the ground state of the heisenberg model@xcite    now we can find the relation between green s functions @xmath84 ( [ gc ] ) and @xmath60 ( [ gd ] ) . in the leading in @xmath90 approximation",
    "it is given by diagrams presented at fig .",
    "6 with the thin solid line being in this case the bare hole green s function @xmath96 ( [ gd0 ] ) .",
    "now let us dress these diagrams by higher orders in hopping @xmath90 .",
    "as we already discussed there is no single loop correction to the `` dot '' .",
    "we neglect double loop correction to the `` dot '' as it has been done in scba .",
    "therefore the only possibility is an introduction of a self energy corrections .",
    "an example of the correction to diagram fig .",
    "6c is shown at fig",
    "to take into account all these corrections we need just to replace at fig .",
    "6 all bare hole green s functions ( [ gd0 ] ) by dressed hole green s function given by eq .",
    "( [ dy ] ) .",
    "so , the fig .",
    "6 actually represents a dyson equation relating @xmath84 ( [ gc ] ) and @xmath60 ( [ gd ] ) . in analytical form",
    "it is @xmath97+\\\\ & + & g_d(\\epsilon,{\\bf k } ) \\left [ \\sum_{\\bf q}b_{\\bf k , q } g_{\\bf k - q , q } g_d(\\epsilon-\\omega_{\\bf q},{\\bf k - q } ) \\right]^2.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so as soon as we have found @xmath60 using scba ( [ dy ] ) we can calculate the green s function @xmath84 defined by eq .",
    "( [ gc ] ) .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath80 gives directly the spectra measured in arpes experiments .",
    "we now discuss sum rules .",
    "all singularities of green s functions are in the lower half plane of complex @xmath64 .",
    "therefore if we integrate eq.([dy ] ) over @xmath64 from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , this integral can be replaced by the integral over an infinite semi - circle in the upper @xmath64 half plane.for infinite @xmath64 , @xmath100 , and we get the well known sum rule @xmath101 which agrees with with eq.([norm ] ) .",
    "if we integrate now eq.([dy2 ] ) in the same limits , the terms which contain more than one green s function give zero contribution , because the integral can be transfered into the upper complex @xmath64 half plane .",
    "and we find @xmath102 thus the equation ( [ dy2 ] ) reproduces the correct normalization : @xmath103 .",
    "the vertex @xmath86 ( [ bk ] ) is invariant under translation with the inverse vector of magnetic sublattice @xmath57 : @xmath104 . at the same time",
    "the vertex @xmath51 ( [ g ] ) changes sign with this translation : @xmath105 .",
    "therefore the diagrams fig .",
    "6c , d change sign at @xmath106 and @xmath107 due to the same properties of vertices @xmath86 and @xmath51 the diagrams fig .",
    "6c , d , e ( square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ dy2 ] ) ) vanish at the face of magnetic brillouin zone ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the diagram presented at fig .",
    "6b ( term with @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ dy2 ] ) ) is small numerically .",
    "therefore at the face of magnetic brillouin zone @xmath110 . however away from the face they differ significantly .",
    "the plots of @xmath111 as a functions of @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath112 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are presented at fig.8 . a plot of the quasiparticle residue @xmath113 as a function of @xmath30 along ( 1,1 ) direction is given at fig .",
    "9 . the quasiparticle residue outside the magnetic zone is smaller than that inside . for comparison we also present a plot of @xmath71 .",
    "the picture considered above corresponded to a modified @xmath0 model .",
    "it means that double electron occupancy was forbidden .",
    "now we want to take into account the fact that the @xmath114 model originates from the hubbard model .",
    "we assume that it is a simple one band hubbard model with on site repulsion @xmath115 .",
    "first of all this gives some corrections to the `` bare '' hole dispersion ( [ e0 ] ) , see , e. g. ref.@xcite .",
    "however we assume that renormalization is done and these corrections are already included in the values of effective hopping amplitudes @xmath1 , @xmath2 given in ( [ ts ] ) .",
    "there are also some corrections to the hole - spin - wave vertex@xcite , but they are small at @xmath116 .",
    "the really important effect is the renormalization of the vertex @xmath83 ( [ ak ] ) . in @xmath0 model",
    "this vertex is given by the process shown at fig .",
    "10a : an electron is removed from corresponding sublattice . in hubbard model",
    "there is an additional possibility shown at fig .",
    "10b : first the electron hops to occupied nearest site , and then it is removed from this site .",
    "simple calculation shows that this gives @xmath117 we took into account that @xmath118 .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath119 correction in ( [ ak1 ] ) is obvious , however one should be careful with the sign . to find it one needs to commute fermionic operators in order corresponding to fig .",
    "the dyson equation ( [ dy2 ] ) remains valid .",
    "so we can easily find the green s function @xmath120 , where index @xmath121 indicates that the hubbard model correction is taken into account .",
    "the plots of @xmath122 as functions of @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath112 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are presented in fig.11 . a plot of the quasiparticle residue @xmath123 as a function of @xmath30 along ( 1,1 ) direction is given in fig .",
    "we see that the `` hubbard correction '' causes the decrease of the residue outside of the magnetic brillouin zone to be steeper .    the sum rule ( [ sum1 ] ) is changed .",
    "now we have @xmath124 let us comment on the definition ( [ c ] ) of the operator @xmath82 .",
    "its normalization is adjusted for a system with strong antiferromagnetic correlations and it is close to that for @xmath125 ( see eq.([d ] ) ) .",
    "however as a result the definition ( [ c ] ) differs from that usually accepted for a normal fermi liquid by a factor @xmath126 .",
    "this is the reason why the sum rule ( [ sum2 ] ) can be larger than unity .",
    "generally the normalization can be chosen arbitrally .",
    "it is a question of convenience only .",
    "however , let us prove that the sum rule for the total number of electrons in the system is fulfilled .",
    "according to definition ( [ c ] ) @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the operator for the number of electrons .",
    "due to the definition ( [ gc ] ) of green s function @xmath84 one has the standard relation @xmath129 comparing with ( [ sum2 ] ) we find @xmath130 the operator for the total number of electrons is equal to @xmath131 we put a `` hat '' to distinguish this operator from the number of sites n. note that in all equations before we assumed summation over momenta inside the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "but in the eq .",
    "( [ totn ] ) we must sum over the full brillouin zone . finally from eqs .",
    "( [ nn]),([totn ] ) one finds that the sum rule for the total number of electrons @xmath132 is fulfilled . in conclusion of this discussion",
    "we would like to note that the origin of all these complications with normalization is very simple : the natural zone for the operator @xmath125 is the magnetic brillouin zone . on the other hand",
    "the natural zone for @xmath82 is the full brillouin zone .",
    "this is the reason why one should be careful comparing these two operators .",
    "many of the experimental features observed are reproduced with the theory described here . the large dispersion between @xmath133 and @xmath134 and the assymetric quasi particle weight about @xmath134 with the very strong dcrease in weight on moving beyond @xmath134 .",
    "also the lack of dispersion along @xmath133 and @xmath135 as well as the very low quasiparticle weight is well reproduced . a major discrepancy between theory and experiment",
    "concerns the width of the quasi particle peak.the theoretical spectra ( figs .",
    "8,11 ) have narrow peaks . on the other hand",
    "the widths of the experimental arpes spectra@xcite are rather large , @xmath136.although the experiment has been done at higher temperature @xmath137 this is probably too low to explain the widths of the peaks in terms of excited spin waves .",
    "it seems that another degree of freedom not considered in the present work must be of importance .",
    "one such possibility is the coupling to phonons .",
    "such a coupling is expected to be quite large for the cuprates especially for the cu - o breathing mode since this strongly influences the stability of the zang - rice singlets .",
    "the coupling to phonons will result in a broadening of the quasi particle peak which can be described in terms of the franck - condon factors describing the probability that the system is left behind with a number of excited phonons upon the sudden removal of one electron@xcite .",
    "such a large width would indicate a strong coupling with phonons .",
    "in this paper we simulated the broadening with a lorentz curve with a width @xmath138 .",
    "the spectra obtained by convolution of @xmath122 with the broadening curve are given in fig .",
    "agreement of these spectra with experimental ones@xcite is quite reasonable .",
    "in the present work we consider a modified @xmath0 model at zero doping ( insulating copper oxide plane ) and zero temperature . we discuss the hole green s functions with given pseudospin and given spin and derive a dyson equation relating these two green s functions .",
    "the green s function with given pseudospin is very convenient for calculations , but it is an artificial object . in the real experiment one measures the hole green s function with given spin .    to describe the experiment we use hopping amplitudes for a modified @xmath0 model as optained from lda band calculations by andersen _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "agreement of the theoretical spectra spectra with experimental ones@xcite is quite reasonable after some broadening of the theoretical spectra.the physical origin of this broadening is not quite clear .",
    "possible explanations are in finite temperature , and the contributions due to phonons and the electron phonon interactions .",
