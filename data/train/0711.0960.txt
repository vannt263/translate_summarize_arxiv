    "the late - time tails of black holes have been studied in much detail since price s seminal work @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the problem is a straightforward one : place an observer in a circular orbit around a black hole , and have her measure at late times a generic perturbation field , that had compact support at some initial time .",
    "it is generally accepted that the observer measures the late - time perturbation field to drop off as an inverse power law of time , specifically as @xmath3 .",
    "it is the value of @xmath5 that has been controversial in the literature , with some conflicting results reported .    in the case of a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the multipole moment of the initial perturbation field .",
    "namely , if the initial ( compactly supported ) perturbation field has the angular dependence of @xmath8 , the angular dependence remains unchanged (  spherical harmonics are eigenvectors of the laplacian operator \" ) , and the decay rate of the field is governed by the @xmath7 value of the initial perturbation .",
    "these results remain unchanged also for a reissner  nordstrm black hole @xcite ( including the extremal case @xcite ) , that like the schwarzschild black hole is spherically symmetric .",
    "notably , a generic perturbation is a linear superposition of @xmath7-modes , so that the tail is dominated by the slowest damped mode , or by the lowest value of @xmath7 .    for rotating black holes conflicting values of @xmath5",
    "have been reported .",
    "obviously , the observer measures a well defined decay rate .",
    "of the various conflicting values in the literature some are wrong ( i.e. , they report a value inconsistent with the outcome of the initial value problem ) , while other results are correct ( in the same sense , of reporting the right value for the initial value problem ) .",
    "as it turns out , different initial value formulations may lead to different decay rate for the tails . while none of these is  more correct \" _ sensu stricto _ than others , it is important to understand the relationship of different initial value sets , so that the understanding may lead to some insights .",
    "one of the correct answers to the question of the value of @xmath5 was described , e.g. , in @xcite : the late - time field decays according to the same rule as in the spherically - symmetric case , namely according to @xmath1 , where @xmath9 if @xmath10 is even , and @xmath11 if @xmath10 is odd , independently of the initial value of @xmath7 .",
    "below , we dub this tail as ",
    "tail a. \" the reason for this decay rate is that spherical harmonic modes do not evolve independently on the background of a rotating black hole (  spherical harmonics are _ not _ eigenvectors of the laplacian operator \" ) . starting with an initial value for @xmath7 ,",
    "infinitely many other @xmath7 modes are excited , respecting only the dynamical constraints ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spin of the field , and @xmath14 ) and the equatorial symmetry of the initial data ( such that even and odd modes do not mix ) .",
    "another correct answer to the question was discussed recently in @xcite and in @xcite . according to this result ,",
    "@xmath15 if @xmath16 , @xmath17 if @xmath18 is even , and @xmath19 if @xmath18 is odd",
    ". this result is dubbed below as  tail b. \" evidently , this result is inconsistent with that of tail a. the tail b behavior was first predicted in @xcite . while either the tail a or the tail b behavior is a solution to _ some",
    "_ initial value problem , these problems are different enough to lead to markedly different late  time evolutions .",
    "in this paper we present some explanation for these different results , that resolves the apparent discrepancy at least for some cases .",
    "this paper s motivation is to explain some of the historical discrepancies , in what we believe is an illuminating manner .",
    "specifically , finding the reasons for the controversy in the literature teaches us important lessons .",
    "in particular , we consider two results , conflicting both with each other and with the results of this paper : the numerical results of @xcite , and the analytical model of @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we consider the simplest case for which there is a disagreement in the literature , specifically the case of a massless scalar field ( @xmath20 ) perturbation of a kerr black hole , with initial @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for this case , the late time tail drops as @xmath23 according to tail a , because the monopole @xmath24 ) mode of the scalar field can and is excited , and this mode s drop off rate obeys the @xmath25 rule . according to tail b , the late  time decay rate is @xmath26 .",
    "the ( numerical ) results of @xcite suggest a drop off rate of @xmath27 that does not appear to converge to the decay rate of tail b. the poisson analytical model ( of a globally weakly curved spacetime ) predicts a drop off rate of @xmath26 if carried over to the kerr case @xcite , which may suggest a tail b behavior",
    ". however , as we show below , the correct behavior of such tails should be that of tail a.    we discuss in detail the tails developing from initial data specified on ingoing kerr silces of @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the tail a results of @xcite are due to the slicing condition .",
    "we show that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , one can find initial condition sets with the same slicing condition as in @xcite ( slicing corresponding to the ingoing kerr coordinates ) that result in either tail a or tail b decay rates , in just the same way as with boyer ",
    "lindquist slicing .",
    "in fact , although the boyer  lindquist and ingoing kerr time slices do not coincide , we find that similar initial data lead to the same tail behavior in either .",
    "we therefore suggest that different slicing conditions may fall into equivalency classes , and boyer  lindquist and ingoing kerr slices belong to the same class .",
    "we propose that this is the case because of the properties of the transformation from boyer  lindquist and ingoing kerr coordinates .    in the case of @xcite",
    ", we attribute the ( numerically stable ! )",
    "result of a drop off rate of @xmath27 to an intermediate tail being misidentified as an asymptotic tail .",
    "as we show , the traditional representation of the tail in a log  log plot of the field as a function of time is susceptible to lead to an  optical illusion , \" that may support this misidentification .",
    "specifically , taking initial conditions that lead to a tail a decay rate , we show what may be interpreted as a tail falling off as @xmath27 , similar to what is found in @xcite , except that if the integration is carried on further in time the intermediate behavior is taken over by the true asymptotic behavior , or a tail falling off as @xmath23 .",
    "a similar effect can also be found for the tail b case .",
    "the reason @xcite mistook an intermediate tail for an asymptotic one is that @xcite chose parameters that make it harder to distinguish the two using the crude tools used in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we show that the farther out the initial pulse , the longer the intermediate tail .",
    "reference @xcite chose the initial pulse very far out , which resulted in a protracted intermediate tail . while this choice made the problem severe enough , it was even further exacerbated by making the initial pulse outgoing and by taking the kerr parameter @xmath28 .",
    "either choice makes the beginning of the tail regime postponed . as the integration time in @xcite is rather short ,",
    "we conclude that the tail analyzed in @xcite is an intermediate one , and that if the integration time were longer , @xcite too would have found a @xmath23 tail ( for tail a initial data ) or a @xmath26 tail ( for tail b initial data ) .",
    "( in view of our argument below , we comment that the code of @xcite was fourth order angularly , which we find to be satisfactory for the relatively short runs done by @xcite . )",
    "how can one then avoid misinterpreting intermediate tails as asymptotic ones ?",
    "we provide a criterion , that we believe can be used for the identification of the asymptotic tail . by our criterion ,",
    "a tail is asymptotic if the local power index @xcite is linear in @xmath29 both locally and globally , in a sense that we make precise .    in the case of @xcite",
    ", we explicitly follow the proposal of poisson , and evolve initial data that are a pure spherical harmonic mode with respect to  spherical \" coordinates , not the boyer  lindquist coordinates , that are  spheroidal \" in the language of @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", such initial data should lead to a tail b behavior when applied to a kerr background .",
    "we show that this is not the case , and tail a behavior is found .",
    "specifically , starting with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , poisson predicts the asymptotic tail to drop off as @xmath26 . in @xcite , such time evolution",
    "is demonstrated in a globally weak  curvature spacetime ( that has no symmetries ) , and it is conjectured that such behavior is carried over to the case of a kerr black hole .",
    "we show that this conjecture is not realized : instead , the evolution is according to tail a , and the drop off rate is according to @xmath23 .",
    "very recently , gleiser , price , and pullin ( henceforth gpp ) have proposed a theoretical model that expands the wave equation in ( even ) powers of the black hole s spin rate @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the gpp approach is that the zeroth order wave operator is identical to the spherically  symmetric operator , so that it can be solved numerically using a simple 1 + 1d code .",
    "each iteration in the gpp approach gives the field to the next order in @xmath31 , using the field of the previous iteration as the source term of a spherically symmetric wave operator .",
    "gpp argue that their approach is superior to the 2 + 1d approach , because it frees the numerics from the subtleties of the 2 + 1d simulations , and because the 1 + 1d numerics are inherently more reliable .",
    "we agree with these claims .",
    "the gpp argument implies that delicate cancellations exactly cancel not only the leading tail term ( in an expansion in @xmath29 ) , but also the leading subdominant mode @xcite ( for an initial @xmath21 ; for other initial choices more subdominant modes may need to be cancelled ) .",
    "gpp further argue that turning off the coupling term at very late times destroys the exact cancellation , so that the tail returns to the  naive \" decay rate .",
    "it is quite remarkable that even if this is done at extremely late times , so that the hexadecapole field is much smaller than the monopole field , it still does not lose its ability to exactly cancel out its two leading terms ( in @xmath29 ) .",
    "notably , gpp imply that different slicing conditions may be responsible for the apparently conflicting results of numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the slicing condition was that associated with ingoing kerr coordinates , in @xcite the slicing was that of the kerr ",
    "schild coordinates , and in @xcite boyer ",
    "linquist slicing was used .",
    "gpp argue that the translation of an initially pure @xmath21 mode , say , in some other slicing condition ( e.g. , ingoing kerr or kerr  schild ) into boyer ",
    "lindquist slicing results in a mixed state of modes for the boyer ",
    "lindquist slicing , and the existing lower @xmath7 ( specifically , the quadrupole and monopole ) modes on the initial time slice are the ones responsible for the tail structure . according to gpp , among all slicing conditions the boyer ",
    "lindquist one is special , as only in this slicing an initial pure @xmath21 mode leads to a tail of @xmath26 , and in all other slicing conditions an initially pure @xmath21 mode leads to a @xmath23 tail .",
    "we disagree with this viewpoint , as we find that also for ingoing kerr slicing the tail decays like @xmath26 .",
    "more recently , tiglio , kidder , and teukolsky ( tkt ) @xcite performed careful 2 + 1d simulations of the axisymmetric kerr tail problem using a pseudospectral code .",
    "the pseudospectral approach has an advantage over the finite differencing approach , in that the convergence is exponential in the former , and only a power law in the latter .",
    "consequently , in the pseudospectral approach the noise evolution problem that permeates finite differencing computations is nearly nonexistent .",
    "tkt studied two slicing cases : kerr  schild slicing and boyer ",
    "lindquist slicing .",
    "tkk found the tail a behavior in the former ( consistently with the conclusions of @xcite that were obtained in 3 + 1d ) and the tail b behavior in the latter ( consistently with gpp ) .",
    "tkt correctly point out the main reason for the difference between tail a and tail b behaviors that are found in boyer ",
    "lindquist initial data and on boyer ",
    "lindquist slicing , specifically that the zero  field momentum \" of the former is in fact a mixed state of pure multipole modes .",
    "we consider this question in great detail , and show that the momentum condition is a very special combination of states , as described below .",
    "we discuss in detail the noise evolution problem that may cause a tail b masquerade as a tail a. that is , numerical noise evolves on the grid the same way that the physical signal does , so that the tail a behavior of the noise evolution overwhelms the tail b behavior of the physical field .",
    "we then show that with care this phenomenon can be easily identified .",
    "we next discuss how initial data with the same slicing condition could lead to either tail a or tail b behavior . as shown first by gpp and then by tkt , initial data that are a pure multipole of the angular boyer ",
    "lindquist coordinates in boyer ",
    "lindquist slicing lead to tail b behavior .",
    "when one sets the initial conditions by requiring that the field s  momentum \" @xmath32 ( see below for definitions ) vanishes , the tail s behavior is that of tail a. indeed , the condition on the momentum implies that the field s multipole structure is changed , as the field",
    "s velocity now is proportional to the field multiplied by a function of the angular coordinate @xmath33 . restricting attention to low black hole spin values ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "this function is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , one would expect that in addition to an initial hexadecupole at @xmath36 one would have now also all other ( even ) multipoles at @xmath37 .",
    "an existing monopole on the initial slice at @xmath37 would then lead to a tail that has the same decay rate as a pure multipole that behaves like tail a , which is at @xmath37 .",
    "however , we show that the tail is at @xmath38 , not @xmath37 .",
    "the explanation is that the leading contribution ( in @xmath31 ) does not contribute to the monopole , so that on the initial slice the monopole is at @xmath38 , not at @xmath37 .",
    "evolution of this mode then can dominate at late times , showing a tail that is both at @xmath38 and has the tail a behavior . nevertheless , this is not the only contribution to this tail .",
    "the initial data contains also a quadrupole at @xmath37 , which also evolves a @xmath38 monopole because of the mode excitation effect .",
    "however , as in this case the quadrupole has an @xmath7 value that differs from the monopole s by only @xmath39 , the behavior is again consistent with that of tail a. therefore , the tail a behavior has three sources : a pre - existing monopole at @xmath38 , a pre - existing quadrupole at @xmath37 , and a pre - existing hexadecapole at @xmath36 , all three behaving consistently with tail a.    we further extend the numerical study to non - axisymmetric modes , and find that the tail a and tail b behaviors occur for such modes consistently with their behavior in the axisymmetric case , i.e. , they obey the aforementioned decay rate rules .",
    "we then extend the argument for tail b behavior to subdominant modes .",
    "specifically , we argue that starting with an initial mode @xmath7 , the decay rate of an ( allowed ) excited mode @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 if @xmath42 , and @xmath43 otherwise .",
    "this rule includes that of @xcite as a particular case , when @xmath44 . in particular , we consider the axisymmetric case of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( which is a subdominant mode , as also the monopole is excited ) . the quadrupole mode",
    "@xmath46 then indeed decays with @xmath47 as predicted by our proposal .",
    "we are hopeful that this paper may put some order in a confused state of affairs , in which the literature includes side by side correct results and incorrect ones , without a proper explanation of the incorrect ones , and also apparently conflicting correct results without a proper explanation of the sources for the apparent conflict .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ reliability ]",
    "we discuss the reliability of the 2 + 1d approach in calculating tails , and how carelessness can result in an incorrect value for the field . in section [ a2 ]",
    "we discuss the decomposition of the monopole projection of the tail in powers of @xmath31 , and in section [ optical_illusion ] we discuss one possible pitfall that can cause a correct field be misinterpreted . in section [ s_ingoing_kerr ]",
    "we study tails in ingoing kerr coordinates , and in section [ poisson_data ] we analyze a pure mode in  spherical \" coordinates @xcite , and show that it leads to the same tail decay rate as in  spheroidal \" coordinates .",
    "the solution of the teukolsky equation in 2 + 1d is delicate and sensitive , and can lead to qualitatively wrong results if proper care is not taken . in section [ optical_illusion ] below we show that even when the numerically computed field is the correct one , careless interpretations may lead to incorrect conclusions . in this section",
    "we first demonstrate how carelessness may lead to qualitatively wrong behavior of the solution , and then we demonstrate the reliability of the approach when proper care is taken .      the standard of scientific computation in the finite difference approach has been second order algorithms for many years .",
    "indeed , second order convergence typically implies the solution is both consistent and stable to a practical level , so that the solution is accurate enough without having to reduce the typical grid spacing to extremely low levels that would make the code too costly computationally .",
    "normal application of the dahlquist theory ( extended to pdes ) then means that if the discrete formula approximating the differential equation has locally a positive order of accuracy ( convergence ) , and that if numerical errors do not grow unboundedly ( stability ) , then the solution is convergent , in the sense that as the grid spacing goes to zero , the solution would approach the correct one .",
    "as we show below , the tail problem involves the dahlquist theory with a twist .",
    "early codes to calculate the late  time kerr tail were therefore designed to be second  order in all coordinates , i.e. , temporally , radially , and with respect to the angular coordinate @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "( in the 2 + 1d approach the field is decomposed into @xmath48 modes , so that one does not have numerical derivatives with respect to @xmath48 . )",
    "while this approach seems very natural , it can mislead into qualitatively wrong solutions .",
    "consider first a schwarzschild black hole , excited by an azimuthally symmetric ( @xmath22 ) field with @xmath21 .",
    "the decay rate of the price tail is incontrovertible in this case : as the background is spherically symmetric , spherical harmonic modes evolve independently , and the decay rate is therefore @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , 1 + 1d codes readily verify this result .    ) for three different angular resolutions ( @xmath50 ( solid ) , @xmath51 ( dashed ) , and @xmath52 ( dotted ) ) as a function of time .",
    "the lower panel on the right is the convergence order as a function of the time at @xmath53 .",
    "the initial data are for a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath54 ) , and are a gaussian centered at @xmath55 with width @xmath56 .",
    "the radial resolution is @xmath57 , and the temporal resolution is chosen to be @xmath58 , which satisfies the courant condition .",
    "the initial data are a pure multipole with @xmath21.,width=326 ]    the numerical solution with a second - order 2 + 1d numerical code may lead however to the erroneous conclusion that the decay rate is @xmath23 : in fig .",
    "[ 2nd_1 ] we show the late  time field as a function of time for three choices of the angular grid spacing , and for fixed radial and temporal grid spacings . as can be readily inferred from the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ 2nd_1 ] , the decay rate is @xmath23 , which is definitely wrong .",
    "the origin of this wrong result is indicated in the same figure : the field values themselves reduce considerably in amplitude under refinement of the grid ( almost as the second power of the ratio of the grid parameters ) .",
    "the signal seen is therefore not the physical field , but an evolved numerical noise (  leakage of multipoles \" ) .",
    "our interpretation is that while the physical signal indeed drops like @xmath49 , it is swamped by the evolved numerical noise , which has a monopole component .",
    "the latter drops like @xmath23 , so that any very long time evolution must be dominated by numerical noise .",
    "refinement of the grid parameter can postpone the numerical - noise dominated regime , but can not utterly eliminate it : refinement of the grid parameter reduces the level of the numerical noise , so that if the grid is fine enough , the noise level at a particular value of the time reduces to below the level of the physical field .",
    "however , as the former drops more slowly than the latter , at very late times the field is dominated by numerical noise ( see fig .",
    "[ 6th_1 ] below ) .    here enters the twist on the dahlquist theory : the numerical noise does not grow unboundedly .",
    "in fact , it even drops quadratically with the grid spacing , and drops with time .",
    "it does so , notwithstanding , slower than the physical signal , so that the signal may be dominated by numerical noise even though the regular dahlquist criteria are apparently satisfied .      while a second order code may in principle be sufficient to see physical tails ( for very fine grids ) , an alternative approach is to increase the order of the angular differentiation .",
    "we first show how the same initial data and grid resolutions lead to qualitatively different results in schwarzschild , and then we discuss kerr .",
    "figure [ 6th_1 ] shows the sixth order convergence of the field , for the same parameters that were shown in fig .",
    "[ 2nd_1 ] with the second order code .",
    "the field is not made of evolved noise (  leakage of multipoles \" ) , as it clearly converges to a non - zero value under grid refinement .",
    "notably , the field s amplitude even _ increases _ slightly under grid refinement .",
    "the hallmark of noise signals is that their amplitude _ decreases _ under grid refinement , as is indeed evident in fig .",
    "[ 2nd_1 ] .",
    "most importantly , the price tail drops as @xmath49 , as it should .",
    "we emphasize that these conclusions are true up to some maximal time value . for longer times the residual monopole noise , that drops slower than the physical field , will inevitably dominate .",
    "simple extrapolations reveal that the signal noise will dominate over the physical signal for @xmath59 for our choice of angular resolution .",
    "longer evolutions than that will be dominated by noise evolution . as noted above , it is not difficult to separate the physical signal regime from the noise signal regime by doing global convergence tests .",
    "it is therefore crucial _ for any tail simulation _ that convergence tests are done throughout the entire computational domain , and not limited just to short integration times ( despite the temptation to save computer time  e.g. , see @xcite ) .     for the sixth order code .",
    "the upper panel shows the @xmath60 norm for the full field ( integrated over a sphere at @xmath55 ) in three resolutions .",
    "the three curves are nearly indistinguishable on this plot s scale .",
    "the upper plot also shows the monopole projection of the field , which is pure evolved numerical noise for resolution of @xmath61 .",
    "this figure also shows the tails local power index as a function of time ( lower left ) and the convergence order of the three resolution shown on the upper panel ( lower right).,width=326 ]    in fig .",
    "[ 6th_2 ] we demonstrate the sixth order angular convergence of kerr evolutions .",
    "this figure summarizes the main parts for our claim that our tail results are reliable : the code is convergent to a non - zero value , and even increases in magnitude with grid refinement ( so that the signal seen is not an evolved noise signal ) , and the convergence order is global , throughout the computational domain .",
    "notice that in fig .",
    "[ 6th_2 ] we study the convergence with the monopole projection of the total field .",
    "this projection is more sensitive to the created and evolved monopole numerical noise than the full field , say , as we can test its convergence also at times earlier than the instant the monopole dominates the total field for the first time .",

    "indeed , it is the result of physical multipole excitations , not noise generation .",

    "we infer from the simulation data that the tail index is @xmath100 , a deviation of @xmath101 from the tail b prediction of 5 .",
    "the ingoing kerr results are obtained using a code based on the penetrating teukolsky code ( ptc ) @xcite .",
    "the ptc is written on a fixed ingoing kerr coordinate grid , which means that grid resolution becomes increasingly poor approaching the event horizon .",
    "while simple fixed mesh refinement methods can resolve this difficulty , we were able to obtain the tail index using the following method : we first find the local power index for a number of time values for different choices of the radial ( and temporal ) resolution .",
    "we then extrapolate the local power indices to infinite radial resolution , and then extrapolate the sequence of local power indices at different values of the time ( and with infinite resolutions ) to infinitely late times .",
    "the result is rather close to the expected value of 5 , but suffers from somewhat higher numerical error because of the two extrapolation cycles .",
    "as noted above , the deviation of the tail index from the tail b value is at the order of @xmath102 .",
    "we therefore conclude that class b initial data in the ingoing kerr case lead to tail b behavior .",
    "we therefore contend that initial time slices , even when are distinct , fall into equivalency classes in terms of the type of tail behavior that emerges ( recall that on a given slice multipoles can also mix because of coordinate transformations ) . the boyer ",
    "lindquist and ingoing kerr slices belong to the same equivalency class , in the sense that one finds the same tail b behavior for class b initial data .",
    "schild slices belong to a distinct equivalency class , and class b initial data lead to tail a behavior .",
    "we conjecture that the boyer  lindquist and ingoing kerr slices belong to the same equivalency class because the time slices in either are related by a transformation that does not involve the polar angular coordinate and that depends only on the temporal and azimuthal angular coordinate .",
    "one may therefore conjecture that other slicing conditions that differ from the boyer ",

    "this may be surprising , as a pure mode of poisson coordinates may be written as a mixed state of boyer  lindquist modes .",
    "this mixed state of modes effectively behaves as class a initial data , so that the intuitively expected behavior is that of tail a.    clearly , the assumption of globally weak curvature affects the tails , and shifts them from their tail a values to those reported by poisson",
    ". this could be the case if the field reflects off the regular center in the poisson spacetime , so that the leading order part of the field ( in @xmath29 ) is cancelled out and one is left with the next order in @xmath29 , or if the monopole part of the field is canceled after the reflection , leaving only the dipole and higher moments present @xcite .",
