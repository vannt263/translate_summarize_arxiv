    "the problem of core collapse supernova explosions is an old one and the attempts to understand the mechanism have been ongoing for more than 30 years .",
    "the idea that a massive star proceeds through all burning stages from h to si - burning , finally leading to the collapse of the resulting fe - core to nuclear densities with formation of a neutron star has long been discussed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the 1960s the explosion mechanism has been related to neutrino emission from the hot collapsed core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) interrupted by a period when it was speculated that the strength of the bounce at nuclear densities could permit shock waves with sufficient energies to lead to prompt explosions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , introduction of previously neglected neutrino scattering processes were introduced ( e.g. neutrino - electron scattering ) , which permitted the replacement of lost low energy neutrinos , led to a continuous energy leakage and to the death of the prompt shock within 10 ms after bounce @xcite .    since then , and with the first neutrino detection from a core collapse supernova ( sn1987a , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hope has been that further improvements would lead to successful explosions via energy deposition through neutrino and antineutrino captures on neutrons and protons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "two different paths were explored .",
    "1 .  convective instabilities , but with still simplified neutrino transport , causing either ( a ) convective transport in the core and leading to higher neutrino luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or ( b ) higher energy deposition efficiencies in convective regions .",
    "2 .  improved neutrino transport schemes , leading to higher neutrino luminosities via the full solution of the boltzmann transport equation for neutrino scattering and neutrino reactions @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years 1d spherically and 2d rotationally symmetric radiation - hydro calculations have not yet shown successful supernova explosions with the present knowledge of physical processes . .",
    "a very recent simulation of a 11.2  m@xmath7 core collapse shows a chance for successful weak explosions in a multi - d treatment with spectral neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "this leaves us with two dilemmata .",
    "first , the fundamental problem that the supernova mechanism is still not understood .",
    "second , there seems no way to predict the correct supernova nucleosynthesis yields .",
    "this is a problem in itself , but is also a limitation for the rapidly expanding field of galactic chemical evolution , which is being energized by the large amount of recent abundance observations from low metallicity stars .",
    "supernova nucleosynthesis predictions have a long tradition . but all of these predictions relied on an artificially introduced explosion , either via a piston or a thermal bomb @xcite introduced into the progenitor star model .",
    "the mass cut between the ejecta and the remnant does not emerge from the simulations , but has to be determined from additional conditions . while the usage of artificially introduced explosions is justifiable for the outer stellar layers ,",
    "provided we know the correct explosion energy to be dumped into the shock front ( on the order of 10@xmath8 erg seen in observations ) , it clearly is incorrect for the innermost ejected layers which should be directly related to the physical processes causing the explosion .",
    "this affects the fe - group composition , discussed in detail in @xcite , hereinafter tnh96 , and @xcite , which was also recognized as a clear problem by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the problem is also linked to the so - called neutrino wind , emitted seconds after the supernova explosion , and considered as a possible source of the _",
    "r_-process to produce the heaviest elements via neutron captures .",
    "an indispensable quantity to correctly describe nucleosynthesis in the innermost ejecta is the electron fraction @xmath9 in the layers undergoing explosive si - burning .",
    "this @xmath10 is set by the weak interactions in the explosively burning layers , i.e.  electron and positron captures , beta - decays , and neutrino or antineutrino captures .",
    "the dominant reactions in hot photodisintegrated matter , consisting mainly of neutrons and protons , are    @xmath11    in section [ sec : masscut ] we will show that these reactions lead to significant changes in @xmath10 toward equilibrium before the matter is ejected . we will also show that the resulting @xmath10 in the innermost ejected layers is close to 0.5 , in some areas even exceeding 0.5 . this has been strongly postulated as a requirement in order not to violate abundance constraints from galactic evolution and solar abundances ( tnh96 ) .",
    "the question arises how one could realistically simulate this behavior , given the existing problems with self - consistent explosions . discussed improvements which could lead to successful supernova explosions are rotation and magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or uncertainties in neutrino opacities ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or other microphysics properties .",
    "they would introduce additional mixing at the neutrino sphere and convective transport or change the neutrino luminosity via improved opacities .",
    "this indicates the two options for successful explosion as discussed above : ( a ) enhanced neutrino luminosities or ( b ) enhanced deposition efficiencies for neutrino capture in convective layers .",
    "these effects can be simulated in two ways : ( a ) boosting the neutrino luminosity via a scaling ( reduction ) of the neutrino scattering cross sections on nucleons while keeping the electron / positron and neutrino / antineutrino capture cross sections on neutrons and protons at their original values .",
    "( b ) boosting the energy deposition efficiencies by enhancing the neutrino and antineutrino captures on neutrons and protons . neither approachrepresents a self - consistent treatment , but no external energy is required to produce ( i ) a successful explosion with ( ii ) a consistently emerging mass cut between neutron star and ejecta .",
    "moreover , our treatment guarantees that @xmath10 is consistently determined by all weak interaction processes .",
    "even though it is uncertain how significantly absorptions of the neutrinos emitted from the protoneutron star surface contribute to the revival of the shock , it is necessary to include the neutrinos and their copious interaction with the matter in the vicinity of the protoneutron star .",
    "if the explosion is launched such that the mass cut is directly determined by the early dynamics of the explosion , this neutrino heated material will contribute to the deepest layers of the ejecta . if fallback occurs after the initial explosion , contributions by these innermost layers are only possible if strong mixing occures . in any case , this neutrino heated material will have significantly changed its composition with respect to its original progenitor composition .",
    "hence , we investigate in this section the conditions in ejecta that are subject to large neutrino fluxes .    the energy spectrum of the neutrinos is set in the vicinity of the neutrino spheres at a radius of initially @xmath12 km . before the launch of the explosion ,",
    "about two thirds of the emitted neutrinos stem from the infalling matter which is squeezed in the gravitational potential and settles on the surface of the protoneutron star .",
    "the rise in the electron energies by the compression leads to more electron neutrino emissions than electron antineutrino emissions .",
    "after the launch of the explosion , this contribution will decrease with the accretion rate and the less accretion - sensitive neutrino diffusion flux from the hot protoneutron star will dominate .",
    "an energy equipartition among the different neutrino flavors is expected to set in when the accretion luminosities have reduced to a negligible contribution .",
    "a more detailed description of this transition , however , requires multi - dimensional simulations because the evolution of the accretion rate shows quite aspherical features with narrow downflows and broad upflows that are ignored in spherical symmetry .",
    "the emitted electron flavor neutrinos may essentially interact with the material behind the accretion shock out to radii of about @xmath13 km ( `` essential '' meaning electron fraction changes on a time scale of @xmath14 ms ) .",
    "the interactions decrease steeply with increasing radius due to geometric @xmath15 dilution of the neutrino field .    in order to illustrate the basic behaviour of shock - heated matter in a neutrino bath , we first consider only the four dominant reactions , electron capture on free protons @xmath16 , and positron capture on free neutrons @xmath17 , and their inverse reactions .",
    "two independent conditions are required to specify the electron fraction and the entropy of the material , for example weak equilibrium and balance in the energy exchange with neutrinos .",
    "the change of the electron fraction , @xmath18 , with time , @xmath19 , is given by eqs .",
    "( c15 ) and ( c20 ) in @xcite .",
    "the neutrino opacities , @xmath20 , and emissivities , @xmath21 , are linked by the reciprocity relation ( detailed balance ) described in eqs .",

    "we can therefore label contributions from electron , positron , neutrino , and antineutrino capture with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 respectively , and express the opacities in @xmath29 and @xmath30 by the neutrino emissivities . after having collected all terms that do not depend on the neutrino energy into a common factor , @xmath31 , we write the total change in the electron fraction in the following form : @xmath32 .",

    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ ye_evolution ] ) and ( [ e_evolution ] ) do not presume that the neutrinos are in equilibrium with matter , nor that they assume any particular spectrum .",
    "some of these assumptions , however , lead to useful analytical formulas for the equilibrium electron fraction .",
    "dominance of the neutrino absorption terms has been assumed for the investigation of the _ r_-process in the neutrino wind of a protoneutron star @xcite ; and the cases where emission terms dominate or where the neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium have been analysed in a study of gamma - ray burst fireballs @xcite . the balance between the four reactions in eq .",

    "depending on the conditions , any one of these three quantities can assume a dominant influence on the balance in above reactions .    for neutrinos at high energies compared to @xmath44 the term @xmath45 is large and the neutrino absorption terms , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_interactions ] ) , dominate over neutrino emission . hence ,",
    "if the abundance of these high energy neutrinos is large , the equilibrium @xmath18 is determined by the balance between neutrino and antineutrino absorption and therefore dependent on the unknown neutrino distribution functions .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath10 is given by @xmath46 using eqs .",
    "( 64a ) and ( 64b ) of @xcite for @xmath47 and @xmath48 and using the fact that neutrino and antineutrino luminosities are similar ( upper right panel of figure [ fig : zone5 ] ) it can be shown that @xmath0 is achieved provided that @xmath49(see also fig .  5 in @xcite and the discussion in @xmath50 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , at earlier time , and as long as the eventual ejecta are close to the neutron star , all four reactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq_interactions ] ) are active and the neutrino distribution functions are nontrivial functions of the accretion rate , the distance from the neutrino spheres , and the local weak interactions .",
    "changes in the electron fraction are not only determined by the local neutrino fluxes and spectra , but also by the ability of the matter to accept captured electrons or neutrinos at the given conditions .",
    "especially , when the electrons are degenerate the electron chemical potential can dominate the exponential for average neutrino energies . in this case , @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_interactions ] ) is small and @xmath52 becomes large .",
    "hence , neutrino absorption , @xmath29 , and positron capture , @xmath28 , are suppressed and the electron fraction decreases because of more prolific electron captures and antineutrino absorptions .",
    "balance is only established when the ratio between proton and neutron number densities has sufficiently decreased to compensate for the suppression of @xmath29 and @xmath28 introduced by the exponential .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 and an equilibrium electron fraction @xmath54 .",
    "finally , in a plasma with nondegenerate electrons , the electron chemical potential becomes rather small so that the neutron to proton mass difference , @xmath43 , may actually dominate the exponentials in the balance equations , making @xmath51 in eq .",

    ", this situation will occur if the electron chemical potential fulfills the condition @xmath58 .",
    "the larger binding energy favors protons over neutrons .",
    "high electron fractions below @xmath59 have been predicted for supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "but recent supernova simulations with accurate neutrino transport have even exceeded the estimates , consistently finding values of @xmath57 in the vicinity of the mass cut in explosion settings .",
    "the framework for this investigation are spherically symmetric simulations with implicit general relativistic boltzmann neutrino transport , see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed description of the code agile - boltztran .",
    "it features a dynamically adaptive grid @xcite that concentrates grid points at the developing mass cut .",
    "the simulations are performed until the density drops to @xmath60 g/@xmath61 in the region of bifurcation between the ejecta and the remnant . at this time ,",
    "the mass contained in radial mass zones is becoming very small and the run experiences ill - conditioned jacobian matrices in the newton - raphson scheme .",
    "the simulations are then continued by an explicit hydrodynamic code until the temperature falls below @xmath62 k. this code employs an explicit difference scheme similar to @xcite and a simplified nuclear reaction network as explained in @xcite .",
    "we use two different approaches to enforce explosions in otherwise non - explosive supernova models .",
    "we parametrize the neutral current neutrino scattering opacities on free nucleons with a factor ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 and use a finite differencing that helps to artificially increase the diffusive fluxes in regions of very high matter density .",
    "the net result is a faster deleptonization of the protoneutron star such that the neutrino luminosities are boosted in the heating region . for the sake of computational efficiency , this first series of parametrized runs ( series a ) has been calculated with the lowest possible angular resolution , involving only inwards and outwards propagating neutrinos .",
    "however , all of these measures only affect the propagation of neutrinos in the model ; the models are still closed and respect energy and lepton number conservation . we expect that series a represents a simplification of the phenomenology of supernovae that would be driven by higher neutrino luminosities than in the standard cases , for example different forms of protoneutron star convection @xcite or improvements in the uncertain nuclear matter physics .    with progress in computer speed and code parallelization",
    ", we were able to perform simulations using standard resolution ( 6 angular bins , 12 energy groups ) for the boltzmann neutrino transport in the parameter study for series b. series b also includes the weak magnetism corrections in the neutrino cross sections @xcite .",
    "explosions are enforced by multiplying the absorptivities and emissivities ( i.e.  the reaction rates for forward and backward reactions in @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) in the heating region by equal factors .",
    "this reduces the time scale for neutrino heating without changing the important equilibrium @xmath18 and temperature .",

    "the legend in figure [ fig : evol]c also applies to figure [ fig : evol]a . in all runs , the accretion front stalls at about @xmath14 ms after bounce at a radius between @xmath68 and @xmath13 km , depending on the parameters .",
    "the accretion front is slowly receding in the more optimistic models . shortly before @xmath69 ms after bounce , the accretion front moves outward again .",
    "there may still be some additional delay until the inwards drifting material behind the shock reverses its velocity and starts to accumulate kinetic energy for the ejection .",
    "this happens at @xmath70 ms after bounce for the fastest explosion ( a20 ) and at @xmath71 ms after bounce for the slowest run ( a60 ) .",

    "realistic 3d calculations where convection ( responsible for the corrections applied to the weak rates in both series a and b ) turned on in a delayed fashion could delay the explosions and lead to larger mass cuts .",
    "in the following , we trace a mass element in the exemplary run a40 . we choose a mass element that is @xmath75 m@xmath66 outside of the mass cut .",
    "the trajectory of this mass element is represented in figure [ fig : evol]a by a dotted line : at first , the element is falling into the gravitational potential .",
    "after @xmath69 ms it passes through the accretion shock at about @xmath13 km radius and is instantaneously decelerated .",

    "the dashed and dash - dotted thick lines at the top of the graph indicate the neutrino temperature for the electron neutrinos and antineutrinos respectively .",
    "they show a rising trend in the first half of the graph .",
    "this is because the protoneutron star shrinks and the neutrino spheres become hotter as they shift deeper into the gravitational well .",
    "the discontinuity at the crossing of the shock front stems from the doppler shift when the mass element crosses the velocity jump at the accretion front . the change of the rise into a decline around @xmath77 ms after bounce is due to the decrease of the accretion rate after the lauch of the explosion .",
    "rising neutrino temperatures are resumed at a very small accretion rate after @xmath78 ms .    with the full neutrino spectrum and abundances from the simulation and with the matter density as input , we calculate the equilibrium matter temperature along the trajectory according to eq .",

    "the electrons are degenerate in the cool infalling matter .",
    "the first little blip in the trajectory after @xmath80 ms is due to the burning of the initial silicon layer to nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "it causes a slight rise in the temperature and decline in the electron chemical potential .",
    "the pronounced step up in both quantities is due to shock compression when the mass element hits the accretion front . during the drift in the heating region ,",
    "we note a temperature increase towards temperature balance ( dotted line ) by neutrino heating .",
    "the onset of the explosion during this time also leads to an expansion and drop in matter density .",
    "both effects work together to lift the electron degeneracy shortly before @xmath13 ms after bounce ( crossing of temperature and electron chemical potential lines ) .",
    "the evolution during the third phase ( ejection ) is characterised by a density decrease .",
    "the weak interaction rates decrease and the temperature declines due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "the electrons stay nondegenerate and the electron chemical potential remains smaller than the neutron to proton mass difference ( dashed thin line ) .",
    "in contrast to the electron - degenerate conditions found in past supernova simulations that fail to explode , the expanding hot plasma under neutrino irradiation favors electron fractions that exceed @xmath81 as discussed in section [ sec : highye ] .    the lower part in figure [ fig : evol]d shows the neutrino and antineutrino abundances with dashed and dash - dotted lines respectively .",
    "the variations are due to density changes rather than luminosity variations . the upper part of figure [ fig : evol]d shows the electron fraction from the simulation ( thick solid line ) and the equilibrium value determined by eq .",
    "( [ ye_evolution ] ) ( dotted line ) . the dash - dotted line in figure [ fig : evol]a shows the reaction time scale as a function of radius .",
    "the upper branch belongs to infall , the lower branch to the ejection . outside a radius of @xmath82",
    "km the reaction time scale is much larger than the dynamical time scale ; during the drift phase of our mass element in the heating region it assumes values around @xmath83 ms .",
    "thus , the low electron fraction during infall is mainly set by the progenitor model . before the shock front is crossed by the mass trajectory ,",
    "the equilibrium @xmath18 is also low because many neutrons are bound in nuclei and not available as targets for antineutrino absorption .",
    "after the shock transition , matter is dissociated and higher electron fractions are favored . at first sight , the equilibrium electron fraction appears higher than expected at the given electron degeneracy .",
    "the reason are neutrino absorption rates that are by an order of magnitude larger than the neutrino emission rates at these moderate temperatures .",
    "the thin solid line shows the high electron fraction equilibrium as it would evolve if only neutrino absorption were considered .",
    "the emission reactions alone favor a much lower equilibrium @xmath18 ( thin dashed line ) because there are only few positrons to capture under degenerate conditions . with the following rise of the temperature ,",
    "however , the neutrino emission reactions ( e.g.  electron capture ) gain weight with respect to the absorption reactions and the equilibrium @xmath18 correspondingly adjusts to lower values in the time window between @xmath84  ms .",
    "but as the electron degeneracy is lifted with further temperature increase and expansion , and the electron chemical potential dips below half the neutron to proton mass difference , the emission rates start to join the absorption rates in favoring higher electron fractions ( steep rise of the thin dashed line ) .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath18 increases again .",
    "the descent at very late time is , as in the beginning , due to the reappearance of nuclei .",

    "moreover , matter blobs that leave the heating region in an environment of large convective turnover may still show qualitatively similar features in comparison with our spherically symmetric shells , because the high electron fraction in the neutrino field is enabled by the discussed general features of expanding hot matter .",

    "this is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "these nuclei are mainly produced in the zones close to the mass cut where the electron fraction depends strongly on neutrino captures .",
    "for these mass zones relatively high entropies are attained : @xmath110 3051 . in nucleosynthesis terms",
    "this corresponds to complete explosive si - burning with a strong alpha - rich freeze - out which also leaves a finite proton abundance ( 0.0007m@xmath7 ) due to @xmath10 being larger than 0.5 .",
    "the high proton abundance permits the onset of an rp - process which , however , does not proceed too far in @xmath111 as ( due to the high entropies ) the densities are too small .",
    "the abundances result from the accumulation of matter at the waiting - point nuclei @xmath3ge , @xmath112se , @xmath113kr , @xmath114sr .",

    "our proton - rich environment constitutes an alternative or complementary production site .    for the intermediate mass elements the main improvement compared to earlier calculations is the higher production of individual nuclei like @xmath1sc and @xmath2ti .",

    "we find that the origin of the differences in nucleosynthesis yields is a consequence of an electron fraction above 0.5 which is due to a consistent treatment of all weak interaction processes on free nucleons .",
    "the obtained @xmath10 values are not sensitive to the inclusion of neutrino and antineutrino captures on nuclei .    in the absence of a ( yet ) complete nucleosynthesis calculation covering the entire region responsible for fe - group production we combine our abundances with the results of tnh96 ( see figures [ fig : abund - cffkt ] and [ fig : abund - cffkt2 ] ) .",
    "the two calculations are combined in such a way that the resulting amount of fe - group elements is the same as in this earlier work . for the inner zones ,",
    "where neutrino and antineutrino capture reactions play an important role , the results of the present calculation are used .",
    "they constitute about 30% of the total production of fe - group elements .",
    "for the other zones where neutrino / antineutrino captures do not have significant influence on the final @xmath10 we use the abundance results from tnh96 .",
    "this procedure allows us to estimate the influence of a consistent treatment of weak interaction processes on the total production of fe - group elements .",

    "they find results in agreement with our results .",
    "however , they do not report on the production of heavy nuclei with @xmath124 due to the fact that they utilize the @xmath10 from the hydrodynamic calculation but do not include neutrino interactions in their network .",

    "they may lead either to higher neutrino luminosities or higher efficiencies of neutrino energy deposition via neutrino and antineutrino captures on nucleons . in order to examine the accompanied nucleosynthesis in 1d calculations of successful explosions , we performed simulations with variations in neutrino scattering cross sections on nucleons and/or neutrino and antineutrino captures on neutrons and protons . in both cases successful explosions emerge with an interesting evolution of the @xmath10 gradient in the innermost ejecta , which were followed up by a postprocessing for nucleosynthesis purposes .",
    "the detailed nucleosynthesis calculations with a consistent treatment of all weak interactions show an electron fraction @xmath0 , i.e.   a slightly proton - rich environment with relatively high entropies of up to @xmath10850 @xmath127 per nucleon .",
    "this causes complete si - burning with an alpha - rich ( and proton - rich ) freeze - out .",
    "about 0.0007 m@xmath120 of hydrogen remain in the innermost ejecta and do not stem from mixing this matter in from the hydrogen envelope .",
    "such a proton - rich environment at relatively high entropies permits to produce also nuclei beyond @xmath111=64 , up to @xmath111=80 , with a major contribution to @xmath3zn .",
    "the rp - like process does not extend to masses beyond a=80100 as the high entropies imply too small densities for a path at very small proton separation energies .",

    "@xmath129ti is sensitive to @xmath10 and reduced in the mass range where @xmath1sc is high .",
    "this will influence the overall predictions of @xmath129ti .",
    "values of @xmath0 are due to the neutrino interactions with matter under electron non - degenerate conditions in a convectively unstable domain and thus related to the explosion mechanism .",
    "the effect of neutrinos decreases with @xmath15 and about 50 - 60% of the fe - group ejecta ( the outer part of explosive , complete si - burning ) is determined by values of @xmath10 equal to or close to the initial values inherited from stellar evolution . in this first study we have tried to give an estimate for the overall fe - group composition based on such a superposition of the present results for the innermost ejecta with those of tnh96 .",
    "future investigations will require to perform full nucleosynthesis calculation for complete stars based on these exploding models .",
    "they will also require a sensitivity test of the nucleosynthesis results to the scaling factors for neutrino - induced reactions discussed in figure [ fig : evol ] and in combination with the position of the mass cut and the explosion energy .",
