    "it has been known that nanostructures based on carbon possess unique mechanical , electrical and optical properties.@xcite among them particular attention has been given to graphene , a two - dimensional sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure with low - energy electronic excitations described by the dirac equation.@xcite at the present time suspended graphene membranes up to @xmath0 m diameter are produced.@xcite this makes possible to investigate the van der waals and casimir interaction between graphene and different material structures , such as another sheet of graphene , atoms , molecules , dielectric and metallic plates , spheres etc .",
    "respective theoretical investigations were performed using the phenomenological density - functional methods,@xcite second - order perturbation theory@xcite and , for multilayered carbon nanostructures , using the lifshitz theory.@xcite    to apply the lifshitz theory , one needs the reflection coefficients on graphene over a wide frequency region .",
    "it is customary to express the reflection coefficients in terms of the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity , a concept which is not well defined for one - atom - thick carbon nanostructures . because of this , two models for the reflection coefficients on graphene with no use of dielectric permittivity were proposed , the hydrodynamic one@xcite and the dirac one.@xcite in the framework of the hydrodynamic model , graphene is considered as an infinitesimally thin positively charged sheet , carrying a homogeneous fluid with some mass and negative charge densities .",
    "the hydrodynamic model was applied for calculation of the casimir and casimir - polder interactions.@xcite in the framework of the dirac model , it is taken into account that for energies below a few ev the dispersion relation for quasiparticles in graphene is linear with respect to the momentum , whereas it is quadratic in the hydrodynamic model .",
    "the reflection coefficients of graphene at zero and nonzero temperature were found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "some calculations of the casimir - polder graphene - atom interaction were performed at zero temperature using both the hydrodynamic and dirac models.@xcite it should be remembered , however , that both these models are only approximations .",
    "as was already mentioned , the hydrodynamic model disregards the dirac character of charge carriers in graphene . as to the dirac model",
    ", it extends the linear dispersion relation for quasiparticles to any energy , whereas this property applies only at low energies .",
    "because of this , one can conclude that in calculations of the casimir and casimir - polder forces the dirac model of graphene should be applicable at large separations between the test bodies , whereas the hydrodynamic model might work at short separation distances .",
    "there is also another approach to the application of the lifshitz theory to graphene . in this approach graphene",
    "is characterized by a spatially nonlocal dielectric permittivity depending both on the frequency and the wave vector .",
    "different authors express such a dielectric permittivity either through the polarizability of one graphene layer @xcite or in the random phase approximation.@xcite    it is well known that thermal casimir effect is a subject of debate and there are different theoretical approaches to its description.@xcite for two graphene sheets in a nonretarded regime it was found@xcite that a relatively large thermal correction to the casimir force at room temperature arises at short separation distances of tens of nanometers .",
    "this conclusion was qualitatively confirmed,@xcite using the dirac model of graphene , with an alternative explanation .",
    "the reason for the origin of large thermal correction for graphene is that the contribution of all terms with nonzero matsubara frequencies at room temperature becomes small in comparison with the zero - frequency term even at short separations .",
    "it was also found@xcite that in graphene - atom casimir - polder interaction the thermal effect depends crucially on the magnitude of a mass gap parameter in the dirac model .",
    "specifically , for a nonzero gap there exists an interval of temperatures ( separations ) where the thermal correction remains small with increasing temperature ( separation ) .",
    "the possibility of large thermal correction at short separations links the dirac model of graphene to the drude model used in the literature to describe the casimir effect between real metals.@xcite because of this , it is of much interest to investigate the thermal casimir effect in the interaction of graphene with real material bodies made of different materials .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the free energy of the casimir interaction between a suspended graphene membrane described by the dirac model and dielectric ( silicon , sapphire ) or metallic ( au , ni ) plates . in so doing materials of the plate",
    "are described by realistic dielectric permittivities taking into account the interband transitions of core electrons .",
    "we demonstrate that , similar to graphene - atom interaction , the behavior of thermal correction crucially depends on the mass gap parameter @xmath1 of the dirac model .",
    "note that although the dirac - type excitations in pristine graphene are gapless , the influence of electron - electron interaction , substrates , defects of structure , and other effects leads to a nonzero mass gap.@xcite specifically , we show that larger is the magnitude of mass gap parameter , wider is the separation ( temperature ) interval , where the thermal correction remains small with increasing separation ( temperature ) . for a metallic plate interacting with graphene , we perform all calculations using both the drude- and plasma - model approaches to the dielectric permittivity of metal . in the case when graphene described by the dirac model interacts with a metallic plate ( either nonmagnetic or magnetic ) the calculation results obtained using both approaches nearly coincide and do not depend on the magnetic properties .",
    "in contrast to the case of two drude metals , the thermal correction for a graphene - metal interaction has the same sign as the interaction energy at zero temperature , i.e. , the magnitude of the casimir free energy increases with increasing temperature . note that all results obtained for a free energy in graphene - plate geometry can be reformulated as the casimir force between a material sphere and a graphene sheet using the proximity force approximation ( pfa).@xcite as was recently shown,@xcite the error arising from the use of pfa is less than the ratio of separation distance to sphere radius .    in this paper",
    "we also compare the predictions of the dirac model for the thermal casimir effect with respective predictions of the hydrodynamic model and discuss the application region of each .",
    "specifically , it is shown that the hydrodynamic and dirac models of graphene lead to different results at short separations and to nearly coinciding results at large separations for the casimir free energy of graphene interacting at room temperature with a dielectric plate or with a nonmagnetic metallic plate described by the drude model . for a nonmagnetic metallic plate described by the plasma model or for a magnetic plate the predictions of the hydrodynamic and dirac models of graphene",
    "are significantly different at all separations considered and can be discriminated experimentally . at large separations",

    "<S> we investigate the thermal casimir interaction of a suspended graphene described by the dirac model with a plate made of dielectric or metallic materials . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficients on graphene expressed in terms of a temperature - dependent polarization tensor are used . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for a graphene with nonzero mass gap parameter the casimir free energy remains nearly constant ( and the thermal correction negligibly small ) over some temperature interval . for the interaction of graphene with metallic plate , </S>",
    "<S> the free energy is nearly the same , irrespective of whether the metal is nonmagnetic or magnetic and whether it is described using the drude- or plasma - model approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy computed using the dirac model was compared with that computed using the hydrodynamic model of graphene and big differences accessible for experimental observation have been found . for dielectric and nonmagnetic metallic plates described by the drude model </S>",
    "<S> these differences vanish with increasing temperature ( separation ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for nonmagnetic metals described by the plasma model and for magnetic metals , a severe dependence on the chosen theoretical description of graphene remains even at high temperature . in all cases the analytic asymptotic expressions for the free energy at high temperature </S>",
    "<S> are obtained and found in a very good agreement with the results of numerical computations . </S>"
