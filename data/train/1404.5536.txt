    "we study generic behavior of a class of discrete dynamic system models of neuronal networks . this class was designed to model the phenomenon of so - called _ dynamic clustering , _ where time appears to be partitioned into consecutive episodes during which certain groups of neurons fire together ,",

    "let us estimate the probability that @xmath869 satisfies conditions  ( i)(vi ) of definition  [ def : witness ] , which imply that  @xmath343 is a witness .",
    "since the vectors @xmath65 and @xmath70 are drawn from a uniform distribution subject to constraints on minimal and maximal values , the event that @xmath869 satisfies  ( i ) has probability    @xmath880    similarly , the conditional probability that @xmath869 satisfies  ( ii ) given that it satisfies  ( i ) is    @xmath881    the probability that  ( iv ) holds for a given @xmath840 with @xmath865 is approximately @xmath882 ; more generally , since we need to exclude both incoming and outgoing arcs with endpoints in  @xmath343 , the probability that  ( vi ) holds as well is approximately    @xmath883    since  ( iii ) requires one outgoing arc for every  @xmath884 except @xmath885 , the probability that all arcs required by  ( iii ) are in  @xmath8 is equal to    @xmath886    since the relevant events except  ( i ) and  ( ii ) are independent , the conditional property that @xmath869 satisfies ( i)(vi ) if it satisfies  ( v ) can be calculated as    @xmath887    where    @xmath888    in the remainder of this argument it will be convenient to sometimes write @xmath370 for @xmath889 in order to reduce clutter .",
