    "the standard model ( sm ) based on su(3)@xmath13su(2)@xmath1u(1)@xmath14 has been very successful in describing particle physics phenomena from low energy to @xmath15 ( a few ) tev .",
    "still it suffers from a number of phenomenological drawbacks such as neutrino masses and mixings , nonbaryonic dark matter ( dm ) and matter - antimatter asymmetry as well as cosmological inflation , not even mentioning theoretical puzzles such as fine tuning of higgs mass , the origin of flavor and generation , and strong cp problem , etc .. there are a number of different extensions of the sm , based on which problem it aims to solve .    one interesting gauge extension of the sm would be left - right ( lr ) symmetric models , where the right - handed fermions form su(2)@xmath6 doublets , similarly to the left - handed ( lh ) fermions forming su(2)@xmath16 doublets  @xcite . in this case",
    "one can enjoy a possibility that the left - right symmetry is completely restored in high energy scale if we assume @xmath17 and similar assumptions for yukawa couplings .",
    "also strong cp problem  @xcite , neutrino masses and mixings , and lepton number violation  @xcite can be addressed as well from different viewpoints .",
    "the canonical version of the lr model is to assume the exact left - right symmetry with the following higgs sector , su(2)@xmath16 triplet @xmath18 , su(2)@xmath6 triplet @xmath19 and su(2)@xmath1 su(2)@xmath6 bidoublet @xmath20 .",
    "then , the lr symmetry is assumed to be spontaneously broken into @xmath21 by nonzero vevs of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this setup has been studied extensively , including flavor physics  @xcite , minimal dm  @xcite and right - handed neutrino dm  @xcite .",
    "however the assumption of exact lr symmetry may be a too strong and constraining assumption . in principle , the su(2)@xmath16 and su(2)@xmath6 gauge couplings could be different even at high energy scales .",
    "moreover one can achieve the necessary gauge symmetry breaking with nonzero vevs of su(2)@xmath6 doublet @xmath7 instead of triplet @xmath19 and a bidoublet @xmath20 , which is much simpler than the canonical lr models .",
    "we also note that inverse seesaw mechanism can be applied introducing gauge singlet fermions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this simpler setup including su(2)@xmath16 doublet higgs has been studied recently  @xcite , mainly motivated by the atlas 2 tev diboson excess  @xcite where a moderate excess is also found by cms  @xcite .",
    "the 2 tev @xmath11 boson from su(2)@xmath6 is a possible explanation of the excess , which is also discussed in the canonical lr models  @xcite .",
    "although one has to await more data accumulation at lhc run 2 , it is interesting to ask oneself what kind of new physics may explain this tantalizing atlas 2 tev diboson excess , if it is a real signature of physics beyond the sm .",
    "furthermore , there is also some excess in the @xmath12 channel of the cms search  @xcite , which could be also discussed as a potential signal of @xmath11 decaying into electron and right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we construct a minimal dark matter model in the su(2)@xmath1 su(2)@xmath22 u(1)@xmath3 extension where the gauge symmetry is broken down to u(1)@xmath5 by nonzero vev s of a bidoublet @xmath8 and a su(2)@xmath6 doublet @xmath7 .",
    "we shall explore the possible candidates of dm introducing su(2)@xmath9 multiplet scalar bosons and fermions based on the idea of minimal dm  @xcite .",
    "then the su(2)@xmath6 quintuplet fermions with @xmath23 0 , 2 and 4 are investigated as candidates of minimal dm of su(2)@xmath6 multiplet .",
    "we show that properties of the minimal dm such as the mass splitting within the multiplet are different from that in the canonical lr models  @xcite .",
    "the allowed dm mass range is then different in two cases , and so is the resulting phenomenology .",
    "particularly we find that our minimal dm can be accommodated with 2 tev @xmath11 where the relic density tends to be smaller than observed value in the canonical lr model for the parameter region in which a neutral component of su(2)@xmath6 multiplet is the lightest one because of different mass splitting pattern .",
    "the mass values of dm are predicted for @xmath24 tev .",
    "we then estimate dm - nucleon scattering cross section for dm direct detection and production cross section of charged components in the dm multiplet at the lhc run 2 .",
    "let us consider a left - right extension of the sm applying the gauge symmetry su(3)@xmath13su(2)@xmath1su(2)@xmath2u(1)@xmath3 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are baryon and lepton numbers respectively  @xcite .",
    "the scalar contents are taken to be @xmath27 where the quantum numbers in the parenthesis are under the su(2)@xmath1su(2)@xmath2u(1)@xmath3 omitting su(3 ) for simplicity .",
    "here we have loosened the exact left - right symmetry and applied more simplified choice of the scalar contents to break the gauge symmetry .",

    "furthermore 2 tev @xmath11 also can be an explanation of @xmath12 excess in the cms search  @xcite when @xmath11 decays electron and right - handed neutrino  @xcite .",
    "it is also indicated that coupling relation of @xmath69 is suitable to explain these excesses  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these possibility , we fix the mass of @xmath11 as 2 tev and consider two different cases , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in following analyses .    to accommodate minimal dark matter ( dm ) within our model , we consider a new fermion or scalar su(2)@xmath9 multiplet .",
