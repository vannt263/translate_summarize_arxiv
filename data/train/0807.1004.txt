    "all bodies are surrounded by a fluctuating electromagnetic field due to the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the charge and current density inside the bodies . outside the bodies this fluctuating electromagnetic field exists partly in the form of propagating electromagnetic waves and partly in the form of evanescent waves .",
    "the theory of the fluctuating electromagnetic field was developed by rytov @xcite .",
    "a great variety of phenomena such as casimir - lifshitz forces @xcite , near - field radiative heat transfer @xcite , and friction forces @xcite can be described using this theory .",
    "lifshitz @xcite used the rytov s theory to formulate a very general theory of the dispersion interaction in the framework of the statistical physics and macroscopic electrodynamics .",

    "the lifshitz theory is formulated for systems at thermal equilibrium . at present",
    "there is an interest in the study of systems out of the thermal equilibrium ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the principal interest in the study of systems out of thermal equilibrium is connected to the possibility of tuning the interaction in both strength and sign @xcite .",
    "such systems also give a way to explore the role of thermal fluctuations usually masked at thermal equilibrium by the @xmath2 k component which dominates the interaction up to very large distances , where the actual total force result in to be very small .",
    "the casimir - lifshitz force was measured at very large distances and it was shown that the thermal effects of the casimir - lifshitz interaction are in agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "this measurement was done out of thermal equilibrium , where thermal effects are stronger .",
    "further thermal non - equilibrium effects were explored by polder and van hove @xcite , who calculated the heat - flux between two parallel plates . at present",
    "there is an increasing interest for studying near - field radiative heat transfer @xcite which is connected with the development of a near - field scanning thermal microscope @xcite .",

    "the calculation of the van der waals friction is more complicated than of the casimir - lifshitz force and the radiative heat transfer because it requires the determination of the electromagnetic field between moving boundaries .",

    "we have presented a relativistic theory of the friction force acting on a particle moving relative to the black body radiation .",
    "we have shown that the thermal radiation of the particle does not produce any acceleration and that the friction force acting on the particle is determined by external electromagnetic field associated with the black body radiation . for a metallic particle moving relative to the black body radiation",
