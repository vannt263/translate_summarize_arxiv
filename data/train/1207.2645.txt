    "bose - einstein condensation of neutral atoms is usually realized in systems with positive atomic scattering length @xmath0 ; the resulting repulsive interaction allows the formation of large @xmath2  atom condensates in harmonic potentials . even for weakly attractive interactions , however , the zero point kinetic energy of the trap can stabilize quantum degenerate gases against collapse at sufficiently low density @xcite .",

    "near this zero crossing , cloud density increases sharply , resulting in rapid three - body losses . in our experiment , we reduce density and minimize three body recombination by releasing the atoms from the harmonic trap before rapidly ramping @xmath3 to a final field @xmath11 close to @xmath8 , as done by volz _",

    "they interpreted the swelling in @xmath14 as arising from a destabilization of the condensate in the attractive regime , similar to the instability responsible for the explosive condensates of refs .  .",
    "in this work , we observe a similar elevation in @xmath14 of an @xmath1rb condensate , but only for @xmath15 t , 35% lower than the expected crossover to negative scattering length at @xmath16 t @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the interpretation of ref .  , we believe that the observed increase in cloud width , rather than indicating instability or explosion of the condensate , is related to the sudden release of the condensate from the trap , which happens much more quickly than the @xmath171  ms field ramp to negative scattering length . there is a short period of time after release , therefore , when the mean field energy of the condensate is still positive .",
    "this positive mean field energy is converted to kinetic energy during the brief time after release before the scattering length becomes negative . in analogy to the the stabilization of a weakly attractive condensate by its zero - point kinetic energy in a harmonic trap",
    ", we suggest that a similar stabilization arises from the conversion of mean field to kinetic energy prior to the reversal of the mean field from repulsive to attractive . in the untrapped case , however , the dynamics are more complex , since the condensate , at the moment of release , becomes an outward traveling , approximately spherical matter wave .",
    "upon reversal of the scattering length , it then becomes a complicated superposition of inward traveling and outward traveling spherical waves that interfere .",

    "four sets of inlets and outlets provide approximately 5 l / min of cooling water to each coil . a @xmath29  a current generates the required bias field , which settles to the desired set - point in less than 1  s @xcite . an additional set of four - turn trim coils can rapidly ( @xmath30  ms ) tune the field within @xmath31  mt ( 2  g ) of the resonance .",
    "when current is switched into the feshbach coils , the initial field response overshoots the resonance , but at a high slew rate so that few atoms are lost .",

    "[ fig : numandwidth ] , the bec was first prepared at a field either slightly above or below the feshbach resonance , and the atom trap was then turned off and the trim coils were simultaneously ramped by @xmath36 to a final field nearer the center of the resonance . the transient field from this 500  @xmath37s ramp couples inductively to the 48 turn feshbach coils and is sufficient to perturb the power supply on a level of @xmath38  ppm .",
    "we therefore actively shield the commercial power supply using a second set of trim coils , which have a greater inductive coupling to the feshbach coils but a lesser contribution to the total field at the location of the atoms . the measured transient field response associated with a step change of the trim coils in the presence of the shielding system",

    "but because of the active shielding , the amplitude of the transient is much reduced . following a 0.2  mt ( 2  g ) step change , we are therefore able to stabilize the magnetic field to within @xmath40 t ( 10  mg ) on a timescale of @xmath30  ms .",
    "this stability is maintained for longer than 10  s following the final trim coil adjustment .",
    "following release of the trap , and the final 500  @xmath37s field ramp , the condensate is allowed to freely evolve for 20.0  ms under the influence of the feshbach resonance .",
    "the field is then rapidly lowered , almost to zero , and the cloud expands for another 9.6  ms .",

    "the loss feature therefore extends to higher field offset on the high field side .",
    "somewhat surprising , however , is the change in curvature of the loss feature on the high field side .",
    "we naively expect the curvature of the atom loss curve to remain negative until no condensed atoms remain in the cloud . instead , we see a sharp inflection point at @xmath43 t , below which the slope of the remaining atom number versus final field setpoint decreases significantly .",
    "this inflection is a general feature observed over a range of experimental protocols and suggests a stabilizing influence on the condensate in a region where instability ( either rapid collapse or explosion ) might have been expected .",

    "the increase in thermal number is abrupt for all values of @xmath116 , and occurs at a final offset field @xmath120 t that is significantly lower than the theoretical width @xmath64 t , which is marked by a dotted line in the figure .",
    "the presence of thermal atoms is not included in the gpe simulations , since the 3-body loss mechanism is usually associated with loss of all three atoms from the trap . on the low side of the resonance ,",
    "the existence of a weakly bound state could mediate three body recombination at sufficiently low energies that the atoms remain trapped . on the high side of the resonance , however , no such weakly bound state exists .",
    "we recall that the shell structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : gpsim ] is not definitively observed in our experiment .",
    "however , the formation of this shell structure can be viewed as an interference effect , and self - interference has been associated with turbulence , vortex formation , and heating @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the onset of heating in our experiment is an indication of self - interference of the condensate as it collapses under the influence of attractive interactions . in simulations ,",
    "the onset of interference effects , manifest in the formation of a secondary peak in the density profile , occurs within @xmath40 t to @xmath130 t of the zero crossing of @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore have a second possible indication of the true resonance width .    finally , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : lossvsnum](c ) that the increase in @xmath13 at very low values of @xmath131 t is a robust phenomenon for any @xmath116 .",
    "we interpret this phenomenon in terms of the shell structure that appears in the density distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : gpsim ] .",
    "interference modifies the usual thomas - fermi ( inverted parabola ) density distribution , such that the contracting cloud of atoms leaves behind a shell of atoms at a radius that is larger than a simple castin - dum scaling law would predict .",
    "here we have to posit a conspiracy of heating and other imperfections that transform this shell of atoms into an effective increase in the overall diameter of the cloud .",
    "this is clearly unsatisfying .",
    "we note that the gp simulations in this paper solve the 3d gpe as an effective 1d radial equation .",
    "it is possible that a full 3d simulation including initial trap assymetries would fail to produce the shell structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : gpsim ] or would transform it in some other way .",
    "we have shown that the collapse of an untrapped @xmath1rb condensate with negative scattering length can be made to proceed in a stable manner .",
    "the condensate is stabilized against explosive collapse in part by the kinetic energy imparted upon its release from the trap . the observed increase in @xmath13",
    "may be related to a self - interference effect that imposes a shell structure onto the condensate , as seen in gpe simulations .",
    "while this shell structure is not observed directly in experiment , self - interference may be responsible for turbulence resulting in the observed increase in thermal fraction at low offset field .",
