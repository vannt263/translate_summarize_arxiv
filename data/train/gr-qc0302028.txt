    "yang s many excellent contributions to science over the years , and have even shared the common experience of aspiring to match them and managing to fall short .",
    "dealing with this is not a happy thing .",
    "i confess having become depressed over it for a time and cheering up only after realizing that everyone else had the same problem .",
    "i now no longer worry about it .",
    "one should no more agonize over this inadequacy than over being too short or bald .",
    "i recommend this course of action for the rest of you sufferers , incidentally , in case you have not figured it out already for yourselves .",
    "i also recommend that we keep trying , for prof .",
    "yang continues to be the man to beat .    my views on the great unsolved questions at the core of modern physics ",
    "quantum measurement , the emergence of the correspondence limit through decoherence , spontaneous ordering , hierarchies of laws  are strongly influenced by my life in condensed matter physics , where theoretical ideas are forced to immediate and brutal confrontation with experiment by virtue of the latter s low cost .",
    "anyone subjected to this long enough eventually develops the habit of thinking experimentally , of choosing experimental issues primarily on the basis of what one could measure in a given situation , and evaluating theories mainly on the basis of the experiments they correctly predict .",
    "this is considered overly conservative in many circles , but i disagree .",
    "i believe that physics is an experimental science , and that theory acquires authority by confronting and conforming to experiment , not the other way around .",
    "dealing with a rich experimental record day after day has the additional benefit of giving one a healthy respect for the natural world s ability to surprise and a healthy _",
    "dis_respect for the belief that all things can be calculated from first principles .",
    "i wish today to discuss the black hole horizon paradox and the incompatibility of relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "this is obviously a great problem in the physics pantheon and something of great interest to all of us , particularly in light of recent advances in string theory .",
    "however , what i have to say is not so friendly to microscopic approaches of this kind .",
    "i have become increasingly concerned that the essence of the problem may not be microscopic at all but collective , and that studying microscopic models of the vacuum may be the wrong thing to do _ even if the models are right_. i think black hole formation may be a quantum phase transition @xcite .        before explaining how such a thing could be consistent with einstein gravity and working out the experimental consequences ,",
    "let me explain the basic idea , which is straightforward .",
    "let us imagine a stretched rubber sheet with a heavy ball rolling on it , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . this is the stripped - down model of gravity familiar from science museum exhibits .",
    "the membrane represents space - time , the ball represents some gravitating object , the distortion represents the gravitational field , and the motions of small objects on the membrane represent geodesic trajectories of satellites .",
    "if the ball is not too heavy then the membrane distorts elastically to make a slight depression in response to its weight .",
    "small objects in the vicinity then fall into this distortion and orbit , membrane vibrations beamed at the ball scatter , and so forth in analogy with general relativity . if the ball is too heavy , on the other hand , the membrane ruptures and the ball falls through .",
    "when this happens the analogy with einstein gravity fails completely , since the relativity principle requires every point in space - time to be locally indistinguishable from any other , and thus expressly forbids rupture .",
    "the formal statement of this problem is that the black hole event horizon , the obvious candidate for catastrophic failure in general relativity , exhibits no singular behavior in any quantity measured in local coordinates .",
    "however , catastrophic failure is precisely what i suspect is happening at real black hole surfaces .",
    "what would facilitate this breakdown and at the same time reconcile it with what we know experimentally about relativity are the limit paradoxes of continuous quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "known physical principles operating at such transitions would enable relativity to fail quantum mechanically , just as laws of elasticity fail in the membrane , but so gently that classical einstein gravity would _ not _ be violated in any region of space - time experimentally accessible to us @xcite .",
    "this latter point is not obvious , especially if one has not thought carefully about phases and phase transitions , so one of my main tasks here today is to explain it convincingly .",
    "the possibility of relativity failure is difficult for most of us to think about , but should not be . when asked whether relatively applies at the planck scale , for example , most physicists will attempt to change the subject and , in the end , avoid committing one way or the other even though traditional relativity forbids preferred scales .",
    "everybody understands that relativity is believable because it is measured to be true , not because it ought to be true , and that extrapolating many orders of magnitude beyond present measurement capability is no less dangerous in relativity than it is in anything else .",
    "let me now begin by reminding you about the simplest known example of a phase transition , ordinary vaporization . in 1910",
    "johannes van der waals won the nobel prize in physics for his work on non - ideal gasses , and particularly for his invention of the relation    @xmath0    ) for various temperatures .",
    "the critical volume , pressure and temperature are @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the increment between successive isotherms is @xmath4 .",
    "the dotted lines show the equation of state before the maxwell construction . for freon ( ccl@xmath5f@xmath5 )",
    "the critical temperature is 385 @xmath6k and the critical pressure 4.12 mpa ( 37 atmospheres ) . ]",
    "known today as the van der waals equation of state @xcite .",
    "this approximate description of the non - deal gas captures the essential features of both departures from ideality in real vapors and the liquid - vapor transition they anticipate .",
    "@xmath7 is the pressure , @xmath8 is the volume per molecule , t is the temperature , @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are parameters characterizing the non - ideality of the fluid .",
    "@xmath10 represents the effects of attractive bonding forces between the molecules , and @xmath11 represents the volume excluded due to short - range molecular repulsions . both parameters are empirically adjusted to fit the properties of a specific substance . setting them to zero produces the ideal gas law .",
    "the van der waals equation of state describes the phase transition only implicitly .",
    "it may be seen in fig .",
    "[ dome ] that its isotherms exhibit unphysical inflections at low temperatures that result in the bulk modulus    @xmath12    becoming negative .",
    "this is a symptom of the theory s failure to correctly describe liquid - vapor coexistence . from the vast amount of work done on this problem in the 1970s , culminating in the invention of the wilson renormalization group @xcite , we understand that equations of state near phase transitions are inherently nonanalytic , and that analytic fits to them generally produce nonsense when extrapolated across phase boundaries .",
    "these non - analyticities are , however , effects of large size and disappear when the sample is small . taken literally , the van der waals equation of state is a description of a small sample . to apply it to a large sample we must take into account for the system s tendency to separate into regions of high and low density",
    "this is accomplished by finding a pressure at which the area under a straight line drawn between the two extremal volumes is the same as that under the inflecting equation of state .",
    "the end points of this maxwell construction then define the liquid and vapor densities @xcite .",
    "the critical point - the top of the liquid - vapor dome where the two - phase region shrinks to zero - is especially important for our discussion of black holes . at this point , and this point only , the bulk modulus of the fluid is identically zero . for temperatures above the critical temperature @xmath13 ,",
    "inflection does not occur , the liquid and vapor phases are physically indistinguishable , and the bulk modulus is positive . for temperature less than @xmath13 , phase separation occurs , and the bulk modulus at either end of the maxwell construction is again positive .",
    "thus at this point , and this point only , the speed of sound    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mass and mass density of the molecules , vanishes .    in conventional fluids ,",
    "the vanishing of the sound speed at the critical point causes critical opalescence , a strange phenomenon in which the fluid becomes cloudy and opaque to the transmission of light , like an opal .",
    "this is very dramatic to see .",
    "my colleague doug osheroff here at stanford has a freshman physics demonstration of critical opalescence that uses freon as the working fluid .",
    "the critical pressure and temperature of freon are sufficiently low that one can do this without endangering students in the front row .",
    "doug sets the temperature to the critical value and then slowly ramps up the pressure , while richard strauss s _ also sprach zarathustra _ plays in the background . if he times it right , the laser shining through the freon winks out at the exact moment the orchestra plays `` ta daa , '' and gets him a standing ovation .",
    "critical opalescence signals a fundamental failure of hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "equipartition among the degrees of freedom of compressional sound , which exist by virtue of the principles of hydrodynamics , requires the departure of the particle density from its average value to obey    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote different positions in the fluid , @xmath20 is an ultraviolet cutoff ( i.e. a scale at which hydrodynamics fails ) , and @xmath21 denotes thermal average .",
    "this is the quantity measured in a light scattering experiment .",
    "it becomes enormous at the critical point because @xmath22 goes to zero .",
    "however , since the density correlator can not actually become infinite , we know that the key premise of the calculation , the validity of hydrodynamics , must fail .",
    "this occurs in practice through the divergence of @xmath23 at the critical point .",
    "the laws of hydrodynamics are emergent .",
    "they are universal , exact mathematical relationships among measured quantities that develop at long length scales in liquids and gases .",
    "this development can not be deduced from the underlying equations of motion of the atoms .",
    "it is a physical phenomenon - one we know to be exactly true because it is _ measured _ to be true .",
    "emergent laws are equivalent to , and indistinguishable from , fundamental laws in all ways but one : they are vulnerable to failure by simply not emerging .",

    "phases and phase transitions are not inherently finite - temperature phenomena .",
    "they occur at zero temperature as well , and are regulated by principles of emergence in the same way as their finite - temperature relatives .",
    "the important difference is that zero - temperature phases are purely quantum - mechanical phenomena .",
    "a quantum phase familiar from everyday experience is the crystalline solid . if this is an insulator its low - energy quantum excitations consist of center - of - mass motion and sound solely .",
    "both are quantum - mechanical . the sound waves of the cold solid are quantized `` particles '' with apt physical similarities with particles of light .",
    "this analogy becomes increasingly exact as the energy scale is lowered and , in the end , results in the low - temperature specific heat of all crystalline insulators becoming the planck blackbody law    @xmath31    with the speed of light rescaled down to the speed of sound .",
    "this is shown for the specific case of al@xmath5o@xmath24 in fig .",

    "the liquid and gas phases also exist at zero temperature .",
    "the liquid is realized by either @xmath32he nor @xmath33he  both of which become superfluids when cooled to zero temperature ( although @xmath33he is more complicated ) @xcite . the compressional sound waves in these fluids",
    "are quantum - mechanical particles that become more and more accurately defined and relativistic as the energy scale is lowered .",
    "their vapor pressures become unmeasurably small at low temperatures  meaning that both will puddle at the bottom of a container and will not expand to fill the available volume .",
    "the vapor is realized by atomic bose - einstein condensates , the discovery of which by cornell , ketterle , and weiman was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2001 @xcite .",
    "atomic condensates are metastable states of matter and thus not , strictly speaking , quantum phases . however",
    ", this is unimportant .",
    "they are ground states of an equivalent fictitious hamiltonian and have all the important physical properties of phases .",

    "the existence of the quantum liquid and gas in nature means that we can think about the phase transition between them , even though it has never been observed in the laboratory .",
    "the ideal behavior would be a phase diagram something like fig .",
    "[ dome ] except with the `` temperature '' reinterpreted as parameter in the underlying equations of motion .",
    "unfortunately , not every parameterization of this transition produces a phase diagram like that of fig .",
    "real @xmath32he is described by the equations    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is a pair potential , given reasonably accurately by    @xmath38 \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{vpair}\\ ] ]    with @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41k @xcite .",

    "since the cohesion of the liquid comes from the coefficient of of @xmath42 in this potential , the most obvious way to produce the gas phase is to reduce this coefficient to zero .",
