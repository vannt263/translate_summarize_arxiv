    "let @xmath6 be an odd prime , and @xmath5 be an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath6 . for @xmath7 an integer , we consider the symplectic group @xmath4 , thought of as an algebraic group of rank @xmath8 .",
    "it is well - known that the classification ( due to chevalley ) of rational simple @xmath4-modules is the same as in characteristic zero ( see jantzen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.2 ) ) .",
    "more precisely , for every dominant weight @xmath9 there is a simple module @xmath3 , and these exhaust all isomorphism classes of simple modules . here",
    "the set of dominant weights is the same as in characteristic zero : @xmath9 is dominant iff it is a linear combination of the fundamental weights @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) with nonnegative integer coefficients .    on the other hand , while the dimensions of simple @xmath12-modules can be computed from the weyl character formula , it seems that explicit dimension formulae for the modules @xmath13 for @xmath14 are quite rare , except in rather special situations .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a survey . for fundamental weights , premet and suprunenko @xcite gave an algorithm to compute the dimensions of @xmath15 by reducing the problem to known properties of symmetric group representations .",
    "later , gow @xcite gave an explicit construction of @xmath15 for the last @xmath2 fundamental weights ( that is : @xmath10 where @xmath16 ) which allowed him to obtain a recursive formula for their dimensions .",
    "even later , foulle @xcite obtained a dimension formula for all fundamental weights .",
    "as for other weights , it is known that for weights @xmath9 in the fundamental alcove the dimension of @xmath3 is the same as the dimension of @xmath17 ( the corresponding simple module in characteristic zero ) , and can thus be computed by the weyl character formula .",
    "but for weights outside the fundamental alcove , no general dimension formula is known .",
    "a conjectural formula by lusztig for primes in a certain range was shown to hold for @xmath18 by andersen - jantzen - soergel @xcite but was recently shown not to hold for all @xmath6 in the hoped - for range by williamson @xcite .    in this paper , we show that topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) can give new information about the dimensions of some of these simple modules .",
    "specifically , we show that for every prime @xmath0 and in every rank @xmath1 , there is a family of @xmath2 dominant weights @xmath19 , lying outside of the fundamental alcove except for one weight in rank @xmath20 , for which we can express the dimension of @xmath13 by formulae similar to the verlinde formula in tqft .",
    "we found this family as a byproduct of integral @xmath21-tqft @xcite , an integral refinement of the witten - reshetikhin - turaev tqft associated to @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , we use integral @xmath21-tqft in what we call the ` equal characteristic case ' which we studied in @xcite . the family of weights @xmath19 we found together with our formulae for @xmath22 is given in the following theorem  [ 1.1 ] . we can also compute the weight space decomposition of @xmath13 for these weights @xmath19 ; this will be given in theorem  [ 1.8 ] .",
    "we follow the notation of ( * ? ? ?",

    "then    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    and @xmath38 is the same @xmath38 used in the definition of @xmath9 , except in case @xmath30 and @xmath34 , where we put @xmath39 . in case @xmath40 in rank @xmath20 , @xmath41 should be interpreted as zero .",
    "formula ( [ verl ] ) is an instance of the famous verlinde formula in tqft .",
    "formula ( [ d - verl ] ) appeared first in @xcite .",
    "note that the difference between the two formulae is that certain sines in ( [ verl ] ) have become cosines in ( [ d - verl ] ) , and the overall prefactor is different . for fixed @xmath8 ,",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be expressed as polynomials in @xmath6 and @xmath38 . see @xcite for more information and further references . in appendix  [ app - b ] , we give explicit polynomial expressions for the dimensions of our @xmath13 in rank @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath45 , the list above produces ( in order ) the fundamental weights @xmath46 .",
    "these are exactly the weights considered by gow @xcite . for @xmath47 ,",
    "our weights are different from those of gow .",
    "it is intriguing that both gow s and our family of weights have @xmath2 elements",
    ".    can one find similar verlinde - like dimension formulae for other families of dominant weights ?    in @xcite , we answered this question affirmatively for the @xmath2 fundamental weights considered by gow .",
    "but @xcite was based on gow s recursion formula , not on tqft as in the present paper . on the other hand , @xmath21-tqft is just one of the simplest tqfts within the family of witten - reshetikhin - turaev tqfts , and it is conceivable that other integral tqfts ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) might produce more families of weights @xmath19 where the methods of the present paper could be applied .",

    "cabling each component of @xmath176 by @xmath485 gives rise to a skein element @xmath492 in @xmath493 , and the skein element @xmath481 appearing in our computation of matrix coefficients ( see ( [ mco ] ) ) is obtained by placing @xmath489 copies of @xmath492 into @xmath494 .",
    "we can view @xmath492 as an element of the free @xmath136$]-module @xmath495 . the orthogonal lollipop basis @xmath460 of @xmath495 is indexed by colorings of the form @xmath496 . as before , let @xmath83 denote the zero coloring .",
    "the following lemma is the key to proving lemma  [ lemm - app-2 ] , as it shows that all but two coefficients of @xmath492 in the @xmath460 basis are divisible by @xmath459 .",
    "@xmath497 for some @xmath498 $ ] .",
    "we have that @xmath499 is represented by the empty link and @xmath500 is @xmath501 times the elementary tripod ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "7.1 ) shows that if @xmath152 and @xmath341 have the same parity , then ( [ mco2 ] ) is divisible by @xmath459 ( since a tripod has @xmath87 elementary lollipops ) .",

    "the 6-component banded link @xmath176 in @xmath493 can be described as follows ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) ) . we can number the components of @xmath176 as @xmath511 such that the following holds .",
    "the components @xmath512 lie in a ball @xmath513 and form zero - framed borromean rings . for @xmath514 , the component",
    "@xmath515 is a zero - framed unknot going once around the @xmath58th ` hole ' of @xmath493 ; moreover @xmath515 is linked exactly once with @xmath516 , and unlinked with the two other @xmath517s .",
    "recall that @xmath492 is obtained by cabling each of these 6 components by @xmath485 . for the lemma , we need to compute the coefficients of the basis vectors @xmath518 in @xmath492 .",
    "( in fact , except for the zero coloring , we only need these coefficients modulo @xmath459 . )",
    "such a coefficient is given by the hopf pairing @xmath519 as explained above , this is computed as the kauffman bracket of a certain skein element in @xmath470 .",
    "using now the handle slide property of @xmath485 ( which is at the basis of the skein - theoretic construction of tqft @xcite ) , we can compute this by performing surgery on @xmath176 , which gives back @xmath470 , but transforms the standard embedding of @xmath520 in @xmath470 into an embedding @xmath521 of @xmath520 in @xmath470 where the three handles of @xmath522 are linked as in the borromean rings .",

    "the following lemma  [ yp2 ] shows that ( [ cov ] ) is divisible by @xmath459 as soon as @xmath526 or @xmath527 .",

    "( this follows from ( [ dl ] ) and the definition of @xmath541 in @xcite . ) below , we say that such a skein element has no denominators .",
    "let @xmath420 denote the result of evaluating ( [ cov ] ) with @xmath540 in place of @xmath542 .",
    "since the three lollipops are linked as in the borromean rings , we can pull the first two of them apart and consider the third as just some skein element in the complement of the first two .",
    "in other words , by cutting @xmath540 at the midpoint of the edge labelled @xmath543 , we can write @xmath420 as the genus two hopf pairing of two skein elements , say @xmath544 and @xmath545 , in a genus @xmath55 handlebody with one banded point labelled @xmath543 . moreover , one of these two skein elements , say @xmath544 ( namely the one containing the first two lollipops ) , is a power of @xmath459 times the basis element @xmath546 of the orthogonal lollipop basis of @xmath547 . rewriting @xmath545 also in this basis and using the formulae in @xcite for the hopf pairing in the orthogonal lollipop basis",
    ", one finds that @xmath420 is divisible by @xmath548 .",
    "( here it is important to observe that both @xmath544 and @xmath545 are skein elements without denominators . )",
