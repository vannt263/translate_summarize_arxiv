    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are important tools for understanding the evolution of the universe because of their high luminosities and light  curve homogeneity , which led to their standardization for cosmological distance measurements @xcite and the discovery of the acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "they are also important because of their complex nucleosynthetic output and high ejecta kinetic energies ( @xmath2 erg ) , which make them key ingredients for galaxy evolution theory .",
    "unfortunately , we still lack a clear understanding of the nature of sn ia progenitors .",
    "although it is generally accepted that their progenitors are carbon oxygen white dwarfs ( co wd ) in mass transfering binary systems , there is no agreement on what their companions are , whether the co wd reaches the chandrasekhar mass at ignition , what the mechanism that triggers the ignition is and how the co wd burns to form the ejecta .",
    "perhaps the two scenarios that best match observed sn ia spectra and light curves are those considered in @xcite : either a stably accreting carbon oxygen white dwarf ( co wd ) that reaches the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath3 ) , undergoes a thermonuclear runaway and burns in a deflagration to detonation transition , in the @xmath3single degenerate ( sd ) scenario ; or a pair of co wds that merge and ignite dynamically in the violent double degenerate ( dd ) scenario @xcite .",
    "two significant differences between both scenarios are the typical central densities at ignition and the distribution of circumstellar material ( csm ) around their progenitor systems . in the @xmath4sd scenario",
    "the central density at ignition is sufficiently high to avoid the synthesis of radioactive @xmath5ni in favor of stable iron group elements ( iges ) in the innermost regions of the ejecta .",
    "the @xmath3sd scenario has potentially abundant csm that could be produced by either the wind of the donor star , weak nova explosions experienced by the accretor , or by mass loss due to inefficient mass transfer . in the violent dd ",
    "scenario , conversely , the primary central density is never high enough to avoid the synthesis of radioactive @xmath5ni in the innermost regions of the ejecta , and since the merger and ignition happen in a dynamical time ",
    "scale there is no time to leave a significant imprint in the csm .",
    "the @xmath3sd scenario appears to over  produce iges @xcite , which are not produced significantly in the violent dd scenario .",
    "observations of flat  topped profiles of fe ii lines in the optical and nir at late phases has been argued to be evidence for stable iges in the innermost regions of the ejecta @xcite . moreover ,",
    "significant nebular velocity shifts ( @xmath0 ) measured in these flat  topped profiles have been suggested as evidence for off ",
    "center ignition scenarios , which is expected in @xmath3sd scenarios ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the relation between @xmath6 and other properties such as the rate of evolution of the velocity of si absorption lines ( the _ velocity gradient _ ) or the colors during the photospheric phase of evolution seems to lend support to this picture .    for the nearby sn 2011fe",
    ", there is evidence for lack of interaction between the ejecta and a companion star or a companion star wind .",
    "the radius of the companion star has been constrained to be less than 0.1 @xmath7 @xcite , and its mass loss , less than @xmath8 @xmath9 yr@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that sne ia show an excess of blue - shifted narrow na lines , which is evidence for csm around type ia progenitors ejected before explosion .",
    "particular cases , specifically sn 2002ic @xcite , sn 2006x ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite ) , sn 1999cl @xcite and sn 2007le @xcite have also provided evidence for csm around sne ia , although in the case of sn 2002ic the nature of the explosion is unclear @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that sne ia with variable narrow absorption lines tend to have broad lines and high velocity gradients .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that higher velocity at peak , redder sne ia are preferentially found in lower mass host galaxies , but also that they have an excess of blue - shifted absorption systems @xcite .",
    "these observations highlight the importance of understanding the relation between progenitor systems and dust properties for cosmological distance determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since sne ia with @xmath1 are known to have higher velocity gradients , generally associated to higher velocities at peak , and to be redder @xcite , we investigate the relation between the presence or absence of narrow na i d1 & d2 and ca ii h & k absorption lines ( hereafter na and ca lines ) , a proxy for material in the line of sight , with @xmath0 , a geometrical proxy that should depend only on viewing angle @xcite and that should therefore be independent of any evolutionary or host galaxy effects .",
    "in this work we have used the sample of 25 nearby sne ia with measured nebular velocity shifts ( @xmath0 ) derived by @xcite and @xcite for which we have measured equivalent widths ( ews ) of na ( 24 sne ) and ca ( 23 sne ) absorption systems .",
    "the ews were obtained from mid  resolution spectra in the public center for astrophysics ( cfa ) spectra database @xcite for most sne ia , from @xcite for sn2009dc , from high  resolution spectra in the european southern observatory ( eso ) archive for sn 2000cx , sn 2001el and sn 2006x , from @xcite for sn 2007sr and sn 2007af , using @xcite , values from the literature for sn 1986 g , sn 2004eo and sn 2006dd @xcite , and our own x  shooter data for sn 2010ev .",
    "we note that although there are public spectra for sn 1990n and sn 2004eo , we do not use them because they appear to have been artificially smoothed in the wavelength direction , removing all evidence for narrow lines .",
    "we have written a python script to measure ews in every sn for every epoch available .",
    "the script first defines the continuum by tracing straight lines between nodes automatically defined .",
    "the position of the nodes is chosen to avoid being too close to the lines being measured , and the flux associated to every node is defined by locally averaging the observed flux with typical velocity ranges proportional to the separation between nodes and a continuous smoothing function .",
    "after the nodes are placed and the continuum defined , we visually inspect the spectra , divide the observed flux by the continuum and compute the area below unity within 300 km s@xmath10 of every line in @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the fluxes of pixels with velocities within 300 km s@xmath10 of the line of interest , @xmath14 is the continuum value for every pixel , and @xmath15 is the wavelength separation between pixels . in order to obtain more robust ew determinations , for every sn we use the median ew among all available epochs , excluding those epochs with significantly larger errors .",
    "we have considered four sources of error in our method somewhat conservatively : flux measurement uncertainties ( @xmath16 ) , continuum flux uncertainties ( @xmath17 ) , possible systematic deviations in our method ( @xmath18 ) , and the median absolute deviation ( a robust error measurement ) of the ews for different epochs for every sn ( @xmath19 ) . @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 were obtained using the quoted flux uncertainties for every spectra at different wavelengths and propagating errors using equation  ( [ eq : ew ] ) to compute the ew uncertainty , @xmath20 : @xmath21 ~d\\lambda^2 \\equiv    \\sigma_f^2 + \\sigma_c^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are the flux uncertainties in every pixel , @xmath23 is the uncertainty associated to the continuum at every pixel , defined as the average node flux uncertainty of the closest two nodes to every pixel , and where each node uncertainty is defined by weighting the @xmath22 s in the same way as the flux of every node is defined .    to determine @xmath18 we have run our script assuming that the lines are in positions of the spectra where no low velocity absorption lines should be found , changing these positions artificially along the spectra and using quadratically averaged values of the derived ews as the final errors . to determine @xmath19 we simply computed the median absolute deviation of the measured ews at different epochs , excluding those values with relatively large errors .",

    "the fact that some sne ia show high ews and @xmath28 ( 3 out of 14 ) is expected , since in some cases the ews will be due to host galaxy material and not csm absorption . even if their high ews are due to csm our ks tests rule out that these exceptions are significant . in particular ,",
    "sn 1986 g and sn 2006dd appear to be located behind prominent dust lanes of their host galaxies and sn 2006dd has the second highest ncr@xmath31 statistic in our sample ( 0.827 ) , implying a possible association with sf .",
    "however , sn 2006dd and sn 2009dc have been suggested to show some signs of csm based on their na line evolution @xcite and light curve shape @xcite , hence we can not rule out that their high ews are due to csm .",
    "most sne ia with @xmath1 in figure  [ fig : ewhna_ewhca ] have some degree of association with sf ( ncr@xmath29 ) , which could be associated to higher ews due to non  csm in the line of sight .",
    "however , only 2 out of 10 sne ia with @xmath1 are strongly associated with sf ( ncr@xmath32 ) , whereas 4 out of 15 sne with @xmath28 are strongly associated to sf .",
    "this suggests that higher ews in our sample are not primarily due to host galaxy non  csm , which is consistent with the excess of blue  shifted na lines found by @xcite , and which is supported by the high @xmath25values for the ncr@xmath31 and ncr@xmath33 ks tests in table  3 .",
    "it could also be argued that ncr statistics are only a measure of relative sf within galaxies . to account for this ,",
    "we have removed early  type galaxies from our sample and repeated the ks tests from table  2 , obtaining significantly low @xmath25values of 0.022 and 0.018 for the distribution of ew(na ) and ew(ca ) , respectively .",
    "our main conclusion is that the distribution of ews from narrow blended na and ca lines differs significantly between sne ia with negative and positive @xmath0 . because the sign of @xmath0 should be purely geometrical , it should not correlate with any host galaxy or average sn properties .",
    "this suggests that part of the lines are formed by csm ejected by the progenitor before explosion , which is found asymmetrically distributed after explosion .",
    "the differences in color found for sne ia with different @xmath0 @xcite , which we confirm using snoopy and sifto light curve fitting , should be explained in part by extinction due to an asymmetric distribution of csm , and not by different ejecta temperatures with viewing angle alone .",
    "there are two possibilities to explain this result : 1 ) the csm material is asymmetrically ejected from the system _ before _ explosion and is aligned with the side of the ejecta where ignition occurs , or 2 ) the csm material is initially spherically symmetric and is affected by an asymmetric distortion _ after _",
    "explosion , which is stronger on the side where ignition occurs .    one possible physical process that could break the symmetry of the wd and have an effect on both the direction of ignition and the distribution of csm is rotation .",
    "however , rotation should produce cylindrically symmetric systems , where positive or negative @xmath6 should lead to the same average csm properties in the line of sight .",
    "another possibility is the gravitational field of a companion star , but the typical velocity offsets found for the absorbing material in @xcite implies that the material was ejected at a time before explosion much longer than the expected orbital period of the progenitor systems , again producing some cylindrical symmetry in average .",
    "thus , we conclude that only 2 ) is possible to explain our results . one way to produce an asymmetric distribution of dust , ew(na ) and ew(ca ) is to have an asymmetric ionizing field _",
    "after _ explosion .",
    "this would destroy most of the dust and ionize na and ca in the direction where ignition occurs . a comparison with pre  explosion images of the core ",
    "2012aw @xcite supports the idea of dramatic changes in extinction after explosion .",
    "the fact that the correlations are found to be stronger for dust ( colors ) than for ew(na ) and ew(ca ) is suggestive , since they are in ascending order of ionization potential .",
    "one problem with this interpretation could be the constraints in radio and x  ray for csm  ejecta interactions .",
    "this would be solved if the material were placed far enough from the ejecta , and only in some cases allow the ejecta to interact with the csm , as was seen in sn 2002ic , sn 2006x and 2007le , or if the measured ews are due to saturated lines in low mass , clumpy csm with a wide distribution of velocities .",
    "our results provide hints about the explosion asymmetry and csm properties of sn ia progenitors .",
    "if a larger sample confirms that most sne ia with @xmath1 have high ews of na and ca absorption lines , the majority of progenitors should contain significant csm .",
    "if this is the case , most sne ia with @xmath28 should have more strongly ionizing fields ( higher energy photons ) after explosion , either during shock breakout , or afterwards if more radioactive material is exposed in the ignition side of the explosion .",
    "finally , significant csm is consistent with some @xmath3sd or slow dd scenarios ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and not with violent dd scenarios .",
    "however , in our interpretation it is difficult to explain the sne ia with @xmath1 and low ews , which may suggest that multiple progenitor scenarios are at work .",
