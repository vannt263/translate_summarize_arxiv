    "i shall focus here on boltzmann s approach to the problem of the arrow of time : the origin of irreversible macroscopic laws , e.g. , and most importantly , the second law of thermodynamics  the law of increasing entropy  in the reversible laws of microscopic physics .",
    "i shall assume , as of course did boltzmann , a classical framework , for the most part ignoring quantum mechanics .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it is widely believed that the transition from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics requires no essential modification of boltzmann s ideas .",
    "this may well be so , but i believe that the traditional formulation of quantum theory is much too vague to permit any definitive conclusions on this matter .",
    "( for a non - traditional formulation of quantum mechanics that avoids its conceptual incoherence , a formulation which i quite naturally believe is well worth very serious consideration , see the contribution of detlef drr to this volume . )    for a more detailed presentation of much of what is discussed here , the reader should consult the excellent papers of joel lebowitz @xcite on this subject , as well as jean bricmont s sharp critique @xcite of some recent proposals .",
    "see also the contributions of bricmont and herbert spohn to this volume .",
    "most macroscopic phenomena are irreversible : they would look quite different , and in fact usually quite astonishing , if run backwards in time .",
    "consider for example the breaking of a glass , the boiling of an egg , birth and death . at a certain time a glass sits on a table ; at another time , a _ later _ time , what had been that glass now lies on the floor in a mess of tiny fragments . and corresponding to such irreversible phenomena there are irreversible equations and laws , for example the diffusion or heat equation , the navier - stokes equation , boltzmann s equation , and , perhaps most important for the issue at hand , the second law of thermodynamics , which can be regarded as lying behind the irreversibility of the irreversible macroscopic equations",
    ".    this irreversible behavior and these irreversible laws must somehow be a consequence of the ( more ) fundamental microscopic laws governing the behavior of the constituents of the systems obeying the irreversible laws .",
    "but these microscopic laws are symmetric under time reversal , and their solutions , run backwards in time , are also solutions .",
    "the correct detailed resolution of this apparent paradox was provided by boltzmann more than a century ago . and the essential idea was understood , by maxwell and lord kelvin , even earlier .",

    "the bursting bubble of foam at the foot of a waterfall would reunite and descend into the water ",
    "boulders would recover from the mud the materials required to rebuild them into their previous jagged forms , and would become reunited to the mountain peak from which they had formerly broken away . and if the materialistic hypothesis of life were true , living creatures would grow backwards , with conscious knowledge of the future , but no memory of the past , and would become again unborn .",
    "but the real phenomena of life infinitely transcend human science ",

    "nonetheless , the detailed solution found by boltzmann , based in part on his understanding of the microscopic meaning of entropy , was well appreciated and admired by many of his contemporaries .",
    "for example , towards the end of his life schrdinger @xcite reported that no perception in physics has ever seemed more important to me than that of boltzmann  despite planck and einstein .  in a more detailed assessment , schrdinger @xcite declared that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the spontaneous transition from order to disorder is the quintessence of boltzmann s theory ",
    "this theory really grants an understanding and does not ",
    "reason away the dissymetry of things by means of an a priori sense of direction of time   no one who has once understood boltzmann s theory will ever again have recourse to such expedients .",
    "it would be a scientific regression beside which a repudiation of copernicus in favor of ptolemy would seem trifling .",

    "in fact schrdinger concluded the statement that i ve just quoted with the observation that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ nevertheless , objections to the theory have been raised again and again in the course of past decades and not ( only ) by fools but ( also ) by fine thinkers .",
    "if we   eliminate the subtle misunderstandings   we   find   a significant residue   which needs exploring ",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    notice schrdinger s parenthetical comments , suggesting that he did not have a very high opinion of most of the objections that continued to be raised against boltzmann s ideas .",
    "note also his separation of a residual core of confusion from what was regarded  or",
    "should have been  as settled .    roughly corresponding to this separation",
    ", the problem of irreversibility can be regarded as having two parts : an easy part and a hard part . for many physicists who find boltzmann s solution inadequate ,",
    "it is only the hard part  that causes them trouble .",
    "however , for a great many others even the easy part  seems hard , and generates an enormous amount of confusion .",
    "moreover , even with the solution to both parts of the problem , there are still questions , of a philosophical character , that remain .",
    "these questions , touched upon in section 4 , could be regarded as defining the really hard part of the problem .",
    "but it would be better to see them , not so much as part of the problem of irreversibility , but rather as general questions about the meaning and nature of scientific explanation .",
    "boltzmann s great achievement was to arrive at an understanding of the meaning of entropy and why it should tend to increase , almost never decreasing .",
    "this understanding is such as also to explain why systems evolve to equilibrium states , of maximal entropy .",
    "consider , for example the sequence of snapshots of a gas in a box illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "we see here the transition from a low entropy nonequilibrium state on the left , with the gas entirely on the bottom of the box , through states of higher entropy , with the gas expanding into the full box , until at the right we have a high entropy equilibrium state with the gas uniformly distributed throughout the box .",
    "the question that boltzmann addressed is quite simple and straightforward : why does the gas prefer to be in equilibrium  that is , to look like the snapshot on the right ?",
    "the answer that he found is , perhaps , even simpler but also , somehow , rather subtle .",
    "a complete description of the state of the gas is provided by its _ phase point _",
    "@xmath1 , a point in the phase space of possible microscopic states of the gas .",
    "many different phase points correspond to each of the snapshots in fig .  1 .",
    "there is nothing particularly special about any specific _ equilibrium phase point _  a phase point corresponding to the snapshot on the right , a system in equilibrium .",
    "the dynamics prefers a given equilibrium phase point neither more nor less than it prefers any other given phase point , even a specific far - from - equilibrium phase point , corresponding say to the leftmost snapshot .",
    "there are , however , for a system at a given energy @xmath2 , far more equilibrium phase points than nonequilibrium phase points , overwhelming more , in fact , than the totality of nonequilibrium phase points at that energy  corresponding to all possible ways the system can fail to be in equilibrium , and described , for example , by the various density distributions perceptibly different from the uniform one .",
    "the only relevant sense in which the equilibrium phase points could be regarded as special is that there are vastly more of them .",
    "i shall now sketch boltzmann s account of why this should be so , indicating the central role of entropy and its meaning in providing a quantitative foundation for what i ve just described .",
    "a crucial ingredient in this account is the vast separation of scales between the microscopic and the macroscopic levels , without which irreversible phenomena could not possibly emerge from reversible microscopic laws .",
    "consider the microscopic state @xmath3 of a classical system consisting of a large number @xmath4 of identical particles forming a gas in a box @xmath5 , with positions @xmath6 and momenta @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution of the system is determined , via hamilton s equations of motion @xmath8 , by a hamiltonian function @xmath9 , the energy function for the system , normally assumed to be the sum of a kinetic energy term and a potential energy term but whose form shall not much concern us here . since the energy is a constant of this motion , we may take as the relevant set of possible states , not the full phase space @xmath10 of the system under consideration but the energy surface @xmath11 corresponding to the value @xmath2 of the energy of the system .    each snapshot in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to a subset @xmath12 of @xmath13 , namely the set of all phase points that look like  the snapshot .",
    "every phase point @xmath1 belongs to a macrostate @xmath14 consisting of phase points that are macroscopically similar to @xmath1 . more precisely ,",
    "partition the 1-particle phase space ( the @xmath15  space ) into macroscopically small but microscopically large cells @xmath16 and specify ( approximately , by providing intervals ) the number @xmath17 of particles in each cell .",
    "each such specification determines a _ macrostate _ , the set of all phase points whose particles are distributed in the manner specified .",
    "different specifications yield different macrostates and the set of all such macrostates defines a partition of our phase space @xmath13 , into macrostates .",
    "@xmath14 is then the macrostate  the element of this partition  to which @xmath1 belongs .",
    "all points in @xmath14 have , in particular , similar spatial particle densities ( and similar bulk - velocity profiles ) .",
    "different macrostates typically have vastly different sizes , and this difference is conveniently quantified by _",
    "boltzmann s entropy _ :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant , expressing the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic units , and @xmath20 denotes volume , given by the time - invariant projection of the liouville ( lebesgue ) measure onto @xmath13 .",
    "( the definition ( [ entropy ] ) is correct up to an additive constant , depending on @xmath4 , that is important but shall not concern us here . ) following boltzmann , let us identify boltzmann s entropy with the thermodynamic entropy , to which the second law refers . then that we should expect entropy to increase  but for exceedingly rare exceptions never decreasing  more or less directly follows from the very concept ( [ entropy ] ) of entropy once the vast separation of scales between the microscopic and the macroscopic levels is taken into account .",
    "this is because the entropy @xmath21 is an extensive variable , proportional to the number @xmath4 of particles in the system .",
    "in fact , the log  in ( [ entropy ] ) suggests that the various possible values of @xmath22 need to be measured on a logarithmic scale , these values differing so greatly that without taking the logarithm it would be difficult to place them on the same scale or graph . with the logarithm , an extensive quantity is obtained , and after dividing by the spatial volume of the system we obtain an entropy per unit volume whose differences , for different macrostates , are of order unity .",
    "what all of this means is that typical values of @xmath22 , and , more to the point , typical ratios of such values , for example between the value of @xmath22 for the equilibrium state depicted in the snapshot on the right of fig .",
    "1 and the value for any nonequilibrium state , say the one depicted on the left , are of order ",
    "@xmath23 , or , more explicitly , of order @xmath24 for a system with @xmath25 particles .",
    "( that this is the correct order is easily seen by noting that when the condition that all particles be on the left side of the box is dropped , the volume of the set of all possible phase points consistent with the constraints increases by a factor of @xmath26  a factor of 2 for each of the particles . note also that in terms of the sense of order ",
    "appropriate for comparing quantities as vast as those under consideration here , of order @xmath24  should not be regarded as different from of order @xmath27 .  )    thus @xmath13 consists almost entirely of phase points in the equilibrium macrostate @xmath28 , with ridiculously few exceptions whose totality has volume of order @xmath29 relative to that of @xmath13 . for a nonequilibrium phase point @xmath1 of energy @xmath2",
    ", the hamiltonian dynamics governing the motion @xmath30 arising from @xmath1 would have to be ridiculously special to avoid reasonably quickly carrying @xmath30 into @xmath28 and keeping it there for an extremely long time  unless , of course , @xmath1 itself were ridiculously special .",
    "zermelo and loschmidt claimed that boltzmann s analysis , showing how irreversible macroscopic behavior emerges from reversible microscopic laws , was  and had to be ",
    "loschmidt noted that since the classical equations of motion are time - reversible , we may obtain solutions @xmath30 to these equations that violate the macroscopic laws by time - reversing solutions that obey them , thereby obtaining , for example , a solution which runs through the snapshots in fig .",
    "1 in time - reversed order , right to left . and",
    "zermelo pointed out that there is another reason why such anti - thermodynamic solutions must exist : poincar recurrence , which guarantees that most solutions ( the exceptions have , in fact , at most measure 0 ) that initially belong to the macrostate depicted in the left snapshot will eventually return to that macrostate .",
    "it thus follows that anti - thermodynamic behavior is just as consistent with the microscopic laws as thermodynamic behavior ( which is of course obvious in view of the reversibility of those laws ) , so that neither , in fact , could be a consequence of those laws .",
    "however , no genuine conflict with the analysis of boltzmann follows from these objections .",
    "boltzmann did not ( finally ) claim that all phase points should behave properly , but only that by far most of them  in any given macrostate and in the sense of volume relative to that of the macrostate ",
    "some may behave improperly , and the arguments of zermelo and loschmidt merely show that such bad phase points in fact exist .",
    "for example , from loschmidt we know that we may obtain such points by reversing the velocities of the equilibrium phase points to which nonequilibrium phase points ( reasonably quickly ) evolve .    here is part of boltzmann s response to zermelo @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i have",
    "  emphasized that the second law of thermodynamics is from the molecular viewpoint merely a statistical law .",
    "zermelo s paper shows that my writings have been misunderstood ; ",
    "poincar s theorem , which zermelo explains at the beginning of his paper , is clearly correct , but his application of it to the theory of heat is not .",
    " thus , when zermelo concludes , from the theoretical fact that the initial states in a gas must recur  without having calculated how long a time this will take  that the hypotheses of gas theory must be rejected or else fundamentally changed , he is just like a dice player who has calculated that the probability of a sequence of 1000 one s is not zero , and then concludes that his dice must be loaded since he has not yet observed such a sequence ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      the basic notions of ergodic theory , in particular ergodicity and mixing , are widely believed to play a crucial role in the foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "ergodicity , roughly speaking the absence of constants of the motion other than functions of the energy @xmath31 , implies the equality of time - averages and phase - space averages , i.e. , of the long - time average of a quantity as it changes under the dynamics and the uniform average of that quantity , over the relevant energy surface @xmath13 , as the phase point at which it is evaluated varies over that surface .",
    "this is supposed to justify the use , to define the equilibrium values of thermodynamic quantities , of such phase - space averages with respect to the _ microcanonical ensemble _ , the uniform distribution over the energy surface , the idea being that the observed values of these quantities are time - averages , since measurement takes time .",
    "this use of ergodicity is thoroughly misguided .",
    "boltzmann s key insight was that , given the energy of a system , the overwhelming majority of its phase points on the corresponding energy surface are equilibrium phase points , all of which look macroscopically more or less the same .",
    "this means that the value of any thermodynamic quantity is , to all intents and purposes , constant on the energy surface , and averaging over the energy surface will thus reproduce that constant value , regardless of whether or not the system is ergodic .    for example , one characteristic shared by the equilibrium phase points , and thus by the great majority of phase points on the energy surface , is a common maxwellian empirical distribution for the velocities . here again is boltzmann @xcite , expressing his frustration with zermelo for failing , it seems , to appreciate that fact :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ the maxwell distribution ] is characterized by the fact that by far the largest number of possible velocity distributions have the characteristic properties of the maxwell distribution , and compared to these there are only a relatively small number of possible distributions that deviate significantly from maxwell s . whereas zermelo says that the number of states that finally lead to the maxwellian state is small compared to all possible states , i assert on the contrary that by far the largest number of possible states are `` maxwellian '' and that the number that deviate from the maxwellian state is vanishingly small . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    there is another problem with this use of ergodicity , a mismatch of time scales .",
    "the time scale appropriate for the ergodicity of a gas in a box is , roughly speaking , the time necessary for a trajectory for the motion in phase space to wind all over the phase space , and this is at least as long as a poincar recurrence time , the time necessary for the gas , say after leaving the state depicted in the left snapshot in fig .  1 , to return to that state , a time as large as the corresponding microstate is small and hence of order @xmath24 in your favorite unit of time , a time far far larger than that believed to be the age of the universe , since the big bang",
    ". thus ergodicity could nt possibly be very relevant to an account of phenomena , such as those with which thermodynamics is concerned , taking place on reasonable time scales .",
    "mixing is supposed to explain why systems evolve to a state of equilibrium .",
    "the idea here is that since such a state is in a sense characterized by a special probability distribution , namely the microcanonical ensemble , evolution to equilibrium amounts to the convergence of a generic ( nonequilibrium ) distribution to the special one , under the dynamics on probabilities arising from the phase - space motion .",
    "but this , made suitably precise , amounts to the assertion that the system is ( a ) _ mixing _ ( system ) , this terminology referring to the fact that the notion is usually defined by the following ( equivalent ) property of the dynamics : the points of any region @xmath32  of nonvanishing volume , no matter how small  of the energy surface will evolve under the dynamics , after a suitably long time @xmath33 , to points that fill out a region @xmath34 that is distorted and convoluted in such a way as to be spread more or less uniformly throughout the energy surface , in the sense that for any reasonable function @xmath35 , the uniform averages of @xmath35 over @xmath13 and over @xmath34 are more or less the same .    since the energy surface @xmath13 consists almost entirely of a single macrostate , the equilibrium macrostate @xmath28 , the mixing property of the evolution on the energy surface pretty much amounts to the condition that ( even small ) subregions of @xmath28 become uniformly spread over @xmath28 after a sufficiently long time . but",
    "this could not possibly be relevant to the problem of approach to equilibrium , since it concerns only phase points that describe a system that is already in equilibrium .",
    "approach to equilibrium concerns the passage of a nonequilibrium phase point , lying outside of @xmath28 , into @xmath28 , and this tends to happen , in fact typically rather quickly , merely because @xmath28 is so extremely large .",
    "( note , however , that although mixing is a much stronger property of the dynamics than ergodicity , the mixing time scale could be much smaller than that for ergodicity , and could in fact be of the same order as the time required for a system to reach equilibrium . )",
    "this abuse of mixing is so obviously wrong - headed that one ca nt help wondering about the sources of the confusion . here are two possibilities :    one of the most widely mentioned metaphors for mixing , invoked by gibbs @xcite when he introduced the notion , is the spreading of a tiny ink drop when it is placed in a glass of water and the water is stirred .",
    "the spreading of the ink all over the water is also an example of approach to equilibrium .",
    "however , it is important to bear in mind that insofar as it illustrates mixing , this example should be regarded as having as its phase space the points of the liquid , a three - dimensional set , whereas the relevant phase space for the approach to equilibrium in the example is the set of configurations of the liquid , describing how the ink is distributed in the water , a space of enormous dimension .",
    "the sort of mixing that can be relevant to approach to equilibrium takes place in physical space , not in phase space .    a related point : there is a quantity of a probablistic character whose approach to equilibrium for a low density gas does reflect , famously and correctly , that of the system .",
    "i have in mind here , of course , the one - particle boltzmann function @xmath36 , whose approach to equilibrium is governed by boltzmann s equation and which describes the empirical distribution , or coarse - grained density , of the particles of the gas in the one - particle phase space .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath37 , since it is an empirical distribution , is determined by the state of the system , given by a point @xmath1 in its full phase space .",
    "@xmath37 can in fact be regarded as describing a macrostate of the system by using it to specify , up to a constant of proportionality , the numbers @xmath17 defining the macrostate ; see the paragraph preceding the one containing equation [ entropy ] .",
    "this legitimate association of approach to equilibrium for the system with the approach of @xmath35 to an equilibrium distribution , maxwellian in velocity and spatially homogeneous , has unfortunately suggested to many that approach to equilibrium for a more general gas should be identified with the convergence of the full @xmath38-particle distribution function to one that is constant on the relevant energy surface , describing the microcanonical ensemble  in a word , mixing .",
    "but the @xmath38-particle distribution function is not an empirical distribution and , unlike @xmath37 , is not merely a characteristic of the actual state @xmath1 of the gas .",
    "another source of confusion lies in the widespread tendency to identify states of a physical system with probability measures on its phase space , a tendency partly owing to the very success achieved by statistical mechanics through the use of statistical methods in general , and the standard ensembles in particular ; and partly owing to the baleful influence of quantum mechanics , one of the main lessons of which is all too widely believed to be that a detailed description of a quantum mechanical system is fundamentally impossible , so that the state of such a system must be identified with an object of a statistical character , be it the wave function of the system or a positive linear functional on its algebra of observables .",
    "the identification of the state of a system with a probability measure , given , say , by a density @xmath0 on its phase space , has led to the widespread identification of the thermodynamic entropy of a system with its _ gibbs entropy _ : @xmath39 one of the most important features of the gibbs entropy is that it is a constant of the motion : writing @xmath40 for the evolution on densities induced by the motion on phase space , we have that @xmath41 is independent of @xmath33 ; in particular it does not increase to its equilibrium value .",
    "it is frequently asked how this can be compatible with the second law .",
    "the answer is very simple .",
    "the second law is concerned with the thermodynamic entropy , and this is given by boltzmann s entropy ( [ entropy ] ) , not by the gibbs entropy ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "in fact , the gibbs entropy is not even an entity of the right sort : it is a function of a probability distribution , i.e. , of an ensemble of systems , and not a function on phase space , a function of the actual state @xmath1 of an individual system , the behavior of which the second law  and macro - physics in general  is supposed to describe .    the widespread tendency to identify the thermodynamic entropy with the gibbs entropy rather than with boltzmann s entropy , while clearly misguided , is easy to understand .",
    "boltzmann s entropy is a bit vague , since it depends upon somewhat arbitrary choices that go into the specification of the macrostates of a system , and , other things being equal , vagueness is bad .",
    "this vagueness , however , is of little practical consequence , and indeed upon reflection is quite appropriate for the problem of defining entropy , a concept that somehow relates the microscopic level of description and the ( not sharply definable ) macroscopic level .",
    "but the vagueness is there nonetheless .    unlike boltzmann s entropy",
    ", the gibbs entropy is sharply defined , without arbitrariness .",
    "it is also a very natural functional of a probability distribution , having a great many useful and appealing features into which i shall not enter here .",
    "it is the basis of extremely important developments in information theory and in the ergodic theory of dynamical systems , and has proven to be of great value in the derivation of hydrodynamical laws from suitable microscopic first principles .",
    "it is a very fine concept and can be used to define a great many things , but thermodynamic entropy is not one of them .    certainly contributing to the tendency to identify the thermodynamic entropy with the gibbs entropy",
    "is the fact that for systems in equilibrium the gibbs entropy agrees with boltzmann s entropy .",
    "more precisely , and more generally ,",
    "@xmath42 whenever @xmath0 is the uniform distribution over the macrostate to which @xmath1 belongs . moreover  and this is probably the origin of the confusion ",
    "boltzmann showed that for a low density gas @xmath43 whenever @xmath1 belongs to the macrostate defined by the boltzmann function @xmath36 .",
    "this formula involves the gibbs entropy for the one - particle distribution @xmath35 and is appropriate , as mentioned , for a low density gas , in which correlations between particles are insignificant .",
    "this has suggested to many that to obtain an expression for entropy valid beyond the low density regime one should apply a similar formula to the full probability distribution , capturing all the correlations then present .",
    "the result , of course , is the gibbs entropy ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "the mistake in doing so lies in failing to appreciate that it is the left hand side of ( [ bg ] ) , defined by ( [ entropy ] ) , that is fundamental , not the right hand side , which is merely the result of a computation valid in a special situation .    it is widely believed that thermodynamic entropy is a reflection of our ignorance of the precise microscopic state of a macroscopic system , and that if we somehow knew the exact phase point for the system , its entropy would be zero or meaningless .",
    "but entropy is a quantity playing a precise role in a formalism governing an aspect of the behavior of macroscopic systems .",
    "this behavior is completely determined by the evolution of the detailed microscopic state of these systems , regardless of what any person or any other being happens to know about that state .",
    "the widespread acceptance of the preposterous notion that how macroscopic systems behave could be affected merely by what we know about them is simply another instance of the distressing effect that quantum mechanics has had upon the ability of physicists to think clearly about fundamental issues in physics .",
    "in the previous section we addressed the easy part of the problem of irreversibility : suppose a system , e.g. , a gas in a box , is in a state of low entropy at some time .",
    "why should its entropy tend to be larger at a later time ?",
    "the reason is basically that states of large entropy correspond to regions in phase space of enormously greater volume than those of lower entropy .",
    "we now turn to the hard part of the problem : why should there be an arrow of time in our universe , governed as it is , at the fundamental level , by reversible microscopic laws ?",
    "the problem here can be appreciated by focusing on the question : what is the origin of the low entropy initial states ? if they are so `` unlikely , '' why should systems find themselves in such states ?",
    "in many cases , the answer is that we or an experimenter created them , from states of lower entropy still . if we continue to ask such questions , we come to the conclusion that the cause of low entropy states on earth , the source in effect of negative entropy , is our sun , whose high energy photons",
    "are absorbed by the earth , which converts them to a great many low energy photons ( having together much larger entropy ) , permitting entropy - decreasing processes to occur on our planet without violation of overall entropy non - decrease . and if we push further we eventually arrive at a cosmological low entropy state , in the distant past , for the universe as a whole .",
    "and what about the origin of this state ?",
    "figure  2 , taken from roger penrose s _ the emperor s new mind _",
    "@xcite , illustrates the difficulty .     of the entire volume , for the situation under consideration .",
    "( the pin , and the spot aimed for , are not drawn to scale ! ) ]    penrose estimates the volume of the region of phase space corresponding to the possible initial states of the universe to be one part in @xmath44 of the entire relevant phase space .",
    "he bases this upon the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a @xmath45 baryon mass black hole , which , in natural units, is @xmath46 , corresponding to a big crunch state of volume of order @xmath44 , a reasonable estimate , penrose argues , for the volume of the entire relevant phase space for a closed universe .",
    "( it does not much matter what we take as the entropy of the initial state , be it @xmath47 or @xmath48 or @xmath49  the relevant ratio of volumes will always be of order @xmath44 .",
    "as to whether @xmath44 is indeed a good estimate for the volume of the relevant phase space , it has been suggested that @xmath50 might be more on target ; see the contribution of michael kiessling to this volume . )    as to why the universe should have begun in such an exceedingly improbable macrostate , an answer that has often been suggested is that such a state arose from a fluctuation out of equilibrium .",
    "in fact , if the universal dynamics were ergodic , such a fluctuation must eventually occur , repeatedly , for all phase points with the possible exception of a set of measure 0 .",
    "nonetheless , this answer is quite unsatisfactory ; indeed , according to feynman @xcite it is ridiculous .  the problem is that if the explanation of entropy increase and the arrow of time in our universe is that they have emerged from a low entropy state that arose from a fluctuation , then that fluctuation should have been no larger than necessary  that is , to a state like the present state of the universe , and not to a state of much lower entropy as seems to have existed in the past .",
    "here is feynman , referring to astronomy , to history books and history , and to paleontology :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ since we always make the prediction that in a place where we have not looked we shall see stars in a similar condition , or find the same statement about napoleon , or that we shall see bones like the bones that we have seen before , the success of all those sciences indicates that the world did not come from a fluctuation ",
    "therefore i think it is necessary to add to the physical laws the hypothesis that in the past the universe was more ordered ",

    "this hypothesis must imply that this state had very low entropy , but , unlike feynman s suggestion above , it need not explicitly stipulate that this be so .",
    "what is required is that the initial state not be too contrived , that it be somehow reasonable , indeed that it be natural .",
    "moreover , it seems that gravity , even classical gravity , affords just such a possibility .",
    "this is because the attractive nature of the gravitational interaction is such that gravitating matter tends to clump , clumped states having larger entropy .",
    "( for more on this see the contribution of michael kiessling to this volume . )",
    "this important difference from the behavior of ordinary matter , for which gravity can be more or less ignored , is well illustrated by penrose in @xcite , see fig .",
    "what is important for our purposes here is that what is arguably the most random , typical , natural , and least contrived initial state for a system of gravitating particles , one in which they are uniformly distributed over space ( with , say , all of them at rest ) also happens to be a state of very low entropy , exactly what is needed to complete boltzmann s account of irreversibility .",
    "according to the boltzmannian scenario propounded here , the overwhelming majority , as measured by relative phase - space volume , of phase points in a ( very small ) initial macrostate of the universe evolve in such a way as to behave  for reasonable times , that are not too large on the time scale defined by the present age of the universe , since the big bang  thermodynamically , with suitably closed subsystems having increasing entropy , exhibiting irreversible behavior , and so on .",
    "in other words , _ typical _ phase space points yield the behavior that it was our ( or boltzmann s ) purpose to explain .",
    "thus we should expect such behavior to be prevail in our universe .",
    "this raises the question , what is the force of such an explanation , based , as it is , merely on what would `` typically '' happen , not on what must inevitably happen ?",
    "now , as a scientist i see no problem here",
    ". what more could reasonably be expected by way of explanation ?",

",
    "despite this , every insurance company relies on probability theory . ",
    "the assumption that these rare cases are not observed in nature is not strictly provable ( nor is the entire mechanical picture itself ) but in view of what has been said it is so natural and obvious , and so much in agreement with all experience with probabilities ,  that any doubt on this point certainly can not put in question the validity of the theory when it is otherwise so useful .",
    "it is completely incomprehensible to me how anyone can see a refutation of the applicability of probability theory in the fact that some other argument shows that exceptions must occur now and then over a period of eons of time ; for probability theory itself teaches just the same thing . _",

    "the point is that in science , as in life , we must learn to cope with uncertainty . as boltzmann noted in the above quotation",
    ", the mechanical picture itself is not strictly provable . nor is any other scientific theory .",
    "no matter how strongly a particular theory seems to be supported by the evidence at hand , there are always logically possible alternative accounts of the very same evidence , however far fetched these may be .",
    "the account that we tend to believe  what we consider to be the inference to the best explanation  seems to us simpler , more elegant , more natural , and certainly less contrived , than the alternatives .",
    "nonetheless , our expectations for future behavior , based on the best available evidence , can never be regarded as inevitable consequences of that evidence , but only  at best  as overwhelming likely .    with regard to probablistic or statistical explanations , involving uncertainty about initial conditions",
    ", we say that a phenomenon has been explained if it holds for _ typical _ initial conditions , that is with rare exceptions as defined by a suitable measure ",
    "@xmath51 of typicality .",
    "the phenomenon has been explained if the set @xmath2 of exceptional initial conditions satisfies @xmath52 .",
    "of course it is essential that the measure of typicality be natural and not contrived .",
    "it should be an object that could , somehow , have been agreed upon before the phenomenon to be explained was even considered . for dynamical systems such as we are discussing here , the measure of typicality should be naturally related to the dynamics , and the most common such condition is that of stationarity .",
    "after all , our notion of typicality should not change with time . and for classical mechanics , for which symplectic or canonical structure plays a crucial role in the dynamics , the most natural measure is the volume measure defined by the symplectic coordinates , the measure we have been invoking throughout this article .    here is a small point , but one worth making if we intend to worry a bit about the justification of explanation via typicality : while typicality is usually defined  as it was here  in terms of a probability measure , the basic concept is not genuinely probablistic , but rather a less detailed concept .",
    "a measure @xmath51 of typicality need not be countably additive , nor even finitely additive .",
    "moreover , for any event @xmath2 , if @xmath51 is merely a measure of typicality , there is no point worrying about , nor any sense to , the question as to the real meaning of say @xmath53. distinctions such as between @xmath53 and @xmath54 are distinctions without a difference .",
    "the only thing that matters for a measure @xmath51 of typicality is @xmath55 : a measure of typicality plays solely the role of informing us when a set @xmath2 of exceptions is sufficiently small that we may in effect ignore it and regard the phenomenon in question , occurring off the set @xmath2 , as having been explained .",
    "and our future expectation is for behavior that is typical in this sense .",
    "after all , our firm belief in the impossibility of perpetual motion machines is not based primarily on the fact that none has ever been achieved so much as on boltzmann s account of why such a machine would be a practical impossibility .",
    "what i ve just described is the calculus of explanation via appeal to typicality .",
    "the rigorous justification of such a calculus is , as i ve already indicated , another matter entirely , a problem , like so many similar problems involving crucial uncertainty , of extraordinary difficulty . to begin to address this problem",
    "we would have to investigate how explanation and typicality are related , which would of course require that we analyze exactly what is meant by explanation and by typicality. if typicality is not probability  the explication of which is itself a controversial problem of immense difficulty  it would help to be aware of this from the outset .",
