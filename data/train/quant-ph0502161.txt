    "in the last twenty years the attention of researchers of several different areas has been attracted towards quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "this field of knowledge presents new scientific challenges both from the theoretical and the experimental points of view .",
    "part of the theoretical challenge is to learn how to work with quantum properties to obtain new and more efficient algorithms .",
    "a quantum algorithm can be seen as a definite sequence of unitary transformations acting over a quantum state , in some hilbert space .",
    "its size is proportional to the number of elementary unitary transformations of which the algorithm is composed .",
    "concepts like interference phenomena , quantum measurements , resonances , quantum parallelism , amplification techniques , etc . , are employed by this new computation science . however",
    ", relatively few quantum algorithms were created ; among them , shor s and grover s  @xcite algorithms are the best known .",
    "shor s algorithm decomposes a number in its prime factors more efficiently than any known classical algorithm .",
    "to achieve this it uses quantum parallelism , quantum fourier transforms , and the properties of quantum measurements .",
    "grover s search algorithm locates a marked item in an unsorted list of @xmath1 elements in a number of steps proportional to @xmath0 , instead of @xmath3 as in the classical case .",
    "it performs a unitary transformation of the quantum state which increases the likelihood that the marked state of interest will be measured at the output ( amplification technique ) .",
    "it has been proven that there are neither quantum nor classical algorithms that can perform faster such an unstructured search  @xcite .    in this work we present a continuous time quantum search algorithm , which is controlled by a time dependent hamiltonian . in particular there are not unitary operators that are applied at certain time steps , as in grover s algorithm .",
    "unlike other authors  @xcite who studied continuous time search algorithms , the most relevant characteristic of our model is the use of quantum resonances , showing explicitly grover s assertion that his algorithm is a resonance phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "we should remark that a suggestion to employ resonances in quantum computing was made by m. zak in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we develop the continuous time search model . in section 3",
    "we present examples of use of this model for two typical hamiltonians .",
    "then we show , in section 4 , the connection of this continuous time with a discrete time search algorithm . in the last section ,",
    "we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the evolution of the wavefunction @xmath4 satisfies the schrdinger equation , @xmath5    where @xmath6 and we have taken planck s constant @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is a known nondegenerate time - independent hamiltonian with a discrete energy spectrum , and @xmath9 is a time dependent potential that will be defined below .",
    "we should point out that the extension to the degenerate case is quite straightforward , as in the case of grover s algorithm for several equally marked items .",
    "let us consider the normalized eigenstates @xmath10 and eigenvalues @xmath11 for the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "these sets can be finite or infinite , depending on the nature of @xmath8 .",
    "we now consider a subset * n * of @xmath12 formed by @xmath1 elements on which we shall apply the search algorithm . we take a known eigenstate @xmath13 , with eigenvalue @xmath14 , as the initial state of the system .",
    "this initial state does not belong to the search set *",
    "n*.    let us call @xmath15 the unknown searched state whose energy @xmath16 is known .",
    "this knowledge is equivalent to ` mark ' the searched state in grover s algorithm .",
    "our task is to find the eigenvector @xmath15 which transition energy from a given initial state @xmath13 is @xmath17 .",
    "we propose the following potential @xmath18 , which , as it may be easily verified , produces a resonance between the initial and the searched states ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is an unitary vector , that can be interpreted as the average of the set of vectors * n*. this definition assures that the interaction potential @xmath18 is hermitian , that the transition probabilities from state @xmath13 to any state of the set * n * are all equal , @xmath21 , and finally that the sum of the transition probabilities verifies @xmath22 .",
    "let us express @xmath4 as an expansion in the eigenstates @xmath23 of @xmath8 , @xmath24 , where the expansion coefficients depend on time . replacing the above expression of @xmath4 in eq.([schrodinger ] )",
    ", we obtain the following set of equations for the amplitudes @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 are the bohr frequencies . combining eqs.([potential ] ) and ( [ dynamics ] ) , we find , @xmath28 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; and@xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\makebox[2.5cm]{}\\left .",

    "note that there are two time scales involved , a fast scale associated to the bohr frequencies , and a slow scale associated to the amplitudes @xmath34 .",
    "integrating the previous equations in a time interval greater than the fast scale , the most important terms are those that have a very small phase , as the others average to zero . in this approximation",
    "the previous set of equations becomes @xmath35 these equations represent two oscillators that are coupled so that their population probabilities alternate in time .",
    "as we notice the coupling is established between the initial and the searched for state .",
    "solving those equations with initial conditions @xmath36 , @xmath37 we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "it is important to notice that this approach is valid only if all the bohr frequencies verify @xmath40 .",
    "if we let the system evolve during a time @xmath41 , and we make a measurement immediately after that , the probability to obtain the searched state is one . for the case",
    "that the previous approximations are true , our method behaves qualitatively like grover s , but the time @xmath42 is twice the search time of grover s algorithm @xcite .",
    "this difference is not relevant since the resonance potential eq.([potential ] ) can be renormalized with a constant factor @xmath43 as long as it does not invalidate the previous approximations , @xmath40 , where now @xmath44 .",
    "we have integrated numerically eqs.([dynamics1 ] ) and ( [ dynamics2 ] ) for two hamiltonians @xmath8 , namely for the quantum harmonic oscillator and for the quantum rotor in 2d .",
    "the eigenvalues for these hamiltonians are @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . in both cases",
    "we take @xmath47 and initial conditions @xmath36 , @xmath48 , for all @xmath30 .",
    "the calculations were performed using a standard fourth order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "choosing an arbitrary eigenvalue for the energy of the searched state , we follow the dynamics of the set * n*. we have verified , for several values of @xmath1 , that the most important coupling is between the initial and the searched state , other couplings being negligible , as discussed in the previous section .    .",
    "the initial state was taken to be @xmath49 , and the searched state @xmath50 .",
    "the full line shows the probability of the initial and the searched state .",
    "for all the others states of the set the probabilities take negligible values . ]    the probability distribution of the search set and the initially loaded state are shown for the rotor case in fig.[evol ] .",
    "each panel shows the probability distribution at different times .",
    "it is clear that the total probability flows between the initial and the searched states .",
    "there is a characteristic time at which the probability of the searched state is maximum and its value is very near one .",
    "this time agrees with our theoretical prediction , @xmath42 .",
    "fig.[rotator ] shows the oscillation of the probability flux between the initial and the searched states as a function of time for the quantum rotor .",
    "the temporal evolution was normalized for the characteristic time @xmath42 .",
    "fig.[osarm ] shows a similar calculation for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "here we have considered three sizes for the data set .",
    "note two remarkable differences between figs.[rotator ] and [ osarm ] : for the rotor the maximum values of the probabilities are one , while for the harmonic oscillator they are less than one , and decrease with time .",
    "furthermore , while for the rotor the maxima are located in agreement with the theoretical prediction , for the harmonic oscillator the maxima show an increasing shift to the right of the predicted values as the search algorithm evolves .",
    "the differences between the two hamiltonians mentioned above are due to the properties of their respective energy spectra : while the energy eigenvalues of the rotor increase quadratically with the quantum number , for the harmonic oscillator they increase linearly .",
    "consequently , the condition @xmath51 , is better satisfied for the spectrum of the rotor than for the harmonic oscillator . as a consequence",
    "the agreement with the theoretical approximation is worse in this last case .",
    "however , as @xmath39 , if the size of the data set is increased , the agreement for the harmonic oscillator with the behavior predicted by eq.([psearched ] ) is much improved , as shown in fig.[osarm ] .",
    "increasing @xmath1 leads to a decrease in the relative distance between the energy spectrum values of @xmath8 , allowing for a better resolution . in general , for a given hamiltonian @xmath8 with a discrete energy spectrum , the improvement obtained increasing @xmath1 becomes negligible after some saturation value . above this saturation value the algorithm presented here , has the same characteristics as grover s algorithm .     in the case of a data",
    "set of size @xmath52     as a function of time .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the initial state and the full line to the searched state .",
    "the size of the searched set are : ( a ) @xmath53 , ( b ) @xmath54 , ( c ) @xmath55 ]    the proportionality between the characteristic time @xmath42 and @xmath0 for the rotor and the harmonic oscillator , is verified in fig.[period ] .",
    "at which the probability of the searched state is maximum as a function of the square root of the dimension of the search set .",
    "squares correspond to the harmonic oscillator , and circles to the rotor . ]",
    "+ taking @xmath1 greater than its saturation value , one can test the robustness of this search algorithm with respect to imprecisions in the eigenvalue of the searched state .",
    "let us replace @xmath56 by @xmath57 in eqs.([dynamics2 ] ) , where we take @xmath58 smaller than @xmath59 .    within the this approximation",
    "the probability of the searched state evaluated in @xmath60 is , @xmath61 ^{2}.\\label{senoc}\\ ] ] we define the resonance width @xmath62 , as the value of @xmath58 for which the probability of the searched state falls to half of the value for @xmath63 .",
    ", for the rotor , with @xmath64 ( dashed line ) and @xmath65 ( full line ) .",
    "@xmath62 is the width of the resonance . ]",
    "+   + the calculation of the probability of the searched state as a function of @xmath58 is presented in fig.[width ] .",
    "it can be observed that the curves are in agreement with eq.([senoc ] ) , showing a symmetrical behavior about @xmath63 and a sharpness that depends on @xmath1 . for small @xmath58",
    "the probability of the searched state remains large enough .",
    "then , we deduce that a small error in @xmath56 does not affect drastically the search algorithm . +    .",
    "the points are results of the numerical calculation .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the linear regression of the data . ]",
    "+ the dependence of the resonance width with @xmath1 is presented in fig .",
    "[ hyperbola ] .",
    "the numerical calculation fits with a hyperbola defined by @xmath66 .",
    "this result is in agreement with eq.([senoc ] ) when @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "we now build a discrete version of the continuous time algorithm developed in the previous sections .",
    "note that the time @xmath42 can be expressed by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the period of interaction potential , eq.([potential ] ) .",
    "then one can use floquet s theory @xcite to obtain the matrix of the floquet evolution operator @xmath71 . if one defines an unitary evolution operator @xmath72 , the searched state is obtained by applying @xmath73 @xmath74 times to the initial state .",
    "if @xmath75 is not an integer number , we round it to the nearest integer in the definition of @xmath73 . + to construct the floquet operator , we must look for the amplitudes of the floquet states that are also solutions of the eqs.([dynamics2 ] ) .",
    "these amplitudes have the form    @xmath76    where @xmath77 @xmath78 is the @xmath79 floquet state and @xmath80 is the corresponding floquet parameter .",
    "as @xmath81 is periodic , it can be expanded as a fourier series @xmath82    using the eqs ( [ floquet],[fourier ] ) in eq.([dynamics2 ] ) we obtain set of equations for the parameter @xmath80 and for the amplitudes @xmath83 @xmath84 replacing @xmath85 from eq .",
    "( [ amplitud2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ amplitud1 ] ) , the characteristic equation for @xmath80 is obtained @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "this equation has @xmath88 solutions for both @xmath89 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that the indetermination in @xmath80 introduced by the term @xmath90 is superfluous since the floquet evolution operator is evaluated at @xmath91 and therefore @xmath92 .",
    "once we have the values for @xmath80 we obtain the fourier coefficients @xmath93 and , using eq.([fourier ] ) , @xmath94 .",
    "+ the floquet matrix has the form @xmath95 and , therefore , @xmath96 where @xmath97 . interpreting @xmath73 as a rotation operation with angle @xmath98",
    ", its application to the initial state @xmath74 times , maximizes the probability to find the searched state .",
    "then for any @xmath8 one can build a discrete time algorithm to perform the search .",
    "we have developed a new insight in generating a continuous time quantum search algorithm using a characteristic of quantum mechanics , quantum resonances .",
    "this algorithm behaves like grover s algorithm ; in particular the optimal search time is proportional to the square root of the size of the search set , @xmath0 , and the probability to find the searched state oscillates periodically in time .",
    "the efficiency of this algorithm depends on the spectral density of the hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "a bigger separation between the energy levels maximizes the probability of the searched state and allows for a better precision . for any hamiltonian with discrete energy spectrum , independently of its spectral density",
    ", this algorithm can be implemented taking a large enough search set .",
    "the algorithm was shown to be robust when the energy of the searched state has some imprecision .",
    "however the improvement in the accuracy of the search by increasing @xmath1 , and the error margin are bounded by the relation @xmath99 constant .",
    "this means that for a large @xmath1 it demands a good precision in the eigenvalue of the searched state . noting that @xmath62 is an energy variation , and @xmath0 is the time needed for the measurement , the previous relation is simply the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "+ we have found a simple way to build a discrete time algorithm on the basis of our continuous time search algorithm , which strongly suggests the equivalence between search algorithms with discrete and continuous time . + it has been recently shown that grover s algorithm may not be directly applicable to search in a physical database@xcite .",
    "indeed , it has also been pointed out that it would be neither technologically nor economically reasonable to build database search engines basen on grover s search algorithm@xcite .",
    "similar questions might be raised about the algorithms presented here .",
    "regarding the implementation of these algorithms , we note that the quantum kicked rotor has been experimentally realized using ultra - cold atom traps and some experiments have focused on the resonant case @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have recently shown that the discrete quantum random walk on the line has the same dynamics as the kicked rotor in resonance @xcite .",
    "several systems have been proposed as candidates to implement quantum random walks @xcite .",
    "when these devices are constructed , they may be employed to simulate the search algorithms proposed here .",
