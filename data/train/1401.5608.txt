    "although the @xmath1cdm remains being the simplest and the more efficient way to describe most of the astrophysical and cosmological data , many doubts concerning the nature of dark energy and dark matter still persist .",
    "the cold dark matter paradigm is a robust way to explain the large scale structure of the universe although its difficulties in explaining the cored density profile of galaxies and the small number of satellites around galaxies , the so called `` small scale problems '' .",
    "however , it is crucial to emphasize that these inconsistencies come from the results of numerical simulations which still do not take into account all the physics envolved in the structure formation process .",
    "moreover , the cosmological constant @xmath1 suffers from serious theoretical problems since its inferred value from the observations is around 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical value of the vacuum energy density predicted by particle physics .",
    "alternative cosmologies incorporate new physics to the standard context either by replacing pieces of the @xmath1cdm model or by adding new ingredients to it .",
    "the unified scenario adopts the former suggestion .",
    "its main idea is to replace the two unknown dark components , namely , dark matter and dark energy by one single fluid . as candidates for this scenario one can cite the gcg and the bulk viscous fluid which have both exotic equations of state . in some sense",
    ", the unification scenario can be seen as a modified dark matter dominated model , i.e. , dark matter has some unusual equation of state that drives the universe to a late accelerated phase .",
    "the formation of structures like galaxies and cluster depends on the dynamics of the baryonic matter which consists of no more than 5% of the energy budget of the universe . at the same time",
    ", baryons follow the dark matter potential wells .",
    "the main challenge for unified cosmologies relies on the fact that the fluid that clusters to form `` dark matter halos '' also has to accelerate the expansion .",
    "therefore , the clustering process of such models is a very sensitive probe for constructing viable cosmological scenarios .",
    "the models studied here will include baryons in the dynamics both at background and perturbative level .",
    "a famous candidate for the unified scenario is the chaplygin gas @xcite , but its generalized form ( the gcg ) is widely used .",
    "the pressure @xmath2 of the gcg is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants . fixing @xmath7 one has the original chaplygin gas @xcite .    in the limit @xmath0 it reduces to a scenario where dark matter has a negative constant pressure and",
    "the resulting dynamics is exactly the same as the @xmath1cdm model at background level as we will show below .",
    "however , it still not clear whether both models also display the same dynamics at perturbative level .    some works in the literature claim that the gcg gas with @xmath0 and the @xmath1cdm model are also indistinguishable at first and non - linear order @xcite .",
    "indeed , by choosing suitable first order variables there is a mathematical mapping between both models .",
    "however , a contrary opinion can be found in refs . @xcite where it is argued that the same definition for the matter density contrast used in the standard cosmology , which is also adopted by the galaxy surveys when obtaining the data , has to be adopted for alternative models like the gcg model .",
    "therefore , in this case the mathematical mapping no longer exist .    references @xcite first investigated the non - linear clustering of the original @xmath7 chaplygin gas .",
    "the extension to the generalized case was performed in @xcite .",
    "the recent work by fernandes _",
    "et al _ @xcite extended in more detail the analysis for the gcg model with different values of @xmath6 ( see also @xcite ) . in this contribution we will revisit the equivalence between @xmath1cdm and the gcg model with @xmath0 .",
    "we calibrate our numerical code in order to match the results of ref .",
    "@xcite but we also include in our analysis the @xmath1cdm case",
    ".    such essence of unifing dark energy and dark matter effects into a single fluid is also captured by other models .",
    "the possibility of a late time expansion driven by the viscous mechanism has been first adopted in @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the spherical collapse for this model . assuming the eckart approach for dissipative fluids @xcite , its equation of state is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10velocity of the fluid and @xmath11 is the coefficient of bulk viscosity .",
    "usually one adopts the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a constant and @xmath14 is the density of the bulk viscous fluid .",
    "the subscript @xmath15 denotes today s values .",
    "the constant parameter @xmath16 assumes in principle any real value .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that transport coefficients deduced in kinetic theory depend on positive powers of the temperature of the fluid @xcite .",
    "therefore , negative values for @xmath16 sounds unphysically from the thermodynamical point of view .    in the frw",
    "metric the bulk viscous pressure reduces to @xmath17 . due to the dependence of the pressure @xmath18 with the expansion @xmath19 , it is usually difficult to solve analitically for the density @xmath14 when fluids other than the viscous one , e.g. baryons , are present into the dynamics",
    ". therefore we will obtain in this work only numerical results for the viscous model even at the background level .",
    "we are interested in expansions of the type    @xmath20,\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the hubble constant today , @xmath22 is the today s density parameter for the baryonic matter and @xmath23 is the fractionary density parameter for the fluid that unifies the dark sector with @xmath24 being the critical density .    for the gcg we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "note that for @xmath0 the expansion reduces to    @xmath27\\ ] ]    and the @xmath1cdm model is recovered with the identifications @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "for an one - fluid approximation , i.e. , when one does not take into account other components into the dynamics , the evolution of the bulk viscous model and the gcg are exactly the same .",
    "the equivalence @xmath30 implies in the correspondence @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "of course , this is an unrealistic case .",
    "if , at least , the baryons are included , the viscous pressure will indirectly depend on @xmath33 since @xmath34 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath35 is therefore obtained from the numerical solution of @xmath36^{1/2}=0\\ ] ] where we have defined the dimensionless parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the initial condition @xmath38 will be fixed to the same value as @xmath39 .",
    "our goal here is to obtain the perturbed equations for the evolution of an overdense spherical region collapsing in an expanding universe .",
    "we follow refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us first define basic quantities .",
    "for the collapsed region one can write @xmath40    the velocity of the collapsed region @xmath41 can be seen as the balance between the background expansion and the peculiar motion .    the effective expansion rate of the collapsed region is written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 the peculiar velocity field .    for the collapssing region",
    "one has to assure energy conservation .",

    "the dynamics of the perturbed region will be governed by the raychaudhuri equation @xmath49    for the sake of comparison we write down below separately the system of equations for the gcg , the @xmath1cdm and the bulk viscous model .      the equations for the spherical collapse of the gcg have been deduced in details in @xcite . for the system baryons plus",
    "gcg they read    @xmath50    @xmath51\\frac{\\theta}{a},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath52\\ .\\ ] ]    these equations use the definitions @xmath53 @xmath54 which have been defined in @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath1cdm model both the baryonic and the dark matter component are pressureless fluids .",
    "@xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    note that baryons and dark matter obey to similar equations .",
    "this exemplifies the known fact that baryonic matter tracks the dark matter potential wells after the decoupling .",
    "a crucial aspect for the develoment of this work is that the system ( [ blambda])-([thetalambda ] ) can not be recovered by setting @xmath0 into the gcg system ( [ bgcg])-([csgcg ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the bulk viscosity into the unified models described by the above set of equations .",
    "in general this is done by adding the bulk viscous pressure term @xmath18 to the standard kinetic pressure @xmath58 .",
    "however , for our viscous fluid we will use the approximation @xmath59 so that the pressure of the unified viscous fluid is dominated by the nonadiabatic contribution @xmath18 .",
    "this is equivalent to    @xmath60    therefore , the speed of sound is properly modified following @xmath61\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 is viscous equation of state parameter .",
    "note that @xmath63 depends on the potential of the perturbed velocity field which is a very particular feature of the bulk viscous model .",
    "therefore taking into account the introduction of the viscous pressure the dynamical equations for @xmath64 and @xmath65 are properly modified    @xmath66    @xmath67\\frac{\\theta}{a},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath68\\ .\\ ] ]",
    "we extend now the results of ref .",
    "@xcite which did not compare the spherical collapse for the gcg with @xmath0 with the dark matter component of the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "this analysis is very important because many studies in the literature argue that both models are identical also at perturbative level . indeed , as discussed in @xcite the supposed equivalence between these models , known as `` dark degeneracy '' , should also be observed at first order perturbative stage .",
    "they have shown however that this degeneracy survives at linear regime if the same initial conditions for @xmath69 and @xmath65 are assumed .",
    "we wonder if a dark matter dominated model in which its equation of state is a negative and constant pressure is exactly the same as the @xmath1cdm , then why it does not become the standard cosmological model ?    in fact ,",
    "if dark matter only leads to the same universe as the @xmath1cdm model , this would represent the final solution of the dark energy paradigm .",
    "of course , the answer is not so simple and indeed there exist a difference between the models as we will show below .",
    "the study of the non - linear clustering can break the degeneracy .",
    "if we trace the behavior of the dark matter perturbations it is possible to show that this component behaves differently in both models .",
    "following @xcite we solve numerically the system of equations ( [ bgcg ] ) - ( [ thetagcg ] ) with initial conditions @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for the background we fix @xmath73 , @xmath39 and @xmath74 .",
    "besides , our analysis for the gcg always uses @xmath75 .    a proper comparison of the gcg s results with the @xmath1cdm model occurs if we set @xmath76=0.7125 and @xmath77 with the same values for @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "then , this assures that the background evolution for the case @xmath0 and the @xmath1cdm is exactly the same .",
    "1 shows the density perturbation growth of the dark component for both models .",
    "we plot the results for the gcg gas ( @xmath78 ) with values @xmath0 ( dashed black ) and @xmath79 ( solid black ) .",
    "our results match the results of @xcite and we have confirmed the consistence of our numerical code for all other values of @xmath6 .",
    "the dark matter density contrast @xmath80 of a flat @xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath81 is plotted in the solid red line of this same figure .",
    "as one can see , the behavior of the `` dark '' component in each model is indeed different and consequently , although very similar , the models are not the same .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a full analysis of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "to quote amendola _",
    "et al _ , `` we note how the @xmath1cdm curve and @xmath0 are very close , but not identical because of the different perturbation sectors . ''",
    "@xcite .",
    "the agreement would exist if we had adopted for the gcg a different definition of the density contrast @xmath82 rather than the one defined in ( [ deltadef ] ) .",
    "however , the products of galaxy surveys are observables like the growth index , @xmath83 and the matter power spectrum which adopt the definition ( [ deltadef ] ) .",
