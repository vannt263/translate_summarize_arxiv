    "the pulsar has an eccentric ( _ e _ @xmath2 0.28 ) orbit around its companion and the orbital period of the binary system is @xmath28.3753 days ( int zand et al . 1998 ) .    the orbital profile of 4u 1907 + 09 exhibits two flares per orbit separated by @xmath3 orbital phase ; a large primary at the periastron and the small secondary at the apastron ( marshall & ricketts 1980 , int zand et al .",
    "the presence of the two phase - locked flares had led to the suggestion that the compact object passes through a circumstellar disk of matter around the equatorial plane of a b__e _ _ type stellar companion ( iye 1986 , cook & page 1987 ) .",
    "however the position of 4u 1907 + 09 in the corbet diagram ( corbet 1984 ) indicates that the companion is probably an ob type supergiant .",
    "latest optical ( cox et al . 2005 ) and infrared ( nespoli et al . 2008 ) observations actually showed that the companion could be classifed as an o8 - o9 ia supergiant with a mass loss rate of @xmath4 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 , and a lower limit of distance @xmath25 kpc .",

    "; the absence of dips matches with the orbital phases when n@xmath10 reaches to its maximum value just after the periastron passage ( see lower panel of figure [ dipper ] ) .",
    "moreover , the possibility of dipping is less in orbital phases from 0.8 to 1.1 when compared to phases from 0.1 to 0.6 ; which is in anti - correlation with the n@xmath10 values .",
    "the source frequently undergoes in dipping state during the times with minimum n@xmath10 and the possibility peaks between the phases 0.4 - 0.5 .",
    "it is important to note that this is not a strong conclusion , since direct measurement of the spectral parameters of the dips is not possible for us .",
    "recently , strongly structured wind of the optical companion is accused of being the reason of the dips in hmxb light curves .",
    "the clumpy wind of the companion , being highly inhomogeneous , creates regions of different density .",
    "recent models have shown that the density of the wind material can change up to several orders of magnitude ( runacres & owocki 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , a sudden decrease of x - ray luminosity is caused by the decrease in mass accretion rate .",
    "as the accretion rate decreases the alfvn radius increases and accretion stops when the source enters to propeller regime .",
    "hence , the disappearance of pulsations can be explained by the passage of the pulsar through low density regions of the wind .",
    "the limit to the luminosity that turn on the propeller mechanism can be derived from the condition where the magnetospheric radius is equal to the co - rotation radius ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) and it is @xmath56 erg s@xmath6 for the case of 4u 1907 + 09 .",
    "therefore , the dipping states are candidate episodes for propeller regime since the count rates are below detection threshold .",
    "similar propeller transition is suggested as the cause of observed dips in the accretion powered pulsars gx 1 + 4 and gro j1744 - 28 ( cui 1997 ) .",
    "the dipping episodes of 4u 1907 + 09 are known to have irregular time coverage , with varying duration .",
    "we investigate the distribution of dipping states through the orbital phase .",
    "about 46 of the 98 observations include dipping states .",
    "the percentage of exposure time spend in dipping is @xmath228% of the total exposure . in order to obtain the orbital distribution of dipping states",
    ", we calculate the percentage of the dip exposure to total exposure corresponding to each orbital phase with 0.1 phase resolution .",
    "the variation of the dip exposure percentage on orbital phase is plotted together with folded asm light curve at orbital period at figure [ dipper ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the occurrence of dips sharply decreases during the periastron passage and after the passage . around the periastron passage , asm count rate and therefore x - ray flux increases , whereas number of dip states decreases .",
    "it should be kept in our mind that a transient qpo had been found during one of the flares which suggests the formation of a transient disc ( int zand et al .",
    "this implies that the number of occurrences of dip states is less at the periastron passage and afterwards since the disc accretion is dominant mechanism . after the apastron ( phases from 0.1 to 0.5 ) , number of dip states increases due to the clumpy nature of accretion and occurrence of",
    "transient propeller regime episodes increases .",
    "the latter naturally explains the variable nature of the spin down .",
    "the combination of disc and wind accretion at different phases of orbit may lead to random walk nature of pulse frequency time series .",
    "in this paper , we present analysis of _ integral _ ibis - isgri ( between 2005 october and 2007 november ) and _ rxte_-pca ( between 2007 june and 2011 march ) observations of the accretion powered pulsar 4u 1907 + 09 .",
    "using _ integral _ and _ rxte _ observations , we report new pulse period measurements and obtain an updated version of the pulse period history of inam et al .",
    "( 2009a ) which is shown in figure [ history ] . using these measurements ,",
    "we construct power spectrum density of the pulse frequencies ( see figure [ power ] ) .",
    "we find that fluctuations in the pulse frequency derivatives are white noise and the pulse frequency fluctuations are consistent with the random walk model .",
    "the noise strength is found to be @xmath57 hz s@xmath1 .",
    "we infer that in short time scales , there may be transient disc formation around the neutron star which causes random walk in the pulse frequency while in the long term the spin down rate is steady .    from the x - ray spectral analysis of _",
    "rxte_-pca observations , we find that only hydrogen column density ( n@xmath10 ) is significantly variable over the binary orbit , tending to increase just after the periastron passage ( see figure [ spe ] )",
    ". this might indicate that the location of the absorbing material is the dense stellar wind of the companion star .",
    "we also study flux dependence of spectral parameters and find that power law index show correlation with the 3 - 25 kev unabsorbed x - ray flux indicating spectral hardening with decreasing x - ray flux ( see figure [ flux_index ] ) .",
    "this spectral variation might be related to mass accretion rate variations and/or inhomogeneities in the companion s wind .",
    "we also look for the irregularities of pulsations near dipping ingress and egress ( see figure [ varpulse ] ) .",
    "we propose that the disappearance of pulsations can be explained by the passage of the pulsar through low density regions of the clumpy wind which may lead to a turn - on of a temporary propeller state so that the x - ray luminosity decreases below the detection threshold .",
    "we are able to analyse orbital dependence of the dip state occurrences ( see figure [ dipper ] ) .",
    "we find that the source more likely undergoes in dipping state after the apastron until the periastron where transitions to temporary propeller state might occur due to accretion from clumpy wind .",
