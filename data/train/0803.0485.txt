    "progress in research fields as laser cooling , production and controlling sub femtosecond laser pulses , manufacturing of solid state devices , and so forth , render experiments of novel quantum characters . a key model in quantum optics is the harmonically trapped ion pumped by external lasers @xcite , which successfully has been used to study pure quantum phenomena in experiments @xcite .",
    "both the internal electronic structure of the ion and its center - of - mass motion are treated quantum mechanically and it is possible to tune experimental parameters such that a single or few electronic transitions in the ion can be isolated and coherently coupled to the motion . the spatial profile of the driving laser , either a standing wave ( sw ) or a traveling wave ( tw ) , effectively reshape the trapping potentials",
    ". in particular , a unitary transformation of the regular one - dimensional ion hamiltonian with tw pumping may result in two equally shifted and displaced coupled harmonic oscillators @xcite , whereas sw fields in general generate coupled potentials with a more complex shape .",
    "in addition , a fairly new proposal , verified by experiments , is to place the trap inside a high-@xmath0 micro cavity such that it is the cavity field driving the trapped ion @xcite .",
    "even bose - einstein condensates have been successfully trapped and coherently coupled to a single cavity mode @xcite .    in most theoretical work , pertaining to both of the sw and tw cases ,",
    "approximations are imposed in order to obtain analytical or semi - analytical results valid in different parameter regimes :    1 .   _ the lamb - dicke _ ( ld )",
    "_ regime_. in this regime the wavelength of the classical laser field is long compared to the extent of the confining harmonic trap and an expansion in the small _ lamb - dicke parameter _",
    "@xmath1 of the mode profile function is made @xcite .",
    "2 .   _ the rotating wave approximation _ ( rwa ) _",
    "regime_. here , a basis is defined in which the involved time scales differ considerably and , once in the interaction picture , fast oscillating terms are neglected @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the particular system can be separated into a `` slow '' and a `` fast '' part , which puts constraints on the constituent frequencies ; trap frequency @xmath2 , ion transition frequency @xmath3 , laser frequency @xmath4 and rabi frequency @xmath5 ( laser - ion coupling amplitude ) .",
    "_ strong and weak excitation regimes_. these are the limiting situations of either a very large or small dimensionless parameter @xmath6 @xcite corresponding to , respectively , strong or weak pumping of the ion .",
    "it should be noted that this definition assumes a moderate number of phonon excitations , othervice the effective rabi frequency may become relatively large even in the weak excitation regime .",
    "this in fact , is the case of the current work",
    ".    typically , the parameter regimes for which the above approximations are justified overlap and , in particular , there are regions in which none of them is valid . in many studies ,",
    "one of the approximations is applied and one considers dynamics `` beyond '' the others .",
    "this , however , can be misleading since one is often in a parameter regime where also the non - imposed approximations could in principle have been implemented .",
    "recently , liu et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the ground state of a tw pumped trapped ion may be considerably lowered when both the rwa and the ld approximation are invalid . in the current work we use a fully numerical method and therefore",
    "no approximations are imposed .",
    "we discuss , nevertheless , the various parameter regimes as well as introduce an additional approximation , namely , the _ adiabatic approximation _ , to provide further insight into the quantum dynamics .",
    "it is commonly thought that the dynamics , in contrast to the simple cases of the validity regimes discussed above , becomes irregular beyond these approximations .",
    "we will here show that this is indeed not always true .",
    "theoretical and experimental research on trapped ions has been concerned with both sw and tw driving , with the main focus on the latter .",
    "examples include state preparation of non - classical vibrational states such as schrdinger cat states or fock states for both tw @xcite and sw @xcite pumping , collapse - revivals in the tw @xcite and sw @xcite cases , state measurement @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned theoretical works almost exclusively employed the formalism of vibrational creation and annihilation operators for the harmonic trap .",
    "we , on the other hand , will reformulate the model in terms of ionic center - of - mass position and momentum , casting the problem into one of two coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "in particular , we will study the coupled dynamics of an ion wave packet evolving on the two potentials in the case of sw pumping .",
    "for a one - dimensional system , as the one we consider , it resembles an idealized diatomic molecule for which only two coupled bound electronic states are taken into account .",
    "a similar analogy , but between a diatomic molecule and a cavity qed model , was pointed out in @xcite , works that also made use of the wave packet method .",
    "as the standard viewpoints and methods applied in quantum optics and molecular physics are rather different , we discuss them and their relation in some depth with the aim to facilitate branching out and combining the two research fields .    since the pioneering work in the seventies by heller @xcite ,",
    "wave packet techniques have been used especially in molecular and chemical physics research @xcite .",
    "it is not always possible to separate the dynamics in isolated electronic states and the evolution on coupled electronic potentials has to be considered ; couplings could be of e.g. vibronic , spin - orbit , or rotational nature or induced by an external laser field . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we display two schematic examples of coupled potentials , bound - bound in ( a ) and bound - repulsive in ( b ) .",
    "solid potential curves are diabatic , while the corresponding adiabatic ones are dashed ( for a proper definition , see sec . [ ssec2b ] ) . when the wave packet propagates on the coupled potentials , interference effects will occur . in the bound - repulsive system ,",
    "one such effect manifests itself as unexpectedly long - lived vibrational states @xcite .",
    "this takes place when the interference restricts the wave packet evolution in such a way that the repulsive part of the system at the right side of the curve crossing is not reached , indicated with the heavy solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1].b .",
    "we call this a _ bistable _",
    "motion @xcite .",
    "similar interference effects can also occur in a system consisting of two coupled bound states , in which case the wave packet always returns to the same diabatic potential after one oscillation ( see fig  [ fig1].a ) . in _",
    "astable _ motion ( not shown ) , the wave packet starts in one diabatic state , splits at the curve crossing and when it returns to the curve crossing it recombines in such a way that it switches completely to the other diabatic state . consequently",
    ", astable motion can not exist in a system comprising coupled bound - repulsive states .",
    "we have previously carried out a numerical wave packet study of the dynamics of bistable trajectories @xcite and found that the trajectories can be exceedingly long - lived with sharp fractional and full revivals",

    "we point out that also in such a system bistable motion exists and investigate the short- and long - term evolution of the system under this interference condition .    the outline of the article is as follows .",
    "we begin sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] by presenting the trapped ion model hamiltonian , as it is generally stated in quantum optics , and discuss parameter regimes and the corresponding approximations  rotating wave , lamb - dicke , weak and strong excitation and adiabatic .",
    "it is shown how the hamiltonian relaxes to an effective one mimicking the acclaimed jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the relation between frequently used bases are considered in sec .",
    "[ ssec2b ] for which we define the corresponding potential curves .",
    "this enables us to obtain a deeper intuition about the dynamics and physical properties of the coupled system .",
    "the analogous molecular electronic states with their potential energy curves and couplings are also discussed , briefly . the following sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] is dedicated to our numerical results .",
    "first we define the concept of bistable motion and then show how it enters into the trapped ion model . for short timescales ,",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ ssec3a ] that this type of dynamics oscillates between an entangled ( can be made maximally entangled ) and a disentangled state .",
    "we analyze the nature of the wave packet evolution around the potential curve crossing in terms of the ionic inversion , the autocorrelation and the von neumann entropy .",
    "for very long times ( sec .",
    "[ ssec3b ] ) we observe distinct wave packet collapse , fractional and full revival structures .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] gives a short summary .",
    "this section introduces the model trapped - ion hamiltonian . the problem is first formulated in terms of operator algebra , commonly used in the quantum optics community , and then recast in the conjugate variable representation frequently applied in , for instance , molecular physics . within the latter representation",
    ", the obtained hamiltonian resembles that of an artificial diatomic molecule with two coupled bound electronic states .",
    "there are several parameters determining the particular form of the potential curves and coupling , namely , effective ion - laser coupling @xmath5 ( rabi frequency ) , trap frequency @xmath2 , laser frequency @xmath4 , ion transition frequency @xmath3 , ld parameter ( laser wavelength ) @xmath1 , and laser phase shift @xmath7 . for a large ld parameter ,",
    "the curves exhibit several crossings , whereas for small @xmath1 one may encounter only a few , one or even no crossings in the parameter range of interest . we will here be interested exclusively in the situation of a single level crossing of the two potential curves .      in the formalism of phonon creation @xmath8 and annihilation @xmath9 operators",
    "the hamiltonian reads ( we use atomic units so that @xmath10 ) @xmath11\\hat{\\sigma}_x,\\ ] ] with the ion - laser detuning @xmath12 and the @xmath13-operators act on the two ionic levels @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the ld parameter is defined in terms of the ionic mass @xmath18 and laser wave number @xmath19 as @xmath20 , and the relative position of the trap in the standing wave laser field is determined by @xmath7 .    in order to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution we discuss the approximations regularly applied in trapped ion models .",
    "these often result in analytically solvable effective hamiltonians . in the ld regime ,",
    "@xmath21 , we may expand the cosine function to obtain @xmath22 \\hat{\\sigma}_x+\\mathcal{o}(\\eta^2).\\ ] ] in this regime , the effect of the phase shift @xmath7 is clear .",
    "for @xmath23 , where @xmath19 is an integer , the ionic vibrational states are not coupled by the external laser ( _ carrier pumping _ ) , whereas if @xmath24 the vibrational states do couple ( _ sideband pumping _ ) @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamexp ] ) coincides with the rabi model @xcite . neglecting the virtual processes ( i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to simultaneous deexcitation / excitation of the field and the ion ) one derives the regular jc hamiltonian in the rwa @xmath27 where in this case @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the jc model is analytically solvable and the eigenvalues of its corresponding hamiltonian are known as ( up to an overall constant ) @xmath31    as pointed out , the effective rwa hamiltonian , in principle , is only justified for @xmath32 , whereas in general situations more sophisticated rwa approaches must be considered . turning to an interaction picture with respect to the free field and ion ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hamexp ] ) becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "this introduces three different time scales of the interaction , suggesting an application of the rwa .",
    "it is known , however , that the validity of the rwa does not solely depend on the involved time scales , but also on the relative amplitudes of the coupling parameters @xcite . in particular , only for ion - field couplings much smaller than the ion level separation and vibrational spacing  @xmath35 and @xmath36 ,  is the rwa justified .",
    "we then note : firstly , the lamb - dicke regime seems to favor application of the rwa , which , in fact , we have verified by numerical calculation .",
    "secondly , the angle @xmath7 is of importance for the validity of the rwa and together with the three characteristic time scales it becomes clear that a straight - forward application of the rwa in the basis presented above is non - trivial .",
    "the first observation will be of importance further on when we introduce the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the second is indeed an interesting issue that was resolved by wu and yang @xcite .",
    "their idea is that also the third term of the expanded hamiltonian ( [ hamexp ] ) is considered as a `` free '' part , and these first three terms define the interaction picture and the proper time scales . within this frame ,",
    "the slowly oscillating terms describe a jc type of interaction between the field ( vibrations ) and `` dressed '' atomic states @xcite differing from the @xmath14 and @xmath15 states .",
    "yet another , but related , approach is to use the expansion @xcite @xmath37}\\ ! & = \\ ! & \\displaystyle{\\mathrm{e}^{-\\eta^2/2}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\epsilon_k \\frac{(-\\eta)^k}{k!}\\cos\\left(\\phi+k\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)}\\\\ \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\left[\\hat{a}^kf_k(\\hat{n}+k)\\!+\\!f_k(\\hat{n}+k)(\\hat{a}^\\dagger)^k\\right]\\ ! , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 otherwise and @xmath44 are the generalized laguerre polynomials . imposing suitable resonance conditions ( @xmath45 , for @xmath46 ) between the constituting frequencies , we may for proper amplitudes of the couplings employ a rwa to regain a jc like interaction in terms of `` deformed '' oscillator operators @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath49 define generalized boson operators obeying modified boson algebras and they specify , for instance , non - linear fock and coherent states being eigenstates of @xmath50 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "note that , in some sense , the new ladder operators can be viewed as describing a non - linear oscillator with amplitude - dependent frequency .",
    "additionally , it is known that the anharmonicity of an oscillator greatly affects physical phenomena like collapse and revivals @xcite .",
    "related algebraic techniques , in particular shape invariance and susy , can therefore be a useful tool for describing molecular dynamics where oscillators are in general anharmonic @xcite .",
    "we remark , however , that most of these models @xcite employ the standard rwa as it is used in the jc model , while it is clear that this is in general less justified than for the jc model , due to varying distance between energy eigenvalues , for instance .",
    "we pointed out above that the relative size between the effective laser - ion coupling @xmath5 and the two - level spacing @xmath3 is crucial for the validity of the rwa .",
    "also the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath2 is important . in general , for moderate phonon numbers ( @xmath51 ) , the strong - excitation regime @xcite , @xmath52 , invalidates the rwa and the ld approximations , while the opposite weak - excitation regime @xcite favors them .",
    "it should be emphasized , though , that , eventually , the applicability of the approximations depends on all parameters , including @xmath3 and @xmath1 , and their mutual relations .",
    "now , rather than by the boson creation and annihilation operators as above , we represent the hamiltonian in terms of conjugate variables @xmath53 obeying the regular canonical commutator relation . in this nomenclature",
    "we find @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the external laser wave number and @xmath18 the mass of the ion .",
    "this representation of the hamiltonian serves as the starting point of our analysis ; for a given initial state , its wave packet will evolve on two coupled harmonic oscillators according to eq .",
    "( [ ham3 ] ) .",
    "we note that in @xmath55-representation a _ fock state _ of the vibrations , @xmath56 , or a _ coherent state _ , @xmath57 , read @xmath58 ^ 2 } \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{m\\omega(x-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m\\omega}}\\alpha)^2}{2}}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] here , @xmath59 is the @xmath60:th hermite polynomial .      to gain a deeper intuition of the problem it is in order to discuss various bases that will be used in the following .",
    "one natural representation is that of _ bare basis states _ , which are the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian part @xmath61 , where @xmath60 represents the @xmath60:th fock eigenstate of the harmonic oscillator . in @xmath55-representation",
    "the bare basis states are written as @xmath62,\\langle x |n,2\\rangle = \\varphi_n(x)\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0 \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\bigg\\}$ ] . + a general _ bare state _ is given by @xmath63 or @xmath64 for some normalized wave function @xmath65 . from the form on which the hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) is presented , it is clear that the external laser field enters in the off - diagonal terms and hence couples these states .",
    "the bare states can be used to define _ bare potential curves _ as the diagonal potential elements of the hamiltonian in the ionic basis @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the bare potentials are two centered oscillators shifted in energy with either @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian are called _ dressed basis states _ and denoted by @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we have introduced the superscript @xmath70 since , for a wide range of parameters , the eigenstates come in pairs , which is true in particular when the rwa or the ld approximation or both have been imposed , as seen in ( [ jceig ] ) for the jc model . in these regimes , not necessarily only for the jc model , `` simple '' analytic solutions to the problem are available , whereas in the general case this is not true .",
    "note that there is no obvious corresponding set of dressed potential curves .",
    "the above two bases are part of the the conventional terminology of quantum optics .",
    "we now turn to a more convenient representation of coupled molecular electronic states . for this purpose",

    "the form of @xmath74 has many similarities with the hamiltonian describing a diatomic molecule in a diabatic representation .",
    "the off - diagonal elements in ( [ ham4 ] ) are in potential form , i.e. , they do not contain differential operators . here ,",
    "the couplings are @xmath75-independent , which however is also frequently assumed in models used in molecular physics , e.g. , the landau - zener model @xcite .",
    "note that in our ion - trap system @xmath75 represents the spatial center - of - mass position of the ion in the trap , whereas in the molecular counterpart @xmath75 is the internuclear distance .",
    "the operator @xmath76 transforms the bare internal ionic states as @xmath77},\\\\ \\\\",
    "\\displaystyle{|+\\rangle = u_1|2\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right ] , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] which defines the _ diabatic states _ as @xmath78 , and the corresponding _ diabatic potential curves _ as the diagonal potential matrix terms of ( [ ham4 ] ) .",
    "thus , contrary to the bare curves , these are centered oscillators modified by @xmath79 and depending on the parameter amplitudes very different types of diabatic potentials may be obtained .",
    "for example , if the oscillating cosine function dominates over the harmonic oscillator ( in the spatial range of interest ) , the system is semi - periodic and is best understood from bloch or floquet theory @xcite . in the opposite limit of a small @xmath5 and @xmath19",
    "we may expand the cosine as in ( [ hamexp ] ) to find the two centered oscillators both shifted and displaced according to the added terms @xmath80 $ ] . in this paper , we are interested in a regime intermediate between the two .    given the hamiltonian in the form of ( [ ham3 ] ) , the transformation @xmath81\\ ] ] with @xmath82 diagonalizes the last term of the hamiltonian .",

    ", while @xmath83 acting on the bare states gives the _ adiabatic states _ ; @xmath88 , for @xmath89 .",
    "note that @xmath90 is in general @xmath55-dependent .",
    "the diagonal and non - diagonal terms containing @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the non - adiabatic corrections , and if these play a minor role in the wave packet evolution , the dynamics is said to be adiabatic .",
    "for the present system , we have @xmath93}{\\left(\\delta^2 + 4\\lambda^2c^2\\right)^2 } } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and typically the second , higher derivative term , is smaller . for",
    "diatomic molecules an equivalent transformation from the diabatic to an adiabatic representation can be applied .",
    "consequently , also then non - adiabatic couplings are both @xmath75- and @xmath84-dependent .",
    "we remind , as discussed in the previous section , that the rwa and ld approximations are highly related in terms of validity ranges and especially @xmath21 ( or likewise for small @xmath19 ) is a constraint on their implementation . here , as well , we note that for small @xmath19 the non - adiabatic coupling terms ( [ noad ] ) become small . on top , we claimed that @xmath96 is also a condition for the applicability of the rwa and the ld approximation , which from ( [ noad ] ) again is seen to favor the adiabaticity .",
    "we have verified by numerical calculation that all three approximations more or less share the same parameter validity range . from ( [ noad ] )",
    "one notes that also the case when @xmath97 gives vanishing non - adiabatic corrections .",
    "this limit , however , does not represent a proper adiabatic one , but rather the diabatic limit , and is hence sometimes referred to as the anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "since we consider parameters where the adiabatic approximation breaks down , it follows that we can apply neither the rwa nor the ld approximation .    in table",
    "i , we summarize the various bases , while in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show some typical examples of the corresponding potentials .",
    "note that at the crossing point , when the cosine function is zero , the bare and adiabatic potentials coincide , while away from the crossing the diabatic and adiabatic curves approach each other for the current set of parameters .",
    "we may point out that different definitions of the above bases exist , and in particular in quantum optics is the bare - diabatic and the dressed - adiabatic representations often identical .",
    "identifying bare states as diabatic ones and dressed states with adiabatic ones does not , however , properly coinside with the common definitions in molecular and chemical physics .",
    "adiabatic states are in general not eigenstates of the full hamiltonian , as dressed states are , and diabatic states usually approximate the adiabatic ones far from curve crossing regions , which is not the case of bare states .",

    "the state can be written as @xmath154 for 50 - 50 splitting , and well separated splitted wave packets , we have that the vibrational wave functions of the bare states @xmath14 and @xmath15 are orthogonal , in agreement with the maximal entanglement . at this instant , the combined bi - partit ion - phonon system is in an @xmath155 schrdinger cat state . to a first approximation , we may assume the wave packets to keep their shape over a time period of one classical oscillation .",
    "that is , for initial coherent states , the splitted states are still coherent with modulated phase and amplitude .",
    "this is indeed verified below , where we considers the dynamics in phase space .",
    "thus , the phonon distrubutions in this case are poisonians for the diabatic states , while for the bare states they would be made out of the sum of two coherent states with equal phase but different amplitude .    calculating the variance of the wave packets ,",
    "one notes that the squeezed state @xcite , @xmath149 , shows typical breathing motion while traversing the potential back and forth . from the decrease in amplitudes ,",
    "the quantities corresponding to the coherent state is seen to be more sensitive than for the squeezed state , or in other words , the collapse time is faster .",
    "this fast dephasing comes about due to the larger spread in phonon numbers @xmath60 for the coherent initial state .",
    "it also shows up as rapid oscillations in the inversion around the curve crossings .",
    "the plots also give a measure of the characteristic transition time at the level crossing @xcite , and one notes that this time is rather short compared to the full time @xmath105 , which is indeed known from other similar models @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we have found that short crossing time as well as the sharp peaks with large amplitudes in the inversions , ( a ) and ( d ) , around the crossings are typical for the bistable cases .",
    "the bare state inversion can be expressed in terms of the diabatic wave packets as @xmath156 $ ] , and is hence related to the coherence of diabatic wave packets .",
    "we note that the total energy can be written as @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the two diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ ham4 ] ) .",
    "from this it is seen that the bare state inversion is a measure of the diabatic energy transfer .    at first",
    ", it may seem surprising that the inversion @xmath143 can be non - zero at the right side of the crossing , even if the autocorrelation @xmath160 is close to 1 and the entropy @xmath161 is close to zero .",
    "the zero entropy , however , is not a contradiction as the field and ion states can be separated , provided the constituent wave packets fractions @xmath162 and @xmath163 differ merely by a complex constant . for the inversion we have @xmath164\\\\ \\\\ & \\leq & 2\\sqrt{\\left[1-\\langle\\psi_-(t)|\\psi_-(t)\\rangle\\right]\\langle\\psi_-(t )    \\end{array}\\ ] ] while for the autocorrelation @xmath165 for sufficiently small @xmath166 it follows that @xmath160 can be close to one even if @xmath143 is not exactly zero .    , autocorrelation @xmath160 and entropy @xmath161 for a coherent ( a)-(c ) and a squeezed ( d)-(f ) initial state .",
    "see text for the parameters.,width=264 ]    the wave packet splitting manifests itself also in the phase space distributions @xcite . in fig .",

    "we show the wigner distribution after the collapse at approximately @xmath168 for a squeezed state .",
    "the spreading of the distribution over the whole accessible phase - space is a character of the collapse . at times of fractional revivals , the wave packet forms multiple localized bumps @xcite .",
    "the two constitute parts of @xmath169 approximately follow the `` classical '' phase space trajectories @xmath170 with the adiabatic and diabatic hamiltonians @xmath171 and @xmath172 . the small anharmonicity of the potentials is reflected in the pattern of the wigner distribution .",
    "the squeezed distributions rotate along the trajectories , which gives rise to the characteristic breathing motion of its width .",
    "the phase space plots suggest that the two involved wave packets roughly evolve on either of the potential curves @xmath173 or @xmath174 , and at the right side away from the crossing point these two approximately coincide .",
    "we argued that the corresponding classical times must be equal , @xmath175 , in order for the wave packets to overlap at the curve crossing and interfere maximally .",
    "this , however , does not imply that the longer time scales , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , of the potentials are equal , as will be discussed next .",
    "we now turn to the dynamics over time scales of the order of @xmath137 , which for our parameters correspond to several thousands of classical oscillations .",
    "since we are in the strong - excitation regime , this does not , however , necessarily imply exceedingly long total operational times .",
    "the expansion of the eigenvalues ( [ eigexp ] ) , in general , contains an infinite number of terms , but for relatively smooth potentials one expects fairly fast convergence .",
    "higher order terms typically cause imperfect full time and fractional revivals , by which we mean that the amplitude of , say , the autocorrelation function squared does not reach the values @xmath179 , where @xmath180 , as expected @xcite for rational fractions of the revival time @xmath181 , @xmath19 and @xmath182 mutually prime .",
    "this effect , arising from higher order anharmonicities , is naturally more pronounced for longer times , and hence the revival amplitudes drop for each consecutive revival period @xmath137 .",
    "the widths of the revival peaks are getting broader , as well . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the uncertainty in phonon numbers @xmath60 affects the collapse - revival pattern .",
    "in particular , the envelope functions of the revival peaks are highly sensitive to the uncertainty @xmath183 , while the location of the peaks are determined by the average @xmath119 . in the `` ideal '' case ,",
    "full amplitude revivals occur at @xmath184 for integer",
    "@xmath182 , half amplitude revivals at @xmath185 , and so forth . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we present the autocorrelation function ( a ) and von neumann entropy ( b ) for a time span slightly longer than @xmath137 .",
    "the parameters and initial conditions are similar to the ones of figs .",
    "[ fig3].(d)-(f ) ; @xmath186 rad , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the slight change in parameters gives 40 - 60 splitting ( @xmath190 ) rather than 50 - 50 .",
    "some of the numerous fractional revivals are labeled conventionally @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig5].(b ) , we note that in the collapse region the field and ion are highly entangled , but the fact that @xmath190 causes a decrease of entanglement compared to the @xmath191 case .",
    "we have previously @xcite studied the bistable motion and long - term revivals in system hamiltonians with more resemblance to molecular models . in terms of the classical period , the revival time found in the present study",
    "is much longer than those we calculated for the molecular systems .",
    "this originates in a smaller anharmonicity of the ion - trap system . in @xcite",
    ", we found that in accordance with expectations from a semiclassical derivation the revival time of the coupled system @xmath137 can be obtained from the revival times of the adiabatic @xmath192 and diabatic @xmath193 pathways and the wave packet splitting as @xmath194 this relation was fulfilled for numerous systems , comprising both coupled bound - bound and bound - repulsive states .",
    "equation  ( [ asarev ] ) accurately reproduces the limiting cases of adiabatic @xmath116 and the diabatic @xmath115 evolution .",
    "if @xmath195 , then we presumably have that the size of @xmath137 is between the values of @xmath192 and @xmath193 in the intermediate range .",
    "however , in reality @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath111 are not independent variables as they all depend on the system parameters in a complex manner .",
    "to conclude , the revival time for multi - level systems can be shorter than those of individual isolated systems . for the classical periods , on the other hand , we found that @xmath196 for bistable trajectories .",
    "thus , the dynamics can not be viewed as two uncoupled wave packets evolving on the potential curves @xmath174 and @xmath173 .",
    "only interference between these two wave packets can cause a common revival time @xmath137 shorter than one of @xmath192 or @xmath193 .",
    "in this article we have studied in a non - standard way the dynamics of a harmonically trapped ion pumped by a standing wave beyond the rwa and the ld approximation . using a wave packet technique",
    ", we predict the existence of bistable states of motion similar to those observed for molecular systems @xcite .",
    "these arise from interference of wave packets and hence it is a pure quantum effect . over longer time periods",
    "these states possess a well resolved collapse - revival pattern including full and fractional revivals .    beyond the conjecture of the new class of bistable ion - trap states",
    ", the article establishes a link between trapped ion systems and molecular physics models . as such ,",
    "we have put extra stress on how the two areas relate to one another ; expressing the model hamiltonian in @xmath55-representation and introducing diabatic and adiabatic states and potential curves .",
    "we intend to further investigate these directions , both by considering algebraic methods in simple molecular models and by extending the current ion - trap system to include additional ionic internal levels and vibrational degrees of freedom",
    ". we will also allow for different trapping potentials in order to more closely mimic molecular - like situations .",
