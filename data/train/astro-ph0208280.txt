    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are end - products of binary evolution . in the galactic disk , they are the fossil markers of rare primordial binaries in which neutron stars ( nss ) are retained after birth in systems with low mass companions , from which accretion and a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) phase transfers angular momentum to spin them up to msec periods .",
    "the `` standard model '' of msps as the remnants of lmxbs ( reviewed by bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) is supported by the discovery of the msec x - ray pulsar xte  j1808@xmath9369 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) as well as the accumulating evidence for msec pulsation periods in a number of lmxbs from apparently stable frequencies in their quasi - periodic oscillation power spectra .",
    "however formation and evolution questions remain since no lmxb in quiescence ( qlmxb ) has yet been found as a radio msp , and the reduction in angular momentum transfer efficiency imposed by likely advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf)-type accretion in quiescence means that the msps predominantly arise from a population of bright lmxb transients ( yi & grindlay 1998 ) which may not be observed in numbers sufficient to support the disk msp population .",
    "the recent radio detection of 20 msps in the globular cluster 47  tuc ( ngc  104 ) by camilo et al .",

    "2001a ; hereafter fcl01 ) , have opened a new window for the study of the nature and formation / evolution of msps .    in globular clusters ,",
    "in which msps are expected to show the same factor of 100200 excess in their numbers ( per unit stellar mass ) as do the lmxbs compared with the disk population ( clark 1975 ) , the msps trace more exotic binary evolution ( and possibly stellar evolution ) paths than in the field . here",
    "the msp progenitor binaries can be formed readily from main sequence binaries by the exchange of a ns into the binary ( e.g. rasio , pfahl , & rappaport 2000 ) or they may also ( in very high density cluster cores ) form from direct 2-body tidal capture ( mardling 1995 ) or 3-body encounters . clusters also allow the exchange of the original mass donor with a replacement main sequence ( or near turnoff , given mass segregation ) star , for which the msp discovered in ngc  6397 ( damico et al .  2001a ; damico",
    "2001b ; hereafter dpm01 ; ferraro et al .  2001 ) and detected with chandra ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001b ; hereafter ghe01b ) might be the first example .",
    "the 15 msps with precise locations ( fcl01 ) include 47  tuc - g and -i separated by just @xmath10 . the sample is now extended to 16 with the timing position for 47  tuc - s ( freire 2001 ) , which places it just @xmath11 from 47  tuc - f .",
    "we have identified ( ghe01a ) probable x - ray emission from the original 15 msps ( -g and -i can not be resolved , and -c is a marginal identification at best , as described below ) , and we report here the possible detection of 47  tuc - s . in this paper , we provide the details for the chandra detections of this complete ( for radio detection ) sample of msps and derive the x - ray properties of this first significant sample of msps detected in a single globular .",
    "we derive the x - ray luminosities , spindown energy loss @xmath12 , and the characteristic age ( @xmath13 ) for these msps , using the 47  tuc distance , 4.5@xmath14 kpc , derived from the recent compilation of zoccali et al .",
    "this is the first derivation of these properties for a significant sample of msps at a common known distance .",
    "we also compare the 47  tuc msp results to those of the single msp detected in ngc  6397 ( ghe01b ) and previous ( rosat ) results for msps in the field and one other globular ( m28 ) , as summarized in the review by becker & trmper ( 1999 ; hereafter bt99 ) .",
    "a 74ksec chandra observation ( 72ksec total data obtained ) was conducted on 2000 march 1617 , in which at least 108 sources were detected in the @xmath15 around the cluster center ( ghe01a ) . with the acis - i detector used ,",
    "the @xmath16 pixel size and @xmath11 ( fwhm ) telescope - detector point spread function ( psf ) for sources within 4of on - axis combine to give source positions with 1@xmath17 centroid uncertainties of @xmath18 for sources detected with 90% confidence ( jerius et al .",
    "even a source identified with just 1 count ( cf .",
    "discussion below of msp 47  tuc - c ) is thus located with @xmath19 ( 1@xmath17 ) centroiding error .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute positions of chandra sources are dominated by aspect ( guide star ) offsets ( i.e. boresight offsets between the x - ray and optical axes ) and are currently estimated to be @xmath20 ( aldcroft et al . 2000 ) .    given these relative and absolute errors for source positions , the initial run of the ciao tool ( dobrzycki et al .",

    "identified an elongated source between the positions of 47  tuc - f and 47  tuc - s , which can be best explained as the combined emission of the two sources .",
    "we estimate the counts for -f and -s by noting that the x - ray position is twice as close to -f as -s , and thus assign -f two - thirds of the counts .",

    "we use 3 bands rather than the hardness ratio xcolor = 2.5log(cts[0.51.5kev]/cts[1.56.0kev ] ) used in ghe01a since it allows an approximate spectral analysis for the msps . with ( limited ) counts in 3 bands ,",

    "for a dipole field , both thermal ( isotropic ) polar caps are likely visible and the effective radius of each would be 0.14 km , or 0.56 km for h - atmosphere models .",

    "the small emission area implies x - ray pulsations ( which can not be measured given the 3.2sec acis - i integration time ) with a sinusoidal pulse shape appropriate to the fractional visibility of the isotropically radiating thermal polar cap(s ) .",
    "in contrast , the narrower pulse duty cycles of 10% for some field msps ( and one in the globular cluster m28 ; cf .",
    "bt99 ) are probably due to non - thermal beamed emission .",
    "if the x - ray emission were a ( pure ) tb spectrum with kt 1kev , the required emission measure em 4 10@xmath34@xmath35 would suggest plasma densities n 3 10@xmath36r@xmath37@xmath35 for an emission region ( assumed spherical ) of radius r. such a region must not dominate the observed dispersion measure of the msp , which is typically dm = 24.4 @xmath35pc for the 47  tuc msps with a variation @xmath38 dm 0.1@xmath35pc that is likely due to the ionized ism in 47  tuc ( freire et al .",
    "thus , the msp local contribution to dm is probably n @xmath39 r 0.03 @xmath35pc 1 10@xmath40 @xmath26 .",
    "combined with the constraint above for em , for a constant density emission region this implies an unrealistically large lower bound for the emission region : r .",
    "( for a tb source with radius r 10@xmath41 cm , or comparable to the size of the typical msp binary separation , n 3 10@xmath42 -3 is required which would strongly violate the dm constraint . )",
    "thus a pure tb spectrum is ruled out .",
    "similarly , with the exception of 47  tuc - j , pl models are unlikely since their photon index must be implausibly large ( 3 ) and are still inconsistent with the colors for most of the sample .",
    "the limited statistics can not , of course , rule out combined bb + pl models , but certainly it appears that the msp sample in 47  tuc is dominated by thermal emission from polar caps of the nss .",
    "the 47  tuc msps are the first significant sample of msps at known distance with measured x - ray and radio properties .",
    "several long - standing pulsar questions can be addressed .",
    "foremost is the correlation of x - ray luminosity and pulsar spindown luminosity @xmath12 , which is found for field msps ( with much more uncertain distances ) to scale as 10@xmath43 ( bt99 ) . here",
    "the globular cluster is both a hindrance and an interesting laboratory : the msps are accelerated in the cluster potential , thus biasing the observed values of and hence ( @xmath44 ) . fcl01",
    "have modeled the variations of among the 15 msps with precise locations ( not including 47  tuc - s ) to derive constraints on both the cluster potential and the intrinsic @xmath45 values for the msps .",
    "tighter constraints on @xmath45 can be obtained by assuming the cluster gas ( detected from variations in dm ) is uniform so that the observed dm value and projected radius give the 3d position in the cluster for each msp ( see freire et al .",
    "2001b ) . assuming a king model for the cluster , and using the central velocity dispersion = 11.6kms@xmath2 ( meylan & mayor 1986 ) , then gives the cluster acceleration term ( cf .",

    "results are given in table  [ tab : results ] and plotted vs. in figure  [ fig : lxedot ] .",
    "uncertainties in the derived values are typically 0.20.5 in the log ( though several are larger ) but are not shown for clarity ; uncertainties in log(l@xmath23 ) are typically 0.2 ( see table 1 ) . for comparison with all msps previously detected in x - rays , we also plot values for 10 field msps and one each in the globular clusters m28 and ngc  6397 .",
    "the data for the field msps and m28 ( from which values are derived ) are summarized in the new compilation of data and distances in table 2 whereas the ngc  6397 x - ray results are from ghe01b and are discussed in detail in  4 below .",
    "we have repeated this analysis for variations in both cluster distance ( 5.0kpc ; + 1.5@xmath17 ) and central velocity dispersion ( 13.0kms@xmath2 ; + 1@xmath17 ) to sample the range of cluster acceleration models , and thus intrinsic @xmath45 values .",
    "our goal is to derive the approximate index @xmath5 in the relation @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "whereas the field msps ( and pulsars generally ) are roughly consistent with the linear relation 10@xmath43 ( bt99 ) , the msps in 47  tuc appear to have a much weaker dependence : log= ( @xmath50)log+ @xmath51 for the nominal cluster model with = 11.6kms@xmath2 , where the errors ( @xmath61@xmath17 ) are due to just the scatter in the points . including the errors on each point , but with the approximation that unequal errors ( on @xmath12 ) are simply averaged ( which biases the slope to steeper values , since the unequal errors are much larger for smaller values of @xmath12 ) , increases the slope to @xmath52 and offset to @xmath53 .",
    "the best estimate of the slope is thus @xmath5 @xmath54 .",
    "allowing for the error in the cluster model by using the + 1@xmath17 value for the central velocity dispersion , = 13.0kms@xmath2 , and again including the errors on each point gives slope @xmath55 and intercept @xmath56 , and so is consistent .",
    "similar variations in @xmath5 and the intercept are found for the increased ( by about 1.5@xmath17 ) cluster distance , 5kpc .",
    "thus , the msps in 47  tuc have ( 0.52.5kev ) values within a factor of 4 ( apart from 47  tuc - c ) despite a range of 25 in @xmath12 . for comparison , the field ( and m28 )",
    "msps in figure  [ fig : lxedot ] have @xmath5 = 1.13@xmath60.15 and offset @xmath57 and so have @xmath5 consistent with both the rosat band ( 0.12.4kev ) results of bt99 and the 210kev results derived by possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who find @xmath5 = 1.37@xmath60.10 .",
    "it is tempting to speculate these different @xmath5 values may be due to the different formation histories and possibly different physical parameters of msps in the field and 47  tuc . in figure",
    "[ fig : lxage]a we plot vs. spindown ages , @xmath58 = @xmath59 , for field and 47  tuc msps .",
    "error bars on the age parameter are not shown , for clarity , but are typically @xmath60 in the log and primarily due to the cluster acceleration model . despite the uncertainties ,",
    "the correlation is striking : the field msps show a declining with `` age , '' and the 47  tuc msps appear to fall on this trend but with a flatter vs. age slope .",
    "( although both age and @xmath12 are derived from combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath45 , they are algebraically different so that the same flatter correlations with are not inevitable . ) in  5 we compare the /@xmath58 relation ( fig .",
    "4b ) with the models of hm02 , finding both qualitative similarities ( noted by hm02 ) but also important differences .",
    "we note that although spindown ages correspond only approximately to actual ages , the derived values are consistent with the formation of most 47  tuc msps in a  burst \" early in the cluster history .",
    "however this by itself would not provide an explanation for the different correlations observed for in 47  tuc and field msps .",
    "as a measure of the systematic uncertainties in age , the 0.6gyr value derived from the cooling age for the he - wd companion of 47  tuc - u ( edmonds et al .  2001 ) may be compared to the 0.9gyr or 2gyr spindown age of the msp ( two solutions for @xmath45 are possible for 47  tuc - u , as is also the case for -g and -m from the total sample of 15 for which the cluster acceleration model yields values for @xmath45 and thus and @xmath58 ) .",
    "another possible physical difference between the 47  tuc and field msps might be magnetic field strength at the ns surface and thus also the light cylinder ( at which the corotation speed equals @xmath62 ) , since this likely affects the relative importance of non - thermal ( magnetospheric ) emission .",
    "for an assumed dipole field , this is given by @xmath63 g , with @xmath64 in units of 10@xmath65 s s@xmath2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lxblc]a we plot for the same pulsars vs. @xmath66 . as before ,",
    "considered as a homogeneous group , the field pulsars ( and m28 ) lie on a significantly steeper logarithmic slope ( 1.70@xmath67 ) than the 47  tuc msps ( 0.66@xmath68 ) .",

    ", the surface field would be sensitive to multipole components which could give the larger scatter in figure  [ fig : lxblc]b .",
    "we return in  5 to additional arguments for a modified surface field topology .",
    "we note that 3 out of the 4 msps in the field with @xmath74 g display x - ray emission that is seemingly magnetospheric , with the nature of emission from the 4th ( the eclipsing msp b1957 + 20 ) indeterminate ( bt99 ; takahashi et al .",
    "conversely , field pulsars with @xmath75 g have x - ray emission that is typically either thermal or of indeterminate character ( bt99 ) .",
    "considering the small numbers of such pulsars studied , and that most of them have highly uncertain distances ( see table  [ tab : mspdata ] ) , it is possible that field pulsars with @xmath76 g may show an l@xmath23@xmath66 trend that is fairly flat and roughly consistent with the better determined relation for the 47  tuc msps .",
    "however for this interpretation to hold , a few field msps with well determined distances ( e.g. j0437@xmath94715 and j1744@xmath91134 ; cf .",
    "table  [ tab : mspdata ] ) must be accounted for and the even larger deviations of j0751 + 1807 and j1024@xmath90719 from the 47  tuc correlation line would require a factor 3 adjustments in these msp distances . the fact that 5 of the 7 field msps with log(@xmath12 ) 34 have values above the trend - line for the 47  tuc msps may suggest these field msps still have non - thermal emission components .",
    "we return ( in   5 and 6 ) to further discussion of the possibility that the magnetic field configuration and evolution for old cluster nss may differ from those in the field .",
    "fcl01 pointed out the puzzling fact that the radial distribution of the ( then ) 15 msps with timing positions seemed to be truncated within 3.5@xmath77 , where = @xmath78 is the core radius of the visible stars in the cluster as determined most recently ( and completely ) by howell , guhathakurta , & gilliland ( 2000 ) .",
    "the addition of 47  tuc - s , as the 16th msp with a precise location ( freire 2001 ) , does not change this .",
    "it is therefore of particular interest to compare the radial distribution of the 16 msps with the chandra source distribution over a region large enough to measure the radial profile of the sources most likely to be msps .",
    "our @xmath15 central field study ( ghe01a ) suggested most of the msps are soft and a possible total msp population of 50 in this region alone .",
    "here we extend the study of the chandra sources out to a radius of 4(10@xmath77 ) , to search for possible cutoffs or truncations in any of the chandra source distributions as might be expected if the msp distribution were cut off .",
    "we compare the msp radial profiles with those of chandra sources in several apparent spectral ( hardness ) classes to further test the possible identification of faint soft sources ( `` red background sources '' ) with the large msp population suspected ( camilo et al .",

    "we are undertaking a study based on the latter method .",
    "the ks probabilities ( table  [ tab : ks ] ) and king model fits ( table  [ tab : king ] ) show that the radial distribution of the 44 soft sources is indistinguishable from that of the msps , and indeed 7 of the 9 sources identified with msps with well - measured xcolor values are soft .",
    "these soft msps include the doubles ( -g , -i ) and ( -f , -s ) , for which separate xcolors could not be determined , so that in fact 9 msps are accounted for .",
    "the remaining msps are either faint ( -m , -t ; softcts 5 ; cf .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] ) or crowded ( -l , -q ) , but it can nevertheless be seen from the x - ray colors plotted in figure  [ fig : cc ] that all 47  tuc msps , with the exception of 47  tuc - j , are probably soft ( although 47  tuc - u , with xcolor = 0.9 , is formally in the medium group , while colors for 47  tuc - c could not be measured ) .",
    "motivated by these results we have searched the list of soft sources for extra msp candidates . of the 37 soft sources",
    "not identified as msps , two are likely qlmxbs ( x5 and x7 ; ghe01a and heinke et al .  2002 ) , two are cvs ( v3 and ako 9 ; ghe01a ) and three are sources with counts more than two times brighter than the brightest detected msp .",
    "only 17 of the remaining 30 sources fall in the hst field of view ( fov ) of albrow et al .",
    "nine of these 17 sources are astrometrically matched to optical variables ( hereafter  active binary \" candidates ) identified with hst ( edmonds et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and an additional 2 are faint blue stars and possible cvs , one of which is also a periodic variable .",
    "seven of the optical variables have independently been identified as likely by dras , red stragglers , or contact / semi - detached binaries by albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and 2 of them were reported by ghe01a as by dras based on the additional ( more restrictive ) constraint of significant x - ray variability .    despite the lack of detection of any of the 7 soft msps as optical variables , it is possible that several of the active binary candidates contain msps .",
    "for example the optical companion to the one msp known in ngc  6397 was previously identified as a by dra candidate by taylor et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter tge01 ) .",
    "the corresponding chandra source is relatively hard ( see   4 ) and would not have been included in our list of soft sources in 47  tuc , but we can not be sure that all other msps with main sequence ( or red straggler , as likely for the ngc  6397 msp ) companions will be similarly hard .",
    "in fact , after the initial submission of this paper , the relatively hard chandra source w29 ( ghe01b ) has been identified with the msp 47  tuc - w as having a main sequence companion ( edmonds et al .",
    "2002 ; cf .   4 ) . also , one or both of the soft sources with a faint blue optical counterpart could be a he wd companion to an msp ( like 47  tuc - u ; edmonds et al .",
    "2001 ) , instead of a cv .",
    "the definitive msp characteristic is , of course , a pulsed radio source .",
    "however , a significantly larger sample of msps with radio timing positions , for comparison with the optical variables , will be difficult to obtain because so much observing time has been devoted to finding the 16 already known .",
    "therefore , to estimate the number of msps implied by our soft sample we consider two extreme cases : ( a ) none of the candidate optical counterparts ( 9 active binary and 2 cv candidates ) are msps , or ( b ) all of the candidate optical counterparts are msps .",
    "for case ( a ) we find that only 6 of the soft sources falling in the hst fov ( and with counts @xmath117 the brightest detected msp ) do not have a known i d . correcting for the detected fraction of msps with timing positions that are soft sources ( 7/16 ) and the incomplete fov of hst ( 17/44 sources are outside the hst field ) we estimate an extra population of 19 ( @xmath118\\times16/7 $ ] ) msps with @xmath119 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath2 , in addition to the 16 already known . for case ( b ) a total population of 69 ( @xmath120 ) extra msps",
    "is implied , for a total maximum msp population of 85 .",
    "these estimates are based on scaling from the number of soft source detections with to the total msp population with timing positions . using a different technique we estimate the number of soft sources missed by by examining the net counts _",
    "not _ attributable to sources within a radius of 24(=1for the background stars ) , where crowding will most limit faint source and crowded - field detection , and the annulus 12surrounding the cluster center . by removing counts from the original image in 1radius regions around each source ( from ghe01a ) in both the softcts and mediumcts bands ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] ) , and then subtracting a fraction of the remaining counts ( in each band ) to correct for the psf - spillover from these bright(er ) sources due to the energy - dependent chandra telescope psf , we find 180@xmath656 softcts , 20@xmath658 mediumcts and 15@xmath636 hardcts in the central 1radius region , and 60@xmath624 , 75@xmath628 and 45@xmath625 , respectively , in the surrounding 12annulus .",
    "thus , as suspected in ghe01a , there is an excess of softcts in the cluster core , but the uncertainties in this extraction are large and no excess in the core of mediumcts or hardcts is required . for the detected msps with softcts as listed in table  [ tab : results ] ( with mean value 6cts ) , the excess total softcts ( 240 ) could arise from an additional 40 msps , all with 10@xmath1 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "since some of these soft sources could be by dras ( coronal sources are typically soft ) or cvs , as already noted ( ghe01a ) , we regard 40 as an upper limit and estimate 20 ( half ) `` unresolved '' msps in the core .",
    "scaling by our known sample of 16 msps , we derive @xmath121 msps as an upper limit on the total msps in the cluster .",
    "this upper limit agrees with the upper limit derived from consideration of soft sources , and we adopt 90 as an approximate maximum number of msps in 47  tuc with 10@xmath1 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "both of these estimates assume that no beaming of the msps in x - rays is occurring .",
    "( note that thermal polar cap emission , while pulsed , is not beamed . )",
    "if there are more msps than this in 47  tuc , they must have relatively hard spectra ( since the above totals are scaled from the soft source counts ) which could make them like the msp in ngc 6397 ( see below ) for which radio emission is occulted much of the time . alternatively",
    ", additional msps are beamed away from us in the x - ray , or of significantly lower x - ray luminosity on average .",
    "the softer color of the excess counts than our known msp sample suggests that either the excess counts are composed largely of other sources ( such as faint by dra binaries ) , or that there is a significant population of faint ( in x - ray and radio ) msps which would have cooler ( and thus softer ) polar caps .",
    "a significant number of additional ( 1570 ) msps already detected in the chandra data but not yet detected in the deep parkes radio surveys is quite possible , given the relatively flat dependence of soft x - ray luminosity , l@xmath23 , on effective radio luminosity , l@xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the flux density at 1400mhz and @xmath124 the msp distance .",
    "this relation is shown in figure  [ fig : lxlr ] for 47  tuc , ngc  6397 , m28 and field msps .",
    "the 47  tuc msps have a distinctly flatter l@xmath23 dependence on l@xmath125 , with logarithmic slope 0.00@xmath60.23 for all the 47  tuc msps or 0.25@xmath60.15 with 47  tuc - c excluded from the fit , as shown in figure  [ fig : lxlr ] .",
    "the logarithmic slope is 0.99@xmath60.17 for the field msps ( and m28 ) , which is at least partly affected by sample selection bias .",
    "thus it appears that in 47  tuc msps that are fainter at radio wavelengths are not as much fainter in x - rays and should be more readily detected in chandra data than in parkes data .",
    "the ratio of 47  tuc msps likely detected in x - rays ( 3590 ) vs. radio ( 20 ) can constrain the relative beaming fractions since both samples are detected above the same x - ray luminosity limit (= 10@xmath1 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath2 ) . if the x - rays are not beamed , the implied radio beaming fraction is 0.20.5 .",
    "we can not ( yet ) isolate the candidate msps among the unresolved component , but as a possible aid to future msp identifications , we report the positions and fluxes of the 19 soft sources detected which are not identified with possible by dra or cv candidates . in table",
    "[ tab : cands ] we give the source positions , detected counts , and approximate luminosities ( again , assuming for consistency a kt = 0.2kev bb spectrum in the 0.52.5kev band ) .",
    "these are all possible msp candidates ( though some by dras and a few cvs are likely included ) and thus appropriate for use as trial positions in timing solutions for detected radio msps .",
    "we now compare the properties of the 47  tuc msps with those derived for the single msp in ngc  6397 .",
    "this msp , psr  j1740@xmath95340 ( damico et al .",
    "2001a ) , hereafter 6397-a , was recently located by a pulse timing solution ( dpm01 ) and identified with an optical counterpart ( ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ) previously identified with a main sequence binary or by dra system ( tge01 ) .",
    "chandra observations of ngc  6397 ( ghe01b ) detected 20 sources within 1of the cluster center , including the msp .",
    "because the chandra sources included 8 cvs firmly identified with hst optical counterparts displaying emission ( ghe01b ) , the chandra - hst boresight could be measured to @xmath126 in ra and dec .",
    "thus the astrometric identification of the chandra source u12 ( ghe01b ) with the apparent by dra binary wf4 - 1 found by tge01 is secure ( the chandra - hst positional offsets are given in table  [ tab : results ] , and the chandra - radio offsets are given in ghe01b ) . since this binary has an optical photometric period 1.34d ( tge01 ) which is consistent with that of 6397-a ( damico et al .",
    "2001a ) , and is included in the 1astrometric uncertainty of the hst guide star vs. radio timing reference frames , it was identified as the probable optical counterpart by ferraro et al .",
    "in addition to the precise chandra positional identification of the 1.34d binary , we confirm the msp identification by its x - ray temporal variability which was mentioned by ghe01b as being consistent with modulation at the binary period . in figure  [ fig:6397 ]",
    "we show the x - ray light curve of 6397-a ( source u12 ) plotted against the binary phase as determined from the ephemeris of dpm01 .",
    "the count rate increases smoothly by a factor of 2 at phase 0.4 , or just before the msp comes out of radio eclipse ( which is centered at phase 0.25 ; phase 0 is the time of ascending node ) , removing any doubt that the msp is the x - ray counterpart . the fact that the flux is not zero during eclipse ( though chandra coverage only begins at phase 0.1 ) suggests that the x - ray source is extended and larger than the companion size , which has radius 1.31.8@xmath127  and nearly fills its roche lobe ( burderi et al .",
    "thus the x - ray emission is likely to be from the relativistic wind from the msp interacting with the mass loss from the companion .",
    "any thermal ( bb ) component from the msp itself must be 0.5 the total flux , as constrained by the flux increase out of eclipse .",
    "the hardness ratios during ( hr1=4.7@xmath128 , hr2=0.42@xmath129 ) and outside eclipse ( hr1=3@xmath130 , hr2=0.57@xmath131 ) remain the same within the errors , implying the modulation is not due to increased @xmath24 .",
    "more sensitivity and phase coverage is needed to confirm and constrain the modulation .",
    "the x - ray counts detected in each of the soft , medium and hard bands are given in table  [ tab : results ] , together with the value from dpm01 , which assumes that , given its relatively large projected offset of @xmath132 ( 11@xmath77 ) from the cluster center , the cluster acceleration may be ignored .",
    "msp 6397-a is clearly very hard , with hardness ratios hr1 = 3.6 and hr2 = 0.5 .",
    "we do not plot it in figure  [ fig : cc ] since the very different absorption column ( @xmath24 = 1.0 10@xmath133 @xmath26 , or 4  that for 47  tuc ) precludes direct comparison with the models plotted for 47  tuc , but it is consistent with a pl with photon index 1.5 or tb with kt 5 kev .",
    "however we can compare the derived and characteristic age , and their relation to l@xmath23 , for this msp with the 47  tuc sample . in figures  [ fig : lxedot ] and [ fig : lxage ] we plot 6397-a but do not include it with the linear fits which were derived for the 47  tuc msps alone .",
    "it is clear that 6397-a is consistent with the 47  tuc sample and correlations shown in both figures .",
    "including it on the vs. correlation would give a combined ( 47  tuc and ngc  6397 ) @xmath3 @xmath4 relation with @xmath134 , even including the errors on all the points ( despite the bias towards steepening the slope in doing so , as mentioned before ) .",
    "this is at first surprising , given the very different spectral shape and thus emission region , as well as ( much ) smaller spindown age , @xmath135 , for 6397-a .",
    "however the eclipsing msp in 47  tuc with the hardest spectrum , 47  tuc - j , already hints that the x - ray spectral shape is not critical to the vs. correlation , since -j does not depart from the correlation line .",
    "thus there seems to be a relatively fixed ( 0.52.5kev ) for both the 47  tuc msps and 6397-a which emerges for a given spindown power regardless of the emission mechanism .",
    "it appears that the conversion of into thermal ( bb ) emission from the ns and emission probably tied to the relativistic pulsar wind are both fixed by the total polar cap current which , from the models of hm02 is in turn proportional to @xmath32 ( see  5 ) .    finally , we note that the large radial offset of 6397-a in the cluster , at radius 11@xmath77 , is much larger than any of the detected , or plausible new candidate , msps in 47  tuc .",
    "dpm01 and ghe01b noted it was likely ejected from the core , perhaps in a second exchange encounter since the msp companion is not the expected he wd or low mass ( ablated ? ) remnant of a secondary in an lmxb ( as for all previously identified msp companions ) but rather is apparently just off the main sequence .",
    "ghe01b noted that 6397-a is approximately aligned with the central `` line '' of blue stragglers as well as several other of the chandra sources  suggesting possible asymmetric ejection of binaries from the cluster core ( possibly induced by cluster rotation ; r. spurzem , private communication ) .",
    "since ngc  6397 is a post core collapse cluster with a power law cusp measured out to 60(lugger , cohn and grindlay 1995 ) that is expected to contain scattered binaries ( and nss ) , the msp has surely been scattered .",
    "burderi et al . (",
    "2002 ) show that 6397-a could have evolved from an initial 14h binary period to its present 34h period , near the critical value where pressure from the msp wind exceeds that of matter overflowing the roche lobe ( though intermittent accretion could resume ; cf .  5 ) .",
    "however the scattering encounter probably occurred within the past 10@xmath136 yr since the central relaxation time is only 10@xmath137 yr ( harris 1996 ) and still 10@xmath138 yr at the current offset position .",
    "an upper limit to the scattering time is 10@xmath139y , the likely time since core collapse and also the likely msp `` age '' ( figure 4a ) .",
    "the scattering timescale is thus shorter than the binary or nuclear evolution timescales leading to the present system , and the interaction must have altered the binary parameters .",
    "most probably , the binary hardened in the encounter if the present secondary was the original donor .",
    "this makes it less likely that the secondary , now just inside its roche lobe , could have filled its roche lobe prior to the encounter and spun the msp up in an lmxb phase .",
    "if mass transfer occurred only after the hardening induced by the encounter , there would not be enough time to spin up the msp given the 10@xmath140 @xmath110  yr@xmath2 for the likely intermittent lmxb phases ( burderi et al .",
    "2002 ) and the msp `` age '' .",
    "if , however , the current secondary was exchanged into the binary displacing what was the original donor ( probably a much lower mass hewd , as in most other msps ) , there would not be the msp formation - timescale problem .",
    "even more interesting , this may help explain a puzzle pointed out by orosz & van kerkwijk ( 2002 ) after this paper was submitted : the measured ( dpm01 ) for 6397-a would suggest significant photometric heating of the binary companion ( by the msp wind ) though no visible heating modulation ( only ellipsoidal variation ) is observed .",
    "the `` excess '' might be a factor of 23 , depending on uncertain heat transport in the secondary .",
    "orosz & van kerkwijk suggest the large may be due to a value dominated by a triple companion ( easily tested by longer term msp timing ) . if , instead , the present secondary has been exchanged for the original , and it is marginally roche lobe filling ( burderi et al .",
    "2002 ) , then accretion ( and lmxb ) episodes could lead to spin_down _ episodes of the msp  at least for those encounters that are retrograde but possibly also for the very misaligned prograde case . depending on uncertain crust - core coupling timescales , an increased ( negative ; or positive for the nearly aligned prograde case ) may persist for the msp between intermittent accretion episodes .",
    "this enhanced in an  old \" msp with low b field would not produce the same enhanced pulsar wind ( and thus heating ) as a nominal  young \" ( higher b field ) msp since is now dominated by internal , rather than electromagnetic , rotation loss .",
    "the true age of 6397-a would thus be correspondingly older .",
    "of course reduction of would move 6397-a off the apparent correlation lines ( e.g. figs . 3 , 4a ) defined by the 47  tuc msps , though if ( only ) a factor of 23 reduction in this might be compensated if only the thermal component of ( not yet isolated ) were plotted .",
    "a second example of a possible  double - exchange \" msp , with a probable main sequence secondary , has been discovered with the optical identification of the msp 47  tuc - w : edmonds et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report ( after this paper was submitted ) the identification of chandra source w29 ( cf .",
    "ghe01a ) with a v=22.3 star in the central core ( 0.2r@xmath141 from the center ) of 47  tuc with optical modulation identical in both period ( to within 0.5s ) and phase ( to within 1.2min ) with the 3.2h binary modulation of 47  tuc - w .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and hardness ratios for the chandra source ( w29 ) are very similar to those for 6397-a .",
    "although this is a certain msp identification , its one - time ( 4h ) radio detection ( camilo et al . 2000 ) precludes measurement of its and thus value ( possibly enhanced ? ) so that it can not be included ( now ) in our analysis of the full radio msp sample in 47  tuc .",
    "its identification does show , however , that our estimates for the total msp sample in 47  tuc as derived from the soft source distribution are likely to be lower limits .",
    "indeed , edmonds et al .",

    "one of the key results of this study is that msps in the globular clusters 47  tuc and ngc  6397 may have a less efficient conversion of rotational spindown energy ( @xmath12 ) into soft x - rays ( l@xmath23 ) than most field msps , even those with correspondingly low values of their magnetic field at the light cylinder . for @xmath3 @xmath4 , the 47  tuc ",

    "however , several key differences are evident : ( i ) the 47  tuc msps ( and 6397-a ) show an unbroken power law dependence on age , with @xmath160 ( fig .",

    "9b ) at @xmath58 10@xmath156 yr , ( ii ) the /relation ( fig .",
    "4b ) likewise continues to increase beyond the expected flattening at similar @xmath161yr ( hm02 , fig .",
    "in contrast , the field msps in figures 4a , b are more consistent with the hm02 models , having negative or flat slopes , respectively , at @xmath58 10@xmath156yr . however , the factor of 310excess of /over those for the 47  tuc msps and the ics models also suggests these systems have an additional source of : probably non - thermal emission .",
    "it is interesting that accounting in figure 4b for the approximate dependence on pulsar period , /@xmath162",
    "( derived from a fit to fig .",
    "8b of hm02 ) , makes the field msps have a ( slightly ) more negative slope ( @xmath163 vs. @xmath164 ) , as expected from hm02 for their age , whereas the 47  tuc msps have a slightly more positive logarithmic slope ( 0.59@xmath60.10 vs. 0.53@xmath60.13 ) .",
    "finally , ( iii ) the small effective bb emission areas ( r@xmath165 0.140.56 km for dipole polar caps ; smaller still ( each ) for multipole caps ) are significantly smaller than the effective radius of the annular polar cap emission region predicted ( hm02 fig .",
    "we suggest that these differences may point to altered surface magnetic field configurations for the 47  tuc ( and 6397-a ) msps to enable such efficient pc heating at large age .",
    "if their surface magnetic fields have significant multipole components , the effective b - field curvature is greater and the pair production front moves closer to the ns yielding more efficient positron return to heat the polar caps .",
    "the magnetic field footprint on the ns becomes smaller , giving the small emission areas .",
    "if the non - thermal radio emission is produced , as in most models , from near the light cylinder where the field is dominated by the dipole component , then its properties are not significantly altered and the radio pulse profiles are otherwise similar to field msps ( as observed ; camilo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "clearly this multipole field hypothesis must be tested with models ( only dipole fields have been considered for pulsar emission and pc heating  e.g. hm02 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the nss in the 47  tuc msps ( and 6397-a ) are systematically more massive or compact than those in the field msps .",
    "the models of harding , muslimov , & zhang ( 2002 ) show that the ics regime becomes longer lived ( extends to lower values ) for more massive or more compact nss .",
    "although our radial distribution results (  3.2 ) imply msp masses ( total ) in the range 1.11.4 @xmath110  , suggesting the more compact ns interpretation may be preferred , more massive nss are allowed if in fact the msp distribution is `` puffed up '' by binary scattering .",
    "the hard spectra in a few of these `` thermal '' msps ( 47  tuc - j and 6397-a ) must have a different origin . in 6397-a",
    ", the possible modulation phased with the radio eclipse of the hard source suggests the hard source is due to shocked gas lifted from the binary companion by the msp wind pressure ( burderi et al .",
    "if the hard spectrum is a power law ( thermal bremsstrahlung is ruled out by the @xmath38 dm constraint [  2.1 ] unless the emission is strongly aspherical ) , and the shocked wind density and thus emission measure is proportional to the underlying msp thermal luminosity , then the approximate agreement of these hard spectrum , but low l@xmath23 , systems with the @xmath5 = 0.5 law exhibited by the soft ( thermal ) msps would imply scaling of the shocked gas emission with the thermal ( ns ) emission . as mentioned above , this might be expected if both the msp wind and pc heating are proportional to the pc current .",
    "what is special about globular cluster msps to drive them towards altered @xmath71 ( and thus @xmath66 ) values or configurations or possibly larger ns mass ( or compactness ) ?",
    "unlike msps in the field , those in dense cluster cores have a possibility of being driven back into contact and an accretion phase , as a re - cycled lmxb ( from a msp ) !   renewed accretion ( and the 6397-a companion is presently close to filling its roche lobe ; cf .",
    "dpm01 ) would likely continue the b - field burial process thought to be responsible ( e.g.  romani 1990 ) for field decay from the @xmath166 g fields at ns birth to the @xmath167 g values typical of msps .",
    "this could lead , in turn , to altered b - field configuration ( multipole field components ) , particularly for a secondary re - exchanged into an msp ( with random spin - orbital encounter angular momentum ) .",
    "it would also systematically increase the ns mass beyond that for field msps .",
    "the 47  tuc msps have spent their lifetime @xmath168gyr in a dense ( @xmath169 ) cluster core , where they undergo scattering interactions with both single stars and other binaries .",
    "such scattering causes the binding energy @xmath170 of a hard binary to secularly increase ( `` hard binaries harden '' ) at a rate @xmath171 ( goodman & hut 1993 ) , where @xmath172 is the single star mass , @xmath17 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , and @xmath173 is the impact parameter for a 90  deflection ( @xmath174au in the core of 47  tuc ) .",
    "thus , the binding energy of a typical hard binary increases by of order @xmath175 per core relaxation time ( @xmath176yr for 47  tuc ) . over the @xmath177gyr lifetime of the msp binary system ,",
    "the total relative binding energy change is @xmath178 .",
    "thus , while angular momentum transfer to the secondary acts to detach the binary , scattering events tend to drive it back toward contact .",
    "a complication in this picture is that since msps are extremely hard binaries ( @xmath179 ) , @xmath170 is adiabatically invariant in weak scattering events where the distance of closest approach much exceeds the binary separation ( e.g.  heggie & hut 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the secular increase in @xmath170 is largely the result of infrequent strong scattering events , which are likely to result in an ejection of the binary from the cluster core ( e.g. 6397-a ) or even the cluster .",
    "other unresolved issues include the effects of binary - binary scattering , which probably `` bump '' the msps back into contact more effectively than does binary - single scattering , and orbital eccentricity evolution during scattering events , which will also tend to drive some binaries towards contact .",
    "nevertheless , it appears plausible that a typical old ( @xmath168gyr ) msp in a _ dense _",
    "cluster core might undergo one or more msp  lmxb recurrence cycles .",
    "thus a few percent of the msps at any one time may be in ( or near ) this recurrent lmxb phase .",
    "this might explain the puzzling luminous qlmxbs x5 and x7 ( ghe01a and heinke et al .",
    "2002 ) in 47  tuc : they could be recently ( @xmath180yr ) revived qlmxbs , in which their underlying msp nature is hidden by a heated ( by the msp wind ) outflow from the disk and roche lobe of the probable main sequence secondaries ( at least for x5 , which may then be similar to 6397-a and 47  tuc - w ; cf .",
    "the ( possibly ) younger system in ngc  6397 has the advantages of having been recently scattered out of a still higher density ( 10@xmath27 pc@xmath43 ) core collapsed cluster core and possibly having exchanged its companion . either or both would likely have restored an accretion phase . thus the msp need not be just `` born , '' as suggested by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; it may instead have just been reborn .",
    "in contrast , the msp in m28 is both 10  younger , single and in a lower density core and so is unlikely to have gone through a renewed accretion phase .",
    "this msp  lmxb recycling scenario would imply : ( i ) a population of msps with main sequence or red straggler secondaries ( either primordial or re - exchanged ) like 6397-a which may be largely eclipsed ( in radio ) by mass loss and dominated by hard shocked gas emission , ( ii ) a strong dependence for this multiply - recycled population to occur primarily in clusters with largest central mass density @xmath181 = n@xmath182 m and core radius r@xmath183 , and thus total interaction rate ( @xmath184 ) such as terzan  5 , and ( iii ) that multiple msp ",
    "lmxb phases may be more likely , thus yielding @xmath71 burial and altered @xmath66 and suppressed magnetospheric emission , in msps with main sequence companions .",
    "msps with either main sequence or slightly evolved secondaries ( e.g. 47  tuc - w or 6397-a ; cf .   4 ) are also most likely to contain re - exchanged secondaries which may have anomalous values ( as might 6397-a ) from the braking torque supplied by a mis - aligned crust - core spin coupling due to the renewed accretion phase(s ) from the re - exchanged secondary",
    ". even an original secondary , if driven back into contact or if marginally filling its roche lobe , could give rise to enhanced values : when accretion stops , the crust is spinning faster than the core , which then exerts a braking torque on the crust ( and b - field ) of the msp .",
    "the timescale for equilibrium to be established is uncertain but likely to be relevant for msps with companions closest to filling their roche lobes ( hence the main sequence or subgiant systems ) which have most recently accreted .",
    "these main sequence systems , which likely evolve into the short period ( 1.55.5h ) group identified by camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , also have longer lifetimes to undergo binary scattering than those spun - up from sub - giant companions and now in the longer period ( 0.42.4d ) group with he - wd companions .",
    "however this lifetime is partly offset by the larger binary cross sections for the he - wd group , so both are expected to undergo scattering in dense cores .",
    "the generally larger orbital eccentricities for he - wd secondary msps in globulars vs. those in the disk has previously been noted ( phinney 1992 ) as evidence for interaction of these msps with cluster stars .",
    "the large eccentricity of 47  tuc - h ( fcl01 ) suggests it has undergone such an encounter .",
    "in this paper we have examined the x - ray properties of the full msp populations in 47  tuc and ngc  6397 localized via radio timing .",
    "the large sample of msps resolved by chandra in 47  tuc , and the single system in ngc  6397 , allow a number of conclusions to be drawn :    * the msps in 47  tuc and ngc  6397 are surprisingly uniform in despite a much larger variation in @xmath12 .",
    "the l@xmath23correlation appears to be significantly flatter than for a ( smaller ) sample of msps in the field as well as the isolated ( and young ) msp in m28 .",
    "the correspondingly flatter l@xmath23@xmath66 correlation suggests that the 47  tuc ( and ngc  6397 ) msps may have @xmath71 and thus @xmath66 configurations systematically different ( e.g. multipole components ) from field msps and which prolong thermal and suppress magnetospheric x - ray emission . * the msps in 47  tuc",
    "are dominated by thermal emission sources , consistent with bb emission from the pulsar polar caps .",
    "at least one ( 47  tuc - j ) must also have significant non - thermal emission , which may arise from the pulsar wind interacting with the companion ( see below ) . *",
    "the radial distribution of msps in 47  tuc is consistent with the predictions of a multi - mass king model for a distribution of msps with mass ratio @xmath185 times the typical cluster stellar mass in the core , i.e.  a msp system mass of @xmath186 .",
    "* from the distribution of chandra sources with similarly soft x - ray colors , as well as the total counts detected in soft and medium bands vs. cluster radius , the number of msp candidates with 1 10@xmath1 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath2  is estimated to be 3590 , allowing for the plausible contamination of by dra and soft cv systems and incompleteness of the detection for faint sources near the cluster center .",
    "the relative number of msps detected in the complete soft x - ray vs. radio samples suggests the radio emission is beamed with beaming factor 0.20.5 ( times any soft x - ray beaming , which is presumably isotropic ) .",
    "* a larger population of still fainter msps ( @xmath187 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath2 ) could be detected in x - rays than in the radio , given the relatively flat l@xmath23l@xmath125 correlation seen for 47  tuc msps .",
    "if the excess of soft vs. medium band counts in the cluster core is due to fainter msps , they must have relatively lower luminosity and lower temperatures than the identified msps . *",
    "the one ( binary ) msp system identified in the core - collapsed globular ngc  6397 is consistent with the l@xmath23relation of the 47  tuc sample despite its very different spectrum , which must be dominated by non - thermal or bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "its harder x - ray emission must ( largely ) arise from an extended source , possibly resulting from interaction of the relativistic wind from the msp with mass loss from its companion star .",
    "the fact that it is still consistent with the @xmath3 @xmath32 relation found for the thermal msps in 47  tuc suggests that both the pulsar wind luminosity and polar cap heating are governed by the total polar cap current ( @xmath3 @xmath32 ; cf .",
    "if is enhanced by renewed accretion or second exchanges , the electromagnetic spindown rate and corresponding reduced may correlate with the thermal component of ( to be measured ) as for 47  tuc . *",
    "the enhanced thermal luminosity , small emission areas and extension to larger msp ages , for the 47  tuc msps vs. the hm02 models suggests the surface magnetic field might be multipole ( dipole at the light cylinder radius and probable radio emission region ) , possibly by field perturbations from repeated accretion events due to encounters or re - exchanges of the secondaries of these msps in dense cluster cores .",
    "alternatively , the extended pair heating ( and thermal x - rays ) could arise ( harding , muslimov , & zhang  2002 ) if the nss in these msps are more massive or ( given their radial distribution ) more compact .",
    "if re - exchanged secondaries are present ( as perhaps for 6397-a and 47  tuc - w ) , apparent and thus values may be enhanced by core - crust coupling drag effects over their purely electromagnetic spindown values which give rise to heating their companions .",
    "some evidence for a similar `` excess '' value is available for 47  tuc - w ( edmonds et al .",
    "2002 ) , but as with 6397-a these estimates are subject to uncertain heating efficiencies and transport effects ( which might heat the backside of the tidally - locked secondary ) .",
    "* ngc  6397 appears to be deficient in its total msp population per unit mass compared with 47  tuc ( ghe01b ) , if most cluster msps are like the 47  tuc sample and dominated by soft thermal sources .",
    "only 35 such objects are found in the sample of 20 chandra sources detected , with limits a factor of 2 lower than in 47  tuc ( ghe01b ) .",
    "most of the other chandra sources in ngc  6397 with comparable x - ray colors ( or actual spectra ) are identified with cvs ( optically ; cf .",
    "ghe01b and references therein ) and thus not likely to be additional msps",
    ". however it is possible that a few of the main sequence binaries , or by dra candidates ( tge01 ) could also harbor msp primaries as is the case for 6397-a . *",
    "conversely , the very large possible by dra population in 47  tuc ( up to 10@xmath188 are possible ; r.  gilliland , private communication ) may contain a significant sample of msps as may have occurred in 6397-a : those that have likely had a cluster main sequence star exchanged _ into _ the binary , displacing the probable degenerate secondary which had evolved from the original mass donor to spin up the msp . if the 6397-a system with such a secondary ( now evolved or bloated ; cf .   4 ) is typical , and mass loss is more readily driven off its near roche - lobe filling secondary by the msp wind pressure ( burderi et al .",
    "2002 ) , then these systems will likely be dominated by shocked gas and appear hard . since these main sequence secondary msps will typically have larger msp heating ( given their larger secondaries ) and thus mass loss , they may be largely eclipsed until their secondaries have been ablated to become the very low mass group ( 0.02@xmath189 ) found ( camilo et al .",
    "2000 ) in the 47  tuc msps .",
    "thus the total msp sample in 47  tuc would include faint hard sources as well as the soft , thermal - dominated , systems and the total msp population would exceed the 35 - 90 estimated from the soft source population alone .",
    "we shall obtain a very deep ( 300ksec ) cycle 3 chandra observation of 47  tuc to probe the complete msp population as well as to better constrain and measure x - ray colors and actual spectra to test emission models . the hard spectra msps (",
    "e.g. 47  tuc - j ) may be variable ( as is 6397-a ) , and hard components should be detectable in other eclipsing msps ( e.g. 47  tuc - o ) .",
    "the interlocking puzzles of compact binary populations ( e.g. msps vs. by dra systems ) and compact object populations ( msps vs. cvs , as measures of ns vs. wd populations ) in globular clusters offer new insights into the stellar and dynamical evolution of these oldest stellar systems in the galaxy .    we thank paulo freire and michael kramer for help with and discussions regarding the radio data , ron gilliland for help with the hst data , werner becker for comments on the paper , alice harding for comments on pc models ,",

    "<S> the radial distribution of 40 soft chandra sources in 47  tuc is consistent with a @xmath8 component in a multi - mass king model and with the identified msp sample . </S>",
    "<S> the implied total msp population in 47  tuc with 10@xmath1 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath2  is 35 - 90 , and can constrain the relative beaming in radio vs. soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  6397 is relatively deficient in msps ; its single detected example may have been re - exchanged out of the cluster core . </S>"
