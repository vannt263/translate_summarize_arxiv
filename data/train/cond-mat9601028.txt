    "vicinal surfaces inevitably have steps which are , in general , perpendicular to the miscut direction . for the @xmath1",
    "reconstructed surfaces like au(110 ) and pt(110 ) , however , the situation is different when the surface is miscut towards the ( 010 ) orientation .",
    "recent scanning - tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) observations revealed that the single - height difference steps are not parallel to @xmath2 $ ] , but run roughly in the @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] directions @xcite .",
    "the steps thus cross and form a network , also called `` textured pattern '' or `` fish skin , '' according to the specific shape of the terraces bound by the steps .",
    "a specific property of the steps on reconstructed fcc ( 110 ) surfaces is the anisotropy in their energy .",
    "the step energy is high ( of the order @xmath5 ev ) for steps perpendicular to the missing rows and low ( @xmath6 ev ) when they are parallel to the missing rows .",
    "two types of low - energy single - height - difference steps can be formed , the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 steps , after the size of their exposed @xmath9 facets , see fig .",
    "[ steps ] .",
    "the two types of steps have opposite lateral shifts in the topmost atomic row positions so that the rows on the right hand and on the left hand terraces are in phase .",
    "in general , the two types of steps have different energies .",
    "calculation with the embedded - atom method tells us that the @xmath7 steps have lower energy than the @xmath8 steps @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath10 are also the predominant steps seen in stm on au(110 ) and pt(110 ) @xcite .",
    "the difference in energy is connected with chirality , i.e. , the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 steps are not equivalent @xcite . in the strong chirality regime when the energy of the @xmath13 step is much higher than the energy of the @xmath10 step , only the @xmath7 steps are thermally excited . here",
    "we will consider the strong chirality case so that the presence of the @xmath8 steps is negligible . at each @xmath7",
    "step the phase in the position of the topmost atomic rows is shifted laterally by @xmath14 .",
    "two @xmath7 steps together thus cause a phase shift of @xmath15 , they form an ising ( antiphase ) domain boundary , the missing rows on the terraces @xmath16 and @xmath17 are out of phase , see fig .",
    "[ steps](b ) . for this reason",
    ", the @xmath10 steps can not make overhangs ( loops back , shown in fig .",
    "[ overhangs](a ) ) in the @xmath18 $ ] direction @xcite .",
    "if the overhangs were allowed , then one can get from @xmath16 to @xmath17 around the overhang without crossing any domain boundary or step , so the @xmath16 and @xmath17 terraces should be in phase . like in the four - state potts model , ( a multiple of ) four steps must meet in a vertex ( at least two lines cross or four lines terminate ) .    as already mentioned , a miscut of a @xmath19 surface towards the @xmath20 orientation is expected to produce steps , parallel to the @xmath2 $ ] ( @xmath21 ) axis .",
    "the energy of such steps is very high because some additional surface - atoms bonds are broken there .",
    "meandering of steps in the @xmath22 ( @xmath18 $ ] ) direction , on the other hand , creates sections , parallel to the @xmath22 direction , which have much lower energy than the sections parallel to the @xmath21 axis . at finite temperature , therefore , the steps are not straight lines along the @xmath21 axis but make many thermally excited excursions in the @xmath22 direction . however , as the overhangs in the @xmath22 direction are forbidden in the strong chirality regime , and the overhangs in the @xmath21 direction are energetically costly and rare as they increase the number of broken bonds ( see fig .",
    "[ overhangs](b ) ) , the step excursions are possible only in one direction . depending on the orientation of steps ,",
    "the step excursions are either in the @xmath23 ( `` up , '' left - hand step in fig .",
    "[ steps](b ) ) or in the @xmath24 direction ( `` down , '' right - hand step in fig .",
    "[ steps](b ) ) .",
    "notice that the steps of the same kind can not cross .",
    "when the imposed inclination is exactly in the @xmath22 direction , there must be an equal density of `` up '' and `` down '' steps which inevitably interpenetrate , the steps form a network , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ patterns ] , which was also observed in the scanning - tunnelling microscopy @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the stability of step patterns .",
    "special emphasis will be on thermally - induced but chirality - restricted meandering of steps and on the elastic interactions between them . in the following section we shall analyse the energy and entropy of different step configurations and of the step crossings .",
    "the elastic interaction energy between the steps , calculated in section 3 , will be used to evaluate the free energy in section 4 . in section 5",
    "the model will be applied to the reconstructed surfaces of au(110 ) and pt(110 ) .",
    "at a single - height step which is perpendicular to the missing rows , one atomic bond along the missing rows is broken per unit length @xmath25 .",
    "the step energy @xmath26 ( per unit length ) is high ( @xmath27 ) , a step is seldomly thermally excited in this direction .",
    "however , with the miscut towards the @xmath20 orientation , such steps are imposed on the surface .",
    "the average step separation in the @xmath22 direction ( measured in units of atom spacings @xmath28 ) is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the average number of atoms in a top row on a terrace and @xmath31 the miscut angle .",
    "meandering without overhangs introduces sections of steps parallel to the @xmath22 direction but maintains the total number of broken bonds constant .",
    "the energy of such sections ( per @xmath28 ) is denoted by @xmath32 and is much smaller than @xmath26 . if we neglect the energies of kinks and take into account that the overhangs are forbidden by the strong chirality condition , the energy of a step that extends @xmath33 unit cells in the @xmath21 and @xmath30 atom spacings in the @xmath22 directions ( see fig . [ patterns ] ) is simply @xmath34 .",
    "meandering of steps introduces also vertices , crossings of `` up '' with `` down '' steps . at a vertex two opposite steps",
    "meet and form a short segment ( length @xmath35 ) of a narrow ising domain wall oriented parallel to the @xmath22 axis and with the energy @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the vertex energy is @xmath37 and it is related to the short - range elastic interaction between the steps . from the experimental evidence of separate ising ( deconstruction ) and roughening ( or wetting ) transitions @xcite , the conclusion was reached that the interaction is weak but attractive , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the average density of vertices is @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath30 is determined by the miscut angle and @xmath33 will be a variational parameter , related to the average angle @xmath40 at which two opposite steps cross : @xmath41 .",
    "thermally induced step fluctuations increase the step energy on one hand but also the entropy on the other hand . in the following , we shall approximate the step texture by a regular lattice of vertices connected by step segments which fluctuate without overhangs .",
    "a step segment with fixed ends at @xmath42 and @xmath43 has @xmath44 different configurations with the same step energy .",
    "the free energy of such a segment and one vertex is @xmath45 this free energy expression is minimal at finite @xmath46 .",
    "however , this step free energy is not complete and the minimum is at wrong @xmath46 . in the following section the elastic contribution to the free energy",
    "will be calculated .",
    "long - range elastic interaction between steps has been first discussed by marchenko and parshin @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "a step exerts elastic forces which result in an elastic displacement field in the bulk .",
    "the displacement field of a step interacts with the elastic forces of other steps and the interaction energy is the elastic contribution to the surface free energy density .    in the continuum",
    "elasticity theory , the force on the underlying elastic continuum exerted by the step @xmath47 running parallel to the @xmath48 axis ( which is , in general , not parallel to @xmath22 ) is described by a force doublet localized at the step @xmath47 @xcite : @xmath49 @xmath50 describes the local stretch of the surface which is the same for the `` up '' and `` down '' steps , and @xmath51 is a local torque , which tends to twist the crystal around the @xmath48 axis , @xmath52 is the ( tangential ) surface stress .    as usually",
    ", we will calculate the elastic energy neglecting the fluctuations of the step ( assuming straight lines ) and assuming an isotropic bulk .",
    "the elastic interaction energy between two parallel steps @xmath47 and @xmath53 a distance @xmath54 apart is @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the young modulus and @xmath57 the poisson ratio",
    ". when the surface is covered with an infinite array of equidistant parallel steps , the step interacts with all the other steps .",
    "if @xmath54 is the distance between two neighbouring steps , the elastic contribution to the surface energy density is @xmath58 parallel steps of the same kind always repel .",
    "now we will calculate the elastic interaction energy of an `` up '' step with a `` down '' step that cross at @xmath59 .",
    "let the step 1 be along the @xmath48 axis and let the angle between the steps be @xmath40 .",
    "the elastic interaction energy , if both steps are infinitely long , is : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the displacement field of the second step at @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 the shortest distance between the point @xmath62 and the step 2 , @xmath65 since the two crossing steps are always opposite to one another , we have @xmath66 , whereas @xmath67 . partial integration of ( [ ephi ] ) over @xmath68 yields : @xmath69.\\ ] ] obviously , the continuum theory breaks down for small @xmath64 , therefore we integrate over @xmath70 and incorporate the remaining short - range interaction into the vertex energy @xmath71 .",
    "the energy of two crossing steps is then : @xmath72      { 1\\over \\sin \\phi } + w. \\label{e12}\\ ] ] the expression ( [ e12 ] ) diverges for @xmath73 when the steps overlap .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that the square bracket reduces to @xmath74 for parallel steps of the same kind ( @xmath75 ) and to @xmath76 for opposite ( antiparallel , @xmath77 ) steps , in agreement with @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) it is also evident that two perpendicular steps do not interact elastically .",
    "using the results of the previous sections , the free energy density ( per unreconstructed surface unit cell ) becomes equal to : @xmath78     \\label{fe2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79    @xmath80 @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    the first term in ( [ fe2 ] ) is the energy of a step , parallel to the @xmath21 axis . at constant miscut angle , the first term does not influence the equilibrium shape of the step patterns , it only shifts the energy .",
    "the second term is the contribution of the step segments that are parallel to the @xmath22 axis and a contribution from the vertex energy .",
    "the third and the fourth terms are the elastic energies of crossing and parallel steps , respectively . the last term is the entropy contribution to the free energy assuming a regular lattice of vertices .",
    "the entropy tends to increase the density of steps and to decrease the angle between the opposite steps .",
    "since the entropy is calculated for a step fluctuating only within a finite , @xmath85 rectangle , the `` loss of entropy '' which leads to a @xmath86 repulsion between parallel steps @xcite is properly taken into account in ( [ fe2 ] ) .    in principle , the ratio @xmath87 is arbitrary , @xmath88 .",
    "however , the free energy diverges for @xmath89 and goes to @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 is determined from the condition that @xmath93 is minimal and it is finite at finite temperature .",
    "the above results will now be applied to investigate the stability of step patterns on au(110 ) and pt(110 ) surfaces at room temperature ( @xmath94 mev ) . at this temperature , the surface diffusion ( of au )",
    "is probably high enough to enable equilibration of steps on lengthscales of @xmath95  in less than an hour or so @xcite .",
    "the parameters , used in the estimates are collected in table [ parameters ] .",
