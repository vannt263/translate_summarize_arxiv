    "thermonuclear ( type i ) x - ray bursts are observed from @xmath5 of the @xmath6 low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) discovered to date @xcite .",
    "they recur every few hours to days , when the accreted surface layer of the neutron star ignites and is incinerated by hydrogen and helium burning .",
    "brightness oscillations with millisecond periods are observed during thermonuclear x - ray bursts in 13 lmxbs @xcite .",
    "they arise during burst onset because the stellar photosphere is temporarily patchy while the thermonuclear flame spreads from its ignition point to cover the star .",
    "a surprising property of the burst oscillations is that they often persist into the tails of bursts , after the flame is expected to have engulfed the star @xcite .",
    "equally surprising is how sinusoidal the oscillations are .",
    "@xcite analyzed the harmonic content of 59 oscillations from six sources , observed with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , and found that the fourier amplitudes of integer and half - integer harmonics are less than 5 and 10 per cent of the maximum signal respectively .",
    "these data imply that if there is one hot spot on the surface , it must lie near the rotational pole or cover an entire hemisphere , whereas if there are two , antipodal hot spots , they must lie near the rotational equator @xcite .",
    "most theories that explain why the oscillations persist into the tails of the bursts , e.g. uneven heating / cooling during photospheric uplift @xcite , or cyclones driven by zonal shear in a geostrophic flow @xcite , are hard pressed to account for the pattern of hot spots implied by the fourier data .",
    "global @xmath7-modes in the neutron star ocean can divide the photosphere into symmetric halves @xcite , but the physical mechanism converting @xmath7-mode density perturbations to brightness oscillations is unclear @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that differential rotation between the pole and equator of @xmath8 per cent can also excite unstable modes .    in this paper",
    ", we show that an equatorial belt of intense magnetic field , compressed by accreted material spreading away from the magnetic poles , can impede thermal transport between the hemispheres of the star . in  2 , we review the physics of magnetic burial and compute the maximum field strength and width of the equatorial magnetic barrier . in  3 , we estimate the efficiency of thermal transport across the barrier by conduction , convection , radiation , and ageostrophic shear , and investigate whether cyclonic flows can disrupt the barrier .",
    "the implications for the harmonic content of burst oscillations are explored in  4 .",
    "in the process of magnetic burial , material accreting onto a neutron star accumulates in a column at the magnetic polar cap , until the hydrostatic pressure at the base of the column overcomes the magnetic tension and matter spreads equatorward , dragging along frozen - in polar magnetic field lines to form an equatorial magnetic belt or ` tutu ' .",

    "the equatorial magnetic field strength increases in inverse proportion to the surface area of the equatorial belt , by flux conservation .",
    "the lorentz force per unit volume exerted by the compressed equatorial field [ figure [ fig : polar](b ) ] balances the thermal pressure gradient [ figure [ fig : polar](c ) ] , and gravity , preventing the accreted matter from spreading to the equator .    in the steady state",

    "we also assume north - south symmetry and adopt the boundary conditions @xmath31 dipole at @xmath32 ( line tying ) , @xmath33 at @xmath34 , and @xmath35 at large @xmath7 .",
    "the line - tying approximation artificially prevents accreted material from sinking , so the computed @xmath12 is an upper limit .",
    "equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are solved numerically using an iterative relaxation scheme and analytically by green functions , producing equilibria like figure [ fig : polar ] .",
    "the compressed magnetic field in the equatorial belt emerges approximately perpendicular to the stellar surface , with opposite sign in the two hemispheres . near the equator",
    ", @xmath36 falls off roughly as @xmath37 \\exp[-(r - r_{*})/h]$ ] , where @xmath38 is the hydrostatic scale height , @xmath39 is the belt thickness , and the factor 0.7 comes from empirically fitting to the numerical results . the maximum magnetic field strength in the belt , @xmath40 , computed numerically as a function of @xmath3 , is plotted in figure [ fig : magma ] .",

    "also plotted in figure [ fig : magma ] is the half - width half - maximum thickness of the belt , fitted by @xmath44 .",
    "we find that @xmath39 decreases as @xmath40 increases , as expected from magnetic flux conservation , but not exactly as @xmath45 , because @xmath46 is underestimated numerically at the equator by @xmath47 per cent ( flux loss due to finite grid resolution ) .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : bmax ] ) and the above scalings of @xmath39 versus @xmath3 do not include ohmic diffusion , which is discussed further in  2.3 and ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "grad - shafranov equilibria are difficult to compute directly from ( [ eq : gradshafranov ] ) and ( [ eq : fpsi ] ) for @xmath48 , because the magnetic topology changes abruptly : magnetic bubbles form which are disconnected from the surface , hinting at time - dependent processes which the steady - state theory can not describe .",
    "in addition , the iterative relaxation scheme struggles to handle steep field gradients .",
    "therefore the results in figure [ fig : magma ] for @xmath49 are computed by direct numerical simulation using zeus-3d , a multipurpose , time - dependent , ideal - mhd code for astrophysical fluid dynamics which uses staggered - mesh finite differencing and operator splitting in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "we load the grad - shafranov equilibrium for @xmath50 into zeus-3d ; double @xmath3 quasistatically over 250 alfvn times with inflow ( and hence radial @xmath11 ) boundary conditions ; stop the inflow and allow @xmath51 to relax to a dipole at large @xmath7 ; then iterate to reach @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "an isothermal equation of state is chosen and self - gravity is switched off .",
    "the experiment is performed for @xmath53 ( for computational efficiency ) and scaled to neutron star conditions ( @xmath54 ) according to @xmath55 ; this scaling is verified numerically for the range of @xmath3 in figure [ fig : magma ] .",
    "distorted ideal - mhd equilibria are often disrupted by parker and interchange instabilities . remarkably , however , this is not true for the equilibrium in figure [ fig : polar ] .",
    "figure [ fig : magstable ] shows the results of an experiment in which the equilibrium is loaded into zeus-3d , perturbed , and evolved for 500 alfvn times @xcite .",
    "[ the alfvn time is defined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the alfvn speed averaged over the grid . ]",
    "it is marginally stable ; @xmath40 oscillates via magnetosonic ( phase speed @xmath58 ) and alfvn ( phase speed @xmath59 ) modes which are damped by numerical dissipation .",
    "the configuration _ already _ represents the end point ( reached quasistatically ) of the nonlinear parker instability of an initially dipolar field overlaid with accreted material .",
    "it is not interchange unstable because line tying prevents flux tubes from squeezing past each other .",
    "that said , we caution that we have not yet investigated the full gamut of three - dimensional mhd instabilities ; cross - field mass transport can not be categorically ruled out .",
    "another pathway to cross - field mass transport is if the magnetic belt relaxes by ohmic diffusion , either during quiescence or during a burst itself . during quiescence",
    ", diffusion occurs most rapidly at the base of the accreted layer . in the relaxation time approximation , with coulomb logarithms set to @xmath60 , the electron - phonon conductivity for a hydrogen - helium mixture is @xmath61 ,",
    "the density at the base of the accreted layer is @xmath62 @xcite , and hence the ohmic diffusion time - scale across the equatorial belt ( at the base of the accreted layer ) is @xmath63 , much longer than the burst time - scale , where we rewrite @xmath39 in terms of @xmath3 . during a burst ,",
    "diffusion occurs most rapidly in the burning layer .",
    "the temperature of the burning layer rises isobarically until the radiation pressure dominates the hydrostatic pressure , reaching @xmath64 k for a typical ignition column @xcite .",
    "the elevated temperature and reduced density lower @xmath65 and accelerate ohmic diffusion . in the burning layer ( @xmath66 g @xmath67 )",
    ", we find @xmath68 yr , still much longer than the burst time - scale .",
    "ohmic diffusion will be modelled self - consistently in a future paper .",
    "does the equatorial magnetic belt impede thermal transport enough to stop the thermonuclear flame in a type i x - ray burst from spreading from one hemisphere to another ?",
    "a burst is initiated locally by a thin shell thermal instability @xcite .",
    "as the nuclear burning time - scale is much shorter than the time to accrete the minimum column for ignition , the accreted layer ignites at a single point , most likely at the equator where gravity is rotationally reduced , and the thermonuclear flame spreads away either as a deflagration front @xcite , by detonation @xcite , or as a cyclone driven by zonal shear @xcite .",
    "detonation , which occurs when the nuclear burning time - scale is less than the vertical sound crossing time - scale , requires a thick ( @xmath69 m ) column of fuel and hence a low accretion rate ( @xmath70 yr@xmath71 ) .",
    "deflagration occurs most commonly , with the front propagating at a speed set by the heat flux and convection @xcite .",
    "note that temperature fluctuations leading to single - point ignition are difficult to create because the sound crossing time around the star is very short , but coriolis forces can assist by balancing sideways pressure gradients when the star is rapidly rotating @xcite .",
    "we estimate below how the equatorial magnetic belt modifies heat transport in these scenarios .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath72 of degenerate electrons at the atmosphere - ocean boundary of a magnetized neutron star , where h / he burning occurs , was calculated by @xcite .",
    "we extract approximate values for the conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field from figures 5 and 6 of that paper , obtaining @xmath73 in units of @xmath74 in the regime @xmath75 g @xmath76 g @xmath67 , @xmath77 g @xmath78 g , and @xmath79 k @xmath80 k. note that @xmath81 at the equator is reduced @xmath79 times relative to its value before accretion commences ( @xmath82 ) and , for reference , one has @xmath83 at @xmath84 k ,",
    "@xmath85 g @xcite .",
    "we estimate the conduction time - scale across the magnetic barrier from @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the specific heat capacity of a degenerate fermi gas @xcite , finding @xmath88 which is safely longer than the duration of the burst .",
    "note that this estimate does not include corrections due to electron - electron scattering and impurity scattering .",
    "furthermore , our fit smoothes over the wiggles in the solid curves of figures 5 and 6 in @xcite , which arise from quantization into landau orbitals .      in a strong magnetic field , photons polarized perpendicular to @xmath51 dominate radiative transport . in the burning ( helium ) layer ,",
    "where thomson scattering dominates , the rosseland mean opacity @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 , decreasing in inverse proportion to the square of the cyclotron frequency ( @xmath91 ) @xcite .",
    "hence the optical depth of the barrier is @xmath92 , i.e. @xmath93 the optical depth ( [ eq : opdepth ] ) is a _ lower _",
    "limit obtained by assuming that radiation is transported from one hemisphere to the other near the surface , at the depth of the burning layer ( @xmath94 ) rather than at the base of the accreted column ( @xmath95 ) . hence the peak flux penetrating the barrier is @xmath96 erg s@xmath71 @xmath97 ( for @xmath98 ) , which is insufficient to heat the other ( quiescent ) hemisphere above its ignition temperature ( @xmath99 k ) ( assuming thermal equilibrium and applying the stefan - boltzmann law ) .",
    "interestingly , once @xmath40 exceeds @xmath100 g , we find @xmath101 and the magnetic belt becomes optically thin .",
    "vertical heat propagation is not considered here .",
    "equation ( [ eq : opdepth ] ) can be generalized in several ways .",
    "mode coupling @xcite can cause a fraction @xmath102 of the perpendicular mode photons to convert into parallel mode photons , so that the opacity scales @xmath103 , increasing the field strength required for the belt to become optically thin .",
    "vacuum polarization @xcite , along with proton - cyclotron resonance , gives sharp spikes in the frequency response of the atmospheric opacity .",
    "however , the resonant densities for vacuum polarization ( @xmath104 g @xmath67 ) are achieved at shallow depths , well above the burning layer .",
    "@xcite estimated the convective speed in the burning layer in terms of the mixing length , @xmath105 , and thermal time - scale , @xmath106 , finding @xmath107 .",
    "this is consistent with the upper bound @xmath108 obtained if @xmath109 is transported entirely by the mechanical flux @xmath110 .",
    "it is also consistent with the observed burst rise time @xmath111 s @xcite .",
    "convection is stabilized magnetically if the magnetic tension exceeds the ram pressure @xmath112 , which occurs for @xmath113 g. this condition is met comfortably in the equatorial belt .",
    "the magnetic field can also quench convection @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that inhomogeneous cooling drives zonal currents which are unstable to the formation of cyclones , as in planetary atmospheres .",
    "this may explain why the coherent oscillations observed in the tails of some type i x - ray bursts persist for many rise times .",
    "the drift in oscillation frequency ( @xmath114 hz ) during the burst is attributed to the coriolis drift of the cyclone in the frame of the star , although theory predicts larger frequency drifts ( @xmath47 hz ) than those observed .",
    "the oscillation amplitude in the burst tails ( @xmath115 ) is governed by processes other than magnetic burial , e.g. small - scale magnetic fields generated by an mhd dynamo in the burning front , which are confined to the ashes after the burst , while the freshly accreted matter remains unmagnetized @xcite .",
    "ageostrophic shear flow moves hot material ahead of the burning front and draws fresh fuel into it at the flame speed @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the scale height of the incinerated ocean , @xmath118 is the local coriolis parameter , @xmath119 is the angular frequency of the star , and @xmath120 is the nuclear burning time - scale .",
    "magnetic tension stabilizes ageostrophic shear for @xmath121 g @xmath122 .",
    "in other words , when the cyclonic flame runs into the equatorial magnetic belt , it is reflected ; conversely , ageostrophic shear can not disrupt the belt .",
    "latitudininal shear instabilities , a possible source of burst oscillations @xcite , may disrupt the magnetic belt and provide one motivation for extending our burial model to three dimensions in the future .",
    "polar magnetic burial creates an intense , equatorial belt of magnetic field which can thermally isolate the magnetic hemispheres of an accreting neutron star .",
    "the maximum magnetic field strength in the belt , @xmath1 g , is sufficient to prevent heat transport by conduction , radiation , convection , and ageostrophic shear .",
    "the conduction time - scale @xmath123 yr exceeds the cooling time of the incinerated material ; the magnetic belt is opaque ( optical depth @xmath124 ) ; convection is stabilized magnetically ( @xmath125 ) ; and so is ageostrophic shear ( @xmath126 ) . however , the conclusion that the hemispheres are thermally isolated by the magnetic belt is less secure at large accreted masses ( @xmath127 ) , where the grad - shafranov and zeus-3d calculations in section 2 are hampered by numerical difficulties , and ohmic diffusion ( which we do not incorporate self - consistently ) becomes important .",
    "thermal isolation of the magnetic hemispheres is consistent with the highly sinusoidal light curves of millisecond oscillations in thermonuclear bursts in lmxbs @xcite . during the rise of the burst ,",
    "oscillations are caused by the spreading of a hot spot , probably in the form of a cyclone @xcite . in the tail of the burst ,",
    "the hot spot is sequestered in one hemisphere @xcite , and misalignment of the magnetic and spin axes guarantees that we observe persistent oscillations at the spin frequency .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that bursts occasionally occur in quick succession , separated by a @xmath128 minute interval , compared to an interval of several hours between typical bursts @xcite .",
    "such burst pairs are consistent with the model of magnetic burial : if a burst ignites one hemisphere , the other remains dormant and can , in principle , ignite shortly thereafter when more material accretes .",
    "if this explanation is valid , one would expect that there are no triple bursts , that the fluences emitted in each half of a burst pair are roughly equal , and that the number of burst pairs relative to normal bursts increases as the ignition probability per unit time increases ( relative to @xmath4 ) . ) , it is more likely that the second hemisphere will ignite shortly after the first ( before the first has a chance to refill and ignite again ) .",
    "a faster burst rate may be associated with more pairs , but gaps in the satellite data make it difficult to be sure . ] a more detailed calculation is required to resolve whether the 10-min intervals are caused by delayed heat propagation through the magnetic belt .",
    "@xcite showed that the bright burning region must cover @xmath129 in latitude in order to match the upper limit on the observed ratio of harmonic to fundamental amplitudes , which implies @xmath130 .",
    "if the scaling of @xmath39 versus @xmath3 in  [ sec : equatorialbelt ] is taken at face value , this requires @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , for the belt to be optically thick , we need @xmath132 (  [ sec : radiation ] ) . apparently then",
    ", only a narrow range of accreted masses ( @xmath133 ) can account for the observations .",
    "the above @xmath39 scaling , which depends steeply on @xmath3 , does not tell the whole story , because ohmic diffusion is not incorporated self - consistently .",
    "equatorward hydromagnetic spreading is arrested when the accretion time - scale exceeds the ohmic diffusion time - scale @xcite , softening the dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath39 on @xmath3 in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "ohmic diffusion arrests magnetic compression for @xmath134 , where @xmath135 @xcite is the accreted mass at which the accretion time - scale exceeds the ohmic diffusion time - scale . including this effect ,",
    "@xmath39 is modified to the maximum of @xmath136 and @xmath137 $ ] , and the belt remains optically thick even for @xmath138 (  [ sec : radiation ] ) .    only 70 out of 160 lmxbs",
    "undergo bursts , and only 13 exhibit millisecond oscillations .",
    "does the equatorial belt model respect these statistics ? if accretion occurs at the eddington rate , @xmath139 , it takes less than @xmath75 yr to achieve @xmath140 and screen the polar magnetic field , allowing bursts to ignite and creating a thermally insulating equatorial belt .",
    "however , for @xmath141 , the belt becomes optically thin to x - rays and @xmath142 drops below the duration of the burst , potentially allowing the flame to engulf the entire star in lmxbs older than a few times @xmath143 yr . if accretion occurs at @xmath144 , as in accreting millisecond pulsars @xcite , it takes @xmath143 yr to achieve @xmath140 , screen the polar magnetic field , and allow bursts to ignite .",
    "therefore , we do not expect bursts from all accreting millisecond pulsars , but when bursts do occur , we expect to detect oscillations at some level because we have @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( burst time - scale ) for @xmath147 . such is the case , within current observational sensitivity , for sax j1808.4 - 3658 and xte j1814 - 338 .",
    "sources like xte j1814 - 338 , whose oscillations contain harmonics exceeding @xmath148 per cent of the peak amplitude @xcite , may have semi - transparent equatorial belts ; perhaps this millisecond pulsar has experienced interruptions in its accretion history resulting in @xmath149 .",
    "note that , for @xmath150 , ohmic diffusion may magnetize the freshly accreted material @xcite , increasing the polar magnetic field strength and suppressing bursts . also , ignition is more likely near the equator , where gravity is rotationally reduced , but this is where the magnetic field is strongest . the issues of conservative mass - transfer @xcite and differential rotation leading to shear instabilities @xcite are not considered here .    on the face of it , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) accrete many times @xmath151 , yet a strong magnetic field survives .",
    "however , one needs to be cautious .",
    "while the accretion rate in hmxbs can reach @xmath152@xmath153 during either atmospheric roche lobe overflow ( close binaries with orbital period @xmath154 days ) or stellar wind accretion ( wider binaries ) , the typical lifetime of hmxbs as strong x - ray sources is @xmath155@xmath156 yr @xcite .",
    "sub - eddington accretion rates ( @xmath157@xmath158 ) characterize the rest of the companion s main - sequence evolution for @xmath159@xmath160 yr .",
    "these scenarios yield roughly @xmath161 .",
    "mass transfer can also be nonconservative , further reducing @xmath3 , e.g. , in intermediate - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "of course , despite these cautionary remarks , it may well be that some hmxbs do accrete many times @xmath151 .",
    "if so , then either hmxbs are a counterexample to the simple magnetic burial model we have calculated , or else cross - field transport by ohmic diffusion ( which we do not incorporate self - consistently ) becomes important .",
    "a recent model for doubly peaked bursts which are too weak to cause photospheric expansion @xcite proposes that a burning front forms quickly after ignition at or near a pole and propagates quickly towards the equator where it stalls . after a delay ,",
    "the burning front speeds up again into the opposite hemisphere .",
    "while the time between burst peaks ( @xmath47 seconds ) is less than that estimated for burst propagation across the magnetic belt , a weak magnetic belt may explain why the burning front stalls at the equator .    numerical difficulties associated with steep field gradients prevent us from verifying whether our model scales up to @xmath127 .",
    "however , if we continue to respect mass - flux conservation as in ",
    "[ sec : gradshaf ] , it is probable that accreting extra mass does not eliminate the magnetic barrier . even if , for example , there are instabilities which disrupt the equatorial magnetic belt above @xmath162 , the belt does not stay disrupted ; magnetic burial ensures that it reforms as soon as a further @xmath163 is accreted @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath164 is typically accreted in lmxbs , the chances of catching the belt in its disrupted state are slim .                                                                       and",
