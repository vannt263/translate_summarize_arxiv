    "solar flares remain , after almost one hundred years of intense study , an unsolved problem for astrophysics .",
    "we define as _ flare _ the sporadic transformation of magnetic energy to ( 1 ) plasma heating , ( 2 ) particle acceleration , and ( 3 ) plasma flows .",
    "it seems that the total magnetic energy released in a single flare is not equally spread to all three components .",
    "the energetic particles carry a very large fraction of the total energy released during a flare , reaching sometimes up to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "modeling the explosive energy release requires methods that can treat simultaneously the large scale magnetic field structures and the small - scale dissipation events .",
    "the convection zone actively participates in the formation and evolution of large scale structures by rearranging the position of the field lines and at the same time it adds new magnetic flux ( emerging flux ) and new stresses to the existing topologies .",
    "the loss of stability of several loop - like structures forms large scale disturbances ( cme ) , which further disturb the pre - existing and so - far stable large scale structures . in this way",
    ", the 3-d magnetic topologies are constantly forced away from the potential state ( if they ever reach one ) due to slow or abrupt changes in the convection zone .",
    "all these non - potential magnetic stresses force the large - scale magnetic topology to form short - lived , small - scale magnetic discontinuities in order to dissipate the excess energy in localized current sheets .",
    "this conjecture was initially proposed by @xcite , and subsequently it was modeled using 3-d mhd numerical simulations by many researchers ( see for example the work of * ? ? ?",
    "_ we emphasize here that the concept of sudden formation of a distribution of unstable discontinuities inside a well organized large - scale topology has not been appreciated or used extensively enough to model the solar flare phenomenon_.    the scenario of spatially distributed , localized , small - scale dissipation , which moreover evolves in time , is not least supported by the observations which indicate highly fragmented energy dissipation and particle acceleration processes .",
    "there is strong evidence that narrow - band milli - second spike - emission in the radio range is directly associated to the primary energy release events .",
    "the emission itself of the radio - spikes is fragmented in space and time , as is seen in radio - spectrograms and in spatially resolved observations .",
    "it must thus be concluded that also the energy release process is fragmented in space and time , to at least the same degree as is the radio spike - emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "also type iii burst radio - emission , caused by electron beams escaping from flaring regions , exhibits fragmentation as a strong characteristic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is a too simple interpretation of the available data that the large scale structures seen have a relatively simple topology down to all scales .",
    "one approach which is capable to capture the full extent of this interplay of highly localized dissipation in a well - behaved large scale topology ( sporadic flaring ) is based on a special class of models which use the concept of self - organized criticality ( soc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main idea is that active regions evolve by the continuous addition of new or the change of existing magnetic flux on an existing large scale magnetic topology , until at some point(s ) inside the structure magnetic discontinuities are formed and the currents associated with them reach a threshold .",
    "this causes a fast rearrangement of the local magnetic topology and the release of the excess magnetic energy at the unstable point(s ) .",
    "this rearrangement may in - turn cause the lack of stability in the neighborhood , and so forth , leading to the appearance of flares ( avalanches ) of all sizes that follow a well defined statistical law @xcite , which agrees remarkably well with the observed flare statistics @xcite .",
    "the modeling of the solar atmosphere can not be done exclusively with the use of high - resolution mhd numerical codes . the small scale discontinuities easily give rise to kinetic instabilities and anomalous resistivity , which play a very important role , they dramatically change the evolution of even the large scale structures .",
    "on the other hand , numerical codes following the evolution of charged particles in idealized , non - evolving , large - scale current - sheets also fail to capture the spatio - temporal evolution of the magnetic energy dissipation . the extraordinary efficiency of particle acceleration during solar flares questions the use of ideal mhd for the description of flares , since it misses kinetic plasma effects , which yet play a major role in the energy dissipation process and for the local state of the plasma .",
    "the coupling of the large scale and the small scale is extremely difficult to handle , not only in solar physics but in physics in general , and it is the main reason for not having resolved the solar flare problem for so many years @xcite .",
    "our inability to describe properly the coupling between the mhd evolution and the kinetic plasma aspects of the driven flaring region is the main reason behind our lack of understanding of the mechanism(s ) which causes the acceleration of high energy particles .",
    "let us now define more accurately the so called ` acceleration problem ' .",
    "_ we need to understand the mechanism(s ) which accelerate electrons and ions in relatively large numbers to energies well above the relativistic regime on a short time scale with specific energy - spectra for the different isotopes and charge states_.    let us summarize very briefly the main observational constraints for the acceleration processes in solar flares .    *",
    "electron * energies well in excess to 100 kev , and occasionally up to tens of mev , are inferred .",
    "electrons reach @xmath2kev in @xmath3s and higher energies in a few seconds .",
    "the number of electrons required above 20 kev is large for x - class flares and can reach up to @xmath4 electrons per second , although this number is model dependent and not very accurate ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observed spectra in the hard x - rays can be fitted with single or double power - laws , combined often  but not always  with a thermal emission spectrum at the lowest energies @xcite .",
    "the spectra in the microwaves roughly show a power - law decay at high frequencies @xcite .",
    "* ions * ( especially protons ) are inferred to have energies above @xmath0mev and up to @xmath0gev per nucleon .",
    "the 10 mev ions are accelerated on the same time scales as the electrons , with the high energy ions delayed up to @xmath5s .",
    "the total number of ions accelerated may carry the same energy as the electrons .",
    "the continuous component of the @xmath6-ray spectra are usually power laws .",
    "an important finding is the massive enhancement of @xmath7he in very impulsive flares ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* acceleration mechanisms : * numerous books and reviews have been devoted to the challenging problem of particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "the proposed models usually address parts of the problem , and almost all acceleration mechanisms have no clear connection to the large - scale topology and to the magnetic energy release mechanism(s ) .",
    "the most prominent mechanisms are shock waves @xcite , mhd turbulence @xcite , and dc electric fields @xcite .    * mixing acceleration mechanisms : * several inquiries have been made in which different acceleration mechanisms had been mixed .",
    "@xcite analyzed the role of shock drift acceleration ( sda ) when the shock is surrounded by a turbulent spectrum .",
    "as we already mentioned , the sda is fast but not efficient since the particles drifting along the shock - surface s electric field quickly leave the shock .",
    "the presence of turbulence reinforces the acceleration process by providing a magnetic trap around the shock surface and forcing a particle to return many times to the shock surface .",
    "the particle leaves the shock surface , travels a distance @xmath8 inside the turbulent magnetic field , returns back to the shock surface with velocity @xmath9 , drifts a distance @xmath10 along the shock electric field @xmath11 , changing its momentum by @xmath12 , it escapes again , travels a distance @xmath13 before returning back to the shock and drifting along the electric field , in other words , the acceleration - cycle has begun again .",
    "the process repeats itself several times before the particle gains enough energy to escape from the turbulent trap around the shock surface .",
    "let us note some very important characteristics of this acceleration : ( 1 ) the distances @xmath8 traveled by the particle before returning back to the shock are only indirectly relevant to the acceleration , they basically delay the process and influence the overall timing , i.e.  the _ acceleration time _",
    ", another important parameter of the particle acceleration process . ( 2 ) the energy gain depends critically on the lengths @xmath10 the particle drifts along the shock surface , in a statistical sense though , i.e.  on the distribution of the @xmath14 .",
    "( 3 ) the times @xmath15 a particle spends on the shock surface are again crucial for the energy gain , and also , together with the @xmath8 , for the estimation of the acceleration time .",
    "( 4 ) for the total acceleration problem , which concerns the energies reached and the times needed to reach them , all three variables , @xmath16 , are of equal importance .",
    "@xcite discussed a similar problem , placing a current sheet into a region of alfvnic turbulence . also here , the ability of the associated dc electric field to accelerate particles is enhanced by the presence of the mhd turbulence .",
    "the acceleration process is again of a cyclic nature , as in the case of turbulent sda , and the process is again characterized by the three variables @xmath16 .",
    "the turbulent current sheet has several avenues to enhance the acceleration - efficiency since the plasma inflow is dynamically driven and causes a variety of new and still unexplored phenomena .",
    "@xcite analyzed the mixture of stationary mhd turbulence with a dc electric field .",
    "the trapping of the particles inside the turbulent magnetic field causes a new ` collision scale ' , and , in some circumstances , acceleration becomes dependent on an alternative dreicer field , in which particle collisions are replaced by collisions with magnetic irregularities .",
    "actually also the diffusive shock acceleration described above is of a mixed type , having as elements a shock and magnetic turbulence , although turbulence plays a more passive role of just scattering the particles .",
    "it seems that most acceleration mechanisms are more or less of a mixed type .",
    "we can conclude that the mixture of mechanisms enhances the acceleration - efficiency and removes some of the draw - backs attached to the different , isolated mechanisms . a second",
    ", main conclusion we draw is that _ cyclic processes _ , e.g.through trapping around the basic accelerators , are important elements  if not the presupposition  of efficient and fast acceleration in space plasmas .",
    "* can the ucs naturally provide the unification of all the above mechanisms  ? * unstable current sheets ( ucs ) are the regions where magnetic energy is dissipated , and it is natural to ask if they can become the actual source of the energetic particles . according to the existing understanding of ucss , several potential mechanisms for particle acceleration co - exist at a ucs .",
    "plasma flows driving turbulence , shock waves , and dc electric fields are expected to appear simultaneously inside and around a driven and evolving ucs .",
    "if the ucs is located in the middle of a turbulent magnetic topology , all these phenomena will be enhanced and the sporadic external forcing of the plasma inflow into the ucs will create bursts of sporadic acceleration .",
    "the scenario of a single ucs currently enjoys very large popularity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the question is : can one single ucs be the answer to the acceleration problem  ?",
    "we believe that this is impossible since a single , isolated ucs must be enormously large @xmath17 m ) , remain stationary for a long time , and continuously accelerate particles with extreme efficiency in order to provide the required numbers of accelerated particles and the observed acceleration times . from the earth s magnetic tail , it is known that large ucs break up quickly , creating a network of smaller scale ucs , with a specific probability distribution @xmath18 of their characteristic scales , a process which just is a manifestation of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the formation of a large scale helmet above certain loops , driven by erupting filaments can not be excluded entirely and represents a special class of very energetic phenomena @xcite .",
    "we though believe that such a current sheet breaks down on a very short time scale , and the formation of smaller scale current sheets will be unavoidable .",
    "eventually , even in this very special occasion the acceleration probably takes place in an environment similar to the one discussed in this article .",
    "there is a second reason , based on a result on the statistics of flares , for questioning the idea of a single , large - scale ucs that is associated with just one or at most two loops , as in the scenario of the sometimes called standard model ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite determined the frequency - distributions in total emitted energy of flares occurring in the _ same , individual _ active region ( number of flares per unit energy ) , and they find featureless power - law distributions , extending over many decades . if a single ucs would be the basic mechanism behind a flare , then the energy output must be expected to be related to the physical properties of the individual active region , e.g.  to the linear dimensions of the active region and the associated ucs , so that it is at least difficult to imagine how a single - site reconnection model could be able to produce a featureless energy distribution that extends over many decades .    * from single to multiple , small - scale ucs acceleration : * our attempt in this article is to take advantage of the positive properties of isolated ucs as accelerators , but at the same time to assume that the dissipation happens at _ multiple _ , _ small - scale _ sites .",
    "the 3-d magnetic topology , driven from the convection zone , dissipates energy in localized ucs , which are spread inside the coronal active region , providing a natural fragmentation for the energy release and a multiple , distributed accelerator . in this way , the magnetic topology acts as a host for the ucs , and the spatio - temporal distribution of the latter defines the type of a flare , its intensity , the degree of energization and acceleration of the particles , the acceleration time - scales etc . evolving large - scale magnetic topologies",
    "provide a variety of opportunities for acceleration which is not restricted to flares , but can also take place before a flare , and after a flare , being just the manifestation of a more relaxed , but still driven topology . depending thus on the level to which the magnetic topology is stressed ,",
    "particles can be accelerated without a flare to happen , and even long - lived acceleration in non - flaring active regions must be expected to occur .",
    "consequently , the starting point of the model to be introduced below is a driven 3-d magnetic topology , which defines a time - dependent spatial distribution of ucs inside the active region . in this article",
    ", we will focus on the interaction of the ucs with particles .",
    "the details of the mechanisms involved in the acceleration of particles inside the ucs are not essential in a stochastic modeling approach",
    ".    ideas related to the basic approach of this article have been presented earlier @xcite , but remained conceptually simpler , they left many points open for future development , being not that general and complete as approaches as the model we present here . in the approach",
    "we follow here , we make extensive use of new developments in the theory of soc models for flares . also taken into account",
    "are ideas from the theory of complex evolving networks @xcite , adjusted though to the context of plasma physics : the spatially distributed , localized ucs can be viewed as a network , whose nodes are the ucs themselves , and whose edges are the possible particle trajectories between the nodes ( ucs ) .",
    "the particles are moving around in this network , forced to follow the edges , and undergoing acceleration when they pass by a node ( see also fig .  [ plottwo ] ) .",
    "the network is complex in that it has a non - trivial spatial structure , and it is evolving since the nodes ( ucs ) are short - lived , as are the connectivity channels , which ever change during the evolution of a flare .",
    "this instantaneous connectivity of the ucs is an important parameter in our model , it determines to what degree multiple acceleration is imposed onto the system , which in turn influences the instantaneous level of energization and the acceleration time - scale of the particles .    in this article",
    ", we introduce a stochastic , multiple acceleration model for solar flare particle acceleration .",
    "we assume an ensemble of unstable current sheets ( ucs ) , distributed in space in such a way that it reflects a relatively simple large scale topology in which turbulence at small scales is developing . concretely , the ucs in their ensemble form a fractal , as it is the case in the soc models @xcite .",
    "particles move erratically around , and occasionally enter a ucs in which they undergo acceleration .",
    "the acceleration process is taken as a simple dc electric field mechanism .",
    "the basic approach of the model is a combined random walk in position- and momentum - space .",
    "the frame - work we introduce is such that potentially all multiple acceleration models can be formulated in this frame - work , as long as the acceleration takes place in spatially localized , disconnected , small - scale regions .",
    "our main interest here is in the diffusion , acceleration , and heating of the electrons .",
    "we will follow the evolution of the kinetic energy distribution in time and calculate from these distributions the hard x - ray ( hxr ) and microwave spectra , which can be compared to the observations . moreover",
    ", we will shortly inquire the case of ion heating and acceleration .",
    "the basic elements of our model are presented in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we present some of our results , and in section 4 we discuss our findings and propose ways for continuing the exploration of the problem along the path of our modeling approach .",
    "a conclusion is presented in section 5 .",
    "in the model we propose in this article , a 3-d large scale magnetic topology , close to the structures estimated by force - free extrapolations of the photospheric magnetic fields , is the back bone of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ plotone](a ) ) .",
    "the magnetic field lines are the carriers of the high energy particles .",
    "the ucs , which basically are magnetic discontinuities , appear sporadically inside the large scale magnetic topology , and they represent the dissipation areas of the turbulent system ( see fig .  [ plotone](d ) ) .",
    "the characteristics of the ucs , such as size , energy content , etc . , are different from ucs to ucs , following probabilistic laws which in principle should be dictated by the data , most of them though are not directly observable .",
    "the ucs are assumed to be small - scale regions , distributed over space in a complex way .",
    "we thus implement the scenario of fragmented energy release , based on parker s original conjecture @xcite and on the observational evidence of fragmentation in radio spike emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in type",
    "iii radio - emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one way of modeling the appearance , disappearance , and spatial organization of ucs inside a large scale topology is with the use of the extended cellular automaton ( x - ca ) model @xcite .",
    "[ plotone ] illustrates some basic features of the x - ca model .",
    "the x - ca model has as a core a cellular automaton model of the sand - pile type and is run in the state of self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "it is extended to be fully consistent with mhd : the primary grid variable is the vector - potential , and the magnetic field and the current are calculated by means of interpolation as derivatives of the vector potential in the usual sense of mhd , guaranteeing @xmath19 and @xmath20 everywhere in the simulated 3-dimensional volume .",
    "the electric field is defined as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the resistivity .",
    "the latter usually is negligibly small , but if a threshold in the current is locally reached ( @xmath23 ) , then current driven instabilities are assumed to occur , @xmath22 becomes anomalous in turn , and the resistive electric field locally increases drastically .",
    "these localized regions of intense electric fields are the ucs in the x - ca model .",
    "the x - ca model yields distributions of total energy and peak flux which are compatible with the observations .",
    "the ucs in the x - ca form a set which is highly fragmented in space and time , the individual ucs are small scale regions , varying in size , and are short - lived ( see fig .  [ plotone](d ) ) . they do not form in their ensemble a simple large scale structure , but they form a fractal set with fractal dimension roughly @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the individual ucs also do usually not split into smaller ucs , but they trigger new ucs in their neighborhood , so that different chains of ucs travel through the active region , triggering new side - chains of ucs on their way .    following the picture we have from the x - ca model , we consider in this article that the ucs act as nodes of activity ( localized accelerators ) inside a passive 3-d large scale magnetic topology .",
    "the ucs are short lived and appear randomly inside the large scale magnetic topology when specific conditions for instability are met .",
    "the sketch in fig .",
    "[ plottwo ] illustrates the situation .",
    "modeling this dynamic accelerator requires the knowledge of three probability density functions :    \\(1 ) the probability density @xmath25 defines the distances a charged particle travels freely in - between two subsequent encounters with a ucs .",
    "the series of distances @xmath26 , generated by the probability density @xmath25 , characterizes the trajectory of the @xmath27th particle in space .",
    "every particle follows a different characteristic path .",
    "the probability density @xmath25 relates the particle acceleration process to the large scale topology by implicitly representing the effects of the topology ( the magnetic topology itself does not appear explicitly in the model ) .",
    "this aspect was never taken into account in previous acceleration models .",
    "\\(2 ) the probability density @xmath28 provides the effective electric field @xmath29 acting on the @xmath27th particle for the effective time @xmath30 it spends inside the @xmath31th ucs .",
    "particles follow very complicated trajectories inside the ucs .",
    "they may be accelerated by more than one acceleration mechanisms , but what actually is important for our model is the final outcome , i.e.  we characterize a ucs as a simple input - output system , in which an effective dc electric field is acting .",
    "we assume thus that the effective action of a ucs is to increase a particle s momentum by @xmath32 .",
    "\\(3 ) finally , for the third probability , we have two alternative choices : either we give the probability density @xmath33 of the effective times @xmath30 a ucs interacts with a charged particle , or we prescribe the probability density @xmath34 of the effective acceleration lengths @xmath35 , i.e.   the lengths of the trajectories along which the particles are accelerated .",
    "the probabilities @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( either @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) are actually dependent on time , they must be assumed to change in the course of a flare , reflecting the changes in the overall density and connectivity of the ucs  the flaring active region is an evolving network of ucs , whose instantaneous state determines the instantaneous intensity of the flare .",
    "we will though concentrate in our modeling on a short time during a flare , typically one second , so that we can assume the state of the active region not to change significantly , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 can be considered independent of time .",
    "we will show next that the above probabilities define the charged particle dynamics inside the flaring region .",
    "the particle @xmath27 starts with initial momentum @xmath41 from the initial position @xmath42 at time @xmath43 .",
    "the initial momentum @xmath41 is such that the corresponding velocity @xmath44 is drawn at random from the tail of a maxwellian , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the thermal velocity .",
    "the particle is assumed to find itself in the neighborhood of a ucs at time @xmath43 , enters it immediately and undergoes a first acceleration process .    during an interaction with a ucs , the particle s momentum in principle evolves according to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the particle s relativistic momentum ( @xmath49 , with @xmath50 ) ,",
    "@xmath51 is the charge of the particle , and @xmath52 the speed of light . inside the ucs , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are complex functions of time along the particle s complex trajectory .",
    "we thus average  in a loose sense  eq .",
    "( [ dpdt0 ] ) over many internal trajectories in a given ucs , assuming that the corresponding averages exist , @xmath55 @xmath56 is now constant in a given ucs , and assuming that @xmath54 and above all @xmath57 vary wildly in direction , so that @xmath58 is a reasonable assumption , leads to @xmath59 and we have reduced the ucs to a simple constant dc electric field device .",
    "( [ dpdt ] ) is of course a strong simplification of the internal ucs physics , it actually implies that we treat the ucs as black - boxes , concentrating just on the statistical law of how the output is related to the input .",
    "the electric field @xmath60 must consequently be considered as an _ effective _ electric field , which summarizes the complex effects of shock - waves , turbulence , and true dc - electric fields that must be expected to appear in and at a ucs ( see sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] ) .",
    "the effective electric field is constant in a ucs , as mentioned , it is though assumed to vary from ucs to ucs in a stochastic way , as prescribed by the probability density @xmath28 , where @xmath61 stands for the magnitude of the effective electric field @xmath60 .",
    "after all , during the interaction with the @xmath31th ucs , a particle s momentum increases from @xmath62 to @xmath63 according to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is generated by the probability density @xmath28 . to determine @xmath30 , we have two options in the model : in the first case",
    ", we directly generate @xmath30 from the probability density @xmath33 . in the second case ,",
    "the primary random variable is the acceleration length @xmath35 , which is generated by the probability density @xmath34 , and @xmath30 is derived under the assumption that the particle performs a relativistic , one - dimensional motion along the electric field of magnitude @xmath29 and length @xmath35 , with initial momentum the magnitude of the total momentum @xmath66 the particle has before entering the ucs . in this second case",
    "then , the time a particle spends inside a ucs is reduced when the particle s velocity increases .",
    "after the particles has left the ucs , it performs a free flight until it meets again a ucs and undergoes a new acceleration process ( see fig .",
    "[ plottwo ] ) .",
    "the probability density @xmath25 determines the spatial distance @xmath67 the particle travels before it meets this next ucs , situated at @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a unit vector into the direction of the free flight , and @xmath70 is the location of the previous ucs the particle had met .",
    "note that the spatial displacement a particle undergoes inside a ucs is neglected , corresponding to our assumption that the ucs are small scale regions of negligible extent .",
    "we keep track of the time passed during the acceleration process and the free flight , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the time when the particle enters the @xmath73th ucs .",
    "the particle starts a new cycle of acceleration and free flight at this point , the process as a whole is a cyclic one with continued probabilistic jumps in position- and momentum - space . in this article",
    ", we will monitor the system for times which are relatively short , of the order of one second .",
    "for such times , the particles can be assumed to be trapped inside the overall acceleration volume @xmath74 , an assumption which will be confirmed by the results we present below in sec .",
    "we thus do not have to include in the model the loss of particles which leave the active volume .",
    "let us now define the probability densities @xmath75 used in this study .",
    "_ the probability density @xmath25 of jump increments : _ the active , flaring region may be assumed to be in the state of mhd turbulence , embedded in a complex , large scale magnetic topology .",
    "we claim that the ucs , i.e.  the regions of dissipation , are distributed in such a way that they form in their ensemble a fractal set .",
    "this claim is based on two facts : ( i ) flaring active regions have successfully been modeled with self - organized criticality ( soc ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the unstable sites in the soc models represent actually small scale current dissipation regions , i.e. they can be considered as ucs . furthermore , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the regions of dissipation in the soc models at fixed times form a fractal , with fractal dimension roughly @xmath24 .",
    "( ii ) from investigations on hydrodynamic turbulence we know that the eddies in the inertial regime have a scale free , power - law size distribution , making it plausible that at the dissipative scale a fractal set is formed , and indeed , different experiments let us conclude that the dissipative regions form a fractal with dimension around @xmath76 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    the particles in our model",
    "are thus assumed to move from ucs to ucs , the latter being distributed such that they form a fractal set . @xcite",
    "analyzed the kind of random walk where particles move in a volume in which a fractal resides , traveling usually freely but being scattered ( accelerated ) when they encounter a part of the fractal set .",
    "they showed that in this case the distribution of free travel distances @xmath77 in - between two subsequent encounters with the fractal is distributed in good approximation according to @xmath78 as long as @xmath79 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "@xmath81 is decaying exponentially . given that a dimension @xmath82 below two is reported for soc models , as stated above , we are led to assume that @xmath25 is of power - law form , with index between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , preferably near a value of @xmath85 ( with @xmath24 , according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "not included in the study of @xcite are two effects , ( a ) that the particles do not move on straight line paths in - between two subsequent interactions with ucs , but they follow the bent magnetic field lines , and ( b ) that particles can be mirrored and trapped in some regions , making in this way the free travel distances larger .",
    "it is thus reasonable to consider the power - law index of @xmath25 as a free parameter .    after all",
    ", we assume that the freely traveled distances @xmath77 are distributed according to @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are related to the characteristic length of the coronal active region @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is a normalization constant .    _ the probability density @xmath28 of effective electric fields : _ the second probability density determines the effective electric field attached to a specific ucs .",
    "its form should in principle be induced from a respective study , either from observations , which is not feasible , so - far , or from the simulation and modeling of a respective set - up , which to our knowledge seems not to exist , up to date .",
    "we are thus forced to try large classes of distributions .",
    "two cases of distributions are definitely of particular interest , the well - behaved case , where @xmath37 is gaussian , and the ill - behaved case , where @xmath37 is of power - law form .",
    "the gaussian case is well behaved in the sense that all the moments are finite , and it is a reasonable choice because of the central limit theorem , which suggests gaussian distributions if the electric field is the result of the superposition of many uncontrollable , small processes .",
    "the power - law case is ill - behaved in the sense that the moments on from a certain order ( depending on the power - law index ) are infinite .",
    "it represents the case of scale - free processes , as they appear for instance in soc models .",
    "a characteristics of power - law distributions is the importance of the tail , which in fact causes the dominating effects .",

    "while the shape of the spectrum remains qualitatively the same , the steepnesses of the increase at low frequencies and of the decrease at high frequencies quantitatively change , their closeness to power - law shapes varies , and the turn - over frequency and the relative intensity of the o- and x - mode change , if the value of @xmath122 changes .    * on the number problem : * the number problem refers to the question whether an acceleration mechanism is efficient and fast enough to generate the large number of accelerated particles as they are inferred from the observations .",
    "* and references therein ) mention that roughly @xmath218 to @xmath219electrons / sec are accelerated  the number can not be very precise , it is indirectly derived and depends on several assumptions on emission mechanisms and on mostly assumed active region parameters .    in order to check the efficiency of our model ,",
    "we first determine numerically the total energy @xmath220 of the @xmath221 electrons which are in the power - law tail , with @xmath221 now a free parameter , @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the numerically given kinetic energy distribution at @xmath174sec , as yielded by our model , and the tail is defined to start above @xmath172kev ( see sec .",
    "[ sec42 ] and fig .",
    "[ plotfive ] ) . integrating numerically",
    ", we find @xmath224erg .",
    "if we assume a large , but not huge , flare in which say @xmath225erg of energy are released during say @xmath132sec , we find that @xmath226electrons / sec must be accelerated . in a typical coronal active region of volume @xmath227@xmath228 and with particle density @xmath133@xmath134",
    ", there is a total number of @xmath229 particles . during the flare of @xmath132sec duration ,",
    "@xmath4 particles are accelerated in total and potentially leave , corresponding to @xmath230 of the initial particles . with these numbers , it seems that there is no essential deplenishment of the flaring volume , and there is thus no need for a secondary mechanism of replenishment .",
    "we just note that the volume assumed in this estimate is that of the entire active region since the high diffusivity of the particles ( see earlier in this section ) and the nature of soc ( see fig .",
    "[ plotone ] ) let us expect that indeed the entire active region contributes to the acceleration of particles in flares .    doing the same kind of analysis for the ions , with the difference that the power - law tail starts now above @xmath5kev ( see fig .",
    "[ ploteight ] ) , we find a total energy of the accelerated protons @xmath231erg ( in the case of increased acceleration times , see sec .",
    "[ ions ] ) or @xmath232erg ( in the case of increased electric fields ) , which is roughly @xmath233 to @xmath234 times larger than the electron energy in the tail , so that less protons have to be accelerated to account for the observed energies . as a remark",
    ", we note that this result does not imply an imbalance between electron- and proton - acceleration , there may well exist an unobserved , dark population of particles , above all protons at low energies , so that the numbers of accelerated electrons and protons may actually be equal .",
    "the main results and characteristics of our model are : ( 1 ) the acceleration process is extremely fast .",
    "electrons reach mev - energies in @xmath187s , and ions approach @xmath5mev in @xmath0s .",
    "( 2 ) our model exhibits strong super - diffusion of particles in position - space . one important effect of the fast transport of accelerated particles is that they can be expected to reach fast open field - line regions . accelerated particles will thus easily escape into the upper corona and the interplanetary space if closed and open field line regions co - exist inside a large active region .",
    "( 3 ) the energy spectra formed for both species are maxwellians with steep power - law tails .",
    "( 4 ) the hxr spectra are compatible with the observations ( power - law shapes , spectral indices above 2 ) .",
    "( 5 ) the micro - wave spectra are qualitatively compatible with the observations .",
    "( 6 ) we observe efficient , fast plasma heating . energy release , acceleration , and heating are unified , they are the result of the same process .",
    "( 7 ) the results for electrons and ions are quite similar , the ions need though either longer acceleration times or stronger electric fields .",
    "( 8) the total number of accelerated particles is compatible with numbers derived from observations .",
    "( 9 ) electrons and ions reach their maximum energy on a very fast time scale , the system adjusts itself quickly to the conditions imposed by the magnetic structure and the energy release process ( in the model through the modification of the chosen probabilities @xmath25 , @xmath28 , @xmath235 , see sec .  [ sec31 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the acceleration would follow the evolution of @xmath236 and @xmath237 very closely , it instantaneously adjusts itself to the instantaneous coronal conditions .",
    "we have shown that radiative losses due to synchrotron radiation are negligible for the particle dynamics , due to the energies and the densities considered here , but in general they have to be incorporated in the evolution of particles , especially if this process is applied to astrophysical sources .",
    "not included in our study are the collisional losses of the particles during their free travels .",
    "they possibly would affect mainly the particles with low velocities , a fraction of the particles might be thermalized during their free flights . also not included are the radiation associated with collisions , the possible thin target hxr emission of the system , and the escape of particles , i.e.  the diffusive loss of particles out of the active region .",
    "it is also to be mentioned that in the random walk approach we made here , the spatial evolution of the particles is treated in a simplified way , we have included the magnetic topology only implicitly through the distribution @xmath25 of spatial jumps .",
    "an explicitly included topology would cause effects like escape , mirroring , trapping , which might affect the timing and the spatial structure of a flare to some degree ( e.g.  loop - tops , loop - top with a helmet , foot - points , etc . ) .",
    "in this article , we shifted the emphasis of the acceleration process in active regions away from the details of specific mechanism(s ) involved and focused on the global aspects of the active region , its evolution in space and time , and on the stochastic nature of the acceleration process .",
    "our basic assumptions are : ( 1 ) acceleration is a local process in and near the ucs , ( 2 ) the ucs are distributed in a complex way inside the large - scale 3-d magnetic topology of the active region , and ( 3 ) acceleration is the result of multiple interactions with different ucs .",
    "these assumptions can be summarized in the statement that energy dissipation and particle acceleration in flares are fragmented .",
    "we achieved for the first time to connect the accelerator to the 3-d magnetic topology and the energy release process . from our results",
    ", we can safely conclude that the complexity of the 3-d magnetic field topology in active regions , in combination with the stresses imposed by the convection zone onto it , forms a highly efficient accelerator .",
    "the adequate tool for modeling the stochastic nature of particle acceleration in flares is continuous time random walk in position- and velocity - space .",
    "this new approach opens up the way for the understanding of a variety of acceleration phenomena , e.g.  acceleration before and after a flare , acceleration without a flare , long lasting acceleration etc .",
    "we feel that the road opened in this article is new and still unexplored in astrophysics .",
    "as mentioned , it can provide answers to a number of open problems which have remained unsolved when it was attempted to use one ucs ( above or inside a flaring loop ) and one ( uncorrelated with the energy release ) acceleration mechanism to explain phenomena of acceleration .",
    "many new questions are still open and we plan to return to these issues in a forth - coming article ."
