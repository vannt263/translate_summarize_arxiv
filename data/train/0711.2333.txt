    "understanding the formation of galaxies is one of the most intriguing and unanswered problems in astronomy today . studying galaxies in the distant universe is one of the major approaches for deciphering their formation and evolution .",
    "traditionally , distant galaxies are examined in terms of their gross properties , such as luminosities ( e.g. , faber et al . 2007 ) , colours ( e.g. , moustakas et al .",
    "2004 ) , and sizes ( trujillo et al . 2007 ) , and stellar masses ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "2005 ; conselice et al . 2007a , b ) .",
    "the least developed approached , but potentially one of the most exciting for revealing unique information , is how the structures and morphologies of galaxies change through cosmic time .",
    "the reason a structural and morphological approach is potentially the most fruitful for understanding galaxy formation and evolution is that the structures of galaxies correlate with formation modes , such as star formation and galaxy mergers ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "it is thus possible to determine the physical processes behind galaxy formation directly without having to compare observables with physical models .",
    "this direct approach has been used in the past to calculate the role of galaxy mergers in the formation of massive galaxies ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; lotz et al .",
    "2006 ; conselice 2006 ) .",
    "this previous work showed that the most massive galaxies with m@xmath3 appear to form nearly all their stellar mass in mergers , which occur mostly , and in large numbers , at @xmath7 .",
    "there are however still many outstanding problems with using galaxy structure to derive evolution , including the reliability of the approaches used , and the uniqueness and repeatability of results thus far obtained . for the most part , it is necessary to use deep hubble space telescope imaging to measure the structures and morphologies of a large number of distant galaxies , although adaptive optics , particularly in the near - infrared , is becoming another powerful approach ( e.g. , wright et al .",
    "since the imaging cameras on the hubble space telescope are limited in field of view , only a small fraction of distant galaxies have been studied thus far ( e.g. , williams et al .",
    "1996 ; giavalisco et al . 2004 ) .",
    "particularly , most of the merger history of galaxies at @xmath6 has been measured within the hubble deep field - north , which currently has the only high resolution deep near - infrared imaging of distant galaxies ( e.g. , dickinson et al . 2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; papovich et al .",
    "thus , it is important to study the structures and morphologies of galaxies in as many fields as possible , using different techniques .",
    "the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) represents perhaps our best opportunity to study the most distant galaxies at observed optical wavelengths for the foreseeable future .",
    "the udf is a major hubble imaging program utilising the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) to image a single pointing in the sky to the deepest depth ever probed in the optical .",
    "as the acs udf images are very deep , and have a higher resolution than the wfpc2 hdfs , we can address some fundamental questions concerning galaxy structure and morphology .",
    "these include : understanding the nature of galaxy morphologies seen in deep optical surveys ; the agreement , or lack thereof , between apparent morphology and structural parameters ; and the evolution of galaxy structure through time .",
    "we are particularly interested in determine how major galaxy mergers are driving the formation of the galaxy population at early times .",
    "our major finding in this paper is that galaxies in the past are significantly more irregular , peculiar , asymmetric , and clumpy than galaxies today , and that this likely results from the past merger and assembly activity that established these systems .",
    "we show that a large fraction of this irregularity can not be produced simply by star formation , and derive the merger fraction and rate for galaxies of various stellar masses .",
    "we confirm the findings of conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and conselice ( 2006 ) that massive galaxies with m@xmath3 have a steeply increasing merger fraction , which evolves as @xmath8 @xmath9 between @xmath10 and 3 .",
    "this suggests that these massive galaxies undergo on average 4.3@xmath11 major mergers between @xmath1 to 0 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows :  2 includes a discussion of the data sources we use in this paper ,  3 is a description of our morphological and structural analyses , and the stellar masses we utilise ,  4 is a discussion of our results , including how different structural analysis techniques compare with each other , especially how merger finding methods differ ,  5 gives our description of the merger history up to @xmath1 , and  6 is our summary and conclusions .",
    "we use a standard cosmology of h@xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , and @xmath14 = 0.3 throughout .",
    "the primary data source used in this paper are the acs and nicmos imaging of the hubble ultra deep field ( thompson et al . 2005 ; beckwith et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the field of view of the acs image is 11 arcmin@xmath15 , and is located within the goods - south field ( giavalisco et al .",
    "the udf acs images use the same filter set as the goods data , which are the f435w ( b@xmath16 ) , f606w ( v@xmath17 ) , f775w ( @xmath18 ) , and f850l ( @xmath19 ) bands .",
    "the central wavelengths of these filters , and their full - width at half - maximum are : f435w ( 4297@xmath20  ) , f606w ( 5907@xmath21  ) , f775w ( 7764@xmath22  ) , f850l ( 9445@xmath23  ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude for point sources is m@xmath24 within these images , making the udf easily the deepest optical imaging taken to date .",
    "the photometry and photometric redshifts we use are taken from coe et al .",
    "coe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measure the photometry of galaxies in the udf within the udf bv@xmath25jh bands with great care .",
    "the galaxies are detected with a modified version of sextractor , called sexseg .",
    "the photometry is psf - corrected and aperture matched , removing the problem of matching magnitudes at different wavelengths due to variations in the psf .",
    "the @xmath26 data was furthermore corrected for psf halo effects , and a correction was made to the nicmos photometric zero point ( coe et al .",
    "this high fidelity photometry is then used for deriving photometric redshifts , and for the stellar masses we measure for our galaxy sample .",
    "the coe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) photometric redshifts are measured using the photometric redshift techniques from benitez ( 2000 ) , based on the optical and nir photometry from acs and nicmos .",
    "in addition to these photometric redshifts we utilise 56 spectroscopic redshifts taken to date within the udf field within our selection limits .",
    "we limit our analysis of the udf galaxies to the relatively brighter systems , although we are able to probe in the udf down to a fainter magnitude than any other field .",
    "faint galaxies are difficult to study structurally , as they are often too small , and have too low a surface brightness for reliable measurements .",
    "we thus limit the magnitude of our study to @xmath2 , such that we are not biased by low signal to noise imaging .",
    "we furthermore use the coe et al.(2006 ) udf image versions with their accompanying segmentation map from sextractor , and weight map , which we utilize later in our structural analysis (  3 ) .",
    "the final catalogue of @xmath2 sources we study in this paper contains 1052 unique galaxies .",
    "as described in the introduction , the structures and morphologies of galaxies is quickly becoming recognised as one of the most important methods for understanding galaxies ( e.g. , conselice 2003a , b ; cassata et al .",
    "2005 ; grogin et al . 2005 ; trujillo et al . 2007 ) . as such",
    ", we study the morphological properties of all @xmath2 galaxies in the udf in some detail .",
    "it is important however to realise what we can , and can not , study within the udf .",
    "although the udf is the deepest image ever taken , it is unfortunately not very large , with a total area of 11 arcmin@xmath15 .",
    "this does not give a large enough co - moving volume to study galaxies in large detail at any redshift .",
    "it does allow us to probe structures and morphologies in greater detail than in any other field , although general results on galaxy evolution obtained from it are limited .",
    "to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]    we carry out our analysis in several steps to maximise the usefulness of the data , and to minimise problems from contamination .",
    "we first create ` postage stamp ' images of each of our sample galaxies .",
    "these are created by cutting out a 10  @xmath27 10  box of the udf surrounding each galaxy , based on positions from the sextractor catalog detections from coe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . before this",
    "is done , the udf acs image is cleaned of nearby galaxies and stars through the use of the so - called ` segmentation map ' produced by the sexseg (  2 , coe et al .",
    "the segmentation maps are created through the sextractor procedure used by coe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for detecting galaxies within the udf .",
    "these segmentation maps are equivalent in size to the udf image itself , with the difference being that it gives a numerical value for each pixel that reveals which galaxy it belongs to .",
    "these segmentation maps are used for photometry , but they are also useful for removing nearby galaxies .",
    "the procedure we use is to replace pixels of galaxies not being studied to the sky background with proper noise characteristics included .",
    "we then use these cleaned cutout images in our analysis .    after examining our sample by eye",
    ", we found that occasionally features remained near galaxies , and had to be manually removed by hand .",
    "there were also cases where large late - type galaxies with spiral arms brighter than their centres tended to be picked up by the program more than once , and these were manually noted when spotted . in the following sections we describe our visual and quantitative analysis of these galaxy images within the udf .",
    "we study the structures and morphologies of our sample using two broadly different methods .",
    "the first is a simple visual estimate of morphologies based on the appearance of our galaxies in the acs imaging .",
    "the outline of our classification process is given in conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , and conselice et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "we place each udf galaxy into one of nine categories : compact , elliptical , distorted elliptical , lenticular ( s0 ) , early - type disk , late - type disk , edge - on disk , merger / peculiar , and unknown / too - faint .",
    "our classifications are based only on appearance .",
    "information such as colour , size , redshift , etc are not used to determine these types .",
    "we carry out these classifications to link our results with lower redshifts , as well as for having some basis for understanding the morphological distribution of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "a short explanation of these types is provided below , with the number we find in each class listed at the end of each description .    1",
    ".   ellipticals : ellipticals ( es ) are centrally concentrated galaxies with no evidence for lower surface brightness , outer structures .",
    "we have 128 of these galaxies in our sample .",
    "peculiar - ellipticals : peculiar ellipticals ( pec - es ) are galaxies that appear elliptical , but have some minor morphological peculiarity , such as offset isophotes , dual nuclei , or low - surface brightness asymmetries in their outer parts ( 65 systems ) .",
    "s0s : s0s are galaxies that appear to have a smooth disk with a bulge .",
    "these galaxies do not appear to have much star formation , and are selected in the same way nearby s0s are .",
    "our sample has a total of three s0s , making its contribution very small .",
    "compact - a galaxy is classified as compact if its structure is resolved , but still appears compact without any substructure .",
    "it is similar to the elliptical classification in that a system must appear very smooth and symmetric .",
    "a compact galaxy differs from an elliptical in that it contains no obvious features such as an extended light distribution or a light envelope .",
    "( 153 systems ) 5 .",
    "early - type disks : if a galaxy contains a central concentration with some evidence for lower surface brightness outer light in the form of spiral arms or a disk , it is classified as an early - type disk .",
    "( 28 systems ) 6 .",
    "late - type disks : late - type disks are galaxies that appear to have more outer low surface brightness disk light than inner concentrated light .",
    "( 5 systems ) 7 .   edge - on disks : disk systems seen edge - on , and whose face - on morphology can not be determined , but is presumably an s0 or spiral .",
    "( 32 systems ) 8 .",
    "peculiar / irregular : peculiars and irregulars are systems that appear to be disturbed , or peculiar looking , including elongated / tailed sources .",
    "these galaxies are possibly in some phase of a merger ( conselice et al .",
    "2003a ) , or are dominated by star formation ( 502 systems ) .",
    "unknown / too - faint : if a galaxy is too faint for any reliable classification it was placed in this category . often these galaxies appear as smudges without any structure .",
    "these could be disks or ellipticals , but their extreme faintness precludes a reliable classification .",
    "( 77 systems )      to 120 mm    .",
    "labelled are disks , ellipticals / s0s , compact galaxies , and peculiars .",
    "note that the compact galaxies become an important population at higher redshifts.,width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    we use the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) parameters to probe the structures of our galaxies quantitatively .",
    "the cas parameters are a non - parametric method for measuring the forms of galaxies on resolved ccd images ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2002 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the basic idea is that galaxies have light distributions that reveal their past and present formation modes ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , well - known galaxy types in the nearby universe fall in well defined regions of the cas parameter space . for example",
    ", the selection @xmath28 locates systems which are nearly all major galaxy mergers in the nearby universe ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000b ; conselice 2003 ; hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2005 ; conselice 2006b ) .",
    "in addition to the classic cas parameters , we also investigate the use of the similar gini and m@xmath29 parameters ( lotz et al .",
    "2006 ) for understanding the morphologies of the udf galaxies .",
    "we give a brief description of these parameters below .",
    "the way we measure structural parameters on the udf image varies slightly from what has been done earlier in the hubble deep field , and goods imaging ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; conselice et al .",
    "2004 ) . the basic procedure , after cutting out the galaxy into a smaller image , is to first measure the radius in which the parameters are computed .",
    "the radius we use for all our indices is the petrosian radii , which is the radius defined as the location where the surface brightness at a given radius is 20% of the surface brightness within that radius ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "we use circular apertures for our petrosian radii and quantitative parameter estimation .",
    "we begin our estimates of the galaxy centre for the radius measurement at the centroid of the galaxy s light distribution . through modelling and various tests",
    ", it can be shown that the resulting radii do not depending critically on the exact centre , although the cas and other parameters do ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ; lotz et al .",
    "the exact petrosian radius we use to measure our parameters is    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the radius where the surface brightness is 20% of the surface brightness within that radius .",
    "a very important issue , especially for the faint galaxies seen in the udf , is how to account for background light and noise . for faint galaxies",
    "there is a considerable amount of noise added due to the sky , which must be corrected . through various test ,",
    "outlined in detail in conselice et al .",
    "( 2008 , in prep ) , we conclude that the proper way to correct parameters for the background requires that the selected background area be close to the object of interest .",
    "this is only an issue for faint galaxies , and for galaxies imaged on large mosaics which have a non - uniform weight map , and whose noise characteristics vary across the field . by using a background near each object",
    "we alleviate these issues as the noise properties do not vary significantly over @xmath32 arcmin , where the galaxy and the background area are selected .",
    "we review below how the cas and gini/20 parameters are measured . for more detail",
    "see bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , conselice et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , conselice ( 2003 ) and lotz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the asymmetry of a galaxy is measured by taking an original galaxy image and rotating it 180 degrees about the galaxy centre , and then subtracting the two images ( conselice 1997 ) .",
    "there are corrections done for background , and radius ( explained in detail in conselice et al .",
    "most importantly , the centre for rotation is decided by an iterative process which finds the location of the minimum asymmetry .",
    "the formula for calculating the asymmetry is given by :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the original image pixels , @xmath35 is the image after rotating by 180 .",
    "the background subtraction using light from a blank sky area , called @xmath36 , are critical for this process , and must be minimised in the same way as the original galaxy itself .",
    "a lower value of @xmath37 means that a galaxy has a higher degree of rotational symmetry which tends to be found in elliptical galaxies .",
    "higher values of @xmath37 indicate an asymmetric light distribution , which are usually found in spiral galaxies , or in the more extreme case , merger candidates .",
    "the upper and lower bound for @xmath37 , in this study are 1.18 and @xmath38 .",
    "the mean @xmath37 value is 0.26 .",
    "concentration is a measure of the intensity of light contained within a central region in comparison to a larger region in the outer - parts of a galaxy .",
    "the exact definition is the ratio of two circular radii which contain 20% and 80% ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) of the total galaxy flux ,    @xmath41    this index is sometimes called c@xmath42 .",
    "a higher value of @xmath43 indicates that a larger amount of light in a galaxy is contained within a central region .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of @xmath43 for our galaxy sample are @xmath44 , with a mean of @xmath45 .",
    "this particular measurement of the concentration correlates well with the mass and halo properties of galaxies ( e.g. , bershady et al . 2000 ; conselice 2003 ; courteau et al .",
    "2007 ) .",

    "the vertical line denote the redshift ranges we use to divide our sample into various redshift cuts.,width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]      the clumpiness ( sometimes called smoothness ) @xmath47 is a parameter used to describe the fraction of light in a galaxy which is contained in clumpy light concentrations .",
    "clumpy galaxies have a relatively large amount of light at high spatial frequencies , whereas smooth systems , such as elliptical galaxies contain light at low spatial frequencies .",
    "galaxies which are undergoing star formation tend to have very clumpy structures , and high @xmath47 values .",
    "clumpiness can be measured in a number of ways , the most common method used , as described in conselice ( 2003 ) is ,    @xmath48,\\ ] ]    where , the original image @xmath49 is blurred to produce a secondary image , @xmath50 . this blurred image",
    "is then subtracted from the original image leaving a residual map , containing only high frequency structures in the galaxy ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "to quantify this , we normalise the summation of these residuals by the original galaxy s total light , and subtract from this the residual amount of sky after smoothing and subtracting it in the same way .",
    "the size of the smoothing kernel @xmath51 is determined by the radius of the galaxy , and is @xmath52 ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "note that the centres of galaxies are removed when this procedure is carried out .",
    "the gini coefficient is a statistical tool originally used in economics to determine the distribution of wealth within a population , with higher values indicating a very unequal distribution ( gini of 1 would mean all wealth / light is in one person / pixel ) , wile a lower value indicates it is distributed more evenly amongst the population ( gini of 0 would mean everyone / every pixel has an equal share ) .",
    "the value of g is defined by the lorentz curve of the galaxy s light distribution , which does not take into consideration spatial position .",
    "each pixel is ordered by its brightness and counted as part of the cumulative distribution ( see lotz et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "the mean value of gini in our udf catalogue is 0.71 .",
    "the 20 parameter is a similar parameter to the concentration in that it gives a value that indicates whether light is concentrated within an image ; it is however calculated slightly differently .",
    "the total moment of light is calculated by summing the flux of each pixel multiplied by the square of its distance from the centre .",
    "the centre is deemed to be the location where 20 is minimised ( lotz et al 2004 ) .",
    "the value of 20 is the moment of the fluxes of the brightest 20% of light in a galaxy , which is then normalised by the total light moment for all pixels ( lotz et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 )    to 150 mm        [ sample - figure ]    the main differences between 20 and @xmath43 are due to the moments in 20 which depend on the distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "the value of 20 will therefore be more affected by spatial variations , and also the centre of the galaxy is again a free parameter .",
    "this can make it more sensitive to possible mergers . in our study",
    "we find that the upper and lower bounds of 20 are 20 @xmath53 to 20 @xmath54 , with a mean of 20 @xmath55 .",
    "we apply a revised cas system to our udf galaxy sample to determine their structural parameters .",
    "there are several caveats to using the acs imaging to measure these parameters .",
    "the first is that there are morphological @xmath56correction and surface brightness dimming effects which will change the measured parameters , such that the asymmetry and clumpiness indices will decrease ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; conselice 2003 ) , and the concentration index will be less reliable ( conselice 2003 ) . there is also the issue that for systems at @xmath57 we are viewing these galaxies in their rest - frame ultraviolet using acs data , which means that there are complications when comparing their measured structures with the calibrated rest - frame optical indices for nearby galaxies .",
    "we deal with the first problem in  4.2 and discuss the reliability of the measurements themselves below .    to test the reliability of our parameters , we plot all five indices against apparent magnitude to our @xmath58 magnitude limit .",
    "we find that there is no dependence on magnitude for the morphological parameters within this limit . at magnitudes fainter than our limit",
    "we find that all of our structural parameters become systematically smaller or higher , simply just due to a lower signal to noise .",
    "our limit of @xmath2 ensures that we are within the regime where systematic problems are not dominating our signal .",
    ".the change in cas and gini/20 parameters from the rest - frame optical to near - uv as function of redshift .",
    "these values are defined such that @xmath59 [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     first , it is important to note that the merger fraction we measure is in no sense the total galaxy merger fraction .",
    "all merger fractions we derive are computed using a certain technique , in this case the cas parameters , and this technique is only sensitive to a well defined time - range . in the case of cas mergers , this time - span is roughly 0.4 gyr ( conselice 2006 ) . as determine in conselice ( 2006 )",
    "there are phases of a merger which will not be picked up by the cas technique .",
    "a different technique will find a different merger fraction if it has a time sensitivity different from the cas system .",
    "for example galaxy pair methods have roughly a factor of two different time - scale for a merger than the cas system ( de propris et al .",
    "2007 ) , but gives the same merger rate .",
    "we therefore expect galaxies that by eye appear as a merger , but will not have a high asymmetry .",
    "there are a few ways to fit the merger fraction .",
    "the first is the traditional power - law format ( patton et al .",
    "2002 ; conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; bridge et al .",
    "this fitting format is given by ,    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the merger fraction at a given redshift , @xmath62 is the merger fraction at @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the power - law index for characterising the merger fraction evolution .",
    "another way to characterise the merger fraction evolution which dates back to theoretical arguments based on press - schechter formalism for merging ( carlberg 1990 ) is a combined power - law exponential evolution .",
    "this form appears to be a better fit to all of the redshift data than a simple power - law ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "the formula for this evolution is given by :    @xmath65    where the @xmath63 merger fraction is given by @xmath66 exp(@xmath67 ) .",
    "we plot in figure  14 the merger fraction for the sample of galaxies in the udf as well as the hdf - n , where there is nicmos high - resolution imaging of galaxies , and thus the merger fraction can be measure strictly in the rest - frame optical at all redshifts .",
    "the results derived within both fields are however very similar .",
    "we show the combined hdf - n and udf merger fractions as the green crosses on figure  14 .",
    "the merger fractions for the udf are always measured in the observed @xmath26-band .",
    "we however correct for both the effects of redshift , as well as for the morphological @xmath56correction using the rest - frame b - band asymmetry calculated using equation ( 7 ) .",
    "we show as the solid line on figure  14 the best fit values for the merger fraction using the combined exponential / power - law fitting formula ( eq .",
    "we also fit up to the merger fraction redshift peak the power - law form given by equation ( 8) for all but the @xmath68 m@xmath69 galaxies where there are too few points to carry out a reliable fit .",
    "the values found for the m@xmath3 galaxies are : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for the exponential / power - law formalism .",
    "the lower mass systems have a systematically higher value of @xmath73 , a lower value of @xmath64 , and a larger ( less negative ) value of @xmath67 .",
    "the peak merger fraction within the exponential / power - law fit occurs at a redshift of @xmath74 . using our fits",
    ", we calculate that the peak in the merger fraction occurs at redshifts @xmath75 for galaxies with m@xmath3 , and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 for galaxies with @xmath68 m@xmath69 and @xmath68 m@xmath69 selected galaxies , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the peak merger fraction appears to occur later for lower - mass galaxies .",
    "the downsizing for the lower - mass galaxies therefore might occur because these systems are not merging as quickly as the higher mass galaxies .        by using the number densities for galaxies within our mass ranges from previous work , and the time - scales from our cas method",
    ", we can calculate the merger rate for our m@xmath3 galaxy samples .",
    "the number densities for our systems are taken from drory et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and the time - scales for merging are derived from equation 10 in conselice ( 2006 ) , based on n - body models analysed using cas indices .    the galaxy merger rate for our systems can be calculated through the merger rate equation ,    @xmath78    where n@xmath79 is the number densities of galaxies within a given stellar mass range , and f@xmath79 is the galaxy merger fraction .",
    "note that this is not the merger fraction , which is the number of mergers divided by the number of galaxies , which is roughly half the galaxy merger fraction ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "we convert our merger fractions used earlier in this paper to galaxy merger fractions using the relation ,    @xmath80    the time - scales we use in eq .",
    "( 10 ) ( @xmath81 ) come from the calculations based on n - body models in conselice ( 2006 ) .",
    "there is a slight decrease in the time - scale for galaxies with lower masses .",
    "we utilise these results to calculate that the merger time - scale for the most massive galaxies with m@xmath3 is @xmath82 gyr , and slightly lower , between 0.27 - 0.29 gyr for the lower mass systems .    by utilising the number densities for galaxies of a given stellar mass from drory et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the time - scales from conselice ( 2006 ) , and the galaxy merger fractions from this paper , we compute the merger rate as a function of stellar mass using equation ( 10 ) .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in figure  15 .",
    "as can be seen , the merger rate decreases at lower redshifts for galaxies at masses @xmath68 m@xmath83 @xmath68 , with the average merger rate , @xmath84 @xmath85 galaxies merging gyr@xmath13 gpc@xmath86 .",
    "the more massive galaxies with m@xmath3 have a lower merger rate at all redshifts , and a more steeply declining merger rate with time .",
    "we find that the merger rate declines as @xmath87 for these massive galaxies , which is similar to the decline in the merger fraction .",
    "the merger rate for @xmath68 m@xmath83 @xmath68 galaxies evolves as @xmath88 , again similar to the evolution in the merger fraction , and showing a more gradual decline with time compared to more massive galaxies .",
    "the steeper decline in the merger rate for more massive galaxies is likely partially the reason the star formation rate in these systems also drops much faster than for lower mass systems ( conselice et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "one of the major benefits to calculating the merger rate is that it allows us to determine the total number of major mergers a galaxy of a given mass will undergo between two redshifts .",
    "we calculate the total number of major mergers a galaxy with m@xmath3 undergoes from @xmath1 to @xmath89 using equation ( 11 ) in conselice ( 2006 ) .",
    "we use our fitted exponential / power - law functions for this calculation , which has an associated uncertainty associated with with the fit .",
    "figure  16 shows the cumulative number of mergers which have occurred from @xmath1 to @xmath89 as a function of mass . although we do not have a good idea of the merger fraction or rate for our massive galaxies at @xmath90 , we know from previous work that the merger fractions for these systems is very low , particularly for the most massive galaxies ( e.g. , patton et al .",
    "2002 ; de propris et al . 2007 ;",
    "conselice et al .",
    "using our merger fraction fits , we calculate that the average number of mergers a galaxy with m@xmath3 will undergo from @xmath1 to 0 is n@xmath91 .",
    "this is nearly the same as the value we obtained by using the hdf - n , where for the same mass range , we found n@xmath92 ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in this calculation are dominated by those from the merger - time scale calculation .",
    "the lower mass galaxies generally have a lower total number of major mergers occurring at @xmath5 ( figure  16 ) .",
    "this is perhaps partially because we can not measure the merger fraction for these lower mass galaxies reliably at @xmath93 .",
    "the volume probed by the udf is not large enough to reliably trace this merger fraction , and other fields which are large enough , are not deep enough . in general",
    "however , it appears that the lower mass galaxies do not undergo the same number of major mergers as the highest mass galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it appears , as we discussed in conselice ( 2006 ) , that most of the major mergers for the most massive galaxies occurs at higher redshifts , @xmath6 , although for the lower mass galaxies there is still some merging at these later times .",
    "this is consistent with the downsizing of star formation ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "2006 ) produced through merging , and the fact that peculiar galaxies found at lower redshifts often contain a lower stellar mass ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "this paper begins a series in which we examine the structures of distant galaxies , and determine the likely role of galaxy merging in the formation of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we examine structural parameters using the cas and gini/20 system on galaxies found within the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) .",
    "we also examine the stellar masses and eye - ball estimates of morphological types for these systems .",
    "our major conclusions and findings include :      \\ii .",
    "we compare how visual estimates of morphology agree with positions in cas and gini/20 space .",
    "we find a generally good agreement between these methods with the merger region in cas space nearly totally occupied by galaxies which are visually classified as peculiars / mergers .",
    "we examine the merger fraction of galaxies in the udf using the cas system and compare with our previous results of the merger fraction and rate derived using the hubble deep field .",
    "we confirm our earlier measurements of the merger history , including the fact that the highest mass galaxies with m@xmath3 have a steeply increasing merger fraction up to @xmath1 .",
    "this increase can be fit as a power - law @xmath94 , with @xmath95 for the combined udf and hdf - n sample .",
    "we find that the merger fraction for lower mass galaxies are lower at high redshift , but reach their peak fractions at lower redshifts . in total",
    "we find that m@xmath3 galaxies undergo on average 4.3@xmath11 major mergers at @xmath96 , with most of this merging occurring at @xmath6 .",
