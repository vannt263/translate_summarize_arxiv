    "recently , @xcite reported on a new class of luminous compact galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 = 0.112  0.360 , discovered by the galaxy zoo project from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images .",
    "the galaxy zoo project collected simple morphological classifications of nearly 900 000 galaxies drawn from the sdss , contributed by hundreds of thousands of volunteers @xcite . in particular , the attention was drawn on compact objects named `` green pea '' galaxies .",
    "their appearance is mainly caused by the very strong [ o iii ] @xmath125007   optical emission line , with an unusually large equivalent width of up to @xmath1 1000  , redshifting into the sdss @xmath13 band , resulting in a green color in the @xmath14 composite sdss images ( green being the color represented by the @xmath13 band in these composite images ) .",
    "@xcite discussed a well - defined sample of 251 color - selected objects located mainly in low - density regions .",
    "they found that the median environmental density around the green pea galaxies is less than two - thirds of that around normal galaxies .",
    "most of the green pea galaxies are strongly star - forming , although there are some active galactic nuclei interlopers , including eight newly discovered narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies . for a further spectroscopic analysis , @xcite selected a subsample of 80 star - forming galaxies and found that they are low - mass galaxies ( @xmath15 @xmath1 10@xmath16  10@xmath17 @xmath4 ) , with high star formation rates ( @xmath1 10 @xmath4 yr@xmath9 ) and solar metallicities , if the solar calibration of @xcite , 12 + log ( o / h)@xmath18 = 8.7 , is adopted .",
    "@xcite found that green pea galaxies have some of the highest specific star formation rates seen in the local universe ( up to 10@xmath19 m@xmath18 yr@xmath9 ) , and are similar in size , mass , luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies .",
    "they are also similar to high - redshift ultraviolet - luminous galaxies ( lyman - break galaxies and ly-@xmath20 emitters ) .",
    "those authors suggested that the green pea galaxies may be the last remnants of a mode of star formation common in the early universe , and therefore provide an excellent local laboratory for studying the extreme star formation processes that occur in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "later , @xcite investigated the oxygen and nitrogen chemical abundances in the green pea galaxies of @xcite .",
    "they found these systems to be genuine metal - poor galaxies , with mean oxygen abundances 12 + log o / h @xmath18.0 , or 0.2 solar .",
    "while the n / o ratios of green pea galaxies follow the relation with stellar mass of local star - forming galaxies , @xcite find that the green pea mass - metallicity relation is offset by @xmath1 0.3 dex to lower metallicities .",
    "they argue that recent interaction - induced inflow of gas , possibly coupled with a selective metal - rich gas loss , driven by supernova winds , may explain their findings .",
    "interaction - induced infall of gas would also be consistent with the known galaxy properties such as high specific star formation rates , extreme compactness , and disturbed optical morphologies .",
    "@xcite concluded that the green pea galaxy properties seem to be not common in the nearby universe , suggesting that the green pea phase is a short and extreme stage of their evolution .",
    "they agreed with @xcite that these galaxies may allow to study in great detail many processes , such as starburst activity and chemical enrichment , under physical conditions approaching those in galaxies at higher redshifts .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to further the studies of green pea galaxies and reexamine the above conclusions of @xcite and @xcite by studying a considerably larger sample of luminous compact emission - line galaxies selected from the data release 7 ( dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "we adopt an entirely different approach in the selection of our galaxy sample .",
    "in contrast to the study of @xcite , our luminous compact galaxies are selected using spectroscopic criteria which are supplemented by morphological criteria .",
    "the selection criteria of our galaxies are described in section 2 .",
    "their element abundances are derived in section 3 .",
    "the luminosity - metallicity relation for the sample galaxies is discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we describe a technique for galaxy stellar mass determination , taking into account the gaseous continuum emission .",
    "we derive stellar masses for the young and old stellar populations in each galaxy . in section 6",
    "we compare the physical properties of starbursts in luminous compact galaxies .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation for the sample galaxies is derived in section 7 . in sections 8 and 9 ,",
    "we examine respectively their star formation rates and the age of their stellar populations .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 10 .",
    "the photometric selection criteria used by @xcite , based on the green appearance of a galaxy in the sdss images , pick out galaxies in a relatively narrow range of redshifts , @xmath0 @xmath1 0.1  0.3 : those redshifts are such as to make the strong h@xmath5 , [ o iii ] @xmath124959  and [ o iii ] @xmath125007  optical emission lines fall in the sdss @xmath13 band .",
    "such an approach fails to find galaxies with similar properties at lower and higher redshifts because their colors would then not be green .    to avoid this restriction ,",
    "we adopt here a different approach .",
    "we select luminous compact emission - line galaxies ( lcgs ) by using criteria that are based on both spectra and images in the sdss dr7 .",
    "these criteria are as follows :    \\1 ) the extinction - corrected luminosity of the h@xmath5 emission line is greater than @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) = 3@xmath710@xmath22 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "the extinction coefficient is derived from the observed balmer decrement in the sdss spectra .",
    "\\2 ) the equivalent width of the h@xmath5 emission line is high , ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath2 50  .",
    "this criterion helps to select only objects with strong emission lines in their spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and thus containing young starbursts with ages 3 - 5 myr .",
    "we note that most of the green pea galaxies from @xcite have ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath2 100  .",
    "thus , our sample of lcgs covers a larger range of ew(h@xmath5 ) .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we do not use the equivalent width of the [ o iii ] @xmath125007 emission line as a selection criterion .",
    "this is because the strength of the [ o iii ] @xmath125007 emission line in young starbursts is metallicity - dependent .",
    "it is strongest at 12+logo / h @xmath1 8.0 , decreasing at both higher and lower o abundances .",
    "therefore , using the strength the [ o iii ] @xmath125007 emission line as a selection criterion would unduly bias the sample toward galaxies with a narrow range of o abundances near 12+logo / h @xmath1 8.0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of the h@xmath5 emission line allows us to pick out galaxies with a considerably larger range of o abundances .",
    "\\3 ) only galaxies with a well - detected [ o iii ] @xmath124363   emission line in their spectra , with a flux error less than 50% of the line flux , are selected .",
    "this criterion allows an accurate abundance determination using the direct method , in contrast to @xcite who used the less accurate empirical strong - line method for abundance determination . if we do not impose criterion 3 , but only criteria 1 and 2 , then the number of selected galaxies would increase only by @xmath120% . thus ,",
    "when criterion 3 is imposed , the decrease in the number of galaxies is small enough so as not to introduce large biases in the physical properties of the selected sample . on the other hand ,",
    "the benefit of being able to determine accurate o abundances and study trends with metallicity is inestimable .",
    "\\4 ) galaxies with obvious evidence of seyfert 2 spectral features , such as strong [ ne v ] @xmath123426 , he ii @xmath124686 , [ o i ] @xmath126300 , and [ s ii ] @xmath126717 , @xmath126731 emission lines are excluded .",
    "thus , we select only star - forming galaxies .",
    "\\5 ) on their sdss images , galaxies are nearly compact at low redshifts , and unresolved at high redshifts .    using these criteria",
    ", we constructed 4 subsamples of lcgs : 1 ) subsample 1 includes 161 galaxies with ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 100  and a round shape , without evident signs of disturbed morphology .",
    "thus , this subsample should be most similar in properties to the star - forming green pea galaxy sample of @xcite ; 2 ) subsample 2 consists of 159 galaxies with ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 100  and with some sign of disturbed morphology suggesting interaction and the presence of more than one star - forming region ; 3 ) subsample 3 is the same as subsample 1 , but it consists of 116 galaxies with a lower ew(h@xmath5 ) , covering the range 100  @xmath23 ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 50 ; and 4 ) subsample 4 is the same as subsample 2 , but it consists of 367 galaxies with a lower ew(h@xmath5 ) , 100  @xmath23 ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 50 .",
    "the galaxies from subsample 4 often show two or more compact knots of star formation .",
    "thus , the total number of selected galaxies is 803 , or @xmath1 10 times larger than the sample of star - forming green pea galaxies of @xcite . in general , the selected lcgs are faint objects with low extinction .",
    "their median sdss @xmath24 apparent magnitude and reddening @xmath25(@xmath26 ) range from 20.3 and 0.10 for subsample 1 to 18.4 and 0.15 for subsample 4 ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the h@xmath5 luminosity @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) with redshift @xmath0 is shown in fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is seen that the selected galaxies span a large range of redshifts , from @xmath1 0.02 to @xmath1 0.63 .",
    "the apparent increase of @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) with redshift , for @xmath0@xmath270.2 , is likely the result of a selection effect ( called the malmquist bias ) : only the brightest galaxies at high redshift were observed spectroscopically in the sdss .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that galaxies with ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 100  are distributed more uniformly with redshift than those with lower ew(h@xmath5 ) , which tend to populate the lower redshift region .",
    "this difference is likely also due to a selection effect .",
    "the [ o iii ] @xmath124363  emission line in objects with a high ew(h@xmath5 ) is stronger .",
    "hence it can be measured with a good accuracy even in high redshift objects , which helps to fulfill the selection criterion 3 above and allows the inclusion of the galaxy in the lcg sample .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a remarkable feature : there is an upper limit of @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) at the level of @xmath1 2.5@xmath710@xmath28 erg s@xmath9 ( shown by the horizontal dashed line ) , which is almost not redshift dependent , despite the fact that none of our selection criteria sets an upper limit to the h@xmath5 luminosity .",
    "the presence of this upper limit suggests the existence of a self - regulating mechanism in star formation which somehow forbids the formation of more luminous star - forming regions .",
    "there is probably a negative feedback mechanism due to the intense uv radiation of the present starburst which prevents further star formation in lcgs . while beyond the scope of the present paper , the role of the ionizing radiation from young massive starbursts in shutting off star formation beyond a given threshold luminosity , should be investigated .      the range of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is @xmath1 2.5 times larger than that for the green pea galaxies of @xcite .",
    "those authors and @xcite suggested that green pea galaxies form a new class of objects .",
    "we will argue now that this is not the case and that they are just a subset of lcgs .",
    "nearby ( @xmath0 @xmath10 ) luminous compact emission - line galaxies have been known for decades .",
    "examples of such objects are , in order of decreasing @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) ( we give the logarithm of the aperture- and extinction - corrected @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) in parentheses for each object in units of erg s@xmath9 ) : mrk 930 ( 41.57 ) , sbs 0335052e ( 41.24 ) , hs 0837 + 4717 ( 41.10 ) and ii zw 40 ( 40.81 ) .",
    "some of them have been studied in great detail ( see e.g. the studies of sbs 0335052e by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these objects are known as blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcd ) and are plotted as large open circles in fig .",
    "a recent review of bcd properties is given by @xcite .",
    "we see that the @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) of these bcds are comparable to those of lcgs at the low - luminosity end of the sample .",
    "other well - known bcds have lower @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) , below our cut - off : tol1214277 ( 40.43 ) , i zw 18 ( 39.72 for a distance of 15 mpc ) and mrk 209 ( 39.55 ) . in other words , lcgs are the same type of objects as bcds except that they are more luminous in the mean .    by the same token , green pea galaxies do not form a distinct class of objects from lcgs .",
    "they are just a subsample of the class of lcgs , in a restricted redshift range . at other redshifts ,",
    "the same galaxies would not look green , but blue , pink or brown .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we show sdss images of eight galaxies from our lcg sample , located at different distances .",
    "lcgs in the upper panel are galaxies from subsample 1 with round shape , while those in the lower panel are galaxies from subsample 2 with extended emission and/or disturbed morphology .",
    "it is seen that , as the strong emission lines ( the balmer lines and the [ o iii ] @xmath124959 , @xmath125007  lines ) shift through the different sdss filters , the colors of the lcgs as seen in the composite sdss @xmath14 images change with redshift .",
    "they are blue at low redshifts , becoming pink at @xmath0 @xmath27 0.1 , green at @xmath0 @xmath1 0.2 and brown at @xmath0 @xmath1 0.6 .",
    "we next compare the colors of the lcgs to those of normal galaxies and qsos .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the @xmath29 vs @xmath30 color - color diagram for lcgs ( filled and open circles and triangles ) . for comparison",
    "are also shown representative objects classified in the sdss as galaxies ( black dots ) and qsos @xcite ( grey dots ) .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 colors for lcgs span very large ranges , extending over 2.5 mag and 3.5 mag respectively .",
    "these ranges are the largest for lcgs with a high h@xmath5 equivalent width ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath2 100  ( filled symbols ) .",
    "such large color ranges are not due to differences in galaxy physical properties , but to a large redshift range .",
    "galaxies with strong emission lines at @xmath0 @xmath1 0.1  0.3 would appear in the left upper corner of the diagram , while the same galaxies at @xmath0 @xmath1 0.4  0.5 would occupy the region with @xmath30 @xmath23 1.0 , in the extreme right part of the diagram .",
    "the location of the lcgs in the @xmath29 vs @xmath30 diagram is very different from that of the bulk of galaxies without or with weak line emission in their spectra ( grey dots ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that many lcgs are located in the region with ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) @xmath1 ( 0.0  0.5 , 0.0  0.5 ) populated by qsos .",
    "a significant fraction of these lcgs are automatically classified in the sdss as qsos because of their compact morphology , while their spectra are that of star - forming galaxies rather than agns .",
    "what is the overlap between the green pea sample of @xcite and our lcg sample ?",
    "@xcite selected star - forming green pea galaxies by requiring them to be in the left upper region of the ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) diagram , delineated by the two straight lines in fig .",
    "we have encircled in this figure all the 66 lcgs that are also in the green pea sample of @xcite .",
    "the latter sample contains a total of 80 objects . out of the 14 missing objects ,",
    "12 were rejected because of their noisy spectra with a non - detected or weak [ o iii ] @xmath124363 emission line , although they were present in the initial sample .",
    "thus , our lcg selection criteria missed only two green pea star - forming galaxies out of a total of 80 galaxies , i.e. the overlap factor between the green pea and lcg samples is 98% ! on the other hand , more than half of the lcgs in the region of green pea star - forming galaxies delineated by the two straight lines were not selected by @xcite .",
    "all these galaxies have a green color on the sdss images and are at redshifts @xmath0 @xmath1 0.1  0.3 .",
    "as for the remaining lcgs , to the right of the solid lines in the color - color diagram , they have redshifts @xmath0 @xmath31 0.1 or @xmath0 @xmath23 0.3 , and would not be picked up by the green pea selection criteria , although they are the same type of objects , but at different redshifts .",
    "it is interesting to note that the h@xmath5 luminosities of the five known low - metallicity compact galaxies that are thought to contain agns , as evidenced by the strong broad components of their h@xmath20 and h@xmath5 emission lines @xcite put them in the class of lcgs .",
    "these objects fulfill all the selection criteria discussed above for lcgs .",
    "they are shown by the large filled circles in fig .",
    "their redshifts are in the range 0.10.3 , and therefore they can also be classified as green pea galaxies . however , in the ( @xmath29 ) - ( @xmath30 ) color - color diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , only two low - metallicity agns fall into the green pea region .",
    "the two other low - metallicity agns are located outside both the green pea and lcg regions .",
    "the latter two objects show abnormally red @xmath29 and @xmath30 colors , probably due to high dust extinction .",
    "the fifth low - metallicity agn studied by @xcite is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] because it is beyond the sdss sky area and therefore we have no @xmath32 colors for it .",
    "it is not unreasonable that agns tend to occur in more luminous and hence more massive compact galaxies , as these have more massive star formation and hence are more favorable to the formation of intermediate - mass black holes",
    ". it would be interesting to obtain high - resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of more objects in the lcg sample to look for more objects with broad components which may contain agns .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows by small filled and open symbols the positions of lcgs in the [ o iii ] @xmath125007/h@xmath5 vs. [ n ii ] @xmath126583/h@xmath20 diagram ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bpt ) .",
    "the star and filled square represent respectively the well - studied bcds sbs 0335052e and hs 0837 + 4717 .",
    "hs 0837 + 4717 lies in the same region as the lcgs while sbs 0335052e lies to the left , having an abnormally low [ n ii ] @xmath126583/h@xmath20 ratio .",
    "this is because sbs 0335052e has a low n / o abundance ratio , a characteristic of extremely low - metallicity bcds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ionizing parameter of its h ii region is high , resulting in a small abundance of singly ionized nitrogen . for comparison ,",
    "the grey dots represent all galaxies from the sdss dr7 with flux errors smaller than 10% for each of the four emission lines h@xmath5 , [ o iii ] @xmath125007 , h@xmath20 and [ n ii ] @xmath126583 .",
    "the emission line fluxes for the sdss galaxies shown by grey dots were measured using the technique developed by @xcite and are taken from the sdss website.added/index.html . ]",
    "these galaxies are distributed into two wings , the left one thought to contain star - forming galaxies and the right one agn hosts .",
    "the dashed line represents the empirical divisory line between star - forming galaxies and agns proposed by @xcite , while the continuous line represents the upper limit for pure star - forming galaxies taken from @xcite .",
    "we see that the lcgs lie in the low - metallicity part of what is usually considered as the region of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we note that the five low - metallicity agn candidates from @xcite and @xcite , represented by large filled circles , lie in the same region as the lcgs .",
    "the bpt diagram can not distinguish between star - forming galaxies and agn hosts in the low - metallicity regime .",
    "we derived element abundances in all 803 lcgs from the narrow emission - line fluxes , using the so - called direct method .",
    "this method is based on the determination of the electron temperature within the [ o iii ] zone from the [ o iii]@xmath124363/(@xmath124959+@xmath125007 ) line ratio .",

    "equivalent width of hydrogen absorption lines ew(abs ) are derived in such a way to obtain the closest agreement between the extinction - corrected and theoretical recombination hydrogen emission - line fluxes normalized to the h@xmath5 flux .",
    "it is assumed that ew(abs ) is the same for all hydrogen lines .",
    "this assumption is justified by the evolutionary stellar population synthesis models of @xcite .    the physical conditions , and the ionic and total heavy element abundances in the h ii regions were derived following @xcite .",

    "the element abundances then do not depend sensitively on @xmath38 .",
    "we use the ionization correction factors ( icfs ) from @xcite to correct for unseen stages of ionization and to derive the total o , n , ne , s , cl , ar , and fe abundances .    the dependence of the oxygen abundance 12 + log o / h of the lcgs on their redshift @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "there is no clear variation of 12+log o / h with @xmath0 .",
    "the median value of 12 + log o / h for the whole sample is @xmath1 8.11 or 0.26 solar ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this median value is similar to the one obtained by @xcite for the subsample of the green pea galaxies of @xcite they used .",

    "we have used the direct method while @xcite have used an empirical calibration method based on the [ n ii ] @xmath126583/h@xmath20 flux ratio , despite the fact that nearly all their spectra contain a strong enough [ o iii ] @xmath124363 emission line , which can be used to determine the electron temperature of the [ o iii ] zone .",
    "evidently , there is an offset between oxygen abundances derived by the direct method and those derived by the strong - line empirical method used by @xcite .",
    "a more detailed comparison between abundances obtained by us and by @xcite is given in section 5.3 .",
    "[ fig6]a also shows that lcgs with lower equivalent widths ew(h@xmath5 ) ( open symbols ) have systematically higher 12 + log o / h than lcgs with higher equivalent widths ( filled symbols ) .",

    "this sample is the same as in @xcite , with the addition of galaxies from @xcite and includes mainly nearby low - metallicity and low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the distribution of heavy element abundance ratios in lcgs is very similar to those in bcd galaxies , despite the fact that lcgs have higher oxygen abundances ( 12 + log o / h @xmath2 7.6 ) , while the bcd galaxies span a larger range of metallicities , with 12 + log o / h as low as 7.12 .",
    "this implies that the chemical enrichment history has been very similar in bcds and lcgs .",

[ fig7]a ) shows a significant spread of n / o values , in the range 0.9 - 1.7 at 12 + log o / h @xmath2 7.6 , for both the lcg and bcd samples . however , there is no appreciable increase of n / o with increasing 12 + log o / h up to @xmath1 8.4 , suggesting that nitrogen is mainly of primary origin in lcgs .",
    "this is at variance with the results of @xcite who find a clear increase of n / o with 12 + log o / h over the whole 7.5 - 8.4 range , suggesting that secondary production of nitrogen is important .",
    "additionally , @xcite derived a high log n / o , larger than the solar ratio of 0.86 @xcite , in a significant number of green pea galaxies with 12 + log o / h in the range @xmath1 8.1 - 8.4 .",

    "it is worth noting the increase of the ne / o abundance ratio and the decrease of the fe / o ratio with increasing oxygen abundance .",

    "assuming continuous star formation , then with a hydrogen gas supply of 10@xmath17 @xmath4 and a sfr of 50 @xmath4 yr@xmath9 , the time for gas depletion is only @xmath1 2@xmath710@xmath54 yr . clearly a burst mode is required for the lcgs with the highest sfrs .",
    "while the young stellar population in our galaxies is modeled by a short burst occurring at @xmath45(young ) @xmath1 3 - 4 myr ( table [ tab1 ] ) , the older stellar population is fitted by a model with continuous star formation starting at @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath45(old ) and ending at @xmath48 , with @xmath46 @xmath23 @xmath48 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45(old ) sheds light on the evolutionary status of the galaxy ( whether the galaxy is young or old ) , and helps to understand the character of its star formation ( whether it proceeds in a bursting or continuous manner ) .",
    "[ fig16 ] shows how the age of the oldest stellar population @xmath45(old ) depends on the total stellar mass @xmath50 .",
    "the dashed lines are the loci of constant continuous star formation rate corresponding to , from left to right , sfr = 1 , 10 and 100 @xmath4 yr@xmath9 .",
    "it can be seen that galaxies with high ew(h@xmath5 ) ( @xmath6 100 ) denoted by filled symbols do not show any evident trend . on the other hand , there is an increase of @xmath45(old ) with increasing @xmath50 for galaxies with ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath31 100 .",
    "this implies that , among the galaxies with low ew(h@xmath5 ) , massive galaxies are in general older than lower mass galaxies .",
    "the absence of such a dependence for galaxies with high ew(h@xmath5 ) may in part be explained by the uncertainties in the sed modeling .",
    "indeed , the fraction of the light produced by the old stellar population in spectra of galaxies with a high ew(h@xmath5 ) is much lower than that in galaxies with a low ew(h@xmath5 ) , both because of the brighter young stellar population and of the higher contribution of gaseous emission .",
    "furthermore , galaxies with high ew(h@xmath5 ) have systematically higher redshifts compared to galaxies with low ew(h@xmath5 ) .",
    "their larger distances make their continua weaker , which renders their sed fitting more uncertain .",
    "this is because of the following selection effect .",
    "we select only galaxies with [ o iii ] @xmath124363 that can be measured with good accuracy for abundance determination , and this line is stronger in galaxies with high ew(h@xmath5 ) . the location of the galaxies in fig .",

    "the largest offset is for low - mass galaxies with high ew(h@xmath5 ) ( filled symbols ) .",
    "the vast majority of these galaxies are located in the region corresponding to continuous sfrs @xmath31 1 @xmath4 yr@xmath9 , i.e. @xmath2 10 times lower than those derived from the ongoing star formation episode .",
    "this discrepancy is again an indication that star formation in the lcgs occurs in rare bursts of short duration , so that the sfr averaged over the lifetime of the galaxy is more than one order of magnitude lower than the one derived from the h@xmath20 luminosity .",
    "the bursting nature of star formation is less pronounced for the higher - mass galaxies with low ew(h@xmath5 ) ( open symbols ) : their continuous sfrs averaged over the galaxy s lifetime are only @xmath1 2 - 3 times lower than those derived from the ongoing episode of star formation .",
    "we discuss here the properties of a sample of luminous compact star - forming galaxies ( lcg ) selected from the data release 7 ( dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "we show that the so - called `` green pea '' galaxies discussed by @xcite are a subset of these lcgs .",
    "however , in contrast to @xcite who selected their green pea galaxies solely on the basis of broad - band sdss colors and compact structure , our lcg galaxies were chosen also on the basis of their spectroscopic properties .",
    "our main selection criteria are as follows : a ) a high extinction - corrected luminosity @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) @xmath23 3@xmath710@xmath22 erg s@xmath9 of the h@xmath5 emission line ; b ) a high equivalent width ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 50  of the h@xmath5 emission line ; c ) a strong [ o iii ] @xmath124363 emission line allowing accurate abundance determination ; d ) a compact structure on sdss images ; and e ) an absence of obvious agn spectroscopic features . using these criteria , we selected in total 803 galaxies , split into four subsamples based on the value of ew(h@xmath5 ) ( greater or smaller than 100 ) and morphological appearance ( round shape or some evidence of disturbed morphology ) .",
    "the selected galaxies have redshifts between 0.02 and 0.63 , a redshift range that is a factor @xmath2 2 higher than the redshift range @xmath0 = 0.112  0.360 of the green pea sample of @xcite .",
    "we find that the properties of lcgs and green pea galaxies selected from the sdss are in many respects similar to those of well - studied nearby luminous blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies , such as sbs 0335052e and hs 0837 + 4717 . since the color of an emission - line galaxy on the @xmath14 sdss composite image changes with its redshift , depending on which strong emission lines fall within a particular filter band , the lcgs display a variety of colors from intense blue for nearby galaxies with @xmath0 @xmath31 0.07 , through pink and green at redshifts",
    "@xmath0 @xmath1 0.09 and @xmath1 0.15  0.30 , respectively , to brown at redshifts @xmath0 @xmath1 0.6 .",
    "therefore , the green pea galaxy sample is just a subsample with a narrow redshift range of a larger lcg sample .",
    "a significant fraction of our lcgs have low redshifts ( @xmath0 @xmath31 0.1 ) , thus allowing the study of lcg properties in more detail than in the previous investigations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although our selection criteria do not set an upper limit on the luminosity @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) of the h@xmath5 emission line , we find that there is an upper bound to @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) at @xmath1 3@xmath710@xmath28 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "this implies a self - regulating mechanism of star formation that does not allow the formation of star - forming regions brighter than that limit in a galaxy .",

    "@xmath125007/h@xmath5 vs [ n ii ] @xmath126583/h@xmath20 diagnostic diagram , lcgs occupy the region of star - forming galaxies with the highest excitation . on the other hand ,",
    "the five low - metallicity agns discovered by @xcite and @xcite also lie in the same region .",
    "this implies that further detailed studies of lcgs may result in the discovery of a larger number of low - metallicity agns showing some seyfert 1 features such as broad hydrogen emission lines .",
    "we find that the oxygen abundances 12 + log o / h in lcgs are in the range 7.6  8.4 with a median value of @xmath1 8.11 , confirming the results of @xcite concerning a subset of the green pea sample of @xcite .",
    "this range of oxygen abundances is typical of nearby lower - luminosity bcds .",
    "we note , however , that the median oxygen abundance of @xmath1 8.7 , derived by @xcite for their green pea sample is overestimated , because those authors used empirical relations for abundance determinations , instead of the direct method used in this paper and in @xcite .",
    "there is no dependence of 12 + logo / h on redshift . on the other hand , we find that the oxygen abundances in galaxies with higher equivalent width ew(h@xmath5 ) are generally lower . as for the n / o ,",
    "ne / o , s / o , cl / o , ar / o and fe / o abundance ratios , they are similar to those found for lower - luminosity bcds .",
    "overall , we find no appreciable difference in element abundances between lcgs and bcds , implying a similar chemical enrichment history .",

    "* ) , lcgs form a common luminosity - metallicity relation , that for the most actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "some lcgs have oxygen abundances and luminosities similar to lbgs , despite much lower redshifts .",
    "this opens the possibility of studying lbgs through brighter and hence easier to observe lcgs .",
    "we develop a technique for determing galaxy masses by fitting the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by a model sed that includes both emission from stellar populations of different ages and the continuum emission from the ionized gas , the latter having not been considered by previous investigators .",
    "we show that such an omission results in an overestimate of the stellar mass .",
    "this effect is especially strong for galaxies with high ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath23 100 .",

    "we find a clear increase of the oxygen abundance with increasing total stellar mass of the galaxy in the mass - metallicity diagram .",
    "however , there is no correlation between the n / o abundance ratio and the total stellar mass for the lowest - mass galaxies , those with ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 100 , implying primary n production in those objects .",
    "there is however a total mass dependence of n / o for the highest - mass galaxies , those with ew(h@xmath5 ) @xmath31 100 , implying some secondary of n in those galaxies .",

    "star formation in lcgs at the rate derived from h@xmath20 emission can not be continuous , but rather must occur in strong short bursts separated by long quiescent phases , just as in bcds .",
