    "the propagation of high - peak power femtosecond laser pulses in optical media has attracted considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "these pulses undergo dramatic changes in their temporal , spatial and spectral properties due to their nonlinear interaction with the medium .",
    "the most fundamental process is self - focusing which causes the pulse to be compressed in space , resulting in an increase of the peak intensity @xcite .",
    "self - focusing would result in a catastrophic collapse of the pulse , but the self - focusing process is usually balanced by multiphoton ionization or excitation of the atoms or molecules in the medium , since the resulting ( quasi-)free electron density defocuses the pulse .",
    "the analysis of optical pulse propagation is usually based on the description of the pulse in terms of its complex field envelope , neglecting the underlying rapid oscillations at its carrier frequency .",
    "the resulting slowly varying envelope approximation reduces the maxwell s equations to higher dimensional nonlinear schdinger equations ( nlse ) .",
    "these equations are not integrable , so they do not have soliton solutions .",
    "however , they possess stationary solutions which are unstable on propagation .",
    "the self - focusing distance is determined as the ( first ) point of infinite intensity in the solution of the nlse .",
    "most of the quantitative analysis of self - focusing ( and further propagation ) of the pulse results from numerical computation .",
    "for example , from a curve - fitting procedure based on numerical simulations a popular analytical formula for the location of the first singularity ( self - focusing distance ) for the propagation of a cw laser beam has been given by dawes and marburger @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the input power scaled in units of the critical power for self - focusing , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 is the wavelength and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the linear and nonlinear indices of refraction , respectively @xcite .",
    "formula ( [ zsfmar ] ) has been verified in many experiments and numerical simulations . besides its accurateness and usefulness for estimations it however does not give much insight in the physics of the underlying process .    in order to get a deeper insight into a physical process , it is often useful to use approximative theories , even if full numerical solutions are available .",
    "a few approximations have been discussed already in the early review paper on self - focusing by marburger @xcite .",
    "the resulting expressions provide , however , rather qualitative than quantitative estimations only .",
    "alternative approaches have been proposed to analyze the effect of self - focusing , namely a systematic perturbation theory @xcite , a ray - equation approximation @xcite , an approach based on fermat s principle @xcite , a variational analysis @xcite , a paraxial parabolic approximation @xcite , or a source - dependent expansion method @xcite .",
    "the predictions of these models for the self - focusing distance agree quantitatively well with the exact solutions from numerical simulations for input powers close to the critical power , but deviate quickly as the power increases .    in this paper we present a quasianalytical approximation which provides a description of the self - focusing phenomenon not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "it is based on the variational approach using a trial solution , which contains a first - order perturbation correction of the phase resulting from the transverse distortion of the pulse .",
    "as we show below , predictions for the self - focusing distance , the on - axis peak intensity and the radius of the pulse within this ansatz are in better agreement with those of numerical simulations over a broad range of input powers than previous analytical results available in the literature .",
    "we show how the pulse separates into an inner and an outer self - trapped component along the propagation distance .",
    "the inner component self - focus , while the outer one stays as background .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we derive the phase correction of the pulse using first - order perturbation theory .",
    "the corrected form of the pulse is then used as trial solution in the lagrangian of the system to obtain equations for the self - focusing distance , the on - axis peak intensity and the radius of the pulse .",
    "next , the predictions of the approximation will be compared with those of the earlier models and of numerical simulations .",
    "finally , an analogy with the problem of a particle in a finite quantum well is presented . in this analogy",
    ", the bound state and its exponential - decaying wings penetrating a smooth potential wall correspond to the inner and outer component of the pulse , respectively .",
    "the self - focusing is associated with the shrinking of the width of the quantum well .",
    "we study the propagation of a linearly polarized laser beam in gases . for the explicit calculations we do not restrict to any specific gas .",
    "our analysis is based on the scalar wave equation , which can be obtained from the maxwell equations ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the third order nonlinear susceptibility coefficient of the medium , @xmath8 is the linear dielectric constant of the gas and c is the speed of light .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamics of the pulse up to the self - focusing distance only , we neglect the plasma effects ( @xmath9 ) , which usually balance the catastrophic collapse and , hence , influence mainly the propagation of the pulse after the self - focusing point . using the slowly varying envelope approximation , eq .",
