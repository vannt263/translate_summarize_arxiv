    "the most commonly studied hamiltonians of quantum spins and bosons include kinetic energy in the form of two site exchange .",
    "however , it was realized early on that , for lighter atoms , larger numbers of particles can permute their positions , leading to ring exchange terms.@xcite interest in such models subsequently developed for a number of reasons , most recently as a result of the possibility of the existence of a normal bose liquid .",
    "such a phase which might reconcile apparently contradictory observations in cuprate superconductors in the pseudogap regime where there is evidence of local pairing without superconductivity.@xcite indeed , the magnitude of ring exchange terms in high-@xmath2 materials could be a significant fraction of the two site exchange.@xcite    over the past several years , considerable numerical effort has been expended in looking at the low temperature phases of hamiltonians including ring exchange.@xcite interestingly , while the normal bose liquid has remained somewhat elusive , a rich panoply of other behavior has been observed , including striped order , neel antiferromagnetism , valence bond solids , and phase separation . the nature of the phase diagram and of the phase transitions between the different ordered phases remains an area of active inquiry.@xcite very recently it was proposed@xcite that ring exchange terms might be engineered into cold atomic gases , opening up the possibility that the effects of such terms could be studied in a situation where they can be tuned systematically , and hence the theoretical predictions checked experimentally .    in this paper",
    "we will extend our previous work@xcite on phase separation in the boson hubbard model with ring exchange .",
    "we focus on two dimensions , since that is the lowest dimension allowing ring exchange processes , and it is the effective dimension of the cuo@xmath3 sheets of the cuprate superconductors which have motivated much of the recent study of bose liquid phases .",
    "our key conclusion is that when the ring exchange energy scale exceeds approximately one half the on - site repulsion , the ground state is thermodynamically unstable to phase separation . adding a near - neighbor repulsion can prevent phase separation , but the ground state always has either nonzero checkerboard or superfluid order . because we use a break - up of the hamiltonian in constructing the path integral which has not been much employed before",
    ", we also describe some of the technical details of the simulation , including the effectiveness of different local quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) moves .",
    "the most simple boson hubbard model@xcite is : @xmath4 the operators @xmath5 create ( destroy ) a boson on site @xmath6 , and obey commutation rules @xmath7=\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the number operator is @xmath8 .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath9 measures the kinetic energy and @xmath1 the strength of the on - site repulsion .",
    "the sum @xmath10 is over near neighbors on a square lattice . in the limit",
    "@xmath11 this model maps onto the spin-1/2 xy model , with the magnetization playing the role of the bosonic density . by now",
    ", the @xmath12 phase diagram of the boson hubbard hamiltonian is well known.@xcite away from commensurate filling , the ground state is superfluid . at commensurate fillings , and for sufficiently large @xmath1 , a mott insulator forms in which each site is occupied by an integer number of particles .",
    "+ our goal is to consider the effect of a ring exchange term : @xmath13 the ring exchange term acts on four site plaquettes @xmath14 , destroying two particles which lie along one diagonal , and creating them on the other . because of the minus sign in ( [ ringexchangeterm ] ) , the energy decreases when the particles are exchanged .",
    "the basic qualitative picture behind the suggestion that the ring exchange term might give rise to a normal bose liquid is that if one starts with a superfluid phase , @xmath0 introduces local vortices in which two particles jump in opposite directions .",
    "these local twists , if sufficiently favored energetically , could compete with , and ultimately prevent , a coherent long range superflow of particles . at the same time , such a hopping process increases ( local ) quantum fluctuations , and would not be expected to make the system incompressible ( a mott insulator )",
    ". therefore one might have a normal bose liquid .    as we shall see , we find that this ring exchange term causes phase separation rather than a normal bose liquid .",
    "it is natural to attempt to resurrect the liquid by adding a longer range repulsion which acts against particle clustering .",
    "the most simple form is a near - neighbor repulsion : @xmath15 the effects of near neighbor repulsion in the absence of ring exchange have been well - studied in the context of the boson hubbard hamiltonian.@xcite they are perhaps most simply ascertained by considering the hard - core limit and the equivalent spin model .",
    "as commented earlier , the boson kinetic energy corresponds to an @xmath16 spin coupling .",
    "@xmath17 corresponds to a @xmath18 coupling .",
    "thus when @xmath19 the spin model is in the @xmath16 universality class ( a boson superfluid ) and for @xmath20 the spin model is in the ising universality class ( a checkerboard charge density boson insulator ) .",
    "a considerable amount of work has also been done on looking for supersolid phases which combine superfluid and charge density wave ( cdw ) order.@xcite",
    "our quantum monte carlo simulations are performed using a world line algorithm with a decomposition involving four site matrix elements .",
    "we discuss the algorithm in detail here because this decomposition , which is similar but not identical to reference @xcite , is used considerably less frequently than the more conventional approach which involves two site matrix elements.@xcite in fact , to our knowledge , it has not been employed before for hamiltonians including ring exchange , although stochastic series expansion approaches@xcite are formally very similar .",
    "a specific issue we will address is the effect of different local moves on the measurement of the energy .",
    "we begin by representing the partition function as a path integral , in which @xmath21 is the imaginary time evolution operator , @xmath22 .",
    "the goal is to take the exponential of the full hamiltonian , which can not be computed , and express it in terms of exponentials whose numerical values can be written down . in order to accomplish this , we write the full imaginary time evolution operator as a product of infinitesimal evolution operators over short imaginary times @xmath23 : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is chosen to be a sufficiently large integer so as to make @xmath26 times any two of the energy scales in @xmath27 small , as discussed further below .",
    "we then divide the sum over all plaquette operators into four classes depicted by the different shadings ( colors on - line ) in fig .",
    "[ decomposition ] .",
    "that is , the full hamiltonian is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 groups together all plaquettes of a given shading . in order to avoid overcounting the kinetic energy , on - site , and near neighbor interaction terms in the hamiltonian we define , @xmath30 with @xmath31 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hat\\mathcal v_p = v ( \\hat n_{p1}\\hat n_{p2}+ \\hat n_{p3}\\hat n_{p4}+\\hat n_{p1}\\hat n_{p3}+\\hat n_{p2}\\hat n_{p4 } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is important to emphasize that while plaquette operators acting on neighboring plaquettes do not commute , all plaqette operators within the same shading do commute , since they do not  touch . \"",
    "this independence will enable us to compute their exponentials .",
    "now we express each infinitesimal evolution operator as a product : @xmath32 substituting expression ( [ partition-2 ] ) in expression ( [ partition-1 ] ) , we get : @xmath33    the errors made in breaking up @xmath34 , eq .",
    "[ partition-2 ] , go as the commutator of the individual pieces , and therefore as @xmath26 .",
    "it might be thought that the accumulation of the @xmath26 errors across the @xmath25 imaginary time slices might lead to an error linear in @xmath23 .",
    "however , the expectation value of any hermitian operator@xcite has a trotter error which is quadratic in @xmath23 .    to complete the evaluation of the trace , we work in the basis of occupation numbers @xmath35 . inserting a complete set of states @xmath36 between each pair of exponentials ,",
    "we get : @xmath37    the superscripts @xmath38 appearing in the sets @xmath39 label the imaginary time , emphasizing that a different complete set of states has been introduced between each pair of exponentials .",
    "since operators acting on plaquettes with the same shading commute , each matrix element in ( [ partition-4 ] ) can be written as a product of four site matrix elements @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the state at imaginary time @xmath42 ( @xmath42 is a multiple of @xmath43 ) of the four sites belonging to plaquette @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a product over all matrix elements between times @xmath42 and @xmath46 .",
    "the entire evolution is represented by an interconnected set of the cubes of fig .",
    "[ plaquette]b , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ decomposition]b .    since each @xmath47 conserves the sum of the boson numbers on the four spatial sites , the occupation numbers living on these cubes trace out continous ` world - lines ' of particles which wiggle and deform during their evolution .",
    "furthermore , because we are evaluating the trace of @xmath48 , the occupation numbers and associated world lines are periodic in imaginary time .",
    "we will discuss the sampling of the expression for @xmath49 , and the associated conservation laws , in more detail below .",
    "summarizing , the partition function takes the simple form of a sum of products of four site matrix elements , @xmath50 the imaginary time index @xmath38 runs from @xmath51 to @xmath25 with step @xmath52 . each matrix element in ( [ partition-5 ] ) can be computed by numerical diagonalization if we assume that occupation numbers are never greater than four .",
    "( this restriction is satisfied in all simulations here , since the average densities studied are of order unity.@xcite ) each site has five possible states and the number of different states for one plaquette is @xmath53 . to compute the exponential of @xmath47 then requires the diagonalization of a @xmath54 matrix .",
    "in order to perform measurements , one needs to generate sets of world lines with the boltzmann weight given by the summand of eq .",
    "[ partition-5 ] .",
    "this is done using a metropolis algorithm .",
    "one starts with straight world lines , then suggests local deformations and accepts them with probability @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the ratio of the boltzmann weight after the move to that before . in the usual way , this satisfies detailed balance . to ensure ergodicity of the algorithm , different kinds of moves have to be included , like pull moves ( fig .",
    "[ localmoves]a ) , `` baby '' pull moves ( fig .",
    "[ localmoves]b ) , twist moves ( fig .  [",
    "localmoves]c ) , and `` baby '' twist moves ( fig .",
    "[ localmoves]d ) .",
    "only a few of the plaquette matrix elements change when one of these local moves is performed .",
    "the most complex is the twist move ( fig .",
    "[ localmoves]c ) which involves 10 matrix elements ( only 5 cubes are shown in order to make the figure clearer ) .",
    "these different kinds of moves are required in order to make the algorithm ergodic . as an illustration",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ energyvsmoves-1 ] the energy per particle of free bosons as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath57 , with various types of moves suppressed .",
    "we can see that the correct energy @xmath58 is obtained only when both pull and `` baby '' pull moves are included .    0.5 cm    it is notable in fig .  5 that the correct energy is obtained even without the twist moves .",
    "it might be thought that this is because @xmath59 and that twist moves will become important when turning on interactions , especially with ring exchange processes . however this is not the case , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ energyvsmoves-2 ] .",
    "we believe this to be an advantage of the four site decomposition over the two site one .",
    "the four site decomposition already analytically includes twists in the evaluation of the matrix elements of the exponentials of the @xmath60 .    while including only pull and `` baby ''",
    "pull moves seems to get the energy right on the lattice sizes studied above , our simulations are done with all moves included .",
    "these local moves all take the form of local distortions of existing world - lines and hence can not change @xmath61 .",
    "thus our code works in the canonical ensemble .",
    "it simulates whatever value of @xmath61 with which we initialize the lattice .",
    "if desired , we can make contact with the grand - canonical ensemble , by _ computing _ the chemical potential as the energy cost , in the ground state , of adding a boson to the system , @xmath62 .",
    "actually , canonical simulations have certain advantages in exploring phase separation , as we shall see , and as has previously been described.@xcite    our simulations also are confined to the zero - winding sector of the space of all possible paths .",
    "this has implications for how we measure the superfluid density @xmath63 .",
    "consider the well - known relation,@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dimension of the system , and @xmath66 the mean square of the winding number operator which measures the net flow of particles off the right side of the lattice and over to the left side .",
    "our local moves can not change the winding , as is evident by comparing the configurations of fig .",
    "[ winding ] .",
    "hence , using eq .",
    "( [ rhos ] ) our algorithm would systematically give a zero value for the superfluid density , if we begin in a @xmath67 configuration .",
    "however , we can still measure @xmath63 .",
    "the procedure is as follows : we define the pseudo - current operator ( using the notation of fig .",
    "[ plaquette]b for the site labels ) @xmath68 where the sum @xmath69 is over all cubes of fig .",
    "[ decomposition]b between times @xmath38 and @xmath70 .",
    "these quantities measure the number of particles which jump in the positive @xmath71 and @xmath72 directions between imaginary times @xmath38 and @xmath70 .",
    "the winding number operators in both @xmath71 and @xmath72 directions are then given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are respectively the number of sites in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 directions .",
    "we measure also the auto - correlation function of the pseudo - current : @xmath76 and compute its fourier transform via @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "+ one can show that these pseudocurrent operators are related to the winding by , @xmath79 as already stated , the measurement of the winding number , and hence the fourier transform at @xmath80 , will give a zero value .",
    "but we can avoid the problem by considering the finite frequency response .",
    "in fact , one can show@xcite that the correct , nonzero , winding number and @xmath63 are given by taking the zero frequency limit of @xmath81 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ extrapolation ] .",
    "we can work in the hard - core limit by running a soft - core code at large @xmath1 , or more directly by forbidding the acceptance of multiple occupancies in our monte carlo moves .",
    "this also simplifies the computation of the matrix elements in ( [ partition-5 ] ) since we can restrict to single occupancy states ( and hence diagonalize only a @xmath83 matrix ) .",
    "such a hard - core model is equivalent to replacing the standard bosonic commutation rules by the hard - core rules , @xmath84=0 &      \\forall i\\neq j\\\\ \\bigl\\lbrace a_i^\\dagger , a_i^\\dagger      \\bigr\\rbrace=0 & \\bigl[a_i^\\dagger , a_j^\\dagger \\bigr]=0 & \\forall      i\\neq j\\\\ \\bigl\\lbrace a_i , a_i^\\dagger \\bigr\\rbrace=1 &      \\bigl[a_i , a_j^\\dagger \\bigr]=0 & \\forall i\\neq j \\ , ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is an anti - commutator . the usual bosonic commutators between operators acting on different sites ensure that the wave function is symmetric in the exchange of particles , as required for bosons .",

    "but if the density is averaged over only a few iterations , we observe a density profile reflecting the clustering ( fig .",
    "[ typicaldensityprofiles ] ) .    to corroborate further that this negative compressibility is associated with phase separation , we define the observable @xmath107 to be the average of the density structure factor over the smallest values of the wave vector : @xmath108    @xmath107 measures modulations of the density profile with wave lengths on the order of the size of the lattice .",

    "three different behaviors of the density correlations are observable : a cdw ( density order at momentum @xmath142 ) when @xmath0 is weak ( well known in the model without ring exchange processes),@xcite at intermediate @xmath0 a uniform phase where the density structure factor is small at all wavelengths , and a regime of phase separation ( @xmath107 large ) when @xmath0 is big . as expected , @xmath17 does suppress the tendency for clustering .",

    "[ omegaandspipivsk ] are also directly visible in real space snapshots of the densities in the course of the simulations ( fig .",
    "[ first - nearest - neighbors ] ) .    despite the absence of density order ,",
    "the uniform phase ( fig .  [ first - nearest - neighbors]b ) is not a bose liquid .",

    "it remains non - zero in the cluster phase , though it does drop by a factor of two when clumping begins .",
    "there is no bose liquid phase in the model .",
    "( of course , if the density is sufficiently small , then an island phase in which the boson cloud does not span the system will have vanishing @xmath63 .",
    "this situation also occurs for bosons in a confining potential , where the phase is nevertheless commonly referred to as being superfluid .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of a ring exchange term in the hard- and soft - core bose hubbard model , also including a near - neighbor repulsion , using quantum monte carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "it had been suggested that this term might lead to a normal bose liquid phase , that is , one which is compressible but non superfluid .",
    "for the hard - core case , we reproduced results obtained by melko _",
    "@xcite in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "however , working in the canonical ensemble enables us to capture and characterize a hitherto unsuspected cluster phase of the model . no bose liquid phase was observed .",
    "thus the speculation of paramekanti _ et al _ @xcite , that the relaxation of the hard - core constraint might give rise to a bose liquid does not appear to be borne out .",
    "the tendency to clustering can be understood by analyzing the effect of @xmath0 on a two boson system .",
    "we have shown numerically that @xmath0 acts much like an attractive potential , and that when it is sufficiently large , the two boson form a bound state .",
    "this attraction leads to clustering in systems with larger boson numbers .",
    "we saw that , while a near neighbor repulsion competes with this clustering , it could not create a normal bose liquid . at weak @xmath0 it promotes an alternate charge density wave insulator . at strong @xmath0 , while @xmath17 does help prevent clustering , @xmath63 remains nonzero .",
    "it might be interesting to study models with longer range interactions which will act together to prevent phase separation , but compete with each other by promoting phases at different ordering momenta .",
    "such models might , finally , realize the bose liquid phase .    to conclude ,",
    "let us comment on the implications of our work for the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg model with a ring exchange term .",
    "the kinetic energy term in the hard - core boson hubbard model maps onto @xmath143 with exchange constant @xmath144 . at the value @xmath137 in our soft core model ,",
    "double occupancy is already very rare at half - filling , and hence we are almost in the hard - core limit .",
    "the value of the ring exchange energy scale required to drive phase separation for this @xmath1 is @xmath145 , or in other words , @xmath146 . to reproduce the near - neighbor coupling of the @xmath147 components of spin in the heisenberg model",
    "we must include a near - neighbor repulsion in the bose - hubbard model , a term which clearly would suppress phase separation .",
    "thus we expect ring exchange to have the potential to drive phase separation in the heisenberg model only for @xmath0 considerably greater than @xmath148 .",
