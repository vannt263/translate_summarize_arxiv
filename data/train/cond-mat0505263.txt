    "our work is concentrated mainly on the tube structures which can be viewed as the rolling of graphene like honeycomb planes of si or iii - v elements on a cylinder of radius @xmath6 .",
    "starting from the precursor graphene - like honeycomb structures we investigated their stability , energetics and electronic properties of these nanotubes .",
    "since o , o@xmath7 , si , au and h are critical elements for various processes on si , we also examined the adsorption of these atoms on swsint .",

    "it should be noted that dft based methods provide reliable predictions for the ground state properties , but band gaps are usually underestimated .",
    "hence the energy band structure obtained from the single particle energy eigenvalues of kohn - sham equations are only approximations to the real energy bands .",
    "proper many - body self - energy corrections can be made by using gw method.@xcite recently , gw energies are compared with dft - lda results of @xmath11 swcnts which indicates shifts of valence and conduction bands and considerable increase of lda band gap from 0.2 ev to 0.6 ev.@xcite it is suggested that gw corrections are small for large radius swcnts .",

    "the stability of the structures we studied is the most crucial aspect of our work , since it provides valuable information for the synthesis of these materials in future . in this respect",
    "an extensive analysis of stability has been carried out for various nanotubes .",
    "first , we applied a radial deformation to certain nanotubes and optimized their structures to see whether they relax to their original , undeformed circular forms under zero external force .",
    "furthermore , we have performed , finite temperature _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics calculations up to 1000 k using nos@xmath12 thermostat@xcite for 250 time steps ( 0.5 ps ) to check whether the optimized structure will be affected from random thermal motion of atoms or they maintain their tubular form at high - temperature .",
    "we believe that if there were any kind of structural instability it would be initiated and also enhanced within these time - steps at high temperature .",
    "one of the main difficulty for synthesizing si nanotubes seems to be the absence of 2d silicon layer similar to the graphene structure of carbon .",
    "this is traced to the fact that in contrast to carbon , @xmath13-hybridization in si is more stable than @xmath14-hybridization.@xcite in view of this situation we examined whether the graphene - like 2d sheet of silicon can be stable .",
    "two dimensional hexagonal lattice forming a honeycomb structure in the @xmath15-plane has been periodically repeated along @xmath16-axis with 10 @xmath10 spacing to minimize interlayer interactions . in order to reduce the effects of the constraints to be imposed by using the primitive unit cell we performed structure optimizations on the ( 2x2 ) cell in the @xmath15-plane .",
    "our calculations revealed that the planar structure ( where all atoms lie in the same plane ) is metastable , but it is buckled by 0.45 @xmath10 relative vertical displacement of alternate atoms on the hexagons .",
    "the gain of energy upon buckling is 30 mev / atom .",
    "the binding energy is calculated to be 4.9 ev / atom which is 0.6 ev lower than si diamond structure and the average distance between nearest si atoms is 2.2@xmath10 . in the rest of the paper",
    "this graphene - like structure will be specified as buckled honeycomb structure . as shown in fig.[fig : graphene ] , the detailed band structure and total density of states ( tdos ) analysis indicate that both buckled and planar system have large band gaps along @xmath17k and mk directions , but conduction and valence bands cross the fermi level at the * k*-point of brillouin zone .",
    "the electronic structure of the system does not change significantly as a result of buckling , except some of the bands split due to the lowering of the rotation symmetry . using a similar method but different pseudopotentials and exchange correlation potential takeda _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have examined planar and buckled honeycomb structures of si .",
    "our results obtained in four times larger cell hence allowing more variational freedom are in overall agrement with the results in ref .",
    "moreover , we performed an _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics calculations on 2x2 supercell providing further evidence that buckled honeycomb structure is stable at 500k for 250 time steps .    .",
    "the inset shows the 1/12 of hexagonal brillouin zone . ]",
    "next we address whether a graphite like structure of si ( or graphitic si ) can form ?",
    "our study distinguished chemisorption and physisorption states in the interlayer interaction , in contrast to only the physisorption state in graphite.@xcite the chemisorption state corresponding to a smaller lattice parameter @xmath18 is energetically more favorable , namely the binding is 5.1 ev which is 0.4 ev smaller than that of the bulk si .",
    "we note , however , that the lattice parameters , binding energies depend on the approximation of exchange - correlation potential.@xcite present gga calculations yield relatively larger interlayer distance and requires the incorporation of long range van der walls ( vdw ) interaction . such an analysis related with the binding of graphite showing that the lattice parameter calculated by gga is improved upon including vdw attraction has been presented elsewhere.@xcite    similar to si , the honeycomb structures of alp , gaas and gan are found to be also stable , but less energetic relative to the bulk crystal by 0.8 , 1.1 and 0.6 ev per basis , respectively .",
    "however , the buckling is not favored in order to hinder the formation of dipole layer .",
    "having discussed the stability of si buckled honeycomb structure ( si - hc ) , now we present our systematic analysis of @xmath11 zigzag and @xmath19 armchair swsints for different @xmath20 values ; namely @xmath21 for zigzag and @xmath22 for armchair structures .",
    "the ( 3,0 ) zigzag swsint has clustered upon structure relaxation indicating that it is not stable even at t=0 k. while the structure optimization has resulted in a regular ( 4,0 ) and ( 5,0 ) tubular structures , the @xmath23 md calculations showed that these nanotubes eventually transform into cluster at higher temperatures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] .",
    "significant distortions can be easily noticed in ( 6,0 ) and also ( 7,0 ) swsints , but tubular character and hexagonal structures on the surface have remained . the ( 6,0 ) zigzag tube , which has a radius of @xmath24 as well as those with larger radii remain stable at temperatures up to 800 k. barnard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also reported the instability of ( 3,0 ) swsint in their first - principles study , but they considered ( 4,0 ) and ( 5,0 ) swsints as stable structures depending on their geometry optimization performed at t=0 k. present results set a limit for fabricating small radius swsints .",
    "the first and second nearest neighbor interactions between si atoms become relevant for the stability of small radius nanotubes and causes clusterings , if @xmath25 .",
    "similar behavior is also obtained for @xmath19 armchair swsints .",
    "for example ( 3,3 ) swsint is clustered at 800 k in spite of the fact that geometry optimization yields tubular structure at t=0 k. on the other hand , the ( 6,6 ) tube having relatively larger radius remained stable at 800 k after 250 time steps .",
    "in contrast to @xmath19 swsints which are found unstable for @xmath1 , the ( 3,3 ) swcnt is known to be stable and experimentally fabricated.@xcite the difference in the chemical behavior of c and si can be traced to the difference in their @xmath26-bonding capabilities .",
    "si tends to utilize all of its three valence @xmath27-orbitals , resulting in @xmath13-hybridization .",
    "in contrast , the relatively large promotion energy from c-_2s _ to c-_2p _ orbitals explains how carbon will activate one valence @xmath27-orbital at a time leading , in turn , to @xmath28-hybridizations in 1d , 2d and 3d structures .",
    "this is the explanation why tubular structures of c are more stable than those of si.@xcite moreover , since the interatomic distance increases significantly in going from c to si , the @xmath29 overlap decreases accordingly , resulting in much weaker @xmath26-bonding for si tubes in comparison with that for carbon tubes .",
    "after the discussion of stability , we next analyze the energetics , namely the behavior of binding energy ( @xmath30 ) as a function of the radius ( or @xmath20 ) of the tube .",
    "@xmath30 per atom is calculated using the expression , @xmath31-n(e_t[si])\\}/n\\ ] ]    in terms of the total energy of the optimized swsint having @xmath32 si atoms per unit cell , @xmath33 $ ] , and the total energy of @xmath32 , free si atom @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "it is found that @xmath35 4.9 ev and slightly increases as the radius @xmath6 ( or @xmath20 ) increases for both zigzag and armchair swsints as displayed in fig.[fig : binding ] .",
    "the energy increase with @xmath20 is small . according to our results",
    "@xmath30 s of @xmath19 armchair swsints are @xmath36 ev larger than those of @xmath11 zigzag ones because of their relatively larger radius at a given @xmath20 . corresponding @xmath30 for swcnts is calculated to be 9.1 ev@xcite theoretically .",

    "is observed as the radius @xmath6 or @xmath20 decreases .",
    "this is an expected result , since the structure becomes more graphene - like with the increasing radius .",
    "calculated strain energies given by inset in fig.[fig : binding ] are also in agreement with the results obtained by fagan _ _ et al.__@xcite and barnard _ _ et al.__@xcite calculated value of the strain energy of a zigzag swsint is smaller than the strain energy of a zigzag swcnt having comparable radius.@xcite in classical theory of elasticity the strain ( or curvature ) energy of a tubular structure is given by the expression @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a function of youngs modulus and thickness of the tube s wall.@xcite result of the present calculations in fig.[fig : binding ] gives a fair fit to the expression , @xmath42 with @xmath43 .      radial flexibility is a criterion for the stability of tubular structure .",
    "swcnts are known to be flexible for the deformations in radial directions;@xcite they can sustain severe radial deformation transforming the circular cross section into an elliptical one with minor ( @xmath44 ) and major ( @xmath45 ) axis .",
    "the radial deformation on a bare tube of radius _ r _ is specified in terms of the strain associated with the pressing of the tube along the minor axis , @xmath46 and the strain associated with the expansion of the tube along the perpendicular major axis @xmath47 .",
    "theoretical and experimental research have shown that radially deformed tubes relax reversibly to original circular cross section whenever the external radial force is lifted.@xcite moreover , radial deformation can modify the electronic structure reversibly , that leads to a tunable band gap engineering.@xcite for example , a semiconducting ( _ n_,0 ) can be metallic under radial deformation .",
    "our results indicate that swsints display a behavior different than that of swcnts .",
    "we performed a systematic analysis of radial strain for ( 8,0 ) zigzag and ( 6,6 ) armchair swsints .",
    "first , these tubes have been deformed by applying @xmath48=-0.1,-0.2 and -0.3 . then the stress ( or constraint ) imposing these radial strains has been lifted and the structure has been optimized .",
    "contrary to situation in carbon nanotubes , up to the applied strain @xmath49 - 0.2 the swsints have remained in deformed state .",
    "for example , ( 8,0 ) tubes with initial radial strain of @xmath48=-0.1 and -0.2 are relaxed to a plastic deformation corresponding to @xmath48=-0.09 and @xmath48=-0.14 , respectively .",
    "similar results have been obtained for ( 6,6 ) armchair swsint with initial radial strain of @xmath48=-0.1 and -0.2 .",
    "in contrast , the tubes , which initially strained by @xmath48=-0.25 and -0.3 have relaxed to a state with negligible residual strain . the total energy of the undeformed swsint @xmath50 have been found to be lower ( more energetic ) than the total energy @xmath51(@xmath48 ) of tubes which were relaxed upon radial deformation @xmath52 .",
    "however , the energy difference @xmath53 is very small .",
    "the weakness of @xmath26-bonds of si as compared to carbon nanotubes is possibly a reason why the restoring forces are not strong enough to derive the deformed state to relax back to the original undeformed state .",
    "once the applied radial deformation gets significant ( @xmath54 ) the restoring forces become strong enough to derive the relaxation towards circular cross section . on the other hand , after a severe radial strain that causes to a significant coupling between opposite internal surfaces the deformed state may be more energetic ( _ i.e _ @xmath55 or it may relax to different structures such as clusters .",
    "this situation constitutes an important difference between si and c single - wall nanotubes .",
    "axial strength of swsint , or the elastic stiffness along tube axis is defined as the second derivative of the strain energy per atom with respect to the axial strain @xmath56 , namely @xmath57 .",
    "the elastic stiffness of the ( 8,0 ) swsint along its axis is calculated to be 23 ev .",
    "this value is significant , but smaller than that of swcnt which is calculated to be 52 - 60 ev.@xcite      a systematic analysis of electronic structure indicates that metallic zigzag swsints @xmath2 have three bands crossing the fermi level , but a band gap between valence and conduction bands opens when @xmath3 .",
    "similar effect has been obtained for zigzag swcnts when @xmath58.@xcite this metal - semiconductor transition was attributed to the energy shift of the singlet @xmath59-band which is normally empty , but becomes filled due to increased @xmath60 hybridization at small radius.@xcite in the present case it appears that @xmath60 hybridization becomes significant at relatively larger radius .",
    "the conductance of all these infinite , perfect tubes ( @xmath2 ) is predicted to be equal to @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "similar metallic behavior is also obtained for armchair types namely for ( 6,6 ) and ( 9,9 ) swsints .",

    "based on lda calculation fagan _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite also found ( 6,6 ) and ( 6,0 ) swsints metallic , but they predicted ( 10,0 ) and ( 12,0 ) zigzag nanotubes are semiconductor with a small band gap of 0.1 ev .",
    "the disagreement between the present one and those of fagan _ _ et al.__@xcite may be due to the differences in pseudopotentials and in the approximation of exchange correlation potential .",
    "note that the transition of @xmath11 swsints from metallic to semiconducting state through gap opening may occur at @xmath20 that is smaller than predicted by the present study as well by fagan _",
    "et al . _ , if self - energy correction are taken into account by gw method.@xcite electronic structure analysis performed for the tubes under strain both radially and axially showed that metallic character is not altered but only the position of fermi level slightly changed due to deformation .",

    "we found that si single - wall nanotubes with small radius are unstable and are clustered either at t=0 k or at finite temperatures .",
    "for example , while ( 3,0 ) is unstable even at t=0 k , ( 4,0 ) and ( 5,0 ) lose their tubular character and tend to form cluster at t=500 k. stable @xmath11 zigzag swsints are metallic for @xmath2 , but become semiconducting for @xmath91 .",
