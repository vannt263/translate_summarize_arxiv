    "one of the most interesting topics in solid state physics is the nature of the low - frequency ( 0.1 - 3 thz ) collective vibrations in glasses .",
    "while these frequencies are in the range of acoustic excitations , there are experimental evidences that the vibrations are not pure acoustic plane waves and their density of vibrational states @xmath5 does not follow the debye behavior ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a frequency ) .",
    "a maximum in @xmath8 that appears at some frequency @xmath2  is usually called the boson peak .",
    "vibrations around the boson peak can be studied by several experimental techniques : low - temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity @xcite , inelastic neutron @xcite and x - ray @xcite scattering , infrared absorption @xcite and raman scattering @xcite . in the case of the low - frequency raman spectroscopy",
    ", the density of vibrational states appears in the light scattering spectrum via the so - called light - vibration coupling coefficient , @xmath0 , @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the raman intensity for the stokes side of the spectrum , and @xmath11 is the bose factor .",
    "a knowledge of @xmath0  and an understanding of its frequency dependence have significant importance for the topic of the low - frequency vibrations .",
    "first of all , a knowledge of @xmath0 provides a relatively simple method to extract the vibrational density of states from a raman experiment .",
    "secondly , the light - vibration coupling coefficient contains information on the vibrational wavefunction @xcite and , therefore , can be used as a test of different models .",
    "two classical models suggested for the description of @xmath0  lead to different predictions : ( i ) shuker and gammon @xcite assumed that vibrations are localized on a distance much shorter than the light wavelength and predicted @xmath12 , while ( ii ) martin and brenig @xcite have demonstrated that a polarizability disorder mechanism applied to slightly damped acoustic waves leads to @xmath13 behavior at low frequencies and a peak at higher frequencies , related to a correlation length of the polarizability fluctuations .",
    "it was shown that quasi - plane acoustic waves with finite mean free path , @xmath14 , will also contribute to the low - frequency raman spectrum with @xmath15 , when @xmath16 , ref.@xcite , or with @xmath17 , when @xmath18 , ref.@xcite .",
    "there are a few challenges for experimental evaluation of the true vibration coupling coefficient : very low temperature data for both - raman spectra and @xmath5 - should be used in order to avoid a quasielastic contribution ( fast relaxation ) @xcite ; it is not obvious whether all vibrations at one frequency contribute to the raman spectra with the same @xmath0 , or there are different kinds of vibrations and each contributes with its own @xmath19 .",
    "a comparison of the low - temperature low - frequency raman spectra of glasses with the total @xmath5  obtained from low - temperature specific heat or inelastic neutron data has demonstrated that the coupling coefficient appears to vary nearly linearly with frequency @xcite .",
    "however , this comparison did not consider the possibility that two different kinds of vibrational excitations could co - exist around the boson peak .",
    "although most of the authors at present accept the idea that the vibrations around the boson peak are strongly hybridized and can not be easily separated , the question is not yet completely settled .",
    "this question became especially important in the light of the results of hyper - raman scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the existence of differences in the behavior of thz spectra in raman and hyper - raman scattering experiments was interpreted as evidence of the co - existence of two types of vibrational excitations .",
    "also , there are theoretical approaches describing the thz dynamics of glasses as a co - existence of two different types of vibrations in this spectral range ( for example , @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the raman coupling coefficient can lose its good physical meaning @xcite .",
    "one of the strong arguments in favor of the existence of a single type of vibrational excitation could be the universal behavior of @xmath0 for glasses with various structures .",
    "this universality suggests that the two hypothetical types of vibrations are interrelated .    a detailed analysis performed for silica glass",
    "has shown that @xmath0 varies linearly with frequency , @xmath20 in the range 10 - 50 @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this result was interpreted in @xcite as an evidence that the coupling coefficient extrapolates to a nonvanishing value in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the coupling coefficient demonstrates a superlinear behavior just below 10 @xmath21 , i.e. the observed linear behavior can not be extrapolated to zero frequency .",
    "it would be very important to know whether this behavior is general also for other glasses .",
    "the present contribution analyzes the frequency behavior of the coupling coefficient in a broad set of different glasses , strong and fragile , covalently and ionically bonded , low molecular weight and polymeric .",
    "it is shown that all glasses demonstrate the linear behavior of @xmath0 ( eq.([eq2 ] ) ) around the boson peak frequency .",
    "one of the most striking results is that there are two groups of glasses .",
    "one has a frequency independent contribution @xmath3 with a universal value @xmath23 , while the second group of glasses has @xmath24 .",
    "an interpretation of the results is proposed and a correlation with low - temperature thermal conductivity is found .",
    "the density of vibrational states must be known in order to extract the raman coupling coefficient ( see , eq.([eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that relaxation - like processes give significant contribution to the raman spectra and @xmath5 at frequencies below the boson peak even at temperatures as low as 50 k. thus , experimental data obtained at @xmath25 below 50 k should be used for extracting vibrational @xmath5 .",
    "two experimental techniques provide information on @xmath5 : inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and measurements of low - temperature specific heat @xcite .",
    "the latter has a few advantages : ( i ) the number of glasses for which specific heat data are available is much larger than the number of glasses for which inelastic neutron scattering data are available ; ( ii ) the density of states calculated from low - temperature specific heat data corresponds to a very low temperature , where usually no neutron data are available .",
    "while in the past only a phenomenological analysis was available for extraction of the coupling coefficient from the comparison of the specific heat and raman data ( for example , @xcite ) , recently it was shown that the integral equation for specific heat temperature dependence can be solved numerically and therefore the density of vibrational states may now be obtained from heat capacity measurements @xcite .    *",
    "sio*@xmath26*. * the low - temperature density of states of heralux silica glass was calculated from the specific heat data published in @xcite using the procedure described in details in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in this work that the density of states obtained from the specific heat data is in excellent agreement with the one measured by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite . low - temperature polarized raman data from heralux glass were taken from @xcite ( @xmath25= 7 k ) and depolarized data taken from @xcite ( @xmath25= 10 k ) .",
    "the raman coupling coefficient for the density of states evaluated from the specific heat data is in good agreement with that calculated from comparison of the raman and neutron data @xcite ( fig.1 ) .",
    "note that the deviation of @xmath0 of ref.@xcite in the high - frequency part is related to different kinds of silica glasses used for light and neutron scattering .",
    "the difference between the results reported in @xcite and those reported in @xcite at very low - frequencies is related to the presence of a quasielastic contribution at @xmath25= 50 k ( lowest temperature used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the range @xmath27 10 @xmath21 .",
    "this difference stresses the importance of using very low temperature data for estimates of the vibrational @xmath0 .",
    "fig.1 demonstrates ( see also the inset ) that in the frequency range 10 - 40 @xmath28 the coupling coefficient varies linearly with frequency , @xmath29 .",
    "the coupling coefficient is proportional to frequency in the range from 40 @xmath21 up to 120 @xmath21 .",
    "a superlinear behavior is observed below 10 @xmath21 . in the raman experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the signal in the range 7 - 8 @xmath21 was so weak that it was not possible to detect it . in this case only an estimate of the upper limit of the signal is available . this estimate was used for the calculation of the upper limit for @xmath0 at frequencies 7 - 8 @xmath21 .",
    "the open circles in fig .",
    "1 show the upper limit of the coupling coefficient ( for the polarized spectrum ) .",
    "thus , it is very likely , that the linear behavior of @xmath0 observed in @xcite is restricted to frequencies above 10 @xmath21 , but the coupling coefficient has another frequency dependence for @xmath7 10 @xmath21 .",
    "also it follows from the data of @xcite that @xmath0 increases faster than linear at @xmath7 10 @xmath21 .",

    "the raman spectrum of b@xmath30o@xmath31 glass corrected in this way ( by adjusting amplitude of the relaxational spectrum at the lowest points of the spectrum in fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) gives the coupling coefficient shown by the dotted line in fig.8 .",

    "the glasses in this class vary significantly in structure , fragility , and ratio of the excess vibrations to the debye level .",
    "there are many models that assume two different kinds of vibrations coexisting at frequencies around the boson peak : propagating and localized or quasilocal .",

    "the observed universality of @xmath0 , obtained using the total density of vibrational states ( figures 6,7 ) , supports an alternative idea that all vibrations around the boson peak are hybridized and can not be separated into propagating and localized .    in order to explain the observed universality of @xmath0",
    ", significant theoretical work should be done .",
    "there are two complications in this problem : ( i ) there is no good approximation for the wavefunction of the vibrations around the boson peak ; ( ii ) the scattering mechanism , i.e. the way how the vibrations modulate polarizability of the material , is not clear and might be different for different glasses .",
    "below we consider a very simplistic model that might provide a qualitative description of the observed universal behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "one possible explanation for this behavior can be found in the framework of the approach of non - continuous glass nanostructure @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the boson peak vibrations combine properties of both localized and extended excitations . at short distances ( inside of a nanocluster ) , displacements of atoms are coherent and the wavefunction is similar to a vibration localized in the cluster . at longer distances , however , the vibrations start to have diffusive character ( probably as in @xcite ) .",
    "note that the spirit of this consideration is very similar to that of the model in @xcite .    for simplicity of discussion we will follow continuous medium approximation @xcite . in this case the inelastic light scattering is caused by acoustic vibrations via the elasto - optic effect .",
    "the coupling coefficients for the raman scattering of acoustic - type excitations is written as@xcite : @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the strain of an acoustic vibration with frequency @xmath7 , @xmath70 means configurational and statistical averaging , and @xmath71 is the elasto - optic constant .",
    "cross - correlations of @xmath71 and @xmath69 fluctuations are neglected for simplicity .",
    "since the phonon mean free path is much shorter than the light wavelength , the exponential @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the scattering wavevector of the experiment ) is also neglected .",
    "the polarization indices are omitted for simplicity .",
    "we assume @xmath74 and neglect contribution of the fluctuating part of the elasto - optic constant in the raman coupling coefficient .    in the framework of the model considered , the integral of eq.([eq4 ] )",
    "can be separated into two parts : the first is for the short distances , where the wavefunction of the vibration mimics the localized feature ; the second one is for longer distances , where the wave function has diffusive character : @xmath75 here , @xmath76 is the radius of the nanocluster .",
    "the wavefuction in the first term behaves as a localized vibration and this is the case described in the shuker - gammon model @xcite .",
    "therefore , the first term is frequency independent .",
    "the diffusive character of the boson peak vibrations determines the frequency behavior of the second term in eq.([eq5 ] ) . in ref.@xcite , it was shown that the diffusive feature of acoustic vibrations leads to @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the second term in eq.([eq5 ] ) is proportional to frequency .",
    "thus , the localized - extended character of the boson peak vibrations may be the reason for the linear frequency dependence of the raman coupling coefficient .    according to eq.([eq5 ] ) , the relative contributions to @xmath0  of a frequency independent term and a term proportional to frequency reflects the relative weights of localized and extended part of the boson peak vibration .",
    "the result of fig.6 means that at the boson peak maximum the ratio of the localized and extended parts is the same for these glasses .    however , the frequency independent contribution to @xmath0 for some of glasses is negligibly small ( fig.7 ) . in the framework of the considered model ,",
    "it means that for these glasses either the vibrations have diffusive - like character even inside a nanocluster or this part of the wavefunction does not contribute to light scattering due to selection rules .",
    "we do not have a clear explanation for the observed difference and it remains a challenge for future investigations . at present",
    "we only show another hint that the peculiarity of type - ii glasses may be related to localization of the vibrations . indeed , if this is true one should expect that boson peak vibrations of type - ii glasses are more extended than those of type - i glasses .",
    "this difference has to show up in vibration transport properties .",
    "figure 9 presents the thermal conductivity of sio@xmath36 , ps , se , geo@xmath36 , pmma and as@xmath36s@xmath37 glasses ( data from refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the first three glasses are type - i and the next three are type - ii .",

    "it appears ( fig.9 ) that glasses of different type ( but of similar chemical nature ) have comparable thermal conductivity at higher t but type - ii glasses have higher thermal conductivity at the plateau .",
    "it is known that the plateau region in thermal conductivity corresponds to conductivity by vibrations around the boson peak .",
    "thus , this comparison reveals weaker localization of the boson peak vibrations in type - ii glasses and supports the above speculations .",
    "however , the question is far from settled and further investigations are needed in order to provide a microscopic explanation of the difference between the two types of glasses .",
    "there are no universalities in the frequency dependence of @xmath0 for @xmath77 .",
    "the high - frequency vibrations depend strongly on a particular atomic organization of a glass , its microstructure .",

    "an explanation for the observed @xmath0  is formulated in the framework of a model describing the vibrational wavefunction as a combination of localized and extended parts .",
    "we relate the difference in the behavior of @xmath0 in the two groups of glasses to different localization properties of the vibrations on a short length scale .",
    "this suggestion agrees with the observation of different behavior of thermal conductivity in these two types of glasses .",
    "it is also shown that @xmath0 has a superlinear behavior at frequencies below 0.3@xmath610.5@xmath80 .",
    "a sharp rise in mean free path of the vibrations with decrease in @xmath7  may be a reason for this fast decrease in @xmath0 .",
    "no universality is observed at higher frequencies ( above 2@xmath81 ) suggesting that the particular atomic organization of glasses is important in this spectral range .",
