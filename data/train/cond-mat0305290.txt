    "the existence of nondissipative supercurrents is a common feature of superconducting and superfluid systems . among various applications of superconductivity considerable attention",
    "was given to the use of superconducting circuits as very sensitive magnetometers ( superconducting quantum interferometer devices ) .",
    "at present an interest to such systems is renewed in view of a possibility to use superconducting circuits with weak links as elements of quantum computers ( josephson qubits ) .",
    "basing on a similarity between superfluids and superconductors one can expect that the former ones may also be used for implementing qubits .",
    "supercurrent in superconductors is coupled to vector potential of electromagnetic fields .",
    "it allows to control persistent current states by external fields . obviously , there is no such a channel for a control in uncharged superfluid bose systems . in this paper",
    "we study another possibility based on a nondissipative drag effect .",
    "the drag in normal systems has been investigated experimentally and theoretically by many authors ( see , for instance , reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the main attention was given to the study of bilayer electron systems in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "in such systems an interlayer drag effect takes place .",
    "the effect is caused by electron - electron scattering processes and it reveals itself in an appearance of a drag voltage in one layer when a normal current flows in the adjacent layer .",
    "if the former layer is in a closed circuit , the drag voltage induces a drag current flowing through the circuit .",
    "the effect is accompanied by a dissipation of energy and takes place only at finite temperatures .",
    "roughly , the drag voltage increases by the @xmath0-law ( deviation from this law , observed experimentally @xcite , is connected with a phonon contribution to the interaction between the carriers @xcite ) .    in superfluid and superconducting systems",
    "another kind of drag may take place .",
    "this drag is nondissipative and is connected with a redistribution of a supercurrent between two superfluid ( superconducting ) components . in difference with the drag in a normal state",
    "the superfluid drag has the largest value at zero temperatures and decreases under increasing the temperature . on the existence of nondissipative drag in superfluid systems",
    "was pointed out for the first time in the paper by andreev and bashkin @xcite . in this paper a three - velocity hydrodynamic model of a @xmath1he-@xmath2he mixture",
    "was developed .",
    "it has been shown that superfluid behavior of such systems can be described under accounting the `` drag ''  term in the free energy .",
    "this term is proportional to the scalar product of superfluid velocities of two components times the difference between the effective and the bare masses of @xmath1he atoms . in the paper by duan and yip @xcite",
    "the nondissipative drag effect in superconductors has been studied .",
    "the authors of @xcite argue that the value of drag can be obtained from the energy of zero - point fluctuations .",
    "it was shown that this energy contains a `` drag '' term analogous to one obtained in @xcite in the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "the theory of the nondissipative drag in a bilayer system of charged bosons was developed by tanatar and das @xcite and by terentjev and shevchenko @xcite .",
    "the existence of nondissipative drag in a system of two one - dimensional wires in a persistent current state was predicted by rojo and mahan @xcite .",
    "it was also shown by duan @xcite that nondissipative drag is responsible for an emergence of an interlayer hall voltage in bilayer electron systems in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "basing on the previous studies one can consider nondissitive drag as a fundamental property of systems with macroscopic quantum coherence . for the system of uncharged bosons this effect is especially important , since the `` drag force '' plays the role similar to the role of the vector potential of magnetic field in superconductors .",
    "it opens new possibilities to observe the effects caused by phase coherence in such systems .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to point out on this analogy . in particular , we show that the nondissipative drag effect allows to realize an entangled flux state in a superfluid ring with a weak josephson link .",
    "now a great attention is given to the study of ultracold alkali - metal vapours confined in magnetic and optical traps , where bose - einstein condensation of atoms was observed @xcite .",
    "advances in technology allow to manipulate parameters of such systems and make ultracold atomic gases an unique object for the study of various quantum mechanical phenomena .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of nondissipative drag in a system of two quasi two - dimensional atomic bose gases confined in two parallel traps .",
    "to describe such a situation we take into account that densities of atoms in the drive and the drag layers can be non - equal . in previous studies",
    "@xcite only the case of two layers with equal densities of the particles was considered .",
    "another important factor is the temperature . in atomic gases",
    "it is of order or higher than the energy of intralayer interactions .",
    "previously , the dependence of nondissipative drag on the temperature was treated only qualitatively @xcite .",
    "here we study the temperature dependence quantitatively .",
    "we also evaluate the value of the drag for concrete mechanisms of interlayer interaction in atomic bose gases .",
    "the geometry of the bose cloud can be modified significantly under a variation of a configuration of external fields forming a trap .",
    "when the confining potential is strongly anisotropic and the temperature as well as the chemical potential are smaller than the separation between the energy levels of spatial quantization in one direction the bose gas can be treated as a two - dimensional one .",
    "recently , low - dimensional atomic gases were realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "bose clouds of a ring shape can be created by using toroidal traps .",
    "a configuration of two toroidal traps situated one above another is convenient for the study of the drag effect . as it follows from the further consideration",
    "if one excites a circulating superflow in one trap it inevitably leads to a redistribution of this superflow between two traps and superfluid currents appear in both rings .",
    "main features of the drag effect can be understood from the study of a system of two uniform two - dimensional bose gases situated in parallel layers .",

    "it results in a modification of the spectrum of elementary excitations .",
    "we may argue that this modification reveals itself in only minor changes of the value of the drag .",
    "one can find that the main contribution to the sum in eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) comes from the excitations with the wave vectors of order or higher than the inverse healing lengths @xmath104 . in systems with the healing lengths",
    "much smaller than the linear size of the bose clouds the spectrum at @xmath105 is well described by the quasi uniform approximation .",
    "therefore , in such systems the local drag current is given by the same equations ( [ 29])-([32 ] ) , as in the uniform case with the only modification that the densities @xmath106 , @xmath107 in these formulas should be understood as the functions of @xmath11 . in particular , we predict , that for two bose gases confined in harmonic traps having the same thomas - fermi radius ( and this radius is much larger than the average healing length ) a spatial distribution of the superflow in the drag trap @xmath89 will replicate ( with a drag factor ) the spatial distribution of the superflow in the drive trap .",
    "at finite temperatures one can expect a reduction of the drag factor near the edge of the bose cloud , where the density is small .",
    "one can ask to which extent two - dimensionality of the system studied may influence on the results obtained .",
    "it is known that in 2d systems fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter are large and at nonzero temperature the off - diagonal one - particle density matrix @xmath108 goes to zero in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "it means the absence of the long range order in the systems at @xmath110 .",
    "but since the asymptotic behavior of the density matrix are described by a power - law dependence on @xmath111 ( not an exponential one ) , at temperatures lower than the critical one ( the kosterlits - touless transition temperature ) the superfluid density becomes nonzero .",
    "the drag of the superflow between two 2d bose - gases , considered in the paper , is connected with a finite value of the superfluid density and that is why it decreases under increasing the temperature . the density and phase operator approach , used in this paper ,",
    "is not based on the existence of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "moreover , the power - law asymptotic behavior of the density matrix can be easily derived in this approach under accounting the thermal excitations described by the hamiltonian @xmath112 .",
    "but at the same level of approximation we do not find any crucial influence of the two - dimensionality on the drag phenomena .",

    "( [ 53 ] ) and expanding the final expression in powers of the phase gradients we find the following expression for the free energy @xmath199 + \\textrm{higher order    terms},\\ ] ] where @xmath200 does not depend on the phase gradients and the quantities @xmath71 , @xmath88 are determined by the expressions ( [ 31]),([32 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the answer ( [ 29])-([32 ] ) obtained in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] by another method can also be found from eq .",
    "( [ 55 ] ) using the relation @xmath201    the relation ( [ 55 ] ) is more instructive in a sense that it demonstrates an analogy between the drag effect in superfluids and the exciting of a supercurrent by an external magnetic field in superconductors . to illustrate this analogy",
    "let us consider two ring - shape traps and fix the phase gradient in the drive trap ( trap 2 in further notations ) .",
    "then the free energy as the function of the phase gradient in the drag trap ( trap 1 ) can be presented in the form @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the radius of the ring , @xmath204 , its width , @xmath205 , @xmath206 ( here @xmath207 is a contour around the ring ) is the winding number for the phase @xmath208 and @xmath209 is the winding number for the phase @xmath210 times the drag factor . in deriving ( [ 57 ] )",
    "we , for simplicity , neglect the dependence of densities on the coordinate inside the traps .",
    "since the value of @xmath211 should be integer the minimum of the free energy at @xmath212 is reached for @xmath213 . in this case",
    "the phase gradient in the drag trap is equal to zero and the superfluid current in the drag trap flows in the same direction as in the drive trap .",
    "if @xmath214 the free energy reaches its minimum at nonzero @xmath211 and the phase gradient is induced in the drag trap .",
    "then together with the drag current the counterflow current appears in the drag trap ( depending on the value of @xmath215 the total current in this trap can be parallel as well as antiparallel to the current in the drag trap ) .",
    "just the same situation takes place in a superconducting ring with nonzero flux of magnetic field inside the ring .",
    "thus , in two - ring bose systems the quantity @xmath216 plays the same role as a flux of an external magnetic field ( measured in units of flux quanta ) in superconducting circuits .",
    "to realize this situation experimentally one should create a circulating superflow in the drive trap .",
    "it can be done by elliptic rotating deformation of this trap .",
    "the rotation can be switched of when a superflow be created .",
    "the value of drag current can be found from measurement of the angular momentum of the drag trap . at present",
    "a number methods for measuring this quantity has been realized experimentally @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the methods are based on the study of dynamics of collective excitations , on the investigation of interference phemonena under hyperfine state transitions and on the observation of the dynamics of expansion of the bose cloud .    to extend the analogy with superconductors",
    "let us consider the case where the drag trap of a ring geometry contains a weak josephson link .",
    "then the free energy as the function of the phase shift @xmath217 on the link reads as @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the josephson energy . at @xmath220 and @xmath221 the dependence @xmath222 has two degenerate minima .",
    "if @xmath223 these minima are very shallow and one can expect that two quantum states with different phase shifts ( and with the superfluid currents flowing in opposite directions ) will be entangled . it is the same regime that is required for implementing the superconducting josephson flux ( persistent current ) qubit @xcite . while in alkali - metal bose gases the drag factor is rather small and even in the most favorable conditions the maximum value can be reached is of order @xmath224 ( see sec .",
    "[ s4 ] ) , the case @xmath225 can be realized in ring - shape traps of large radiuses ( @xmath226 @xmath227 m ) .    in conclusion , we would like to mention another systems in which the effects described in this paper may take place .",
    "it is excitonic or electron - hole bose liquids in electron bilayers . in these systems",
    "electron - hole pairs with components belonging to adjacent layers may form a superfluid state .",
    "for the first time the effect was predicted in @xcite , and recently it was confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the superfluid drag effect may emerge in two parallel bilayers ( the four - layer system ) . in the four - layer system",
    "the intralayer ( in the same bilayer ) and interlayer ( between bilayers ) interactions are of the same order : both of them are determined by the dipole - dipole mechanism .",
    "in such a case the dipole momentum of the pair is large .",
    "therefore , one can expect that nondissipative drag in these systems will be rather strong .",
