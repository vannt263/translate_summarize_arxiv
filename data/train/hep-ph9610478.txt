    "the factorization approximation is widely used in the heavy quark physics . as a calculational scheme ,",
    "it is very convenient and there are numerous models based on it .",
    "however , the theoretical basis for the approximation itself is not completely understood . the usual motivation for it is a color transparency argument due to bjorken @xcite which suggests that the quark pair produced in the decay does not have enough time to evolve to the real - size hadronic entity , being a small size bound state with a small chromomagnetic moment .",
    "that is taken to imply that the qcd interaction is suppressed .",
    "for the heavy - to - heavy - light transition ( we shall hereafter refer to the color allowed decay @xmath0 for the sake of clarity ) the matrix elements in question are @xmath1 here the usual notations are used @xmath2 where we have explicitly written out color indices . in the usual factorization approximation one",
    "simply separates out currents by inserting the vacuum state and disregards any qcd interactions between them on the basis of bjorken s conjecture .",
    "that implies that the @xmath3 contribution in ( [ firfor ] ) is dropped , as it has no factorizable color singlet form .",
    "new non - factorizable corrections appearing in the @xmath3 matrix element can arise if a hard or soft gluon is emitted or absorbed by the escaping pair .",
    "obviously , a more quantitative estimate of these contributions is needed .",
    "the first attempt to put a factorization approximation on the solid theoretical base was made in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a limit of large energy transferred to light quarks @xmath4 as @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the velocity of the decaying heavy quark @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the momentum transferred to the light quark pair . in this limit",
    "the energy scales as a heavy quark mass . proposing a large energy effective theory ( leet ) as an extension of the heavy quark effective theory and making use of a convenient gauge condition @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 being a null vector , @xmath11=0 ) they proved factorization for the physical amplitude dominated by collinear quarks .",
    "it is not clear , however , how the pair of collinear quarks hadronizes into the pion .",
    "also , the validity of the leet itself is not yet established .",
    "the important step towards the sought theoretical description was made in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a specific small velocity limit where @xmath12 which implies different scaling of ( [ energy ] ) : @xmath13 as @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that this limit is theoretically `` clean '' for the application of the qcd sum rule method and provides a theoretical justification of the `` rule of discarding @xmath14 corrections '' @xcite on dynamical grounds .",
    "unfortunately , the actual @xmath15 decays are at the borderline of the formalism , bringing large uncertainties into the estimation of the matrix elements .    in what follows",
    "we develop a qcd - based model which works in the limit @xmath16 as @xmath5 .",
    "the idea is to study the propagation of the light quarks emerging to form the final hadron while passing through the ( perturbative or non - perturbative ) gluonic fields present in the decay .",
    "interestingly , results can be obtained which are independent of the nature of the gluonic fields .",
    "the light quark pair , produced at @xmath17 , interacts strongly with the background gluonic field while escaping from the point they were produced and hadronizes into the pion . since the energy transferred to the quark pair is large it is not necessary that the hadronization occurs at @xmath18 . as a result , it is not sufficient to take the operators of the lowest dimension in the operator product expansion ( ope ) but rather one must sum up a whole series of operators .",
    "the novel technical point of our method is to use introduce `` generating ( distribution ) functions '' which incorporate this infinite series of matrix elements , and then to use heavy quark symmetry to restrict the form of the matrix elements enough that useful statements can be made . in principle , these functions could be modeled or perhaps fixed by other measurements . however , at the leading order in @xmath19 the color octet matrix element vanishes due to cancellations and factorization holds .",
    "the method should be able to be extended beyond leading order , allowing one to also see corrections to factorization .",
    "the amplitude for the singlet or octet part is      with @xmath21 being the appropriate color matrix .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 describes the transition of the light quarks into a pion in the presence of the gluonic fields which are either internal to the b , d hadrons or produced during the transition .",
    "the idea is to treat these gluonic fields as external fields with respect to the light quark pair produced in the decay of virtual @xmath23-meson . from the diagrams fig.1",
    "one may write down the expression for one gluon matrix element of the produced quark pair in this general background field .",
    "this gives a contribution to the octet matrix element only :      where we set @xmath25 = the external field .",
    "as one can see , in this approximation we neglect higher fock state contributions .",
    "our normalization is such that @xmath26 .",
    "thus we can rewrite the equation ( [ onegluon ] ) as @xmath27 with non - local correlators @xmath28 shifting the @xmath29-dependence of the second correlator @xmath30 we shall work in the fock - shwinger gauge @xcite which gives us the advantage of expressing the @xmath31 in terms of gauge - invariant quantities ( such as the gluon stress tensor @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 we treat the light quarks as massless , so the bare propagator of a light quark is given by @xmath34 this allows us to rewrite ( [ onegl ] ) as      the correlator @xmath36 entering the expression above is non - perturbative and nonlocal but can be related to the wave function of the forming pion . following @xcite",
    "we expand it near the light cone ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the general form of expansion is      with @xmath39 being the full set of dirac matrices .",
    "we would like to note , however , that since @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) contributes to the trace , only @xmath42 and @xmath43 terms enter the final expression for @xmath44 . in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) , the non - gauge invariant terms are exactly zero by the fs gauge condition ( [ amu ] ) which allows us to use analysis similar to @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this gauge @xmath45 in ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "thus ,      parameterizing unknown matrix elements in the conventional form @xmath47 where @xmath8 is a momentum of the pion we arrive at the simple form for the @xmath48-correlators @xmath49 with the function @xmath50 introduced through its moments @xmath51 the zeroth moment gives the overall normalization of @xmath50 : @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the decay constant of @xmath54-meson . inserting ( [ gcorr ] ) into",
