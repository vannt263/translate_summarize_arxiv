    "several theoretical implementations for a quantum mechanical engine have been reported , such as entangled states in a qubit @xcite , quantum mechanical versions of the otto cycle @xcite , photocells @xcite and a strained single - layer graphene flake @xcite . in recent years",
    ", it has been proposed that if the reservoirs are also of a quantum mechanical nature , these could be engineered into quantum coherent states @xcite or into squeezed thermal states @xcite , thus allowing for a theoretical enhancement of the engine efficiency beyond the classical carnot limit @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest theoretical implementations for a quantum mechanical engine is a system composed of one or more particles trapped in a one dimensional potential well @xcite .",
    "the different processes can be driven by a quasi - static deformation of the potential well by applying an external force .",

    "@xcite lead many studies and publications under that considered replacing the heat baths with energy baths .",
    "the basic idea of this possibility is that the expectation value of the energy is a quantity well defined in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting studies in a isoenergetic cycle is the scheme of optimization proposed by abe @xcite , which consist of the possibility the well width s movement speed finite in analogy to making the speed of the piston finite in the context of the finite - time thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this study is extended in the publication of wang et al .",

    "the generalization of this problem , @xmath1 fermions in @xmath2 levels , is presented in ref .",

    ", we study the possibility to using a taylor series to the power of @xmath3 , in which @xmath4 is the compton wave length and @xmath5 is the width of the potential , to find an solution to the contribution for the first relativistic order correction for two particles and three levels for one dimensional box and show how it affects the calculation of the optimization region .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this work is the first attempt to combine two power - law spectrum in the literature in the context of optimal analysis for a quantum mechanical engine . in spite of that several approximation",
    "must be made to obtain relevant physical information .",
    "another important limit of theoretical interest is the ultra - relativistic case whose spectrum energy is proportional to @xmath6 in contrast of the schrdinger spectrum which is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the discussion of this last case will allow us to enrich the results and conclusions we obtain for the first order correction .",
    "the problem of a dirac particle in the presence of a one - dimensional , finite potential well @xmath8 is expressed by the dirac hamiltonian operator @xcite , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 are dirac matrices in 4 dimensions , with @xmath11 the pauli matrices .",
    "the domain of this operator is @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the hilbert space of ( complex - valued ) 4-component spinors @xmath14 , where each component @xmath15 is therefore a square - integrable function in the unbounded domain @xmath16 .",
    "the mathematical and physical pictures are given by considering the singular limit of an _ infinite _ potential well , @xmath17    the singular character of the infinite potential well , which is the same as that in the more familiar schrdinger case @xcite , requires a different mathematical statement of the problem .",
    "one must to define a self - adjoint extension @xcite of the _ free _ hamiltonian particle @xmath18 whose domain @xmath19 is a dense proper subset of the hilbert space @xmath20 of square - integrable ( complex - valued ) 4-component spinors in the closed interval @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "in general , the domain of @xmath22 and its adjoint @xmath23 verify @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , physics requires that @xmath22 be self - adjoint .",
    "the self - adjoint extension is obtained by imposing appropriate boundary conditions @xcite on the spinors at the boundary @xmath25 of the finite domain @xmath26 and in the use of a fundamental discrete symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian ( parity ) , as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "this approach provide a physically acceptable spinor - eigenfunctions , given by @xmath27 with associated discrete energy eigenvalues , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the compton wavelength .",
    "the positive sign corresponds to the particle solution @xcite .",
    "two important limits can be obtained for this spectrum ; one correspond to the case when @xmath30 @xmath31 with @xmath32 being to the solution of the well - know schrdinger problem .",
    "the other important limit of eq.([eq5 ] ) corresponds to a massless dirac particle with @xmath33 , where the spectrum reduces to the expression @xmath34 this situation may be of interest in graphene systems , where conduction electrons in the vicinity of the so - called dirac point can be described as effective massless chiral particles , satisfying dirac s equation in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "through this work , we describe a very special type of dynamics , where we shall assume that one or more physical parameters in the set @xmath35 ( such as geometrical dimensions in this case ) , on which the hamiltonian @xmath36 depends explicitly , can be varied at an arbitrary slow rate @xmath37 . to be more precise , let us assume that @xmath38 constitutes the set of a eigenvectors of @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents a set of indexes that labels the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",

    "is associated with the energy exchange , while the second one represents the work done .",
    "that is , energy exchange between a quantum mechanical system and its surroundings is induced by transition between quantum states of the systems , in which the temperature ( heat bath ) is included or not , while the work is performed due to the variation of energy spectrum with fixed occupation probabilities . the quasi - static process described above via eq.([eq12aa ] ) can be considered as a very particular form of a dynamical process , provided two main assumptions are made : first , the dynamics is uniquely determined by the rate of change of the set parameters @xmath52 , such that in a given interval of time @xmath53 we have @xmath54 . in the second place the rates must be slow enough in order to satisfy that the quantity @xmath55 must be considerably higher compared with the relaxation times of the system and reservoir @xcite .    as in a classical system , we define a generalized force @xmath56 . for this case ,",
    "the external force driving the change in the width of the potential well must be equal to the  internal pressure \" of one dimensional system , @xmath57",
    "in our case , we have only one parameter in the set @xmath35 , corresponding to the case of the width of the potential well , @xmath5 . an arbitrary state @xmath58 can be expanded in terms of the eigenstates @xmath59 as @xmath60 , with the expansion coefficients satisfying @xmath61 .",
    "the working substance of our quantum mechanical engine consists of two non - interacting relativistic particles in a system of three possible levels operating under a isoenergetic cycle .",
    "so , along the paper we shall assume that there are only three states @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 with @xmath65 , and @xmath66 with @xmath67 employed by the quantum mechanical engine model with two particles .",
    "the isoenergetic cycle , a scheme for a quantum mechanical engine originally proposed by bender et al .",
    "@xcite , is composed by two isoentropic and two isoenergetic processes . in particular , during the isoenergetic processes , the  working substance \" must exchange energy with an energy reservoir @xcite , keeping constant the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "so , to realize this process , the work done by the external parameter @xmath68 , on which hamiltonian of the quantum system depends parametrically , can be precisely counterbalanced . in the isoenergetic process",
    "the quantum system evolves from initial state @xmath69 to a final state @xmath70 through a unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , one possibility to satisfy the constancy of the expectation value of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath71+\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}=i\\hbar\\left[h\\left(t\\right ) , h\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]+\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial \\mu}\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial t}=0 $ ] .",
    "a possible practical realization of this cycle was proposed in several works @xcite , where the working substance exchanges energy with an external field , which acts as an energy reservoir and plays the role of heat baths in a traditional quantum heat engine @xcite . during the isoenergetic stage ,",
    "the energy exchange between a quantum mechanical system and its surroundings induced transitions between the quantum states of the system . currently an isoenergetic process is not very easy to be realized in experiments , but is not the case in numerical simulations @xcite . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume that the final state after the isoenergetic process correspond to the maximal expansion ( compression ) , that is , the particles end completely localized in the closest upper ( lower ) levels . on the other hand , during the isoentropic process , the occupation probabilities @xmath72 do not change .",
    "then , no transition occurs between levels during this process , consequently no energy is exchanged between the system and the energy bath during this stage .",
    "the scheme of this work is illustrated in the fig [ fig1 ] . during the first stage ,",
    "@xmath73 the width of the potential expands slowly , and the expectation of the hamiltonian , @xmath74 remains constant .",
    "the total energy of the system can be rewritten as @xmath75 where we change the index @xmath41 to @xmath76 , and @xmath1 represents the total number of particles in your quantum system .",
    "unfortunately , this series does not have an analytical expression as found in the schrdinger problem @xcite , @xmath77 where @xmath78 . using the notation of the work @xcite",
    ", the normalization condition for the particles can be written in the form @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the expansion coefficients of @xmath76th particle occupying the @xmath41th eigenstate .",
    "we can then write the energy of the system as a function of @xmath5 for the case of the relativistic spectrum in eq.([eq5 ] ) as follows @xmath81 where @xmath2 represents the energy - level number .",
    "the condition of energy conservation along the isoenergetic process @xmath73 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , imply that the eq.([eq16 ] ) must be equal to eq.([eq14 ] ) . from this equality",
    "we obtain a relationship between the coefficients and the width of the potential well which it is used to simplify the expression    @xmath82    which corresponds to the force determined by the eq.([eq11 ] ) and eq.([eq16 ] ) . in this case",
    "we obtain a relationship between the coefficients and the width of the potential well is not as simple as in a case of a single power - law spectrum @xcite . however , the physical interest of this work focuses on found the relativistic correction of the work presented @xcite . to do that , we work with the first order correction of the spectrum given in the eq.([eq5 ] ) , and we develop the isoenergetic cycle using a combination of power - law spectrum ( @xmath83 ) , considering the case of @xmath84 and @xmath85 . on the other hand ,",
    "we achieve interesting results when we take the ultra - relativistic limit and compare the results with the first order relativistic correction previously developed .",
    "for this case we can use a taylor series up to order @xmath86 for the spectrum of the eq.([eq5 ] ) considering @xmath87 . in all our calculations , the expression for the physical observables contain the expression @xmath88 , but for notational reason we do not explicit this term into the manuscript .",
    "the initial condition for the cycle under this approach is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is given in the equation eq.([eq15 ] ) and @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath84 we obtain the values @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "for this restriction we do not have a simply relation as one might expect between @xmath5 and the coefficients .",
    "however , we found a solution of physical interest ( see appendix a for details ) for the force throughout the process which is given by : @xmath97 where we define for simplicity @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    under the context of maximal expansion , when @xmath100 , the first particle is in the first excited state @xmath101 , and the second particle is in the second excited state ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the energy at that point can be rewritten as @xmath103 the isoenergetic condition for a maximal expansion required to equalize the eq.([eq19 ] ) with eq.([eq23 ] ) implies an equation in the form @xmath104 where we define @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "the third process corresponds to isoenergetic compression from @xmath113 until @xmath117 . as with the first process , the key point",
    "is the fact that the expectation value of the hamiltonian is constant along the trajectory and is given by @xmath118 using the same treatment to constrain the force as we used in the first isoenergetic process(see appendix a for details ) , we found that the force throughout this process can be expressed as follows : @xmath119    in the context of maximal compression , the first particle now returns to the ground state @xmath120 and the second one goes to the first excited state @xmath121 .",

    "one of the points treated in the works @xcite is the study of the efficiency at maximum power for the case of different working substance operating between two energy baths under isoenergetic conditions with a constant leakage between the baths .",
