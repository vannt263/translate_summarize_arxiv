    "the connection between classical and quantum physics has always been tantalizing and elusive .",
    "the establishment of quantization rules for classical system has been the algorithmic method which dominated the construction of quantum systems .",
    "this pathway has been plagued with surprises : existence of quantum anomalies , operator ordering problems , quantum divergences , spontaneous symmetry breaking , renormalization of couplings and observables , etc .",
    "the way back to classical mechanics from quantum dynamics has revealed also problematic due to the failure of semiclassical expansion and the existence of quantum states without a natural classical analogue .",
    "one of the most explicit realizations of the genuine differences between classical and quantum systems is provided by the analysis of boundary conditions in systems evolving in constrained spaces @xcite . however",
    ", this mismatch has been very useful to introduce new quantum inspired classical structures : quantum groups , non - commutative geometry , etc .    in this note",
    "we explore the analogies and differences between the equivalences of classical and quantum systems from a spectral point of view .",
    "there is a natural equivalence relation between classical mechanical systems based on the analysis of the periods of closed orbits and its dependence on the orbit energy .",
    "two bounded mechanical systems might be considered equivalent if they employ the same time periods for closed orbits with the same energy , and then they are said to be isoperiodic .",
    "this equivalence relation was introduced by abel in 1826 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the equivalence classes of equivalent potentials include potentials related by shear transformations but this does not exhaust all possibilities as we will show below .",
    "this fact is related with the concept of steiner symmetrization which was used in @xcite to establish that all potentials with only one minimum having the same steiner symmetrized potential have the same dependence of periods on the energy @xmath3 .",
    "another open problem is the characterization of all potentials which give rise to isochronous motions , i.e. the period does not depend on the energy ( see e.g. , and references therein ) .",
    "the origin of the problem is even older , it goes back to huygens in 1673 @xcite . in the one - dimensional case with rational potentials",
    "it can be shown that the only symmetric isochronous potentials with a constant period @xmath4 correspond either to the harmonic oscillator @xmath5 or to the isotonic potential of the form @xmath6 , up to a translation @xcite .",
    "there is a similar equivalence relation for quantum systems .",
    "two quantum systems with bounded classical analogs are said to be spectrally equivalent if their energy levels are identical .",
    "it is well known that the isoperiodicity equivalence is the classical version of the quantum isospectrality condition ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a recent discussion ) . in the same way it is obvious",
    "that the quantum counterpart of isochronicity is the harmonic spectrum ( for regular potentials ) .",
    "however , there is not a theorem characterizing the potentials with equally spaced energy levels in an analogous way as for the isochronous systems . in particular",
    ", we shall show the existence of many isochronous classical systems which do not have equally spaced quantum energy spectra .",
    "more generally , the classical equivalence associated to isoperiodicity is not always preserved by the quantization process , i.e. given two isoperiodic classical systems the corresponding quantum systems might not be isospectral .",
    "the exploration of the anomalies of this correspondence is one of the goals of this paper . in particular",
    ", we will exhibit many isochronous classical systems which do not have equally spaced quantum energy spectra .",
    "conversely , we will also show that there are spectrally equivalent quantum systems which are not classically isoperiodic .",
    "in the path integral approach to quantum mechanics the anomaly can be understood by the simple fact that the contribution of paths which do not correspond to classical solutions of motion equations give different contributions for some isoperiodic potentials .",
    "however , the equivalence between isoperiodic classical systems is not broken in the semiclassical approximation @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the quantum anomalies , when they exist , can only appear in higher order corrections @xmath0 .",
    "isoperiodic deformations of an potential are of two types : shear transformations and time - space scale transformations .",
    "the difference between both deformations is that in the first case the energy of the orbits is preserved whereas in the second case the energy levels are scaled .",
    "the quantum anomaly in the first case can be interpreted as an obstruction to the shear transformation which requires an additional amount of energy to be performed unlike for the classical systems . on the contrary",
    ", the scale transformation always involves energy transfer in both cases .",
    "one of the main results of the paper is the proof that the full characterization of isoperiodic rational potentials can be achieved in terms of translations , reflections and joukowski transformations .    on the other hand , there are quantum mechanical systems whose potentials are related by a darboux transformation that implies that they have ( almost ) identical energy spectra .",
    "some of those systems turn out to be classically isoperiodic but some others do not .",
    "these facts illuminate the relations existing between quantum isospectrality and classical isoperiodicity , two similar but not identical dynamical concepts .",
    "the analysis of these equivalences at the classical and quantum levels provides a very illuminating picture of the quantum / classical transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we analyze the notion of isoperiodicity and provide a characterization of polynomial isochronous potentials .",
    "the generalization of abel s theory for singular potentials is approached in section 3 , where we prove the main results of the paper concerning the characterization of isoperiodic rational potentials which are illustrated with some illuminating examples . in section 4",
    "we analyze the role of scale invariance in the analysis of isoperiodicity .",
    "the quantum analogue of isoperiodicity is isospectrality .",
    "the appearance of anomalies in the quantization of isoperiodic potentials prevents the isospectrality of some isoperiodic potentials , although their first order semiclassical corrections are identical .",
    "this is shown in section 5 while in section 6 we analyze the opposite case , where we analyze some isospectral potentials related by darboux transforms which are not classically isoperiodic .",
    "the complete identification of all potentials of one - dimensional mechanical systems giving rise to the same dependence @xmath3 of the period @xmath7 of recurrent trajectories with an energy @xmath8 was provided by abel @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this classification can also be obtained by identifying the deformations of the potential that do not change the @xmath3 dependence .",

    "having in mind the invariance under translations , we can assume in the simplest case , the asymptotic behavior @xmath14 and that @xmath15 has two branches ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two monotone decreasing / increasing functions , i.e. such that @xmath19 .",

    "the time - evolution of one - dimensional systems is described in terms of the potential function @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath156 . if we introduce a change of space - time coordinates defined by x= x , t= t , [ scale ] where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are positive real numbers , then the equation of motion becomes = - ( ) ( x ) and therefore , if we define @xmath159 we find that the equation of motion reads = - .",
    "this invariance of the equation of motion is a consequence of the transformation of the action : s(x)=dt ( ^2 - u(x)),=s .",
    "this suggests to study the relation between systems described by potentials @xmath15 and @xmath160 related as in equation ( [ utilde ] ) .",
    "we introduce next a generalization of a property studied by dorignac @xcite .",
    "let @xmath161 an arbitrary function and define i_(e)=_x_-(e)^x_+(e ) ( e - u(x ) ) dx  .",
    "if for any pair of real numbers @xmath162 we define a new potential given by u(x)= ( ) u ( x ) , then x_(e)=1 x _ ( ) , and consequently i_(e)=_x_-(e)^x_+(e ) ( e - u(x ) ) dx  .",
    "therefore , i_(e)=_(1/)x -(^2 e/^2)^(1/)x+(^2 e/^2)(e- u ( x))dx= 1_x_-(^2 e/^2)^x_+(^2 e/^2)(e- u(y ) ) dy , and defining e= the equation can be rewritten as i_(e)=1_x_-(e)^x_+(e ) ( ( ^2/^2)(e - u(y ) ) dy . if the function @xmath163 is homogeneous of degree @xmath164 , i_(e)= i_(e ) .",
    "when computing the period of an oscillating motion we find a function as @xmath165 with @xmath166 a function proportional to @xmath167 and when computing the action we arrive to a function @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , i__p(e)=1 i__p(e ) , i__a(e)= i__a(e ) .    as a consequence",
    "if @xmath13 is an isochronous potential with period @xmath62 , then @xmath169 is isochronous too and its period is @xmath170 . in particular , for @xmath171 we obtain that if @xmath13 is an isochronous potential with period @xmath62 , then @xmath172 is isochronous too with the same frequency @xcite .    in particular , for @xmath173",
    "we see that if @xmath174 is an isochronous potential , then @xmath175 is isochronous too and with the same period . on the contrary ,",
    "the action for this potential @xmath160 is not the same as for @xmath15 , and if the spectrum of the first one is equispaced , it will not be true for the new potential .    in many cases",
    "the above scale transformation can be shown to be equivalent to a shear transformation , e.g. in some of the examples of the previous section are related by scale transformations .",
    "however , the scale transformation has a different nature .",
    "it establishes an equivalence relation among isoperiodic potentials but does not preserve the energy levels unlike the shear transformation .",
    "for such a reason one does not expect that quantization will preserve the equivalence at the spectral level .    in physical terms",
    "the scale transformation has a energy cost whereas the classical shear transformation is energy preserving .",
    "an interesting question is to know whether or not the quantization prescription preserves this classical property",
    ". this will be the subject of next section .",
    "it is clear from the analysis of section 2 that two potentials @xmath176 and @xmath177 related by a shear transformation @xmath178 define similar period functions for periodic orbits .",
    "in fact , not only the periods given by ( [ period ] ) are identical for @xmath176 and @xmath177 but also any integral between the same limits of the form t_f(e)=_x_m(e)^x_m(e)f(e - u(x))dx [ area ] is the same for both potentials .",
    "the proof is simple because the integral ( [ area ] ) can be splitted as t_f(e)=_i=1^nt_f^i(e ) in terms of the integrals t_f^i(e)=_x_i(e)^x_i+1(e)f(e - u(x))dx where @xmath179 , @xmath180 , is the monotone sequence of points whose initial and final points are @xmath181 , @xmath182 , i.e. they coincide with the turning points of the classical trajectory , and the remaining points @xmath183 , for @xmath184 , are defined by the values @xmath185 $ ] for which there is a stationary point @xmath186 $ ] of the potential @xmath187 with the same potential level @xmath188 . in each interval",
    "@xmath189 $ ] the potential function @xmath13 is invertible and the inverse function @xmath190 is uniquely defined .",
    "thus , t_f^i(e)=_u(x_i)^u(x_i+1 ) du f(e - u ) x_i(u )  .",
    "now , by construction , for each interval @xmath191 $ ] there is another one @xmath192 $ ] such that the sum of the contributions to the the integral ( [ area ] ) @xmath193 becomes the same for the two potentials @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "in fact , the integrand and the integral limits in ( [ equiv ] ) are identical for any couple @xmath176 and @xmath177 of shear equivalent potentials .",
    "in particular , this shows that @xmath194 is also the same for all potentials related by a shear transformation and that their first semiclassical quantum corrections to the energy levels , which is given by @xmath195 with @xmath196 , is also the same .    from the discussion of the previous section it follows that scale transformations ( [ scale ] ) also preserve semiclassical corrections to energy levels if @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "however in such a case the classical system is not isochronous .",
    "however the higher order corrections might break the equivalence at the quantum level .",
    "the case b considered in the previous section is the simplest counterexample .",
    "the energy levels @xmath199 @xcite differ from those of the isoperiodic harmonic oscillator e^a_n= ( n+12 ) by terms which start at first order in perturbation theory for small values of the anharmonicity parameter @xmath200    @xmath201    where @xmath202 is the logarithmic derivative of the euler gamma function @xmath203 .",
    "the above perturbative expression for @xmath199 agrees to order @xmath204 with the asymptotic behavior derived from the exact spectral equation @xcite + = 0 .",
    "one particular case where the quantum energy levels remain equal is when the shearing function @xmath28 is constant , @xmath205 .",
    "in such a case both potentials are related by a simple translation @xmath206 , which obviously does not change the quantum spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "further non - trivial examples can be obtained by means of darboux method .",
    "the quantum spectrum is also the same , up to a shift , for two potentials related by a shear transformation when they can be written in the form u_1(x ) = ( w(x)^2-w(x))-a_1;u_2(x ) = ( w(x)^2+w(x))-a_2 , [ darboux ] in terms of a common superpotential @xmath207 with @xmath208 and two constants @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "potentials of such a type are not only related by a classical shear transformation but they are also related by a quantum darboux transformation @xcite which guarantees that the corresponding spectra of the hamiltonians h_i=+u_ii=1,2 are almost identical guarantees that the ground states of the two systems are in one to one correspondence and none has zero energy for @xmath211 . ] .",
    "the case d of section 3 is also an example of such a type .",
    "in fact , choosing w(x)=+xand @xmath212 we have the two potentials of case d u_1(x)=+x^2 - 2;u_2(x)=x^2 [ isotonic ] provided we fix @xmath213 and @xmath214 for simplicity .",
    "it is also clear from the discussion of previous section that both potentials are related by the shear transformation g(u)=+2 + .",
    "[ sh2 ]    more generally , for any choice of the superpotential @xmath215 with parity invariance @xmath216 , i.e. @xmath215 is of the form @xmath217 , it can be shown that the corresponding potentials @xmath218 are related by a parity symmetry @xmath219 . if @xmath176 and @xmath177 are convex functions they are obviously related by the shear transformation .",
    "however , it should also emphasized that not any pair of potentials of the form ( [ darboux ] ) related by a darboux transform are necessarily related by a classical shear transformation .",
    "a simple counterexample is given by @xmath220 .",
    "in that case one gets the potentials u_1(x)=x^8 - 2x^5- 4 x^3 + x^2 + 1 [ uno ] and u_2(x)=x^8 - 2x^5 + 4 x^3 + x^2 - 1 , [ dos ] respectively .",
    "it is obvious from the figure 7 that both potentials are not shear related .",
    "there are further examples of quantum isospectral systems which are not classically isoperiodic .",
    "a very interesting case is the following .",
    "let us consider a standard quantum oscillator ( @xmath221 ) with hamiltonian h_0=12(p^2+x^2 )  .",
    "we know that the eigenvalues and eigenstates of such operator are given by h_0_n(x)=e_n_n(x )  , with e_n=(n+12 ) , n=0,1,2 ,  , and _ n(x)= ( 2^n n!)^-1/2  h_n(x ) ( -2 )  , where @xmath222 denotes the hermite polynomial .",
    "let us now consider the system with the same spectrum , except the lowest eigenvalue @xmath223 : e_n=(n+12 ) , n=1,2,  . for this we perform a similarity transformation which maps @xmath224 into @xmath225 by the formula can be formally achieved but because of the existence of nodes in the wave function @xmath226 the induced potential is not defined on the whole real line @xmath227 @xcite ] _ 0(x)= where ( x)=_x^_0 ^ 2()d=1 _ x^^-^2d  , for which (x)=-_0 ^ 2(x)=-1 e^-x^2  .",
    "the function @xmath229 is the solution of the equation h_0=12 _ 0  , where h=12 p^2+u(x ) and u(x)=u_0(x)+u_1(x ) with u_0(x)=12 x^2,u_1(x)=-2 = -4 ( x ) ( ( x)-x )  , where the functions @xmath230 and @xmath231 are ( x)=2_x^(-^2 ) d  , which satisfies ( x)= and ( x)= ( ( x))^-1(-x^2 )  ; ( x)x  x. notice that the new potential @xmath232 is neither shear equivalent to the harmonic oscillator @xmath233 nor isochronous .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath234 and @xmath235 have the same spectra .",
    "indeed , h _",
    "n(x)=e_n _ n(x )  , n=1,2,  where _ n(x)= _ n(x)-  ( x ) _",
    "n-1(x )  , and the functions @xmath236 are normalized : _",
    "-^|_n(x)|^2 dx=1 and satisfy the completeness condition _ n=1^_n(x)_n(y)=(x - y )  .",
    "i.e the hamiltonians @xmath234 and @xmath237 are isospectral .",
    "the peculiarity of this case is that the two isospectral potentials are neither classically isoperiodic nor related by a darboux transformation .",
    "finally , it is also remarkable that the two families of isospectral rational potentials connected by joukowski transformations as in theorem 4 are in general not isospectral . only the case of isochronous potential",
    "the half harmonic oscillator and the potentials ( [ isotonic ] ) present the same quantum spectrum .",
