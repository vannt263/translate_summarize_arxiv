    "they lead to interesting correlated - electron physics but also provide a handle to design systems with specific properties that can not be reached with noninteracting particles . in this paper",
    "we focus on one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron conductors with strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "such systems have spin - split bands with generally a crossing of two bands with opposite spin projection . through an external magnetic field or intrinsic",
    "soi the degeneracy at the crossing point can be lifted and a gap @xmath0 opens .",
    "we show in this paper that in this situation e - e interactions play a crucial role , which has not been investigated so far .",
    "the interactions lead to a substantial enhancement of the gap and strongly modify the nature of the remaining conducting modes .",
    "underlying the strong response to interactions is the instability of any 1d conductor to the formation of charge- and spin - density waves .",
    "a spatially modulated potential can make this instability dominant and drive the system into an ordered density wave phase , known as the electronic peierls transition .",
    "we show below that the renormalization of @xmath0 can be identified with a peierls - type transition depending on spin and chirality , affecting only one - half of the conducting modes but both spin components . for short ,",

    "it was shown in previous work @xcite that this leads to a reduced conductance and remaining spin - filtered conducting states .",
    "this effect was very recently observed in high - mobility gaas / algaas hole quantum wires.@xcite    we show here that e - e interactions substantially modify the physics within this gap .",
    "indeed , tuning the chemical potential @xmath5 to the middle of @xmath0 leads to the commensurability condition @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the fermi momentum ) at which the e - e interactions have remarkable consequences .",
    "they enhance @xmath0 and for strong e - e interactions an enhancement by more than an order of magnitude is possible . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "the spin filter effect is stabilized , removing the need of fine - tuning external parameters such as chemical potential and magnetic field .",
    "we show below that this renormalization can be mapped onto a peierls - type mechanism .",
    "the interactions also modify the right- ( @xmath8 ) and left- ( @xmath9 ) moving modes with momenta close to @xmath10 , which remain in a spin - filtered conducting state , but form a strongly renormalized electron liquid .",
    "furthermore , we show that the same transition can be achieved without soi through a spiral magnetic field as obtained , for instance , by placing nanomagnets near the conductor , or by the overhauser field generated by nuclear spins through a self - ordering feedback mechanism due to their interaction with electrons.@xcite for systems with soi , a spiral magnetic field with wave number @xmath11 can also be used to obtain the renormalized gap at higher electron densities @xmath12 .",
