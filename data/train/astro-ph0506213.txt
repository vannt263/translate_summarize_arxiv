    "due to their immense size , galaxy clusters can be easily identified with their dark matter halos , and their clustering and number counts can be reliably predicted by dark matter simulations . however in order to find or `` weigh '' galaxy clusters observationally , assumptions of dynamical equilibrium and less understood astrophysics usually come into play . since halos form via the accretion and mergers of smaller units , and for clusters this process is occurring to the present time , such assumptions need to be specified precisely .",
    "for example , how well a galaxy cluster is described by equilibrium properties depends upon whether it has recently undergone a major merger ( where `` major '' means disrupting equilibrium ) and upon the specific methods used for its detection and mass measurement .",
    "thus even if one is only interested in galaxy clusters as `` test particles '' or peaks in the density field , the history of cluster growth is important in order to make contact with observations .",
    "cluster growth histories are also important for understanding other cluster properties . for example",
    ", several observational phenomena ( see below ) are associated with clusters which have recently undergone mergers .",
    "a related question is which cluster properties have the least sensitivity to cluster assembly histories .    in this paper",
    "we study the assembly history and degree of virialization of high - mass halos in large n - body simulations .",
    "a cluster assembly history can be characterized either by events with specific occurrence times , such as mergers or large mass changes , or by properties of its entire history , e.g.  a parameterization of the mass as a function of time .",
    "we calculate several such quantities for a statistically significant sample of halos .",
    "we consider several popular formation time definitions and cluster history parameterizations and statistics .",
    "we also calculate the fraction of `` recently '' merged galaxy clusters as a function of redshift , back to @xmath0 .",
    "the definitions of both `` merger '' and `` recently '' depend on the cluster property of interest and we explore several choices .",
    "we also find the fraction of galaxy clusters which have had a recent large mass gain ( including accretion ) for several choices of interval and two final / initial mass ratios .",
    "merger histories can be reliably extracted from n - body simulations , and as such these recently merged fractions are implicit in earlier work .",
    "however , it can be difficult to obtain specific numbers from the literature for @xmath1cdm models , especially if one has a particular relaxation time in mind . in part",
    "this is because previous studies of different quantities at different times have been published over several years , often using different cosmological models .",
    "here we compute several of these quantities for a much larger sample than used in earlier work , for @xmath1cdm cosmologies , and present them in a homogeneous manner in the hope that this will be a useful reference for the community .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : background ] is a review , including pointers to earlier work on formation times and examples of observed merger phenomena .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] describes the simulations and methods .",
    "a reader interested primary in the results can skip directly to section [ sec : results ] , which has comparisons and distributions of some cluster formation properties , and the fractions of clusters which have recently merged or had a large mass increase , as a function of time .",

    "it should be noted that merger rates and the number of clusters which have recently undergone a merger are slightly different , it is the latter we study here .",

    "observationally , some signatures of mergers can be used to flag unrelaxed clusters .",
    "for instance substructure , the presence of multiple peaks in the cluster surface density on scales larger than the constituent galaxies , has been studied extensively .",
    "several different observational methods have been used to quantify the amount of substructure in x - ray clusters ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fraction of clusters exhibiting substructure has been found to be significant in several surveys .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite visually found substructure in 41% of 208 einstein ipc images , ref .",
    "@xcite measured the emission weighted centroid variation for 65 einstein clusters to get a substructure fraction of 61% ( see also @xcite for related work ) and ref .",
    "@xcite found , using three different indicators , substructure in @xmath8 of 470 clusters in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "substructure has also been searched for in other wave - bands .",
    "for example , substructure was detected in over 80% of 25 low richness 2dfgrs clusters ( @xcite ; see their references for other studies ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , substructure has been considered as a means of constraining cosmology , e.g. in @xcite using 40 chandra clusters over a range of redshifts ( see also @xcite for relevant simulations ) .",
    "a meaningful comparison of our calculated number of `` recently merged '' clusters to the number of observed galaxy clusters with substructure depends on relaxation times .",
    "these times depend upon the substructure measurement in question and are still not well estimated .",
    "for instance , relatively small sub - clumps may take a different amount of time to disappear depending on their density , see @xcite for further discussion .",
    "radio halos and radio relics have been proposed as another merger indicator ( see the reviews @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "clusters hosting radio halos and relics tend to show other signs of merger activity , however not all clusters with other indicators of recent mergers show these radio signals . in a complete sample @xcite at the nrao vla sky survey surface brightness limit",
    ", only 5% of clusters had a radio halo source and 6% had a peripheral relic source , however in clusters with x - ray luminosity larger than @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 , 35% had radio halos or relics . in the rosat sample considered above by ref .",
    "@xcite , 53 clusters of the 470 had radio halos or relics , most of these were high luminosity ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath10 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that more radio halos and relics will be found in lower mass clusters as sensitivities improve ( e.g.   ref .",
    "the relaxation time for radio halos and relics is not known .",
    "the absence of mergers ( i.e. a relaxed cluster ) has been suggested as a requirement for cool core clusters ( e.g.  refs .",
    "the fraction of cool core clusters has been measured for various samples , e.g.  ref.@xcite found with chandra that 55% of 38 clusters in the rosat brightest cluster sample ( with @xmath12 ) show mild cooling ( associated with a cooling time less that @xmath13gyr ) and 34 % show signs of strong cooling ( a cooling time less than @xmath14gyr ) .",
    "there are some simulations that suggest however that mergers may help form cool galaxy cluster cores ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , also 5/22 of the rosat cooling flow clusters have significant substructure @xcite .",
    "there are many more phenomena associated with mergers which are even more complex ( see sarazin s list of questions about merging clusters of galaxies @xcite ) .",
    "the examples of merger indicators reported above have had their occurrence rates measured in some of the largest cluster samples available .",
    "there are some differences between mergers and any form of mass gain .",
    "clusters which have gained mass primarily via accretion might be expected to be more relaxed than those who reach the same mass via a major merger . for smaller halos those with a relatively large mass gain over a short time",
    "are more clustered than halos of the same mass but without this mass gain @xcite .",
    "the subset of recently merged halos , in contrast , does not appear to be so biased @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite conjecture that objects in denser regions tend to have more nearby material to accumulate , resulting in a bias , while the same is not true of recent mergers .",

    "the two normalizations span the observationally preferred range .",
    "outputs were dumped at equal intervals of conformal time , @xmath22mpc ( comoving ) , starting at @xmath23 .",
    "other parameters and details of the simulations can be found in @xcite .    for each output groups",
    "are identified with a friends of friends algorithm ( fof ; @xcite ) using a linking length @xmath24 in units of the mean inter - particle spacing .",
    "these groups correspond roughly to all particles above a density of @xmath25 times the background density .",
    "we did not consider other group finders , a comparison between hop @xcite and fof merger fractions for a smaller sample was considered in @xcite . in that case there were both fewer recently merged clusters and fewer clusters altogether for the fof case .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparison of hop and fof mergers and accretion for smaller mass halos .",
    "they estimate what minimum mass fraction in accretion is robust for different group fractions and find that a 20% mass increase ( for a shorter length of time and smaller halos than we consider ) is outside the `` noise '' region for the fof vs.  hop group finders .    for each group and output time",
    "we compute a number of properties , including the mass , velocity dispersion and potential energy of the group .",
    "all properties are computed using only group members .",
    "masses henceforth refer to friends of friends masses @xmath26 unless otherwise stated . to get @xmath27 or @xmath28 conversion",
    "is needed @xcite  for a fitting formula see @xcite .",
    "from the simulation we find @xmath29 at @xmath6 , and @xmath30 at @xmath0 .",
    "we consider halos to be clusters if @xmath31 ( i.e.  5971 or more particles ) ; at @xmath6 there are 909 clusters in the @xmath32 box and 574 in the @xmath5 box .    for the formation time studies ,",
    "most of the definitions are straightforwardly derived from the cluster histories .",
    "we track the properties of all of the progenitor halos with more than 64 particles for all of our clusters . from these histories",
    "it is straightforward to find the mass of the largest progenitor as a function of time . to find mergers ,",
    "the two largest predecessors are found for each cluster at an earlier time .",
    "the final cluster is said to have had a ( major ) merger between the earlier time and the later time if the ratio of particle numbers going from both of the predecessors into the final cluster is above some minimum . in the case where the time interval of interest does not coincide with a dump time for the data ,",
    "the two closest times bracketing the time of interest are taken , and the merger fraction is linearly interpolated between these ( starting from the time closest to the time of interest ) .",
    "one relaxation time we consider is the crossing time , in this case we start at the earlier time and interpolate between final times .",
    "we checked our definitions of mergers in two ways . instead of using the mass of only progenitor particles which actually go into the final halo in the mass ratio",
    ", one can use the full mass of the progenitor halos , this changes the merged fraction by less than 5% for the longer time intervals and almost always less than 10% for the short time intervals .",
    "we prefer our definition as it might help counteract the inclusion of many unbound particles in halos due to our fof group finder .",
    "secondly , we identify mergers by looking at the initial and final halos and comparing mass ratios of the initial halos , without tracking their intermediate behavior until they merged to the final halo .",
    "a concern was that two predecessors with an initial mass ratio of e.g. 1:5 might first become a mass ratio of 1:10 , say , if the largest progenitor grew significantly in mass relative to the second largest , before merging .",
    "looking at intermediate times , the mass ratio of predecessors is differs for the two definitions , but mostly for almost equal mass predecessors .",
    "once the predecessor mass ratio drops to @xmath33 1:3 the scatter between the two ways of defining predecessor mass ratio gets quite small . using the more accurate definition based on intermediate time steps produces a slightly larger number of recently merged clusters , again less than 5% .",
    "that is , our approximation in some cases underestimates the number of mergers by a small amount .",
    "we vary the mass ratios and time intervals , and consider intervals equally spaced in real time , in light crossings ( scaling as @xmath34 ) and in terms of `` crossing times '' ( scaling as @xmath35 ) .",
    "we call the lookback time the time at which the cluster is observed , and the relaxation time the interval prior to the lookback time within which the merger or mass jump ( `` large @xmath3 '' ) has or hasnt occurred",
    ". intervals of 100 , 300 and @xmath36mpc light crossings correspond to approximately 1 , 3 and @xmath37gyr .",
    "we call these @xmath38mpc in the following .",
    "although the simulations go back to @xmath39 , we only plot back to lookback times where the statistics have any constraining power .",
    "we also consider three- and four - body merger fractions , since such systems have been observed ( see , e.g.  refs .",
    "we define three - body mergers as the case when the second and third largest predecessors each contribute to the final halo at least 20% of the mass contributed by the largest predecessor .",
    "similarly , four - body mergers require the fourth largest predecessor to also contribute at least 20% of the mass contributed by the largest predecessor .",
    "a classic paradigm for cluster assembly histories is the spherical top - hat collapse model . in this model a uniform , overdense region `` breaks away '' from the expansion of the universe , evolving as a self - contained positive curvature universe .",
    "this toy model is often used to motivate the threshold density for virialization or to estimate formation times @xcite .",
    "the evolution of such perturbations does not closely resemble the rich structure seen in the formation of massive halos in n - body simulations , as noted by many authors referenced above , however it is interesting to see how it performs nonetheless .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sthc ] the evolution of the peak circular velocity ( @xmath40 ) of the most massive progenitor for 6 clusters , chosen at random from amongst the most massive ( @xmath41 ) in our @xmath21 simulation .",
    "since the mass in the spherical top - hat model is difficult to compare to simulations ( it is constant and has uniform overdensity ) , we use peak circular velocity .",
    "the peak of the circular velocity curve , @xmath42 , is computed for each progenitor using the minimum of the cluster potential as a center for defining @xmath43 .",
    "the dashed line shows the evolution predicted using the spherical top - hat collapse model for a cluster which virializes at the present .",
    "we see that the spherical infall description has a cluster s peak circular velocity growing most quickly right before virialization , while clusters forming in a cosmological simulation have more of a steady growth over time ) and then collapses ( rising @xmath44 ) . ] .",
    "we have also marked on the plot four of the formation times defined and discussed below , @xmath2 , @xmath45 , @xmath4 and @xmath46 .    a different view of the formation of clusters is given in fig .  [ fig : virial ] which focuses on the same 6 clusters as fig .",
    "[ fig : sthc ] . in the top panels we show the mass of the largest progenitor as a function of time .",
    "in the middle panel we show the ratio of the 1d velocity dispersion to the peak circular velocity  this has been used as a proxy for the degree of virialization of the clusters @xcite . in the lower panel",
    "we show the relation between the total kinetic and potential energy explicitly .",
    "both energies have been computed using only the particles in the fof group , but no proxy has been used , unlike the middle panel .    even focusing only on the most massive progenitor , rather than the full merger tree ,",
    "the upper panels show the rich phenomenology of cluster formation .",
    "there are several obvious mass jumps interspersed between periods of relatively smooth accretion .",
    "the lower panels show that the cluster is disturbed by mergers and large mass jumps with strong departures from the expected virial relation @xmath47 .",
    "the departures last for several of our output times .",
    "the `` standard '' vacuum virial relation @xmath48 is not satisfied by these clusters even in their quiescent phase .",
    "the ratio @xmath49 is typically larger than unity due to the steady accretion of material onto the cluster@xcite and there is an overall decline in @xmath49 with time .",
    "averaging over the entire cluster sample we find for objects of fixed mass the ke / pe ratio decreases with decreasing redshift . for objects at fixed redshift",
    "the ratio increases with increasing mass . for objects at fixed number density",
    "the ratio decreases with decreasing redshift . for fixed mass cut or number",
    "density the decline is steeper below @xmath50 than above @xmath50 and within errors the decline below @xmath50 has the same shape for all samples .",
    "we hypothesize that this decline in ke / pe as due to the cessation of structure formation due to @xmath1 domination below @xmath0 ( plus a small shift in the mass of objects currently undergoing rapid accretion ) .",
    "we will see a similar drop in merger activity below @xmath0 in the next section .",
    "we attempted to further quantify the relaxation of clusters to the background virial relation as a function of time since last major disturbance ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , but we found the scatter was too large for us to draw robust conclusions .    even though cluster formation is a complex process it is sometimes useful to attempt to describe it with a single `` formation time '' .",
    "any such compression of information must be imperfect , and to some extent arbitrary .",
    "depending on the phenomenon of interest different times may be more or less appropriate .",
    "for this reason several definitions in the literature exist for the `` formation time '' of a cluster .",
    "we calculate several of these and their distributions for the @xmath21 sample of 574 clusters below .",
    "the first definition we consider is when a cluster had its most recent large @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath51 in an interval @xmath22mpc . in this section",
    "a mass `` jump '' refers to a mass gain of at least this much . for any cluster @xmath2",
    "is the redshift of the most recent such jump . in our sample",
    "13 clusters had no large mass jumps at any time after @xmath39 , two of these clusters are more massive than @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite found that 2 out of their sample of 20 did not have any large mass jumps .",
    "another common definition is when the cluster has reached at least half its mass , for this time there is an analytic formula @xcite which was tested in ( and improved using ) simulations in ref .",
    "we define @xmath45 as the earliest output time when the cluster had at least half of its mass .",
    "the relation between these two definitions is shown in the upper left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : formtime ] .",
    "there is a large amount of scatter between the two definitions but there is a striking transition at @xmath53 . for clusters which have not reached half of their present day mass before @xmath53 , almost all have had a large @xmath3 jump after reaching half - mass , i.e.  they have at least half of their mass before they have their last large mass jump .",
    "however , for clusters which attained @xmath45 before redshift @xmath53 ( 286 clusters ) , slightly under one third ( 80 ) had their most recent mass jump even earlier ( i.e.  @xmath54 ) . an intuitive reason for this is that clusters which reached half of their mass early on have not been gaining mass quickly and so are less likely to have large mass jumps after @xmath45 .",
    "this general shape persists if one considers some other `` formation time '' such as @xmath55 or @xmath56 ( with obvious definitions ) , the @xmath57 value where @xmath2 starts becoming larger ( that is , earlier ) than @xmath58 is larger ( smaller ) than that for @xmath45 . a larger fraction ( 12/33 ) of the clusters with mass greater than @xmath52 and @xmath59",
    "had @xmath60 .",
    "if one is interested in formation times in order to find undisturbed clusters , for lower redshifts it appears that @xmath2 may be a more conservative estimate .",
    "a third definition of a cluster formation time is when the potential well of the object becomes deep enough to be considered `` a cluster '' .",
    "we take this , somewhat arbitrarily , to be when the object has reached @xmath61 , and call this @xmath62 .",
    "all of these definitions rely on special events in the mass accretion history .",
    "an alternative is to use the whole history of the most massive progenitor .",

    "even some clusters which gained more than 90% of their mass in the range we consider have @xmath4 which depends sensitively on the fit range .",

    "however , given the correlations between the different fit `` formation times '' and between these and e.  g.  concentration , these fits may be very useful approximations in a large number of cases .",
    "the above shows that the present day cluster population has a very wide spread of formation times and frequent major disruptions . for observational purposes ,",
    "another question is : how many clusters at a given redshift ( `` lookback time '' ) have had a large disruption recently ( within a given `` relaxation time '' ) .",

    "different relaxation times are considered .",
    "for some phenomena associated with mergers the relaxation times of interest depend on the time of observation .",
    "we saw in the previous section that departures from the virial relation lasted several hundred mpc of conformal time .",
    "this is not unexpected .",
    "a typical relaxation time is likely some fraction of the halo dynamical time .",
    "since clusters have @xmath101 and characteristic times scale as @xmath102 , typical timescales should be @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the hubble time .",
    "@xcite noted that x - ray disturbances in their gas simulations lasted @xmath105mpc ( scaling as @xmath34 rather than the crossing time @xmath106 ) .",
    "this corresponds to roughly @xmath107gyr at the present , and shorter times in the past .",

    "the ratio between the fractions with mergers and large @xmath3 does not change as much with lookback time compared to the case where the relaxation time was independent of the lookback time .",

    "more details can be obtained from the earlier plots and the tables .",
    "another question of interest might be : in how many major mergers do three or four predecessors have comparable mass ?",
    "we took one particular definition as described in the methods section .",
    "these three - body mergers were fairly common , the exact numbers depend upon relaxation times considered .",
    "for the @xmath5 case , about 15% of the 1:5 mergers were three - body for @xmath124mpc and slightly less than 30% for @xmath125mpc on average , with little evidence of growth with time .",
    "for @xmath32 the fraction of three - body mergers to 1:5 major mergers was closer to 10% on average and seemed to grow with time for @xmath105mpc . for @xmath125mpc",
    "this growth was more evident , starting around 12% and growing to around 30% . for fixed relaxation times , 2.5 ( 1.0 ) gyr ,",
    "the fraction of three - body major mergers to 1:5 major mergers showed a definite increase with lookback time .",

    "for @xmath32 the fraction started at 12% ( 5% ) and grew to 55% ( 25% ) at lookback times of @xmath92gyr .",
    "this means that even though a 1:5 merger might not be considered `` major '' by some definitions , it is very possible that there are two of these going on at the same time , making these mergers more energetic .",
    "there were many fewer four - body mergers .",
    "the largest effect was for the @xmath89gyr relaxation time , where four - body mergers were about one third of the three - body mergers . in the largest case , for @xmath21 and @xmath89gyr",
    "relaxation time , the total fraction of clusters which had had a recent four - body merger only reached 5% or above for lookback times greater than @xmath126gyr .",
    "clusters of galaxies represent the current endpoint of structure formation . as the largest systems which have had time to virialize in a universe with hierarchical structure formation",
    ", they make excellent laboratories for cosmology , large - scale structure and galaxy formation .",
    "the formation of galaxy clusters via a combination of mergers and accretion of smaller objects is crucial to understanding many of their present day properties .    in this paper",
    "we investigated the formation of galaxy clusters in some detail , and the major events which define this process , extending earlier studies @xcite discussed in  [ sec : background ] . while galaxy cluster formation properties can be reliably calculated with the present generation of large , high - resolution n - body simulations , it is difficult to find specific numbers in the literature . to remedy this",
    "we have calculated , for a sample of hundreds of clusters , the degree of virialization , formation time , and for two values of the clustering amplitude @xmath127 , the fraction of disturbed galaxy clusters for many definitions of disturbed .",
    "we began by showing the time histories of a few clusters to illustrate the typical formation pattern : periods of smooth accretion punctuated by large increases in mass .",
    "we then turned to various characterizations of this process , applied to our statistical sample as a whole .",
    "we first calculated the ratio of kinetic to potential energy . at early times",
    "clusters are hotter than the vacuum virial relation ( 2ke@xmath128pe ) would predict due to continuous infall of material . with the onset of @xmath1 domination and the cessation of structure growth the excess kinetic energy drops and their mass accretion rate slows .",
    "we then turned to formation time definitions in the literature ; while no single number can capture the complexity of a cluster merging tree , the concept of a formation time encodes much useful information .",
    "we compared different formation time definitions which are relevant for different types of observations .",
    "for instance a recent large mass jump may not be of interest if one only wants to know when the cluster first was detectable by sz decrement ( which presumably depends more on the depth of the potential well ) , but may be relevant for studies which rely on a cluster being old enough to be dynamically relaxed .",
    "the different formation times we considered are correlated , with large scatter .",
    "formation times relying upon a smooth parameterized fit to galaxy cluster histories were most correlated with each other , but the results were sensitive to the fit methodology , due to the large amount of recent sporadic mass gain .",
    "we compared the distributions of the different formation times for our whole cluster sample and for our more massive clusters , again finding some correlation but also significant scatter .",
    "we then turned from smooth parameterizations to the characteristic abrupt jumps in mass over time for galaxy clusters .",
    "on average , galaxy clusters have had at least 4 large mass jumps since @xmath129 , this number increases with cluster mass ; about half of the clusters get at least half of their mass in these jump events .",
    "the above measurements were for our @xmath5 sample of 574 clusters .",
    "the second part of the paper reported the time dependence of the fraction of clusters which have had a recent mass jump or major merger , using in addition a @xmath130 sample of 909 clusters .",
    "these fractions should be of use for estimates of the number of `` relaxed '' clusters available in surveys ( given a relaxation time for the phenomena of interest ) and for helping to constrain relaxation times for phenomena associated with mergers or mass jumps where the phenomenon s occurrence fraction has been measured but not its relaxation time . in figs .",
    "[ fig : merger1]-[fig : merger3 ] and tables [ tab:1.0gyr]-[tab : sound ] we give the merger fractions for a number of different situations .",
    "these fractions also serve to quantify the previously seen trend of more recent mergers ( fractionally ) at higher redshift . comparing @xmath6 with @xmath131 ( about @xmath118gyr ago ) ,",
    "the fraction of clusters which had a recent merger or mass jump is doubled by almost any definition and for some definitions the increase is even larger .",
