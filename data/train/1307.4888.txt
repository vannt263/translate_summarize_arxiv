    "in @xcite ( to be referred to as part i hereafter ) , we have presented a framework of multi - scale turbulence modeling with the correlations up to the fourth order , based on the navier - stokes equations , reynolds average , the constraints of inequality from the physical considerations and the cauchy - schwarz inequality and so on , the maximum information principle and the alternative objective function such as turbulent energy contained in the flow .",
    "the model is an optimal control problem with the fourth order correlations as the control variables .",
    "we have adopted the notion of the information @xmath4 and the maximum information principle , unlike that of edwards and mccomb @xcite who resorted to the entropy method to fix certain response functions of an isotropic homogeneous model through the maximization of entropy .",
    "the interpretation of the information @xmath4 as a thermodynamic entropy raises an interesting issue ; if we view the navier - stokes equations as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics in that @xmath5 or @xmath6 , the question arises on how to justify @xmath4 as another entropy of thermodynamic nature , in addition to the one leading to @xmath6 . as an alternative , one may view the information as the mixing entropy as done in @xcite ( of macro - scales ) .",
    "the next important question is how to make the evaluation of @xmath4 computationally feasible under certain constraints such as the equations of evolution for the correlations and the positive semi - definiteness of the reynolds stress listed in part i. from the point of view of modeling , the maximization of the information @xmath4 under the constraints reflects the uncertainty in our inference based on the data and information available and specified , a ground for our adoption of the notion .    to understand the mathematical challenges faced by the formulation of part i , we apply it to two - dimensional homogeneous shear turbulence in this work .",
    "we need to modify the formulation slightly , especially the alternative objective function , in order to cope with the infinite domain of motion ; the turbulent energy density is used as the objective to be maximized . on the basis of the supposed homogeneity , fourier transforms are applied to the correlations , and two primary integro - differential equations are obtained in the fourier wave number space , one for the second order correlations and the other for the third order correlations . without imposing the objective maximization and the constraints of inequality , these two equations can be solved formally by the method of characteristics and by the separation of variables , respectively : ( i ) the solutions of the former hold for rather general initial conditions and describe the corresponding evolution of the motion ( the transient state solutions ) .",
    "( ii ) the solutions from the latter hold for some special initial conditions and have an exponential dependence on time with spatial supports ( the asymptotic state solutions ) .",
    "( iii ) under certain conditions yet to be studied , a transient solution evolves , at great time , into a corresponding asymptotic state solution , and this evolution process involves the turbulent energy transfer among different wave numbers or different spatial scales .",
    "the asymptotic state solutions are characterized by the dimensionless exponential time rate of growth , @xmath0 , compatible with the studies of three - dimensional homogeneous shear turbulence ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and the rate of growth is bounded from above by @xmath7 @xmath2 @xmath3 , as argued mathematically with the help of certain constraints of inequality ; the existence of such an upper bound in the associated three - dimensional shear turbulence will be explored in a report forthcoming .",
    "the asymptotic solutions of the fourth order model are to be obtained from convex programming , with mathematical proofs to argue for the convexity of the quadratic constraints on the basis of linearization .    for the asymptotic state solutions of the reduced model with the correlations up to the third order , the objective and all the constraints are linear , and the optimization reduces to a linear programming problem , with the possibility of either the primary component @xmath8 of the third order correlations or an associated integral quantity @xmath9 as the optimal control variable . for the sake of exploring the multi - scale structure of the turbulent motion ,",
    "we relax mathematically the restriction of @xmath7 @xmath2 @xmath3 to @xmath7 @xmath10 @xmath11 , which is justified and allowed by the two additional arguments for the existence of @xmath12 in the reduced model . at a specific @xmath13 ,",
    "the asymptotic solutions of the correlations are effectively nontrivial only inside certain bounded domains of the wave number spaces ; and the sizes of the domains shrink as @xmath14 increases from @xmath3 to @xmath7 . in the case that @xmath9 is the optimal control variable , there exist feasible solutions for any @xmath15 , implying that the reduced model may be inadequate to simulate the transient states which do not decay .",
    "the homogeneous turbulence modeling problem concerned may also be viewed as a stability problem due to the averaged flow field is held constant .",
    "it raises the possibility that the framework of optimization developed here may have relevance to flow stability analysis .",
    "further works need to be done to assess the adequacy and the feasibility of the idea .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : homogeneousturbulence ] , we develop the differential equations , the constraints of inequality and the objective function in physical and fourier wave number spaces . in section  [ sec : formalsolutionswithoutenforcingconstraints ] , without enforcing the maximization of the objective function and the constraints of inequality , we present the formal solutions , both transient and asymptotic , to the primary integro - differential equations . also , we discuss the effects of bounded solutions at finite time on the distributions of the correlations in the wave number spaces , the intrinsic equalities of zero sum balance for some integral quantities , and the evolution of a transient state solution to an asymptotic state solution under certain conditions .",
    "we also address the relevance of the formulation of turbulence modeling as optimal control to flow stability analysis . in section  [ sec : asymptoticstatesolution ] , we analyze in detail the asymptotic state solutions , especially for the case of the reduced model .",
    "the convexity of the quadratic constraints is demonstrated ; various restrictions on the exponential growth rate are discussed ; the possible structures of the correlations in the wave number space are explored and two possible implementations of numerical approximations are presented .",
    "to examine how challenging the formulation proposed in part i is mathematically and whether it can produce adequate results , we consider the homogeneous shear turbulence in @xmath16 @xmath17 with an average velocity field of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a nontrivial constant . since the average flow field of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is not affected by the correlations , we need to consider only the fluctuation fields of @xmath22 and @xmath23 governed by @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26    due to the symmetry of the flows associated with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we will restrict to @xmath28 in this work . under this restriction",

    "<S> we consider two - dimensional homogeneous shear turbulence within the context of optimal control , a multi - scale turbulence model containing the fluctuation velocity and pressure correlations up to the fourth order ; the model is formulated on the basis of the navier - stokes equations , reynolds average , the constraints of inequality from both physical and mathematical considerations , the turbulent energy density as the objective to be maximized , and the fourth order correlations as the control variables . without imposing the maximization and the constraints , the resultant equations of motion in the fourier wave number space are formally solved to obtain the transient state solutions , the asymptotic state solutions and the evolution of a transient toward an asymptotic under certain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic state solutions are characterized by the dimensionless exponential time rate of growth @xmath0 which has an upper bound of @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ; the asymptotic solutions can be obtained from a linear objective convex programming . for the asymptotic state solutions of the reduced model containing the correlations up to the third order , the optimal control problem reduces to linear programming with the primary component of the third order correlations or a related integral quantity as the control variable ; the supports of the second and third order correlations are estimated for the sake of numerical simulation ; the existence of feasible solutions is demonstrated when the related quantity is the control variable . </S>",
