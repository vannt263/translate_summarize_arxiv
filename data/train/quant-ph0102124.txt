    "quantum optical systems are ideal for the experimental test of the foundation of quantum mechanics @xcite as well as for the experimental implementation of quantum information protocols like quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding  @xcite and quantum computation  @xcite . in most of the above experiments the key point is the generation and the detection of entangled states .",
    "while the generation of various kind of entangled states is now part of the daily routine of a good laboratory the detection can be a surprisingly difficult task .",
    "the most typical example is probably the detection of bell states @xcite , for which it has been shown the impossibility to build a setup able to discriminate with 100% efficiency all the four bell states using only linear optical devices @xcite .",
    "such impossibility to discriminate the states of an orthogonal basis is by no means restricted to entangled systems .",
    "we will show that this difficulty is present also in the case of an orthogonal basis of a bipartite system which has been introduced in connection with non locality without entanglement .",
    "non locality has always been associated with quantum entanglement . in a recent article",
    "however @xcite bennett et al have provided a counterexample by showing the existence of an orthogonal set of states of a bipartite system which , although not entangled , are not distinguishable by means of bilocal measurements .",
    "given two particles , each of which described by a three dimensional hilbert space , they construct the following orthogonal basis :    @xmath0    where a , b label the two particles and @xmath1 are three orthogonal states for each particle .",
    "the peculiar property of states ( [ primi ] ) is that they can not be reliably distinguished by two separate observers by means of any sequence of local operations even if they are allowed to exchange classical communication .    in this paper",
    "we propose an optical realization of states ( [ primi ] ) and investigate the possibility to fully discriminate them with a _ global measurement by means of linear elements_. a related problem has been investigated in connection with the possibility to discriminate bell states .",
    "it has been shown @xcitethat it is not possible to perform a complete bell measurement on a product hilbert space of two two - level bosonic systems states by means of purely linear optical elements .",
    "one might expect that this is due to the entangled nature of the bell states .",
    "however , following the line of  @xcite , we will show that also states  ( [ primi ] ) are not fully distinguishable by a global measurement using only linear elements , even though they are not entangled .",
    "[ figdomino ]",
    "in our optical setup the three dimensional hilbert space of each subsystem is mapped into the single photon state of three different modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the basis states @xmath1 for each of the two subsystems will therefore be of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( 1=1,2,3 ) are bosonic creation operators of three orthogonal modes and @xmath4 is the vacuum state . in this",
    "notation states ( [ primi ] ) are written as follows @xmath5 the impossibility to distinguish states ( [ stati ] ) by means of bilocal measurements implies that they are not distinguishable by measuring directly the photon number of each individual mode .",
    "a first attempt to implement a collective measurement could be to mix the modes by means of linear devices and than to measure the output modes of such device .",
    "however , following @xcite we will adopt a more general strategy .",
    "we will assume to have at our disposal a set of as many additional modes as we like , here indicated with bosonic creation operators @xmath6 , with any number of photons we like and we will assume that these auxiliary modes can be mixed with modes @xmath7 in a black box .",
    "the output modes of this box are linked to the input ones by a unitary transformation @xmath8 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that any such unitary transformations of modes can be obtained by means of linear optical devices , like beam splitters and phase shifters . to ensure the largest possible generality in our measurement apparatus we will assume the possibility to perform conditional measurements . in practice",
    "this means what follows : assume that a measurement is made on one selected output mode while the other are kept in a delay loop and that , according to the outcome of the measurement , these modes are fed into a selected further black box , in a cascade setup ( see figure  [ cascade ] ) .",
    "the final assumption we will make is that our detectors have the ability to discriminate the number of incident photons .",
    "this assumption is clearly unrealistic .",
    "we will show , however , that even if such detectors were available , the measurement setup described above can not discriminate states  ( [ stati ] ) .    )",
    "are mixed in a first `` box '' with auxiliary modes .",
    "selected output mode is then measured and depending on its outcome the remaining output modes are fed in a new box . the process can be repeated over and over again , width=302 ]",
    "in this section we will describe some symmetry properties of states ( [ stati ] ) which are not only interesting per se but also will turn out useful in the following .",
    "consider the following transformation @xmath9 which permutes the modes of photon @xmath10 with the ones of photon @xmath11 : @xmath12    this is obviously a linear transformation . in the basis states @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17,@xmath18 @xmath19 takes the following matrix form    @xmath20    the set of states  ( [ stati ] ) is globally invariant under the action of @xmath19 since    @xmath21    furthermore it is straightforward to verify that @xmath22 .",
    "another linear transformation we will use in the following is the one which introduces a phase change of @xmath23 on states @xmath14 and @xmath17 leaving unaltered all the others . in matrix form    @xmath24    the action of @xmath25 on states  ( [ stati ] ) is simply    @xmath26    with @xmath27 form a group which leaves states  ( [ stati ] ) invariant . furthermore , by repeated action of @xmath28 and @xmath19 , it is possible to transform any @xmath29 into any other @xmath30 , with the exception of @xmath31 which is mapped onto itself .",
    "for instance we can transform @xmath32 into a generic @xmath33 ( with k=1 ... 4 ) by acting with the operator    @xmath34    this implies that the problem of how to generate the states  ( [ stati ] ) reduces to the problem of how to generate one of them as the others can be obtained by repeated action of @xmath35 and @xmath19 and , as we have said already , this can be achieved by linear optical devices .",
    "we will now show that the use of auxiliary photons in the measurement setup described in section  [ setup ] does not help in increasing the distinguishability of states  ( [ stati ] ) .",
    "the argument is a generalization to our more complex set of states of the one used in  @xcite in connection with the problem of distinguishing bell states with an analogous setup . in this section",
    "we will outline the proof , leaving the details to appendix  [ appa ] .    as described already our measuring apparatus",
    "consists of a cascade of `` black boxes '' , in which modes are linearly mixed , and partial measurements , which determine the sequence of unitary mixing .",
    "the first of such black box , denoted by @xmath36 , is made out of linear optical elements and its input and output are a set of bosonic modes .",
    "the joint input modes consist of our six `` system '' modes @xmath37 and an arbitrary number of auxiliary modes @xmath38 .",
    "these input modes are unitarily mixed in the box into a set of output modes @xmath39 where the @xmath40 mode is the one on which a measurement will be performed",
    ". the measurement outcome will determine the specific unitary mixing that will be performed in next step of the measurement , consisting of a second box @xmath41 .",
    "while the measurement on mode @xmath40 is performed the photons in the remaining @xmath42 modes are kept in a waiting loop .",
    "the whole measurement procedure consists of a cascade of conditional measurements as described above .",
    "let s now look more in detail at the first block of the apparatus .",
    "the input state of @xmath36 can be written as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a polynomial of degree 2 and @xmath45 is a polynomial of arbitrary degree in the @xmath46    the corresponding output state is    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are nothing but @xmath45 e @xmath50 written in terms of the creation and annihilation operators at the output of @xmath36 .",
    "we can expand @xmath51 in terms of decreasing powers of @xmath40 as follows    @xmath52    in ( [ espan ] ) @xmath53 is the largest order in @xmath40 for the nine @xmath54 and by definition is independent on index @xmath55 ( @xmath56 can be zero for some @xmath55 ) .",
    "analogously @xmath57 is defined as the order in @xmath58 of polynomial @xmath59 .",
    "we can therefore rewrite ( [ output ] ) as    @xmath60    out of the possible outcomes of the measurement of the number @xmath61 of photons in mode @xmath62 we will concentrate on two particular outcomes , namely those resulting in the highest number , @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the reason of this particular choice will be shortly evident .",
    "let s suppose now that the number of photons on the selected mode @xmath62 is measured",
    ". if @xmath61 is the outcome of such measurement the ( unormalised ) conditional state of the remaining modes can be we written as    @xmath66    if the input states are to be distinguishable the conditional states @xmath67 _ must be orthogonal for each possible value of @xmath61 _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath68    in appendix  [ appa ] we will show that the two conditions    @xmath69    can be simultaneously satisfied if and only if the two conditions    @xmath70    are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "the important point is that  ( [ without ] ) _ do not depend on the auxiliary input states_. it is easy to convince oneself that this is the case since from  ( [ stcond ] ) follows that    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the conditional output state obtained from @xmath73 in the absence of auxiliary photons when @xmath61 photons are measured in mode @xmath62 .",
    "the central point of this section is that the fact that condition  ( [ withaux ] ) implies condition  ( [ without ] ) is equivalent to say that any pair of states @xmath73 , @xmath74 are distinguishable in the presence of auxiliary photons only if they are distinguishable in the absence of auxiliary photons . in other words",
    "auxiliary photons do not improve complete distinguishability .",
    "we will now show that it is impossible for states  ( [ stati ] ) to satisfy    @xmath75    for all @xmath55 , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .    in the absence of auxiliary photons",
    "states @xmath29 can be written in terms of a polynomial of creation operators as    @xmath78    let s now define the creation operator vector as    @xmath79    where the @xmath80 are a possible set of ( empty ) auxiliary modes . since the @xmath73 are two photon states they can be written in terms of a real symmetric matrix @xmath81 as follows @xmath82    where the exact form of @xmath81 can be obtained from  ( [ stati ] ) .",
    "if @xmath83 is a generic unitary matrix transforming the input modes into the output ones of our apparatus than    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 with @xmath87 corresponding to the detected output mode .",
    "states  ( [ psi ] ) can than be written as    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the generic matrix element of @xmath90 whose dimension @xmath91 corresponds to the number of output modes involved .",
    "let s write @xmath83 as @xmath92    where @xmath93 are the element of the first column of the matrix and @xmath94 ( with @xmath95 ) are vectors of dimension @xmath96 representing the remaining elements of row @xmath97 . as a consequence of the unitarity of @xmath83 we have @xmath98",
    "we define the columns vector @xmath99 whose elements are the first 6 elements of the @xmath100 column of @xmath83 : @xmath101 we recall that @xmath53 is the highest degree of @xmath87 in polynomials @xmath102 for all values of @xmath55 , in other words the maximum number of photons which can be detected in @xmath62 for all possible input states @xmath103",
    ". obviously @xmath53 can assume only values @xmath104 , depending on the specific choice of @xmath83 and @xmath62 .",
    "we will now show that for all possible value of @xmath53 it is impossible to satisfy simultaneously ( [ condo1 ] ) and  ( [ condo2 ] ) .    _",
    "@xmath105 _ : this corresponds to a bad choice of mode @xmath62 , as the monitored mode would be decoupled from the input ones for all possible input state .    _",
    "@xmath106 _ : this corresponds to @xmath107 for all value of @xmath55 ( see  ( [ svlp ] ) ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath108    the above relation is a constrain on @xmath99 which we will now show to be incompatible with  ( [ condo1 ] ) .    to this end",
    "we note that from  ( [ svlp ] ) follows that after the detection of one photon in mode @xmath62 the remaining modes are left in the ( unormalised ) conditional state @xmath109    where for convenience of notation we have introduced the vector @xmath110    from  ( [ statocondns1 ] ) and  ( [ vettm0 ] ) follows that the trivial solution @xmath111 implies @xmath112 @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath105 .",
    "we must therefore look for possible nontrivial solutions of eq .",
    "( [ ns1 ] ) compatible with  ( [ condo1 ] ) , which in this particular case reads @xmath114    however , as shown in appendix [ appb ] conditions  ( [ ns1 ] ) and  ( [ condo1ns1 ] ) are compatible only with the trivial solution .",
    "this implies that it is not possible to build a complete discriminator for @xmath106 .    _",
    "@xmath115 _ this corresponds a non zero probability to measure two photons in mode @xmath62 for some @xmath73 which implies @xmath116 for at least one value of @xmath55 . on the other hand condition  ( [ condo1 ] ) can be satisfied in this specific case if and only if @xmath116 for at most one value of @xmath55 , which we will denote by @xmath117 .",
    "condition  ( [ condo1 ] ) than becomes @xmath118 and  ( [ condo2 ] ) becomes equivalent to condition  ( [ condo1ns1 ] ) . in order to complete our proof",
    "it will therefore be enough to show that whatever the value of @xmath117 conditions  ( [ ns2 ] ) and  ( [ condo1ns1 ] ) can not be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "suppose in particular that they are not satisfied for @xmath119 , the symmetry analysis carried out in the previous section immediately lead to the conclusion that they can not be satisfied by any other value @xmath117 ( apart from @xmath120 ) .",
    "we have shown that it is always possible to build a linear operator @xmath121 which transforms @xmath32 into @xmath73 ( @xmath122 ) and leaves the set of states @xmath123 globally invariant . if there were a linear operator @xmath124 such to satisfy conditions  ( [ ns2 ] ) and  ( [ condo1ns1 ] ) for any value of @xmath125 than @xmath126 would satisfy the same conditions for @xmath127 , which contradicts our initial assumption .",
    "the problem than reduces to the analysis of the cases @xmath128 and @xmath127 . such analysis , straightforward but tedious ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) , leads to the result that indeed for both values of @xmath117 conditions  ( [ ns2 ] ) and  ( [ condo1ns1 ] ) are incompatible .",

    "bennett et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that they can not be discriminated by means of local action and classical communication .",
    "we have demonstrated that to add the possibility of global interference it is still not sufficient . in other words",
    "we have shown the impossibility to fully discriminate them by means of a global measurement using linear elements , like beam splitters and phase shifters , delay lines and electronically switched linear elements , photodetectors and auxiliary photons .    the impossibility to implement such a measurement",
