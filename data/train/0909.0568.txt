    "environment has an important effect on the evolution of galaxies . the observation of @xcite that high - redshift clusters contain a much higher percentage of blue spiral galaxies than present - day clusters indicates possible evolution and transformation of spirals in the densest regions of the universe .",
    "further evidence is seen in the star formation rates of galaxies in clusters which are much lower than those galaxies of similar morphology in the field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one outstanding question is whether spiral galaxies are somehow transformed into the present - day lenticular , or s0 , galaxies .",
    "the mechanism for such a transformation is still not clear : stripping , interactions , and the cessation of star formation leading to the fading of a spiral disk have all been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is now accepted that the galaxy group environment plays an important influence on the evolution of galaxies .",
    "star formation is suppressed with respect to the field , in galaxies which lie in densities equivalent to the group environment @xcite , and over half of all galaxies live in the group environment @xcite .",
    "intra - group x - rays are observed in dynamically evolved groups , and these groups also tend to have a central , bright elliptical galaxy and high early - type fraction in the group ( e.g. @xcite ) , similar as is seen in the much denser , and rarer cluster environment .",
    "one of the first signs of a spiral galaxy undergoing a transformation is the cessation of star formation , and the loss of cool gas .",
    "the latter is detectable via observations of the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) in spiral galaxies .",
    "it is well - known that spiral galaxies in rich clusters tend to contain less hi  than field spirals of similar morphology and size - these galaxies are `` hi  deficient '' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there have been several claims of a similar hi  deficiency detected in loose groups of galaxies @xcite .",
    "galaxy groups are the ideal environment for galaxy - galaxy interactions due to the low relative velocities of the galaxies , and coupled with the observation of hi  deficient galaxies in groups where there is no hot intra - group gas , galaxy interactions could be a way of removing hifrom spiral galaxies",
    ". however , the detection of ram pressure stripping of a galaxy in a loose group @xcite begs the question of the frequency and significance of this process .",
    "such a question can only be answered by a consistent blind hi  survey of loose groups , in combination with multi - wavelength data , including x - ray data .    as the hi  distribution of galaxies changes with environment , so does the hi  mass distribution ( hereafter hi  mass function ) .",
    "the hiparkes all sky survey ( hipass ) shows a trend for a steepening low - mass slope in denser environments @xcite .",
    "conversely , @xcite find the low - mass slope flattens with denser environment .",
    "both studies have biases however - the hipass sample used only hi  detected galaxies to measure the density of the environment , and the @xcite study was based on an optically selected sample of galaxies .",
    "there have been a limited number of blind histudies of groups and clusters .",
    "@xcite found an hi  mass function with a low - mass slope consistent with being flat in a blind survey of eight groups , and a flat low - mass slope has also been observed in both the virgo cluster @xcite and the canis venatici region @xcite .",
    "conversly , a steep low - mass slope was found for the centaurus a group @xcite .    to address some of the issues and inconsistencies detailed above",
    ", we are conducting a study on the effect of the group environment on galaxies , the group evolution multi - wavelength study ( gems ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we have conducted a wide - field hi  imaging study of sixteen nearby gems groups , using the parkes radiotelescope .",
    "our data gives us optically unbiased hi  observations of a @xmath0 region around the groups , and a velocity coverage of @xmath1  kms@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite studied the dynamics , group membership , and optical properties of the sixteen groups . in this paper",
    "we detail the hiproperties of the sixteen groups , and we probe the hi  mass function in groups and surrounding environment .",
    "all velocities quoted are heliocentric , in the optical convention , and we use @xmath3 = 70  kms@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the full gems sample includes 60 galaxy groups , chosen from ten optical catalogues , the majority with recession velocities between 10003000  kms@xmath2  and with a rosat pspc exposure time of more than 10,000s within 20@xmath4 of the group position .",
    "the full selection criteria are given in osmond & ponman ( 2004 ) and forbes et al .",
    "we chose 16 groups that were near or south of declination 0@xmath5 , for wide - field hi  imaging at parkes .",
    "the groups selected for hi  observations have a variety of x - ray properties , from just the central galaxy being detected ( 6 groups ) , to diffuse group - scale x - ray emission ( 8 groups ) , to no x - ray detection at all ( 2 groups ) .",
    "properties of the sixteen observed groups are given in table  [ tab : groups_properties ] , including the number of members , x - ray and hi  parameters , and early - type fraction .",
    "observing parameters for the groups , including central observing position , central observing velocity , and number of galaxies detected in hi are given in table  [ tab : groups ] .",
    "we also list the distance to each group from @xcite , who find the most accurate distance available to each group either from surface brightness fluctuation measurements , globular cluster luminosity functions , or the corrected mean group velocity .",
    "@xmath6 sources have atca observations , and thus a confirmed optical counterpart ( except in the case of gems_n3783_2 where no optical counterpart is seen).the references are : + @xmath7 @xcite + @xmath8 @xcite + @xmath9 @xcite + @xmath10 @xcite + @xmath11 velocity is a previous hi  measurement associated with this galaxy .",
    "+ @xmath12 previously catalogued optical counterpart is further than 8 arcminutes from the central hi  position .",
    "confirmation of optical counterpart is required ."
