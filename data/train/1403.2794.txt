    "the diversity of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) with spin ( and orbital ) degrees of freedom is one of the main targets in the research of ultracold atom systems .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in electronic systems with hole - like and electron - like fermi pockets , interaction between hole and electron in the fermi pockets tends to induce charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) with wave vector @xmath2 which spans the hole - like and electron - like fermi pockets in the brillouin zone .",
    "such cdw or sdw transitions can be described as peierls transitions due to fermi surface nesting .",
    "an alternative way to understand cdw or sdw transitions in the electronic systems is the theory for excitonic insulators that was proposed nearly half a century ago .",
    "@xcite since the electron and hole concentrations are relatively low , coulomb interaction between holes and electrons in the fermi pockets is weakly screened and stabilizes electron - hole bound states ( excitons ) with wave vector @xmath2 . in the peierls picture and the excitonic insulator picture for metallic systems ,",
    "the cdw or sdw transitions are basically bcs type . on the other hand",
    ", the theory of excitonic insulators can be extended to semiconductors where excitons are formed due to coulomb interaction between valence band holes and conduction band electrons and undergo bec .",
    "very recently , bcs - bec crossover of excitonic insulator has been examined in more advanced calculations using such as mott - wannier - type exciton model with @xmath3-matrix approximation @xcite and extended falicov - kimball model ( efkm ) .",
    "@xcite if the normal state above the excitonic transition temperature is semimetallic namely the magnitude of the band gap @xmath4 , the excitonic transition is well described in the bcs framework . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitonic transition is expected to be a bec of excitons if the normal state is semiconducting or @xmath5 as schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the bec regime with @xmath5 , large amount of excitons",
    "are preformed above the excitonic transition temperature and the excitonic transition corresponds to the bec of excitons .",
    "the bec transition temperature of excitons can be much higher than those of liquid he or cold atoms since the electron and hole masses are much smaller than atomic masses .",
    "therefore , the bec regime of the excitonic insulator can provide a unique opportunity to study `` high temperature '' bec .",
    "real materials studied in relevance to excitonic insulator states are limited to several rare - earth or transition - metal calcogenides such as tm(se , te ) @xcite and @xmath6-tise@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the possible excitonic insulator transition in tm(se , te ) has been studied using various transport measurements including electrical resistivity @xcite and heat conductivity . @xcite",
    "although the increase of electrical resistivity at the transition and the increase of heat conductivity at the low temperature are assigned to the bec and the superfluidity of excitons respectively , the excitonic insulator transition in tm(se , te ) is not established well due to the lack of quantitative theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the cdw transition in semimetallic @xmath6-tise@xmath0 , which has hole - like ( electron - like ) fermi pockets at the zone center ( boundary ) , has been identified as a bcs - like excitonic insulator transition by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "@xcite the bcs - like excitonic transition in @xmath6-tise@xmath0 is a semimetal - to - semimetal transition due to the small off - stoichiometry or the small difference between the hole and electron densities .",
    "therefore , it is rather difficult to characterize the excitonic transition by means of transport measurement , and the band dispersion observed by arpes is the very direct evidence of the excitonic transition .",
    "the bcs - like excitonic transition can be described by the mean - field theory and the arpes result can be compared with the theoretical calculation . @xcite as for the bec - like excitonic transition , it has been proposed that ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 would have an excitonic insulator transition in the bec regime based on the arpes results below the transition temperature .",
    "@xcite the bec - like excitonic transition is an insulator - insulator transition , and it is rather difficult to identify the bec of excitons using transport measurement .",
    "similar to the bcs - like excitonic transition in @xmath6-tise@xmath0 , the band dispersion observed by arpes can be one of the most straightforward evidence of the excitonic transition .",
    "namely , the single particle excitation can be a finger print of the excitonic bec just like the opening of superconducting gap in the bec of cooper pairs .",
    "however , the bec regime of the excitonic insulator transition can not be described by the mean - field theory and , therefore , a new theory beyond mean - field approximation should be developed and compared with the arpes result in order to establish the excitonic insulator transition in the bec regime . in this sense ,",
    "the bec - like excitonic transition is not well established yet in any real materials including ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(b ) , ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 has a quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) structure where ni and ta atoms are arranged in one dimensional chains .",
    "@xcite resistivity of ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 is insulating below 500 k and exhibits an anomaly around 325 k which is assigned as second - order or weak first - order structural phase transition without cdw .",
    "the resistivity exhibits insulating behaviors both above and below the transition temperature at 325 k. the magnetic susceptibility shows a gradual drop around 325 k suggesting spin singlet formation .",
    "the flattening and sharpening of the valence band top in insulating ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 suggests that the phase transition at 325 k corresponds to an excitonic insulator transition in the bec regime .",
    "in addition , ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 is unique in that the excitons are formed between the electrons and holes that are located in spatially separated chains : i.e. , holes in the ni chain and electrons in the two neighboring ta chains in the quasi-1d structural units , which has an interesting similarity with the 2d bilayer electron systems of semiconductors where the electrons and holes are also spatially separated @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have developed a finite temperature variational cluster approximation ( vca ) methods on efkm for ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 and have applied it to interpret temperature - dependent arpes results of ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 across the transition and to reveal the nature of the transition in this material .",
    "in order to include the electron correlation effects on the single - particle excitation spectra of ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 across the excitonic insulator transition , we have employed vca calculations on efkm which is known as a minimal lattice model to describe the excitonic insulator state . @xcite the ta 5@xmath7 and ni 3@xmath7 orbital degeneracy at the conduction - band bottom and the valence - band top is removed due to the quasi - one - dimensional structure .",
    "@xcite therefore , in order to describe the excitonic condensation and spectral function of valence - band top , the coulomb interaction between the valence - band hole and the conduction - band electron is enough and , consequently , the efkm with non - degenerate and spinless conduction and valence bands is sufficient .",
    "the hamiltonian of the efkm @xcite is given as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) denotes the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron on the @xmath11-orbital ( corresponding to the ta 5@xmath7 conduction band ) at site @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the particle number operator .",
    "@xmath14 represents the spatially anisotropic hopping integral between neighboring sites parallel ( @xmath15 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath16 ) to the one - dimensional chain direction , as it is realized in the quasi - one - dimensional material ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 .",

    "@xmath19 is the on - site energy split between the @xmath11- and @xmath17-orbitals and @xmath20 is the inter - orbital coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "note that @xmath20 can be considered as inter - orbital electron - hole attraction and thus can drive the excitonic insulator state in this model at low temperature .",
    "the effect of the electron - lattice interaction has been examined in ref . @xcite and it has been found that the electron - lattice interaction plays a secondary role and helps the excitonic transition driven by the electron - hole interaction .",
    "@xcite the chemical potential @xmath21 is determined so as to maintain the average particle density at half filling .",
    "the order parameter is given by    @xmath22    we use a parameter set of @xmath23ev , @xmath24ev , @xmath25ev , and @xmath26ev so as to reproduce the single - particle excitation spectrum observed in arpes for ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 and the transition temperature at the same time .",
    "the dependence on the cluster size of the calculated results was checked by changing the cluster size such as the one - dimensional 4- , 5- , 6-site ( 8- , 10- , and 12-orbital ) clusters , where each site contains a pair of the @xmath11- and @xmath17-orbitals , and no significant cluster - size dependence was found . here",
    ", it should be noted that this parameter set corresponds to the semimetallic state in the non - interacting ( @xmath27 ) limit while it can describe the semiconducting state due to the hartree shift by @xmath20 .",
    "the vca  @xcite with its finite temperature algorithm was employed to calculate the temperature dependence of the excitonic order parameter and the single - particle excitation spectra . here",
    ", let us describe the formulation of the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) at finite temperature used in this article .",
    "first we briefly review the rigorous variational principle for the thermodynamic potential functional derived by luttinger and ward  @xcite and revisited by potthoff .",
    "@xcite it has been shown by potthoff  @xcite that the thermodynamic potential functional as a functional of the self - energy can be written as @xmath28 = { \\cal f } [ { \\boldsymbol}{\\sigma } ] - { \\mathrm}{tr } \\ln \\left ( -{\\boldsymbol}{g}_{0}^{-1 } + { \\boldsymbol}{\\sigma } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 $ ] is the legendre transform of the luttinger - ward functional @xmath30 $ ] ,  @xcite @xmath31 is the non - interacting green s function , and the self - energy @xmath32 is considered as a trial function for the variational calculation described below .",

    "@xcite    the self - energy functional theory ( sft )  @xcite provides a way to compute @xmath37 by using the fact that the functional form of @xmath29 $ ] depends only on the interaction terms of the hamiltonian . in sft",
    ", the original lattice is divided into disconnected finite - size clusters and the reference system is introduced as their collection .",
    "the clusters form a superlattice and have the same interaction term as the original system because the interaction term of the hamiltonian of the extended falicov - kimball model [ efkm , eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] is local in real space .",
    "therefore the functional form @xmath38 $ ] of the reference system is the same for that of the original system .",
    "the exact thermodynamic potential of the reference system is given by @xmath39 - { \\mathrm}{tr } \\ln ( -{\\boldsymbol}{g}{'}_{0}^{-1 } + { \\boldsymbol}{\\sigma}')$ ] , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the non - interacting green s function and the exact self - energy of the reference system , respectively .",

    "@xcite in the cpt , the single - particle green s function is given as @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) denotes the orbital index , @xmath63 is the position of the @xmath12-th site within a cluster , and @xmath64^{-1 } \\right)^{\\alpha \\alpha}\\ ] ] is the cpt green s function @xcite .",

    "the resistivity exhibits insulating behaviors both above and below the transition . if temperature dependence of resistivity is given by a simple activation type function @xmath82 with band gap of @xmath83 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 provides magnitude of @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath83 is estimated to be @xmath74 1000 k which is consistent with the magnitude of the gap observed by arpes .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility shows a gradual drop around 325 k which can be assigned to the gradual increase of the band gap due to the excitonic coupling between the valence band hole and the conduction band electron .",
    "figure 3 shows temperature dependence of arpes spectra around the @xmath85 point . in order to capture the temperature evolution of the band dispersions , the valence - band - peak positions evaluated from the energy distribution curves ( which are indicated by the dots with the error bars in fig .",

    "the model function @xmath86 for the excitonic insulator band dispersion is obtained as below .",
    "@xmath87 here , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the bare valence and conduction bands derived by a tight - binding model free from excitonic interaction . in the tight - binding model ,",
    "the ni - se and ta chains are considered to form one - dimensional band dispersion along the chain direction only through their nearest neighbor transfer integrals @xmath90 and @xmath91 without inter - chain hybridization .",
    "assuming linear temperature dependence of the chemical potential , the model function @xmath86 is fitted to the valence - band - peak positions to optimize @xmath90 and the excitonic insulator order parameter @xmath92 as adjustable parameters .",
    "the fitting results are shown by the thick solid curves in fig .",
    "3 , indicating that the fits are reasonably good to extract @xmath92 as a function of temperature .",
    "the bare valence - band dispersion @xmath88 without the excitonic coupling is indicated by the thin solid curves in fig .",
    "overall valence - band dispersions observed by arpes are consistent with the tight - binding or lda band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "however , there is a prominent discrepancy near the top of the valence band located at the @xmath85 point where characteristically flat band dispersion is observed as shown in fig .",
    "this flat band dispersion reminds the experimental arpes result of @xmath6-tise@xmath0 which is one of the candidate materials for showing excitonic insulator transition .",
    "@xcite the experimentally observed bands of @xmath6-tise@xmath0 reported in the arpes measurement @xcite are well reproduced by bcs - like theoretical calculation assuming the excitonic insulator transition to be the origin of its cdw transition .",
    "@xcite paying attention to this similarity with @xmath6-tise@xmath0 , the ground state of ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 can be viewed as an excitonic insulator state , in which ni @xmath93-se @xmath18 valence band and ta @xmath94 conduction band hybridize each other due to electron - hole coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite in order to discuss the nature of the transition to the excitonic insulator state , we now analyze the temperature - dependent arpes results across the transition @xcite on the basis of finite temperature vca calculations on efkm .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows temperature dependence in the second derivative plots of the arpes energy distribution curves along the ta and ni chain directions .",
    "the second derivative plots at 40 k , 260 k , and 340 k are compared with the single - particle spectral function obtained by the vca calculations on efkm for 40 k , 270 k , and 340 k which are displayed in fig .",
    "the flat - top valence band at 40 k is well reproduced by the calculation on the efkm with the appropriate parameter set as well as the previous mean - field calculation on the multi - band hubbard model . @xcite experimentally , as the temperature increases , the area of the flat band region in the momentum space decreases and the band top becomes closer to the fermi level ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the band dispersion deviates from the parabolic behavior and the flattening of the band top still remains even at 340 k which is above the transition temperature .",
    "this situation is well explained by the present vca calculation including the correlation effect beyond the mean - field or bcs limit .",
    "here , it should be noted that the flat band dispersion at 40 k exhibits a dip at the @xmath85 point which is explained by the vca calculation on the q-1d efkm .    by fitting the band positions to the band dispersion renormalized in a mean - field treatment assuming the excitonic insulator order parameter as indicated in fig . 4 , one can decompose the temperature dependence of the band top energy into the temperature dependence of @xmath92 ( due to the electron - hole interaction ) and the temperature dependence of the bare valence band .",
    "the energy distribution curves ( edcs ) of the @xmath85 point at 40 k , 260 k , and 340 k ( from which the temperature dependence of the bare valence band is subtracted ) are compared with the calculated spectra for 40 k , 270 k , and 340 k in fig .",
    "as the temperature increases , the edc peak position is shifted towards lower binding energy and the edc peak width of the flat band becomes broader .",
    "the substantial spectral broadening is reminiscent of the breaking of the quasi - particle peak structure , namely , the breaking of the bec .",
    "the broadening is similar to that observed in the pseudogap region of the high @xmath96 cuprates although the cuprate case is more complicated with the pseudogap assigned to a possible competing order instead of the fluctuation of cooper pairs .",
    "@xcite figure 5(b ) shows the temperature dependence of the order parameter @xmath92 and @xmath97 ( the energy position of the spectral peak relative to @xmath95 at the @xmath85 point ) obtained from the calculation .",
    "firstly , the value of @xmath98 is approximately 10 indicating that the present transition falls in the strong coupling regime .",
    "secondly , @xmath97 remains finite even above the phase transition temperature as observed in the experiment showing that @xmath99 due to the hartree shift by @xmath20 .",
    "thirdly , the band flattening remains even above the transition temperature indicating the excitonic fluctuation .",
    "interestingly , the strong coupling nature and the strong fluctuation above the transition in ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 are very similar to the recent arpes observation on the strong coupling superconductivity with a pseudo - gap behavior in fese@xmath100te@xmath101 . @xcite the exciton fluctuation above the phase transition temperature is even indicated in a semimetal @xmath6-tise@xmath0 system which is thought to fall in the bcs regime of the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite the present vca calculation with fluctuation effect shows that the preformed exciton region in the conventional phase diagram [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] corresponds to the pseudo - gap phase with strong excitonic fluctuation .",
    "in addition , the transition - metal @xmath94 or rare - earth @xmath102 orbitals with spin and orbital degrees freedom under strong spin - orbit interaction can provide a variety of spin - orbit coupled condensates derived from their band gap structures and spin - orbital dependent coulomb interactions .",
    "therefore , the excitonic insulators including ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 will provide a new playground to explore physics of bcs - bec crossover in various bosonic systems with spin and orbital degrees freedom which have been attracting great interest due to the new discoveries in the ultracold atom systems .",
    "in summary , the transition to the excitonic insulator state in ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 has been identified as a bec of excitons based on the comparison between the finite temperature vca calculations and the arpes results .",
    "a flat dispersion around the top of the valence band was observed and assigned as the effect of excitonic coupling between the valence and conduction bands .",
    "as the system exceeds the transition temperature , the flat feature of the valence band weakens though the exciton fluctuations remain finite which is due to the strong fluctuation effect expected in the bec character of the excitonic insulator transition from the semiconductor phase .",
