    "the problem of extensional ( mode i ) fracture has received increasing attention in the physics community in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "the experiments in amorphous materials done by fineberg , et al .",
    "@xcite and in ordered materials by hauch , et al .",
    "@xcite , showing interesting dynamical behavior for large velocity cracks have been at the center of this growing interest . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the singularities at the crack tip associated with continuum treatments of the crack make the problem challenging .",
    "the presence of these singularities necessitates a treatment of the crack tip at the microscopic level , the singularities being regularized by the small scale dynamics .",
    "one line of attack on this problem , initiated by slepyan  @xcite , has been through the study of lattice models of cracks .",
    "these lattice models are simpler than full atomistic simulations  @xcite in that the connectivity of the atoms is specified from the beginning , and so dislocations are excluded .",
    "much progress has been made in understanding steady - state propagation of cracks in lattice systems using an ideally - brittle piece - wise linear force law  @xcite . here",
    "the particles interact with hookean springs , which break at some critical extension , after which they exert no force . with these piece - wise - linear interactions",
    ", the model admits an analytic solution via the wiener - hopf technique .",
    "this solution has been carried out both for mode iii and mode i cracks , for both finite width and infinitely wide systems , with and without dissipation ( stokes or kelvin type ) .",
    "there have also been some recent results on mode ii cracks , with possible relevance for an understanding of friction  @xcite    the piece - wise linear model , despite its analytic simplicity , exhibits some undesirable features  @xcite . for small dissipation ,",
    "the solutions are inconsistent at small velocities , in that bonds on the crack surface which are assumed to crack at time some specific time in fact are seen to reach the critical displacement and hence to crack earlier . at large velocities ,",
    "the analytic solutions are again inconsistent , this time due to the breaking of additional bonds off the nominal crack surface . beyond this point ,",
    "the analytic methods are unable to tell us anything about the true dynamics of the system .",
    "an additional limitation of the piece - wise - linear force law is that it greatly complicates the task of constructing a linear stability treatment of the steady - state crack .",
    "this is due of course to the discontinuous nature of the force law .",
    "for the case of mode iii fracture , kessler and levine  @xcite studied a lattice model with a family of continuous non - linear force laws labeled by a tunable smoothness parameter @xmath0 .",
    "such continuous forces should presumably more closely model the actual physical situation . with this lattice model",
    ", they investigated both arrested cracks  @xcite and propagating cracks  @xcite .",
    "consistent steady - state solutions were found at all driving ; the previously discovered inconsistent solutions at large driving of the piece - wise linear limit were converted to consistent but linearly unstable solutions for the continuous force law .    in this paper",
    "we will study mode i fracture with a suitable adaptation to vector forces of this class of continuous force law .",
    "we shall study steady - state solutions of the model both for small and large driving , and their dependence on the dissipation , the critical bond extension ( relative to the lattice constant ) and smoothness .",
    "our results will be compared those of both the piece - wise linear limit mode i calculations  @xcite and the continuous force mode iii analysis  @xcite .",
    "we shall also study the instabilities of the theory at large driving , finding a number of transitions between dominant modes as a function of dissipation ; these findings will be confirmed by direct numerical simulations . we will also briefly consider the nature of the dynamics , post - instability . finally , we shall draw some conclusions and discuss directions for further research .",
    "in this paper we study extensional ( mode i ) cracks in a nonlinear , two dimension hexagonal lattice model .",
    "mass points located at the lattice sites are coupled to their six nearest - neighbors by nonlinear , viscoelastic central forces .",
    "the force that particle @xmath1 exerts on particle @xmath2 is taken to be : @xmath3}{% 1+\\tanh ( \\alpha ) } \\ \\hat{r}_{1,2}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the lattice scale , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the distance between the atoms and @xmath7 .",
    "the threshold @xmath8 is the distance between the atoms at which the spring can be considered to break .",
    "@xmath9 is a parameter that determines the smoothness of the potential . in the limit @xmath10",
    "the force becomes perfectly brittle , dropping immediately to @xmath11 as @xmath12 exceeds @xmath13 .",
    "decreasing @xmath0 smoothes the force , so that it decays away over a distance @xmath14 .",
    "now the bonds never crack totally , there is always some ( exponentially small ) force , even at large @xmath12 .",
    "note that , compared with the similar force law studied at mode iii  @xcite , this model has an additional parameter , namely @xmath15 the ratio of the lattice constant to the breaking extension ; this parameter governs the extent to which the force direction changes as the displacement grows . only in the joint limit @xmath16 , @xmath17",
    "do we recover the piece - wise linear force law studied in mode i by kulamekhtova , saraikin and slepyan  @xcite , marder and liu  @xcite and pechenik , kessler and levine  @xcite . in the following",
    "we choose our length scale such that @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the purely conservative force , we introduce a kelvin - type viscosity with a viscosity parameter @xmath19 with the force law  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is an effective spring constant : @xmath23 these forces define our model .",
    "we can now write the equation of motion for the displacement @xmath24 of a mass point away from its lattice position : @xmath25",
    "we work on a hexagonal lattice with @xmath26 rows in the @xmath27 direction , indexed by @xmath28 .",
    "the rows are separated by a distance @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 .",
    "we apply a constant displacement @xmath31 to the top- and bottom - most rows .",
    "the ( metastable ) uncracked state is that of uniform strain @xmath32 in the equilibrium cracked state , the upper half of the rows have @xmath33 , and the lower half @xmath34 .",
    "initially , we will be interested in the case of steady state cracks where the displacement has the slepyan form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 label the position of a particle on the lattice , and @xmath37 is the crack propagation speed  @xcite .",
    "this ansatz reduces the problem to one of solving for the time development of the displacement for just @xmath38 particles , i.e. one particle on each of the unconstrained rows .",
    "in addition , we focus on symmetric cracks so we need consider just one side of the lattice , imposing the symmetry condition :  @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    as opposed to the previous analyses done in the piece - wise linear limit ( @xmath41 )  @xcite , here with finite @xmath42 we must resort to a numerical procedure . specifically , we discretize time using a small but finite @xmath43 , and further limit @xmath44 .",
    "this reduces the problem to a set of @xmath45 ) coupled equations . since the equations of motion are dependent only on nearest neighbors , the system has a banded structure .",
    "the equations of motions are nonlinear so we use newton s method to solve the problem , using standard subroutines for solving banded matrices to find the newton update .",
    "now , for each given @xmath37 of the crack , we want to find the driving displacement @xmath46 .",
    "we have @xmath47 unknowns ( the @xmath48 vector functions for the entire time range plus @xmath46 ) ; this is one more than the number of equations , reflecting the time - translation invariance of the sought - after solution .",
    "thus we add an additional equation fixing @xmath49 to lift the degeneracy .",
    "let us note that it can be shown that the discretized problem has one more linear mode that diverges as @xmath50 than diverges at @xmath51 to treat this , we enforce the equation of motion for @xmath52 whereas the variable run from @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "the system then has @xmath54 bands below the diagonal and @xmath55 upper bands , where @xmath56 is a even number with @xmath57    the only remaining technical issue is that the system as presented does not have a completely banded structure due to the fact that many equations depend on @xmath46 .",
    "this problem can be circumvented using the algorithm of kessler and levine ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that smoothing out the potential can have a large effect in the small velocity regime . in particular",
    ", the fact that solutions in the piece - wise linear limit become inconsistent at small enough velocity means that making @xmath0 finite must make a significant difference . for mode",
    "iii  ( @xcite ) , decreasing @xmath0 eliminated the oscillations in the @xmath58 curve , in accord with this reasoning ; but , the oscillations were already not present at large enough @xmath19 and thus changing @xmath9 has almost no effect on those steady - state curves .",

    "@xmath46 is normalized by the griffith value , @xmath70 , the value for which fracture is energetically allowed .",
    "this value is a function of @xmath42 and of course @xmath48 .",
    "data is presented for @xmath64 because computing the very low velocity solutions is very hard at large @xmath48 , due to the bandwidth which scale as @xmath71 .",
    "we do not expect the picture at larger @xmath48 to be qualitatively different  @xcite .",
    "at small @xmath72 the curves have oscillations for all @xmath73 , unlike the mode iii case , where oscillations were present only for large @xmath9 . at large @xmath9 , in both cases",
    "the graphs are qualitatively similar to those obtained directly in the piece - wise linear limit(pll ) , though the large @xmath0 curves do not actually converge to those curves .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned fact that the solutions of the pll are actually inconsistent for small velocity whereas the solutions of the finite @xmath0 model are always well - defined  @xcite .",
    "as we increase @xmath72 the oscillations disappear and the curves become smoother .",
    "this behavior , as can be seen in the @xmath74  data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) , happens for all @xmath9 , but is especially pronounced for the smaller @xmath9 s as expected .",
    "these trends are also seen in the mode iii case  @xcite . as we increase @xmath19 to still higher values , for example @xmath75 , ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) , a maximal velocity can be seen at small @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of a maximal velocity in steady - state cracks is a general feature , and will be discussed at length in the next section on the large velocity regime .",
    "here we just note that for large @xmath19 and small @xmath0 , the maximal velocity can be quite low , e.g. @xmath76 at @xmath77 , @xmath66 , @xmath78 , and decreases for decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior has no parallel in the mode iii case .",
    "at small @xmath79 , decreasing @xmath0 increases the velocity , but for large @xmath79 the situation is reversed , with the curves with the smaller @xmath9 having lower velocity .",
    "this is a result of the fact that in our nonlinear potential the bonds never really break and continue to impede the crack s progress . on the other hand , at small @xmath79 ,",
    "small @xmath0 weakens the lattice trapping effect , resulting in larger velocity than for larger @xmath0",
    ".    we still have to address the question of why the curves oscillates at low @xmath0 for small @xmath19 , in contradistinction to the mode iii case  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) the bond extension and the bond force for a representative small velocity case , @xmath80 . in the piece - wise linear case at small @xmath72 for",
    "both mode i and mode iii the underdamping of the backward running waves leads to pre - cracking .",
    "this means that the bond extension rises above unity ( @xmath81 before @xmath82 and then comes back to unity before cracking once and for all  @xcite . for finite @xmath83 , while there can not be any pre - cracking ( we do nt have to postulate in advance when a bond will break ) , there is a remnant of this tendency . after cracking ,",
    "the bond extension first rises and then falls to a value close to the critical extension before rising again and then permanently leaving the region close to critical extension .",
    "this force oscillation is ultimately what is responsible for the oscillations in the @xmath58 plot .",
    "this situation is very different from that in mode iii , where for finite @xmath9 , the bond extension increases monotonically through the critical region .    , for @xmath84 and @xmath61 . in both figures , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "we present the data on fig .",
    "[ figext ] .",
    "we see that there is no dramatic effect of the lattice scale constant in the small velocity regime .",
    "there is a backward branch for all @xmath4 at about the same velocity , with the effect accentuated at large @xmath4 .",
    "in the large velocity regime , it is again clear that smoothing the potential must make significant modifications to the steady state solutions , as it is known that in the piece - wise linear model the solution is inconsistent due to the breaking of bonds off the assumed crack surface .",
    "this inconsistency was demonstrated both for mode iii in a square lattice and mode i in a hexagonal lattice , the case treated herein  @xcite . in mode",
    "iii , the inconsistency in the pll is converted to a linear instability for the finite @xmath0 model .",

    "the velocity grows smoothly with @xmath46 . for @xmath91",
    "the curve still grows but a little bit less smoothly with some small kinks appearing .",
    "there is no sign of a maximal velocity , at least for the range of @xmath79 investigated ; the maximal velocity , if it exists , is close to the rayleigh wave speed .",
    "as we go lower in @xmath9 , at @xmath88 , and more significantly at @xmath92 and @xmath77 , the curves lie significantly below those for the larger @xmath0 .",
    "we see here a maximal velocity far below the rayleigh wave speed .",
    "these changes are a direct sign of the involvement of the additional bonds in the crack progression ; in particular , the creation of a local maximum of the velocity as a function of @xmath79 is due to the fact that this involvement grows with @xmath79 and can overcompensate for the natural tendency of the crack to speed up as the applied stress increases .    in the previous figure ,",
    "the lattice scale @xmath4 was kept fixed .",
    "if we increase @xmath4 , the maximal velocity decreases and is no longer near the rayleigh wave speed even at larger @xmath9 .",

    "it should be noted , the critical velocity for the onset of instabilities appears to be material dependent@xcite .",
    "thus , this strong dependence is an encouraging sign .",

    "given the steady - state solution , we can proceed to investigate its linear stability .",
    "we will focus here on the instability in the high velocity regime ; it is clear that in the low velocity regime where the @xmath98 curve is backward , the solutions are unstable .",
    "we take the form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the traveling wave coordinate @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the steady state displacements for row @xmath103that we have found in the last chapter .",

    "also @xmath115 for any @xmath116 s that correspond to times before or after the limiting values of @xmath100 that were selected to build the steady - state solution .",
    "second , we add a normalization condition by setting @xmath117 ; there are now as many equations as variables if one includes @xmath118 among the latter .",
    "then , as in the steady state solution , we need to solve a set of ( now complex ) linear equations with an almost banded structure , where now @xmath111 is the variable that destroys the banded structure .",
    "to proceed , we choose some ( complex ) value of @xmath111 , and temporarily ignore the actual equation of motion for the @xmath27 component of @xmath119 , replacing it by the aforementioned normalization condition .",
    "we then solve the banded system of linear equations by standard techniques .",
    "we still have left the equation of motion we have dropped , which serves as a complex mismatch function ; the zeroes of this mismatch function determine the eigenvalues of @xmath111 .",
    "we are of course interested in the eigenvalue with largest real part , which is the dominant mode .",
    "when we solve the system of equations for the linear stability analysis , we do not impose any symmetry on the problem ; i.e. we use the complete lattice encompassing both sides of the crack .",
    "let us note that any time we find a complex root of @xmath111 , with eigenfunctions @xmath120 , there is always an equivalent solution generated by the transformation : @xmath121    by even and odd we mean the serial number of the row , for example row @xmath11 is the first even row .",
    "this alternation is due to the shift of @xmath122 for the @xmath116-values in neighboring rows .    to test our stability analysis we check whether our linear equations reproduce the time translation mode that should be always be present with eigenvalue @xmath123 , and eigenfunction @xmath124 given our discrete @xmath125",
    ", we found the eigenvalue of the translation mode to lie not exactly at zero , but still quite small ; e.g. , typically @xmath126 for @xmath127 note that compared to the case of mode iii , the matrix here is larger as we have two components of the displacement field furthermore , the critical velocity here is much smaller than the mode iii case , so @xmath56 is larger .",
    "it was therefore difficult to work at @xmath89 as we did for the steady state solution .",
    "the stability matrix is complex as opposed to real , and we do not impose any symmetry on the problem ; hence the matrix is now four times bigger than in the steady state solution case .",

    "the critical velocity for small @xmath72 increases with @xmath72 , as in the piece - wise linear model ( where here the critical velocity denotes the onset of inconsistency ) ; even the values are similar . as we increase @xmath19 further , the critical velocity decreases , again just like the piece - wise linear results , due there to the breaking of a horizontal bond  @xcite .",

    "to check our results , both for the steady state solution and for the linear stability analysis we have implemented a direct numerical simulation of the initial value problem .",
    "these simulations are also useful for investigating the dynamics after the point of instability .",
    "our system is a hexagonal lattice with @xmath157 rows and with a finite number , @xmath158 , of mass points in each row .",
    "the top and bottom rows are constrained to have a displacement @xmath159 .",
    "the initial conditions for the displacement and velocity for the lattice were constructed from the steady state solution that we already have found , with the initial crack tip placed @xmath160 from the left edge .",
    "we solve the equations of motion by an euler scheme , taking @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "we measured the velocity of the crack by monitoring the bond extension .",
    "the crack was considered to have translated forward when both bonds connecting a given mass point to its neighbors across the midline exceeded the critical extension , @xmath163 , and the velocity determined from the time @xmath164 between such translation events , @xmath165 .",
    "this criterion of velocity is of course somewhat arbitrary because cracking in our smooth potential is a reversible process .",
    "note that to produce a true steady state crack we need to fix @xmath166 so that it is an integer multiple of @xmath43 .",
    "otherwise we would introduce oscillations in @xmath164 due to the incommensurability . via this procedure",
    ", we obtained excellent agreement ( with 4 digit accuracy ) between the simulated and calculated results for the @xmath58 relationship .",
    "as we increase @xmath46 , we can follow the @xmath58 curve and we obtain from the simulation all the points of the curve including those around the @xmath37-maximum .",
    "when we get exactly to the point of instability as predicted from the linear stability analysis , additional bond breaking occurs , and the velocity in the simulation drops down below the steady - state curve .    the numerical simulation can provide a strong check on the details of the stability analysis . we can measure the eigenfrequency by perturbing one mass point on the lattice in the vicinity of the crack tip , and measuring the subsequent time development of the perturbation .",
    "we track the bond extension of the breaking bond at the moment of cracking . because of the finiteness of @xmath43 this is always somewhat larger than @xmath13 .",
    "this value oscillates , decaying in the stable regime , and growing in the unstable regime .",

    "the oscillating part in the simulation fits well to the imaginary part of the linear stability eigenvalue .",
    "we note that throughout the unstable regime we can detect the presence of the square of the unstable mode , giving rise to an additional non - linear mode whose real part is two times the value of the real part of the eigenvalue .",
    "when we increase @xmath46 past the point of instability , the actual crack dynamics of the problem become increasingly complex .",
    "direct numerical simulation an still be used to study crack development .",
    "we performed such a study using @xmath172 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] three examples of what can happen in mode i cracking after the point of instability , for increasing values of @xmath79 , all for the case of small dissipation . for the smallest @xmath79",
    ", the crack tip meanders up and down off the midline . for larger @xmath79 , the crack starts to bifurcate ( fig . [ fig10](b ) ) , and at the highest @xmath79 shown bifurcates many times and creates a very complex cracking picture ( fig . [ fig10](c ) ) . in all three of these small @xmath19 cases , the crack arrests eventually . at large @xmath19 , such as @xmath173 and higher ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) the picture is very different . just above the point of instability the crack bifurcates , with the two daughter tips propagating close to the edges of the system .",
    "these kinds of behavior appear to be very different from that seen in experiment , where there is a main crack propagating more or less straight in addition to daughter cracks on either side .    in the mode",
    "iii case , a crucial point that emerged from the detailed linear stability study was that the additional cracking bonds were always created behind the crack tip .",
    "there , the instability did not divert the main crack , but merely slowed it down temporarily as energy was diverted to create the sidebranches  @xcite . here in mode",
    "i cracking , however , after the point of instability the crack tip itself changes direction and the crack either bifurcates or deviates from the center .",
    "we have herein studied the steady - state crack , calculating the @xmath98 curves both for small and large driving , and for small and large dissipation . for small",
    "driving with small dissipation , we obtained oscillating curves for all finite @xmath0 , indicating a substantial velocity gap at small velocity . at large dissipation , the curves are smooth , and vary significantly with @xmath0 . at large driving , the maximal velocity exhibits a strong dependence on the smoothness and the value of @xmath15 . for large @xmath19 , there is also a maximal driving as the curve bends back forming a second branch , and beyond which no steady - state solution exists . for all @xmath19 ,",
    "the steady - state solution undergoes a linear instability . for large @xmath19 , this occurs at the maximal driving , and is a real instability . for small @xmath19 ,",
    "the instability set in slightly after the maximal velocity , and is a hopf bifurcation .",
    "the velocity at the onset of instability initially increases with @xmath19 , reaches a maximum at @xmath174 and thereafter decreases for larger @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the strong variation of the velocity at the onset of instability with the microscopic parameters does not accord with the naive expectations based on the yoffe continuum calculation@xcite of a change in the direction of maximal stress at some universal velocity , independent of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "it also is not accord with the ansatz of eshelby based on energy considerations  @xcite .",
    "we also compared our steady state solution and linear stability analysis to direct numerical simulations , obtaining excellent agreement .",
    "we plan to extend our work to the case of biaxial loading , where the material in strained in both the @xmath116 and @xmath27 direction .",
    "this phenomena describes for example a popping of a balloon as described in ref .",
    "we also plan to investigate further the post - instability dynamics .",
    "finally , we hope to use the recently introduced  @xcite continuum regularization of tip - dynamics ( based on the phase - field method ) to unravel the role that the lattice structure has in determining the form of the allowed instabilities .        for a review ,",
