    "the heegaard floer homology package is a powerful collection of invariants of knots , links , and @xmath1 and @xmath2manifolds .",
    "although the generators of the chain complexes used to define these invariants are combinatorial , the differential involves a count of j - holomorphic curves in a symplectic manifold . until recently",
    ", there was no combinatorial method to perform this count .    in 2006 , sarkar made the revolutionary observation that if a particular type of heegaard diagram could be found , a general enumeration of the holomorphic curves counted by the resulting chain complex or chain map was possible . to describe this method , recall that a pointed heegaard diagram is a collection of data : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a closed heegaard surface for a three - manifold @xmath5 , @xmath6 are collections of simple closed curves bounding disks in the heegaard splitting , and @xmath7 is a collection of points which can be used to specify knots and links in @xmath5 .",
    "sarkar showed that if all the connected components ( regions ) of @xmath8 are @xmath9 or @xmath2sided polygons then any holomorphic curve relevant to the differential could be identified combinatorially , via a formula of lipshitz @xcite .    in this level of generality",
    "it is clear , however , that the idea can not work for every example .",
    "this is because the sphere and torus are the only surfaces which can be decomposed as cell complexes consisting solely of polygons with @xmath9 or @xmath2 sides , while the only @xmath1manifolds with heegaard genus @xmath10 or @xmath11 are the lens spaces . in @xcite ,",
    "sarkar and wang exhibit an algorithm to compute a restricted version ( the so - called `` hat '' theory ) of the knot floer homology for an arbitrary @xmath1manifold by finding a heegaard diagram with a single `` bad '' region ( many - sided polygon ) which is not counted in the differential .",
    "on the other hand , restricting to knots in lens spaces allows for a computation of the full range of invariants .    in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "this approach was taken in a paper of manolescu , ozsvth , and sarkar @xcite .",
    "in addition to allowing for the computation of the filtered chain homotopy type of @xmath12 - the most robust of the knot and link invariants - their approach was ground - breaking in its combinatorial simplicity .",
    "indeed , generators are identified with elements of @xmath13 , the symmetric group on @xmath14 letters , and differentials count domains associated to elements differing by simple transpositions .",
    "possible connections to representation theory are tantalizing .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the combinatorial algorithm for computing the floer homology of knots in @xmath0 in terms of grid diagrams to the case of knots in an arbitrary lens space ( we do not treat the case of @xmath15 here , as the setup is quite different ) .",
    "in fact , the algorithm of @xcite carries over in a somewhat straightforward manner . in section  [ section : griddiagrams ]",
    "we describe grid position for knots in lens spaces and show how to pass from these grid positions to the relevant heegaard diagrams , which we call _ twisted toroidal grid diagrams _ or simply _",
    "grid diagrams_. these are the analogues of the toroidal grid diagrams used by @xcite to compute the floer homology of knots in @xmath0 . the main theorem of this paper is the following :    [ thm : main ]",
    "let @xmath16 be an arbitrary knot in a lens space",
    ". then @xmath17 may be put into grid position and admits an associated twisted toroidal grid diagram . moreover the filtered chain homotopy type of @xmath18 as a @xmath19$]-module can be computed in terms of the combinatorics of the grid diagram .",
    "we postpone a precise description of the resulting chain complex until the next section , but content ourselves here to say that it closely resembles the chain complex for knots in @xmath0 given in @xcite . instead",
    ", we briefly discuss our motivation for the present generalization .",
    "the most obvious motivation for pursuing a combinatorial formula for the knot floer homology invariants of lens space knots is the strength of these invariants .",
    "link floer homology in manifolds other than @xmath0 has been shown to detect the thurston norm of a link complement @xcite,@xcite , whether a knot is fibered @xcite and has had applications to questions related to the concordance classes of knots in @xmath0 through the double - branched covering operation @xcite .",
    "our main motivation , however , is in providing a foundation for a combinatorial approach to the berge conjecture . in @xcite",
    ", berge describes a family of knots , which he calls _",
    "double primitive knots _ , on which one can perform dehn surgery and obtain a lens space .",
    "these knots are characterized by the property that they can be embedded in the heegaard surface of a genus two heegaard splitting of @xmath0 in such a way that they represent a generator of the fundamental group of each handlebody of the splitting .",
    "the berge conjecture is that any knot in @xmath0 which admits a lens space surgery is double primitive , @xcite .    by shifting our perspective to the lens spaces",
    ", one can transform this conjecture into an infinite number of simpler conjectures i.e.  we can try to prove that any knot in @xmath0 on which surgery can produce a particular lens space , say @xmath20 , is double primitive . to make this more precise , note that upon performing the surgery on a double primitive knot @xmath21 which yields a lens space , there is a naturally induced knot @xmath22 in the lens space .",
    "this knot is the core of the solid torus glued to @xmath23 during the surgery .",
    "berge showed that if @xmath21 is double primitive then the induced knot @xmath22 is a member of a particularly simple finite family .",
    "in fact , @xmath24 must be one of the @xmath25 knots which can be realized by a grid diagram of grid number one .",
    "furthermore , if surgery on a grid number one knot @xmath26 yields the three - sphere , then the knot @xmath27 induced by the surgery is double primitive .",
    "( let us say a knot _ has grid number one _ if it may be represented by a grid number one grid diagram . )",
    "thus , we have the following equivalent form of the berge conjecture , which was originally stated as a question @xcite .",
    "@xcite suppose that surgery on @xmath16 yields the three - sphere .",
    "then @xmath17 has grid number one .",
    "one immediately observes that grid number one knots have `` simple knot floer homology '' : @xmath28 since there is a spectral sequence starting with knot floer homology and converging to the floer homology of the ambient three - manifold , the above equality can be informally described as `` grid number one knots have the smallest rank knot floer homology possible '' .",
    "we are then led to consider the following strategy for proving the berge conjecture :    1 .",
    "show that if surgery on @xmath26 yields @xmath0 , then @xmath17 has simple floer homology in the above sense .",
    "2 .   show that if @xmath26 has simple floer homology , then @xmath17 has grid number one .",
    "thus , the strategy can be described succinctly as @xmath29    while at first sight this strategy may appear overly optimistic , we note that the first step has been carried out by the third author @xcite , and independently by rasmussen @xcite :    [ thm : simplehfk]@xcite suppose that surgery on @xmath26 yields @xmath0 and let @xmath30 denote the genus of @xmath17 . then @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore ,    * if @xmath32 then @xmath33 * if @xmath34 then @xmath35    in order for surgery on @xmath17 to produce @xmath0 , @xmath17 must generate @xmath36 .",
    "as @xmath17 is not null - homologous , we should be careful to say what we mean by the genus .",
    "since surgery on @xmath17 produces @xmath0 , the complement @xmath37 is homeomorphic to the complement @xmath38 , for a knot @xmath24 in @xmath0 .",
    "we define @xmath30 to be the seifert genus of @xmath24 .",
    "the berge conjecture would then follow from :    [ conj : gn1 ] suppose that @xmath26 satisfies @xmath39 then @xmath17 has grid number @xmath11 .",
    "[ conj : t ] there are exactly two knots in @xmath40 which satisfy @xmath41    in section @xmath2 of @xcite , two knots @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 are specified for each lens space .",
    "there , it is shown that surgery on @xmath44 can not produce @xmath0 .",
    "thus a proof of the above conjectures , together with theorem  [ thm : simplehfk ] , would indeed prove the berge conjecture .",
    "though our conjectures are quite strong , we note that in the case @xmath45 , we have affirmative answers to the first and a specialization of the second .",
    "[ thm : s3 ] @xcite suppose @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath17 is the unknot ( the only grid number one knot in @xmath0 ) .",
    "[ thm : ghiggini]@xcite",
    "suppose @xmath46 satisfies @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath17 is the right- or left - handed trefoil .",
    "the proofs of the above theorems rely on connections between heegaard floer homology and symplectic geometry and have yet to be understood combinatorially .",
    "such an understanding of theorems  [ thm : s3 ] and  [ thm : ghiggini ] would likely lead to a proof of our conjectures and , hence , of the berge conjecture .",
    "we find it worthwhile to remark that while @xcite provides an algorithm for computing @xmath50 , implementation varies on a knot - by - knot basis and is time - consuming in practice .",
    "the present work has the advantage that the chain complexes are explicit , combinatorial in description , and uniformly implemented .",
    "another key feature is that a combinatorial description of the filtered chain homotopy type of @xmath18 is provided .",
    "this invariant contains strictly more information than the filtered chain homotopy type of @xmath50 and , in particular , is required for formulas which compute the floer homology of closed three - manifolds obtained by dehn surgery along @xmath26 @xcite .      in the next section",
    "we define grid diagrams for knots and links in lens spaces . to a grid diagram for a knot @xmath17 , @xmath51 ,",
    "we associate a module @xmath52 , equipped with an endomorphism @xmath53 , both of which are defined in terms of the combinatorics of these diagrams .",
    "we also associate to elements in @xmath52 three combinatorial quantities @xmath54 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] states that the object we define is a chain complex for the knot floer homology , and that @xmath54 coincide with the @xmath55 , maslov ( homological ) , and alexander gradings on knot floer homology , respectively .",
    "the proof will be divided into a series of propositions :    * proposition  [ prop : boundary ] identifies the ungraded combinatorial object @xmath56 with a chain complex for the knot floer homology .",
    "* proposition  [ prop : spincgrad ] equates the combinatorial quantity @xmath57 with the @xmath55 grading @xmath58 on floer homology .",
    "* proposition  [ prop : maslovgrad ] equates the combinatorial quantity @xmath59 with the maslov grading @xmath60 on floer homology . *",
    "proposition  [ prop : alexgrad ] equates the combinatorial quantity @xmath61 with the alexander grading @xmath62 on knot floer homology .    that the knot floer homology can be computed from grid diagrams",
    "will be more or less straightforward , and proposition  [ prop : boundary ] will follow in the spirit of the analogous theorem for knots in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the work will be in showing that the three combinatorial gradings agree with the @xmath55 , alexander , and maslov gradings , originally defined using vector fields and index theory .    in section @xmath1 , we recall necessary background on heegaard floer theory , paving the way for a proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] in section @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , section @xmath2 contains proofs of the above propositions .",
    "additionally , we prove there ( see proposition  [ prop : existence ] and its corollary ) that every knot in a lens space possesses a grid diagram .",
    "an important technical tool in the proofs will be a correspondence between grid diagrams for knots in lens spaces and grid diagrams for certain links in @xmath0 - the universal cover of @xmath40 ( this correspondence was developed by the second author and her collaborators in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , under the covering projection @xmath63 , a grid diagram for @xmath64 lifts to a grid diagram for a knot @xmath65 , and this lifted diagram can be used together with results of @xcite and @xcite to help establish our grading formulas .",

    "this is equivalent to what we have done : i.e. , chosen coordinates on the fundamental domain @xmath486 with respect to the basis @xmath487 as in @xcite , we will find it convenient to use a bilinear extension of a symmetrized version of the @xmath183 function :          [ lemma : absmasgr ] let @xmath51 be a grid number @xmath14 grid diagram for @xmath16 , and let @xmath490 denote the generator corresponding to the lower left corner of the @xmath491 basepoints . then @xmath492      as in @xcite , we compute the absolute maslov grading of the given generator by connecting it , via a maslov index @xmath10 triangle in a heegaard triple diagram , to a generator whose absolute maslov grading we know .",

    "see also the discussion in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "@xmath499 is @xmath500 , the generator in the lower - left hand corner of @xmath501 .",

    "then from corollary  [ cor : compmas ] it follows that @xmath508 for all @xmath130 , proving proposition  [ prop : maslovgrad ] .",
    "note that since @xmath509 is a homological grading on @xmath18 , it follows that @xmath510 .        by proposition  [ prop : maslovgrad ] , we have @xmath511 .",
    "therefore , it will be sufficient to show that the definition of the alexander grading @xmath62 given in subsection  [ subsec : graddef ] satisfies the stated relationship .",
    "that is , we must show      a proof of the lemma implies , in particular , that the combinatorial definition of @xmath204 defines a filtration on @xmath513 , since this is known to be true for the rational alexander grading @xmath62 .",
    "the articles @xcite and @xcite give combinatorial descriptions of the maslov and alexander gradings for knots and links in @xmath0 and prove these combinatorial definitions match the original definitions .",
    "thus our strategy is to pass to the universal cover of @xmath40 and build a grid diagram for the lift @xmath514 of @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "we then use the behavior of @xmath60 and @xmath62 under covers to prove that the stated relationship holds for generators in the @xmath358pointed heegaard diagram for @xmath40 .",
