    "pairing lies at the core of the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer mechanism for metal superconductivity , and the very natural question to know whether it could survive population imbalances between the two spin states naturally arose very soon after its development @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that pairing was indeed robust to some amount of mismatch between the chemical potentials of the two species , but the fate of the system after the critical imbalance is reached has long been a mystery .",
    "the absence of clear answer to this problem was due in particular to the absence of an experimental system on which the various scenarios envisioned could be tested : existence of a spatially modulated order parameter ( fulde , ferrel , larkin and ovshinikov , or fflo , phases ) @xcite , or the extension to trapped systems@xcite , deformed fermi surfaces @xcite , interior gap superfluidity @xcite , phase separation between a normal and a superfluid state through a first order phase transition @xcite , bcs quasi - particle interactions @xcite or onset of p - wave pairing @xcite .",
    "when the strength of the interactions is varied , a complicated phase diagram mixing several of these scenarios is expected @xcite .",
    "this issue was revived by the possibility of obtaining fermionic superfluids with ultra cold atoms @xcite , where spin imbalance could be controlled and maintained for a long time .",
    "this led to a series of experiments performed at mit @xcite and rice @xcite which clearly demonstrated a phase separation between regions characterized by different polarizations ( i.e. spin population imbalances , by analogy with magnetism ) .",
    "the number of phases obtained by the two groups is however different . in rice experiment ,",
    "the cloud is constituted of a core where both spin populations are equal , surrounded by a shell of majority atoms only while at mit a third phase mixing both species with unequal densities is intercalated between the previous ones , a discrepancy which is not yet fully explained @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we wish to explore the various consequences of these experiments .",
    "by contrast to most recent works on the subject , we would like to avoid the use of bcs mean field , which is known to give good qualitative insight to the problem under study , but fails when precise quantitative estimates are needed .",
    "our scheme is based on a combination of exact variational analysis and monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we will demonstrate that , in agreement with mit experiments , three phases are expected in homogeneous systems . to compare with experimental results",
    ", we will make use of local density approximation ( lda ) which leads to quantitative agreement with mit s data . finally , following @xcite",
    ", we will show how rice s apparently contradictory results can be interpreted as a breakdown of local density approximation in elongated traps .",
    "let us first consider an ensemble of spin 1/2 fermions of mass @xmath0 trapped in a box of volume @xmath1 . in the s - wave approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath2 is given by    h=_k,_ka^_k , a_k,+_k , k,qa^_k+q , a^_k-q , a_k,a_k , ,    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 annihilates a particle of spin @xmath5 and momentum @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the coupling constant characterizing s - wave interactions between atoms .",
    "this choice of interaction potential is singular and yields unphysical results and to get rid of the divergencies resulting by the zero range of the potential , we introduce an ultraviolet cut - off @xmath8 in momentum space ( or equivalently , we work on a lattice of step @xmath9 ) .",
    "when @xmath8 goes to infinity , the lippmann - schwinger formula obtained by the resolution of the two - body problem yields the following relationship between the bare coupling constant and the scattering length @xmath10    = -_k , [ eqn7 ]    where the sum over @xmath6 is restricted to @xmath11 .    to anticipate the analysis of inhomogeneous systems ,",
    "we work in the grand canonical ensemble , where the atom numbers fluctuate and only their expectation values are kept constant . introducing the chemical potentials",
    "@xmath12 as lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints on atom numbers , we need to find the ground state of the grand potential @xmath13 given by    = h-_n_-_n_.    in what follows , we replace the minimization condition on @xmath14 by a maximization problem on the pressure @xmath15 , using the thermodynamical relation @xmath16 . moreover , we assume @xmath17 and we restrict ourselves to the unitary limit where @xmath18 .",
    "this choice of scattering length leads to a deep simplification of the formalism , due to the universality characterizing this regime .",

    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 is therefore function of @xmath25 yielding the universal relation    = g ( ) ,    where @xmath26 although the general minimization of the grand potential is an extremely challenging and still open problem , we first note that two exact eigenstates of the system can be found .    1 .",

    "the experimental results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that the two classes of states we have until now restricted ourselves are not sufficient to fully capture the physics of imbalanced systems .",

    "theoretically , the existence of the intermediate phase can be demonstrated by the study of the n+1 body problem , in other word the study of the ground state of the majority fermi sea in the presence of a single minority atom .",

    "this means that most of the sums on @xmath6 diverge for @xmath65 .",
    "this singular behavior is regularized by the renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath66 using the lippman - schwinger formula .",

    "we make use of the local density approximation ( lda ) , in which we assume that the chemical potential of species @xmath5 varies as    _ ( r)=_^0-v(r ) ,    where @xmath1 is the trapping potential . from this relation",
