    "<S> such a gap opening occurs in the calculations , separating the acoustic branch from a higher energy optical branch . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , both models predict two well - separated modes at the zone centers @xmath72 = ( 1,1,1 ) , ( 2,2,0 ) and ( 0,0,2 ) at about 0.45 and 0.5 mev , whereas a single one is observed in experiment ( middle column of the @xmath71=0 panel in fig . </S>",

    "<S> more elaborate models are probably necessary to explain these features , taking into account the long - range part of the dipolar interaction or more complex coupling terms than bilinear ones .    reference @xmath11@xmath12 $ ] reports the evolution of the gap as a function of temperature , and ascertains that it varies as the square of the @xmath7 order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the gap calculated in the framework of model a shows instead a linear evolution with the order parameter ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - tof](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the linear and squared order variations is most pronounced in a narrow temperature range spanning @xmath73 to @xmath74 . </S>",

    "<S> to conclude , the present study shows that the molecular field induced admixture between cef levels generates an effective magnetic anisotropy as a plausible mechanism for an energetic selection of the @xmath7 state . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed model captures a number of key features of the inelastic neutron scattering data , including the opening of a spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> its order of magnitude shows that the proposed mechanism appears as efficient as the obd scenario , questioning the completeness of the projected pseudospin @xmath64 model @xcite as a minimal model of er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our study raises the question whether cooperating quantum @xcite and thermal @xcite order by disorder is the sole or even the principal mechanism for the selection of @xmath7 in this material , and whether its advocacy as a rare example of obd @xcite will stand the test of time . on a more positive note </S>",
    "<S> , it seems plausible that quantum fluctuations _ and _ anisotropy induced by cef admixing cooperate to select @xmath7 in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , one might ask whether their _ competition _ might be responsible in part for some of the perplexing properties of er@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite .    </S>",
