    "+ concerning uncertainty in the position of the fntd surface @xmath74 , the error term @xmath100 in ( [ eq : z_act ] ) , which affects the actual focal position @xmath71 is independent of @xmath73 and does not influence the lra and thus trajectory of the incident ions ( parameterized by @xmath13 and @xmath18 ) . the resulting error @xmath75 ( [ eq : x_hat ] ) of the position of the ion track in the horizontal direction is governed by @xmath13 and the product @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 at @xmath27 yields @xmath102 @xmath45 .",
    "for shallow irradiation angles , i.e. @xmath103 , @xmath75 decreases steeply as long as @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath75 becomes yet more relevant if the ion traversal in the intracellular space has to be localized .",
    "it is possible to perform accurate ion track reconstruction in 3d and extrapolate an ion s trajectory into a cell layer covering the fntd by using depth information provided by detector read - out .",
    "the accuracy of the track reconstruction procedure strongly depends on the irradiation angle @xmath13 and by the approach used to identify individual track spot centers . the use of intensity - weighted centroids and dynamic thresholding yield the highest accuracy .",
    "steep irradiation angles distort the otherwise symmetrical track spots , resulting in reduced accuracy of centroid prediction . to achieve the desired accuracy in determining the angle @xmath13 with an error smaller than 1@xmath1 under angular irradiation at @xmath22 the intensity - weighted centroid detection and a 21 image stack separated by @xmath105 @xmath8 m was found as the best set of image acquisition and processing parameters .",
    "increasing @xmath34 to 6 @xmath8 m ( i.e. half the number of track spots ) deteriorates the accuracy , i.e. @xmath57 and pi , roughly by 30@xmath2 and 20@xmath2 respectively .",
    "concerning angles of irradiation with @xmath13 close to 0@xmath1 and using the same fit parameters , @xmath57 decreases by a factor of at least 10 with nearly symmetrical lateral error distribution .",
    "+ the required increase in accuracy of track reconstruction also increases the total read - out time of the detector . to further improve accuracy if necessary",
    "one could extend the total axial range of the image stack , to increase the number of images and decrease the image depth increment between two consecutive image planes ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this , however , is more time consuming .",
    "naturally the total microscope time is directly affected by the acquisition time of a single image plane ( mainly governed by laser power @xmath106 , dwell time @xmath31 , number of rescans @xmath32 and total number of spots per imaging field @xcite ) influencing the signal - to - noise ratio and thus the quality of the detection of the track spot center .",
    "+ the ability of fntd technology to provide accurate 3d ion track reconstruction makes it a powerful tool for radiobiological investigations in clinical ion beams , either being used as a substrate to be coated with living tissue ( cell - fluorescent ion track hybrid detector ) @xcite or being implanted in vivo .",
