    "from old times the wave motion of the ocean bewitched and extremely attracted the attention of mankind .",
    "up to now the problem of understanding specific features of water waves and their modelling represent a real challenge both from scientific and engineering points of view .",
    "occurrence of extremely large and steep ocean breaking waves imposes a hazard to fishing boats , ships , and off - shore oil facilities . to understand physical mechanisms that give rise to extreme breaking waves and to model them",
    "correctly it is necessary to gain detailed knowledge of the form and dynamics of steep water waves .",
    "the canonical problem about the propagation of surface waves on deep water ( see section [ sec : model ] ) was the first essentially non - linear problem in hydrodynamics .",
    "its analysis during almost two hundred years gave the origin to many fields of non - linear dynamics such as solitary waves , modulation instabilities , strange attractors , etc .",
    "@xcite was the first who considered surface waves of finite amplitude ( stokes waves ) .",
    "@xcite conjectured that such waves must have a maximal amplitude ( the limiting wave ) and showed the flow in this wave to be singular at the crest forming a @xmath4 corner ( the stokes corner flow ) .",
    "much later , @xcite suggested that this singularity , for a wave that has not attained the limiting form , is located above the wave crest and forms a stagnation point with streamlines meeting at right angles .",
    "@xcite proved this numerically after extending stokes flows analytically outside the domain filled by fluid .",
    "the following question resulted : why the flow in the limiting stokes wave has the @xmath4 singularity instead of the @xmath5 one , as in any wave with lesser amplitude ?",
    "because of this @xcite conjectured that a continuous approach to the limiting amplitude is possible only if the stokes corner flow has several coalescing singularities .",
    "however , it has not yet clear where these multiple singularities arise from .    a new era in developing the theory of steep gravity waves started from the work of @xcite , where he found that many characteristics of gravity waves , such as speed , energy , and momentum , are not monotonic functions of the wave amplitude , as was assumed from stokes , but attain total maxima and then drop before the limiting wave is reached .",
    "@xcite constructed asymptotic expansions for waves close to the @xmath4-cusped wave ( almost highest waves ) and showed that these dependences oscillate infinitely as the limiting wave is approached . nevertheless , strict numerical verification of such oscillations seems to be a real challenge up to the present time , with only the first relative maximum and minimum having been thoroughly investigated ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that gravity waves steeper than the wave with maximal total energy become unstable with respect to two - dimensional disturbances having the same period as an undisturbed wave ( superharmonic instability ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the form of such instabilities and showed that they lead to wave overturning and breaking .",
    "the conjecture was made that wave breaking is a purely local phenomenon around the wave crest which , in the case of spilling breakers and more gently plunging breakers , occurs independently of the flow in the rest of a wave .",
    "proceeding with this idea @xcite and @xcite suggested that superharmonic instability results in the crests of almost highest stokes waves to be unstable ( crest instability ) .",
    "@xcite strongly supported the conclusion that superharmonic instabilities of stokes waves are indeed crest instabilities .",
    "finally , @xcite showed that crest instabilities lead ( i ) to wave overturning and breaking or ( ii ) to a smooth transition of a wave to a lower progressive wave having nearly the same total energy , followed by a return to a wave of almost the initial wave height .",
    "the latter fact generated a new question : what is the nature of such a transient phenomenon ?",
    "a possible explanation would be found if superharmonic instability resulted in a bifurcation to a new solution , as usually takes place in non - linear dynamics .",
    "however , up to this time it was assumed that the stokes solution is unique and free of bifurcations in keeping with the uniqueness argument of @xcite .",
    "the only bifurcation known to occur is the trivial one of a pure phase shift at the point of energy maximum @xcite .",
    "the above results are all related to stokes waves , for which the speed of fluid particles at the wave crests is smaller than the wave phase speed , equality being achieved for the limiting wave only .",
    "thus , the traditional criterion for wave breaking is that horizontal water velocities in the crest must exceed the speed of the crest @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently provided evidence ( although numerical and not completely rigorous ) for the existence of a new family of two - dimensional irrotational symmetric periodic gravity waves that satisfy the criterion of breaking .",
    "a stagnation point in the flow field of these waves is inside the flow domain , in contrast to the stokes waves of the same wavelength .",
    "this makes streamlines exhibit discontinuity in the vicinity of the wave crests , with near - surface particles being jetted out from the flow . because of this such waves and flows were called irregular ( in contrast to regular stokes flows ) .",
    "existence of irregular waves made the authors propose the following conjectures ( see * ? ? ? * ) : ( i ) a @xmath4 corner at the crest of the limiting stokes wave seems to be formed by merging the stagnation points of a regular stokes flow and an irregular flow ; ( ii ) irregular flows are apparently the result of developing superharmonic or crest instabilities of regular stokes flows .    to calculate irregular flows",
    "@xcite used truncated fourier expansions for the velocity potential and the elevation of a free surface in the plane of spatial variables ( a physical plane ) .",
    "debiane and kharif ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) confirmed the existence of irregular waves using inverse plane longuet - higgins method @xcite , where the spatial coordinates are represented as fourier series in velocity potential and stream function , the corresponding coefficients being evaluated by solving quadratic relations between them .",
    "finally , @xcite also obtained irregular flows by applying his new renormalized cnoidal wave ( rcw ) approximation .",
    "note , however , that at present these are only numerical and approximate proofs .",
    "ordinary fourier expansions used by @xcite become not efficient enough for approximating irregular waves and even stokes waves close to the limiting one due to slow descending of the fourier coefficients .",
    "thus , a more efficient method is necessary for these tasks . up to now",
    "the most precise and efficient way for calculating the properties of two - dimensional surface waves is tanaka s method of the inverse plane ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the key idea of his method is to map the inverse plane into a unit circle by means of the nekrasov transformation .",
    "then boundary conditions are transformed to an integral equation , which is solved iteratively .",
    "the accuracy of obtained solutions is drastically improved by concentrating a numerical emphasis on the crest region using further transformation of variables . as a result ,",
    "tanaka s method is the only one being capable of evaluating the second maximum of the phase speed and even further higher order extremums . in spite of all the advantages of tanaka s method and his program , where it is implemented , we are interested in improving the methods of the physical plane since they can be applied for calculating 3d waves as well and can be generalized to the case of non - ideal and compressible fluid , in contrast to all the inverse plane methods .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to present a new method in the physical plane for calculating two - dimensional potential steady progressive surface waves on the fluid of infinite depth ( see section [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "the method is based on the fractional fourier approximation for the velocity potential recently introduced by the authors @xcite and the non - linear transformation of the horizontal scale for concentrating a numerical emphasis near the wave crest .",
    "the first term of such a fractional fourier approximation was independently derived by @xcite and was called a renormalized cnoidal wave approximation .    in section [ sec : results ] , fractional fourier approximations are applied for calculating regular and irregular flows . in section [ sec : stokes ] , great numerical advantage of fractional approximations over ordinary fourier approximations is demonstrated when calculating almost highest stokes waves .",
    "although the accuracy of the results is still less than the ones obtained using tanaka s method , proposed fractional fourier approximations have a potential to become almost as effective as the method of tanaka . in section [ sec :",
    "irregular ] , fractional approximations allowed investigating the character of singularity of irregular flows in more detail .",
    "the profiles of irregular waves are shown to reveal the gibbs phenomenon usually taking place when a discontinuous function or a continuous function with discontinuous derivatives are approximated by continuous truncated fourier series .",
    "moreover , even regular stokes waves very close to the stokes corner flow are also demonstrated to exhibit the similar gibbs phenomenon in accordance with the observation of @xcite .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "consider the dynamics of potential two - dimensional periodic waves on the irrotational , inviscid , incompressible fluid with unknown free surface under the influence of gravity .",
    "waves are assumed to propagate without changing their form from left to right along the @xmath6-axis with constant speed @xmath7 relative to the motionless fluid at infinite depth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : water ] ) . gravity waves and related fluid flows are governed by the following set of equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wave phase , @xmath10 is the velocity potential ( the velocity is equal to @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the elevation of the unknown free surface , and @xmath13 is the upward vertical axis such that @xmath14 is the still water level .",
    "herein ( [ eq : lapl ] ) is the laplace equation in the flow domain , ( [ eq : dyn ] ) is the dynamical boundary condition ( the bernoulli equation ) , ( [ eq : kin ] ) is the kinematic boundary condition ( no fluid crosses the surface ) , ( [ eq : inf ] ) is the condition that fluid is motionless at infinite depth .",
    "the dimensionless variables are chosen such that length and time are normalized by the wavenumber @xmath15 and the frequency @xmath16 of a linear wave , respectively , @xmath17 being the acceleration due to gravity . in this case , the dimensionless wavelength @xmath18 .     the laboratory frame of reference.,width=321 ]    once the velocity potential and the wave phase speed are known , particle trajectories ( streamlines )",
    "are found from the following differential equations : @xmath19 in the frame of reference moving together with the wave ( the wave related frame of reference ) . in this frame of reference , each streamline is characterized by a constant value of a stream function @xmath20 .",
    "the velocity potential and the stream function @xmath21 in the laboratory frame of reference are connected by means of the cauchy - riemann conditions : @xmath22 this makes possible introducing the complex potential @xmath23 so that @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the complex conjugate . in terms of the complex function @xmath27 ,",
    "the dynamical and kinematic boundary conditions ( [ eq : dyn ] ) , ( [ eq : kin ] ) are as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bernoulli constant .",
    "it is found by averaging ( [ eq : kinr ] ) : @xmath30 ,  @xmath31 is the stokes flow , @xmath32 is the wave impulse averaged over the period : @xmath33    in addition to the laplace equation and the boundary conditions , an initial condition should be assigned . since the canonical model is energy conservative ,",
    "the wave total energy can be used instead to characterise wave properties . for this purpose , however , the crest - to - trough height @xmath34 or the wave steepness @xmath35 are the more convenient parameters since they monotonously increase starting from linear waves up to the limiting configuration .",
    "thus , using the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lapl ] ) , ( [ eq : dynr ] ) , ( [ eq : kinr ] ) , ( [ eq : inf ] ) of the canonical model the following quantities are to be found as the functions of the wave steepness @xmath36 : the complex function @xmath27 , the elevation @xmath12 of the free surface , and the wave phase speed @xmath7 .",
    "when working in the plane of spatial variables the solutions to the laplace equation ( [ eq : lapl ] ) in the flow domain are usually looked for as the following truncated fourier series    @xmath37    this approach was applied by the authors @xcite for calculating steep gravity waves .",
    "fourier expansions ( [ eq : fourier ] ) , however , become ineffective for steep waves with sharpening crests close to the limiting wave due to slow descending of the fourier coefficients .",
    "because of this we proposed @xcite a more effective set of functions to expand the velocity potential on the basis of the following euler formula ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath38 @xmath39 being the binomial coefficients . by choosing @xmath40 ; @xmath41 the following one - parametric expansion for the velocity potential is obtained after truncating the series : @xmath42 where the normalized coefficients @xmath43 were introduced to overcome infinite exponents at @xmath44 .",
    "approximation ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) shows a formal correspondence with pad - type fractional approximates . because of this we called expansion ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) a  fractional fourier expansion \" .",
    "it is singular in a countable number of isolated points @xmath45 , @xmath46 , their location being determined by a free parameter @xmath1 .",
    "singular points are to be located outside the flow domain for calculating potential waves . at @xmath47 , fractional fourier expansion ( [ eq : r_y0 ] )",
    "reduces to ordinary fourier expansion ( [ eq : fourier ] ) with @xmath48 . due to ( [ eq : euler ] ) expansions ( [ eq : fourier ] ) and ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) are equivalent at @xmath49 and the convergence of ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) follows from the convergence of ( [ eq : fourier ] ) . for finite @xmath50 and @xmath51 , however , a fractional fourier expansion converges much more rapidly than an ordinary fourier expansion .",
    "the reason is that a finite number of terms in ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) always corresponds to an infinite number of terms in ( [ eq : fourier ] ) that is especially important for sharp - crested waves .",
    "expansions ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) , ( [ eq : fourier ] ) , and , in general , any function @xmath52 all satisfy the laplace equation ( [ eq : lapl ] ) exactly .",
    "the latter fact was also used by @xcite ( for finite and infinite depth , respectively ) to introduce a renormalization principle that allows reconstructing the velocity potential in the whole domain once the velocity potential at the bottom ( or any other level ) is known . by applying such renormalization to the first - order periodic solution of kdv equation @xcite obtained the velocity potential being exactly the same to the first term ( @xmath53 ) of expansion ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) , which he called a renormalized cnoidal wave ( rcw ) approximation .",
    "there may be other possibilities to improve ordinary fourier expansion ( [ eq : fourier ] ) besides the proposed fractional expansion ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) .",
    "however , one should additionally assure the convergence of series that makes constructing such generalized expansions much more difficult .",
    "one can see from the expansion of derivatives @xmath54 which follows directly from ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) , that the boundary condition at infinite depth ( [ eq : inf ] ) is also satisfied exactly .",
    "hereafter , only the symmetric waves are considered . in this case , the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 are real ( in general , they are complex numbers for nonsymmetric waves ) . after taking into account expansions ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) and ( [ eq : ry_y0 ] ) the boundary conditions ( [ eq : dynr ] ) , ( [ eq : kinr ] ) at the free surface attain the following form : @xmath57    note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyn_t ] ) and ( [ eq : kin_t ] ) at @xmath58 are equivalent to boundary conditions ( [ eq : dynr ] ) and ( [ eq : kinr ] ) , in the class of @xmath59-periodic functions ( subharmonic waves with multiple periods are not taken into account in expansions ( [ eq : r_y0 ] ) ) .      to solve boundary conditions ( [ eq : dyn_t ] ) and ( [ eq : kin_t ] ) one should assign an appropriate approximation to the unknown elevation @xmath60 of the free surface . in the plain of spatial variables , the fourier series @xmath61 are often used .",
    "taking infinite bounds is not necessary for profiles with rounded enough crests .",
    "however , adequate description of sharp - crested profiles close to the limiting one requires taking into account excessively large number of modes due to extremely slow descending of the fourier coefficients .",
    "this highly restricts practical application of ( [ eq : fourier_eta ] ) .",
    "the following non - linear transformation of the horizontal scale originally suggested by @xcite @xmath62 allows overcoming this difficulty by stretching sharp crests to a more rounded configuration . as a result , the fourier series @xmath63 in the @xmath64-space with stretched crests are much more efficient @xcite .",
    "due to nonlinear transformation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) any finite number @xmath65 of the coefficients @xmath66 at @xmath67 corresponds to infinite number of the coefficients @xmath68 in ordinary fourier series ( @xmath69 ) , the associated relations being presented in appendix [ apex : gamma ] .",
    "thus , the role of the parameter @xmath70 for the series ( [ eq : fourier_eta ] ) in horizontal coordinate @xmath71 is the same to the role of the parameter @xmath1 for the series ( [ eq : fourier ] ) in vertical coordinate @xmath13 .      by means of ( [ eq : fourier_eta_gamma ] )",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq : dyn_t ] ) , ( [ eq : kin_t ] ) at the free surface are reduced to the following system of non - linear algebraic equations @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74 is the kronecker delta .",

    "irregular wave is an approximate stationary and obviously unstable solution to the equations of motion .",
    "although we did not investigate its unsteady evolution , the following results are expected . the particles with velocities greater than the wave speed",
    "will all be jetted out away from the fluid and the crest will break if their is no external influx into the flow domain from the left downward jet . after finishing this non - stationary process",
    "the flow will become regular and of lesser steepness .",
    "this resembles the recurrence phenomenon observed by @xcite when computing unsteady non - linear development of the crest instabilities of almost highest stokes waves resulting in a smooth transition to a periodic wave of lower amplitude .",
    "the appearance of irregular flows may give an explanation to this phenomenon .",
    "irregular flows at fixed truncation numbers @xmath50 and @xmath65 depend on the wave steepness @xmath36 in the following way .",
    "as wave steepness decreases from the limiting value , the stagnation point settles down deeper into the flow domain and the distance between the upward and downward jets increases .",

    "this may explain why irregular waves were not traced from stability analysis of stokes waves .",
    "similar to almost limiting stokes waves , lesser @xmath1 are necessary to improve the precision of fractional fourier approximations and to stabilize the position of the irregular branch .",
    "thus , our main concern is that irregular flow is an approximate solution , whose accuracy is not sufficient enough to make definite conclusions even when using fractional approximations .",
    "the only reasonable assumption is that irregular waves correspond to singular solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : irregular ] that although streamlines of the irregular flow are discontinuous near the wave crest the wave profile @xmath12 remains to be a continuous function everywhere .",

    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : irregular ] that the profile of the irregular flow oscillates while approaching the wave crest , where a prominent peak ( an overshoot ) forms .",

    "the example corresponding to the case ( i ) is given in appendix [ apex : gibbs ] , where truncated fourier series of a function with infinite discontinuity are demonstrated to exhibit typical gibbs oscillations and an overshoot .",
    "for the case ( ii ) , the limiting stokes wave can be used as an example because of the sharp @xmath152 corner at the crest corresponding to a discontinuous first derivative . moreover , even regular stokes waves very close to the stokes corner flow also exhibit gibbs oscillations when being approximated numerically , as was revealed by @xcite from the analysis of nekrasov s integral equation .",

    "[ fig : gibbs_stokes ] for the stokes wave at @xmath153 ( @xmath154 of the limiting steepness @xmath155 ) .",
    "the gibbs phenomenon is distinctly observed even though the exact solution is known to be not sharp - crested .",
    "the possible reason is that it has discontinuous derivatives higher than the first one being continuous .",

    "[ fig : gibbs_stokes ] .",
    "the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the overshoot both become approximately five times as small when using more accurate fractional approximations instead of ordinary fourier approximations . and",
    "the distance @xmath156 between the wave crest and the stagnation point becomes approximately four times as small .",
    "this correlates with decreasing the maximal relative error @xmath157 of the solutions approximately by a factor of six .",
    "the conclusion can be made that the overshoot is likely to shrink into a single point when increasing accuracy further similar to the case of the almost limiting stokes wave .",
    "\\2 ) the overshoot has an almost fixed vertical position in contrast to the example with infinite discontinuity in fig .",
    "[ fig : gibbs ] , where the overshoot moves to infinity as accuracy is improved .",
    "this indicates that if the profiles of irregular flows are indeed discontinuous they seem to exhibit a finite discontinuity .",
    "the wave height @xmath158 quickly stabilizes with increasing accuracy and seems not to tend to the height of the stokes corner flow .",
    "\\3 ) the particle velocity at the crest @xmath159 in the wave related frame of reference decreases but much less rapidly than the relative error @xmath157 of the corresponding solutions .",
    "\\4 ) the minimal slope @xmath160 in the gibbs oscillations of the wave profile decreases , the oscillatory tails approaching the horizontal line .",
    "this may be the indication that the profile has two symmetric finite discontinuities in the vicinity of the wave crest",
    ".    these observations and the data presented do not give the final understanding of irregular flows at @xmath58 .",
    "at present , we can only guess what exact solutions to the equations of motion irregular waves do approximate .",
    "we admit the following two alternatives .",
    "\\(i ) the particle velocity at the crest @xmath159 drops to zero , the overshoot shrinks into a single point , and the stagnation point merges with the wave crest .",
    "_ then _ irregular flows approximate a family of sharp - crested corner flows similar to the stokes corner flow but of lesser steepness .",
    "\\(ii ) the particle velocity at the crest @xmath159 does not tend to zero and the stagnation point remains in the flow domain .",
    "_ then _ irregular flows are indeed discontinuous and their profiles are not single - valued and have two symmetric finite discontinuities in the vicinity of the wave crest .",
    "further investigation is necessary to single out one of these possibilities or probably to come to some other conclusion .",
    "fractional fourier approximations for the velocity potential in combination with non - linear transformation of the horizontal scale , which concentrates a numerical emphasis on the crest region , turned out to be much more efficient than ordinary fourier approximations when computing both steep regular and irregular flows .",
    "nevertheless , further improvement of the numerical algorithm is necessary to achieve the accuracy of tanaka s method when calculating almost limiting stokes waves and to attain the final understanding of irregular flows .",
    "one of the possible ways is to use the following multi - term fractional expansion with several different parameters @xmath161 : @xmath162    although the proposed approach was formulated in the framework of the canonical model for infinite depth , its practical application is much broader . @xcite",
    "successfully employed fractional approximations for computing gravity - capillary waves .",
    "when @xmath1 is located inside the flow domain fractional approximations may be applied for calculating vortex structures and solitary waves .",
    "the latter possibility was realized by @xcite using his renormalized cnoidal wave approximation ( the first term of the fractional fourier approximation ) .",
    "he computed an algebraic solitary wave on deep water and traced how it changes after taking into account surface tension ( it is not known , however , how this algebraic solution depends on picking up higher terms of the fractional expansion ) . in the case of finite depth @xmath163 , the fractional fourier expansion will be as follows : @xmath164 finally , fractional expansions may also be generalized to the case of 3d waves and non - ideal fluid .",
    "fractional approximations allowed us to gain more detailed knowledge about the properties of irregular flows .",
    "irregular waves were proved to correspond to singular solutions of the equations of motion . because of this their existence does not contradict to the uniqueness theorem of @xcite since it deals with regular continuous solutions only .",
    "the following two alternatives for the exact solutions associated with approximate irregular flows were singled out : ( i ) the profile of an exact solution is continuous with sharp corner at the crest ( a discontinuous first derivative ) similar to the limiting stokes wave but is of lesser steepness ; ( ii ) the profile of an exact solution has two symmetric finite discontinuities in the vicinity of the wave crest and is not single - valued .",
    "further analysis , however , should be carried out to make a final conclusion .",
    "one of the possible ways is to investigate how an approximate irregular flow depends on taking into account surface tension and to make a comparison with new limiting forms for gravity - capillary waves recently obtained by @xcite .    to conclude note that the formation of jets from irregular progressive waves resembles the occurence of vertical jets with sharp - pointed tips from standing gravity waves forced beyond the maximum height , as has recently been reported by @xcite",
    "taking into account nonlinear transformation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) the coefficients in fourier series ( [ eq : fourier_eta ] ) and ( [ eq : fourier_eta_gamma ] ) are connected as follows @xmath165 @xmath166 ; @xmath167 being the bessel function of the first kind .",
