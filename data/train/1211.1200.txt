    "pulsating variables are located in a restricted region , so - called cepheid instability strip ( is ) in the hetrzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram .",
    "this region includes @xmath5scuti , rrlyrae , populationi and iicepheids which represent an important testing basis for theories on stellar structure and evolution as well as pulsation mechanisms .",
    "these variables have very different masses , effective temperatures and chemical abundances .",
    "the stars in the is are found not only in a wide range of masses but also found among very young populationi type stars to very old populationii type stars .",
    "these stars in the is reveal many properties of the stellar interiors .    at the beginning of the 20@xmath6 century miss leavitt made a great discovery that there is a relation between the period and absolute magnitude of the cepheid variables in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "three decades later @xcite called attention to the difference in the period - luminosity ( hereafter p - l ) relations of the cepheids in the globular clusters and the classical cepheids .",
    "thus , the cepheids are divided into two groups which are populationi ( usually called typei cepheids ) and populationii cepheids ( or typeii cepheids ) , the formers are about 1.5 mag brighter than the latter for the same pulsation periods . taking into account this difference",
    "@xcite made a revision on the p - l relation for the classical cepheids .",
    "these variables are still used as distance indicators not only for our galaxy but also for nearby spiral and irregular galaxies . while the typei cepheids are young - disk stars associated with spiral arm and thin - disk populations evolved from main - sequence stars with masses from 3 to 15 solar masses , typeii cepheids can be old - disk , thick - disk , or halo stars with masses somewhat smaller than the sun ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "typeii cepheids are divided into three subclasses regarding their pulsation periods : blher stars with a period of @xmath7 7d , wvir stars with 7@xmath7 p @xmath7 20 d and rv tau type variables with p@xmath8 20 d. recently @xcite suggested divisions at 4 and 20 days .",
    "masses and radii for these stars were estimated from their pulsation properties .",
    "bl her stars are common in globular clusters and in the disk of our galaxy .",
    "@xcite showed that four of the 12 field blher stars have [ fe / h ] values less than -1.5 which were identified as halo objects with a mean distance from the galactic plane of 1.8kpc . in contrary , the 8 stars have metallicities near or above solar values .",
    "their mean distance from the galactic plane was about 0.25kpc , indicating characteristic of thick or thin - disk population .",
    "there are some metal - poor variables with periods between 0.5 and 3 or more days lying above the rrlyrae - type stars which may have entirely different origin as compared to the normal typeii cepheids in the globular clusters .",
    "these variables are called as anomalous cepheids ( hereafter acs ) .",
    "they are found in the general field , globular clusters and nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "anomalous cepheids are brighter than the typeii cepheids at fixed color , and hence they follow a different p - l relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) suggested that the acs are extension of the typei cepheids to lower metallicities and masses .",
    "moreover , they predict a mass range for the acs as 1.9@xmath7m / m@xmath9 @xmath73 , which may be a product of a mass about m@xmath7 4 m@xmath9 , experienced the helium flash in the past .",
    "only six typeii cepheids were known to be spectroscopic binaries .",
    "txdel , ixcas , aupeg and stpup are single - lined binaries for which spectroscopic observations and the resultant orbits were published .",
    "due to low orbital inclination no eclipses were detected in these binaries .",
    "recently , two cepheid variables in eclipsing binaries , namely tyc103112621 and nsv10993 , were discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the pulsation periods are nearly identical with an amount of 4.2d , but the orbital periods are about 51 and 40 days .",
    "in the second part of the ogle - iii catalog of variable stars @xcite presented 197 typeii cepheids of which seven are eclipsing variables and 83 acs in the large magellanic cloud . since masses and radii for the stars",
    "were measured directly from the eclipse light curves and radial velocities , a detailed study of these cepheids in the eclipsing binaries would be well worthwhile .    the light variability of tyc103112621 ( asasj182611 + 1212.6 , 2massj18261150 + 1212349 , gsc01031 - 01262 , v=11@xmath10.64 , b - v=0@xmath10.77 ) was discovered by @xcite during the all - sky automated survey ( asas-3 ) .",
    "the variability of this star was also detected independently by @xcite on moscow archive plates in crimea .",
    "they plotted the observations obtained by asas-3 , photographic magnitudes obtained from the plates taken with the 40 cm astrograph in the crimea and the observations obtained by the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs , @xcite ) against the time and noticed a new variable as a cepheid with some peculiarities .",
    "they started observations of tyc103112621 with the 50 cm telescope of the crimean laboratory .",
    "these ccd observations clearly revealed eclipsing nature of the star with a typeii cepheid component in our galaxy .",
    "the pulsation and orbital periods are estimated to be 4.1523 and 51.38d , respectively . @xcite",
    "made vr photometry of cepheid variable star candidates including tyc103112621 in 2005 and 2006 .",
    "they proposed a pulsation period of about 4.1508d and classified it as a typei cepheid .    in this study",
    "we present our multi - color photometric and spectroscopic observations of tyc103112621 .",
    "the main aim of this study is to derive the masses and radii of the components .",
    "thus , mass and radius of a typeii cepheid will be revealed , for the first time , directly from the spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "we will also discuss the pulsation characteristics and its place in our galaxy .",
    "the photometric observations in the wide - band johnson ubvr system were carried out with the 48 cm cassegrain reflecting telescope and 35 cm meadelx200gps telescope at the ege university observatory . in the observations with the 48 cm telescope high - speed three - channel photometer and standard ubvr passbands were used .",
    "thermoelectrically cooled alta u+42 2048x2048 pixel ccd camera including bvr passbands was attached to schmidt cassegrain type meade telescope .",
    "the bvr observations in 2008 were obtained on 63 nights between march2 and november5 . the observations in 2009 were obtained on 17 nights between august3 and october8 .",
    "gsc1031193 and gsc10311445 are taken as the comparison and check stars , respectively .",
    "some basic parameters of the comparison stars taken from the simbad database are listed in table1 .",
    "although the program and comparison stars are very close in the sky , differential atmospheric extinction corrections were applied , especially for the observations obtained with the 48 cm telescope . while all the program stars were observed simultaneously with the 35 cm telescope , each star was observed successively with the 48 cm telescope , i.e. in different times .",
    "the atmospheric extinction coefficients were obtained from observations of the comparison stars on each night . moreover ,",
    "the comparison stars were observed with the standard stars in their vicinity and reduced differential magnitudes , in the sense variable minus comparison , were transformed to the standard system .",
    "the standard stars are chosen from the lists of landolt ( 1983 , 1992 ) .",
    "heliocentric corrections were also applied to the times of the observations .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the u- , b- , v- and r - passband observations versus the pulsation period of the cepheid variable . as it is seen the dominant light variations",
    "are originated from the pulsation .",
    "the below shifted observations correspond to the eclipses .",
    "the standard deviations of each data point are about 0.05 , 0.03 , 0.01 , and 0.01 mag in u , b , v and r passbands , respectively .",
    "the observational data can be obtained from the authors .     +    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is quoted in  1 , typeii cepheids are divided into three subclasses : blher , wvir , and rvtau .",
    "all three classes are characterized by the presence of balmer emission , especially h@xmath11 , during some parts of their pulsation cycle .",
    "evolutionary scheme of these classes is suggested by @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the blher stars are evolving from horizontal branch towards the lower asymptotic giant branch .",
    "however , the wvir variables are on loops to the blue from the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the rvtau stars are moving to the blue in a post - asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "he investigates evolutionary status of typeii cepheids as post - horizontal - branch stars and calls attention to a different structure and evolution of the acs .",
    "he estimates masses of typeii cepheids around 0.6 m@xmath9 with a radius of about 8 r@xmath9 in the post - horizontal - branch phase .",
    "@xcite suggest masses between 0.52 and 0.59 m@xmath9 for the typeii cepheids using their pulsation properties rather than evolutionary tracks .",
    "now there is a consensus that typeii cepheids are fundamental pulsators with masses below 0.8 m@xmath9 .    with a mass of about 1.640 m@xmath9 , luminosity of 760 l@xmath9 and radius of 27 r@xmath9",
    "the pulsating primary component of tyc103112621 can not be a typeii cepheid .",
    "if it were a typei cepheid its mass would be greater than 4 m@xmath9 according to the models given by @xcite for z=0.02 and even for z=0.004",
    ". however the acs are usually accepted to be metal - poor horizontal branch stars with masses above 1.5 m@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite presented 83 acs in the large magellanic cloud and showed that acs are located between typei and typeii cepheids in the p - l diagram .",
    "they are found in every dwarf spheroidal galaxy , and unlike typeii cepheids , are absent in globular clusters , except a few acs in @xmath12 cen .",
    "@xcite propose for their origin that they are young single stars due to recent star formation . in contrary ,",
    "@xcite suggest that they are formed as a consequence of mass transfer in binary systems with the same age of the stellar systems they belong .",
    "@xcite examined evolution and pulsation properties of acs and concluded that models of masses between 1.5 and 2.2 m@xmath9 fit most of the stars .",
    "concerning the origin of acs , as single young stars or old binary systems , they have noted that their results did not support a single interpretation .",
    "the mass , luminosity , kinematic properties and light curves of tyc103112621 fulfil most of the properties of the anomalous cepheids .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite the mode identification of an ac is very complex and can not be based only on their light curves . however , @xcite compared light curves of the acs in the lmc .",
    "they proposed that the acs pulsating in the first overtone have generally smoother light curves than for the fundamental - mode pulsators with rounded maxima and minima .",
    "the shape of the light curve of the pulsating star looks like to those of fundamental - mode pulsators .",
    "if we compare its location on the m@xmath13-@xmath14p plane given by @xcite for the acs in the lmc , whose pulsating periods are shorter than 2.4 d , the pulsating star is located on the extension of fundamental - pulsators , as though its classification as a fundamental - pulsator is supported . in fig.8",
    "we compare position of tyc103112621 on the color - magnitude diagram with other acs taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is located among the brightest acs close to the blue edge , with a luminosity of about 800 times solar .",
    "the binary cepheid stpup with a pulsation period of about 18.47 d , is located very close to the tyc103112621 . in contrary , the binary cepheids txdel with a pulsation period of 6.2d and aupeg with a period of 2.4d , are located at the red - edge of the is , with lower luminosity .",
    "we have obtained multi - color light curves and radial velocities of the eclipsing binary system tyc103112621 of which the luminous component is a cepheid .",
    "the astrophysical parameters of the component stars were obtained directly by analysing the light curves and radial velocities . in earlier studies",
    "the brighter star was classified as a metal - poor typeii cepheids . in contrary , some investigators include it into the classical cepheids .",
    "the mass of the pulsating primary star with an amount of 1.64 m@xmath9 indicates that its structure and evolution are different from those of the rrlyrae and wvir stars .",
    "the galactic velocity components @xmath15 have been determined as -14.5 , 47.7 and -47.2 km s@xmath16 and the distance from the galactic plane as about 970 pc .",
    "all these properties and the asymmetric pulsating light curve lead us to classify the cepheid as an anomalous cepheid . the pulsation period appears to be increasing with an amount of 2.46 ( @xmath00.54 ) min yr@xmath16 , the largest period change observed in the typeii cepheids so far .",
    "this observed increase rate indicates that the star evolves redward in the is with shorter timescales .",
    "the pulsating primary star fills almost 85 per cent of its corresponding roche lobe while the less massive star 61 per cent .",
    "the pulsating component in tyc103112621 is very close to its roche lobe , therefore , mass loss or transfer to its companion has taken place .",
    "both components are supergiant and the separation is only two times the sum of their radii",
    ". the companion should unexpectedly affect both pulsation and evolution of the cepheid .",
    "however , it is not clear how such a close companion can cause any period variation on pulsation by tidal interaction alone .",
    "most of the acs are faint stars and have relatively longer orbital periods , therefore , measurements of the radial velocities acs in binary systems are very difficult .",
    "in addition the velocity variations due to the orbital motion may be affected by the pulsation depending on the inclination of the orbits . in the case of tyc103112621",
    "the orbital inclination is sufficiently large to separate the orbital velocities of both components .",
    "if mass loss or transfer from the pulsating star has taken place , the orbital period of the system would be changed , which can be revealed by the observations to be made in coming years .",
    "this will yield us some clues about the further evolution of the acs in binary systems .",
    "special thanks goes to dr .",
    "s. bilir and f. soydugan for his valuable suggestions and discussion about the kinematic properties of the system .",
    "we thank to tbitak national observatory ( tug ) for a partial support in using rtt150 telescope with project numbers 10artt150 - 483 - 0 , 11artt150 - 123 - 0 and 10ct100 - 101 .",
