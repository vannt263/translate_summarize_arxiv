    "+    the modern progress in physics of elementary particles is based on the discovery of the standard model defined by internal @xmath18 gauge symmetry and external poincar/e symmetry . from the point of view of the vacuum structure",
    "the sm rests on the old level , and the higgs mechanism of the breaking the @xmath1 vacuum to the @xmath19 vacuum does not give any geometrical picture of the primordial vacuum . as the standard model comprises three generations of quarks and leptons , the @xmath18 symmetry can not fix many parameters ( about 25 ) and can not explain a lot of physical problems . the big number of the parameters inside the sm and our non - understanding of many phenomena like families , yukawa interactions , fermion mass spectrum , confinement ,",
    "the nature of neutrino and its mass origin give us a proposal that the symmetry what we saw inside the sm is only a projection of more fundamental bigger symmetry based on the ternary extension of the binary cartan - lie symmtries .",
    "there is also an analogy with the dark matter problem and following this analogy we proposed an existence of some new ternary symmetries in sm .    to understand the ambient geometry of our world with some extra infinite dimensions",
    "one can suggest that our visible world ( universe ) is just a subspace of a space which `` invisible '' part one can call by bulk .",
    "the visibility of such bulk is determined by our understanding of the sm and our possibilities to predict what could happened beyond its . to find an explanation of the small mass of neutrinos in the sea - saw mechanism",
    "it was suggested that in this bulk could exist apart from gravitation fields some sterile particles , like heavy right - handed neutrinos which could interact with light left - handed neutrinos .",
    "the majorana neutrino can travel in the bulk ? ! for this we should introduce a new space time - symmetry which generalizes the usual d - lorentz symmetry .    the existence of the majorana fermion matter in nature can give the further development in the understanding of the lorentz symmetry and matter - antimatter symmetry , the geometrical origin of the gauge symmetries of the standard model , 3-quark - lepton family problems , dark matter and dark energy problems in cosmology .",
    "for example , embedding the majorana neutrino into the higher dimensional space - time we need to find a generalization of relativistic dirac - majorana equation which should not contradict to low energy experiments in which the properties of neutrino are known very well ! there could be the different ways of embedding the large extra - dimensions cycles according some new symmetries , what can give us new phenomena in neutrino physics , such as a possile new so(1,1 ) boost at high energies of neutrino .. the embedding the new symmetries ( ternary, ... )open the window into the extra - dimensional world with @xmath20 , gives us renormalizable theories in the space - time with dim=5,6, .... similarly as poincar/e symmetry with internal gauge symmetries gave the renormalizability of quantum field theories in d=4 .",
    "the @xmath21-dimensional binary lorentz groups can not allow to go into the @xmath22 world , _",
    "i.e. _ to build the renormalizable theories for the large space - time geometry with dimension @xmath22 .. it seems very plausible that using such ternary symmetries will appear a real possibility to overcome the problems with quantization of a membrane theory and what could be a further progress beyond the string / ss theories .",
    "also these new ternary algebras could be related with some new susy approaches .",
    "getting the renormalizable quantum field theories in @xmath23 space - time we could find the point - like limits of the string and membrane theories for some new dimensions @xmath24 .",
    "many interesting and important attempts have been done to solve the problems in extensions of the standard model in terms of cartan - lie algebras , for example : left - right extension , horizontal symmetries , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , grand unified theories , susy and sugra models .    at last in the superstring/@xmath21-branes",
    "approaches it was suggested a way to construct theory of everything .",
    "the theory of superstrings is also based on the binary lie groups , in particular on the d - dimensional lorentz group , and therefore the description of the standard model in the superstrings approach did not bring us to success .",
    "in our opinion , one of the main problems with the superstrings approaches is the inadequate exrternal symmetry at the string scale , @xmath29 , the d - lorentz symmetry must be generalized .",
    "this problem exists also for guts .",
    "so , all modern theories based on the binary lie algebras have a common property since the algebras / symmetries are related with some invariant quadratic forms .    in all these approaches",
    "there were used a wide class of simple classical lie algebras , whose cartan - killing classification contains four infinite series @xmath30,@xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and five exceptional algebras @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37",
    ", @xmath38 @xcite there were used some ways to study such classification .",
    "we can remind some of them , one way is through the theory of numbers and clifford algebras , the second is the geometrical way , and at last , the third is through the theory of cartan matrices and dynkin diagramms ( see @xcite ) .",

[ a2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "now we introduce the plus - step operators :    @xmath89    and on the minus - step operators : @xmath90 we choose the following 3-diagonal operators :    @xmath91    for @xmath87 algebra the positive roots can be chosen as @xmath92 with @xmath93    @xmath94 = \\pm ( \\,1,0)\\ , q_{\\pm { \\vec \\alpha}_1};\\qquad \\qquad [ q _ { { \\vec \\alpha}_1},q_{- { \\vec \\alpha}_1 } ] = 2(1,0)\\cdot \\vec h ; \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\vec h , q_{\\pm { \\vec \\alpha}_2 } ] = \\pm ( -\\frac{1}{2 } , \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\ , q_{\\pm { \\vec \\alpha}_2},\\qquad \\,\\ , [ q _ { { \\vec \\alpha}_2},q_{- { \\vec \\alpha}_2 } ] = 2(-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\cdot \\vec h ; \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\vec h , q_{\\pm { \\vec\\alpha}_3 } ] = \\pm ( \\,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\ , q_{\\pm { \\vec \\alpha}_3},\\qquad \\,\\ , [ e _ { { \\vec \\alpha}_3},e_{- { \\vec \\alpha}_3 } ] = 2(\\,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\cdot \\vec h ; \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath95 .",

    "then for this algebra the positive roots are the following : @xmath101    this basis can be practically used in general case to give the complete list of simple finite dimensional lie algebras    @xmath102    since @xmath103 is the lie algebra of traceless @xmath104 anti - hermitian matrices there being @xmath105 linear independent diagonal matrices .",
    "let @xmath106 , @xmath107 be the choice of the diagonal matrices , and let @xmath108 for @xmath109 , @xmath110 be the remaining the basis elements :    @xmath111    it is easily see that the simple finite - dimensional algebra @xmath112 can be encoded in the @xmath113 cartan matrix @xmath114    with simple roots , @xmath115 , which generally obeys to the following rules :    @xmath116    the rank of @xmath117 is equal to @xmath49 .",

    "the both coxeter labels and numbers coincide . the components @xmath144 , with @xmath145 are just the components of the highest root of cartan - lie algebra .",

    "we already know that the superstring gut s did not bring us an expected success for explanation or understanding as mentioned above many problems of the sm .",
    "the main progress in superstrings ( strings ) was related with understanding that we should go to the extra dimensional geometry with @xmath22 .",
    "also the superstrings turned us again to study the geometrical approach , which has brought in xix century the big progress in physics .",
    "this geometrical objects , calabi - yau spaces with @xmath146 holonomy , appeared in the process of the compactification of the heterotic @xmath147 10-dimensional superstring on @xmath148 space or study the duality between 5 superstring / m / f theories .",
    "mathematics @xcite discovered such objects using the holonomy principle . to get @xmath149 , the main constraint on the low energy physics was to conserve a very important property of the internal symmetry , i.e. , to build a grand unified theory with @xmath150 supersymmetry .",
    "it has been got the very important result that the infinite series of the compact complex @xmath151 spaces with @xmath152 holonomy can be described by algebraic way of the reflexive numbers ( projective weight vectors ) .",
    "this series starts from the torus with complex dimension @xmath153 and @xmath154 spaces with complex dimension @xmath155 , with @xmath156 and @xmath157 holonomy groups , respectively .",
    "we would like to stress that consideration of the extended string theories leads us to a new geometrical objects , with more interesting properties than the well - known symmetric homogeneous spaces using in the scm .",
    "for example , the @xmath158-singularities are responsible for producing cartan - lie ade - series matter using in the sm .",
    "the singularities of @xmath151 spaces with @xmath159 should be responsible with producing of new algebras and symmetries beyond cartan - lie and which can help us to solve the questions of the sm and scm @xcite .",
    "this geometrical direction is related with felix klein , s old ideas in his erlangen program which promotes the very closed link between geometrical objects and symmetries .    as we already said that there are some ways to construct ternary algebras and symmetries .",
    "one of them is linked to the theory of numbers.the fundamental property of the simple kcla classification is the abelian cartan subalgebra and the sircumstance that for each step generator of an algebra you can build the @xmath79-subalgebra . for example , it is well known that binary complex numbers of module @xmath160 are related to abelian @xmath12 group .",
    "the imaginary quaternion units are related to the @xmath161 algebra and the unit quaternions are related to the @xmath13 group . and at last octonions are related to the @xmath14 group .",
    "so , our way is to consider ternary algebras and groups based on the ternary generalization of binary numbers ( real , complex , quaternions , octonions ) ( see @xcite ) .    the second geometrical way is very closed related to the symmetries of some geometrical objects .",
    "for example , it is well known cartan - lie symmetries are closely connected with homogeneous symmetrical spaces . due to the superstring approch physiciens have got a big interet to the calabi - yau geometry .",
    "it was shown that the spaces of dimension @xmath162 , @xmath163-spacesm are closely related to the cartan - lie algebras .",
    "then it was proposed that such spaces of @xmath164 could be related to the new @xmath165-ary algebras and symmetries .",
    "we plan to study this question for @xmath166 case through the berger graphs , which can be found in @xmath167 reflexive newton polyhedra .",
    "we determine the berger graphs based on the aenv - algebraic classification of @xmath151 spaces . actually , the berger graphs are directly determined by reflexive projective weight vectors , which determine the @xmath168-spaces .",
    "the calabi - yau spaces with @xmath152 holonomy can be studied by the algebraic way through the integer lattice where one can construct the newton reflexive polyhedra or the berger graphs .",
    "our conjecture is that the berger graphs can be directly related with the @xmath165-ary algebras . to find such algebras we study the n - ary generalization of the well - known binary norm division algebras , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , which helped to discover the most important `` minimal '' binary simple lie groups , @xmath173 , @xmath157 and @xmath14 .",
    "as the most important example , we consider the case @xmath166 , which gives the ternary generalization of quaternions ( octonions ) , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "the ternary generalization of quaternions is directly related to the new ternary algebra ( group ) which are related to the natural extensions of the binary @xmath87 algebra ( @xmath146 group ) .",
    "our interest in ternary algebras and symmetries started from the study of the geometry based on the holonomy principle , discovered by berger @xcite .",
    "the @xmath151 spaces with @xmath152 holonomy @xcite have a special interest for us .",
    "our conjecture @xcite is that @xmath167 ( @xmath151 ) spaces are related to the ternary ( @xmath165-ary ) symmetries , which are natural generalization of the binary cartan  killing  lie symmetries .",
    "the holonomy group h is one of the main characteristic of an affine connection on a manifold m. the definition of holonomy group is directly connected with parallel transport along the piece - smooth path joining two points @xmath176 and @xmath177 . for a connected n - dimensional manifold m with riemannian metric g and levi - civita connection the parralel transport along using the connection defines the isometry between the scalar products on the tangent spaces @xmath178 and @xmath179 at the points x and y. so for any point @xmath176 one can represent the set of all linear automorphisms of the associated tangent spaces @xmath178 which are induced by parallel translation along x - based loop .",
    "if a connection is locally symmetric then its holonomy group equals to the local isotropy subgroup of the isometry group g. hence , the holonomy group classification of these connections is equivalent to the classification of symmetric spaces which was done completely long ago @xcite the full list of symmetric spaces is given by the theory of lie groups through the homogeneous spaces @xmath180 , where g is a connected group lie acting transitively on m and h is a closed connected lie subgroup of g , what determines the holonomy group of m. symmetric spaces have a transitive group of isometries .",
    "the known examples of symmetric spaces are @xmath17 , spheres @xmath181 , @xmath182 etc .",
    "there is a very interesting fact that riemannian spaces ( m , g ) is locally symmetric if and only if it has constant curvature @xmath183 .    if we consider irreducible ( compact , simply - connected ) riemannian manifolds one can find there classical manifolds , the symmetric spaces , determined by following form @xmath184 , where @xmath39 is a compact lie group and h is the holonomy group itself .",
    "these spaces are completely classified and their geometry is well - known .",
    "but there exists non - symmetric irreducible riemannian manifolds with the following list of holonomy groups h of m.    firstly , in 1955 , berger presented the classification of irreducibly acting matrix lie groups occured as the holonomy of a torsion free affine connection .",
    "the set of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath185 in the complex projective space @xmath186 defined by the vector @xmath187 with @xmath188 defines a convex polyhedron , whose intersection with the integer lattice corresponds to the exponents of the monomials of the equation .",
    "batyrev found the properties of such polyhedra like reflexivity which directly links these polyhedra to the calabi - yau equations .",
    "therefore , instead of studying the complex hypersurfaces directly , firstly , one can study the geometrical properties of such polyhedra ..    one of the main results in the universal calabi - yau algebra ( ucya ) is that the reflexive weight vectors ( rwvs ) @xmath189 of dimension @xmath165 can obtained directly from lower - dimensional rwvs @xmath190 by algebraic constructions of arity @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "one of the important consequences of ucya one can see the lattice structure connected to the berger graphs . in k3 case it was shown that the newton reflexive polyhedra are constructed by pair of plane berger graphs coinciding to the dynkin diagrams of cla algebra . in @xmath167 the four dimensional reflexive polyhedra are constructed from triple of berger graphs which by our opinion could be related to the new algebra , which can be the ternary generalizations of binary clas : @xmath191 ,      \\qquad   & \\rightarrow & \\qquad     a_r^{(1)}(k3 ) ,",

    "intersections , and , correspondingly , all graphs , which are connected with affine algebras .",
    "it was shown in the toric - geometry approach how the dynkin diagrams of affine cartan - lie algebras appear in reflexive k3 polyhedra  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was found in  @xcite , using examples of the lattice structure of reflexive polyhedra for @xmath151 : @xmath192 with elliptic fibres that there is an interesting correspondence between the five basic rwvs ( [ fivevectors ] ) and dynkin diagrams for the five ade types of lie algebras : a , d and e@xmath193 .. for example , these rwvs are constituents of composite rwvs for k3 spaces , and the corresponding k3 polyhedra can be directly constructed out of certain dynkin diagrams , as illustrated in . in each case",
    ", a pair of extended rwvs have an intersection which is a reflexive plane polyhedron , and one vector from each pair gives the left or right part of the three - dimensional reflexive polyhedron , as discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "one can illustrate this correspondence on the example of rwvs , @xmath194=(111)[3],(112)[4],(123)[6]$ ] , for which we show how to build the @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 dynkin diagrams , respecrtively .",
    "let take the vector @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "to construct the dynkin diagram one should start from one common node , @xmath199 , which will give start to n=3 (= dimension of the vector ) line - segments . to get the number of the points - nodes @xmath200 on each line one should divide @xmath201 on @xmath202 , @xmath203 , so @xmath204 ( here we considere the cases when all divisions are integers )",
    "one should take into account , that all lines have one common node @xmath199 .",
    "the numbers of the points equal to @xmath205 .",
    "thus , one can check , that for all these three cases there appear the @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 graphs , respectively .",
    "moreover , one can easily see how to reproduce for all these graphs the coxeter labels and the coxeter number .",
    "firstly , one should prescribe the coxeter label to the comon point @xmath206 .",
    "it equals to @xmath207 .",
    "so in our three cases the maximal coxeter label , prescribing to the common point @xmath206 , is equal @xmath208 respectively .",
    "starting from the coxeter label of the node @xmath206 , one can easily find the coxeter numbers of the rest points in each line .",
    "note that this rule will help us in the cases of higher dimensional @xmath209 with @xmath210 , for which one can easily represent the corresponding polyhedron and graphs without computors .",
    "similarly , the huge set of five - dimensional rwvs @xmath211 in 4242 cy@xmath212 chains of arity 2 can be constructed out of the five rwvs already mentioned plus the 95 four - dimensional k3 rwvs @xmath213 . .",
