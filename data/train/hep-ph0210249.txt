    "the existence of a scalar - isoscalar meson @xmath24 with @xmath25 decay was first proposed by schwinger in 1957 in a field theory of strong interactions@xcite .",
    "first experimental evidence for the existence of @xmath24 meson with a mass near @xmath26 came in early 1960 s from the measurements of forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath25 distribution in @xmath0 production@xcite .",
    "it was expected that the @xmath27 resonance would show up prominently in @xmath28 production where the @xmath26 does not contribute .",
    "however the measurements of this reaction at cern in 1972 found no clear evidence for @xmath27@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in 1973 , pennington and protopopescu used analyticity and unitarity constraints on partial wave amplitudes in @xmath29 scattering ( roy equations ) to show that a narrow @xmath27 resonance can not contribute to @xmath30 scattering@xcite . from these facts it was concluded that @xmath27 does not exist and in 1974 particle data group dropped this state from its listings .    in 1972 ,",
    "van rossum and his spin physics group at saclay reported the first measurements of recoil nucleon polarization in @xmath31 elastic scattering made at cern at 6 gev / c@xcite .",
    "the resulting complete set of observables enabled the first model independent amplitude analysis of a hadronic reaction@xcite .",
    "the results invalidated all regge models with the exception of the barger - phillips @xmath32 model .",
    "the same group later measured at cern the polarization in @xmath33 charge exchange and determined the tensor @xmath34 exchange amplitudes from this data@xcite .",
    "not a single regge model was in agreement with the measured amplitudes .",
    "these cern experiments established that experimental determination of helicity amplitudes in hadron scattering using measurements with spin is crucial for our understanding of hadron dynamics .    in 1978 , lutz and rybicki extended the concept of amplitude analysis to pion production processes .",
    "they showed@xcite that almost complete amplitude analysis of reactions @xmath35 and @xmath36 is possible from measurements in a single experiment on a transversely polarized target .",
    "more recently it was shown@xcite that amplitude analyses of reactions @xmath28 and @xmath37 are also possible from measurements on transversely polarized target .",
    "the work of lutz and rybicki opened a whole new approach to hadron spectroscopy and hadron dynamics by enabling us to study the production of resonances on the level of spin amplitudes rather than spin - averaged cross - sections .",
    "the measured spin amplitudes provide more than information about the resonance parameters .",
    "they also connect the resonances to the dynamics of hadron production .",
    "the behaviour of resonances on the level of spin amplitudes thus reveals new information about the production mechanism itself .",
    "the pion production on polarized targets was measured at cern in @xmath38 at 17.2 gev / c@xcite , in @xmath39 at 5.85 and 11.85 gev / c@xcite and in @xmath40 also at 5.98 and 11.85 gev / c@xcite .",
    "recently measurements of @xmath38 on polarized target at 1.78 gev / c were made at itep@xcite .",
    "pion production in @xmath41 using a polarized proton beam was measured at anl at 6 gev / c@xcite .",
    "the cern measurements of @xmath38 and @xmath39 on polarized targets reopened the question of the existence of @xmath27 scalar meson .",
    "evidence for a narrow @xmath27 was found in amplitude analyses of @xmath38 at 17.2 gev / c at low momentum transfers @xmath42 and in @xmath39 at 5.98 and 11.85 gev / c at larger momentum transfers @xmath43@xcite .",
    "new evidence for @xmath27 comes from the amplitude analysis of the itep data at 1.78 gev / c and @xmath44@xcite .",
    "the best fit in @xcite gives @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev .",
    "these values are in agreement with the itep results which give @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 mev .    for dipion masses below 1000 mev the dipion system is produced in spin states @xmath49 ( @xmath50wave ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52wave ) .",
    "there are two @xmath50wave and six @xmath52wave production amplitudes .",
    "the amplitude analysis is carried out in terms of normalized recoil nucleon transversity amplitudes and determines their moduli and cosines of certain relative phases@xcite .",
    "the two @xmath50wave transversity amplitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of nucleon helicity nonflip amplitude @xmath9 and helicity flip amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath11 exchange @xmath10 and @xmath12 quantum numbers in the @xmath53channel , respectively .",
    "they are of physical interest since the residue of the pion pole in the flip amplitude @xmath11 is related to the partial wave in @xmath29 scattering and the residue of the @xmath10 pole in the nonflip amplitude is related to the partial wave in @xmath54 scattering .",
    "the helicity amplitudes can not be determined from the measured transversity amplitudes since the cern data on polarized targets do not give information about the relative phases between the transversity amplitudes .",
    "experimentally , such information can be obtained only in measurements of recoil nucleon polarization .",
    "the measurements of @xmath38 on unpolarized target at cern@xcite were used in model dependent determinations of @xmath15 phase shifts@xcite .",
    "various analyses of @xmath15 scattering used these cern - munich phase shifts to estimate the mass and the width of the @xmath24 meson with differing results@xcite .",
    "the cern - munich phase shifts were obtained using an enabling assumption that all @xmath10 exchange nonflip amplitudes are zero in pion production .",
    "this assumption was invalidated by the cern measurements of pion production on polarized targets which revealed large and nontrivial @xmath10 exchange amplitudes for any dipion spin@xcite .    in 1997 , kaminski , lesniak and rybicki supplemented the cern data on polarized target by simplifying assumptions about the absolute phases of @xmath52wave amplitudes which enabled them to isolate the helicity flip amplitude @xmath11 and to estimate from it the the @xmath50wave phase shift @xmath55 in @xmath15 scattering@xcite .",
    "they found four solutions for @xmath55 .",
    "the two `` steep '' solutions showed evidence for a narrow @xmath27 state .",
    "however the obtained inelasticity @xmath56 violated unitarity@xcite and contradicted certain 4@xmath12 production data@xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that a narrow @xmath27 is excluded in @xmath15 scattering and thus also in pion production @xmath38 .",
    "remarkably , their `` flat - down '' solution was similar to the old cern - munich phase shift @xmath55 .    in this work we present a new model independent amplitude analysis of the cern data on @xmath38 on polarized target using a monte carlo method .",
    "the analysis extends the range of dipion mass from 600 - 900 mev used in the previous study@xcite to 580 - 1080 mev .",
    "the new results for the unnormalized spin `` up '' amplitude @xmath57 show a narrow resonance structure below 880 mev followed by an enhancement above 900 mev and a dramatic dip @xmath22 1000 mev .",
    "the spin `` down '' amplitude @xmath58 shows a broader structure around 700 mev and a dip at @xmath221000 mev . here",
    "@xmath59 is the integrated cross - section taken from ref.@xcite .    in our next step",
    "we supplement the cern data with an assumption of analyticity of pion production amplitudes in the dipion mass @xmath60 .",
    "the production amplitudes then satisfy generalized fixed s and t dispersion relations in dipion mass@xcite . in our finite mass range the analyticity in dipion mass allows us to write the nucleon transversity amplitudes as a sum of breit - wigner amplitudes for @xmath27 and @xmath6 with complex coefficients and a complex coherent background .",
    "we use this parametrization to perform simultaneous fits to the measured amplitudes @xmath57 and @xmath58 to determine the transversity amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we find two different fits , a and b , with the same @xmath61 and the same resonance parameters for @xmath27 .",
    "the solution average values are @xmath7 mev and @xmath8 mev for both fits .",
    "the fixed @xmath62 and @xmath63 dispersion relations for transversity production amplitudes determine their absolute phase .",
    "we show that the phases of the fitted amplitudes must be the absolute phases of the production amplitudes - up to an overall phase common to all amplitudes .",
    "the cern data supplemented by the analyticity of production amplitudes in dipion mass thus allow a complete determination of the helicity amplitudes from the fitted transversity amplitudes without the measurements of recoil nucleon polarization .",
    "this effect of analyticity to reduce the number of spin measurements required for amplitude determination was first observed in an analysis of @xmath64 charge exchange data . when the data on polarized target for @xmath65 were supplemented by fixed @xmath63 dispersion relations for the nonflip and flip helicity amplitudes , the fitted helicity amplitudes reproduced the measured helicity amplitudes obtained from measurements of recoil nucleon polarization in @xmath64 scattering@xcite .",
    "there are two solutions for the helicity amplitudes corresponding to the sign ambiguity of the @xmath5 contribution to the moduli @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the `` down '' solution the contribution of @xmath5 to the @xmath12 exchange helicity flip amplitude @xmath11 is suppressed .",
    "almost all contribution of @xmath5 to pion production is in the @xmath10 exchange helicity nonflip amplitude @xmath9 . in the `` up ''",
    "solution the situation is reversed with almost all contribution from @xmath5 being in the @xmath12 exchange amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "we show that unitarity in @xmath30 scattering clearly excludes this `` up '' solution .",
    "futhermore , we show that the `` down '' solution - and thus the evidence for the narrow @xmath5 resonance - is in full agreement with unitarity in both @xmath13 and @xmath17 scattering .    we conclude that @xmath5 is suppressed in @xmath13 scattering in agreement with the cern - cracow phase shift analysis@xcite and the analyses of @xmath66 scattering using roy equations@xcite . the suppression of @xmath5 in @xmath13 scattering",
    "however does not imply its absence in pion production processes @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "instead , @xmath5 contributes significantly to pion production due to its strong presence in the @xmath17scattering in the nonflip amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "there are four `` down '' solutions corresponding to the four combinations @xmath67 , @xmath68 of the two solutions for the moduli @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the solution combinations @xmath18 and @xmath19 the narrow @xmath5 manifests itself as a broad resonant structure at 720 mev in the helicity flip @xmath23 mass spectrum and thus also in the @xmath3-wave in @xmath13 .",
    "the metamorphosis of a narrow @xmath5 in the helicity nonflip amplitude @xmath9 into a broad resonant structure in the helicity flip amplitude @xmath11 in these solutions is a new phenomenon with important connections to symmetries of qcd .    in a related paper@xcite",
    "we show that weinberg s mended symmetry@xcite selects solutions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "ellis and lanik derived a relation between the mass @xmath71 and the partial width @xmath72 in an effective field theory with broken scale and chiral symmetry@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we show that ellis lanik relation selects solution @xmath18 and imparts the narrow @xmath5 resonance a dilaton - gluonium interpretation .",
    "the solution @xmath18 gives @xmath73 mev and @xmath74 mev .",
    "we thus refer to the @xmath24 resonance as @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present and discuss the results and reliability of our new amplitude analysis . in section iii",
    "we introduce the analyticity of production amplitudes in dipion mass . in section",
    "iv we use it for the parametrization of unnormalized @xmath3-wave transversity amplitudes in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath6 breit - wigner amplitudes and coherent backgrounds and present the results of simultaneous fits to amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in section",
    "v we use the fitted transversity amplitudes to determine the helicity amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "in section vi we show that the``up '' solution is excluded by the unitarity in @xmath30 scattering while the `` down '' solution is in agreement with unitarity in both @xmath30 and @xmath75 scattering . in section vii",
