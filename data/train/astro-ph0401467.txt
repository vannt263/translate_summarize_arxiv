    "apart from convective phenomena like the granulation most features we observe in the solar atmosphere are due to the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the dynamics of this magnetic field lie at the root of solar activity , giving rise to variable amounts of uv , x - ray and particle radiation that influence not only earth climate , but also our daily lives in a society that depends more and more on technology .",
    "thus , there is a real incentive to understand , and eventually be able to predict , the behavior of the solar magnetic field .",
    "while larger scale magnetic field concentrations like sunspot are more evident , longer lived , and easier to observe , the field on the solar surface seems to be distributed predominantly in small - scale magnetic elements like micropores , network bright points and low contrast internetwork fields @xcite .",
    "because of their small size , characteristically @xmath8 @xcite , at or below the resolution limit of current solar instrumentation , and their rapid time scale of evolution of 10 - 100 sec , near sustainable cadence of multi - wavelength observations , the morphology , thermal structure and dynamics of small - scale flux concentrations is difficult to study . despite a characteristic field strength in the kilo gauss range @xcite , the small sizes of magnetic elements result in low values of the magnetic flux and make the field difficult to observe .",
    "therefore , long integration times are needed to reach the required magnetograph sensitivity if the elements remain unresolved , and this results in smeared images due to the short dynamical time scales of the elements .",
    "fortunately , indirect methods which allow much shorter exposure times exist to examine the structure of magnetic elements , and to follow their evolution . in particular , these methods involve imaging the sun in wideband ( of order 1 nm ) filters centered on molecular band heads towards the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "examples are the band head at 388.3 nm due to b@xmath9x@xmath9  electronic transitions of cn @xcite , and the so - called g band ( originally designated by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) around 430.5 nm due to a@xmath0x@xmath1  transitions of the ch molecule @xcite .    in these molecular wideband images",
    "the magnetic elements appear as subarcsecond sized bright points with contrasts of typically 30% , compared to the average photosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that g - band bright points are cospatial and comorphous with magnetic elements in intergranular lanes to within @xmath10 .",
    "also in strong photospheric lines @xcite and the wings of chromospheric lines like h@xmath11 @xcite , and k @xcite bright points seem to coincide with magnetic field concentrations . however , the cores of these lines are considerably darker than the integrated g - band intensity and require much narrower bandpasses , making imaging in them much less practical . until now measurement of magnetic field strength in molecular bright points has had to rely on cospatial magnetograms in magnetically sensitive atomic lines .",
    "this is an arduous process , which involves careful alignment of images taken at different wavelengths and a relative `` destretching '' of images taken at different times to prevent contamination of the magnetogram signal due to seeing induced image distortions .",
    "in addition , not every magnetic element has an associated bright point or vice versa , at a given time , although both @xcite and @xcite conclude that there is a one - to - one correspondence when the temporal evolution of the magnetic field and bright grains is followed .    an important point in the diagnostic use of bright point imaging for the study of magnetic element dynamics and morphology is the question of why the associated bright points are particularly bright in the molecular band heads .",
    "model calculations of g - band brightness in semi - empirical fluxtube atmospheres provide reasonable values for the bright point contrast @xcite .",
    "flux - tube models are hotter than the quiet sun in the layers producing the observed light .",
    "they are evacuated owing to the presence of a magnetic field , thus allowing us to observe deep and therefore hot photospheric layers . for this very reason , @xcite concluded that g - band contrast in the bright points is enhanced compared to the surrounding photosphere because the opacity in the ch lines is less affected by the higher temperatures present in magnetic elements than the continuum opacity , which is mostly due to h@xmath12 . in the continuum",
    "a rise in temperature leads to a higher formation height of intensity at consequently lower temperatures . on the other hand , in the g band",
    "the formation height remains more or less constant ( because of the increase in h@xmath12 opacity and decrease in ch line opacity through dissociation ) so that the emergent intensity reflects the higher temperatures .",
    "similarly , @xcite emphasized that the evacuation of magnetic elements due to the requirement of pressure balance with the non - magnetic surroundings leads to excess ch dissociation making the g band relatively more transparent , thereby exposing hotter layers below .",
    "this has been clearly illustrated by @xcite by modeling the g - band intensity in a snapshot from a three - dimensional simulation of solar magneto - convection . that the ch concentration is strongly reduced in evacuated flux - tube regions",
    "is logical because the molecular concentration depends quadratically on density _ if _ the molecular dissociation is not controlled by radiation , which seems to be indeed the case as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "such a quadratic dependence on density would explain why ch lines show stronger weakening than atomic lines in the g band @xcite , and cause higher bright - point contrast in the ch and cn band heads than in atomic line cores , because in the solar photosphere atomic ionization is mostly dominated by the radiation field , making the opacity in atomic lines only linearly dependent on the density in the flux concentrations .    in this paper",
    "we propose a technique that hopefully will allow us to shed further light on the relationship between the magnetic field in the bright points and their increased contrast , namely the measurement of the field through analysis of the polarization signal due to the zeeman effect in the ch lines that make up the bulk of the opacity in the g band . over the last few years",
    ", we have witnessed an increasing interest in using molecular line polarization as a tool for magnetic field diagnostics , concerning both the molecular zeeman effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the hanle effect in molecular lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quantum theoretical background for treating the molecular zeeman effect has been mostly in place since 1930 ( see * ? ? ? * for a description and references ) , but was first worked out practically in terms of splitting patterns and intensity of polarization components for hund s case ( a ) transitions of any multiplicity and hund s case ( b ) transitions of doublets by @xcite .",
    "his results were extended by @xcite to general multiplicity in hund s case ( b ) and transitions of intermediate ( a - b ) coupling , i.e. , with partial spin decoupling .",
    "here we assume the upper and lower states of the a@xmath0x@xmath1  transitions of the ch molecule to be in pure hund s case ( b ) , where the electron spin is decoupled from the molecular rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is a good approximation for these states because the of small values of the spin coupling constants in both , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "these authors explicitly show the difference in effective land factor between case ( b ) and the intermediate case ( a - b , their fig .",
    "even for very small rotational quantum numbers the perturbations caused by incomplete spin decoupling are very small , justifying our assumption .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : zeeman ] we briefly review the zeeman effect in ch lines and show the effective land factors of satellite branch transitions , which behave differently than those in the main branch .",
    "we discuss our model calculations in section [ sec : modelcalculations ] , and give conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "radiative transitions in a molecule are susceptible to the zeeman effect in the presence of an external magnetic field and may produce polarized radiation that can be analyzed to infer the properties of the field , much like in the atomic case . if a molecule has a non - zero magnetic moment , the interaction of that moment with the magnetic field will split the molecular energy levels into a pattern that is in general , however , more complex than in the atomic case because of the additional degrees of freedom inherent in molecular structure . in a diatomic molecule both vibration along the internuclear axis and rotation around the center of mass influence level energies , but only rotation affects the molecule s magnetic moment because it alters the way the electronic spin and orbital angular momenta add to the total angular momentum @xmath13 of the molecule , which in turn couples to the magnetic field .",
    "three factors can contribute to the magnetic moment of a diatomic molecule : the orbital and spin angular momenta of the electrons , the rotation of the molecule , and the magnetic moment associated with the nuclear spins .",
    "the first contribution is of the order of a bohr magneton @xmath14 ( in si units ) , while the second and third contributions are smaller by a factor of the order @xmath15 .",
    "since the ch lines we consider in this paper have non - zero orbital and spin angular momenta in both their upper and lower levels , we can safely ignore the contributions of molecular rotation and nuclear spin here .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the total electronic orbital and spin angular momenta in the diatomic molecule , and @xmath18 the component of @xmath16 along the internuclear axis . if @xmath18 is non - zero it is coupled to the electric field along the internuclear axis , and is space quantized with quantum number @xmath19 . in spectroscopic notation",

    ", which are similar to the @xmath24 , @xmath6 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , designations in atomic systems .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath13 is always the resultant of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the angular momentum of rotation @xmath27 , and the total spin of the nuclei .",
    "different simplifying cases can be distinguished depending on how strong the relative coupling between these angular momenta is , as first put forward by hund ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if both spin and orbital angular momenta are strongly coupled to the internuclear axis and only very weakly to the rotation , hund s case ( a ) applies . if on the other hand @xmath17 is only coupled weakly to the internuclear axis , whereas @xmath18",
    "is strongly coupled we have hund s case ( b ) .",
    "this is the case that applies to both the upper and lower level of the ch lines in the g - band region and is discussed further here .",
    "figure [ fig : hunds_b ] shows a vector diagram of the angular momenta in hund s case ( b ) . in this case the orbital angular momentum @xmath18 and rotational angular momentum @xmath27 combine to form @xmath28 , with quantum number @xmath29 @xmath28 in turn combines with spin angular momentum @xmath17 to form @xmath13 , which can have quantum numbers @xmath30 according to the standard addition rule for quantized angular momentum vectors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the time average of @xmath36 is composed of a contribution @xmath38 due to the orbital angular momentum which is coupled to the internuclear axis in hund s case ( b ) , and a contribution @xmath39 due to the spin coupled to the rotation axis . since we are considering field strengths outside the paschen - back regime the precession of @xmath13 around the field can be considered slow compared to that of @xmath28 and @xmath17 about @xmath13 , while in hund s case ( b ) the latter is in turn slower than the nutation of @xmath18 about @xmath28 .",

    "typical circular polarization signals at the wavelengths where ch lines alone dominate the spectrum are 25% for the 0.1 t constant vertical field compared to 20% for the strongest atomic lines in this region .",
    "these predicted values are well within the range of what could be observed with sufficient spatial resolution .",

    "9 of @xcite is about 0.1 higher than the value for pure case ( b ) .",

    "the amount of zeeman induced polarization under more realistic conditions in the solar photosphere we solved the stokes transfer equations in a two - dimensional cross section through a simulation of magneto - convection @xcite . in this simulation",
    "the physical domain extends 12 mm in both horizontal directions with a resolution of 96  km , extends 2.5  mm below the surface , and spans 3  mm vertically .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in the horizontal directions , and transmitting vertical boundary conditions were specified .",
    "radiative contributions to the energy balance were calculated by solving radiative transfer in lte using a four bin opacity distribution function .    for the stokes transfer calculations a two - dimensional cut through a single three - dimensional simulation snapshot was selected .",
    "the upper part of this slice , starting at 300  km below the photosphere , was interpolated onto a finer vertical grid , logarithmically in densities , and linearly in temperature and velocities . through this interpolated cross section",
    "the stokes transfer equations were solved in two - dimensional geometry over a subset of wavelengths centered on 430.4 nm . the snapshot employed for this paper had an average vertical field of 0.003 t.    the emergent stokes @xmath4 and @xmath3 spectra from the slice in the wavelength region around 430.40 nm are shown in figure [ fig : stokes_2d ] .",
    "the polarization signal at wavelengths 430.36 and 430.40 is due to the zeeman effect in ch lines alone .",
    "it is most prominent at positions 1.5 , 3.0 , and 4.5 mm .",
    "all three of these locations are associated with downflows as deduced from the redshifts in the intensity spectrum , and are probably positioned in intergranular lanes . at positions 1.5 and 4.5 mm along the slice the line - of - sight component ( in the vertical direction ) of the field is strongest and results in a circular polarization signal of about 1% of the local continuum intensity .",
    "given the size of these magnetic elements of order 100 km , and if the element is isolated without oposite magnetic polarities within the resolution element , they should produce a polarization signal of order at least @xmath124 even when the ( seeing induced ) telescope resolution is only of order 1 mm ( corresponding to slightly more than @xmath125 ) .",
    "this is within the capabilities of current polarimetric instrumentation .",
    "it is worth noting that the spectral feature at 430.40 does not consistently show a one - lobed profile as it does in the spectrum produced by the one - dimensional hydrostatic model . in particular , at position 1.5 mm the blue lobe is visible as well , altough much weaker than its red counterpart .",
    "the difference with the hydrostatic model most likely derives through an interplay between the magnetic field and velocity gradients in the dynamic case , and the different formation heights of the magnetically sensitive and non - sensitive lines .",
    "this inconsistency would make magnetic field mapping through narrow band imaging in one polarity a less reliable method , but its downside would have to be weighed against the improved spatial resolution this technique promises , including the full benefit it would have from image improving techniques like adaptive optics and post facto image reconstruction .",
    "we have solved the full set of stokes transfer equations in two different models of the solar atmosphere in the wavelength region of the g band around 430 nm .",
    "we include polarization due to the zeeman effect in atomic transitions , and most importantly in the molecular ch lines that are the major contributors to opacity in the g band .",
    "judging from the calculated spectrum through a one - dimensional plane parallel model of the solar atmosphere ( falc ) we find several wavelengths regions at which both the intensity and the polarization signals are dominated by ch lines , without significant contribution from atomic lines .",
    "the amplitude of the calculated polarization signal in these locations , of order 25% in the hydrostatic falc model with 0.1 t constant vertical field and of the order of 1% of the continuum intensity in stokes @xmath3 through the magneto - convection slice , leads us to predict that measurement of field strength in the ch lines that provide small - scale magnetic elements with their characteristic brightness is a realistic prospect .    because of the property of the lines of the strong ch main branch to become less magnetically sensitive with increasing rotational quantum number ( as evidenced by the behavior of their effective land factors as shown by @xcite ) the polarization spectrum of the g band is significantly less crowded than its intensity spectrum",
    "nevertheless , overlap of lines still occurs and none of the isolated ch features shows a regular symmetric @xmath3-profile even in the absence of any flows . in this paper we show that the effective land factors of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 satellite branches go asymptotically @xmath7 with increasing molecular rotation ( figure [ fig : satellite ] ) .",
    "however , these satellite branch transitions are much weaker than their counter parts in the main branches and do not contribute significantly to the polarization signal in the g band .    within the 3 nm wavelength interval we investigated we found one location where several ch lines overlap and dominate the spectrum to produce a single - lobed @xmath3-profile at 430.40 nm .",
    "in particular , the spectrum calculated through the hydrostatic falc model shows this behavior , which prompts us to suggest that measurement of bright - point line - of - sight magnetic field strength could be achieved through narrowband ( of order 20 pm fwhm or 200 m ) imaging in one direction of circular polarization . such a method would have the full benifit of image quality improving techniques like adaptive optics and phase diversity restoration for optimal spatial resolution .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath3 spectrum calculated through the two - dimensional magneto - convection slice shows a very asymmetric two - lobed profile at 430.40 nm in some locations rather than a uniformly single - lobed one .",
    "nonetheless , the benefit of optimal spatial resolution may outweigh the polarimetric accuracy in some cases .",
    "proof that such curious single - lobed @xmath3-profiles indeed exist in the solar spectrum comes from recent observations of sunspots obtained with the zimpol polarimeter attached to the gregory coud telescope of irsol ( locarno ) , which will be discussed in an upcoming paper .",
    "we conclude that the technique of magnetic field measurement through stokes polarimetry of the ch lines finally holds the promise for the development of a method that will allow us to unambiguously determine what the role of the field is in the appearance of g - band bright points . if such measurements are successful we will no longer have to deal with the difficulty of interpreting magnetic field measurements in atomic lines together with g - band intensity measurements introduced by the different formation properties of these species .",
