    "nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) are systems where mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom are coupled and whose characteristic length scales are measured in nanometers . while metal or silicon are common material choices for microelectromechanical devices ( mems ) , carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) may become one of the mainstays in future nems technology  @xcite due to their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties : small mass , extraordinary stiffness , low mechanical dissipation and electrical properties ranging from semiconducting to conducting  @xcite .",
    "combined together , these properties allow for nems devices operating in the high ghz regime .",
    "several cnt - based nems devices have already been demonstrated  @xcite .    in @xcite one specific such carbon - nanotube - based system was considered : a three - terminal nanomechanical relay with a layout similar the one in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "such devices have since been successfully fabricated  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the device was considered mainly operating as a switch and transduction was based on a tunneling current between the tube tip and the drain terminal . in a subsequent publication  @xcite",
    "also the high frequency properties were considered and nonlinear resonant behavior was demonstrated .",
    "nonlinear response to ac - drive is a characteristic feature of many mems devices as well as in nems  @xcite and has recently received much attention  @xcite .",
    "it can typically be modeled by using the duffing equation .",
    "understanding of the parametric dependence on the behavior of this response is essential for any potential technological application . of equal importance for technological applications",
    "is to understand how nems devices act when embedded in an electronic circuit . in this paper",
    "we investigate more carefully the rf - response of the three - terminal cnt resonator in figure  [ fig:1 ] subjected to a harmonic input signal on the gate electrode , going beyond the simple duffing equation .",
    "in contrast to previous publications  @xcite , we base the transduction not on electron tunneling between the tube tip and the drain but on the displacement current generated by the time - varying tube - drain capacitance when the device is connected to lossless transmission lines .",
    "this paper consists of several sections . in section 2",
    "we present the system and derive a lumped dynamical model . then , by means of perturbation theory , we derive in section 3 a set of algebraic equations that can be efficiently used to obtain and classify the frequency response of the device along with expressions for the output power ( @xmath1-parameter ) . in section 4",
    "we consider the regime of linear response solutions and in section 5 we characterize the nonlinear behavior . finally in section 6 we discuss the domain of validity of the perturbative approach by direct comparison with numerical integration and discuss the delivered power arising from a purely capacitive transduction .",
    "the system is depicted in figure  [ fig:1 ] . mounted on a conducting support ( source ) of height",
    "@xmath2 is a nanotube of length @xmath3 with outer diameter @xmath4 and an inner diameter @xmath5 . below the tube two",
    "conducting strips of heights @xmath6 and widths @xmath7 act as gate and drain electrodes .",
    "the motion of the carbon nanotube can be described as a simple elastic beam deflecting in only one direction  @xcite using the action @xmath8",

    "@xmath11 is the effective young modulus@xcite of the beam and @xmath12 the moment of inertia .",
    "the cross - section area is @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the density of the tube .",
    "the external forces acting on the tube , i.e. actuation and transduction , arise from capacitive coupling between the tube and the electrodes .",
    "these forces depend on the instantaneous charge distribution and geometrical configuration of the tube .",
    "this gives rise to an additional part of the action for the tube which can be written @xmath15}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] are the tube - gate and tube - drain capacitances at time @xmath17 and @xmath18 the associated capacitor charges .",
    "stationarity of the action with respect to @xmath9 then provides the equation of motion for the beam @xmath19 ^ 2\\frac{\\delta c_i[u , t]}{\\delta u(x ) } \\label{eq : pde}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the shorthand @xmath20}{\\delta u(x)}=\\int dt ' \\frac{\\delta c_i[u , t]}{\\delta u(x , t')}\\ ] ] to emphasize that the functional derivative only affects the spatial dependence of the capacitance at time @xmath17 and the potential differences @xmath21 between the tube and the gate / drain electrodes .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom are most conveniently treated within the circuit model in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "for finite source - tube resistance @xmath22 we have three relevant degrees of freedom @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . with only one incoming signal on the gate , @xmath26 , these charges obey the equations of motion @xmath27\\label{eq : qde1}\\\\ \\partial_tq_{\\rm d}=\\frac{1}{z_0}\\left[v_{\\rm d}(t)-v_{\\rm d}^0\\right]\\label{eq : qde2}\\\\ \\partial_tq_{\\rm t}=\\frac{1}{r_{\\rm s}}[v_{\\rm s}-v_{\\rm t}(t)]\\label{eq : qde3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have allowed for constant dc - bias offsets on each of the electrodes and assumed the gate and drain connected to lossless transmission lines with a real impedance @xmath0 . for the tube diameters and signal frequencies we consider , the kinetic inductance of the cnt  @xcite is insignificant in relation to other impedances .",
    "the capacitances give us a linear relation ship between voltages @xmath28 and charges @xmath29 , @xmath30 ensuring that we have a closed set of equations for the dynamics consisting of equations  ( [ eq : pde])-([eq : qv3 ] ) .",
    "the full pde in ( [ eq : pde ] ) is not very tractable as it stands .",
    "we will assume that only the lowest lying fundamental vibration mode is excited by the incoming signal .",
    "in this approximation the deformation of the tube can be parameterized by the displacement @xmath31 of the cantilever tip from the static equilibrium position ( for details see appendix a ) @xmath32 ^ 2c_i'(x_{\\rm t } ) .",

    "also , in ( [ eq : lumpad ] ) a factor @xmath35 has been incorporated in a phenomenological way to account for dissipation  @xcite .",
    "although direct numerical integration of the lumped model is a straightforward task it is time consuming due to the multiple time scales involved .",
    "it is instead our aim in this paper to derive a set of algebraic equations which can be used to classify or to quickly determine the response of a given geometric or biasing configuration .",
    "we do this through a perturbative analysis by means of the averaging method  @xcite .",
    "we will thus assume that we have a single incoming signal on the gate electrode @xmath36 and cast the system into a dimensionless form by writing @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ^ 2c_{\\rm g}'(\\xi)+\\frac{\\sigma}{2}[v_{\\rm d}(\\tau)-v_{\\rm t}(\\tau)]^2c_{\\rm d}'(\\xi)\\nonumber\\\\   \\dot{q}_{\\rm g}(\\tau)=\\epsilon^{-1}\\left[2v_+(\\tau)\\cos \\omega\\tau - v_{\\rm g}(\\tau)+v_{\\rm g}^0\\right]\\nonumber\\\\   \\dot{q}_{\\rm d}(\\tau)=\\epsilon^{-1}\\left[v_{\\rm d}(\\tau)-v_{\\rm d}^0\\right]\\nonumber\\\\   \\dot{q}_{\\rm t}(\\tau)=\\epsilon^{-1}\\frac{z_0}{r_{\\rm s}}\\left[v_{\\rm s}-v_{\\rm t}(\\tau)\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have defined @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for @xmath47 we chose @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the gate - tube and drain - tube capacitances when the tube is undeflected .",
    "typically the capacitances in nanoscale devices lie in the attofarad range which implies that for a single device the impedance mismatch is large .",
    "hence , @xmath50 providing a good starting point for perturbation theory .",
    "the linear relationships between charges and voltages imply that we can expand in @xmath51 @xmath52 to zeroth order in @xmath51 we then have @xmath53 inserting these zeroth order solutions into the dynamic equation for the tip motion we find @xmath54 ^ 2c_{\\rm g}'(\\xi)+\\frac{\\sigma}{2}[v_{\\rm d}^0-v_{\\rm s}]^2c_{\\rm d}'(\\xi)\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now make the ansatz of an oscillatory solution with slowly changing parameters , @xmath55,\\ ] ] and assume that the quantities @xmath56 keeping only the lowest order terms @xmath57 here the kernel @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 ^ 2c_{\\rm g}'(x_0+r\\cos[\\omega\\tau+\\phi])\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( v_{\\rm d}^0-v_{\\rm s})^2c_{\\rm d}'(x_0+r\\cos[\\omega\\tau+\\phi]).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided the slow variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not change appreciably during one period we can average over one period to find @xmath62 for generic capacitances we would not expect to be able to do these integrals exactly .",

    "we have then @xmath77 relating the total outgoing rf - power on the drain to the incoming rf - power on the gate . for the given input signal",
    "@xmath78 the average delivered power to the device is @xmath79 and the total power delivered on the output is @xmath80 from the linear relation between charges and voltages we have @xmath81 recalling the perturbation expansion  ( [ eq : pertexp ] ) we get to lowest order in @xmath51 @xmath82 evaluating the integral in the stationary state ( @xmath83 ) one finds @xmath84.\\label{eq : s21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a similar result can be derived for the reflection coefficient @xmath85 .",
    "note that the prefactor of @xmath86 indicates that for mismatched systems ( @xmath87 ) only a very small amount of the incoming power is actually delivered to the device and that most is reflected back ( @xmath88 ) .    in a typical setup",
    "we have @xmath89 .",
    "in this case we have found that the system ( [ eq : p1])-([eq : p3 ] ) can be simplified considerably by omitting all terms related to the parametric driving and double frequency components and it suffices to solve the simplified set of equations @xmath90 solving this simplified system produces results which agree quantitatively with the full system  ( [ eq : p1])-([eq : p3 ] ) for weak driving and qualitatively for all bias ranges .",

    "we now go beyond the linear response regime and consider the full solutions of ( [ eq : p1])-([eq : p3 ] ) . for the general case",

    "we expect to obtain the linear response solution stated above . as driving and amplitude increase",
    "we reach a point where deviations from the parabolic potential become manifest , leading to a hysteresis downward in the frequency plane .",
    "we expect this regime to have a similar frequency response as the duffing oscillator .",
    "this regime is discussed below in subsection _ 5.1_. as one increases the driving further the oscillation amplitude is expected to increase . as it increases above the point where the curvature of the effective potential changes sign there will be a qualitative change in the response .",
    "this change is most markedly seen in the phase response ( see figure  [ fig : phi ] ) as `` gap '' around @xmath118 .",
    "we will discuss this regime in subsection _",
    "5.2_.      for sufficiently small vibrations (",
    "[ eq : p1])-([eq : p3 ] ) can be expanded in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath119 to obtain the frequency response equation @xmath120 ^ 2=4\\left(\\frac{\\sigma c_{\\rm g}^0}{\\alpha_{\\rm g}}\\right)^2v_+^2 v_{\\rm sg}^2\\label{eq : fresp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 and @xmath122 this third order equation is the same as for the duffing equation and is adequate for determining the onset of the hysteretic behavior . in the present case it performs less well to determine the frequency response for intermediate oscillation amplitudes in the hysteretic regime in which case one needs to solve either ( [ eq : p1])-([eq : p3 ] ) or ( [ eq : p21])-([eq : p23 ] ) .",
    "we illustrate this regime in figure  [ fig : r ] where the amplitude of oscillation has been obtained from solving ( [ eq : p1])-([eq : p3 ] ) numerically .",
    "the small inset of the figure illustrates the shape of the phase response across the resonance for this family of curves .",
    "the phase response for a larger set of voltages is shown in figure  [ fig : phi ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : phi ] full lines correspond to stable solutions and dashed lines to unstable solutions .",

    "these solutions can not be described by the frequency response equation ( [ eq : fresp ] ) and are large amplitude solutions .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes and average displacements for these solutions are shown in figure  [ fig : r2 ] .",
    "they are mostly unstable due to the fact that their peak oscillation amplitude exceeds @xmath124 .",
    "note , however , ( see figure  [ fig : phi ] and figure  [ fig : r2 ] ) that perturbation theory predicts that some of these solutions have stable ( @xmath125 v ) regions",
    ". these regions can not be reached by sweeping the frequency down from a higher frequency but appears as a disconnected manifold of stable solutions .      as the driving increases even more the peak amplitude of the oscillator",
    "will eventually reach the point where the curvature of @xmath126 changes from positive to negative .",
    "this is clearly seen in the phase response in figure  [ fig : phi ] as a gap opens up around @xmath118 .",
    "the corresponding large amplitude vibrations in this regime are rendered unstable when the oscillator amplitude reaches the point where it `` rolls over the hill '' ( @xmath127 ) and the system snaps into contact.the oscillation amplitude and average displacement for one such solution @xmath128 v are shown as the full lines in figure  [ fig : anal_num ] .",
    "we have also compared the analytical expressions with direct numerical integration of the differential equations . for small amplitude vibrations , including the primary hysteretic regime we find excellent agreement between numerical simulations and perturbation theory .",
    "deviations from the predictions of perturbation theory are only seen for the large amplitude vibrations in the regime where there is a `` phase gap '' .",
    "an example of such a comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : anal_num ] where we clearly see the good agreement for small amplitude vibrations and the deviations at larger amplitudes . by looking at the detailed motion of the tube tip at large amplitudes",
    "one can see that the approximation by a pure harmonic motion is no longer a good approximation and higher harmonics have to be taken into account .",
    "furthermore , perturbation theory predicts the existence of disconnected manifolds of stable large amplitude orbits that can not be reached by sweeping down in frequency .",
    "we have not been able to detect any such orbits in the numerical simulations .",
    "this may be either due to the solutions being unphysical solutions to the perturbation theory equations or that appropriate initial conditions have not been used in the numerical simulations .",
    "the above only concerned matters related to the averaging method .",
    "another issue is related to the assumption of large impedance mismatch ( smallness of @xmath51 ) .",
    "typical transmission line impedances are of the order @xmath129 @xmath130 . with capacitances in the af range",
    "this means that we have @xmath131 which makes the approximation excellent . on the other hand",
    "this also means that transmitted power is very low .",
    "the obvious way to remedy this is to connect several devices in parallel , coupled to common gate and drain electrodes . for an array of @xmath132 devices coupled this way one finds that @xmath0 should be replaced by an effective transmission line impedance of @xmath133 .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : s21 ] is the @xmath1-parameter for such an effective impedance of @xmath134 calculated using ( [ eq : s21 ] ) for biases corresponding to the three different oscillation regimes .",
    "the arrows denotes the associated jumps in the hysteresis curve .",
    "comparisons with numerical integration show that treating the system to lowest order in @xmath51 as we have done here is a good approximation as long as @xmath135 . as @xmath136 the effect of dissipation in the tube - source contact and power delivered to the gate / drain result in a loaded q - factor exceeding the bare mechanical q - factor leading to a broadening of the resonances .",
    "we have carried out an investigation of the rf - response in a three - terminal carbon nanotube resonator structure . by employing perturbation",
    "theory we have reduced the problem of determining and classifying the frequency response to that of solving a set of algebraic equations .",
    "we have found three distinct oscillatory regimes : linear response , hysteretic and a `` phase gapped '' regime which can lead to large hysteresis loops in the frequency response .",
    "comparisons with direct numerical integration have shown that perturbation theory is qualitatively correct , and quantitatively accurate as long as the amplitude of oscillation is not too large .",
    "the perturbative treatment includes also terms related to parametric driving .",
    "we find no qualitative change in the behavior in the rf - response that arises from incorporating such terms .    this project has been supported by nokia research center ( a. i. ) , swedish foundation for strategic research ( ssf ) ( j. m. k. ) , eu through the nano - rf project fp6 - 2005 - 028158 ( j. m. k. ) .",
    "we are grateful for stimulation discussions with eleanor campbell , anders eriksson , sang - wook lee and jukka wallinheimo .",
    "here we outline the derivation of the lumped model for tube vibrations used in the paper .",
    "we begin by writing the solution to the pde in the form @xmath137 here @xmath138 are the eigenmodes with frequency @xmath139 satisfying the homogeneous equation @xmath140 while the offset @xmath141 satisfies @xmath142 for some function @xmath143 to be determined ( typically this is the non - vanishing part of the time averaged force ) . inserting the solution into the pde for @xmath9 and projecting onto a normal mode @xmath144",

    "we will typically work with a system where the driving only excites resonances of the fundamental mode @xmath147 .",
