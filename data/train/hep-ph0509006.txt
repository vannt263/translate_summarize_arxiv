    "proton decay was suggested 30 years ago as a means to probe physics at very high energy scale , such as  @xcite grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "baryon number violation is also a key ingredient  @xcite to understand the baryon asymmetry of our universe .",
    "experimental search for proton decay has yielded  @xcite only limits so far , albeit very stringent ones , and improvement requires huge underground facilities .",
    "more recently , in an attempt to solve the hierarchy problem  @xcite , a new scenario has been proposed , which assumes the existence of large compactified extra dimensions .",
    "it has been observed that , having no test of gravity below the millimeter scale , the radius of compactification can be much larger than @xmath1 , provided the extra dimensions are accessible only to gravitational interactions .",
    "standard model fields are instead localized on a three - dimensional wall whose inverse thickness @xmath2 can be of order tev . denoting by @xmath3 the volume of the extra space , with @xmath4 number of compact extra dimensions , and by @xmath5 the fundamental scale of gravity , the observed planck mass is given by @xmath6 . by asking that @xmath7 , the fundamental scale @xmath5 could be close to the electroweak scale .    in this new scenario ,",
    "proton stability could be problematic .",
    "it is not possible anymore to request that the gauge bosons which mediate baryon number violating ( bnv ) processes to be super massive  @xcite .",
    "a new mechanism has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where leptons and quarks are localized at two different positions in the extra space .",
    "the four - dimensional effective coupling of the higher dimension operators responsible for proton decay are then suppressed by the small overlap of the quark and lepton wave - functions along the extra dimensions .",
    "it has also been proposed  @xcite that by localizing different generations , and at the same time placing left and right components at different positions along the extra space , one can obtain in a natural way quark mass matrices which reproduce a realistic mass spectrum and the quark mixing matrix . in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that a split fermion scenario , disfavored by constraints on flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by kaluza - klein gauge bosons , is still possible if the three - dimensional wall has inverse thickness @xmath8 tev .",
    "having these scenarios in mind , it is reasonable to ask if bnv processes involving higher generations , or right handed components , could be faster than the processes involving the first generation , which we know to be strongly suppressed .",
    "one can imagine an extra space geography where the second and third generation quarks have big overlap with the leptons while the first generation quarks are still sufficiently far away from the lepton localization position .",
    "it is therefore important to give an estimate of how fast bnv processes involving higher generations could be , and how left or right handed dynamics may affect them . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that one can estimate bnv @xmath0 decay branching ratio by using proton decay constraints . applying the same approach , we estimate bnv processes involving higher generations .",
    "let us write down all possible dimension six operators that violate baryon number , but respect the symmetries of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are color indices , @xmath11 are su(2 ) indices , @xmath12 are family indices , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are totally antisymmetric  @xcite . from eqs .",

    "v we estimate bnv @xmath18 and @xmath19 meson decays .",
    "our conclusions follow .",
    "we start by analyzing bnv processes involving @xmath0 , which are intuitively very intriguing .",
    "the fact that the proton can not decay into @xmath0 but only into @xmath20 implies that bnv decays involving left - handed @xmath0 are highly constrained , but for right - handed @xmath0 , bnv processes could be in principle faster .",
    "however , following marciano  @xcite , by considering processes with virtual @xmath0 , as for example @xmath21 ( fig .  1 ) , one can also strongly constrain @xmath0 decays involving right - handed @xmath0 .",
    "so far the search for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26  @xcite and @xmath27  @xcite decay modes has given only upper limits .",

    "we now turn to bnv processes involving higher generation quarks .",
    "in the previous section we showed how marciano s suggestion of considering virtual @xmath0 in proton decays can be used to constrain @xmath55 and @xmath76 . by analogy",
    "one can then constrain any coupling @xmath77 through nucleon decays , where now the family indices @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 can belong to any generation .    as an example",

    "as we are interested in giving only an order of magnitude estimate , we can use @xmath90 to constrain the @xmath77 s by assuming each time that only one single term dominates .",
    "taking for example the term proportional to @xmath83 as the dominant contribution and considering for simplicity only the effect of @xmath91 , the amplitude can be written as @xmath92 \\ ; [ \\bar{b}^c_rt_r\\bar{t}^c_r \\ell_r ] \\nonumber \\\\ * & & \\ \\ [ \\bar{d}^c{p\\hspace{-3.3mm}\\not\\hspace{1.2mm}}_3(1+\\g_5)t^c ] \\ ; [ \\bar{t}{p\\hspace{-3.3mm}\\not\\hspace{1.2mm}}_4(1-\\g_5)d ] \\ ;    @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 where we have neglected the internal quark momenta @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( all of @xmath98 ) with respect to @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    it is clear from eq .",

    "further suppression comes from four body phase space and the hadronic parameter @xmath103 .",

    "we remind ourselves that the above discussion of fig .  3 is just an example .",
    "what we need to do is to identify the fastest possible process generated by bnv involving higher generation quarks .",
    "it is clear that we need to reduce the powers of @xmath49 or @xmath113 .",
    "we now turn to what we feel is the best process in the next section .",
    "the process @xmath75 in fig .  3 is highly suppressed , because for each tree level virtual @xmath115 emission , there is one power of @xmath49 suppression .",
    "it is clear that a diagram involving @xmath115 emission at loop level will be less suppressed . in fig .",
    "4 we give the two - loop radiative corrections for the process @xmath116 involving @xmath117 ; similar diagrams describe two - loop radiative corrections for the process @xmath118 with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath119 and @xmath120 . the amplitude for the process @xmath116 at tree level is proportional to @xmath121 . when radiative corrections are considered , @xmath121 mixes with all the other couplings including @xmath117 .",
    "knowing that @xmath121 is already constrained from the tree level calculation , we obtain a rough estimate of @xmath117 by just isolating the contribution to the amplitude given by the diagrams of fig .  4 .",
