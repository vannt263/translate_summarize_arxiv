    "recently , majorana s stellar representation ( msr ) has gained revived interest as it offers an intuitive geometrical approach to understanding quantum systems with multiple components by mapping states in the higher dimensional space as points on a bloch sphere @xcite . in general , a quantum state of spin-1/2 systems or equivalently two - level systems can be represented as a point on a unit sphere @xcite , and the evolution of the quantum state corresponds to a particular trajectory on the bloch sphere . by using msr , which represents a quantum pure state of spin - j systems in terms of a symmetrized state of 2j spin-1/2 systems",
    ", one can generalize this geometric approach to large spin systems or multi - level systems . in terms of msr",
    ", the evolution of a spin-@xmath0 state can be intuitively understood by trajectories of @xmath1 points on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) bloch sphere , with these @xmath2 points generally coined as majorana stars ( mss ) .",
    "this approach naturally provides an intuitive way to study high spin systems from geometrical perspectives , which has made the msr a useful tool in many different fields , e.g. , classification of entanglement in symmetric quantum states @xcite , analyzing the spectrum of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite , studying bose condensate with high spins @xcite , and calculating geometrical phases of large - spin systems @xcite .",
    "as much of the search for the application of msr has focused on high - spin systems , it is interesting to apply this approach to study the multi - band topological systems .",
    "it is well known that a topological insulator distinguishes a trivial band insulator by its nontrivial topological energy band , which has different geometrical property from a trivial band @xcite .",
    "for a two - band system , e.g. , the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite , one can map the bloch state into a 2d bloch sphere , and the geometrical meaning of topologically different phases can be unveiled by their distinct trajectories @xcite . as a paradigmatic topological model @xcite , the ssh model supports either topologically trivial or nontrivial phase , characterized by the quantized berry phase @xmath3 or @xmath4 @xcite , which is experimentally measurable as demonstrated in the recent cold atom experiment @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall apply msr to study one - dimensional ( 1d ) topologically nontrivial polymerized systems , which can be viewed as a multi - band generalization of the celebrated dimerized ssh model @xcite and were also proposed to be realizable in optical superlattice systems @xcite .",
    "the application of msr enables us to investigate the geometrical property of muti - band topological systems by mapping the multi - level quantum states to mss on the bloch sphere .",
    "consequently , a filled bloch band forms specific trajectory of mss on the bloch sphere , which exhibits very different geometrical structure for topological or trivial phase .",
    "furthermore , we unveil that the distinct geometrical structures of trajectories for topologically different states are closely related to their parities and determined by the distribution of mss at two high - symmetry momentum points .",
    "our study provides an intuitive way to distinguish topologically different phases of multi - band systems and unveils the intrinsic relation between the band topology and parity from the geometrical point of view , which shall deepen our understanding of their geometrical properties .",
    "we consider a 1d superlattice with period @xmath5 @xmath6 described by the hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and we require the system having inversion symmetry by enforcing @xmath9 for the case with @xmath10 , it reduces to the ssh model @xcite .",
    "models with @xmath11 can be viewed as generalizations of the dimerized ssh model @xcite , and for convenience , we also refer them as polymerized models . as the unit cell consists of @xmath5 sites , the spectrum of the system splits into @xmath5 bands . by taking a fourier transformation @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the hamiltonian in the momentum space",
    "can be written as @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the general case with arbitrary @xmath17 , the system does not have topologically nontrivial properties .",
    "nevertheless , when the system has inversion symmetry , it may support topologically nontrivial phase characterized by the quantized nontrivial berry phase or the emergence of doubly degenerate edge states for the open chain @xcite . for convenience",
    ", we shall focus our study on a concrete case with @xmath18 in the present work , and also show our results can be directly generalized to cases with larger periods , e.g. , the case with @xmath19 .    for the @xmath18 superlattice model or trimerized model with inversion symmetry",
    ", the hopping amplitudes can be parameterized as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is taken as the unit of energy and @xmath22 is set .",
    "the spectrum is split into @xmath23 bands and gap between bands is always open for any nonzero @xmath24 . considering the state with the lowest band being fully filled ,",
    "we find that the state is topologically different for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for the open chain with the length @xmath27",
    ", there appear degenerate edge states at both ends for @xmath28 but none for @xmath29 .",
    "this result suggests that there exists a topological phase transition by varying @xmath24 with the transition point at @xmath30 . for the periodic chain",
    ", the topological phase transition can be characterized by the change of the berry phase of the system , i.e. , the berry phase @xmath31 in the topological phase and @xmath32 in the trivial phase . here the berry phase across the brillouin zone ( bz ) , also known as zak phase @xcite , is defined as @xmath33 with @xmath34 denoting the occupied bloch states .",
    "the existence of topological states in our polymerized models is protected by inversion symmetry @xcite . in the momentum space",
    ", the inversion symmetry means that @xmath35 , where the inversion operator @xmath36 is an anti - diagonal matrix with the the matrix element given by @xmath37 .",
    "the system also has time reversal symmetry , which leads to @xmath38 , here the time reversal operator @xmath39 is just the complex - conjugation operator @xmath40 .",
    "as we shall see in the following context , both the inversion and time reversal symmetries give some restrictions on the msr of bloch states , which plays an important role in determining trajectories of mss of topologically different states .",
    "for a @xmath5-band system , the bloch state can be expressed as @xmath41 . to represent this multi - level state by mss ,",
    "it is convenient to map the state to a spin - j state @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 by taking @xmath46 . according to schwinger boson representation theory @xcite",
    ", the angular momentum operators can be described by creation and annihilation operators of two mode bosons , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the state @xmath51 can be expanded by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is defined by @xmath54 and @xmath55 . with the help of schwinger representation",
    ", the state @xmath34 can be factorized as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the normalization coefficient .",
    "if we denote @xmath58 , then the factorization parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be determined by the roots of the following polynomial equation @xcite @xmath61 from eq.([phi ] ) , it is obvious that @xmath62 can be viewed as the product of @xmath2 spin-@xmath63 states with @xmath64 , and a given @xmath5-band bloch state can be described by @xmath65 mss on the bloch sphere .    considering the time reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry of the inversion - invariant polymerized model , we can directly get the eigenstate @xmath66 fulfilling the following relations : @xmath67 ) , we get @xmath68 .",
    "so if @xmath69 is the solution of eq.([poly ] ) , then @xmath70 must be the solution of @xmath71 in other words , for any star @xmath72 of @xmath73 , there must exist a star @xmath74 satisfied @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "so the whole trajectory of mss for a filled bloch band is symmetric about the meridian of the bloch sphere .",
    "similarly , from eq.([eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "so if @xmath79 is a solution of eq.([poly ] ) , @xmath80 is also a solution .",
    "that is to say , for a fixed momentum k , any star @xmath81 of @xmath82 corresponds to a star @xmath83 of @xmath84 , unless @xmath81 lies on the equator .",

    ", we can prove that @xmath98 as the summation terms of correlations cancel out each other ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "consequently , the berry phase of the occupied bloch band is simplified to the sum of berry phases of mss on the bloch sphere , generated by the evolution of each star .",
    "since the mss either appear in pairs , in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 , or locate in the equator , we can further simplify the expression of berry phase by using @xmath101 .",
    "finally , the berry phase of an occupied bloch band is simplified to @xmath102 which is the sum of integrals of each ms along its projecting trace on the equator .    for the trimerized model parameterized by eq.([trimer ] )",

    "it is obvious that trajectories for topologically different states display distinct geometric structures . here ,",
    "in the topologically trivial phase , the berry phase of each star cancels out .",

    "next we show that different topological structures of trajectories of mss are closely related to properties of mss at @xmath106 and @xmath107 . at these high - symmetry points denoted by @xmath108 , which fulfils @xmath109 up to a reciprocal lattice vector",
    ", we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "these symmetries suggest that the distribution of mss for the high - symmetry state @xmath112 must be mirror - symmetrical about both the meridian and equator .",
