    "the structure of the nucleon plays an essential role in understanding the dynamics of qcd , and experiments have been providing many intriguing and unexpected results for decades . in particular ,",
    "the strangeness content of the nucleon attracts a great deal of interest lately . as the lightest non - valence quark structure",
    ", it is an ideal probe for the virtual sea quarks in the nucleon .",
    "extensive experimental / theoretical studies indicate that the strangeness content varies significantly depending on the quantum number carried by the @xmath3 pair : the scalar density is about @xmath4@xmath5% of that of up , down quarks , the quark spin is @xmath6 to @xmath7% of the nucleon , and the momentum fraction is only a few percent of the nucleon . recently",
    ", intensive experiments have been carried out for the electromagnetic form factors by sample  @xcite , a4  @xcite , happex  @xcite , and g0  @xcite , through parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) .",
    "the global analyses  @xcite have produced , e.g. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath10  @xcite , but substantial errors still exist so that the results are consistent with zero .",
    "making tighter constraints on these form factors from the theoretical side is one of the challenges in qcd calculation .",
    "moreover , such constraints , together with experimental inputs , can lead to more precise determinations of various interesting quantities , such as the axial form factor @xmath11  @xcite , and the electroweak radiative corrections including the nucleon anapole moment , @xmath12  @xcite .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ]    unfortunately , the theoretical status of strangeness form factors remains quite uncertain .",
    "for instance , the values for the magnetic moment @xmath13 from different analyses vary widely : @xmath14 in the dispersion relation ( dr ) with pole ansatz  @xcite , @xmath15 in dr with scattering kaon clouds  @xcite , @xmath16 in the quark model  @xcite , and @xmath17 in the chiral quark - soliton model  @xcite .",
    "the analyses for the electric form factor are similarly ambiguous . under these circumstances ,",
    "the most desirable study is the first - principle calculation in qcd , such as the lattice simulation .",
    "however , the calculation requires the evaluation of the disconnected insertion ( di ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3pt_diag ] ( right ) ) , which is much more difficult compared to the connected insertion ( ci ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3pt_diag ] ( left ) ) calculation , because the straightforward calculation of di requires all - to - all propagators , and is prohibitively expensive .",
    "consequently , there are only few di calculations , where the all - to - all propagators are stochastically estimated .",
    "the first calculation was done in the quenched approximation with wilson fermion  @xcite and gave @xmath18 , and @xmath19 from the updated calculation  @xcite .",
    "another quenched di calculation with wilson fermion  @xcite obtained @xmath20 .",
    "there are also several indirect estimates using quenched  @xcite or unquenched  @xcite lattice data for the ci part , and the experimental magnetic moments ( or electric charge radii ) for octet baryons as inputs under the assumption of isospin symmetry .",
    "these estimates obtained @xmath21  @xcite and @xmath22  @xcite . in this paper , we provide the first full qcd lattice simulation of the direct di calculation with high statistics .",

    "it is quite expensive to achieve a good signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) just by increasing @xmath45 because s / n improves with @xmath55 . in view of this",
    ", we use many nucleon point sources @xmath46 in the evaluation of the 2pt part for each configuration  @xcite .",

    ", we employ @xmath81 , considering that @xmath82 from the vector current conservation . in the practical fit of @xmath83 , however , reliable extraction of the pole mass @xmath84 is impossible because @xmath83 data are almost zero within error .",

    "first , we analyze the ambiguity of @xmath2 dependence in form factors , which is rather unknown for the strangeness .",
    "we also study the monopole form , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and find that the precision of the lattice data can not disentangle the difference of the dipole / monopole behaviors .",
    "the results from the monopole fit are @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) , which are consistent with those from the dipole fit and have relatively larger statistical errors .",
    "second , we study the uncertainties in chiral extrapolation by testing two alternative extrapolations . in the first one , we take into account the nucleon mass dependence on the quark mass , using the lattice nucleon mass . from the physical viewpoint",
    ", this corresponds to measuring the magnetic moment not in units of lattice magneton but physical magneton  @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 from the dipole fit , and @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 from the monopole fit , while @xmath113 can not be fitted because fit dof are not sufficient .",
    "note that results are consistent with previous analyses . in the second alternative ,",
    "we use the linear fit in terms of @xmath114 , observing the results have weak quark mass dependence .",

    "we find again the results are consistent with previous analyses . while a further clarification with physically light quark mass simulation and a check on convergence of hb@xmath88pt  @xcite is desirable , we use the dependence of results on different extrapolations as systematic uncertainties in the chiral extrapolation .",
    "third , we examine the contamination from excited states . because our spectroscopy study indicates that the mass of roper resonance is massive compared to the @xmath123 state on the current lattice  @xcite , the dominant contaminations are ( transition ) form factors associated with @xmath123 . on this point",
    ", we find that such contaminations can be eliminated theoretically , by making the following substitutions : @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio , kin1,fb ] ) , @xmath125 in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : ele1,kin1,fb ] ) and ( [ eq : mag , kin1,fb ] ) have modifications in the kinematical factor , which we do not show explicitly .",
    "it is found that the results from these equations are basically the same as before , so we conclude that the contamination regarding the @xmath123 state is negligible .    as remaining sources of systematic error",
    ", one might worry that the finite volume artifact could be substantial considering that the physical spacial size of the lattice is about @xmath130 .",
    "however , we recall that sachs radii are found to be quite small , @xmath131 , which indicates a small finite volume artifact . for the discretization error , we first examine the error associated with the finite momentum @xmath132 , using the dispersion relation of the nucleon .",
    "we find that the nucleon energy at each @xmath132 on the lattice is consistent with the dispersion relation , and conclude that finite @xmath133 discretization error is negligible . as another discretization error , we note that @xmath134 ( @xmath87 ) is found to have 6 ( 8) % error for the current configurations  @xcite . considering the dependence of @xmath67 on these masses",
    ", we estimate that the discretization errors in our results amount to @xmath135% , and are much smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "of course , more quantitative investigations on these issues are necessary with larger and finer lattices , and such work is in progress .    here , we present our final results . for the magnetic moment , @xmath1 , where the first error is statistical and",
    "the second is systematic from uncertainties of the @xmath2 extrapolation and chiral extrapolation .",
    "we also obtain @xmath136 for dipole mass or @xmath137 for monopole mass , and @xmath138 . these lead to @xmath139 , @xmath140 at @xmath141 , where error is obtained by quadrature from statistical and systematic errors . note that these are consistent with the world averaged data  @xcite , with an order of magnitude smaller error . in fig .",
