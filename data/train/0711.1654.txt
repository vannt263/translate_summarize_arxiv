    "our goals are to investigate @xmath7 whether the inhomogeneous activity of teaching of the players can promote cooperation in pgg , and @xmath8 how the noise level affects the cooperative behavior in the pgg .",

    "that is , a large level of noise evidently inhibits the persistence of cooperation for synchronous updating ; but for asynchronous updating , the cooperative behavior can be inhibited mostly at certain value of @xmath1 , which indicates that the cooperative behavior depends remarkably on the updating rule . in inhomogeneous systems , for synchronous updating [ fig.[fig4](c ) ] , the cooperator density @xmath0 varying with @xmath1 displays three different behaviors : @xmath0 firstly increases with @xmath1 and then decreases monotonously after reaching its maximum value for small value of @xmath50 ; @xmath0 increases monotonously with @xmath1 for moderate value of @xmath41 ; @xmath0 firstly decreases with @xmath1 and then increases monotonously after reaching its minimum value for large value of @xmath49 .",

    "in summary , we have studied the effects of noise on cooperation in spatial public goods games by considering two types of players with different activity of teaching .",
    "it was shown that the introduction of the inhomogeneous activity of teaching the players can remarkably enhance the persistence of cooperation .",
    "the introduction of the inhomogeneous activity of teaching can partially resolve the dilemma of cooperation and may shed new light on the evolution of cooperation in the society . by investigating the effects of noise on the cooperative behavior in detail , we found that the cooperator density @xmath0 varying with the noise level @xmath1 displays several different behaviors , which remarkably depends on the values of @xmath2 , on whether the system is homogeneous or inhomogeneous , and on whether the updating is synchronous or asynchronous .",
    "interestingly , when increasing the level of noise , we observed both peaks and valleys in the concentration of cooperators for the middle level of noise .",
