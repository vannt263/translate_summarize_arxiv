    "let us recall the definition and explain this point briefly .",
    "a poisson structure on a manifold is a poisson structure on its sheaf of real functions .",
    "this means that given two local functions @xmath3 on the manifold we may define @xmath4 on the overlap of their definition domains such that :    * @xmath5 * @xmath6 * @xmath7    the poisson bracket @xmath4 can be given in terms of a poisson tensor @xmath8 by @xmath9 . for a regular poisson structure",

    "conversely , any foliation by symplectic leaves such that for any smooth function the hamiltonians of the restriction of the function to each leaf glue into a smooth vector field induces a unique poisson structure ( the book by i. vaisman @xcite is a good reference to study the geometry of poisson manifolds ) .    therefore our result implies :    the sphere @xmath0 admits a complete regular poisson structure .",
    "* remarks * ( 1 ) notice that @xmath0 does not admit a plane field of dimension @xmath10 , since the grassmanian @xmath11 does not admit a section ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . so that a poisson structure for @xmath0 for which the associated symplectic foliation has @xmath10dimensional leaves can not exist either .",

    "as @xmath13 does not admit a symplectic structure , it can not admit a poisson structure of rank @xmath1 .",
    "there is no structure of rank @xmath10 because , if it were to exist , the orientations of its associated symplectic foliation and that of its transverse foliation would join to give @xmath13 an almost complex structure ( which we know does not exist ) .",

    "the tameness condition plus the foliated version of darboux theorem for regular poisson manifolds ( @xcite theorem 2.1 ) implies that there are local coordinates such that the form @xmath54 can be taken to be independent of @xmath55 and equal to the standard symplectic form of @xmath56 .    we could also have modified @xmath51 and @xmath53 with an isotopy between them , by adding a collar to interpolate between them .",
    "in this situation we also appeal to tameness , becasue the added collar is a smooth foliation ( trivial with respect to the collar coordinates ) .",
