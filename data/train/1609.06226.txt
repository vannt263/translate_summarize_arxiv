    "in a recent paper @xcite , smirnov & smirnov have studied the scattering of two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortex - antivortex pairs and solitons by a single quantum vortex in a homogeneous atomic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "they found that the pair is scattered over large angles radiating sound waves , in agreement with earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "this scattering process is important because it lies at the heart of the dynamics of 2d quantum turbulence , a problem which is currently attracting experimental and theoretical attention @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the turbulent motion of many interacting vortices is based on recognizing the most elementary interactions , such as the interaction of a vortex with another vortex of the same or opposite sign ( resulting respectively in rotational or translation motion of the pair ) .",
    "similary , we would like to recognize the possible elementary interactions between a vortex and a large density perturbation induced by the dynamics of vortices by external means .",
    "it is well - known that a quantum vortex in a bose - einstein condensate is a hole of zero density around which the phase changes by @xmath0 .",
    "the natural question is whether the incoming vortex - antivortex pair would be scattered ( and if so , by which amount ) by a density pertubation alone ( without the circulation around it ) , as density gradients induce a magnus force @xcite which deflects the pair . to answer this question ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of vortex - antivortex pairs travelling towards a fixed target in the form of a density perturbation ( hereafter referred to as an ` impurity ' ) and whose depth and size is similar to the depth and size of a quantum vortex ( but without the circulation ) . here",
    "we report about the significant scattering induced by the impurity , and compare it with the scattering induced by a target in the form of a vortex .    for simplicity",
    "we consider a homogeneous condensate at zero temperature , and aim at identifying the various qualitative scenarios which are possible ( quantitative predictions of vortex trajectories in a harmonically trapped condensate require more specific calculations which depend on the actual physical parameters and geometry , and are outside the scope of this work )",
    ". a better physical understanding of the scattering which imperfections induce on vortices is generally useful ( although in general imperfections may not be as symmetric as we describe them here ) .",
    "our results are also relevant to the manipulation of vortices using optical potentials generated by laser beams @xcite .",
    "our model is the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for a homogeneous condensate at zero temperature .",
    "we use dimensionless variables based on the healing length @xmath1 , the time scale @xmath2 and the number density @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the chemical potential , @xmath5 is the ( 2d ) interaction parameter , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is planck s constant ; the external potential @xmath8 is scaled by @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting dimensionless gpe    @xmath9    is solved in the ( dimensionless ) 2d domain @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the initial condition at @xmath11 , schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is a vortex - antivortex pair , consisting of a left ( clockwise ) vortex and a right ( anticlockwise ) vortex initially placed respectively at positions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we call @xmath16 . the initial distance between the vortices of the pair .",
    "the vortex - antivortex pair travels along the negative @xmath17 direction with impact parameter @xmath18 towards a fixed density perturbation ( or impurity ) held at @xmath19 .",
    "the impurity is represented by the ( dimensionless ) external potential @xmath20 where @xmath21 . with a suitable choice of parameters @xmath22 @xcite , solving the time - independent gpe without the vortex - antivortex pair ,",
    "the density profile of the impurity approximately matches the profile of a singly - charged vortex at @xmath23 , @xmath24 in the homogeneous condensate . to quantify the scattering",
    ", we measure the deflection angle @xmath25 of the antivortex away from its initial trajectory , but in some cases ( for example if the vortex - antivortex pair breaks up ) a different description of the interaction is necessary .",
    "in all calculations we choose initial y - coordinates @xmath26 , sufficiently away from the impurity ; the initial x - coordinates , @xmath12 and @xmath14 , vary from case to case , as we change the impact parameter @xmath7 and the vortex separation @xmath27 .",
    "we have identified three typical scenarios :    1 .   * fly - by scenario * + if the impact parameter @xmath7 is large and negative , the vortex - antivortex pair is too far at the left of the impurity , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , to be affected , and the deflection angle is @xmath28 . if @xmath7 increases ( still keeping @xmath29 ) , the vortex - antivortex pair is scattered to the left with increasing positive deflection angle @xmath25 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a , b ) .",
    "2 .   * trapping scenario * + if @xmath7 is further increased ( still keeping @xmath29 ) , the vortex falls into the region of low density of the impurity , see the red trajectory of fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , becomes trapped and stops , with a strong emission of sound waves , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ; at this point , the isolated antivortex processes around the impurity , see the blue trajectory of fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "clearly in this scenario the deflection angle can not be defined .",
    "* go - around scenario * + a further increase of @xmath7 means that the vortex - antivortex pair is almost aimed at the impurity ; the left ( anticlockwise ) vortex and the right ( clockwise ) vortex overtake the impurity on opposite sides , going around it along opposite directions , before joining again , re - forming the pair , and moving on to infinity .",
    "[ fig2](d ) shows that for slightly negative values of @xmath7 the vortex pair is scattered to the right ( @xmath30 ) ; for @xmath31 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](e ) , the vortex - antivortex pair proceeds almost straight ( @xmath28 ) , vortex and antivortex going around the impurity in opposite directions .",
    "finally , for larger , positive values of @xmath7 , the trajectories of the vortex and the antivortex are the same ( as the impurity does not introduce any preferred orientation ) , @xmath25 being replaced by @xmath32 ( in other words the function @xmath33 is antisymmetric in @xmath7 ) .",
    "we summarize the scenarios which we have revealed by plotting the deflection angle @xmath25 as a function of the impact parameter @xmath7 , see the red line and dots in fig .",
    "[ fig4](top ) .",
    "the shaded areas represent the regions where the deflection angle @xmath25 can not be defined because one vortex becomes trapped .",
    "it is instructive to replace the impurity with a third vortex , choosing positive anticlockwise circulation , initially placed at @xmath19 . in this way we can directly compare the deflections of the vortex pair s trajectory caused by a third vortex to the deflection caused by an impurity with the same density perturbation , isolating the effect of the vortex circulation . unlike the impurity , which is fixed ,",
    "the third vortex is free to move under the velocity field of the vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "the deflection angle @xmath25 caused by the third vortex is shown by the blue line and dots of fig .",
    "[ fig4](top ) .",
    "it is apparent that , for large negative impact parameters , the deflection angle @xmath25 is approximately the same for vortex and impurity , but becomes significantly larger for the vortex at small @xmath7 ; moreover , there is no trapping regime for the vortex .",
    "note also that , for the vortex , the curve @xmath33 is not antisymmetric , as in the case of the impurity : for @xmath29 , the closest interaction is between vortices of the same sign , which makes the vortices to rotate around each other causing a deflection to the left ( @xmath34 ) ; for @xmath35 , the closest interaction is between vortices of the opposite sign , which makes the vortices to travel away together , causing a deflection to the right ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "finally , notice that the effect of the third vortex extends to large positive values of @xmath7 , unlike the impurity .",
    "[ fig4](bottom ) shows what happens if we halve the initial separation of the vortex from the antivortex to @xmath37 . at this short separation ,",
    "the trapping regimes disappears ( the vortex , now rather close to the antivortex , moves at large speed , and the impurity is not strong enough to stop it ) .",
    "the other features of the interaction remain qualitatively the same as for @xmath38 .    increasing the size of the impurity or making it shallower - as for the density profiles shown by the dashed red and blue lines of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] - does not change the scenarios of interaction with the vortex - antivortex pair in a qualitative way . fig .  [",
    "fig6](top left ) and fig .",
    "[ fig6](bottom left ) show the go - around scenario respectively for a larger impurity and for a shallower impurity ( the density at the centre is only @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that phase defects ( ghost vortices ) appear inside the large impurity - compare the top right and bottom right panels of figs .",
    "we have compared trajectories of vortex - antivortex pairs launched either towards a third vortex or toward an impurity in the form of a similar density hole but without the circulation . by varying the impact parameter ,",
    "we have identified three general scenarios ( fly - by , trapping , go - around ) which can occur . in the first scenario , the effect of the impurity if qualitative similar to that of the vortex , in the second and third scenarios it is significantly different .",
    "these scenarios represent the elementary processes which can be recognized within a turbulent system .",
    "they are therefore relevant to experiments in which vortices are manipulated by laser beams and to studies of 2d quantum turbulence , as large density perturbations are often generated by vortex annihilations or by the moving laser beam used to nucleate vortices in the first place .",
    "future work should look at the effects induced by an inhomogeneous density background in harmonically trapped condensates .",
    "other aspects which are worth investigating are thermal and quantum fluctuations , which are not included in our mean field gpe model .",
    "qualitatively , one would expect thermal fluctuations to move the vortex and the antivortex of a pair closer to each other , eventually leading to their annihilation .",
    "this effect would lead to the introduction of a new length / time scale associated with the vortex - antivortex pair s intrinsic decaying dynamics .",
    "qualitatively , however , we would still expect the same regimes to emerge .",
    "quantum fluctuations would lead to an intrinsic jitter motion of each vortex about its mean position , with the target impurity also suffering some fluctuations from the fluctuating density in that region . on the average we would still expect the fly - be and go - around scenarios to persist , but our discussion here may represent a rather idealised case .",
    "in fact it would be interesting to investigate this scenario experimentally .",
    "we choose @xmath40 and impose @xmath41 on the boundaries .",
    "typically we use a @xmath42 grid , corresponding to the ( dimensionless ) spatial discretization @xmath43 .",
    "time - stepping is performed using the 4th - order runge - kutta scheme ; the typical ( dimensionelss ) time step is @xmath44 .",
    "we have checked that during typical evolutions the total energy is conserved within @xmath45 .",
    "the initial vortex configuration is integrated in imaginary time for ( typically ) 3500 time steps ( enforcing the normalization @xmath46 ) in order to achieve the lowest energy state , and then integrated in real time to determine the trajectory of the vortex - antivortex pair .        ; the impact parameter is @xmath7 ( here @xmath29 ) .",
