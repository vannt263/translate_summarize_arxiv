    "reaction - diffusion equations are used extensively for modeling pattern formation observed in natural and social phenomena .",
    "the equations are deduced from the simple idea that concentration changes of a material in a system are caused by reactions between the materials contained in the system and by diffusion of each material .",
    "numerical solutions of the equations show a variety of patterns , and they are used widely in various fields such as chemistry , biology , medical science etc . @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to modeling pattern formation is to use a cellular automaton ( hereafter abbreviated as ca ) @xcite .",
    "cas are mathematical models with discrete time , space and state variables , and are defined by simple time evolution rules .",
    "they are able to reproduce complex patterns , and therefore have a lot of applications .",
    "for example , the lattice gas cas represent very well the various features of fluid dynamics and reaction - diffusion phenomena @xcite . in general , cas have the advantage of being able to simulate phenomena at lower computational cost than when using partial differential equations .",
    "a lot of models for cooperative phenomena of excitable media , derived by using partial differential equations or cellular automata have been proposed .",
    "the so - called `` oregonator '' model @xcite expressed in terms of differential equations can explain the belousov - zhabotinsky(bz ) reaction @xcite known as a typical example of a reaction - diffusion system . on the other hand , some approaches by means of cellular automata for excitable media have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , these early ca models featured update rules based on nearest neighbor connections , and hence , faced several serious shortcomings @xcite .",
    "the most serious of these is the lack of curvature and dispersion effects and unwanted anisotropy of the front motion @xcite . to overcome these problems ,",
    "several automata models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "gerhardt , shuster and tyson introduced bigger neighborhoods to model the curvature effects and make the threshold a linear function to take dispersion into account @xcite .",
    "weimar , tyson and watson improved the models by introducing a mask , i.e. a weighted summation of automaton values over large neighborhoods @xcite , and henze and tyson extended it to three spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "these models recover curvature and dispersion effects well , but the anisotropy of wave propagation is not completely eliminated .    in cellular automata , to recover the isotropy of the time - evolution patterns is in fact a difficult problem .",
    "if the adopted lattice used in the modeling has periodicity , such as a square lattice or a hexagonal lattice , then , due to this periodicity the time - evolution patterns obtained from the model become anisotropic .",
    "in @xcite markus and hess have proposed an isotropic model for excitable media . in their model",
    ", they use a square lattice , but instead of placing each grid point at the center of a unit cell , they assign each grid point to a random location within its unit cell . the isotropy is recovered by taking a large number of neighboring cells within a circular area with radius r. as other ca models for excitable media which seem to recover anisotropy to some extent , one can cite the `` moving average ca '' method by weimar @xcite , the lattice gas method cas by raymond et al .",
    "@xcite or chen @xcite et al . , the isotropic ca model for the growth process of a bacterial colony by using a voronoi lattice @xcite proposed in @xcite . in the previous paper @xcite , tanaka and the authors also considered an isotropic ca model for the bz reaction .",
    "this simple square lattice model adopts a moore neighborhood with radius 1 as for the neighborhood cells and recovers the isotropy by introducing spatial randomness in relation to a threshold controlling the excitation of reaction .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose a new method to construct a ca model corresponding to a reaction - diffusion system .",
    "the method is based on the random walk and on the phase diagram of reaction equations .",
    "we require the method to satisfy the following two conditions : ( i)the time evolution pattern of the ca preserves the isotropy of the reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "( ii)the ca model explicitly contains the control parameters corresponding to the reaction terms and diffusion terms in the reaction - diffusion equation .    in the next section , we explain the general method to construct the ca corresponding to a given reaction - diffusion equation . in section 3 , the method introduced in section 2 is applied to the bz reaction , and the obtained evolution patterns are examined .",
    "a summary or the results is given in section 4 .",
    "in this section , a method to construct the ca corresponding to a given reaction - diffusion equation is introduced .",
    "the idea is very simple : to replace the diffusion term by a random walk process and the reaction terms by time evolution along a discrete vector field obtained from the phase diagram .",
    "first , we explain the reaction - diffusion equation in brief , then we introduce our ca model .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath0 different reactive materials @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 in some spatial region .",
    "let the densities of these materials at position @xmath5 and time @xmath6 be @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 respectively , and put @xmath10@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "the reaction - diffusion equation is given as @xmath16 where @xmath17 i.e. @xmath18 is a @xmath19 diagonal matrix which has the diffusion coefficient @xmath20 for each material as a diagonal element .",
    "the vector @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath3 , @xmath24 expresses the interactions between the materials and @xmath25 is the nabla symbol , in particular @xmath26 in two spatial dimension : @xmath27 .",
    "we now introduce our cellular automaton model for the reaction - diffusion equation ( [ rde ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the equation is defined in two spatial dimensions and that the ca model is defined on a two dimensional square lattice .",
    "generalization to higher dimensional systems and different types of lattices will be straightforward . in the reaction - diffusion equation ( [ rde ] )",
    ", the variable @xmath28 represents the density of reactive material . in our ca model",
    ", we replace the density of material @xmath29 by the number of microscopic particles @xmath30 at the corresponding lattice point @xmath31 at time step @xmath32 .",
    "then the time evolution of our ca model is determined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes a set of concentration variables around ( @xmath35 ) at time step @xmath6 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote discrete vector fields which are obtained by replacing the diffusion and reaction terms of the reaction - diffusion equation respectively with the following processes :    * ( i ) * the diffusion term @xmath38 corresponds to a random walk of particles .",
    "let us consider a random walk of particles defined in the neumann neighborhood @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "one can equally adopt the moor neighborhood or other neighborhoods .",
    "we denote by @xmath45 the stochastic variable which defines the number of particles moving from the @xmath46 site to the @xmath47 site due to the random walk of the particles , by @xmath48 that from from @xmath49 to @xmath46 , and so on .",
    "then @xmath36 equals the difference between the number of outgoing particles and that of the incoming particles due to the random walk at position @xmath46 and time @xmath6 : @xmath50 if we define @xmath51 as the transition probability of particles to one neighboring cell in the random walk , @xmath52 is the probability of particles to stay on site and the expectation of @xmath45 , @xmath48 etc .",
    "are given respectively by @xmath53 , @xmath54 with a diagonal matrix @xmath55 .",
    "we can see that @xmath56 corresponds to the diffusion coefficient @xmath18 of the reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "* ( ii ) * the reaction term @xmath57 is replaced with an appropriate discrete function @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath3 , @xmath61 @xmath14 @xmath62 . in equation ( [ rde ] ) , the reaction term @xmath57 is the vector field that defines the velocity vector @xmath63 .",
    "hence @xmath64 should be so chosen such that the time evolution of @xmath65 is consistent with the typical orbits in the phase diagram of the ordinary differential equation @xmath66    since @xmath37 sometimes returns a negative number , it is practically convenient to use the discrete vector field , @xmath67 .",
    "then our ca model is rewritten as @xmath68 we can obtain the time evolution pattern by successive substitution of @xmath36 and @xmath69 for appropriate initial conditions .",
    "it is well known that the continuous limit of the random walk is equivalent to a diffusion equation , and that in the large scale limit , isotropy of the distribution function of the particles is guaranteed by a random walk .",
    "since the discrete vector field @xmath70 is chosen such that it is essentially equivalent to the vector field @xmath57 in the continuous limit , we expect that the patterns obtained from our ca model become almost isotropic in certain large systems .",
    "it should be noted that our model naturally contains the parameters @xmath71 which correspond to the diffusion coefficients and all other control parameters for reactions , which are necessarily contained in the discrete vector field .",
    "in this section , we apply the method introduced in the previous section to the belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction as a specific example .",
    "first , we briefly explain the bz reaction and oregonator known as a mathematical model for this reaction .",
    "next , we introduce our ca model of the bz reaction .      the bz reaction is known as an oscillating oxidation - reduction reaction which occurs by mixing some chemical compounds ( such as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) . if the bz reaction is spread spatially , then it forms trigger waves , spiral waves or target patterns @xcite .",
    "the bz reaction is often modeled by using partial differential equations . among them , the oregonator , which is a system of simultaneous ordinary differential equations with two variables , is widely considered to be the simplest possible model @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the spatial patterns in the bz reaction is described by the following equation which adds diffusion terms to the oregonator : @xmath76 + d_{u } \\nabla^{2 } u,\\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t } & = u - v + d_{v } \\nabla^{2 } v , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) are , respectively , a threshold which gives the excitation and a parameter which defines the excitability of reaction respectively .",
    "depending on the parameters @xmath80 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , eq .",
    "( [ oregonator ] ) shows two typical states : an excitable state with one stable equilibrium point and an oscillatory state with one unstable equilibrium point .",
    "here we consider only the excitable state ( or excitable media ) .",
    "let @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath82 .",
    "figure [ vf_bz ] shows the phase diagram for the excitable state of the bz reaction .",
    "the null clines that are obtained from @xmath83 are shown by solid lines and a typical orbit for the excitable state is shown by a dashed line .",
    "the intersecting point of @xmath84 and @xmath85 is a stable point if there is no diffusion , however it becomes unstable when the strength of the perturbation ( mainly due to the diffusion effects ) exceeds a certain threshold @xmath86 .",
    "then the state of the medium becomes unstable and changes along the dashed line shown in the phase diagram , until it returns to the equilibrium point once again .",
    "the repetition of this process induces spacial patterns such as spiral waves .          our ca model for eq .",
    "( [ oregonator ] ) is described in the form of eq .",
    "( [ camodel ] ) , introduced in section 2.2 . according to eq .",
    "( [ oregonator ] ) , we put @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "first , we define the discrete vector field @xmath69 by imitating the solution orbit of the phase diagram shown in figure [ vf_bz ] .",
    "the discrete vector field we configured is shown in table [ table1 ] and illustrated in figure [ dvf_bz ] .",
    "we can see that figure [ dvf_bz ] is a simplification of the phase diagram of figure [ vf_bz ] .",
    "let @xmath90 , @xmath91 in this example of an excitable bz reaction .",
    "parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 control the rate of reaction , and @xmath95 is the threshold which determines whether the excitation occurs or not .",
    "parameter @xmath96 denotes the expected maximum value of variable @xmath97 .",
    "all of these five parameters are positive integers .",
    "the value of the discrete vector field @xmath98 is determined in function of the values of @xmath97 and @xmath99 , as shown in table [ table1 ] . for @xmath100 , the state of the medium returns to the equilibrium point with velocity @xmath92 , because the state can not exceed the threshold @xmath95 due to inadequate diffusion effects . for @xmath101 , the variable @xmath97 increases at the rate @xmath93 until @xmath102 . in the range @xmath103 ,",
    "the variable @xmath97 decreases at the rate of @xmath94 . in the two remaining ranges , the variable @xmath99 changes between 0 and 1 .",
    "here we assumed @xmath91 , because two states are sufficient to separate the phases , according to the medium , corresponding to the variable @xmath99 .",

    "( [ oregonator ] ) , the excitation of excitable media is determined by the diffusion of @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath105 .",

    "we observed that from a pulse triggered at the center , a ring - shaped wave spreads outwards in an almost isotropic fashion .    in order to generate a spiral wave ,",
    "appropriate initial conditions are necessary .",
    "firstly , we generate a single trigger wave like the one shown in figure [ ring ] .",
    "then we cut off one part of the ring pattern as shown in figure [ cutring ] and use the remainder as the initial state . the spiral wave obtained from our model",
