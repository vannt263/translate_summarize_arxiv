    "large amounts of interstellar gas can be removed from the main disks of spiral galaxies by four main processes : tides due to the gravitational force of a companion , ram pressure stripping during a near - head - on collision between gas - rich galaxies , ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas , and galactic winds driven by supernovae . by ejecting processed gas into intergalactic space",
    ", these mechanisms contribute to the metal - enrichment of the intergalactic medium . in many cases , which of these four processes is active in a given galaxy system",
    "can be determined from the optical , radio , and/or x - ray morphology .",
    "the signature of a tidal encounter between two galaxies is the presence of long stellar and/or hi tails and bridges ( e.g. , toomre @xmath13 toomre 1972 ) , while head - on collisions between gas - rich galaxies can produce ring galaxies ( e.g. , lynds @xmath13 toomre 1976 ; theys @xmath13 spiegel 1977 ) as well as gaseous bridges between the galaxies ( struck 1997 ) .",
    "ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas leads to an hi deficiency ( e.g. , giovanelli @xmath13 haynes 1983 ) , truncation of the outer hi disk of a galaxy ( cayette et al .",
    "1990 ) , and in some cases , bending of the hi disk ( kenney @xmath13 koopmann 1999 ) , but not usually removal of large quantities of molecular gas ( kenney @xmath13 young 1989 ) .",
    "galactic winds are identified by extended extra - disk ionized gas without stellar counterparts ( e.g. , rand , kulkarni , @xmath13 hester 1990 ) .",
    "star formation sometimes occurs in gas clouds far removed from the main disks of galaxies . of the four processes that can remove gas from disks , the best - known to trigger",
    "the formation of young stars in the stripped gas is tidal forces : numerous examples of luminous h  ii regions in tidal features have been found ( e.g. , schweizer 1978 ; mirabel et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "young stars have also been found in extra - disk gas clouds thought to have been stripped during head - on collisions ( smith et al .",
    "1999 ) and interstellar - intracluster encounters ( xu et al . 1999 ) .    in order to better understand the processes that lead to the removal of gas from galaxies and the triggering of star formation in this gas",
    ", it is important to make a complete inventory of the gas in these features .",
    "this means not just the atomic gas , which has been surveyed in a large number of extragalactic tails and bridges ( e.g. , haynes et al .",
    "1984 ; smith 1991 ; hibbard @xmath13 van gorkom 1996 ) , but also the molecular gas .",
    "molecular gas has proved elusive in classical tidal tails ; in our earlier co survey of six tidal tails ( smith @xmath13 higdon 1994 ) , no co was found to very low levels , while only very low mass concentrations of molecular gas ( @xmath1410@xmath15 m@xmath16 ) were found in the tidal features of the nearby interacting system m81/m82/ngc 3077 ( brouillet , henkel , @xmath13 baudry 1992 ; walter @xmath13 heithausen 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast to tidal features , gas removed from galaxy disks by ram pressure during head - on collisions between two gas - rich galaxies may be richer in co. the proto - type of this class of object is the co - rich gas concentration found outside the disk of the virgo cluster galaxy ngc 4438 by combes et al .",
    "if the standard galactic n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratio holds in this feature , it contains m@xmath8 @xmath10 10@xmath17 m@xmath16 .",
    "the ring - like morphology of ngc 4438 and the proximity of the companion galaxy ngc 4435 suggests that this clump was removed during a head - on collision between the two galaxies ( kenney et al .",
    "another apparent example of gas ram pressure - stripped during a galaxy - galaxy collision is the eastern tail of the peculiar galaxy ngc 2782 .",
    "this feature has strong co emission , corresponding to 6 @xmath1 10@xmath18 m@xmath19 , assuming the galactic n@xmath8/i@xmath9 conversion factor ( smith et al .",
    "1999 ) . based on morphological considerations",
    ", we surmised that this feature was created during a near head - on collision between two galaxies , rather than a grazing encounter ( smith 1994 ) .",
    "these results suggest that features produced in head - on collisions may differ in a fundamental way from classical tidal tails and bridges formed during grazing encounters : they may be richer in co. during a head - on collision , the material pulled out into a tail or bridge may originate in the inner disk of one of the galaxies , and so may be more metal - rich than gas pulled out from the outer disk in a more distant encounter .",
    "the metallicity of the gas may affect the n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratio , and therefore the detectability of the co line . both theoretical ( e.g. , maloney @xmath13 black 1988 ) and observational ( e.g. , wilson 1995 ; verter @xmath13 hodge 1995 ; arimoto , sofue , @xmath13 tsujimoto 1996 ) studies show that low metallicities can lead to enhanced n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratios compared to the galactic value . in gas with low abundances and dust content",
    ", ultraviolet radiation penetrates more deeply into a molecular cloud , causing a larger c@xmath20 region relative to the co core , increasing the n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratio .",
    "the conclusion that tidal gas differs from ram pressure stripped gas is quite uncertain , in part because of the very small sample size .",
    "we have therefore continued our co survey of extragalactic tails and bridges , selecting systems with high hi column densities , strong star formation rates , and/or ring - like morphologies . in this paper",
    ", we present new co data for tails and bridges in nine additional interacting galaxy systems . we compare these data with the previous results discussed above , as well as the new co data discussed in smith ( 2000 ) , braine et al .",

    "the co ( 1 @xmath0 0 ) observations were made using the 3 mm sis receiver on the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 12 m telescope during several observing runs between 1996 and 2000 .",
    "two 256@xmath12 mhz filterbanks , one for each polarization , were used for the observations , providing a total bandpass of 1300 km s@xmath11 with a spectral resolution of 5.2 km s@xmath11 .",
    "a nutating subreflector with an azimuthal beam throw of 3@xmath22 was used , taking care to avoid chopping on other galaxies , tails , or bridges in the system .",

    "the beamsize fwhm is 55@xmath4 at 115 ghz .",
    "the pointing was checked periodically with bright continuum sources and was consistent to 10@xmath4 .",
    "the system temperatures ranged from 200 to 500 k. calibration was accomplished using an ambient chopper wheel .    a total of 45 positions in nine interacting systems were observed .",
    "these nine systems are listed in table 1 , along with a brief description of their optical morphologies . in figure 1 , we display optical images of these systems , obtained from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "table 2 lists the observed positions in the galaxies and tails / bridges ; these positions and the co fwhm beamwidth are marked in figure 1 .",
    "fourteen of the observed positions were in tails or bridges ; the rest were in the main disks of the galaxies .",
    "a total of eleven tails and bridges were observed . in three systems ( arp 144 , ngc 2814/20 , and ngc 3628 ) , we observed multiple positions in a single tail or bridge .",
    "table 2 also lists the central velocities of the observed bandpasses .",
    "note that i zw 192 , ngc 3561b , and position a in stephan s quintet were all observed twice , with two different central velocities , to increase the observed bandpass ; these two sets of data were combined .",
    "the results of the co observations are given in table 3 : the line fluxes , velocities , widths , and rms noise levels .",
    "the summed spectra for each observed position are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "note that the center of ngc 7828 and one of the tail positions in this system were previously observed by smith @xmath13 higdon ( 1994 ) ; the new and old data have been combined .",
    "out of our nine interacting systems , the only unambiguous detection of co outside of the main disk of a galaxy is the star formation region in stephan s quintet . in two of our systems",
    "( ngc 3395/6 and the taffy galaxies ) , the two galaxies in the pair are separated by only 70@xmath4 @xmath0 90@xmath4 , and the star formation regions in the bridges are unresolved from the main disks with our beamsize .",
    "thus , although the bridge positions were detected in co , this may be emission from the galaxy disk in the 12 m beam .",
    "higher resolution follow - up observations are needed to confirm the existence of co in these regions .    in table 4 , we give the molecular gas mass for the galaxy disks , derived assuming the standard galactic n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratio ( 2.8 @xmath1 10@xmath23 @xmath3/(k km s@xmath11 ) ; bloemen et al .",

    "the h@xmath12 luminosity , molecular gas mass , and hi mass for the extra - disk source in stephan s quintet are similar to those of many normal spiral galaxies ( young et al .",

    "( 1999 ) , we suggested that star formation was inhibited in the eastern tail of ngc 2782 and the ngc 4438 co clump because of strong shocks sustained during a head - on collision between two gas - rich galaxies . if the extra - disk cloud in stephan s quintet was formed in this way , star formation is clearly not inhibited .",
    "to explain the peculiar morphology of stephan s quintet , a number of different interaction scenarios have been suggested .",
    "some of these scenarios involve ram pressure stripping during a head - on collision between two galaxies .",
    "for example , peterson @xmath13 shostak ( 1980 ) suggest that a head - on collision between ngc 7318b and ngc 7319 removed the gas and caused the radio continuum ridge between them .",
    "a different scenario was suggested by shostak et al .",
    "( 1984 ) : a prograde tidal encounter of ngc 7320c and ngc 7319 occurred , pulling gas out of these galaxies , creating the long tail south of ngc 7319 .",
    "this was followed by a high - speed collision between ngc 7318a and ngc 7318b .",
    "other scenarios involve a collision between an ` intruder galaxy ' ( usually ngc 7318b ) and intragalactic gas that had previously been tidally - stripped or ram pressure - stripped in an earlier encounter between two different galaxies in the group ( van der hulst @xmath13 rots 1981 ; moles et al .",
    "moles et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that a direct collision between the outlying galaxy ngc 7320c and ngc 7319 occurred in the recent past ( 10@xmath18 years ago ) , removing a large quantity of gas from these galaxies . after this event , ngc 7318b entered the group at high velocity , colliding with this stripped gas and triggering star formation .",
    "our new data shed some light on the question of the origin of the extra - disk gas in stephan s quintet .",
    "our detection of two co - rich components in the extra - disk star formation region shows that the star formation in this feature was triggered by a collision involving relatively high metallicity , molecule - rich gas concentrations , rather than metal - poor intracluster medium .",
    "this does not rule out ram pressure stripping of ngc 7318b by an intergalactic medium , but it does require that this intergalactic medium be relatively metal - rich gas : gas previously removed from a galaxy . how this gas was originally removed from the disk is unclear : as shown in arp 245 and ngc 3561 , structures apparently created by tidal forces can be relatively co - rich .",
    "thus this intergalactic gas may have been removed either by tidal forces , or via ram pressure stripping .",
    "the 6700 km s@xmath11 extra - disk component may have originally come from ngc 7319 or ngc 7318a , which have similar optical velocities ( 6650 km s@xmath11 and 6620 km s@xmath11 , respectively ; moles et al .",
    "the most likely candidate of these two is the barred spiral ngc 7319 , which shows a surprising lack of h  ii regions ( arp 1973 ) , a long optical tail , and a very offset co distribution ( yun et al .",
    "ngc 7318a also has an optical tail , however , this may have been created by another interaction .",
    "the 6000 km s@xmath11 extra - disk gas may have originated in either the outlying galaxy ngc 7320c or in ngc 7318b .",
    "ngc 7320c has an optical radial velocity of 6000 @xmath38 150 km s@xmath11 ( lynds 1972 ) , consistent with this velocity .",
    "previous arguments for the involvement of ngc 7320c ( moles et al .",
    "1997 ) cited the long tail south of ngc 7319 that points towards ngc 7320c .",
    "alternatively , this component of the extra - disk gas may have come from ngc 7318b . as noted above",
    ", our co observations show a faint co line in ngc 7318b at this velocity , redshifted 300 km s@xmath11 from the optical velocity .",
    "this detection corresponds to a molecular gas mass of 1.7 @xmath1 10@xmath17 m@xmath16 , assuming the standard n@xmath8/i@xmath9 conversion factor .",
    "we therefore suggest that the extra - disk gas undergoing star formation in stephan s quintet originated in ngc 7318b and ngc 7319 . at the present time it is unclear whether a single collision between ngc 7318b and ngc 7319 occurred , ram pressure stripping the gas and creating the shock front between the two galaxies , or whether gas had been removed from ngc 7319 earlier , by an earlier encounter with another galaxy , and then this gas was impacted by ngc 7318b .",
    "we have obtained new co ( 1 @xmath0 0 ) observations of eleven extragalactic tails and bridges , and compared these measurements with previously - published data for another thirteen features . of these 24 structures ,",
    "four have inferred m@xmath8/m@xmath26 upper limits ( assuming the galactic n@xmath8/i@xmath9 conversion factor ) less than global values for spiral galaxies , consistent with those found for irregular galaxies .",
    "three of these four co - poor features are in the ngc 7714/5 system ; the most extreme case is the star forming bridge , which has a very high hi column density ( 1.6 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3 in the 55@xmath4 co beam ) , yet was undetected in co , giving an inferred m@xmath8/m@xmath26 upper limit of @xmath140.063 .",
    "these features may have enhanced n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratios compared to the galactic value due to low metallicities .    of the 24 structures in our combined sample ,",
    "eight have been detected in co. three of these eight ( the stephan s quintet extra - disk source , the ngc 4038/9 tail , and the arp 245 tail ) have inferred efficiencies of star formation ( l@xmath29/m@xmath8 ) consistent with global values for spiral galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the l@xmath29/m@xmath8 ratios for the eastern tail of ngc 2782 and the ngc 4438 clump are lower than typical for disk galaxies , suggesting inhibited star formation . in none of the features",

    "of the eight detected features , two ( ngc 2782 and ngc 4438 ) have optical morphologies indicating head - on collisions .",
    "the stephan s quintet feature may also have been formed in this manner . in these systems",
    ", we suggest that metal - rich gas with an approximately galactic n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratio was pulled from the inner parts of the galaxies .",
    "a few recent studies have reported the detection of co in a number of classical tidal features ( e.g. , ngc 4038/9 , arp 245 , and ngc 3561 ) . in these structures",
    ", the hi column density may be locally high enough that the co self - shielding limit is exceeded , in spite of modestly enhanced n@xmath8/i@xmath9 ratios .",
    "there is a slight tendency for these tidal features to have lower m@xmath8/m@xmath26 ratios and higher l@xmath29/m@xmath8 ratios than ram pressure stripped features discussed above , but there is a large amount of scatter and the sample size is small .",
    "more observations are needed to determine whether there is truly a statistical difference in the gaseous and star formation properties of tidal and ram pressure stripped features .",
