    "the significant magnetoelectric coupling previously shown by the application of external magnetic fields did not surface in the far infrared to the extent we examined it .",

    "mixtures of analytical grade purity fe@xmath0o@xmath4 , teo@xmath0 and febr@xmath4 powder in molar ratio 1:6:1 were sealed in the quartz tubes with electronic grade hbr as the transport gas for the crystal growth .",

    "the measurements employed a bruker ifs 66-v / s spectrometer in conjunction with a 10  t oxford superconducting magnet and a 1.8 k silicon bolometer detector .",
    "a free standing wire grid polarizer was oriented along the preferential polarization direction of the synchrotron beam .    at this point",
    "it is important to establish with confidence that we cooled our single crystal below 10 k in both the oxford superconducting magnet and the janis flow cryostat .",

    "this same system has been used to accurately measure the properties of superconducting materials down to 2  k.@xcite the accuracy of the cooling capacity of the flow cryostat was corroborated by comparing ratios of @xmath23/@xmath24 for the superconductor nb@xmath25ti@xmath25n with those same ratios measured in the superconducting magnet . with",

    "for these low symmetry crystals , the dielectric constant is a @xmath27 tensor and will generally have off diagonal components . for every crystal symmetry , however , there exists a set of orthogonal cartesian axes , called the principal dielectric axes , which diagonalize the dielectric tensor . in an optics experiment ,",
    "the principal dielectric axes are found by rotating the orientation of the sample which is placed between two polarizers that are crossed and remain fixed . throughout a revolution of 360@xmath9 , four orthogonal orientations will result in zero transmitted light beyond the second polarizer .",
    "these four dark orientations correspond to the electric field of the incoming light aligning itself parallel to a principal dielectric axis of the system .    for a monoclinic system , the crystallographic",
    "_ b _ axis is unique because it is perpendicular to both the _ a _ and _ c _ axes .",
    "accordingly , one principal dielectric axis of the system is fixed along the crystallographic _ b _ axis , but the other two axes can orient themselves arbitrarily as long as they remain orthogonal .",
    "consequently , we performed single crystal x - ray diffraction on crystal 1 with knowledge of how the principal dielectric axes fell in relation to the crystal facets in order to determine their orientation with respect to the _ a _ and _ c _ crystallographic directions .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements were collected at 300  k on a four - circle panalytical xpert mrd in a parallel beam geometry with k@xmath28 radiation .",
    "a @xmath29 - 2@xmath29 scan was used to check that the sample surface corresponded to the _ bc _ plane while pole figure measurements were performed to find the spatial orientation of the _ a _ axis with respect to the _ bc _ plane .",
    "the diffraction experiment showed that the crystallographic _",
    "c _ axis also coincides with a principal dielectric axis of the system .",
    "furthermore , the third principal dielectric axis makes an 18@xmath9 angle with the crystallographic _ a _ axis .",
    "the xrd patterns acquired from the sample with the surface aligned perpendicular to the diffraction plane are displayed in fig .",
    "only very narrow ( h00 ) diffraction lines were observed , confirming that the sample was a high quality single crystal , with the surface aligned parallel to the _ bc _ plane .",

    "a strong sharpening of many modes accompanied by a hardening of resonance frequencies is observed with decreasing temperature .",
    "no drastic deviations from the room - temperature spectrum were observed along any of the three directions when cooling to 5  k. particular attention was given to the excitation spectrum slightly above and below the 10.6  k multiferroic ordering temperature .",
    "the absence of anomalies in the spectra upon cooling below 10.6  k gives strong support to the observation of no crystal symmetry change in the ordered state ; however , a subtle contradiction exists.@xcite the high temperature p2@xmath8/_c _ space group is centrosymmetric , but ferroelectricity , for which non centrosymmetry is a strict requirement , is observed below t@xmath33 .",
    "this in turn suggests that new infrared modes should accompany the transition .",
    "however , the small value of polarization measured ( 8.5 @xmath34c / m@xmath35 ) leads one to suspet that a subtle transition occurs and additional infrared modes are likely below our experimental resolution ( @xmath360.5 @xmath7 ) .",

    "no appreciable change in the spectra were observed for transmittance at 5  k measured along @xmath31 and @xmath32 with magnetic fields of 10  t applied along all three crystallographic directions . a class of low energy magnetic excitations called antiferromagnetic resonance modes ( afmr )",

    "we have used the measured reflectance and transmittance spectra of crystal 1 to extract the complex dielectric function . because kramers - kronig analysis requires a single - bounce reflectance spectrum over a broad frequency region",
    ", we must first correct the measured reflectance spectrum in regions where the crystal transmits by using a combined reflection and transmission analysis .",

    "[ high_freq ] ) .",
    "the low measured values were attributed to the scattering of light from facets existing on the back surface of crystal 1 . to compensate , we assumed a mask on the back surface of crystal 1 which lead to scaling the measured reflectance and transmittance up by a factor of 1.4 in the interval 150010000  @xmath7 , thus explaining the discrepancy between fig .",
