    "the evolutionary stage of a powerful extragalactic radio source is currently thought to be related to its linear size .",

    "+ compact steep - spectrum ( css ) and gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio sources are intrinsically small - sized ( linear size , ls @xmath115 - 20 kpc ) , powerful ( @xmath2 w hz@xmath3 ) extragalactic objects generally associated with distant ( z@xmath40.2 ) galaxies and quasars .",
    "their main characteristic is the steep radio spectrum ( @xmath5 0.5 , @xmath6 ) in the optically thin regime , that flattens and turns over at low frequencies , between 1 ghz and 30 mhz @xcite .",
    "the genuine youth of these objects was strongly supported by the determination of both the kinematic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radiative ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ages of a dozen of the most compact objects ( ls @xmath1 100 pc ) which turned out to be about 10@xmath710@xmath8 years . given their young age and the intrinsically small size , css / gps sources provide us with a unique opportunity to study how the radio emission evolves and which role the ambient medium plays on their growth during the first stages of their evolution .",
    "a dense , inhomogeneous environment may slow down the expansion of the radio source in the case one jet interacts with a dense cloud .",
    "although the confinement may not last for the entire source lifetime , it may cause an underestimate of the source age .",
    "+ the radio morphology of css / gps radio sources closely resembles that of fanaroff - riley type - ii radio galaxies @xcite , but on much smaller scale .",
    "their radio structure is usually termed _",
    "symmetric _ in the sense that the radio emission is found on the two opposite sides of the core ( when detected ) , giving rise to the classification of either compact symmetric objects ( csos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if they are smaller than 1 kpc , or medium - sized symmetric objects ( mso , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if they extend on scales up to 15 - 20 kpc .",
    "however , a large fraction of css and gps sources have a very asymmetric two - sided morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where one of the lobes is much brighter and closer to the core than the other .",
    "this kind of asymmetry can not be explained in terms of beaming effects and path delay , suggesting that the two jets are piercing their way through an inhomogeneous medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a strong indication of asymmetries produced by a jet - cloud interaction comes from the detection of atomic hydrogen in absorption only against the brighter ( and closer to core ) lobe in the css objects 3c49 and 3c268.3 @xcite , and in the restarted source 3c236 @xcite .",
    "moreover , evidence that the ionized gas may be inhomogeneously distributed around the radio source was provided by the detection of asymmetric free - free absorption against the two lobes in three of the most compact radio galaxies ( ls @xmath9 16 pc ) : j0428 + 3259 , j1511 + 0518 @xcite , and oq208 @xcite .",
    "all these indications suggest that in a substantial fraction of small objects the radio source is not uniformly enshrouded by a homogeneous environment and the two jets may experience different conditions during their propagation through the interstellar medium .",
    "although the gas is not dense enough to frustrate the jet expansion for the entire source lifetime ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it may slow down the source growth if a jet - cloud interaction takes place .",
    "the high fraction of asymmetric intrinsically - compact radio galaxies strongly supports this scenario .",

    "this result has been interpreted by assuming that compact sources are highly depolarized by the dense interstellar medium that enshrouds the radio emission and acts as a faraday screen .",
    "support to this idea is the detection of some level of polarized emission as we consider higher frequencies , while the sources are completely unpolarized at the lower frequencies .",
    "+ from our vla observations , we found that 9 out of the 10 sources studied here are unpolarized at 5 ghz , in good agreement with the expectation .",
    "the radio source 1358 + 624 , unpolarized in our 5 ghz observations , turned out to be polarized at 15 ghz @xcite , suggesting that strong depolarization is taking place in this source .",
    "+ only the quasar 0319 + 121 turned out to be significantly polarized , with a fractional polarization of about 5.5% .",
    "since polarimetric observations are available at one frequency only , we can not determine the rotation measure ( rm ) .",
    "however , if we assume a low rm , we obtain that the magnetic field is parallel to the vlbi jet axis , as it is observed in quasars .",
    "the presence of significant percentage of polarized emission , together with the core - jet structure , suggests that this source may be oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of sight and its linear size may be foreshortened by projection effects .",
    "we presented the results from global - vlbi observations at 5 ghz of a sample of 10 out of 16 css sources from the sample presented by @xcite .",
    "the majority of the targets have a two - sided structure and the radio emission is dominated by lobes , jets , and hotspots .",
    "one sources , 0319 + 121 , has a core - jet morphology and the radio emission comes mainly from the core component .",
    "this object is the only one with significant polarized emission .",
    "high polarization level is uncommon in css sources , where the interstellar medium enshrouding the radio source acts as a faraday screen causing severe depolarization of the radio emission .",
    "+ the determination of the nature of the source components has been provided by the availability of two - frequency observations which allowed the study of the spectral index distribution across the whole source .",

    "the brightest lobe is the farthest from the core , in agreement with what is expected in case of projection effects .",
    "the evidence that the ambient medium may play a decisive role in producing asymmetric objects is supported by the galaxies 0316 + 161 , 0404 + 768 and 0428 + 205 , where the brightest lobe is also the closest to the core .",
