    "we illustrate how this works in a class of supersymmetric models where the lepton number is broken , together with the so - called @xmath0 parity symmetry  @xcite .",
    "even when the latter holds as a symmetry at the lagrangian level , as in some so(10 ) unification schemes , @xmath0 parity breaking may be driven spontaneously by a nonzero vacuum expectation value of an 21 singlet sneutrino  @xcite . in this case",
    "the low - energy theory is no longer described by the minimal supersymmetric standard model , but contains new @xmath0 parity violating interactions  @xcite .",
    "the simplest realization of this scenario leads to an effective model with bilinear violation of @xmath0 parity  @xcite .",
    "the latter constitutes the minimal way to break @xmath0 parity in the minimal supersymmetric standard model and provides the simplest intrinsically supersymmetric way to induce neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "its main feature is that it relates lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) decay properties and neutrino mixing angles @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrate that indeed , under realistic assumptions , the simplest scenario for neutrino masses in supersymmetry ( susy ) with bilinear violation of @xmath0 parity can be tested at the lhc in a crucial way and potentially falsified .",

    "we begin our analysis demanding that the events pass some basic requirements to guarantee that they will be triggered by the experimental collaborations .",
    "this is done because the lhc experiments have not defined so far any specific strategy to trigger displaced vertices with such high invariant mass , therefore , we restricted our analysis to events that would be accepted by the ongoing analyses .",

    "we made a conservative assumption , since we are not performing a detailed detector simulation , that the ellipsoid dimensions are 5 times the atlas expected resolutions in the transverse plane ( @xmath30 m ) and in the beam direction ( @xmath31 m ) , in order to ensure that the neutralino displaced vertex is distant of the primary vertex .",
    "we also demand that all tracks must be initiated inside the pixel inner detector within a radius of @xmath32 mm and @xmath29 axis length of @xmath33 mm .",

    "note that this cut should eliminate standard model ( sm ) backgrounds coming from displaced vertices associated to @xmath38 s or @xmath39 s . to guarantee a high quality in the reconstruction of the displaced vertices we impose that the @xmath34 decay jets must be central , having pseudorapidities @xmath40",
    "; this constitutes our cut * c4*. the events passing the above requirements most probably originate from lsp decay , having basically no sizable standard model background , except for instrumental backgrounds and beam - gas interactions .",
    "a signal vertex is classified as originating from the lsp decay into a @xmath41 pair if it presents a @xmath42 and a hadronically decaying @xmath34 stemming from the displaced vertex with transverse momentum @xmath43 gev and @xmath40 . in the @xmath44 case we demanded that the @xmath44 associated to a detached @xmath34 possesses @xmath23 gev and @xmath45 .",
    "these requirements are called * c5*.    detecting taus is somewhat more complicated than detecting muons , so one needs to be more careful in reconstructing the @xmath46 pair displaced vertex .",
    "the following criteria , denoted * c6 * , are used to separate the detached vertices exhibiting a @xmath44 through its 1- and 3-prong decay modes .",
    "we check also that the secondary displaced vertex from tau decay does not spoil the signal vertex ; _ i.e. _ , we verify that the tau decay products point towards the lsp decay vertex within the experimental resolution .",
    "we define the neutralino resolution ellipsoid as the ellipsoid centered at the displaced vertex position of neutralino , @xmath47 , with axes @xmath48 m and @xmath49 m based on ref .",
    "let @xmath50 be the momentum of either 1prong tau decay or the sum of momenta of the 3prong decays .",

    "we verify whether the line along @xmath52 , crossing @xmath51 intersects the neutralino resolution ellipsoid . for this",
    "we require that for each @xmath39 , the discriminant of quadratic equation for parameter @xmath53 @xmath54 be equal to or greater than zero .",
    "in previous @xcite analysis only 3-prong tau decays modes were considered .",
    "an additional cut * c7 * was applied to 3prong tau events , _",
    "i.e. _ we also require that one of the prongs has a transverse momentum @xmath55 gev while the other two have @xmath56 gev .",
    "in addition we check if all prongs lie within a cone radius of @xmath57 around the tau direction obtained from the prongs tracks .",
    "finally we require that the signal lepton ( @xmath58 or @xmath39 ) be isolated ; cut * c8*. @xmath58 isolation demands that there are no other tracks whose total transverse energy satisfies @xmath59  gev within a cone @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath39 was required to be isolated using the same criteria as for the muon , but for an annulus of outer radius @xmath61 and inner radius @xmath62 .",
    "isolation of the leptons is a needed requirement to eliminate events presenting leptons generated inside jets and constitutes an important cut to reduce potential backgrounds .",
    "in order to access the effects of the above defined cuts * c1**c8 * we present detailed information on their effects for the msugra sps1a benchmark point @xcite characterized by @xmath63gev , @xmath64gev , @xmath65gev , @xmath3 , and @xmath66 .",
    "this allows us to compare our results with the one previously obtained in @xcite . for the default solution of ` spheno ` to the neutrino masses and mixings , the relevant neutralino branching ratios are @xmath67 with the @xmath0 parity parameters being @xmath68 furthermore , for this choice of parameters the neutralino decay length is @xmath69 and it travels an average of 4.4  mm in the laboratory .",

    ". additional suppression of the signal by * c3 * comes from the matching of the sum of momenta of the charged tracks pointing to the detached vertex and the jets reconstructed using ` pythia ` . to further illustrate the @xmath34 decay , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : mwinv ] the jet  jet invariant mass distribution . as we can see",
    ", this distribution is clearly peaked around the @xmath34 mass and a good fraction of the two jets reconstructed as associated to the lsp decay pass the cut * c3*. the observed high efficiency of cut * c4 * shows that the @xmath34 s produced in the lsp decay are rather central .     without cuts , with cut on lepton isolation ( @xmath58 or @xmath39 ) and with all other cuts leaving free the invariant mass range . ]",
    "we also learn from table  [ tab : cuts ] that detached vertices presenting a @xmath34 possess around 60% of the time an energetic @xmath42 or @xmath44 complying with * c5*. moreover the cuts * c6 * and * c7 * , which ensure the quality of the @xmath39 reconstruction , reduce significantly the number of @xmath71 events .",
    "finally the isolation cut * c8 * turns out to be quite important significantly reducing the signal .    for the parameter point sps1a ,",
    "the expected efficiencies for the reconstruction of @xmath41 and @xmath46 decays are 0.107 and 0.0098 respectively , where in the last we have added 1 and 3prong hadronic decays .",
    "when the @xmath39 decays into a @xmath58 and neutrinos , the event was computed as being a @xmath41 decay if the @xmath58 passes the cuts .",
    "this was included appropriately in our calculations .",
    "taking into account the total susy production cross section ( 41 pb ) at 14 tev , an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath72 and these efficiencies we anticipate that the number of observed @xmath41 and @xmath46 events after cuts to be @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the statistical accuracy of the ratio @xmath75 is expected to be @xmath76 . in the case one",
    "takes into account only the three - prong decays of the tau , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the statistical error of this ratio increases to @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , as expected , there is a degradation of the accuracy in the determination of this ratio of branching ratios in a more realistic analysis ; the result obtained in @xcite is @xmath78 .",
    "in the evaluation of the above efficiencies we have not taken into account multiple interactions at the lhc as needed for the high luminosity run .",
    "therefore , we reevaluated the detection efficiencies for muons and taus with multiple interactions switched on in ` pythia ` .",
    "we found that these efficiencies were only slightly degraded by the occurrence of pileup , that is , we obtained that the efficiencies for muon reconstruction are reduced to @xmath79 and for tau are @xmath80 in hadronic mode and @xmath81 in the 3-prong mode . in our analyses we took into account the effect of multiple interactions .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we present a detailed analysis for a different msugra point that is @xmath82gev , @xmath83gev , @xmath65gev , @xmath3 , and @xmath66 . once again using ` spheno ` , we obtain that the neutralino branching ratios larger than @xmath84 are : @xmath85 and the corresponding @xmath0 parity parameters are @xmath86 as we can see , the neutralino lsp decays are dominated by the two  body ones , in contrast with the sps1a point where the three  body decays mediated by light scalars are dominant . because of its heavier spectrum , the total susy production for this parameter point is smaller than the sps1a one ; however , the cross section loss is partially compensated by the higher branching ratios into @xmath41 and @xmath46 .",
    "the total cross section for this case is @xmath87 fb and our analyses indicate that the reconstruction efficiency for @xmath41 decays is 0.203 while the @xmath46 decays are reconstructed with an efficiency of 0.035 , where we did not take into account pileup .",
    "the inclusion of this effect leads to a tiny reduction of the reconstruction efficiencies that become 0.199 for @xmath41 and 0.033 for @xmath46 . on the other hand",
    "the efficiency for reconstructing a @xmath46 event in the 3prong mode is 0.012 .",
    "notice that these efficiencies are larger for this msugra point than for the sps1a because the neutralino is heavier and , consequently , its decay products are more energetic and pass the cuts more easily .",
    "the expected total number of reconstructed events after cuts for this susy point is @xmath88 and @xmath89 where we have included the pileup effects .",
    "therefore , the expected statistical error on the ratio @xmath0 becomes @xmath90 , or @xmath91 when we only use 3prong taus as in @xcite . as we can see , the statistical error on the ratio @xmath0 increases as @xmath92 ( lsp mass ) increases due to the reduction of the susy production cross section despite the increase in the detection efficiencies .",
