    "the problem is formidable in complexity due to its multi - faceted nature .",
    "a unique theory that solves this problem once and for all is yet to be developed .",
    "meanwhile , with the help of simpler , physically transparent theoretical models , theorists have been unraveling most unusual aspects of @xmath0@c@xmath8 confined atoms , thereby identifying the most useful experimental studies , which could be performed .",
    "much of attention has been turned to various aspects of photo - ionization of endohedral atoms .",
    "the interested reader is referred to review papers @xcite as well as some recent papers and references therein in addition to other references presented in this paper , for a detailed introduction into the subject .",
    "many important insights into @xmath0@c@xmath1 photoionization have been obtained on the basis of the @xmath9-potential @xcite and @xmath10-potential @xcite models . in the @xmath7-potential model the c@xmath1 cage",
    "is assumed to have the zero thickness and is modeled by a spherical @xmath7-function potential @xmath11 of an inner radius @xmath12 and depth @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath9-potential model accounts for the finite thickness @xmath9 of the c@xmath1 cage .",
    "it models the cage by a square well potential of the width @xmath9 .",
    "one of spectacular findings , obtained on the basis of these models , has been the discovery of resonances , termed confinement resonances ( crs)@xcite and correlation confinement resonances ( ccr s ) @xcite , in the photoionization spectrum of an endohedral atom .",
    "cr s ( also referred to as _ ordinary _",
    "cr s in this paper ) occur in photoionization spectra of endohedral atoms due to interference of the photoelectron waves emerging directly from the confined atom @xmath0 , and those scattered off the c@xmath1 carbon cage .",
    "ccr s differ from these ordinary cr s in that they occur in the spectrum of an _",
    "outer _ subshell of the confined atom @xmath0 due to interference of transitions from this subshell with ordinary cr s emerging in _ inner _ shell transitions , via interchannel coupling @xcite .",
    "ccr s represent a novel class of resonances that can exist neither without confinement nor electron correlation .",

    "this has stimulated a photoionization experiment that led to a recent experimental discovery of cr s in the xe@c@xmath15 @xmath2 photoionization spectrum @xcite .",

    "( note , beforehand , that for this reason primarily the @xmath7-potential model is employed in the present paper study ) .",
    "in contrast to photoionization cross sections of endohedral atoms , little is known about their generalized oscillator strengths ( gos s ) .",
    "gos s reflect the atomic response to fast electron impact ionization .",
    "they are more complicated and informative parameters than corresponding photoionization cross sections .",
    "this is because , generally , many more multipolar transitions contribute to electron impact ionization of atoms versus primarily dipole transition contributions to the photoionization process , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the electron spectroscopy of quantum objects thus serves as another powerful tool for the study of their structures .",
    "however , to date , gos s of endohedral atoms were investigated only in the theoretical work @xcite , and there has been no associated experimental studies performed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ionization of the innermost @xmath16 subshells of endohedral he@c@xmath1 and ne@c@xmath1 by fast electrons was chosen as the case study . both the @xmath7- and @xmath14-potential models were employed in the study .",
    "electron correlation was not accounted for .",
    "it was shown that , much as due to photoionization , noticeable ordinary cr s emerge in gos s of endohedral atoms as well .    the above mentioned finding on gos s of endohedral atoms is the only known to date confinement - related - feature of their electron impact ionization .",
    "the knowledge on a possible significance of electron correlation in gos s of @xmath0@c@xmath1 atoms is ultimately absent , despite its obvious importance .",
    "the present paper fills in this vacancy in one s knowledge .",
    "it advances the initial understanding of gos s of such atoms by accounting for a mutual impact of confinement and correlation on the ionization process . with the general impetus of the successful experimental study of cr s in the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath2 photoionization @xcite ,",
    "we , too , choose to explore the xe@c@xmath1 , as the case study .",
    "we focus on the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 gos s upon fast electron impact ionization of the confined xe assuming that the transferred to the atom energy exceeds the @xmath2 threshold which is approximately @xmath17 ev .",
    "this is in order to avoid dealing with the c@xmath1 dynamical polarization impact on an @xmath0@c@xmath1 atom , which is known to be strong at lower energies @xcite , to simplify matters .",
    "confinement effects are then accounted for primarily in the framework of the @xmath10-potential model without regard for said dynamical polarization of c@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath9-potential model is employed in some instances as well , to evaluate the finite - potential - width - impact on the xe@c@xmath1 gos s . in the calculations , the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) is used for the fast incoming and scattered electrons .",
    "a hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation in the presence of the c@xmath1 confinement is employed relative to the confined atom itself .",
    "this completes gos s calculations in the zero - order approximation ( omitting correlation ) .",

    "we now turn to the description of gos s of @xmath0@c@xmath1 endohedral atoms .",
    "let us first employ the @xmath10-potential model @xcite to account for the c@xmath1 confining cage .",
    "this model exploits the following two key assumptions .",
    "first , it is assumed that the size of a confined atom is much smaller than the c@xmath1 radius r@xmath44 , @xmath45 a.u .",
    "this allows one to equal the ground state energies and electronic wave - functions of the confined atom to those of the free atom .",
    "second , it is assumed that the thickness @xmath9 of the c@xmath1 cage is much smaller than the wavelength of the outgoing electron released upon ionization of the confined atom .",
    "hence , the thickness can be disregarded at all , i.e. , @xmath9 @xmath35 @xmath46 , to a good approximation .",
    "correspondingly , one can model the c@xmath1 cage by the @xmath10-function - like potential @xmath47 : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 a.u .",
    "is the potential depth which was found @xcite by matching the calculated electron affinity ( @xmath50 ) of c@xmath1 to the known one , @xmath51 ev @xcite .",
    "the confinement brought impact on the ionization process is then associated only with modification of the wave - function @xmath52 of an outgoing electron due to its scattering off the confining cage . the modification results @xcite in @xmath52 which differs from that of the free atom @xmath53 only by a multiplicative factor @xmath54 ( @xmath55 being the momentum of an outgoing electron ) :",
    "@xmath56    where @xmath57 \\label{dlk}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath58 is the irregular - at - zero solution of the hf equation for the isolated atom , whereas @xmath59 is the additional to the free atom phase shift due to the @xmath10-potential well : @xmath60    with the help of eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) , the hf matrix element for the confined atom gos amplitude , labeled as @xmath61 , differs @xcite from that of the free atom , @xmath62 , eq .",

    "( [ dlk ] ) , the coefficient @xmath66 has an oscillatory character versus @xmath55 ( and , hence , versus the transferred to the atom energy @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , there are resonances - confinement resonances - emerging in the transition matrix elements for @xmath0@c@xmath1 atoms .",
    "they translate into resonances either in their photoionization cross sections or , what is more important to us , generalized oscillator strengths @xcite .    in the framework of the alternative @xmath14-potential model , the potential @xmath47 , eq .",

    "we employ the values of @xmath71 a.u .  and @xmath72 a.u .",
    "since they were proven @xcite to result in the best possible @xmath14-model description of experimentally observed cr s in the xe@c@xmath15 @xmath2 photoionization cross section @xcite .",
    "corresponding hf gos s amplitudes @xmath73 are then calculated with the help of the thus found wavefunctions @xmath70 .    to account for rpae electron correlation in gos s of @xmath0@c@xmath1 atoms in either of the discussed models ,",
    "the standard free - atom - rpae - equation is turned into the `` confined - atom - rpae - equation '' by a straightforward replacement of all free atomic excited state wavefunctions @xmath74 by the above discussed wavefunctions @xmath75 or @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "similar to the used @xmath7hf and @xmath14hf abbreviations , we refer to such confined - atom - rpae methodology as @xmath7rpae and @xmath14rpae , respectively .",
    "in particular , the @xmath7rpae equation transforms into @xmath77 the intershell interaction term in the @xmath7rpae equation ( the second term on the right - hand - side of the equation ) explicitly depends on the oscillatory parameter @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the @xmath7rpae approximation is capable of accounting for ccr s in the gos s spectra .",
    "it accounts for ordinary cr s as well , owing to the term @xmath78 ( the first term on the right - hand - side of the @xmath7rpae equation ) which itself is determined by eq .",
    "( [ @qhf ] ) .    as for the alternative @xmath14rpae equation , the latter accounts for cr s and ccr s implicitly , via final - state and intermediate - state functions @xmath79 .",
    "our @xmath10hf , @xmath9hf , @xmath10rpae and @xmath9rpae calculated results for the @xmath2 gos s @xmath80 of xe@c@xmath1 , upon fast electron impact ionization , are presented in fig .",

    "rpae and @xmath10rpae calculations included dominant intershell interaction between transitions from @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 subshells .",

    "furthermore , interesting , relative intensities and positions of these cr s appear to be noticeably changing with increasing value of @xmath23 in the whole energy region , including near threshold .",
    "as a results , the calculated @xmath93 and @xmath94 have little to do with @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , this impact also results in that the gos s of free xe and , on the average , of xe@c@xmath1 are found to exhibit a strong , broad resonance for @xmath81 and @xmath96 in contrast to @xmath97 , in the energy region under discussion . to understand this",
    ", we also plotted in fig .",
    "[ e - xe4d ] calculated data of a trial @xmath7rpae calculation [ labeled as @xmath98 accounting only for dipole contributions to the @xmath2 gos s .",
    "the comparison of the total gos @xmath80 with @xmath99 shows the dominant role of dipole transitions in the ionization process for smaller @xmath23 s , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , both for free xe and xe@c@xmath1 [ note , for @xmath81 dipole channels exceed other channels by several orders of magnitude , for which reason @xmath80 is undistinguished from @xmath98 .",
    "the xe dipole @xmath2 @xmath100 @xmath101 transition is known to exhibit a strong resonance versus @xmath24 , known as the @xmath2 giant resonance @xcite . consequently , the nature of the strong , broad resonance seen in the @xmath2 gos s at @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the same as in the case of the xe @xmath2 photoionization , i.e. , it is the familiar @xmath2 dipole giant resonance . for a larger value of @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath97 , other channels beyond the dipole channel acquire considerable strengths compared to the dipole channel .",
    "this can be judged by comparing total @xmath80 with partial @xmath99 for @xmath97 displayed in fig .",
    "[ e - xe4d ] .",
    "this explains why @xmath95 has , in general , little in common with the @xmath2 gos s for smaller @xmath23 s , as well as why @xmath102 does not exhibit the @xmath2 giant resonance - dipole transitions matter little .",
    "thus , the transferred momentum as well as multipolar impacts on the @xmath2 gos s of both free xe and xe@c@xmath1 are found to be considerable",
    ".    moreover , fig .",
    "[ e - xe4d ] additionally features a varying role of multipolar contributions to gos s near threshold .",
    "a trial calculation showed that the first resonance maximum in @xmath2 gos s near threshold is primarily due to monopole channels for @xmath96 , whereas it is mainly due to octupole channels for a larger @xmath97 .    finally , it also obvious from fig .",
    "[ e - xe4d ] that the alternative @xmath14rpae calculation of the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath2 gos results in lower and yet clearly prominent intensities of emerged cr s compared to the @xmath7rpae data ; this is in line with results of the previous theoretical study @xcite .",
    "note , since gos s of endohedral atoms have been experimentally unexplored , the question of which of the used models is most appropriate remains open .",
    "we now proceed to the discussion of the xe and xe@c@xmath1 @xmath3 gos s .",

    "of free xe ( hf and rpae ) and xe@c@xmath1 ( @xmath90hf and @xmath90rpae ) . @xmath105rpae * labels the fictitious calculated data for the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath3 gos s ( see text).,width=264 ]    the calculated data show that , as in the known case of the xe @xmath3 photoionization @xcite , the @xmath3 gos s of free xe are ultimately affected by electron correlation , both for smaller and bigger values of @xmath23 .",
    "this clearly follows from the comparison of corresponding hf and rpae calculated data .",
    "the same tendency is found to preserve in endohedral xe@c@xmath1 as well , cf .",
    "@xmath7hf and @xmath7rpae calculated data . furthermore , similar to @xmath2 gos s ,",
    "the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath3 gos s are found to be dramatically distorted by confinement .",
    "indeed , the presence of the c@xmath1 confinement results in the emergence of three strong oscillations ( resonances ) in @xmath104 at given @xmath106 s , cf .",
    "rpae and @xmath7rpae calculated data .",
    "noting that the resonance positions are about the same as the position of ordinary cr s in the @xmath2 gos s at approximately @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 ev , one might be tempted to interpret the resonances in @xmath3 gos s as ccr s , i.e. , being induced in @xmath104 by the three ordinary cr s in @xmath2 ionization channels , via intershell interaction , as in the case of the xe@c@xmath1 5s photoionization @xcite .",
    "this , however , would not be entirely correct . indeed , e.g. , such interpretation would fail to explain why a weak cr in @xmath110 at about @xmath107 ev induces as strong ccr in @xmath111 as the two other stronger neighboring resonances .",
    "the actual origin of the three emerged resonances in @xmath3 gos s is thus intriguing .    to unravel the nature of the three resonances in question in @xmath111 of xe@c@xmath1 , we performed a fictitious trial @xmath7rpae calculation of the @xmath3 gos s .",
    "there , we artificially eliminated ordinary cr s from corresponding coupling @xmath2 ionization channels in @xmath10rpae , eq .",
    "( [ @rpae ] ) .",
    "this was achieved by substituting the excited wavefunctions of the @xmath2 electrons of _ free _ xe instead of those of xe@c@xmath1 into eq .",
    "( [ @rpae ] ) . this fictitious methodology will be referred to / labeled as @xmath7rpae*. corresponding @xmath7rpae * calculated data are depicted in fig .",
    "[ e - xe5s ] as well .",
    "one interesting important observation is that @xmath7rpae * intershell interaction noticeably increases cr s presented in @xmath7hf calculated @xmath111 for both values of @xmath23 and also shifts a lower energy cr in @xmath112 from about @xmath113 to about @xmath107 ev .",
    "such @xmath7rpae * calculation , however , does not bring a third ( middle ) resonance in @xmath111 .",
    "this resonance emerges only in a true @xmath7rpae calculation ( which accounts for cr s in @xmath2 ionization channels ) of @xmath111 , and its position coincides with that of a middle resonance in @xmath2 gos s .",
    "thus , our first conclusion in unraveling the nature of the three resonances in @xmath111 is that the middle resonance is undoubtedly correlation confinement resonance , ccr , by nature [ it does not exist without simultaneous impact of intershell interaction and confinement on @xmath111 ] .",
    "what about the left and right resonances in @xmath111 ?",
    "their nature is more complicated .",
    "qualitatively , they exist in @xmath111 even without coupling with cr s in @xmath2 ionization channels ( see @xmath7rpae * calculated data ) , i.e. , the resonances uncovered by the performed @xmath7rpae * calculation are ordinary cr s . in a rare , unique occasion ,",
    "these cr s ( see @xmath7rpae * calculated data ) peak at about the same energies as the left and right _ ordinary _ cr s in @xmath2 gos s , fig .",
    "[ e - xe4d ] . therefore ,",
    "when the @xmath2 cr s are accounted for in a true @xmath7rpae calculation they strongly affect the two originally existing @xmath7rpae * ordinary cr s in @xmath111 , thereby enhancing them , via intershell interaction .",
    "thus , the left and right resonances in true @xmath7rpae calculated data for @xmath111 are the result of intershell coupling of the ordinary cr s in @xmath2 channels with _ existing _ ordinary cr s in @xmath3 ionization channels . therefore , the left and right resonances in @xmath111 are neither purely ordinary cr s nor purely ccr s .",
    "rather , they may be termed as _ cr - cr - correlation - interference - resonances _ - a new type of resonances which have not been met earlier , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "this interpretation , in particular , explains why the lower left resonance in @xmath111 is as strong as the middle ccr . to start with , it was relatively strong from the very beginning ( see @xmath7rpae * calculated data ) .",
    "next , the interaction with a weaker left @xmath2 cr makes this @xmath3 resonance somewhat stronger , so that it now matches the middle ccr which is brought about by the strongest middle cr in the @xmath2 channel . to summarize , the discussed @xmath3 gos resonance spectrum of xe@c@xmath1 has neither a purely cr nor ccr nature .",
    "rather , it consists of one ccr and two cr - cr - correlation - interference - resonances .",
    "note , this makes the @xmath3 gos spectrum of xe@c@xmath1 be unique and different in its origin from corresponding @xmath3 xe@c@xmath1 photoionization spectrum @xcite which consists of purely ccr s .    of specific interest",
    "are the gos s of @xmath4 electrons in the considered @xmath24 region .",
    "since it is well above the @xmath4 ionization threshold , @xmath115 for xe@c@xmath1 could have been expected to have negligible or very weak , at best , cr s .",
    "this seems to be in line with a theory of scattering of particles off a potential well or barrier .",
    "indeed , at a sufficiently high energy of the outgoing electron , the corresponding coefficient of reflection off a finite potential well or barrier is small . as a result ,",
    "the interference effect between the outgoing and scattered electron waves becomes weak , and so are the associated cr s .",
    "this , however , is true only in terms of an independent particle approximation . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where photoionization of endofullerenes was chosen as a case study , cr s can reappear - resurrect - and be strong at the transferred to the atom energy far exceeding ( by thousands of ev ) the @xmath18 ionization threshold , as a general phenomenon .",
    "this will happen at transferred energies , which correspond to opening of inner - shell photoionization channels , whose intensities exceed by far the intensity of transitions from the outer subshell of the confined atom and which are strongly coupled with the innershell transitions .",
    "this is just the case with the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath4 ionization above the @xmath2 threshold . indeed , as known from photoionization studies @xcite , the xe @xmath4 ionization is affected strongly by intershell interaction with @xmath2 transitions .",
    "as was found above , the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath2 gos s are ( a ) strong and ( b ) have pronounced cr s , see fig .",
    "[ e - xe4d ] .",
    "therefore , one can predict the emergence of strong ccr s in the xe @xmath4 gos when intershell interaction between the @xmath4 and @xmath2 ionization amplitudes is accounted for in @xmath7rpae calculation , as in the above detailed case of @xmath3 gos s . corresponding hf , rpae , @xmath7hf and @xmath7rpae calculated data for @xmath115 for @xmath81 are depicted in fig .",

    "the presented results are self - explanatory . in brief",
    ", there is the only weak cr related oscillation in the @xmath7hf calculated @xmath4 gos for @xmath81 , in contrast to three strong resonance features present in the @xmath7rpae calculated data .",
    "the latter are found to be induced in the @xmath4 gos by cr s in the @xmath2 gos amplitudes , i.e. , they are ccr s .",
    "they are strong , in a full accordance with the above made prediction .",
    "in addition , calculated data show that , as in the known case of the free xe @xmath4 photoionization @xcite , the @xmath4 gos s of both free xe and xe@c@xmath1 are completely determined by intershell correlation with the @xmath2 subshell .",
    "this clearly follows from the comparison between hf and rpae calculated data on the one hand , and @xmath7hf and @xmath7rpae calculated data on the other hand .",
    "in the present work we focused on the study of the impact of the c@xmath1 confinement on the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 generalized oscillator strengths of xe@c@xmath1 , in the energy region above the @xmath2 threshold , where , in our opinion , the most interesting effects occur .",
    "we hope that the discovered impact of the transferred momentum @xmath23 , electron correlation , and confinement on generalized oscillators strengths of xe@c@xmath1 will challenge experimentalists to verify our predictions .",
    "theorists , we hope , will be driven by the desire to improve the made predictions with the help of more sophisticated theories .",
    "all this would indisputably result in uncovering of a richer variety of possible effects outside of the made predictions , thereby advancing this field of endeavor .",

    "<S> the impact of both confinement and electron correlation on generalized oscillator strengths ( gos s ) of endohedral atoms , @xmath0@c@xmath1 , is theoretically studied choosing the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 fast electron impact ionization as the case study . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are performed in the transferred to the atom energy region beyond the @xmath2 threshold , @xmath5@xmath6 ev . the calculation methodology combines the plane wave born approximation , hartree - fock approximation , and random phase approximation with exchange in the presence of the c@xmath1 confinement . </S>",
    "<S> the confinement is modeled by a spherical @xmath7-function - like potential as well as by a square well potential to evaluate the effect of the finite thickness of the c@xmath1 cage on the xe@c@xmath1 gos s . </S>",
    "<S> dramatic distortion of the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 gos s by the confinement is demonstrated , compared to the free atom . </S>",
    "<S> considerable contributions of multipolar transitions beyond dipole transitions in the calculated gos s is revealed , in some instances . </S>",
    "<S> the vitality of accounting for electron correlation in calculation of the xe@c@xmath1 @xmath3 and @xmath4 gos s is shown . </S>"
