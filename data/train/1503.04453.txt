    "recent experimental realization of quantum degenerate fermi gases of magnetic atoms @xcite and the rapid progress toward creating degenerate polar molecules @xcite have opened a new frontier for exploring novel phases of quantum gases , where dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) plays a central role .",

    "the latter has been associated with majorana fermions and can be used for topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "such exotic superfluid phases emerge from the long - range ddi with a strong anisotropy , which differs from the widely studied contact potential in dilute atomic gases .",
    "moreover , the relative ddi strength can be tuned by changing the fermion number density @xmath4 ( or fermi wavevector @xmath5 ) and , in the case of polar molecules @xcite , by varying an external electric field strength .    of particular interest",

    "in contrast , such a crossover in dipolar fermi gases , where richer physics may arise , is yet to be explored .",
    "existing theoretical studies in this aspect mostly focus on the ground state , based on mean field treatments @xcite , which are inadequate in addressing moderate and strong coupling regimes at finite temperature .    in this paper",

    "dipolar fermi gases in 3d , with an emphasis on the finite temperature and interaction effects . built on previous work @xcite that has been applied successfully to address various bcs - bec crossover phenomena in two - component fermi gases with a contact interaction @xcite , here we construct a similar pairing fluctuation theory for the superfluidity of fully polarized _",

    "the emergence of the pdw state originates from the long range nature of the ddi , which essentially put the system in the high density regime .",
    "the @xmath1-wave symmetry leads further to a non - local effect @xcite and hence a diverging coherence length in the nodal @xmath11-plane , _ which makes it difficult for the pairs to move in the @xmath8 direction , without heavily colliding with each other .",

    "we emphasize that _ the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath2 as a function of pairing strength , as found in our @xmath9-matrix approach of the pairing fluctuation theory @xcite , can be understood on physical grounds , without invoking specific details of the theory .",

    ", @xmath2 follows the mean - field behavior . as the pairing strength increases towards unitarity , the chemical potential decreases , leading to a shrinking fermi surface and thus a decreasing density of state ( dos ) @xmath129 . at the same time",
    ", a pseudogap develops gradually due to strong pairing correlations , which causes a further depletion of the dos at the fermi level .",
    "both these effects cause a reduction of @xmath2 , as one can naively expect from the bcs formula for @xmath2 .",
    "such effects will reach their utmost when the fermi surface disappears completely at @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to have a maximum of @xmath2 within the fermionic regime .",
    "the actual position of the maximum depends largely on the range of the pairing interaction , and is close to unitarity in the contact potential limit . on the other hand ,",
    "as the pseudogap develops , fermions form pairs . upon entering the bosonic regime ,",
    "essentially all fermions are paired .",
    "the bec temperature of these pairs increases with the pairing strength , as the pair density does .",
    "this explains why the combined @xmath2 exhibits a minimum around @xmath130 . at this point ,",
    "the effective pair mass @xmath131 is significantly heavier than @xmath124 , due to the repulsive interaction between pairs . as the pairing strength increases further into the bec regime , the pair size shrinks , and the inter - pair scattering length decreases , so that @xmath131 decreases gradually towards @xmath124 .",
    "as a consequence , _ the bose condensation temperature @xmath2 of the pairs necessarily increases towards its bec asymptote from below_. within a @xmath9-matrix approximation , these arguments are independent of the specific form of the pair susceptibility .",
    "we note that the emergence of the pdw state has to do with the long range nature of the ddi , which essentially put the system in the high density regime . at the same time , due to the @xmath1 symmetry , the coherence length @xmath132 diverges in the nodal @xmath11-plane ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) so that the order parameter @xmath134 exhibits a non - local effect similar to the case of a @xmath135-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath136 is the fermi velocity ) .",
    "_ such a diverging in - plane coherence length makes it difficult for the pairs to move in the @xmath8 direction , without heavily colliding with other pairs .",
    "_ at certain intermediate interaction strength , pairing is strong while the pair size is large , so that the repulsive interaction between pairs becomes strong .",
    "indeed , a careful look at the effective inverse pair mass reveals that before entering the pdw state , the pair mass already becomes heavy due to strong pair - pair repulsion .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy of the pairs ( in the @xmath8 direction ) becomes much smaller than the growing potential energy between pairs , in favor of forming a wigner - like crystal structure , which is what we call the pdw state .",
    "formation of such a crystal structure and minimization of the pair dispersion at a finite momentum suppress the superfluid @xmath2 down to zero .",
    "such a periodic crystal structure of a pdw state can be most directly probed using bragg scattering , similar to the x - ray diffraction of a crystal structure of a solid .    to further test this picture , we plotted in fig .",

    "while the pair dispersion remains positive in the @xmath11 plane , the two dimensionality destroys the long range superfluid order , leading to a metallic ground state with a density wave of cooper pairs in the @xmath8 direction .",

    "this may be regarded as a topological transition @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy in the pair mass is a consequence of the ddi .",
    "we emphasize that the re - entrant behavior of @xmath2 is robust against changes of @xmath146 and independent of the regularization scheme , because @xmath146 does not modify the long range part of the ddi .",
    "it is also present in the next leading order , @xmath147-wave channel .",
    "note that when @xmath17 changes sign , the pairing gap @xmath148 is rather large ( of the order @xmath149 ) .",
    "there exists an extended range of low @xmath150 , where @xmath17 , @xmath148 and @xmath131 remain essentially constant , so that the pdw state is rather insensitive to @xmath9 in this temperature range .    for @xmath37-wave pairing as in the cuprates , @xmath2 vanishes at a lower critical doping concentration , for which the calculated effective pair mass diverges as well .",
