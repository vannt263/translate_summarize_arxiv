    "transverse lattice gauge theory @xcite is a promising approach for ab - initio calculations of the hadronic light - cone wavefunctions .",
    "all successful calculations so far have been performed on coarse transverse lattices with effective ` colour - dielectric ' degrees of freedom , keeping the longitudinal coordinates @xmath2 continuous .",
    "although this has required some parameters in the effective hamiltonian to be fit phenomenologically , it has the great computational advantages that hadrons are dominated by states containing few partons and there is a clean separation between the longitudinal and transverse dynamics .",
    "in fact , in this case , it is not much harder to analyse the dependence of wavefunctions on the longitudinal coordinates than in @xmath3-dimensional gauge theories . while the full wavefunction of a boundstate typically requires  even in 1 + 1 dimensions  a numerical solution , the behaviour when parton lightcone momenta @xmath4 vanish can be largely understood analytically .",
    "the prototype example is @xmath3-dimensional large-@xmath1 qcd @xcite , where the behaviour of the meson wavefunction for vanishing quark @xmath4 was found exactly .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed to some extent even in @xmath5-dimensional large-@xmath1 qcd @xcite .",
    "the key strategy in all cases is to demand cancellation of singularities in the lightcone boundstate schrodinger equation when parton lightcone momenta vanish .",
    "typically , wavefunctions do not simply vanish in this high free - energy limit , as they would at large transverse momentum . rather , there occur ` ladder ' relations between states with different numbers of partons that couple the analytic structure of the infinite tower of lightcone wavefunctions .    in this paper",
    ", we analyse in a similar vein the corresponding lightcone boundstate schrodinger equation for coarse transverse lattice gauge theory at large-@xmath1 . by demanding finiteness of the boundstate energy",
    ", we determine the form of meson wavefunctions at small lightcone momentum .",
    "these depend on two exponents , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , whose values are independent of all details of the wavefunctions , which encode the leading non - analytic behaviour . in general , naive intuition based on",
    "the free lightcone kinetic energy is wrong . in particular , wavefunctions become more singular as more momenta vanish .",
    "quark distributions diverge as @xmath8 and all fock sectors contribute as @xmath9 .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the colour - dielectric formulation of transverse lattice gauge theory and set up the boundstate schrodinger equation to lowest non - trivial order of the colour - dielectric expansion that is used in the following two sections .",
    "sections  [ onelink ] and [ analytic ] determine systematically the behaviour of lightcone wavefunctions of mesons at small parton lightcone momentum . at first ,",
    "in section  [ onelink ] , we use the approximation where up to one gauge link - variable is allowed in a state .",
    "then , in section  [ analytic ] , we relax this approximation and generalise many of the results , giving a simple ansatz that incorporates all the boundary conditions . applications of the results to the behaviour of quark generalised parton distributions are given in section  [ appl ] and conclusions are discussed in section  [ last ] .",
    "we introduce continuum light - cone co - ordinates @xmath10 and discretize the transverse coordinates @xmath11 on a square lattice of spacing @xmath12 .",
    "lorentz indices @xmath13 are split into light - cone indices @xmath14 and transverse indices @xmath15 .",
    "quark fields @xmath16 in the fundamental representation and longitudinal gauge potentials @xmath17 in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath18 are associated to the sites of the transverse lattice .",
    "flux link fields @xmath19 , which we choose to be in a complex matrix representation of @xmath18 , are associated with the directed link from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a unit vector in direction @xmath23 . in the transverse continuum limit @xmath24",
    ", these would be related to transverse gauge potentials @xmath25 .",
    "subsequent analysis is done to leading order of the @xmath26 expansion , which allows one to drop the site argument @xmath20 of the fields @xcite .      for finite transverse lattice spacing @xmath12",
    ", the lagrangian may contain any operator invariant under transverse lattice gauge symmetries , poincar symmetries manifestly preserved by the lattice cut - off , and renormalisable by dimensional counting with respect to the continuum co - ordinates @xmath27 .",
    "one may control the subsequent proliferation of operators either by approaching the transverse continuum limit , in which case only renormalisable operators with respect to co - ordinates @xmath20 survive , or by ` strong - coupling ' methods on a coarse lattice , such as the colour - dielectric expansion @xcite . all calculations to date have used the colour - dielectric form @xcite and it is this approach that we analyse here .",
    "this involves fixing to the light - cone gauge @xmath28 , classically eliminating non - dynamical fields @xmath29 , @xmath30 , then expanding the resulting lightcone hamiltonian in powers of the remaining dynamical fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "truncation of such an expansion is a valid approximation provided wavefunctions of interest ( typically those of the lightest eigenstates ) are dominated by few - body fock states .",
    "this is achieved by the choice of sufficiently large masses for the dynamical fields .",
    "when the remaining couplings in the truncated hamiltonian are tuned to optimise symmetries broken by the lattice cutoff , the choice of large masses corresponds to choice of a coarse lattice spacing @xmath12 .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath33 we consider , which was previously investigated in ref .",

    "unfortunately , we are not able to explore the region @xmath214 with the strict large-@xmath1 wavefunctions . that region is governed by their @xmath26 corrections , since it depends upon quark pair production .",
    "however , we find from eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) that @xmath207 contributes zero , while @xmath215 and @xmath157 contribute finite constants to @xmath206 as @xmath216 from above , provided @xmath217 .",
    "this is presumably true for higher @xmath152 also and , provided these constants fall sufficiently rapidly with @xmath152 , suggests that @xmath218 is finite .",
    "by demanding finiteness of the boundstate energy , we have determined the form ( [ ansatz ] ) of meson wavefunctions at small lightcone momentum in a coarse transverse lattice gauge theory at large @xmath1 .",
    "the forms depend on two exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 , independent of the other details of the wavefunction such as spin and number of partons , which encode the leading non - analytic behaviour .",
    "as more momenta vanish , wavefunctions become more singular , contrary to the naive intuition from free lightcone kinetic energy , which diverges in these limits .",
    "the analytic forms lead to predictions for the behaviour near their endpoints of quark distributions .",
    "in particular , we see regge behaviour at small @xmath0 and contributions from all fock states at large @xmath0 .    the use of coarse lattice wavefunctions in transverse position space simplified the analysis , allowing us to separate the lightcone momentum problem from the transverse structure .",
    "the large-@xmath1 limit also aided us by restricting the diagrammatic rules to planar ones and suppressing quark pair production .",
    "we would need to reformulate the problem at finite @xmath1 in order to study the small lightcone momentum behaviour in baryons and in the sea quark part of wavefunctions .",
    "there is also the question of higher orders of the colour - dieletric expansion ; that is , higher powers of dynamical quark and link fields in the lightcone hamiltonian .",
    "we have investigated some of these possible terms , but found none that altered the form ( [ ansatz ] ) , although the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are affected .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to investigate similar questions in continuum lightcone qcd .",
