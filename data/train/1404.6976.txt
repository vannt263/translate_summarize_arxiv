    "the successful comparison of hydrodynamical models to a wide range of data from heavy ion collisions suggests that the produced quark - gluon fluid is a viscous fluid with perhaps the lowest known viscosity to entropy density ratio ( @xmath0 ) in nature .",
    "the low values of @xmath0 , coupled with the fact that these hydrodynamical models employ an equation of state , appear to indicate that the matter is thermal , or at least nearly isotropic , with the ratio of the longitudinal pressure to the transverse pressure close to unity .",
    "further , to reproduce key features of the data , it appears important that hydrodynamics be applicable at very early times of less than a fermi after the collision .",
    "there is some elasticity to the above conclusions , and it is conceivable that the hydrodynamic paradigm may be modified .",
    "nevertheless , the phenomenology is sufficiently robust to approach seriously . from a theoretical perspective , at first glance",
    ", it seems astonishing that hydrodynamics is applicable at all to such small systems , and at such early times .",
    "hydrodynamics is an excellent effective field theory of qcd , but for long wavelength modes and at late times  @xcite . in kinetic theory frameworks ,",
    "the scattering rates of quarks and gluons have to be sufficiently strong to counter the rapid longitudinal expansion of the system .",
    "this appears challenging . from these elementary , and perhaps naive considerations , to paraphrase a quote by wigner in another context , hydrodynamics is  unreasonably effective \" .",
    "a weak link in hydrodynamic models is the statement that the system isotropizes / thermalizes at very early times .",
    "most hydrodynamic models choose an initial time @xmath1 fm .",
    "nearly all these models ignore the pre - equilibrium dynamics prior to this time .",
    "the one model that does incorporate pre - equilibrium dynamics , the ip - glasma model , does so imperfectly  @xcite .",
    "there is therefore a practical problem of how and when pre - equilibrium dynamics can be matched on to a hydrodynamic description .",
    "this of course is tied to resolving the more general conceptual problem of how thermalization occurs in qcd .",
    "the latter will be one of the two subjects of the discussion here .    even if thermalization does occur in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "as the hydrodynamic models suggest , there is the interesting question of whether this framework is applicable to smaller size systems .",
    "how and where does hydrodynamics break down ?",
    "does it apply to p+a and p+p collisions , as some interpretations of data ( on long range rapidity correlations ) in these collisions suggest ?",
    "if it works for high multiplicities , at what multiplicities do we see an onset of hydrodynamic behavior ?",
    "are there alternative explanations for what is seen in the data ?",
    "the interpretation of long range rapidity correlations in p+p and p+a collisions will be the other topic discussed here .",
    "both topics will be discussed within weak coupling frameworks here .",
    "it is a common misunderstanding that weak coupling implies weakly interacting .",
    "that is not the case for systems with high occupancy .",
    "it is a legitimate question to ask whether weak coupling is the right framework for heavy ion collisions  at rhic and lhc , the coupling is not particularly weak . at one level , an answer is that this is the only framework we know how to compute in systematically and reliably . but",
    "this answer is also profoundly unsatisfying .",
    "a better answer is that weak coupling frameworks describe many non - trivial features of heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is however not a universal panacea , which disappoints some people , but that ca nt be helped  until some smart person solves qcd .",
    "the lack of a satisfactory framework to address dynamical aspects of qcd in strong coupling is a powerful motivation for ads / cft duality inspired frameworks .",
    "the questions regarding the applicability of these methods to heavy ion collisions are well known , and i will not revisit them here . the next section will discuss the problem of thermalization in weak coupling .",
    "we will then discuss the recent results from p+p and p+a collisions on collimated long range rapidity correlations (  the ridge \" ) .",
    "since many of the issues discussed are open , and are the subject of much debate , conclusions may be premature .",

    ", it is essential to perform ` apples - to - apples ' comparisons of data in very different centrality classes in a+a and p+a that correspond to the same @xmath144 .",
    "very recently , we performed a comprehensive study of single inclusive multiplicities and multiplicity distributions in p+p , p / d+a and a+a collisions within the ip - glasma framework  @xcite . with the results of this study , flow generated from the initial state configurations that generate the",
    "@xmath145% central a+a collisions can be compared directly to the flow generated from initial state configurations corresponding to @xmath146% central events in p+pb collisions .",
    "the preliminary results are consistent with the studies in @xcite that indicate that @xmath138 generated is too small to describe the data .",
    "we note however that if the spatial distribution of gluons is less uniform than that given by the ip - glasma framework , larger flow moments may be generated .",
    "this further emphasizes the sensitivity of results to assumptions about the spatial distribution of glue in rare configurations of the colliding protons and nuclei .",
    "a detailed discussion of our take on the initial state versus final state issues on the ridge in p+p , p+a and a+a collisions can be found in @xcite . here",
    "we will provide a rough sketch of our perspective on these issues . in high multiplicity events , the power counting in the cgc tells us that the underlying glasma background is azimuthally isotropic .",
    "this contribution is the leading contribution in powers of the coupling and the number of colors @xmath147 .",
    "jetty contributions are sub - leading in powers of the coupling but leading in @xmath147 .",
    "the interplay between the two , as a function of centrality and transverse momenta , determines the broad features of two particle correlations in high multiplicity events .",
    "similar conclusions , couched in the language of  sphericity \" observables , have been advanced in the pythia event generator framework  @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to the leading azimuthally isotropic and jetty contributions in the glasma , there is an intrinsic collimation in delta @xmath148 that is long range in rapidity .",
    "these arise from the so - called glasma graphs we described previously .",
    "they are leading in powers of the coupling in high multiplicity events but are sub - leading ( @xmath149 suppressed ) in the number of colors .",
    "the effect is purely a quantum interference effect , because the color structure of the graphs in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude are different .",
    "some of the glasma contributions are hanbury - brown  twiss ( hbt ) like interference contributions , but others are not  the collimation is sensitive to the detailed shape of the unintegrated gluon distributions in the protons and nuclei . in a+a collisions ,",
    "the azimuthally isotropic leading contributions to multiparticle production develop a sensitivity to the geometry of the overlap region due to final state interactions and generate the long range ridge like structure due to flow .",
    "the glasma graphs are tiny in comparison . however , when the multiplicity of the isotropic contribution is small , the intrinsic glasma contribution has the chance to peek its head out of the underlying background , a colorful diamond shining through the muck .",
    "this long range quantum correlation provides an intriguing alternative to the ubiquitous flow explanation that is applied to the small sized p+a and p+p systems .",
    "when we put together the following    * our recent results on the triangular anisotropy in this framework , * the disagreement in the ip - glasma+music model with @xmath138 and @xmath140 measured in p+a collisions , especially when contrasted to the remarkable success of the ip - glasma+music model in describing a+a collisions , * the recent hbt results from the alice collaboration showing that hbt radii in p+a collisions have the same slope in p+p and p+a collisions , in contrast to a+a collisions  @xcite ,    there is some cause for optimism that this manifestation of long range gluon ` entanglement ' will survive .",
    "in addition to further developments in theory , a wealth of data coming out in the near future will further test this picture relative to other , mostly final state , explanations .",

    "i mumbled something , and that was that  i was hired .",
    "it being 1987 , stony brook was the tower of bbal  @xcite , with gerry conducting that noisy and unruly orchestra with aplomb .",
