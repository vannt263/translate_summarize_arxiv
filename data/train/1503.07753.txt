    "the discovery of superconductivity in lafeaso @xcite and in related iron - pnictide or -chalcogenide families @xcite has attracted enormous interest to this class of materials .",
    "the parent compounds of these so - called 1111 or 122 systems are typically metallic paramagnets which undergo a tetragonal / paramagnetic to orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic phase transition upon cooling .",
    "the magnetic transition at @xmath11 often occurs at the same or a slightly lower temperature than the structural transition at @xmath1 .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath1 can be suppressed by the application of pressure or by chemical substitution giving way to superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the mutual relation between structure , magnetism and superconductivity remains a key issue in this class of superconductors .",
    "open questions are whether or not the structural transition is driven by the magnetic degrees of freedom , or vice versa , and whether magnetic or orbital fluctuations are responsible for the superconducting pairing @xcite .",
    "the two types of order are closely related by symmetry , both breaking the @xmath12 rotational symmetry of the tetragonal / paramagnetic phase , which can be associated with a so - called nematic phase @xcite .",
    "+ the iron - based superconductors all share a common structural feature , i.e. , iron arsenic / selenium layers which are separated by intermediate layers . among the various iron - arsenide and -chalcogenide families ,",
    "fese is of particular interest because of its simple structure without spacing layers @xcite .",
    "moreover , fese shows a structural phase transition at @xmath2 @xmath13 90 k , similar to that found in the related 1111- and 122-parent compounds @xcite , but , contrary to the latter systems , shows magnetic order only at high pressure @xcite .",
    "superconductivity , emerging in fese around 8k out of an orthorhombic structure @xcite , can be significantly enhanced up to @xmath14 values around 37k through the application of pressure @xcite which drives the system tetragonal @xcite .",
    "based on recent angle - resolved photoemission @xcite and nmr @xcite studies it has been proposed that , in contrast to the 122 family , where magnetic degrees of freedom have been discussed as the origin for nematicity @xcite , for fese @xmath1 is due to orbital order .",
    "these observations together with recent theoretical proposals on frustrated magnetism @xcite make fese a particularly interesting case for investigating the relation of structural and magnetic degrees of freedom and their role for superconductivity . in this work ,",
    "we use resistivity measurements under varying magnetic field and hydrostatic ( @xmath15he - gas ) pressure for studying the various phases and phase transitions in fese .",
    "high - quality single crystals of fese were synthesized by employing a vapor - transport technique as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "measurements were performed on three crystals with approximate dimensions of 2@xmath162@xmath160.2mm@xmath17 ( sample # 1 ) , 1@xmath161@xmath160.05mm@xmath17 ( sample # 2 ) , and 3.2@xmath161.2@xmath160.15mm@xmath17 ( sample # 3 ) .",
    "sample # 2 was obtained by cleaving sample # 1 after completion of a first set of experiments .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured by using a standard four - terminal @xmath18-technique with an applied current of @xmath19 = 1ma .",
    "four 25@xmath20 m gold wires were fixed with silver paste in the @xmath21 plane .",

    "measurements in magnetic fields were performed with @xmath22 aligned parallel to the @xmath21 plane and along the @xmath23 direction , respectively , and the current @xmath19 @xmath24 @xmath22 . for measurements under pressure @xmath25 800mpa a cube pressure cell ( institute of high - pressure physics , polish academy of sciences , unipress equipment division ) was used with @xmath26he as a pressure - transmitting medium .",

    "even when cooling through @xmath28(@xmath3 ) , which is accompanied by a pressure loss of about 30% , c.f.the inset to fig.[fig:2 ] , deviations from hydrostatic conditions are small .",
    "this is due to the low solidification temperature of helium , implying a small thermal expansion mismatch between sample and frozen pressure medium , and the small shear modulus of solid helium @xcite .",
    "as has been demonstrated by various groups , hydrostaticity can be an important issue in studying the properties of iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the in - plane resistance data , normalized to their value at 285k , for the single crystals # 1 and # 3 as a function of temperature . for comparison ,",
    "the figure also includes data taken on another fese crystal from the same source previously studied by kasahara _",
    "for all three crystals the resistance shows a sharp kink at temperatures 86.4k ( # 1 ) , 84.5k ( # 2 ) and 89.3k ( # 3 ) which is assigned to the structural transition at @xmath1 . upon cooling through @xmath2",
    "the resistance exhibits a well - defined change of slope at @xmath2 , such that the resistivity is larger in the low - temperature phase than the extrapolated value of the high - temperature phase .",
    "we note that this contrasts with the behavior observed at the usual sdw transition in , e.g. , clean ba-122 or 1111 compounds @xcite where the resistivity sharply decreases below @xmath2 . while the data sets for the three crystals almost collapse for @xmath7 , there is a considerable sample - to - sample variation in @xmath29(@xmath9 ) for temperatures below @xmath2",
    ". this might indicate different residual resistivity ratios rrr @xmath4 @xmath30(285k)/@xmath30(10k ) , and thus different sample qualities .",
    "however , since cooling through @xmath1 is accompanied by twinning , different twin states for these crystals together with a finite in - plane anisotropy in the resistivity ( @xmath31 vs. @xmath32 ) may also contribute to the different behaviors of @xmath29(@xmath9 ) for @xmath33 .",
    "in the inset of fig.[fig:1 ] we show the data around the superconducting transition .",
    "we find @xmath14 values ( midpoints of the transition ) of 8k for sample # 1 , 9k for sample # 3 and 10k for the crystal studied by kasahara _",
    "the data also indicate differences in the transition width @xmath34 ( 90% - 10% of the normal state resistance ) ranging between 0.85 k ( # 1 ) , 2.2 k ( # 2 ) and 1.15 k ( # 3 ) . + figure [ fig:2 ] shows the in - plane resistivity @xmath35 of sample # 1 for various pressures up to 780mpa .",

    "the following basic observations were made : ( 1 ) the structural transition temperature @xmath2 becomes significantly suppressed with increasing the pressure .",
    "( 2 ) there is a considerable pressure - induced reduction of the in - plane resistivity for @xmath7 , i.e. , in the tetragonal phase .",
    "this contrasts with a much weaker effect of hydrostatic pressure on the low - temperature normal state at @xmath8(@xmath3 ) , i.e. , in the orthorhombic phase , preceding the transition in the superconducting state . for a closer inspection of the latter aspect and for highlighting the effect of pressure on @xmath14 ,",

    "figure [ fig:3 ] demonstrates that ( 3 ) @xmath14 is monotonously raised with increasing pressure in the entire pressure range @xmath25 780mpa while the transition width remains unaffected .",
    "moreover , as will be explicated below in more detail , the data reveal ( 4 ) an extended @xmath9-linear range the slope of which does not change with pressure . + for analyzing the temperature dependence of the normal - state resistivity shown in fig.[fig:2 ] for @xmath8(@xmath3 ) , the following procedure was applied : the temperature range of interest was divided into intervals @xmath36 = @xmath37 - @xmath38 = 5k ( @xmath39 = 10k ) , in each of which the data were fitted by a linear function @xmath40(@xmath9 ) = @xmath41 + @xmath42 .",
