    "the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite has been successful in accessing certain aspects of the non - perturbative phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems . for example , it has given new insights and predicted various qualitative trends in the redistribution of spectral weight as temperature , pressure and doping are varied in optical and photomission experiments , near the mott transition .",
    "single site dmft extracts physical quantities such as the self energy from a local impurity model with a self consistent bath ( also refered to as lisa for local impurity self consistent approximation ) and by construction this approach misses the effects of short range correlations , such as the @xmath0-dependence of the self energy , which are bound to become important at low temperatures .",
    "it also does not allow the treatment of phases such as d - wave superconductivity , and hence there have been significant efforts to extend the dmft methodology@xcite .",
    "many of the elements of the dmft method can be traced back to the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite which has been very successful in disordered systems . in this context , the search for extensions of the cpa was fraught with many difficulties , and extensions of dmft should be scrutinized carefully in this light .",
    "the dmft equations , while having a similar spirit to those of cpa for determining the effective medium , are considerably more complex because they involve the solution of a quantum impurity model , which plays the role of the effecive hamiltonian for the local degrees of freedom treated in the dmft . to analyse these equations new concepts and numerous techniques have been developed over the last decade .",
    "their incorporation into cluster methods is promising but requires substantial new work .",
    "this paper is a contribution in this direction . in this paper",
    "we focus on one cluster extension of dmft , the cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft)@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate how the exact diagonalization aproach which was so successful in the context of the single site dmft@xcite , can be used in the cdmft context .",
    "we solve the self consistent cluster equations for the one dimensional hubbard and extended hubbard models using exact diagonalization of the effective underlying cluster impurity .",
    "we choose these models because of their generic nature , as well as the fact that dmft , which becomes exact in the limit of infinite coordination number@xcite , faces the worst case scenario in one dimension .",
    "furthermore in one dimension fairly reliable computations of static as well as dynamic quantities can be made using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite approach to carry out a comparative study .",
    "the exact diagonalization approach , within the single site dmft context , lead to the development of a technique inspired by renormalization group ideas which resulted in the first quantitative study of the critical properties near the mott transition@xcite .",
    "with a view towards the future , we discuss the possibility of combining renormalization group ideas and cdmft to develop a new numerical method in the spirit of the dmrg .",
    "the extended hubbard model ( ehm ) is defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath1 the first term corresponding to hopping between nearest neighbor sites and the second term to the onsite coulomb repulsion provide the competition between itineracy and localization in the regular hubbard model .",
    "the third term represents coulomb repulsion between electrons occupying nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the hamiltonian as written above with @xmath2 guarantees an insulating ground state with a filling of one electron per site .    in the following section we introduce and discuss the cdmft self consistency equations and",
    "show how they can be generalized to treat non - local coulomb interactions even in the presence of broken symmetries .",
    "in the next and subsequent sections we present results for the regular hubbard and the extended hubbard model respectively .",
    "this is followed by the conclusions and an outlook for further work .",
    "the cdmft@xcite method is a straightforward generalization of the single site dmft , in which local degrees of freedom within a cluster are treated exactly and those outside the cluster are replaced by a bath of non - interacting electrons determined self consistently .",
    "this approach , formulated with realistic studies in mind , deals in principle with overlapping cells and with clusters which are not necessarily defined in real space and could even be defined by non - orthogonal orbitals . in this paper , we ignore these complications and work with real space clusters using an orthogonal basis .",
    "it is worth pointing out , that if we apply the approach to non - interacting disordered alloys , the self consistency condition of cdmft becomes identical to that used in the molecular cpa approximation of ducastelle@xcite .",
    "this is in the same way as the self consistency condition in single site dmft becomes identical to the single site cpa and the two impurity approximation proposed by ingersent and schiller@xcite and by georges and kotliar@xcite , becomes identical to the pair cpa .",
    "however , unlike the single site case , where the transition from real space to momentum space is unambiguous , one has to be careful in interpreting the results of the cdmft equations in @xmath0-space .",
    "this is because the goal of cdmft is to obtain the best possible estimates of _ local _ quantities that live within a cluster . for this purpose",
    ", it introduces a cluster self energy .",
    "long distance properties such as the ones contained in the lattice green s function and the lattice self energy are then _ inferred _ from the cluster green s function or the cluster self energy while maintaining causality@xcite .",
    "the most economical way to arrive at the concepts of a dynamical mean field theory is via the cavity construction , which stresses the point made above , that the focus of the method is in extracting local quantities .",
    "the original lattice is divided into equal clusters of size @xmath3 .",
    "integrating out the degrees of freedom external to a chosen cluster ( labelled @xmath4 ) , we can formally write an effective action which would allow the computation of local quantities as @xmath5 } \\equiv \\frac{1}{z}\\int \\prod_{j\\neq 0,\\mu \\sigma } { \\cal d}c_{j\\mu \\sigma } ^{\\dagger } { \\cal d}c_{j\\mu \\sigma } e^{-s}.\\ ] ] here @xmath6 labels individual clusters and @xmath7 is an index labelling sites within each cluster .",
    "we can split the original action into three parts , @xmath8 where @xmath9 includes terms outside the chosen cluster ( the full action with the cluster replaced by a cavity ) , @xmath10 comprises of terms solely within the cluster and finally , @xmath11 includes those terms that couple the cluster with its environment .",
    "explicitly , in the case of the ehm , @xmath12 @xmath13 here @xmath14 includes the hopping matrix as well as the chemical potential within the zeroeth cluster and @xmath15 denotes all intercluster nearest neighbors .",
    "it is to be noted that , while the onsite coulomb interaction @xmath16 contributes only to @xmath10 , a nonlocal interaction such as the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath17 contributes to both @xmath10 as well as @xmath11 .",
    "this cavity construction is so far merely a relabelling of terms in the original action and is exact .",
    "however approximations need to be made to actually access the local properties within the cluster .",
    "we approximate the effective action of the cluster by keeping only the renormalization of the quadratic terms obtained after integrating out the degrees of freedom of the surrounding environment@xcite .",
    "notice that this approximation violates the translational symmetry of the original lattice .",
    "but this is not a problem , since the spirit of the approach is to estimate local quantities .",
    "the gaussian approximation for the effects of the environment seen by the cluster becomes exact in the limit of large coordination@xcite and therefore , our test case in one dimension constitutes the worst case scenario .",
    "the effective action for the cluster can then be approximated as , @xmath18 & = & \\int_{0}^{\\beta } d\\tau \\sum_{\\mu \\nu , \\sigma \\rho } c_{0\\mu \\sigma } ^{\\dagger } \\left [ \\hat{\\cal g}_{0}^{-1 } \\right ] _",

    "such a functional can be constructed order by order in a perturbative expansion in the hopping or the interactions while constraining the green s function to a fixed value . in practice ,",
    "sensible approximations to the exact functional are contructed by starting with the full baym - kadanoff functional @xmath29 $ ] and restricting its argument from the full green s function to the green s function defined only inside the cluster and its periodic supercell repetitions .",
    "this constraint is realized by the cluster self energy which plays the role of the lagrange multiplier@xcite .",
    "differentiation of this functional gives the cdmft equations .",
    "viewed as an approximation to the baym - kadanoff functional for the full lattice , this procedure may seem a bad approximation@xcite . however",
    ", this construction of the functional should be viewed as an approximation to the exact effective action for local quantities and cdmft uses it precisely for such a purpose .",
    "the functional approach is useful because it clarifies the level of approximation used in treating the broken symmetry state . in the case that we consider in this paper , all the hartree graphs",
    "are added to the functional ( see eq .",
    "[ hartree ] ) .",
    "the e - dmft@xcite includes additional graphs to the hartree terms , but the quality of the results presented below show that they would make a very small contribution .      for the purpose of practical implementation of the algorithm it is convenient to consider the cluster effective action to arise from a generalized impurity hamiltonian , @xmath30 here",

    "[ selfcon ] .",
    "our implementation relies on the solution of the impurity model using exact diagonalization@xcite . starting with an inital guess for the bath parameters we obtain",
    "the cluster self energy @xmath24 , and using the self consistency condition determine a new weiss field , @xmath38 . in turn",
    ", this defines a new hybridization function @xmath39 . to close the self consistency loop we project onto a finite subspace of bath size @xmath40 .",

    "although we study the cdmft equations only at zero temperature , the self consistency equations are solved on the matsubara axis .",
    "in order to highlight the differences between the single impurity ( lisa ) and cluster dynamical mean field schemes we present results obtained for the local spectral gap as a function of the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath16 . to keep the computational cost similar , we initially fix the total number of sites in the cluster and bath , @xmath44 , across schemes . the exact result for the gap",

    "for @xmath48 the gap follows the exact result , whereas for @xmath49 it reduces to values much smaller than the exact gap and approaches zero .",
    "for the range @xmath50 we observe a coexistence of the gapless and gapful phases .",
    "this transition from an insulating to a metallic phase is an artifact of the mean field approach which incorporates the physics of higher dimensions where the mott transition is indeed present . on the other hand ,",
    "cdmft compares excellently to the exact gap and an insulating solution exists through all finite values of @xmath16 , in agreement with the well known physics of the one dimensional hubbard model .",
    "we measure the half spectral gap as the point where the strength of the lowest frequency pole falls to @xmath51 of its peak height .",
    "this percentage is arrived at by requiring that the gap at strong coupling be fixed at the exact value .",
    "we also find , as expected from the cavity construction and noted recently@xcite , that in the case of cdmft , the bath only couples to sites on the boundary of the cluster , whereas for other cluster methods such as the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) all the sites in the cluster are equivalently coupled to the bath .",

    "[ g11g12 ] we compare the onsite as well as nearest neighbor green s functions on the matsubara axis to those we obtain using the dmrg method .",
    "the calculation of dynamical correlation functions within the dmrg method is carried out by using the finite size algorithm@xcite combined with the lanczos vector method@xcite .",
    "the results shown in the figures are those for chains with 18 sites and open boundary conditions .",
    "we verify that the results are close to those found by even longer chains and hence representative of the system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "to highlight the role of the bath within the cdmft method , we also overlay results obtained from exact diagonalization ( ed ) of a cluster of size @xmath47 , but without the bath .",
    "as @xmath16 decreases we expect the difference between onsite green s functions from the isolated cluster ( ed ) and the dmrg to increase , since the physics becomes less local .",
    "the contribution of the bath in cdmft therefore becomes more significant with decreasing @xmath16 and shows a systematic improvement with bath size as will be discussed later . throughout the range of @xmath16 we consider ,",
    "the imaginary part of the onsite green s function computed using cdmft matches remarkably well with the dmrg curve . on the other hand",
    "a comparison for the real part of the nearest neighbour green s function shows that the self consistent cdmft solution achieves only a marginal improvement over the ed calculation for small @xmath16 and almost none for large @xmath16 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the single impurity approach ( lisa ) performs poorly for the onsite green s function for all @xmath16 , except when @xmath16 is large . likewise , the nearest neighbor green s function computed using lisa agrees poorly with the exact result throughout the entire range in @xmath16 .",
    "an important question to address is the issue of convergence and the nature of the self consistent solution as a function of the size of the effective impurity cluster and bath allotted in each case . in order to find a satisfactory self consistent solution , we find that the size of the hilbert space allotted to the bath has to be at least comparable to that alloted to the cluster itself .",
    "for instance , clusters of size @xmath47 require a minimum bath of size @xmath53 for good convergence .",
    "even and odd clusters show qualitatively different types of solutions , as we discuss further below . in fig .",
    "[ dist ] we plot @xmath54 , a measure of the deviation of the lisa and cdmft solutions for the onsite and nearest neighbor green s function from accurate results obtained using dmrg , as a function of the bath size @xmath40 .",
    "this measure @xmath54 , is defined as the integrated absolute difference between the cdmft ( or lisa ) and dmrg green s functions .",
    "let us first discuss the results for the strong coupling case ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the onsite green s function computed using lisa compares excellently with dmrg and this continues to be so with the cdmft method .",

    "@xmath54 for the offsite green s function shows no definite trend with increasing bath size .     from left to right we show the local spectral functions for sites one through three in a cluster of size @xmath57 .",
    "the bath size is fixed at @xmath58.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    contrary to the expectations for a mean field solution , even cluster sizes ( @xmath59 ) show no explicit local spin symmetry breaking .",
    "odd clusters ( @xmath60 ) show similar behavior for small bath sizes upto @xmath61 . for larger bath sizes , @xmath62 , and large enough @xmath16 ,",
    "the behavior of the local spectral function is spin dependent as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ sdw ] for @xmath55 .",
    "odd clusters with broken symmetry are clearly inconsistent with cluster periodicty and consequently show poorer convergence .",
    "thus , for all even clusters and odd clusters with small enough bath sizes , the one dimensional character of the problem is dominant over the role of the bath and prevents the self consistency from showing explicit spin symmetry breaking . on the other hand , odd clusters ( we were able to test only the case @xmath57 ) with large @xmath16 and a sufficiently large bath show a symmetry broken solution consistent with the mean field approach .",
    "the effect of the bath for @xmath57 has an even more dramatic consequence at smaller @xmath16 .",
    "as opposed to even clusters which correctly see only an insulating solution in one dimension , we see both a metallic and an insulating solution for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in the region of coexistence , the metallic solution shows a better convergence than the insulating one .",
    "thus , the improvement gained in going from lisa to @xmath57 is that the region of coexistence moves to smaller @xmath16 s and the insulating solution is present all the way upto @xmath65 .",
    "small baths , due to the absence of enough degrees of freedom to impose a mean field character to the solution , show an insulating state throughout the range in @xmath16 . beyond @xmath57 for large enough odd clusters",
    "we expect to see only an insulating solution for all @xmath66 .",

    "this model constitutes a natural test case since the non - local nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion among different sites within the cluster can be accounted for exactly .    at half filling , for large enough @xmath16 ( strong coupling ) , the system goes through a first order transition from a spin density wave ( sdw ) to a charge density wave ( cdw ) ordered state at roughly @xmath68@xcite .",
    "we work in this regime , by fixing @xmath55 and scanning through the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath17 .",
    "the cdmft method shows a clear signature of this transition with a cluster as small as @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ g11g12v ] we report a comparison of the imaginary part of the onsite green s function and the real part of the near neighbor green s function in the sdw phase . as seen in the @xmath43 case , the comparison with dmrg is better for the former than the latter .",
    "we note that with increasing @xmath17 the offsite green s function compares better with the dmrg result .",
    "[ recdwg11],[imcdwg11 ] and [ recdwg12 ] compare the green s functions within the cdw phase . across the range in @xmath17 , the agreement with dmrg is so remarkable that only one set of curves are discernable within the figures .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ recdwg11 ] shows the real part of the onsite green s function which is zero in the sdw phase but acquires a non - zero value in the cdw phase .",
    "this indicates a breaking of local particle - hole symmetry of the system that is now conserved only on the average every two sites .",
    "notice how the curves for different values of @xmath17 cross , defining a characteristic scale approximately equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the versatility of cdmft in being able to treat the ordered phase stems from the fact that it only assumes supercell periodicity and consequently allows for complicated ordered states within a cell .",
    "this is in contrast to the dca method that assumes full periodicity of the lattice , and therefore requires a fine discretization in momentum space to adequately capture the discontinuities in the brillouin zone that appear with the emergence of short range ordered phases .",
    "schematic representation of an rg procedure intended to reach large cluster sizes.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we have shown that the cdmft method produces remarkably good results when tested in one dimensional systems .",
    "this is very encouraging , since one would expect mean field methods to perform even better as the dimensionality increases .",
    "we saw that even the smallest possible cluster size ( @xmath47 ) along with a self consistent bath of modest size allows for an accurate determination of onsite correlations , while the offsite quantities improve systematically with increasing cluster size .",
    "further , the success of our extension of the cdmft equations to describe the discrete broken symmetry of the cdw order clearly demonstrates the power of the method to incorporate short range correlations .",
    "following the example of the ehm , with the simplest kind of short range correlation , it should be possible to treat the physics of more complicated ordered phases as well as unit cells of realistic materials within the cellular mean field approach . the main obstacle in this program",
    "is the computational effort that goes into solving the self consistent equations for the large clusters required by real world applications .",
    "this calls for a systematic approach that blends together cluster dynamical mean field and renormalization group ideas@xcite to select the most relevant degrees of freedom to represent a cluster .",
    "we suggest that the cdmft approach can be used iteratively in complete analogy with the density matrix renormalization group approach .",
    "it is useful to compare the similarities and differences between these two methods . in both of them ,",
    "one improves on the exact diagonalization of a small finite size system by embedding the small system in a larger one ; an embedding which can be described by a reduced density matrix . within dmrg",
    "the density matrix is determined by an exact diagonalization of the larger system containing the subsystem of interest . in cdmft",
    ", one can approximate the density matrix by modelling the enviroment with a gaussian weiss field .",
    "the cdmft assumption of a self consistent gaussian bath as the environment , that one can integrate out exactly in order to define a reduced density matrix for the cluster , becomes more and more accurate as the dimensionality increases .",
    "this choice of bath is optimum in a dynamical mean field sense ( optimized for the computation of the local one particle green s function of the cluster ) and sidesteps the conventional dmrg procedure for building the reduced density matrix out of a few target states .",
    "further , the dmrg prescription@xcite of selecting the states for which the reduced density matrix has the largest eigenvalues allows for a truncation of the cluster hilbert space while retaining the relevant physical information . in fig .  [ cdmftrg ] we indicate schematically how such a method would proceed by doing cdmft on small clusters , truncating their hilbert space using the dmrg prescription and finally using them as building blocks of even larger clusters . this procedure can be repeated until either a desired cluster size or convergence in a certain observable of interest is reached .",
