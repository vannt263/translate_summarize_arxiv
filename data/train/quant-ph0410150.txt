    "the study of quantum computing and quantum information processing has received great attentions in the past decade@xcite . among several proposals of implementing quantum information processing in realistic physical systems ,",
    "solid state quantum computing is one of the most promising candidates for future quantum computer architecture due to its scalability .",
    "meanwhile , the idea of using spin degree of freedom in electronics@xcite has been strongly supported from recent experiments showing unusually long spin decoherence time in semiconductors . the first qc scheme based on electron spin in semiconductor qd",
    "was proposed by loss and divincenzo@xcite , in which the controlling operations are effected by gating of the tunnelling barrier between neighboring dots , and one - qubit operations by applied magnetic field .",
    "kane designed a silicon based nuclear spin quantum computer@xcite , information is encoded into the nuclear spins of donor atoms in doped silicon electronic devices .",
    "local operations on individual spins are performed using externally applied electric fields , and interaction between qubits is mediated through the donor - electron exchange interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , optical rkky interaction between charged semiconductor qds is generated via virtual excitation of delocalized excitons , and it provides an efficient coherent control of the spins .",
    "very recently , calarco et al.@xcite presented an all optical implementations of qc with semiconductor qds , where two - qubit gates are realized by switching on trion - trion coulomb interactions between different qds , state selectivity is achieved via conditional laser excitation exploring pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the idea of most existing qc schemes is to design an effective hamiltonian and then find or adjust a physical system to evolve approximately under the effective hamiltonian .",
    "any deviation from the `` beautiful '' effective hamiltonian in practical physics system will bring complexity , even disaster , to the practical qc@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we give a new qc scheme based on a more fundamental hamiltonian in solid state physics .",
    "the qubit states are selected as the spin states of an excess electron stored in a semiconductor qd .",
    "the hamiltonian of electrons in semiconductor qds dressed by an external magnetic field can be described as following @xmath0 where single - particle hamiltonian @xmath1 describes the electron dynamics confined to semiconductor qd .",
    "@xmath2 is the effective mass of electron in semiconductor qd .",
    "we allow for a local magnetic field @xmath3 applied on qd @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the confinement - potential experienced by the electron in qd .",
    "all operations in our scheme are performed on individual qds . using single - qubit rotation and adjusting gate voltage to drive electron between qds through one dimensional quantum wire , a quantum control gate",
    "can be realized naturally .",
    "the detailed descriptions on design of a cnot gate are given in sec .",
    "ii . physical implementation and a brief discussion on gate fidelity are presented in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "it is well known that single qubit and cnot gates together can be used to implement an arbitrary unitary operation , and therefore are universal for quantum computation@xcite .",
    "a single qubit is a vector @xmath6 parameterized by two complex numbers satisfying @xmath7 .",
    "operations on a qubit must preserve this norm , and thus are described by @xmath8 unitary matrices .",
    "any single qubit rotations can be realized by two of the following three rotation operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are pauli matrices .    in textbook ,",
    "a cnot operator is described by a @xmath15 matrix , @xmath16 it can be rewritten as    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is @xmath8 identity matrix .",
    "further , substituting eq .",
    "( 3 ) into @xmath19 , we have @xmath20,\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}i\\otimes i}\\cdot e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}i\\otimes \\sigma_{x}}\\cdot e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sigma_{z}\\otimes i}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(i\\otimes i+e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\cdot e^{-i\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\sigma_{z}\\otimes i}\\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}i\\otimes\\sigma_{x}}).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term at the last line of eq .",
    "( 4 ) can easily be realized by letting two qubits evolve freely under each single electron hamiltonian respectively without any operations .",
    "the second and the third terms are only single spin rotations . by the superposition of electron spin state and charge position , the fourth term in eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be implemented naturally , which will be illustrated in sec .",
    "so , only six steps(including five operations ) are required to complement a cnot quantum gate given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) . compared with the cnot gate presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is no need for spin swap operation in our scheme , and operations are performed on individual qds here . furthermore , four terms on the right side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) commute each other , we can exchange the operator sequence arbitrarily .",
    "the spin states of the excess conductor electron of qd are employed as qubits . manipulating a single spin",
    "can be done by applying a pulsed local magnetic field , two - qubit control gate in this paper is realized by a specific spacial distribution of qds . the architecture of our designed cnot gate is shown in fig .  1 , where the gray thick lines stand for one - dimension quantum wires , which are used to coherently transport electrons between qds@xcite .",
    "eight qds are needed to implement a cnot gate .",
    "initial states of two qubits(control qubit and target qubit ) are stored in spin states of the excess electron in qd @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , and final states of the two qubits are defined as the spin states of electron in qds @xmath23and @xmath24 .",
    "qds @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are all empty of electrons in the initial time .",
    "firstly , the electron is being driven from qd @xmath21 to qd @xmath25 and @xmath26 by adjusting gate voltage .",
    "the design of electric gates can refer to the principle of single electron tunnelling(set ) transistor@xcite and the flying qubit in one - dimensional quantum wires@xcite .",
    "assuming the two paths and two qds ( @xmath25 and @xmath26)are symmetric , the probabilities of electron in qd @xmath25 and @xmath26 will be equal in theory . by the same method , the electron in qd @xmath22 is also being driven into qd @xmath27 and @xmath28 in parallel .",
    "secondly , we apply an external local magnetic field along z direction on qd @xmath25 to do a spin rotation @xmath29 .",
    "thirdly , an external local magnetic field along @xmath30 direction on qd @xmath28 is used to complement operator @xmath31 .",
    "fourthly , apply two electric fields on qd @xmath25 and qd @xmath28 respectively to create a global phase difference @xmath32 between qds @xmath25 , @xmath28 and qds @xmath26 , @xmath27 . at last ,",
    "two electrons are pushed from qds @xmath25 , @xmath28 to qd @xmath23 , and from qds @xmath26 and @xmath27 to qd @xmath24 respectively .",
    "adjusting gate voltage to eliminate the case that two electrons site on qd @xmath23 or @xmath24 simultaneously . according to the coulomb blockade effect , there are only two possible pathes for the two electrons actually occur .",
    "one is @xmath33 ; @xmath34(solid arrows in fig .  1 )",
    ", the other is @xmath35 ; @xmath36(dashed arrows ) . in mathematic language",
    ", the above process can be described as following , @xmath37\\bigotimes [ \\rho_{w_3}e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sigma_{x}}|s_{x_2}\\rangle+\\rho_{w_4}|s_{x_2}\\rangle],\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the probabilities of electron in qd @xmath25 and qd @xmath26 respectively , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the probabilities of electron in qd @xmath27 and qd @xmath28 respectively .",
    "further , we expand eq .  ( 5 ) by summation of possible pathes mentioned above , only two terms are retained , @xmath42,\\nonumber\\\\ & = & [ \\rho_{w_1}\\rho_{w_3}e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}e^{-i\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\sigma_{z}\\otimes i}\\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}i\\otimes\\sigma_{x}}+\\rho_{w_2}\\rho_{w_4}i\\bigotimes i]|s_{x_1}\\rangle\\otimes|s_{x_2}\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can see that the fourth term in eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be complemented by the above architecture under the condition of equal probabilities(@xmath43 ) .",
    "two single - qubit operations ( the 2nd and 3rd terms in eq .",
    "( 4))can be performed by applied two local pulsed magnetic fields along @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions on qds @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively at the initial time .",
    "they can also be performed on qds @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the final time .",
    "the successful criterium of the above control gate is that two electrons must arrive at qds @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the final time .",
    "if qds @xmath23 and @xmath24 only process one electron at the final time(@xmath46 probability ) , then the control operation will be discarded .",
    "so , a measurement must be done at the final time to check whether the control gate has been performed successfully .",
    "if a two - qubit control gate has been done successfully , the potential quantum error of our scheme comes from the asymmetric probabilities of electron positions , namely , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "we define the fidelity of our cnot gate induced by the asymmetric probabilities of electron positions as    @xmath49    and @xmath50 where operator @xmath51 is the ideal cnot operator described by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath52 is the practical operator with the consideration of potential asymmetric probabilities of electron positions in real space . under the case of equal probabilities ( symmetric case ) , we have @xmath53 , and the fidelity is equal to @xmath54 by the definition of eq .",
    "we use @xmath55to measure the magnitude of asymmetry of electron positions , and the symmetric case corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "fidelity of the cnot gate as a function of the asymmetry in case @xmath57 is plotted in fig .",
    "it is shown , in fig .  2 , that fidelity will be up @xmath58 when the asymmetry does not exceed 10% .        under the precondition of high fidelity , a small size difference between qd @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( and between qd @xmath27 and @xmath28 )",
    "is permitted . reminding that qds @xmath25 and @xmath28 does not need the same in size . as a result",
    ", the single - qubit operations can be performed selectively with different frequencies , and the local pulsed magnetic field may also be replaced by optical operations , and the single qubit rotations can be proceeded by applying two laser fields which exactly satisfy the raman - resonance condition between spin - up state and spin - down state@xcite@xcite",
    ". optical operation will sufficiently reduce single - qubit operation time .",
    "+ operation time and decoherence time are critical criteria on the feasibility of a qc scheme@xcite . for a single spin flip rotation , a switching time of @xmath59",
    "is required , using a magnetic field of @xmath60@xcite .",
    "considering the switching on / off time of electric field is about @xmath61 , gate voltage must be adjusted carefully to create a small potential difference between qds @xmath62 , and qds @xmath63@xcite .",
    "if two pulsed lasers are used to complement a single qubit operation , the single spin flip operation time is about ten picoseconds for a given coupling constant between laser and qd @xmath64 .",
    "decoherence time of spin states in semiconductor qd has also been extensively studied in theory and experiment@xcite@xcite , and coherent transport of spin charge in semiconductor has been discussed in detail .",
    "state initialization and read - out can be implemented using spin filters and polarizers in any designs@xcite@xcite .",
    "our motivation is to show a new theoretical design direction on quantum control gate based on semiconductor qds .",
    "so , we do not focus more attentions on challenges common to all other implementations in electron spins and qds system .",
    "the great challenge to our scheme , which is different from other schemes in practical , is how to manipulate single electron transport coherently between qds through one - dimensional quantum wire or nanotube , this difficulty can be solved by the rapid development of single electron tunnelling transistor technologies .",
    "in summary , we have presented a new qc scheme based on semiconductor qds system .",
    "the superposition of spin state and charge position in real space and coulomb blockade effect are introduced to design a cnot gate .",
    "all the quantum states evolutions in our scheme base on a more fundamental hamiltonian . no direct spin - spin coupling is needed here .",
    "our scheme , which is based on solid state qd , is essentially different from the mobile qubit scheme@xcite , and spin state operations are more stable in general . as we know , it is the first time that a control gate is designed by the superposition of electron spin state and charge position in quantum computation based on qds system .",
    "our scheme is simple except for a dedicated circuit and more qds needed .",
    "furthermore , our scheme can safely be extended into the charge qubit case by replacing each qd with a coupled qds , and qubit states are defined as the excess electron charge states in coupled qds .",
