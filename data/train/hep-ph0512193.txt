    "so @xmath149 is significantly smaller than @xmath148 and it falls off rapidly with @xmath139 as is seen in the figure .",

    "we see that @xmath163 increases rapidly with @xmath139 ( below the new physics scale @xmath11 ) , and it becomes larger than the sm cross section @xmath164 at high energies .",
    "therefore the signal cross section @xmath165 is large and increases very rapidly with @xmath139 .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ + + ttll ] that there is destructive interference between the sm amplitude and that of @xmath166 .",

    "however , in the energy region below 1.5 tev , the signal @xmath173 is still smaller than the background @xmath148 .",
    "in addition to @xmath148 considered above , there is also sm backgrounds @xmath174 from @xmath175 collisions , which are comparable to the @xmath148 @xcite . over all",
    ", we see that the sm background is substantially larger than the signal except at very high energies .",
    "thus we need to develop suitable kinematic cuts to suppress the sm backgrounds , as we discuss next .",
