    "in history , the motivation for modifying gr ( general relativity ) mainly comes from the fact that gr is not renormalizable .",
    "so it can not be conventionally quantized . in the first place , utiyama and dewitt showed that the renormalization at one - loop requires the higher order curvature terms in the action of gravity theories @xcite . secondly , stelle showed the corresponding gravity theories with these higher order terms are indeed renormalizable @xcite .",
    "finally , when quantum effects or string theory are taken into account , the effective low energy gravitational action also requires higher order curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "so it was generally believed that the modifications to gr would be important only at the scales of very close to the planck lengthy or planck energy .",
    "consequently , both the big - bang singularity and black hole singularity are expected to be absent in the modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "this is the belief before 1998 .",
    "however , with the discovery of cosmic acceleration in 1998 @xcite , one realize that gr may also need to be modified on very large scale or at very low energy ( or very weak gravitational field ) .",
    "these constitute the infrared modifications to gr , for example , the gdp ( dvali - gabadadze - porrati ) model @xcite , the @xmath0 modified gravity model @xcite and so on . here",
    "we shall not produce an exhaustive list of references on modified gravity , but we prefer the readers to read the nice review paper by sotiriou and faraoni @xcite and the references  therein . in general , the equations of motion for the generalized modified gravity are of fourth order and one can expect the particle content of the theory would have eight degrees of freedom : two for the massless graviton , one in a scalar excitation and five in a ghost - like massive spin two field @xcite .",
    "the presence of ghost leads one to accept unphysical negative energy states in the theory and the property of unitarity is lost @xcite .",
    "this ghost problem is closely related to the higher order property of the theories .",
    "so the purpose of this paper is to seek for the _ second order _ theories of gravity , at least in the background of spatially flat frw ( friedmann - robertson - walker ) universe . except for satisfying the requirement of second - order",
    ", the theories also meet ghost free conditions . due to the property of second order of acceleration equation ,",
    "the resulting friedmann equation remains first order and the cosmic evolution of the universe is easily deal with .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the generalized modified gravity theories .",
    "the equations of motion are presented . in section iii , we propose the lagrangian for the generalized modified gravity which are both ghost free and second order ( in the background of spatially flat frw universe ) . in section iv , we investigate the cosmic evolution of some specific models of lagrangian . in section",
    "v , we investigate the weak field limit of these models .",
    "section iv gives the conclusion and discussion .",
    "we shall use the system of units in which @xmath1 and the metric signature @xmath2 throughout the paper .",
    "the generalized modified gravity theories have the action of the form @xcite @xmath3+\\mathscr{l}_{m}\\right\\}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a general function of the ricci scalar @xmath5 and two curvature invariants , @xmath6 which are of lowest mass dimension and parity - conserving .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the ricci tensor and the riemann tensor , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the lagrangian density for matters .",
    "if we define    @xmath10    then we obtain the generalized einstein equations @xcite    @xmath11   + \\nabla^2\\left(f_{p}r_{\\mu\\nu}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\&&+g_{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_{\\lambda}\\nabla_{\\sigma}\\left(f_pr^{\\lambda\\sigma}\\right )   -4\\nabla_{\\lambda}\\nabla_{\\sigma}\\left[f_qr^{\\lambda \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\sigma}_{\\ \\",

    "so eqs .  ( [ einstein ] )",
    "are usually a set of fourth - order differential equations except for the case of a cosmological constant @xmath15 .",
    "the existence of higher derivatives in the equation of motions suggests that one would always find ghosts in a linearized analysis .",
    "actually , it can be argued by considering the cauchy problem , the gauge symmetries and constraints on the theory ( see for instance @xcite ) that the generalized modified gravity will contain at most eight degrees of freedom : two for the usual massless graviton , one for a scalar field and five for ghost - like massive spin two excitation .",
    "the ghost problem leads one to accept negative energy states in the theory .",
    "so the property of unitarity is lost @xcite .",
    "however , comelli @xcite , navarro and acoleyen @xcite showed that with a suitable choice of parameters , the theory would be ghost - free .",
    "actually , they showed that the general lagrangian of the form @xmath16 are ghost free .",
    "so in this case it is left with only an extra scalar degree of freedom to the gravitational sector . in the next section",
    ", we shall seek for the lagrangian which gives the acceleration equation of second order derivative and the corresponding theories are ghost free .",
    "the spatially flat frw metric is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scale factor . given the metric , we could calculate the ricci scalar @xmath5 and the curvature invariants , @xmath19 , @xmath20\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ q&=&12\\left[\\left(\\dot{h}+h^2\\right)^2+h^4\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the hubble parameter and dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath22 .",
    "the second derivative of the scale factor , @xmath23 ( in @xmath24 ) , is present in @xmath25 . if @xmath26 , the corresponding equations of motion are the einstein equations .",
    "they are second - order differential equations . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath24 appears linearly in the lagrangian .",
    "however , if @xmath24 appears nonlinearly in the lagrangian just as contributed by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the corresponding equations of motion would be fourth - order differential equations .",
    "it is not hard to conjecture that , if we are able to make @xmath24 disappear in the lagrangian @xmath4 such that it is uniquely the function of hubble parameter @xmath29 , the resulting equation of motion must be of second - order differential equation . then how to make @xmath24 disappear ?",
    "we can examine the proper combination of @xmath30 .    to this end ,",
    "let us calculate @xmath31 so if we let @xmath32 namely , @xmath33 we would obtain    @xmath34    is @xmath24 negative or positive ? in order to answer this question , let us resort to the einstein equation in frw universe @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the total cosmic energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "it is apparent @xmath24 is nonpositive in the history of the universe which mainly covers three epochs dominated by radiation , matter and cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath37 in the following .",
    "thus @xmath38 it is apparent @xmath39 and @xmath40 should obey @xmath41 if we define @xmath42 as follows @xmath43 then we have @xmath44 in the background of frw universe .",
    "now we could conclude that , for the general function of @xmath45 , the lagrangian density @xmath46+\\mathscr{l}_m\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] always leads to the second order equation of motion in the background of spatially flat frw universe .",
    "of course , we have assumed the energy - momentum tensor contributed by the matters is up to second - order .    in general",
    ", the above theories of gravity would contain the massive spin two ghost field in addition to the usual massless graviton and the massive scalar @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath47 theories of gravity are found to be ghost free .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the models given by @xmath48\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are also ghost free . in view of this point",

    "but it is not the case for other spacetimes .",
    "here we would like to point out that the above conclusion is valid only for four dimensional frw universe . if the dimension of spacetime is greater than four , the variation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : llllll ] ) would lead to a fourth order acceleration equation .",
    "the reason could be understood as follows . in the gauss - bonnet gravity ,",
    "if the dimension of spacetime is four , the gauss - bonnet term turns out to be a topological invariant and so it makes no contribution to the equation of motion . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the gauss - bonnet term is not a topologically invariant and so it would contribute to the equation of motion . for the modified gauss - bonnet gravity ,",
    "the equation of motion is usually fourth order even in the four dimensions .",
    "actually , the gauss - bonnet term is generalized in the lovelock gravity theory @xcite .",
    "it is found that the equations of motion in lovelock gravity are of second order in any spacetime with any dimensions , needless to say in the background of four dimensional frw universe .",
    "however , there is a notable difference between the lovelock gravity and the generalized modified gravity in eq .",

    "we could obtain the friedmann equation from the energy - conservation equation    @xmath61    as follows @xmath62 the left hand side of the friedmann equation is only the function of hubble parameter .",
