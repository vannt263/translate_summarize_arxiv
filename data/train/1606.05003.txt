    "moreover , there is only small scatter about this relation , as confirmed by @xcite .",

    "early - type galaxies ( ellipticals and lenticulars ) , due to their lower hi gas content , do not suffer from this problem , however they lack an easy to measure tracer .",
    "for this reason , studies addressing the mda relation in early - type galaxies have had to largely rely on other tracers such as hot x - ray emitting gas or discrete tracers like planetary nebulae ( pne ) , globular clusters ( gc ) , and satellite galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; see however @xcite ) .",
    "while theoretical efforts trying to reproduce the mda relation in the @xmath3cdm context are progressing ( e.g.  @xcite ) , it is desirable to push the observational side further , and probe the mda relation systematically for a sample of early - type galaxies down to low accelerations .",
    "+ alternatively , the mda relation , and its tightness , have been used to argue in favour of a modification of newtonian dynamics ( mond ; see , e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "this represents the first homogeneous , statistically meaningful sample of stellar kinematics of early - type galaxies ( all of which are fast rotators as defined in @xcite ) reaching radii where dark matter is expected to dominate the mass budget ( i.e. the dark matter fraction increases from @xmath11/3 to @xmath12/3 when measured within 2 and 4 @xmath5 , respectively ) .",
    "here we use s mass modelling results to test whether or not early - type galaxies follow the mda relation .",

    "finally , we also consider results from mass modelling based on gc kinematics for an extended sample , including slow rotators and reaching even larger radii , also from the sluggs survey @xcite .",
    "our primary sample comprises 14 early - type galaxies in a stellar mass range of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "mass models for these galaxies were built by using axisymmetric jeans anisotropic modelling ( jam ; @xcite ) with a stellar and a dark matter component . to ensure the method to be applicable , and to achieve a homogenous sample of nearly axisymmetric galaxies , restricted the sample to fast rotators .",
    "one input to the jam modelling is the light distributions in these galaxies .",
    "those were parametrized using multi - gaussian expansions ( mge ; ) and were taken from various studies ( @xcite ; ) . here",

    "other galaxy parameters , such as half - light radius and distance , are taken from , and the velocity dispersion within @xmath7 from @xcite and for ngc  3115 .",
    "the combination of data from atlas@xmath0 @xcite and sluggs @xcite allowed to probe the stellar dynamics of the galaxies from their inner parts out to a median radius of @xmath14@xmath8 .",
    "the stellar kinematics were extracted in the optical ( atlas@xmath0 ; @xcite ) and ca triplet spectral region ( sluggs ; @xcite ) , in both cases with ppxf @xcite .",
    "for the dynamical modelling the data were symmetrized , outliers were removed , and the two data sets combined .",

    "the jam models are very accurate and robust , which was confirmed by comparison with the results of @xcite based on hi data , but despite the increase in radial extent when compared to similar earlier studies , they probe the dynamics to accelerations an order of magnitude higher than those typically probed in spiral galaxies .",

    "@xcite analysed the dependence of their mass estimates on these assumptions , took into account corrections for non - sphericity and substructures in the tracer population , and compared their results to previous studies .",

    "most of the galaxies have rich enough gc data sets to derive not only a single dynamical mass estimate , but also radial mass density profiles .",

    "this becomes especially evident when considering the residual profiles in the right panel , which are calculated individually for each monte carlo representation .",
    "the general reproduction of the mda and the slopes of the density profile by mond is intriguing at first .",
    "we note that this is achieved without fitting for the mond acceleration scale , but using for all galaxies a value of @xmath42 m s@xmath30 , which was found by @xcite for spiral galaxies , and which is still used in more recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sensitivity to the exact value is not very critical , as can be seen in the comparison curve in the mda relation for another value @xmath43 m s@xmath30 , which was also used for spiral galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    ". however , the opposite is true for the comparison sample of spirals from @xcite , for which the standard interpolating function provides a superior representation .",
    "this is at odds with mond , where there should be one universal interpolating function and mda relation .",
    "the above is consistent with @xcite s ( @xcite ) results from stellar dynamics .",
    "they concluded that , from their analysis of the mda for a sample of early - type galaxies , the upturn of the mda relation occurs at higher accelerations than for spiral galaxies , in disagreement with mond ( when using accelerations @xmath45 based on the dynamics as in their fig .",

    "their sample included two of our galaxies and also slow rotators .",
    "at that time , @xcite doubted that the change in the mass - to - light ratios , which is what @xcite actually plotted , marked the onset of the mass discrepancy , and pointed out discrepancies between the results of @xcite and the profiles of @xcite for the galaxies common to both studies .",
    "even with the combination of stellar kinematics from atlas@xmath11 and sluggs surveys we only reach radii at which dark matter just starts to be dominant  and where the accelerations just decrease to values of the order of the mond constant @xmath44 . using gc kinematics from the sluggs survey , @xcite studied dynamical models for a superset of galaxies reaching beyond @xmath46 .",

    "previous studies with dynamical tracers concluded that ngc  821 is mondian to @xmath13.5 @xmath4 , using pne @xcite , while could not reconcile ngc  3115 with mond , similar to our analysis .",
    "the same applies to ngc  4278 , which is in our analysis only marginally inconsistent .    for the mda relation , adding the @xcite data is problematic , since their profiles are non - monotonic and ` jumpy ' , again due to the discrete nature of the tracers .",
    "instead , we use the total masses and dark matter fractions at 5 @xmath4 and at @xmath47 from their table a4 .",

    "while these tentative gc based conclusions do not share the robustness of those based on the jam models ( which were reinforced by @xcite ) , they suggest an interesting trend of increasing offsets in the mda relation from spiral galaxies to fast rotators to slow rotators . in the framework of mond",
