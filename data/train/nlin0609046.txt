    "hypotheses of strong chaos are keystone requisites for both basic theories ( statistical mechanics  @xcite ) and computation methods ( transport properties  @xcite , elimination of chaotic variables  @xcite ) . in all cases , the hypotheses of strong chaos consist essentially of two main assumptions about the ( high - dimensional hamiltonian ) dynamics : ( i ) ergodicity , i.e. , the existence of a single chaotic component and negligible measure of the regions of quasi - periodic motion ; and ( ii ) strong mixing ( exponential decay of correlations ) .",
    "generic low - dimensional hamiltonian systems violate both hypotheses since the chaotic trajectories stick to the border of islands of regular motion introducing long - term correlations in the dynamics  @xcite .    for many higher - dimensional systems",

    "however , the vanishing measure of regular regions [ hypothesis ( i ) ] does not guarantee the fast decay of correlations [ hypothesis ( ii ) ] .",
    "the breakdown of hypothesis ( ii ) occurs due to the trapping ( stickiness ) of chaotic trajectories around non - hyperbolic structures in the phase - space , and even zero measure sets ( e.g. , the bouncing ball orbits in the bunimovich stadium billiard ) can be responsible for the anomalous decay of correlations  @xcite .",

    "this system typically has invariant tori , but hypothesis ( i ) is satisfied for large  @xmath0 in the sense mentioned above ( our results do not apply when regular behavior prevails for  @xmath5  @xcite ) . for weak coupling",
    "we observe an intermediate regime of enhanced trapping which we show to exist also for area - preserving maps perturbed by noise .",
    "asymptotically , our numerical results show that the trapping decreases with  @xmath0 indicating the effective validity of hypothesis  ( ii ) for high - dimensional hamiltonian systems composed of coupled low - dimensional ones .",

    "the noise has two qualitatively different effects : while ( r3 ) represents the typical cut - off of the power - law distribution  @xcite , during the novel regime ( r2 ) the noise acts constructively ( increasing the regularity of the dynamics ) by allowing trajectories to penetrate regular islands .",

    "all our numerical simulations for @xmath65 are consistent with the assumption that these are the only existent tori , in agreement with a more general picture of hamiltonian systems : exponential decay of the measure of the tori with  @xmath0 ( @xmath66 for  @xmath67 ) and nonexistence of tori of dimension smaller than  @xmath0  `` froeschl conjecture ''  @xcite .",
