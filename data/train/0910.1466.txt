    "many studies over the past decade have presented strong evidence for the coevolution of black holes and galaxies based on samples dominated by the low - density field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is interesting to determine if similar coevolution between agn and galaxies is present in groups and clusters because the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution , such as the available cold gas to fuel star formation and black hole growth , are substantially different from the field .",
    "in addition , agn in groups and clusters at low - redshift appear to play the critical role in maintaining the temperature of their hot atmospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , while agn heating at the epoch of cluster assembly remains a viable explanation for the minimum entropy level in the intracluster medium .",
    "these questions have motivated my collaborators and i to systematically search for agn in groups and clusters of galaxies and led to the discovery of large numbers of agn in these dense environments in the local universe @xcite . in this contribution",
    "i summarize some recently published work on the evolution of agn in clusters of galaxies @xcite and present a new , preliminary analysis of the evolution of agn in the lower - density group environment .",
    "i conclude with a brief discussion of several future directions .",
    "the key requirement to measure the evolution of agn in groups and clusters , as well as perform quantitative comparisons to their galaxy populations , is systematic and unbiased selection .",
    "we select agn with x - ray observations obtained by the _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ satellites because x - ray emission provides a relatively unbiased measure of accretion for luminous objects .",
    "redshifts of the counterparts to the x - ray sources , obtained from our work or the literature @xcite , are then used to identify the subset of x - ray sources associated with the groups and clusters .",
    "our final sample includes 17 clusters with @xmath1 and 15 clusters with @xmath2 that are reasonably well - matched in spite of their heterogeneous selection based on available archival data .",
    "we systematically characterize the agn population via the agn fraction , which is defined as the fraction of all galaxies brighter than some absolute magnitude that host agn above some luminosity threshold .",
    "given the sensitivity limits of x - ray data and multi - object spectroscopy , the agn fraction in clusters is defined here as the fraction of galaxies brighter than @xmath3 that host agn with hard x - ray [ 2 - 10 kev ] luminosities above @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 . while redshift measurements are nearly complete for the x - ray sources , this is not always the case for the entire galaxy population of the group or cluster .",
    "in many cases the number of galaxies above the luminosity threshold is estimated from the velocity dispersion and an empirical relation derived from the sdss @xcite . throughout this work",
    "the agn fraction is only measured for agn and other galaxies that fall within the projected @xmath6 radius , that is the radius within which the group or cluster is a factor of 200 overdensity .",
    "further details are provided in @xcite .",
    "the main result of this analysis is presented in the figure , which demonstrates that the cluster agn fraction increases by a factor of eight from the present to @xmath0 .",
    "this evolution is based on 2 luminous agn in 17 clusters at @xmath1 and 17 luminous agn in 15 clusters at @xmath7 .",
    "this dramatic evolution is similar to the evolution of the star - forming galaxy population in clusters known as the butcher - oemler effect @xcite .",
    "here we have parametrized the agn evolution as @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( _ dashed line _ in the figure ) .",
    "this power - law index is consistent with the value of @xmath10 recently measured for star - forming galaxies from mid - infrared observations @xcite and supports the hypothesis that black holes and galaxies coevolve in dense environments .",
    "to @xmath11 from a sample 17 clusters at @xmath1 and 15 clusters at @xmath7 ( _ filled circles _ ) .",
    "these points represent the average fraction of cluster members more luminous than @xmath3 that host agn more luminous than @xmath12 erg / s .",
    "the increase in the agn fraction is consistent with a power - law of the form @xmath13 ( _ dashed line _ ) and is approximately an order of magnitude below the field agn fraction ( _ open symbols _ ) over this redshift range .",
    "a preliminary estimate of the group agn fraction suggests their rate of evolution is similar ( _ gray triangle _ at @xmath14 and _ upper limit _ at @xmath15 ) .",
    "the group agn fraction is defined as the fraction of @xmath16 erg / s agn in galaxies with @xmath17 mag ( see _ right - hand axis _",
    "label ) . ]",
    "the rate of evolution of the agn fraction also appears similar to the lower - density field ( _ open symbols _ ) , although the cluster agn fraction is approximately an order - of - magnitude lower over the entire redshift range .",
    "the lower agn fraction in clusters relative to the field strongly suggests that there must be a substantial change in the agn fraction in the intermediate - density group environment .",
    "observations of high - redshift groups find a substantial decrease in the agn fraction with increasing overdensity at @xmath0 @xcite and a measured group agn fraction of @xmath18% for agn with broad - band x - ray luminosities @xmath19 erg s@xmath5 in galaxies more luminous than @xmath17 mag ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ gray triangle _ in figure ) .",
    "studies of low - redshift groups find that the agn fraction is somewhat higher but consistent with the value measured in clusters @xcite ; however , the group sample contains far fewer galaxies and provides only an upper limit on agn as luminous as those in the high - redshift sample ( the _ arrow _ at @xmath15 in the figure represents the 90% confidence limit on the group agn fraction ) .",
    "the observations summarized here have shown that the agn fraction in clusters increases by approximately an order of magnitude from the present to @xmath0 .",
    "this evolution is also quantitatively similar to the evolution of the star - forming galaxy fraction in clusters , which suggests that cluster galaxies and their central black holes also coevolve , although at a different rate from their counterparts in the field .",
    "a simple comparison between the agn fraction in clusters and the field indicates that the cluster agn fraction is approximately an order of magnitude lower over the entire observed redshift range .",
    "one future direction for this research is to push further into the past toward the epoch of cluster galaxy assembly at @xmath20 .",
    "numerous lines of evidence suggest that cluster galaxies formed earlier than their field counterparts , and the hypothesis of black hole and galaxy coevolution predicts that the the agn fraction in dense environments should exceed the field value by this point . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the identification of the properties of the `` transition '' group environment , in which the agn fraction drops from the field to the cluster value , can potentially shed substantial light on the nature of the mechanism(s ) responsible for triggering and fueling agn .",
    "finally , measurements of star formation and black hole accretion rates in the same cluster samples could reveal the extent of the correlation exhibited by individual galaxies and provide new insights into the physical processes that drive the observed coevolution .",
