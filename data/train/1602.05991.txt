    "the top quark is by far the heaviest particle of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , with a mass of @xmath14 @xcite . up to now",
    ", the top quark has only been studied at the tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "its large mass implies that the top quark is the sm particle most strongly coupled to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . this is the principal reason it is considered to be one of the most likely places where new physics might be discovered .",
    "this means the top quark is a window to any new physics at the @xmath15 energy scale .",
    "while much information about the top quark is already available that shows consistency with sm expectations , its properties and interactions are among the most important measurements for present and future high energy colliders @xcite .",
    "the construction of a high - energy @xmath9 international linear collider ( ilc ) has been proposed to complement direct searches carried out at the lhc .",
    "precision measurements of top quark properties , in particular of its couplings , are especially interesting because the top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and thus expected to be more sensitive to new physics at higher scales .",
    "the top quark has been studied in some detail at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "many of its properties are still poorly constrained such as mass , spin , color and electric charges , the electric and magnetic dipole moments and the chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole moments .",
    "therefore , significant new insights on top quark properties will be one of the tasks of the lhc , the ilc @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "the dipole moments of the top quark are some of the most sensitive observable , and although these intrinsic properties have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally , it is necessary to have more precise measurements .",
    "the dipole moments of the top quark have been investigated by several authors and in a variety of theoretical models @xcite .",
    "further , a number of studies show that in the processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the dipole moments of the top quark can be measured with great sensitivity @xcite . however , there are a significant number of top quarks that are produced in single form via the weak interaction",
    ". there are several single top quark production processes of interest in @xmath18 and @xmath19 collisions , characterized by the virtuality of the w boson @xcite .",
    "although studying single top quark production may not be considered of great importance , there are several reasons why its study is necessary in future linear @xmath9 colliders : 1 ) it is a very good alternative to study the dipole moments @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the top quark , as well as the anomalous coupling @xmath20 .",
    "2 ) single top production at clic in association with a @xmath21 boson and bottom quark through @xmath22 production leads to the same final state as @xmath0 quark pair production .",
    "3 ) the cross section for single top quark production processes is significant since production is abundant in @xmath9 colliders that operate at high energies .",
    "in addition , the single top quark production is directly proportional to the square of the @xmath20 coupling , and therefore it is potentially very sensitive to the @xmath20 structure @xcite .",
    "4 ) single top quarks are produced with nearly @xmath23 polarization due to the weak interaction @xcite .",
    "5 ) new physics can influence single top production by inducing weak interactions beyond the sm weak interactions @xcite , through loop effects @xcite , or by providing new sources of single top quark production @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , it is important to study the properties of the top quark , in particular their dipole moments through the single top quark production processes .    in the sm ,",
    "the prediction for the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) of the top quark is @xmath24 @xcite , which can be tested in current and future colliders , such as lhc and clic .",
    "in contrast , its electric dipole moment ( edm ) is strongly suppressed and less than @xmath25 @xcite , which is much too small to be observed .",
    "it is , however , highly attractive for probing new physics .",
    "the sensitivity to the edm has been studied in models with vector - like multiplets which predicted the top quark edm close to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "there are studies performed via the @xmath27 production for the lhc at @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with limits of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively @xcite .",
    "other limits are reported in the literature : @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are obtained from the branching ratio and the cp asymmetry from radiative @xmath35 transitions @xcite , while the bounds of @xmath36 and @xmath37 come from measurements of @xmath38 cross section with @xmath39 @xmath40 uncertainty , respectively @xcite .",
    "more recent limits on the top quark magnetic and electric dipole moments through the process @xmath41 at the lhc with @xmath28 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 c.l . are @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "sensitivity limits for the anomalous couplings of the top quark through the production process of top quark pairs @xmath16 for the ilc at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath29 and @xmath48 are predicted to be of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the measurements at an electron positron collider lead to a significant improvement in comparison with lhc .",
    "detailed discussions on the dipole moments of the top quark in top quark pairs production at the ilc are reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are no limits reported in the literature on the dipole moments @xmath10 and @xmath11 via single top quark production processes .",
    "cp violation was first observed in a small fraction of @xmath50 mesons decaying to two pions in the sm .",
    "this phenomenology in the sm can be easily introduced by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mechanism in the quark sector .",
    "for this reason , the presence of new physics beyond the sm can be investigated by examining the electromagnetic properties of the top quark that are defined with cp - symmetric and cp - asymmetric anomalous form factors .",
    "its dipole moments such as the mdm come from one - loop level perturbations and the corresponding edm , which is described as a source of cp violation .",
    "following references @xcite , the definition of the general effective coupling @xmath27 , including the sm coupling and contributions from dimension - six effective operators , can be parameterized by the following effective lagrangian :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath53 is the top quark electric charge and @xmath54 the lorentz - invariant vertex function which describes the interaction of a @xmath2 photon with two top quarks and can be parameterized by    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the mass of the top quark , @xmath57 is the momentum transfer to the photon and the couplings @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real and related to the anomalous magnetic moment and the electric dipole moment of the top quark , respectively .",
    "the majority of physics research in linear colliders is done assuming positron and electron beams are unpolarized . however , another significant advantage of the linear colliders is to obtain suitability of a highly polarized electron beam that can be polarized up to @xmath58 .",
    "a polarized electron beam provides a method to investigate the sm and to diagnose new physics beyond the sm .",
    "observation of even the tiniest signal which conflicts with the sm expectations would be persuasive evidence for new physics .",
    "proper selection of the electron beam polarization may therefore be used to enhance the new physics signal and also to considerably suppress backgrounds .    in this work",
    "we study the sensibility of the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the top quark through the processes @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the compton backscattering photon ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the weizsacker - williams photon ) which are among the most important sources of single top quark production @xcite .",
    "we use center - of - mass energies of the clic @xcite .",
    "these values are for a center - of - mass energy of @xmath59 with integrated luminosity of @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 , and polarized and unpolarized electron beams @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "not only can the future @xmath65 linear collider be designed to operate in @xmath65 collision mode , but it can also be operated as a @xmath66 and @xmath67 collider .",
    "this is achieved by using compton backscattered photons in the scattering of intense laser photons on the initial @xmath65 beams .",
    "another well - known application of linear colliders is to study new physics beyond the sm through @xmath68 and @xmath69 collisions .",
    "a quasireal @xmath70 photon emitted from one of the incoming @xmath71 or @xmath72 beams interacts with the other lepton shortly after , generating the subprocess @xmath73 .",
    "hence , first we calculate the main reaction @xmath74 by integrating the cross section for the subprocess @xmath73 . in this case , the quasireal photons in @xmath75 collisions can be examined by equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite using the weizsacker - williams approximation ( wwa ) . in epa",
    ", photons emitted from incoming leptons which have very low virtuality are scattered at very small angles from the beam pipe .",
    "these emitted quasireal photons have a low @xmath76 virtuality and are therefore almost real .",
    "we only use the photon virtuality of @xmath77 . also , we can add parts related to the large values of @xmath78 which do not significantly contribute to obtaining sensitivity limits on the anomalous couplings @xcite .",
    "these processes have been observed phenomenologically and experimentally at the lep , tevatron and lhc @xcite .",
    "taking all of the aforementioned into account , we study the potential of the processes @xmath1 and @xmath79 via compton backscattering and wwa , respectively , and derive bounds on the dipole moments @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath80 and @xmath81 level ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 c.l . ) , and at a future high - energy and high - luminosity linear electron positron collider , as the clic , to study the sensibility on the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the top quark .",
    "the corresponding schematic and feynman diagrams for the main reactions as well as for the subprocesses which give the most significant contribution to the total cross section are shown in figs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study the dipole moments of the top quark through the process @xmath84 and in section iii , through the process @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section iv .",
    "in this section we present numerical results of the cross section for the process @xmath84 , using the calchep @xcite packages for calculations of the matrix elements and cross sections .",
    "these packages provide automatic computation of the cross sections and distributions in the sm as well as their extensions at tree level .",
    "we consider the high - energy stage of possible future linear @xmath86 collisions with @xmath87 and 3@xmath88 and design luminosity 50 , 300 , 500 , 1000 , 1500 and 2000@xmath89 according to the new data reported by the clic @xcite .",
    "in addition , in all numerical analysis we consider the @xmath90-tagging efficiency of @xmath91 , systematic uncertainty of @xmath92 and the acceptance cuts will be imposed as @xmath93 for pseudorapidity , @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath95 for transverse momentums of the final state particles .",
    "we also consider the hadronic decay channels of the top quark @xmath97 ( hadronic branching ratio ) .",
    "there are systematic uncertainties for hadron colliders for single top quark production @xcite .",
    "for example , these uncertainties arise from luminosity , jet identification , backgrounds , @xmath98 , etc .. on the other hand , linear colliders have less uncertainties with respect to hadron colliders for determination of the cross section of single top quark production @xcite .",
    "therefore , for events estimation in @xmath99 analysis , we have taken into account @xmath98 as well as consider systematic uncertainties of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the values close to this systematic uncertainty value have been taken into account in previous studies , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , a @xmath102 systematic error in the total cross section has been assumed for the @xmath103 process at the ilc . it can seen that the systematic error in the cross section determination has been lowered from @xmath102 to @xmath104 @xcite . however , since there is no study related to the systematic error on the single top quark production at the clic , we use systematic errors of @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the processes studied in this paper .    in our study",
    "we examined the projected @xmath80 and @xmath81 sensitivities on the dipole moments @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the top quark for the processes @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the compton backscattering photon ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the weizsacker - williams photon ) at the clic-1.4 @xmath15 and clic-3 @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we use the chi - squared distribution test defined as    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the total cross section including contributions from the sm and new physics , @xmath107 , @xmath108 is the statistical error , @xmath109 is the systematic error and @xmath110 is the number of signal expected events @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the @xmath98 and @xmath113 is the integrated clic luminosity .      with polarized beams of electrons and positrons , the cross section of a process can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath114,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath115 is the polarization degree of the electron ( positron ) beam , while @xmath116 stands for the cross section for completely left - handed polarized @xmath117 beam @xmath118 and completely right - handed polarized @xmath119 beam @xmath120 , and other cross sections @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are defined analogously .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams for the process @xmath84 that give the most important contribution to the total cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this figure",
    "the feynman diagrams ( 1)-(3 ) correspond to the contribution of the sm , while diagram ( 4 ) corresponds to the anomalous contribution , i.e. , for the @xmath86 collisions there is sm background at the tree level so the total cross section is proportional to @xmath124 , respectively .    to illustrate our results ,",
    "we show the dependence of the cross section on the anomalous couplings @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath84 in fig . 3 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , as well as on unpolarized beams and two different center - of - mass energies @xmath125@xmath15 @xcite , whereas the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) anomalous coupling is kept fixed at zero .",
    "we observed that the cross section is sensitive to the value of the center - of - mass energies .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath126 increases with the collider energy reaching a maximum at the end of the range considered , @xmath127 , and the cross section for @xmath128 increases relative to @xmath129 up to @xmath130 with polarized beams and up to @xmath131 with unpolarized beams . by contrast , in the vicinity of @xmath132 the total cross section is smaller .",
    "we notice that , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath84 production process at an clic - based @xmath86 collider reaches a value of @xmath133 for @xmath128 for polarized and unpolarized beams .",
    "although the cross section for unpolarized beams is approximately half of that of polarized beams , in both cases the @xmath27 coupling could be probed with remarkable sensitivity ( see tables i , ii ) .",
