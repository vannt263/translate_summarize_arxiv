    "topological insulator is one of the most fascinating concepts in physics .",
    "it is characterized by the bulk - edge correspondence : gapless edge modes emerge necessarily along an edge of a topological insulator .",
    "the edge states of the nanoribbon geometry are well studied .",
    "however there are few reports on the bulk - edge correspondence on a nano - scale object with a closed edge , that is a nanodisk , especially with a rough edge . strictly speaking",
    "the topological number is ill - defined for nanodisks since it is given by the integral over the berry connection on the whole brillouin zone , but it is absent . nevertheless ,",
    "when a nanodisk is sufficiently large , it must have all properties of a topological insulator .",
    "thus a natural question is the size effects on the topological properties .",
    "we investigate this point by studying nanodisks made of silicene .",
    "silicene is a honeycomb structure made of silicon atoms .",
    "the low - energy dynamics is described by the dirac theory as in graphene .",
    "however , dirac electrons are massive due to a relatively large spin - orbit gap in silicene .",
    "it attracts much attention since silicene is expected to be topological insulators such as quantum spin - hall states@xcite and quantum anomalous hall states@xcite depending on externally controlable parameters .",
    "indeed , the band gap can be tuned by applying electric field@xcite .",
    "silicene is a topological insulator because of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) . as far as the hamiltonian concerns",
    ", the dynamical properties of silicene are obtained from those of graphene by introducing the soi and the rashba interaction ( ri)@xcite .",
    "graphene nanoribbons show salient electronic properties depending on the edge structure ( zigzag or armchair ) and the width@xcite .",
    "flat bands localized at edge emerge in zigzag graphene nanoribbons .",
    "silicene nanoribbon presents an interesting playground to study the bulk - edge correspondence@xcite . with respect",
    "to graphene nanodisk , there appear zero - energy edge states@xcite , whose number @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the number of sites in @xmath4 and @xmath5 sublattices , respectively , in accord with the lieb theorem@xcite valid on the bipartite lattice .",
    "let us call them the lieb modes .",
    "our concern is the fate of these lieb modes when soi and then ri additionally are introduced into the hamiltonian in view of the bulk - edge correspondence .    in this paper , we investigate how the energy spectrum of a nanodisk with zigzag , armchair or rough edge evolves as soi changes . because of the electron - hole and time - reversal symmetry there is at least one kramers pair of zero - energy states when the number of the lattice sites is odd . by calculating the local density of state",
    ", we show the wave function is localized along the edge .",
    "we also show that up and down spin flows counter - clockwisely even though we can not define the crystal momentum in nanodisk .",
    "the emergence of the helical current is a manifestation that silicene is a qsh insulator .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact that the edge states of graphene nanodisks are standing wave .",
    "we investigate the tight - binding model described by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the creation operator of an electron at @xmath8 site with spin @xmath9 , and @xmath10 runs over all pair of sites which is nearest - neighbor / next - nearest - neighbor , and @xmath11 denote the pauli matrices .",
    "the first term is the nearest - neighbor spin - independent hopping ( nnh ) with transfer energy @xmath12 .",
    "the second term represents the soi with coupling parameter @xmath13 , and @xmath14 if the next - nearset - hopping is counterclockwise around a hexagon , otherwise @xmath15 .",
    "the third term expresses the ri with coupling parameter @xmath16 , @xmath17 for @xmath8 representing the a or b site , and @xmath18 with @xmath19 the vector from the @xmath20 site to the @xmath8 site .",
    "the last term is the staggered potential with coupling @xmath21 .",
    "we denote each term as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 for nnh term , soi term , ri term , staggered term , respectively .    for the bulk system",
    ", the hamiltonian describes a topological insulator when @xmath26 , and a trivial insulator phase when @xmath27 .",
    "we note that graphene is described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath28 .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry operator is defined by @xmath29 under the transformation , the hamiltonian @xmath30 is invariant , but @xmath31 is not .",
    "hence , as far as only the soi is introduced , the system has the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "however , if the ri is additionally introduced , the symmetry is broken .",
    "the deviation from the zero - energy states due to the ri is almost negligible since the effect of ri vainishes at k and k points .",

    "then , @xmath38 and @xmath0 are even .",
    "this counting rule tells that there exists at least one zero - energy kramers pair when @xmath43 is odd .",
    "consequently , we obtain the following counting rule on the number of zero - energy states , @xmath44 instead of the lieb theorem . actually we find the lower bound of this counting rule to hold as far as we have checked numerically .",
    "we refer these two zero modes as the @xmath37 modes for odd @xmath43 , as illustrated in fig.[tri_4 ] , and also the two modes nearest to the fermi level in the valence band as the @xmath37 modes for even @xmath43 , as illustrated in fig.[tri_5 ] .",
    "we can present an intuitive picture of this formula for zigzag triangular nanodisks , as we shortly show : see fig.[figguki ] .",

    ", we show the energy spectra with @xmath75 for zigzag triangular silicene .",
    "we explain typical features .",
    "first , the minimum ( maximum ) of the spectrum in the conduction ( valence ) band is well fitted by the stright line , @xmath73 .",

    "second , there are many states inside the bulk gap for @xmath77 .",
    "they are the lieb modes , which turn into edge channels , as illustrated shematically in fig.[sta](b ) .",
    "the energy of lieb modes changes linearly as a function of staggered potential .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lieb modes are localized only at one sublattice .",
    "the actual bulk band gap does not close due to finite size effects .",
    "we may say that the topological phase transition is rounded in nanodisk geometry .",
    "however , it must manifest itself clearly for sufficiently large nanodisks .",
    "we wish to determine the crossover size beyond which the signal of the topological phase transtion is manifest .    to investigate the finite size effect of topological phase transition quantitatively , we focus on the maximum energy @xmath78 in the valence band as a function of the staggerd potential . in appendix we propose to fit it as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a phenomenological parameter .",
    "we set a gap due to the finite size effects , @xmath81 as illustrated in fig.[sta](b ) .",

    "when @xmath84 , the finite size effects are dominant than the soi . on the other hand , when @xmath85 , we can observe a signature of the topological phase transition .",
    "namely , there is a crossover around @xmath86 whether we can observe topological phase transition . we can estimate the size of this crossover .",
    "the condition on the crossover size would be given by @xmath87 , from which we find @xmath88 the crossover size is @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath63 .",
    "the real value corresponds to @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding size is @xmath93 , which is approximately @xmath94 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have investigated edge states in silicene nanodisks with the help of the particle - hole symmetry and the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we have newly found the counting rule of the zero - energy states , where the existence of the zero - energy states is protected by the particle - hole symmetry when the lattice number is odd and the ri is zero .",
    "we have constructed the low - energy theory of zigzag triangular silicene .",
    "helical edge currents flow around the edge of a nanodisk though the crystal momentum is ill - defined .",
    "next we have studied nanodisks with rough edge .",
    "we have found the validity of the bulk - edge correspondence in silicene nanodisks in general .",
    "the local density of a silicene nanodisk with rough edge can be interpreted by the difference of the penetration length of zigzag and armchair edges .",
    "finally , we found the topological phase transition becomes crossover in silicene nanodisks due to finite size effects .",
    "we have determined the crossover size as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "in the following we estimate the extremum energy @xmath78 in the band spectrum . in the dirac theory the density of states is given by @xmath95 with the step funtion @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "the number of the states @xmath100 between the energy @xmath101 and the fermi energy is given by @xmath102 where the number of the total sites is @xmath103 .",
    "the inversion formula reads @xmath104 where @xmath74 is given by ( [ deltan ] ) with @xmath105 . strictly speaking",
    "the above analysis is valid for sufficiently large nanodisks .",
    "hence it is not justified to apply this to determine the extremum energy by choosing @xmath106 .",
