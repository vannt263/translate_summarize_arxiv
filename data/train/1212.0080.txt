    "statically stable density stratified shear layers are ubiquitous in the atmosphere and oceans .",
    "such shear layers can become hydrodynamically unstable , leading to turbulence and mixing in geophysical flows .",
    "turbulence and mixing strongly influence the atmospheric and oceanic circulation - processes known to play key roles in shaping our weather and climate .",
    "hydrodynamic instability is characterized by the growth of wavelike perturbations in a laminar base flow .",
    "such perturbations can grow at an exponential rate , transforming the base flow from a laminar to a turbulent state . in the present study",
    ", we will theoretically investigate the underlying mechanism(s ) leading to modal ( exponential ) , as well as non - modal , growth of small wavelike perturbations in idealized homogeneous and stratified shear flows .",
    "the classical method used to determine flow stability is the normal - mode approach of linear stability analysis @xcite . under the normal - mode assumption , a waveform can grow or decay but can not deform .",
    "normal - mode perturbations are added to the laminar background flow profile , followed by linearizing the governing navier stokes equations . for inviscid , density stratified shear flows",
    ", the normal - mode formalism leads to the celebrated taylor - goldstein equation , derived independently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the taylor - goldstein equation is an eigenvalue problem which calculates the wave properties like growth - rate , phase - speed , and eigenfunction associated with each normal - mode . for stability analysis ,",
    "the range of unstable wavenumbers and the wavenumber corresponding to the fastest growing normal - mode are of prime interest . in many practical scenarios ,",
    "the taylor - goldstein equation is found to accurately capture the onset of instability @xcite , and it also provides a first order description of the developing flow structures @xcite .    the normal - mode approach , however , has shortcomings .",
    "firstly , it provides limited insight into the physical mechanism(s ) responsible for hydrodynamic instability .",
    "the answer to why an infinitesimal perturbation vigorously grows in an otherwise stable background flow is provided in the form of mathematical theorems - rayleigh - fj@xmath0rtoft s theorem for homogeneous flows , and miles - howard criterion for stratified flows @xcite .",
    "it is often difficult to form an intuitive understanding of shear instabilities from these theorems . since",
    "linear instability is the first step towards understanding the more complicated and highly elusive non - linear processes like chaos and turbulence , it is desirable to explore alternative routes in order to provide additional insight . in this context sir g. i. taylor",
    "writes : `` it is a simple matter to work out with the equations which must be satisfied by waves in such a fluid , but the interpretation of the solutions of these equations is a matter of considerable difficulty '' @xcite .",
    "a second drawback of the normal - mode approach is the normal - mode assumption itself . the extensive work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others have shown that shear allows rapid non - modal transient growth due to non - orthogonal interaction between the modes .",
    "@xcite developed the `` generalized stability theory '' for obtaining the optimal non - modal growth from the singular value decomposition of the propagator matrix of a linear dynamical system .",
    "lord rayleigh was probably the first to inquire about the mechanism behind shear instabilities , and conjectured the possible role of wave interactions @xcite .",
    "lord rayleigh s hypothesis was later corroborated by sir g. i. taylor while he was theoretically studying three - layered flows in constant shear .",
    "he explained the mechanism to be as follows : `` thus the instability might be regarded as being due to a free wave at the lower surface forcing a free wave at the upper surface of separation when their velocities in space coincide '' @xcite .",
    "early explorations of the wave interaction concept have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the first mathematically concrete mechanistic description of stratified shear instabilities was provided by @xcite .",
    "using idealized velocity and density profiles , holmboe postulated that the resonant interaction between stable propagating waves , each existing at a discontinuity in the background flow profile ( density profile discontinuity produces interfacial gravity waves and vorticity profile discontinuity produces vorticity waves ) , yields exponentially growing instabilities .",
    "he was able to show that rayleigh / kelvin - helmholtz ( hereafter , `` kh '' ) instability @xcite is the result of the interaction between two vorticity waves ( also known as rayleigh waves ) .",
    "moreover , holmboe also found a new type of instability , now known as the `` holmboe instability '' , produced by the interaction between vorticity and interfacial gravity waves .",
    "bretherton , a contemporary of holmboe , proposed a similar theory to explain mid - latitude cyclogenesis @xcite .",
    "he hypothesized that cyclones form due to a baroclinic instability caused by the interaction between two rossby edge waves ( vorticity waves in a rotating frame of reference ) , one existing at the earth s surface and the other located at the atmospheric tropopause .",
    "the theories proposed by holmboe and bretherton have been refined and re - interpreted over the years , see @xcite . as reviewed in @xcite , resonant interaction between two edge waves in an idealized homogeneous or stratified shear layer",
    "occurs when these waves attain a phase - locked state , i.e.  they are at rest relative to each other . maintaining this phase - locked configuration , the waves grow equally at an exponential rate .",
    "there is also an alternative description of shear instabilities through wave interactions which was put forward by @xcite .",
    "he introduced the concept of `` negative energy waves '' , which are stable modes , and their introduction into the flow causes a decrease in the total energy .",
    "whether a given wave mode has positive or negative energy depends on the frame of reference used .",
    "instability results when negative energy mode resonates with a positive energy mode , and this occurs when the waves have the same phase - speed and wavelength .",
    "this can be identified by the crossing of dispersion curves for the positive and negative energy modes in a frequency - wavenumber diagram .",
    "yet another mechanistic picture of shear instabilities was proposed by lindzen and co - authors ( summarized in @xcite ) .",
    "this theory , known as the `` over - reflection theory '' , proposes that under the right flow configuration , over - reflection of waves can continuously energize an advective `` orr process '' @xcite which is finally responsible for the perturbation growth .    the present paper focusses on studying shear instabilities in terms of wave interactions .",
    "from the recent review by @xcite it can be inferred that the wave interaction theory is in its early phases of development .",
    "in fact , there is no strong theoretical justification behind the argument that two progressive waves lock in phase and resonate , thereby producing exponentially growing instabilities in a shear layer .",
    "many questions in this context remains unanswered , e.g. ( a ) is there a condition which determines whether two waves will lock in phase ?",
    "( b ) starting from an initial condition , how long does it take for the waves to get phase - locked ?",
    "( c ) if exponentially growing instabilities occur after phase - locking , then what kind of instabilities ( if any ) occur prior to phase - locking ?",
    "a point worth mentioning here is that the phenomenon of phase - locking occurs in diverse problems ranging from biology to electronics @xcite .",
    "in fact `` synchronization '' is an area of study ( in dynamical systems theory ) specifically dedicated to this purpose .",
    "the history of synchronization goes back to the @xmath1th century when the famous dutch scientist christiaan huygens reported his observation of synchronization of two pendulum clocks .",
    "we suspect that there may be an analogy between the fundamental aspects of synchronization theory and that of wave interaction based interpretation of shear instabilities .",
    "if exploited successfully , this analogy could be beneficial in answering some of the key questions concerning the origin and evolution of shear instabilities .    in recent years",
    ", heifetz and co - authors @xcite have extensively studied the interaction between rossby edge waves .",
    "they performed a detailed analysis of non - modal instability and transient growth mechanisms in idealized barotropic shear layers .",
    "modal and non - modal growth occurring due to the interactions between surface gravity waves and a pair of vorticity waves ( existing at the interfaces of a submerged piecewise linear shear layer ) was recently studied by @xcite .",
    "the goal of our paper is to frame a theoretical model of shear instabilities , which could be applied to different idealized ( broken - line ) shear layer profiles ( e.g. the classical profiles studied by rayleigh , taylor or holmboe ) .",
    "the model should be sufficiently generalized in the sense that the constituent wave types need not be specified _ a priori_.",
    "the model should be able to capture the transient dynamics , hence should not be limited to normal - mode waveforms .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : linlin ] we provide a theoretical background of linear progressive waves , and focus on two types of waves - vorticity waves and internal gravity waves .",
    "the wave theory in this section is more generalized than that usually reported in the literature . in ",
    "[ sec : waveint ] we investigate the mechanism of interaction between two progressive waves .",
    "we undertake a dynamical systems approach to better understand the wave interaction problem , especially the resonant condition .",
    "since the wave interaction formulation is not restricted to normal - mode type instabilities , we investigate non - modal / transient growth processes in ",
    "[ sec : matstuff ] . finally in ",
    "[ sec : inst ] we use wave interactions to analyze three well known types of shear instabilities - kh instability ( resulting from the interaction between two vorticity waves ) , taylor - caulfield instability ( resulting from the interaction between two interfacial internal gravity waves ) , and holmboe instability ( resulting from the interaction between a vorticity wave and an interfacial internal gravity wave ) .",
    "consider a fluid interface existing at @xmath2 in an unbounded , inviscid , incompressible , two dimensional ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) flow .",

    "likewise , two oppositely traveling gravity waves are produced in case of a density interface .",
    "we have assumed the interfacial displacement ( or the wave ) to be monochromatic , having a wavenumber @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the interface satisfies the _ kinematic condition _ - a particle initially on the interface will remain there forever .",

    "( [ eq:1freq ] ) shows that the frequency of a wave consists of two components - ( i ) the doppler shift @xmath31 , and ( ii ) the _ intrinsic frequency _ @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",

    "therefore for a stable wave , the vertical velocity field at the interface has to be in quadrature with the interfacial deformation .",
    "another point worth mentioning is that an isolated wave can not accelerate or decelerate on its own , hence @xmath38 should be constant .",
    "this in turn means @xmath39 is a constant quantity .",
    "applying the quadrature condition to ( [ eq:1freq ] ) and ( [ eq:14 ] ) , the magnitudes of the intrinsic frequency and the intrinsic phase - speed become @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the _ intrinsic direction of motion _ of the wave , however , is determined by @xmath42 . for waves moving to the left relative to the interfacial velocity ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 .",
    "similarly for right moving waves , @xmath45 .",
    "when such a stable progressive wave is acted upon by external influence(s ) ( e.g.  when another wave interacts with the given wave , as detailed in  [ sec : waveint ] ) , the quadrature condition is no longer satisfied , i.e.   @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the wave may grow ( @xmath47 ) or decay ( @xmath48 ) , and its intrinsic frequency @xmath49 and phase - speed @xmath38 may change .    in our analyses",
    "we will consider two types of progressive interfacial waves - vorticity waves and internal gravity waves .",
    "vorticity waves , also known as rayleigh waves , exist at a vorticity interface ( i.e.  regions involving a sharp change in vorticity ) .",
    "such interfaces are a common feature in the atmosphere and oceans . in a rotating frame ,",
    "the analog of the vorticity wave is the rossby edge wave which exists at a sharp transition in the potential vorticity .",
    "when rossby edge waves propagate in a direction opposite to the background flow , they are called `` counter - propagating rossby waves '' @xcite .    in order to evaluate the frequency @xmath39 of vorticity waves ,",

    "the conventional derivation of the frequency and phase - speed of a vorticity wave can be found in @xcite .",
    "interfacial gravity waves exist at a density interface , i.e.   a region involving sharp change in density .",
    "the most common example is the surface gravity wave existing at the air - sea interface .",
    "however , in this paper we will only consider waves existing at the interface between two fluid layers having small density difference .",
    "such waves are known as interfacial _",
    "gravity waves ( hereafter , gravity waves ) , and often arise in the pycnocline region of density stratified natural water bodies like lakes , estuaries and oceans . in the case of gravity waves ,",
    "@xmath49 can be evaluated by considering the _ dynamic condition_. this condition implies that the pressure at the density interface must be continuous . let the density of upper and lower fluids be @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the background velocity is constant , and is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "then the linearized dynamic condition at the interface @xmath2 after some simplification becomes ( ( 3.13 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the reduced gravity and @xmath68 is the reference density . under boussinesq approximation @xmath69 . by taking an @xmath3 derivative of ( [ eq : dynbound ] ) and using the streamfunction relation @xmath70 , we get @xmath71 substitution of ( [ eq : eta ] ) and ( [ eq : wi ] ) in ( [ eq : gravrel ] ) yields @xmath72 the quantity @xmath73 . on substituting this relation in ( [ eq:12221 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath74    an important aspect of ( [ eq : gravwaverel ] ) is that it has been derived _",

    "for example , when a single interface is present , inclusion of the kinematic condition in ( [ eq : gravwaverel ] ) produces the well known expression for gravity wave frequency .",
    "this can be shown by substituting ( [ eq:1freq ] ) ( note that this equation has been derived from ( [ eq : kincon ] ) , which is the kinematic condition for a single interface . ) in ( [ eq : gravwaverel ] ) and considering only the positive value : @xmath75 the above equation is the dispersion relation for gravity waves .",
    "substitution of ( [ eq : gravwaverel ] ) in ( [ eq:14 ] ) produces the well known expression for the phase - speed of a gravity wave : @xmath76 the above equation shows that each density interface supports two gravity waves , one moving to the left and the other to the right relative to the background velocity @xmath43 .",
    "it is not uncommon in the literature to use the expressions ( [ eq : gravwaverel111 ] ) and ( [ eq : gravspeed ] ) _ even _ when multiple interfaces are present .",
    "such usage certainly leads to erroneous results , especially when the objective is to study multiple wave interactions .",
    "probably the confusion arises from the traditional derivation of gravity wave frequency and phase - speed @xcite .",

    "some examples of homomorphic equation - sets are : ( [ eq : khh1])-([eq : khh4 ] ) representing kh instability , ( 14a)-(14d ) of @xcite representing barotropic shear instability , and ( 7a)-(7d ) of @xcite representing baroclinic instability of the eady model .",
    "another objective of our work is to provide an intuitive description of shear instabilities , and to find connection with other physical processes .",
    "how two waves can interact to produce instability has been discussed throughout the paper , and schematically represented in figure [ fig : wave_int ] .",
    "we observed an analogy between wit equations and that governing the synchronization of two coupled harmonic oscillators . on the basis of this analogy , we re - framed wit as a non - linear dynamical system .",
    "the resonant configuration of the wave equations translated into a steady state configuration of the dynamical system .",
    "this dynamical system is of the source - sink type ; the source and the sink nodes being the two equilibrium points .",
    "when interpreted in terms of canonical linear stability theory , the source and the sink nodes respectively correspond to the decaying and the growing normal - modes of the discrete spectrum .",
    "the analogous two coupled harmonic oscillator system exhibits two normal modes of vibration - the in - phase and the anti - phase synchronization modes .",
    "the growing normal - mode of wit is analogous to the in - phase synchronization mode , while the decaying normal - mode is analogous to the anti - phase synchronization mode .",
    "although we studied wit in the context of shear instabilities , the framework is actually derived from ( [ eq:23])-([eq:26 ] ) , and is therefore applicable to both sheared and unsheared flows , as well as co - propagating and counter - propagating waves .",
    "as an example , one can study the interaction between deep water surface gravity and internal gravity waves ( which gives rise to barotropic and baroclinic modes of oscillations in lakes ; see @xcite pg .",
    "259 - 261 ) .",
    "the framework can also be extended to the weakly non - linear regime to study multiple - wave interactions leading to resonant triads @xcite .",
    "wit can also be applied to understand liquid - jet instability @xcite .",
    "finally we focus on the implications of using broken - line profiles of velocity and/or density .",
    "these idealizations have allowed us to concentrate only on the discrete spectrum dynamics and understand hydrodynamic instability in terms of interfacial wave interactions .",
    "real profiles are always continuous , hence realistic analysis requires inclusion of the continuous spectrum .",
    "using green s function , @xcite have shown that the continuous spectrum dynamics in a smooth homogeneous shear layer can be understood in terms of infinite number of interacting vorticity ( rossby edge ) waves .",
    "@xcite used the same approach to understand the normal - mode continuous spectrum of smooth stratified shear layers .",
    "these studies indicate that the growth process is better understood through the `` orr mechanism '' of shearing of waves @xcite , than edge wave interactions .",
    "this implies that the intuition brought by wit formulation may become less apparent in continuous systems .",
    "however the applicability of wit in continuous systems can only be properly judged when the current version is modified to include the effects of a continuous spectrum .",
    "we speculate that the analogy between wit and the synchronization of coupled harmonic oscillators can be exploited to obtain an intuitive understanding of continuous spectrum dynamics .",
    "our speculation is based on the work of @xcite , who studied the kuramoto model in the continuous limit , and observed superficial similarities between oscillator synchronization and instabilities in ideal plasmas and inviscid fluids .",
