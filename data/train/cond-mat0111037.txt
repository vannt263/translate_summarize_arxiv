    "since its proposal in the 80 s the behaviour of the parisi @xmath0-replica symmetry breaking ( @xmath0-rsb ) solution of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model has been extensively investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively @xcite . despite this enormous amount of work , which has revealed many of the properties of the solutions , a complete control of the solution is still missing .",
    "one of the reasons can be traced back to the fact that till now only low order expansions were used , moreover applied often to reduced forms @xmath0-replica symmetry breaking equations valid only near the critical temperature . from the numerical point of view",
    "there are only few works which confirm the general properties of the solution but do not allow for high accuracy . on the other hand @xmath0-replica symmetry breaking",
    "solutions of the type encountered in the sk model have been found in other models of interest in different fields , e.g. , in computer science with solvability problems @xcite or in the study of the structural glass transition @xcite .    motivated by these problems we believe that it would be quite useful to have some reliable and efficient tool to find good approximations of the full solution also far from the critical points . in this work",
    "we reconsider two approaches .",
    "the first one is based on expansions for temperatures near the critical temperature @xmath4 . as said above previous works considered only low order expansions @xcite . here , by using algebraic manipulators",
    ", we push the expansion to rather high orders and resumming it via pad resummation technique we are able to a have good estimate of the solution for a wide range of temperature below @xmath4 .",
    "the second approach is numerical .",
    "previous numerical studies of the @xmath0-replica symmetry breaking solution used a naive integration scheme based on the direct discretization of the parisi s equation @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantages of this approach are the large amount of memory needed for a good resolution of the solution and the numerical problems arising when @xmath5 is small . to overcome these problems we developed a new numerical scheme based on a pseudo - spectral algorithm which allows for rather accurate results for all temperatures with a reasonable amount of memory .",
    "moreover the use of pseudo - spectral methods makes the whole code rather fast .",
    "we stress that while the methods we are going to discuss are applied here to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , they have a wider range of application . in principle",
    "can be applied to any model with @xmath0-replica symmetry breaking type solution @xcite .",
    "we find that for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model the parisi solution @xmath2 is not an odd function as one may expect from its physical meaning . at any @xmath6",
    ", the taylor expansion of @xmath2 in powers of @xmath7 contains both odd as well as even powers of @xmath7 .",
    "the only term which is missing is @xmath8 .",
    "the presence of the fourth oder derivative was first noted by temesvari @xcite .",
    "often , instead of @xmath2 , it is more useful to consider the overlap probability distribution function @xmath9 , which gives the probability of finding two states with mutual overlap @xmath10 according to the gibbs measure .",
    "the two quantities are related by @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inverse function of @xmath2 . in the absence of external magnetic fields",
    "the function @xmath9 must be an even function of @xmath10 .",
    "the computed function @xmath2 is however defined only for positive values , therefore it determines only the right branch of the function @xmath9 .",
    "if we define @xmath13 for @xmath14 then full @xmath9 is given by the symmetrized expression @xmath15 it is easy to see that the presence of non - zero even derivatives of @xmath2 at @xmath16 makes the function @xmath9 non analytical at @xmath17 : @xmath18 so that @xmath9 has discontinuous derivatives at @xmath17 .",
    "we shall discuss two different methods of computing the expansions .",
    "the first , discussed in section [ secexp ] , performs expansion before imposing stationarity of the free energy functional .",
    "the two steps however can be inverted , i.e. , the expansion can be done after stationarity is imposed , section [ secderiv ] .",
    "the two approaches are obviously equivalent and the advantage of using one or the other only depends on which quantity one is interested in . since the expansions are likely to be asymptotic some resummation scheme , such as pad discussed in section [ secpad ] , are needed .",
    "finally in section [ secnum ] we present a new integration procedure and compare the analytical results with those obtained from a direct numerical solution of the @xmath0-replica symmetry breaking equations .",
    "the parisi s free energy @xmath19 for a the sk model in an external field @xmath20 at temperature @xmath21 is @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the solution evaluated at @xmath16 of the the parisi s equation @xmath24 \\label{eqphi}\\ ] ] with the boundary condition @xmath25 where we have used the standard notation and denote derivatives with respect to @xmath7 by a dot and derivatives with respect to @xmath26 by a prime .",
    "the order parameter @xmath2 at temperature @xmath21 is obtained by the stationarity condition of ( [ eqfree ] ) with respect to variations of @xmath2 , while the value of ( [ eqfree ] ) at the stationarity point gives the free energy @xmath27 .    to expand the free energy functional ( [ eqfree ] ) in powers of @xmath28 we observe that in the absence of external fields @xmath2 is different from @xmath29 only in a region @xmath30 $ ] with @xmath31 @xcite , so that an expansion in power of @xmath32 must correspond to an expansion of the same order in @xmath7 . therefore to compute the free energy to order @xmath33 we insert into eq .",

    "a time scale @xmath67 can be associated to the order parameter @xmath2 such that for times of order @xmath67 states with an overlap equal to @xmath2 or greater can be reached by the system . in this picture the @xmath60 and @xmath68 become respectively the probability distribution of frozen local fields @xmath26 and the local magnetization in a local field @xmath26 at the time scale labeled by @xmath7 @xcite .    the derivatives of @xmath2 can be obtained by successive @xmath7-derivation of eq .",
    "( [ sp1 ] ) .",

    "note that equation ( [ eq : dev40 ] ) , with equation ( [ m30 ] ) , gives a complete determination of the quartic derivative of @xmath2 at @xmath16 as a function of the temperature @xmath21 and of the first derivative @xmath90 : @xmath91 this relation shows that the function @xmath2 does not have a well defined parity @xcite .",
    "going to higher orders one can show that all the even derivatives can be expressed in terms of the odd ones ; for instance we have @xmath92 and so on .    in the limit @xmath93",

    "note that we have derived this scaling under strong hypothesis that it must be valid asymptotically for @xmath93 and @xmath98 .",
    "this approach also provides an alternative method to compute the expansion of @xmath2 in powers of @xmath7 and @xmath32 : starting from @xmath2 evaluated at a given order in @xmath7 and @xmath32 we can compute @xmath99 through ( [ sp2 ] ) and then @xmath2 at the next order through the set of equations ( [ limz2]),([eq : d40 ] ) , ( [ dev30]),([eq : dev40 ] ) and so on .",
    "the set of equations can be solved iteratively . by this method",

    "unfortunately all the expansions derived in the previous sections are likely to be asymptotic and to obtain sensible estimates of the various quantities of interest some form of resummation must be done . here",
    "we shall consider the standard pad approximants which for a series of degree @xmath101 reads @xcite : @xmath102 where the coefficients are chosen so that the first @xmath103 terms of the taylor expansion of @xmath104 match the the first @xmath103 terms of the of the original series . in the following",
    "we shall call this the pad approximant @xmath105 .",
    "the first problem we faced is that despite the fact that the series have alternate signs , they are not stijlties integral and therefore we can not obtain in a systematic way a sequence of lower and upper bounds @xcite .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by noticing that most of the quantities we are interested in , such as for example free energy or entropy or @xmath29 , do have a null derivative at @xmath106 .",
    "therefore an indication on the quality of the approximants can be obtained by analyzing the behaviour near @xmath106 .",
    "for example , the free energy as a function of @xmath21 is reproduced quite well by many pad approximants , even at very low orders , however some of these have a positive derivative at @xmath106 while others negative , see fig .",
    "[ fig : freepad ] . by inspecting the figure we can safely assume that approximants with positive derivative give an upper bound , while those with negative derivative a lower bound , for the true free energy @xcite .    as a general fact",
    "we obtain that the best pad approximants at a given order in @xmath32 are those with nearly the same degree of the numerator and the denominator .",
    "we stress , however , that as usual with asymptotic expansion an increase of the order in @xmath32 does not necessarily correspond to an improvement of the precision . with this procedure",
    "we obtain for the free energy an estimate with at least @xmath107 digits precision at @xmath108 and @xmath109 digits at @xmath110 , and for the ground state energy @xmath111 in agreement with parisi s estimate @xmath112 @xcite . a similar analysis can be used to determine the value of @xmath1 as a function of temperature , the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmaxpad ] .",
    "the value of the breaking point is finite in the limit @xmath113 @xmath114 see inset figure [ fig : xmaxpad ] , and slightly larger than the value @xmath115 predicted by the parisi - toulouse scaling , in agreement with the approximate nature of this relation @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the function @xmath116 is more complex , because not only the taylor expansion of @xmath2 in powers of @xmath7 around any @xmath117 is likely to be asymptotic for any fixed temperature , but the expansion in @xmath32 of the coefficients of the @xmath7-expansion are themselves non convergent .",
    "therefore one should use a double pad expansion , one for the coefficients and one for @xmath2 .",
    "the procedure however is quite difficult because we do not have a systematic way of choosing the best approximant and , moreover , coefficients of higher order are known with less precision in @xmath32 .",
    "a better approach is to construct the function @xmath2 directly point by point by computing @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120 for fixed @xmath33 . for any @xmath121 and @xmath21 the quantity",
    "@xmath118 is itself a power series in @xmath32 which can be summed up using pad approximants . with this procedure",
    "the function @xmath2 can be determined for different @xmath7-resolution just changing the value of @xmath33 , e.g. , @xmath122 , and using the value of @xmath1 previously found , see fig .",

    ". then one can prove that the expansion of @xmath195 in powers of @xmath196 is asymptotic recalling that standard manipulation ( e.g. multiplication , division , inversion ... ) on an asymptotic expansion in power series do not change its character .",
    "a detailed treatment of the rsb solution is much more complex , but the origin of the asymptotic character is likely to be the same .",
    "indeed an expansion in small @xmath187 ( and therefore in small @xmath195 ) corresponds to an expansion in small @xmath197 of all the quantities like @xmath198 and @xmath199 ; the appearance of integrals of the form @xmath200where @xmath201 generates asymptotic expansions since the taylor expansions of @xmath198 and @xmath199 in powers of @xmath197 do not converge on the whole real axes .",
