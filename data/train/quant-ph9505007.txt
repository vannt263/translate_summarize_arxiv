    "probability theory , and markov processes in particular , are currently recognized as key elements for a proper modelization of various relativistic phenomena within the framework of the euclidean formulation of quantum field theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the construction of a mathematically consistent description of diffusive phenomena in minkowskian spaces must face severe problems .",
    "this is due essentially to the difficulty to make the markovian property compatible with the required relativistic covariance ( for different approaches and proposals concerning this longstanding open problem see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a satisfactory theory seems to be still lacking .",
    "the aim of this work is to introduce a new method for treating phenomena described by markovian diffusions in the configurational space within a relativistic setting . as a first application we procede to perform a covariant stochastic quantization of the free relativistic spinless particle . from a physical point of view",
    ", the idea underlying our construction can be sketched as follows .",
    "let us consider , for the sake of simplicity , a three - dimensional markov diffusion with constant coefficient equal to @xmath2 , satisfying it s stochastic differential equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a drift - field and @xmath5 a standard wiener process . introducing the time dependent density @xmath6 of the process @xmath7",
    ", one can show that under some regularity assumption @xcite there exists a velocity field @xmath8 ( usually called the `` current velocity field '' ) such that the following continuity equation holds : @xmath9 thus , if @xmath4 is sufficiently smooth , to every markov process given by a solution of ( [ diff ] ) can be associated an `` hydrodynamical ( eulerian ) structure '' represented by the time dependent couple @xmath10 , which satisfy the constraint ( [ continuity ] ) .",
    "let us suppose that , together with the diffusion , we are interested to consider , at a generic point @xmath11 and time @xmath12 , basic observable quantities as energy - momentum tensor , entropy , temperature and so on .",
    "thus , in agreement with the approach usually adopted in the relativistic hydrodynamics of a perfect fluid , we would define those objects in the frame of an observer which moves at point @xmath11 and time @xmath12 with velocity @xmath13 ( the `` comoving observer '' at point @xmath11 and time @xmath12 ) .",
    "intuitively , it is therefore reasonable to extend this prescription also to the `` probabilistic '' objects we are considering .",
    "this idea was in fact already exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite to show that it is possible to redefine nelson s stochastic kinematics in a `` small '' neighborhood of properly defined `` comoving observers '' ; starting from this and a suitable extension of the einstein action , the klein - gordon equation for the free relativistic particle was there derived without _ ad hoc _ assumptions .    in the present work",
    "we will go beyond the local approach outlined above , and we introduce instead a `` global comoving coordinate system '' . a non linear transformation is performed on flat space from natural coordinates to a class of comoving ones . our discussion will not depend on the particular choice in this class and the results will be expressed in the language of general curvilinear coordinates .",
    "the method is intimately connected with classical results as frobenius theorem for vector fields and it is close to the construction of cosmic standard coordinates in general relativity ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we will give a precise and simple formulation of the basic mathematical facts which does not seem to be commonly available in the literature and which , in particular , is proper for the application to stochastic quantization .",
    "the content of the work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we give a sufficient condition for a vector field @xmath14 on @xmath15 , induces a `` global comoving coordinate system '' . in sec .",
    "iii the same result is reformulated for vector fields on @xmath0 and pseudo - riemannian manifolds . in sec .",
    "iv we apply these results to redefine nelson s stochastic kinematics for a free relativistic spinless particle and to derive in a simple and fully consistent mathematical way the klein - gordon equation . the stochastic interpretation of different subsets of solutions to this equation is given in sec .",
    "v , where the non relativistic limit is also described . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we discuss some possible physical implications and briefly consider some future developments and applications .",
    "let us consider a vector field @xmath16 .",
    "we shall use for the components of @xmath17 and @xmath14 the notation @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we are searching conditions on @xmath14 so that there exists a coordinate transformation @xmath20 which changes the algebric vector @xmath21 into @xmath22 for every @xmath23 .",
    "the inverse function theorem allows to prove the following :    * theorem 1 : * let @xmath14 be a vector field on @xmath24 with components @xmath25 , which satisfies the following conditions : + _ i_@xmath26 )   @xmath27 + _ ii_@xmath26 )   there exists a scalar field @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 then there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath30 such that @xmath31    _ proof : _ since @xmath14 is @xmath32 , then there exists the congruence @xmath33 generated by @xmath14 .",
    "that is , given any point @xmath34 , there exists a unique integral curve @xmath35 to which @xmath17 belongs . for",
    "a fixed @xmath36 let us consider the equation @xmath37 denoting thus @xmath38 the @xmath39-dimensional vector @xmath40 , by assumptions _",
    "i_@xmath26 ) and _ ii_@xmath26 ) and the implicit function theorem there exists a neighborhood @xmath41 of @xmath38 and a function @xmath42 such that @xmath43 let now @xmath44 denote the border of @xmath45 and @xmath46 any point belonging to @xmath44 . then the @xmath47 may be finite or infinite ( the existence is ensured by the fact that the application of the implicit function theorem in @xmath46 would otherwise lead to a contradiction ) . in the first case one can apply again the implicit function theorem at @xmath46 , and so on .",
    "thus for each @xmath36 equation ( [ implicit ] ) defines a unique regular @xmath39-dimensional hypersurface @xmath48 in @xmath24 .",
    "we also observe that the vector @xmath49 is by construction orthogonal to the surface in the point @xmath17 .",
    "hence we can conclude that for each point @xmath50 in @xmath24 there exists a unique hypersurface @xmath48 and a unique integral curve @xmath51 to which @xmath50 belongs .",
    "in addition , @xmath51 is orthogonal to @xmath48 in @xmath50 . in other words ,",
    "the congruence @xmath33 is globally hypersurface - orthogonal .    to construct the new coordinate system in @xmath24",
    "let us fix a point @xmath52 as new origin and consider @xmath53 ( with the natural orientation ) and @xmath54 .",
    "being @xmath54 a regular hypersurface imbedded in @xmath24 , it is also a @xmath39-dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "let us introduce on it a coordinate system @xmath55 ( notice that this surface has a unique chart @xmath56 ) and let @xmath57 be its metric tensor , induced by the euclidean scalar product in @xmath24 . then to every point @xmath58 there corresponds a unique point on @xmath53 ( intersection between @xmath53 and @xmath59 ) with coordinate @xmath60 and a unique point on @xmath54 ( intersection of @xmath54 and @xmath61 ) with coordinates @xmath62 , and viceversa .",
    "therefore the map ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath63 is one - to - one .",
    "existence and continuity of first - order partial derivatives of @xmath20 immediately follows from the regularity of the integral curves and of the hypersurfaces we are considering .",
    "let us now denote @xmath64 the solution of the ordinary differential equation @xmath65 with initial condition @xmath66 hence we have @xmath67 let us now choose @xmath60 equal to the length of the arc on @xmath53 and @xmath68 .",
    "then we observe that defining @xmath69 by the equality @xmath70 we immediately see that , since @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , only the component @xmath74 is different from zero and it is equal to @xmath75.@xmath76    it is not necessary to particularize the coordinate @xmath77 to be the length of the arc on @xmath53 .",
    "in fact we can prove the following :    _ corollary 1 : _ let @xmath78 be any coordinate on @xmath53 .",
    "introducing on @xmath53 the positive metric function @xmath79 we have @xmath80    _ proof : _ denoting by @xmath81 the length of the arc @xmath82 , we can rephrase eqs .",
    "( [ chainrule])-([vector ] ) by observing that @xmath83 from which the result follows.@xmath76    the coordinate transformation @xmath20 transforms the euclidean metric tensor @xmath84 into a new one , which we denote by @xmath85 .",
    "this transformed tensor has in turn a particularily simple structure , as one can immediately recognize by observing that any vector @xmath86 applied at the point @xmath17 can be decomposed into two orthogonal vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath87 is tangent to @xmath61 at @xmath17 and @xmath88 is tangent to @xmath59 at @xmath17 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath89 where as before @xmath79 and @xmath90 are the components of the metric tensor of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the given coordinate @xmath60 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "thus we can state the following :    _ corollary 2 : _ the global coordinate transformation @xmath91 , transforms the euclidean metric tensor @xmath84 into the tensor @xmath85 with components @xmath92    owing to the explicit structure of the transformed metric tensor , we are able to completely characterize our construction from the geometric point of view . in particular , being the map @xmath20 a global coordinate transformation on flat space @xmath24 , we know that the riemann curvature tensor associated to @xmath93 identically vanishes .",
    "we shall see now that this property extends to @xmath94 , so that @xmath54 eventually has only an extrinsic curvature .",
    "we summarize the result in the following :    _ corollary 3 : _ the hypersurface @xmath54 has zero intrinsic curvature .    _",
    "proof : _ we need to prove that the @xmath39-dimensional riemann curvature tensor @xmath95 @xmath96 associated to @xmath94 is equal to zero . starting from the @xmath97-dimensional tensor associated to @xmath93 , let us express it , as usual , in terms of christoffel symbols : @xmath98 from corollary 1 and the well known general relation @xmath99 one can easily check that the connection @xmath44 induced from @xmath93 has a particularily simple structure , which we write as @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 corresponding to the metrics on @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively . exploiting this fact , eq .",
    "( [ riemann1 ] ) becomes @xmath103 the left hand side is zero by flatness , so that necessarily @xmath104.@xmath76    it is also worth to stress that , as usually done in the theory of riemannian manifolds , we can introduce normal coordinates @xmath105 in a neighborhood @xmath106 of each point @xmath58 .",
    "this is obtained by choosing normal coordinates both in the one - dimensional neighborhood of the projection of @xmath17 on @xmath53 and in the @xmath39-dimensional neighborhood of the projection of @xmath17 on @xmath54 along @xmath33 .",
    "( indeed , due to the flatness of @xmath54 ( corollary 3 ) , this can be done globally , so that it possible to define a coordinate system that yields an orthonormal coordinate basis at every point of @xmath24 ) .",
    "hence , in case @xmath52 coincides with @xmath107 , the linear part of the transformation @xmath108 can be thought as a rotation on @xmath24 which aligns the @xmath109-axis along the direction of the vector field and which is different from point to point if the latter is not constant .",
    "in this section the minkowski spacetime @xmath0 is understood to be endowed with the standard euclidean topology .",
    "( by the way , in the literature the so - called `` path topology '' has also been considered @xcite , nevertheless it looks quite unsuitable in our setting ) .",
    "then it is straigthforward to extend theorem 1 :    * theorem 1@xmath110 : * let @xmath0 be equipped with the euclidean topology and let @xmath111 the minkowskian metric tensor . if @xmath14 is a vector field on @xmath0 with covariant components @xmath112 satisfying the following conditions : + _ i_@xmath26 )   @xmath113 + _ ii_@xmath26 )   there exists a scalar field @xmath114 , such that @xmath115 then there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath20 such that @xmath116    _ proof : _ with the given topology , @xmath0 is a pseudo - riemannian manifold with a unique chart @xmath117 , cartesian natural coordinates and metric tensor @xmath118 .",
    "thus the proof of theorem 1 remains the same as far as it does not involve the metric tensor .",
    "this occurs only where we assert that the vector @xmath21 is orthogonal to @xmath59 at point @xmath17 .",
    "but we have seen that the euclidean product between a vector with ( covariant ) components @xmath119 and any vector @xmath120 which is tangent to @xmath54 at point @xmath17 is equal to zero .",
    "hence we can write @xmath121 so that , by the arbitrariness of the tangent vector @xmath122 , the vector @xmath123 is orthogonal to @xmath59 at the point @xmath17 in the minkowskian metric",
    ". @xmath76",

    "some remarks are now in order .",
    "first of all , we notice that the set of solutions restricted by conditions ( [ conditions ] ) is not empty since it contains at least all _ positive frequency _ plane - wave solutions ( in a suitable limit of non normalized @xmath299 ) .",
    "note also that the positivity constraint on @xmath300 consistently allows to interpret it as a conserved density in hydrodynamical sense .",

    "( this is trivially obtained by substituting the non normalized density @xmath303 in place of @xmath6 at the beginning of our derivation ) .",
    "a less obvious fact is that it is possible to give a fully probabilistic interpretation also to solutions with energy .",
    "the idea can be sketched as follows .",
    "let us start from a @xmath170-valued diffusion having zero current velocity and satisfying the stationary stochastic differential equation @xmath304\\;,\\:dt>0\\ ; , \\label{stocdiff}\\ ] ] with @xmath187 denoting , as usual , the osmotic velocity and @xmath305 arbitrary .",
    "let us now think of a diffusion with a `` specular '' time evolution . in order to have an example of a ( classical ) phenomenon that would be described by means of such a `` specular '' diffusion",
    ", one could imagine a cloud of brownian particles which , starting from an initial spreaded spatial distribution , would concentrate after some interval of time in a small region .",
    "this is a `` rare '' event to which usual probabilistic models would give zero probability , but which is not , of course , in principle impossible . to get a mathematical description in terms of `` forward '' differentials ,",
    "let us firstly introduce time - reversal in the usual way : @xmath306 where @xmath307 is a fixed positive time increment .",
    "we have immediately from ( [ timereversal ] ) @xmath308 but @xmath309 is assigned from eq .",
    "( [ stocdiff ] ) ; in particular , we can use the corresponding so - called `` backward representation '' to write @xmath310 where we have exploited the relation @xmath311 holding in this particular stationary case@xcite , and where @xmath177 is a standard reversed wiener process , that is a process which has all properties of an usual wiener process except from the fact that its increments are independent of the @xmath94-algebra generated by the future of @xmath312 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath313 from the definitions and the properties of @xmath177 , one can immediately see that @xmath314 is a standard wiener process ( which , loosely speaking , `` goes forward in time '' ) . by inserting eq .",
    "( [ wprimo ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ backward ] ) , we are able to write , after standard manipulations , a stochastic differential equation for the diffusion @xmath315 , namely @xmath316\\;,\\;dt>0\\;. \\label{reversed}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ reversed ] ) provides a possible forward description of what we have called a `` specular diffusion '' .",
    "now , all of these considerations can be extended to the stationary kinematics in comoving coordinates .",
    "we can thus conclude that to every solution of the klein - gordon equation with positive @xmath317 there corresponds a solution where @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath318 .",
    "the first one is stochastically represented by a stationary diffusion in the comoving coordinates ( with respect to the invariant parameter @xmath12 ) , while the second one corresponds to the `` rare event '' of a `` specular diffusion '' .",
    "changing the parameter @xmath12 into @xmath318 simply leads to a change of sign in @xmath250 , as one can easily see recalling eq .",
    "( [ essetilde ] ) and the fact that @xmath250 is a scalar by construction .",
    "then @xmath317 becomes negative and consequently @xmath319 is also negative at every point .",
    "this furnishes us with the desired interpretation .",
    "having clarified how different subsets of solutions to klein - gordon equation can receive different stochastic interpretation , we are now in position to study the non relativistic limit described by schrdinger equation . since the latter represents the evolution equation for the quantum state of a single standard spinless particle , we need to consider only those solutions which satisfy conditions ( [ conditions ] ) ; in addition , we must also select those for which @xmath320 .",
    "we expect that these last solutions approximately solve dynamical equations equivalent to the schrdinger one .",

    "( [ spatial ] ) becomes then @xmath340 + ( v \\cdot \\nabla ) \\,v + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\hat{t } } \\,=\\,0 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this , together with the continuity equation , is nothing but the hydrodinamical form of schrdinger equation , which we have also quoted in ( [ dynamics ] ) .",
    "the temporal component of the dynamical equation ( [ hydrodin ] ) gives rise instead to the following one - dimensional relation : @xmath341   \\nonumber \\\\    & + & \\biggl ( \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2 } } } \\nabla \\biggr ) \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2 } } } + \\biggl ( \\frac{c } { \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2 } } } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^0 } \\biggr ) \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\,=\\,0 \\;.   \\label{temporal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last two terms are readily recognized to be neglegible in the limit @xmath329 .",
    "recalling the explicit form of @xmath342 coming from ( [ u1 ] ) , we see that the other terms depend on @xmath330 .",
    "this proves the assertion .",
    "it is worth to note that the quantum non relativistic limit appears as an approximation of the correct relativistic dynamical equations from a twofold point of view : firstly , the approximation @xmath320 corresponding to the classical non relativistic limit is done ; secondly , terms depending on @xmath330 are also neglected .",
    "this fact is perhaps a little unexpected and conceptually intriguing .",
    "furthermore , an important point of this approach needs to be stressed here , namely the fact that _ in the relativistic framework no diffusion process is supposed to exist for the inertial observer_. a simple probabilistic interpretation is consequently lost in a generic inertial frame .",
    "this difficulty may be considered , in a sense , as the stochastic counterpart of non trivial questions which , in the framework of canonical quantization , are related to a consistent definition of observable quantities , such as position operator ( see @xcite and @xcite for any detail ) . in our procedure , the reason for this fact is that , as observed above , the wiener process has sample paths which can `` go outside '' the light cone , so that there exist inertial frames where such spacelike trajectories would appear as going forward and backward in time .    on the other hand",
    ", such a peculiarity disappears in the non relativistic limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the usual nelson s quantization becomes consistent with the proposed procedure in a non relativistic setting .",
    "the first observation to be done is that stochastic quantization of the free spinless relativistic particle based on comoving ( local or global ) coordinates is very clean both from a mathematical and a physical point of view .",
    "in fact , on one side all probabilistic objects are well defined ; on the other side , once given stochastic kinematics in the comoving coordinates , dynamical equations naturally emerge from a stochastic version of the einstein action , by means of the stationary action principle .",
    "no additional _ ad hoc _ assumptions are necessary , at variance with the path integral approach @xcite and previous attempts within stochastic frameworks which we have already quoted .",
    "we also observe that the stochastic quantization procedure proposed in this work gives only to the subset of solutions to klein - gordon equation with positive energy and normalized four - current the physical meaning of representing the quantum evolution of single free relativistic spinless particle .",
    "as is well known , this is a consistency property which is not easily achieved within standard canonical ( first ) quantization @xcite .    on the other side",
    "it may be interesting that one can give a probabilistic interpretation also to other solutions of klein - gordon equation , in particular to those with negative energy in terms of specular diffusions as `` rare events ''",
    ".    it may also be worthwhile to insist on the fact that the comoving coordinates approach allows to more properly understand how to handle covariant and non covariant quantities .",
    "dynamical equations ( which do not contain stochastic terms ) are lorentz covariant , while markovian kinematics is not : in fact , the latter is covariant only with respect to reparametrizations on @xmath343 and @xmath253 .",
    "we point out that global comoving coordinates approach introduces a description of the motion of the particle which is well defined on the whole @xmath0 ( this in particular provides the technical advantage of eliminating all spurious boundary terms which come out in the local derivation @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it directly leads to a dynamical theory which is covariant with respect to _ arbitrary _ changes of space - time coordinates .    indeed the results presented in this paper look suitable for the extension to the description of a quantum particle subjected to a gravitational ( classical ) field .",
    "in this case one can furthermore conceive that , in presence of strongly peaked gravitational fields , the degeneracy among the energy levels of the four - dimensional dynamical equation ( [ fourschrod ] ) breaks down .",
    "this is an aspect of the outlined stochastic quantization procedure which deserves further investigation @xcite .    from another point of view",
    ", it would be also appealing both on mathematical and physical grounds to consider a sort of _ second _ stochastic quantization , by reinterpreting the probability density in the comoving coordinates as a physical scalar field in a space - time dependent random medium .",
