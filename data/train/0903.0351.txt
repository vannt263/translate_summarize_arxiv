    "the constructive role of noise on dynamical systems includes hopping between multiple stable attractors @xcite and stabilization of the lorenz attractor near the threshold of its formation @xcite .",
    "such type behavior is inherent in finite systems which involve discrete entities ( for instance , in ecological systems individuals form population stochastically in accordance with random births and deaths ) .",
    "examples of substantial alteration of finite systems under effect of intrinsic noises give epidemics @xcite@xcite , predator - prey population dynamics @xcite , opinion dynamics @xcite , biochemical clocks @xcite , genetic networks @xcite , cyclic trapping reactions @xcite , etc .    within the phase - plane language",
    ", phase transitions pointed out present the simplest case , where a fixed point appears only .",
    "we are interested in studying more complicated situation , when the system under consideration may display oscillatory behavior related to the limit cycle appearing as a result of the hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "it has long been conjectured @xcite that in some situations the influence of noise would be sufficient to produce cyclic behavior @xcite .",
    "recent consideration @xcite allows the relation between the stochastic oscillations in the fixed point phase and the oscillations in the limit cycle phase to be elucidated .",
    "moreover , excitable @xcite , bistable @xcite and close to bifurcations @xcite systems display oscillation behavior , whose adjacency to ideally periodic signal depends resonantly on the noise intensity @xcite , that was a reason to call these oscillations coherence resonance @xcite or stochastic coherence @xcite .",
    "control of the coherence resonance regime was shown to be achieved with a time - delayed feedback , which enables to increase or decrease the regularity of motion @xcite .",
    "characteristically , a quasioscillatory behavior may be organized without any input signal , provided a stochastic nonlinear system has itself an intrinsic time scale .",
    "if this scale is driven by a multiplicative noise , which induce bistable behavior in a deterministically monostable medium , then a doubly stochastic resonance arises @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to formulate the model related to systems with finite number @xmath0 of constituents is to consider the sum @xmath1 of random state vectors @xmath2 with components @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",

    "a systematic study of corrections due to finite system size can capture the behavior of fluctuations @xmath9 about the mean - field solution .",
    "these fluctuations are governed with the langevin equations , however , in difference of approach @xcite , we consider multiplicative noises instead of additive ones , on the one hand , and nonlinear forces instead of linear ones , on the other . within such framework ,",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend analytical descriptions @xcite of finite - size stochastic effects to non - equilibrium systems where noises play a crucial role with respect to periodic limit cycle solution creation or its supression .",
    "we will show that character of the stationary behavior of non - equilibrium system is determined by relation between scales of temporal variation of principle variables as well as their coupling .",
    "in contrast to the doubly stochastic resonance @xcite , we consider the case when multistable state is caused by both multiplicative noise and offset from equilibrium state .",

    "is created only in the case if the most fast variation displays a principle variable , which is coupled nonlinearly with two other degrees of freedom or more .",
    "opposite case is studied in section [ sec.4 ] to show that the limit cycle disappears in non - equilibrium steady state .",
