    "the determination of hadronic parameters , in particular meson - baryon coupling constants , requires some information about the physics at large distances . therefore one has to employ some specific nonperturbative method to obtain detailed predictions . among the various nonperturbative methods , qcd sum rules @xcite have proved to be very useful to extract the low - lying hadron masses and coupling constants .",
    "this method is a framework which connects hadronic parameters with qcd parameters .",
    "it is based on short - distance operator product expansion ( ope ) in the deep euclidean region of vacuum - vacuum correlation function in terms of quark and gluon condensates .",
    "further progress has been achieved by an alternative method @xcite known as the qcd sum rules on the light cone .",
    "the light cone qcd sum rules method is based on ope on the light cone which is an expansion over the twist of the operators rather than the dimensions of the operators as in the traditional qcd sum rules approaches . in this expansion ,",
    "the main contribution comes from the lowest twist operators .",
    "the matrix elements of non - local composite operators between meson and vacuum states define the meson wave functions .",
    "the light - cone qcd sum rules have been employed to study hadronic properties and these application can be found in @xcite-@xcite and references therein .    in this work",
    "we study the @xmath1 transition and we employ the light - cone qcd sum rules approach to calculate the @xmath0 coupling @xmath2 .",
    "we note that this coupling constant was investigated by using the traditional qcd sum rules method in the soft pion limit @xcite . in the spirit of the philosophy of the light cone qcd sum rules we study the time - ordered two - point correlation function of the interpolating field for @xmath3 and @xmath4 with pion .",
    "we use a dispersion relation that relates the hadronic spectral density to the correlation function and thus write the correlator in terms of phenomenological hadronic spectrum . since the interpolating fields are written in terms of quark fields , we also calculate this correlator directly from qcd on the light cone .",
    "we consider the structure @xmath5 and match these two descriptions . in order to calculate the coupling constant @xmath2",
    ", we invoke the double boorel transformation so that the excited states and the continuum contributions can be safely seperated out .",
    "we consider the two - point correlation function with pion @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the four - momentum and the interpolating current of delta , @xmath9 the interpolating current of nucleon , and @xmath10 the four - momentum of pion .",
    "the interpolating currents for delta and nucleon @xcite are    @xmath11    where a , b , c are the color indices , @xmath12 is the charge conjugation matrix , t denotes transpose , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are up and down quark fields respectively .      performing double borel transformation over the variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 on the phenomenological part in eq . ( 9 ) , and then equating the result obtained for the lorentz structure @xmath42 part to that theoretical result given in eq . (",
    "18 ) we finally obtain the sum rule for the coupling constant @xmath2 @xmath43 we note that this sum rule depends on the value of the wave functions at a specific point , which are much better known than the whole wave functions @xcite .",
    "the various parameters we adopt are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in our calculation of the theoretical part we use the two particle pion wave functions based on the qcd sum rule approach given in @xcite as @xmath50~ , \\nonumber \\\\ \\varphi_{\\sigma}(u,\\mu)&= & 6u\\bar{u}~\\big [ ~1+c_{2}\\frac{3}{2}~[~5(u-\\bar{u})^{2}-1~ ] + c_{4}\\frac{15}{8}~[~21(u-\\bar{u})^{4}-14(u-\\bar{u})^{2}+1~]~\\big ] ~ , \\nonumber \\\\ \\varphi_{p}(u,\\mu)&= & 1+b_{2}\\frac{1}{2}~[~3(u-\\bar{u})^{2}-1~ ] + b_{4}\\frac{1}{8}~[~35(u-\\bar{u})^{4}-30(u-\\bar{u})^{2}+3~]~ , \\nonumber \\\\ g_{1}(u,\\mu)&= & \\frac{5}{2}\\delta^{2}(\\mu)u^{2}\\bar{u}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon ( \\mu ) ~[~u\\bar{u}(2 + 13u\\bar{u})+10u^{3}\\ln u~(2 - 3u+\\frac{6}{5}u^{2 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 10\\bar{u}^{3}\\ln \\bar{u}~(2 - 3\\bar{u}+\\frac{6}{5}\\bar{u}^{2})~]~ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_{2}(u,\\mu)&=&\\frac{10}{3}\\delta^{2}u\\bar{u}(u\\bar{u})~ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_{2}(u,\\mu)&=&\\frac{5}{3}\\delta^{2}u^{2}\\bar{u}^{2}~ , \\label{e20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the gegenbauer polynomials defined as @xmath54~ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "c_{4}^{3/2}(2u-1)&=&\\frac{15}{8}~[~21(2u-1)^{4}-14(2u-1)^{2}+1~]~ , \\label{e21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath55 , @xmath56 corresponding to the normalization point @xmath57 .",
    "the remaining parameters are taken from the qcd sum rule estimates of ref . @xcite as @xmath58 , and @xmath59 and from those of refs.@xcite as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "since the mass difference of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is not very significant , we let @xmath64 from which it follows that @xmath65 .",
    "we study the dependence of the sum rule of eq .",
    "( 19 ) on the continuum threshold @xmath36 and on the borel parameter @xmath66 .",
    "we find that the sum rule is very stable with resonable variations of @xmath36 and @xmath66 as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . in order to determine the value of the coupling constant @xmath2 from the sum rule eq . ( 19 ) , the residues @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the hadronic currents are needed .",
    "we use the following values that are obtained from the corresponding sum rules for @xmath4 and @xmath3 which are @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 we substitute these values of the residues into the sum rule in eq .",
    "( 19 ) , and further study the dependence of @xmath2 on the continuum threshold @xmath36 and on the borel parameter @xmath66 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "2 , examination of which indicates that it is quite stable with resonable variations of @xmath36 and @xmath66 .",
    "we thus obtain the coupling constant @xmath2 as @xmath71 the uncertainty we included is due to the variation of the continuum threshold and the borel parameter .    finally , we consider the lagrangian density in eq .",
    "( 4 ) and obtain the expression for the decay width as @xmath72 where the pion momentum @xmath73 is @xmath74 we use the experimental result @xcite for the decay width and obtain the coupling constant as @xmath75 which indicates that our value in eq . ( 24 ) is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental result .    in summary",
    ", we calculated @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath2 using light - cone qcd sum rules . our result is consistent with the results obtained using traditional qcd sum rules @xcite and it is in good agreement with the value of the coupling constant deduced from the experimental decay rate of @xmath76 baryon .",
