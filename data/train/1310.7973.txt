    "a packing can be described as an ensemble of particles with given position and orientation , having interparticle contacts such that ( _ i _ ) there is no overlap between particles , ( _ ii _ ) force and torque balances are satisfied on every particle , and ( _ iii _ ) the packing is rigid , _ ie _ there is no displacement of particles , individual or collective , that does not create a violation of conditions ( _ i _ ) or ( _ ii _ ) ( except for global translation or rotation of the packing ) . in this work ,",

    "we follow another route , since we are interested in @xmath82 for not only one packing but over the ensemble of all random packings .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : cavity_averaged ] ) stands out as the main and crucial difference with previous approaches , in particular the q - model  @xcite and edwards description  @xcite .",
    "although these approaches also neglect correlations , our work does not reduce to those models due to a fundamentally different way of treating the disorder in the packing . here , we consider a site - dependent @xmath48 , where the edwards model and q - model create all sites equal .",
    "thus in our method the average over the packing configurations is not done at the same level as the average over forces .",
    "that is , we perform a quenched average over the disorder of the graph . as random packings in two or three dimensions",
    "have a rather small connectivity , the fluctuations in the environment of one particle are large : no particle stands in a ` typical ' surrounding .",
    "hence , the average over the ` quenched ' disorder ( the packing configurations ) must be done with care .",
    "averaging directly  eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_eq ] ) ( a so - called ` annealed ' average in spin - glass terminology ) , as the previously cited approaches do  @xcite , amounts to neglect the site to site fluctuations . performing a ` quenched ' average as in  eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_averaged ] ) , however , allows to take into account these fluctuations correctly  @xcite , and leads to a force distribution which is the average force distribution over the ensemble of possible packings , as opposed to the force distribution of an averaged packing .",
    "this issue becomes also crucial to the study of the satisfiability transition of force and torque balances .",
    "for example , the q - model describes a force distribution in a packing of frictionless spheres ( _ ie _ it finds solution to force balance ) , even in cases where we know there is no solution , such as when @xmath109 in 3-d frictionless systems .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the entropy defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : partition_function ] ) . the annealed average over disorder done in the q - model amounts to compute the averaged partition function @xmath110 , and get the entropy through @xmath111 , with @xmath64 defined in eq .",

    "but one can show that @xmath110 is always finite for @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath113 , an infinite row of perfectly aligned spheres will satisfy force and torque balances and will contribute to the partition function .",
    "a straightforward generalization of this example shows that for @xmath112 , the annealed entropy is finite . on the contrary ,",
    "the quenched average amounts to compute the averaged entropy @xmath114 .",
    "now , for our frictionless sphere example , typical configurations with @xmath109 can not satisfy force balance , and their diverging negative entropy will dominate the average @xmath115 .",
    "hence , the quenched average correctly captures the satisfiability / unsatisfiability transition at @xmath116 while the annealed average does not .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : cavity_averaged ] ) is typically hard to solve , since it is a self - consistent equation for a distribution of distributions @xmath98 . for this purpose ,",
    "we use a population dynamics algorithm ( shown in the next section ) , familiar to optimization problems @xcite .",
    "this method consists to describe the distribution @xmath117 via a discrete sampling ( a ` population ' ) made of a large number of distributions @xmath45 . applying iteratively eq .",

    "it is interesting to discuss the different types of solutions expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_averaged ] ) . for a given contact network ,",
    "if the system is satisfiable and underdetermined , hence admits an infinite set of solutions for force and torque balances , the distributions @xmath118 should be broad , allowing each force to take values in a non - vanishing range .",
    "this means that on each contact , @xmath119 and @xmath120 should be broad and overlapping . if the system is neither under- nor overdetermined ( _ ie _ isostatic ) , there is only one solution to force and torque balances for every site @xmath34 , and each @xmath118 is a dirac @xmath97-function centered on the solution .",
    "if the system is overdetermined or unsatisfiable , there is typically no solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_averaged ] ) , meaning that an algorithm designed to solve it would not converge . in practice , since we perform a population dynamics algorithm to average over all possible packings , if one starts with a set @xmath121 of broad distributions as a guess for the solution , both isostatic and overdetermined ensembles show that all @xmath121 shrink to @xmath97-distributions after a few iterations , while underdetermined ensemble always gives broad ( not vanishing ) probabilities . therefore the threshold @xmath4 of the satisfiability / unsatisfiability transition for force transmission can be located by measuring the width of the force distributions @xmath121 .",
    "the location of this transition , in turn , constitutes a lower bound for the possible coordination number @xmath4 , which extends maxwell s counting argument for @xmath30 to any friction .",
    "an additional quantity available is the force distribution itself , as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , our approach explicitly relates two essential properties of the jamming transition : the average coordination number and the force distribution .      as discussed in the previous section , satisfiability of force",

    "<S> both of them describe the exponential decay at large force and a power law behavior @xmath11 for small forces  @xcite . however , the exponent @xmath12 obtained by the q - model ( an integer @xmath13  @xcite ) is larger than the one obtained by recent numerical simulations accessing the low force limit with increasing accuracy @xmath14  @xcite , while the exponent obtained by edwards model @xmath15 depends strongly on the dimension ( through @xmath16 ) , when simulations show it does not  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a recent replica calculation finds an exponent @xmath17 in infinite dimensions of space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other theoretical approaches based on entropy maximization similar to edwards statistical mechanics  @xcite also recover the large force exponential decay  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of those works which simulated the force network ensemble  @xcite on strongly hyperstatic @xmath18 triangular lattice  @xcite and on 2-d ( 3-d ) disordered hyperstatic frictionless bead packings generated using molecular dynamics  @xcite however predict a force distribution that decays faster than exponential , and so does a mean - field theory based on replica theory of spin glasses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements in the bulk of packings  @xcite find downward curvature on semi - log plot of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the average coordination number per particle @xmath16 is another key signature of jamming . </S>",
    "<S> close to jamming , many observables ( pressure , volume fraction , shear modulus or viscosity  @xcite to name a few ) scale with the distance @xmath19 to the average coordination number @xmath20 at the transition . understanding the value of @xmath20 is thus of primary importance . </S>",
    "<S> the case of frictionless spheres , for which , @xmath21 where @xmath7 is the dimension , has been rationalized based on counting arguments leading to the isostatic conjecture  @xcite : a lower bound @xmath22 is provided by maxwell s stability argument  @xcite , and an upper bound @xmath23 is given by the geometric constraint of having the particles exactly at contact , without overlap . </S>",
    "<S> the problem , however , turns out to be more complicated when friction is considered , and no method is known so far to predict @xmath20 in such a case . </S>",
    "<S> the ( naive ) generalization of the counting arguments gives the bounds @xmath24 in frictional packings , independently of the value of the interparticle friction coefficient @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , there is a range of @xmath20 obtained numerically and experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for small @xmath5 , this range never extends to the predicted lower bound , as packings with low friction coefficient lie close to @xmath25 .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present a theoretical framework at a mean - field level to consider force transmission as a constraint optimization problem on random graphs , and study this problem with standard tools , namely the cavity method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first obtain the force distribution for spheres , in frictionless and frictional cases , both in two and three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> besides showing the experimentally known approximate exponential fall - off at large forces , these distributions bring a new insight in the much less known small force regime . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we find for frictionless spheres in both 2 and 3 dimensions a finite value for @xmath26 in @xmath27 , leading to a mean - field exponent @xmath28 for small forces .    </S>",
    "<S> our framework is also the first one to show theoretically how the frictional coefficient @xmath5 affects the average number of contacting neighbors @xmath20 at the jamming transition , and we find a lower bound @xmath4 for this number ( which is also a lower bound on @xmath16 , since @xmath29 in a packing ) . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve this by generalizing in a careful way the naive maxwell counting arguments , considering the satisfiability of force and torque balances equations . </S>",
    "<S> linking @xmath20 to the behavior of force and torque balances is not a new idea , as it was already suggested by silbert _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the generalized isostaticity picture  @xcite gives a bound on the number of fully mobilized forces ( _ ie _ the number of tangential forces which are taking the maximally value allowed by the coulomb law ) based on the value of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of these works derive a bound for @xmath20 itself , at a given @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the bound @xmath4 that we obtain interpolates smoothly between the two isostatic limits at @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>"
