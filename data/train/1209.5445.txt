    "several changes in behavior are observed when @xmath149 .",
    "first , we see that the singlet probability is nearly unaffected when @xmath12 is very small .",
    "it then peaks at a value of 1 , and finally falls below the ( solid black ) @xmath150 curve at higher fields .",
    "the fact that the valley in @xmath2 is nearly unaffected for very small @xmath12 values is easy to understand . in this range",
    ", @xmath133 is also very small , so the exchange interaction is the dominant term for determining the ground state .",
    "the same is true when @xmath150 ; hence @xmath2 is unaffected .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 peaks at 1 is also easy to understand .",
    "we have previously noted that qubit 2 experiences an effective magnetic field @xmath92 due to the exchange interaction .",
    "@xmath92=0 close to the critical point @xmath12=0 , but away from the critical point , this effective field points in the opposite direction of the physical field . for some value of @xmath12 , the two fields can cancel each other .",
    "this cancellation occurs in the noncritical regime unless @xmath135 is too large .",
    "the effective system is then simply exchange - coupled double - dot probe in effectively zero magnetic field .",
    "therefore the ground state corresponds precisely to the singlet state of the probe . as consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig:6_disorder](b ) , the value of @xmath12 needed for this cancellation decreases , for larger values of @xmath135 . since the maximum value of @xmath2 increases to 1 in this scenario , it seems that small local variations in the magnetic field could actually make it easier to observe a qpt .",
    "in summary , we have shown that qpts in a quantum dot spin chain cause non - analytic behavior in the entanglement between external qubits , in the form of local or nonlocal probes , and we have argued that there are important practical benefits for using a local probe . based on our analysis of the local probe",
    ", we have proposed an experiment to observe a qpt in a single quantum dot spin , where the ground state changes character abruptly as a function of magnetic field .",
    "the experiment uses a triple quantum dot , and we have shown that the requirements are realistic , even taking into account finite temperature and local field fluctuations .",
    "we have found that qpts can be observed in other types of spin chains ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath0 ) using a local probe , although we do not describe those results here .",
    "we therefore believe that the local probe could be very useful for investigating entanglement in many quantum dot geometries , because of the practicality of performing singlet projection measurements .",
