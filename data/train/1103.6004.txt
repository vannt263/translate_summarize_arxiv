    "a mixture of particles including neutral srf is ejected from the target and thermalizes to 4k after sufficient collisions with the helium buffer gas .",
    "a 3 mm diameter exit aperture on the cell wall directly opposite the helium inlet is used to form the molecular beam .",

    "2.5 cm downstream from the cell , a coconut - charcoal covered copper plate with a 6.25 mm diameter hole collimates the srf beam while also limiting the flow of helium into the rest of the apparatus .",
    "the beam then exits the cryostat where it is further collimated by a @xmath132 mm@xmath133 aperture , resulting in an rms transverse velocity spread @xmath134 m / s .",

    "once optical cycling is achieved in a system , the application of laser beams in opposite directions can lead to substantial cooling forces .",
    "the simplest of these is the doppler force , where the doppler shift of a moving molecule brings it closer to or further from resonance with the laser .",
    "molecules closer to resonance scatter more photons , leading to a velocity - dependent force , @xmath140 .",
    "the doppler force affects molecules with velocities such that the doppler shift , @xmath141 , is not greater than the natural linewidth @xmath63 , where @xmath142 .",
    "this leads to an effective velocity range for the doppler force given by : @xmath143 m / s .",
    "molecules with larger velocities than @xmath144 experience a reduced force .    in systems with dark zeeman sublevels , such as the srf and @xmath86 systems presented in the main text , optical cycling ceases as soon as the molecules are pumped into these dark states .",

    "the applied magnetic field must be large enough that the molecules evolve out of the dark states quickly , but it must not be so large that they precess out of the bright states before they can absorb a photon .",
    "an estimate for the optimal @xmath42 field for doppler cooling , @xmath145 , can be made by equating the larmor precession frequency , @xmath146 , and the linewidth of the transition @xmath63 , where @xmath147 is the bohr magneton ( the magnetic moment of srf ) and @xmath148 is the land@xmath149 g factor for each hyperfine level . in srf ,",

    "in contrast to the sisyphus mechanism , red detuning produces doppler cooling , while blue detuning produces doppler heating . furthermore , the doppler cooling / heating forces extend over much larger transverse velocities than the sisyphus forces .",

    "we have used the value of @xmath178 obtained from the @xmath86 calculation . in the calculation the fraction of dark states ( in the absence of the remixing @xmath42-field ) is larger than in the real srf system ; hence we take the value of @xmath178 observed in the calculations as an upper limit on the value in our experimental system . to estimate the temperature of the sisyphus cooled beam , we assume that the sisyphus cooling occurs only over the last third of the cooling region ( where the standing waves are most pronounced ) .",
    "we then adjust the magnitude of the force by an overall factor @xmath179 until the simulation matches the experimental lif profile .",
    "examples of these simulations are shown in supplementary fig .",

    "this value is likely larger than in the actual srf system as shown by our estimation , so we expect that this calculation tends to overestimate @xmath41 . using this simulation we find @xmath110k .",
    "however , because the full srf system was not used to calculate the force used in the simulation , we derive a bound for the maximum value of @xmath41 by making two overly conservative assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the cooling force only occurs over a 1 cm length at the beginning of the interaction region .",
    "second , we allow @xmath181 to be larger than the value found from either the @xmath86 calculation or our estimation . we then find the largest value of @xmath181 which still replicates the experimental data under variation of @xmath179 . under these very conservative assumptions",
    "we estimate @xmath182 mk for @xmath183 m / s .",
    "this value is significantly larger than either @xmath184 m / s from our estimation , or @xmath185 m / s from the @xmath86 calculation .    in the doppler regime ,",
    "we assume a uniform cooling force @xmath186 over the whole interaction region and molecular beam velocity distribution .",
    "the overall magnitude of the force is adjusted until the simulated molecular beam width matches the width of the experimental lif profile . with this method",
    "we find @xmath112 mk . we also estimate a conservative upper limit by assuming this cooling force is only applied over a 1 cm length in the beginning of the cooling region ; from this we find @xmath113 mk .",
    "if we use the more realistic force vs. velocity curve shown in supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] c rather than @xmath186 we obtain similar temperature estimates , and slightly better agreement between the simulation and the data . specifically , inclusion of the residual sisyphus force in the doppler force curve reproduces the small sharp feature in the center of the molecular beam in fig .",

    "we have also performed calculations for a system with lower states @xmath187 and @xmath188 excited to a single @xmath189 upper state driven by two laser frequencies . in this calculation",
    "we assume that each laser only drives population from the nearest @xmath29 level .",

    "[ fig7]b , the doppler cooling force increases linearly with power until it becomes saturated .",
    "this type of behavior is expected for doppler cooling because at low powers the doppler force varies as the photon scattering rate which is linear with power . at higher powers , the photon scattering rate saturates because it is limited by the spontaneous emission rate , and larger excitation rates do not lead to larger photon scattering rates .    the sisyphus cooling force , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , however , does not appear to saturate .",

    "<S> an atom must have a closed cycling transition in which each photon absorption is always followed by spontaneous decay back to the initial state .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately there are no completely closed transitions in any real physical systems , and inevitably spontaneous decays to other states occur , usually before ultracold temperatures can be reached . </S>",
    "<S> each additional populated level requires a `` repump '' laser to return population back into the main cycle , so that photon scattering can continue . </S>",
    "<S> cycling transitions requiring one or two `` repump '' lasers are common in atomic systems , but they are quite difficult to find in molecules because of their vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom . </S>",

    "<S> we have chosen srf primarily because its favorable fcf s dictate that only three vibrational levels will be significantly populated after @xmath12 photon scatters @xcite , in principle more than sufficient for stopping molecules in our cryogenic beam . </S>",
    "<S> rotational branching is eliminated by driving an @xmath13 type transition @xcite , where the prime indicates the excited state . </S>",

    "<S> all relevant quantities ( detunings , larmor frequencies , rabi frequencies , @xmath63 ) are the same within factors of order unity , so the full 44 level system , driven by twelve laser frequencies , each interacting with multiple levels , must be solved . </S>",
    "<S> such a calculation is beyond the scope of this work ; however , the main features we have observed are common to any system with magnetically remixed dark sublevels driven by a standing wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest such system is an @xmath64 transition driven by a single laser frequency , and it provides substantial insight into our observations . a linearly polarized , blue ( red ) detuned laser of wavelength @xmath65 produces an ac stark shift which attracts ( repels ) the @xmath66 and @xmath67 levels , while the @xmath68 levels are unperturbed by the light field to first order , as shown schematically in the supplemental information . in a standing wave , the @xmath69 level undergoes a spatially periodic ac stark shift with period @xmath70 . for blue ( red ) detuning , </S>",
    "<S> molecules ride up a potential hill in this level , losing ( gaining ) kinetic energy , before they are pumped at a rate @xmath71 into the @xmath68 sublevels which are dark . </S>",
    "<S> if a @xmath42-field is applied at @xmath72 then the molecules precess from the dark @xmath73 sublevels back into @xmath74 at the nodes of the standing wave at a rate @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the sisyphus force is maximized when @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ( see supplemental information ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 defines the effective velocity range of the sisyphus force . </S>",
    "<S> larger values of @xmath75 produce a much smaller sisyphus force because the molecules are pumped back and forth between bright and dark states at random points in the standing wave . because the molecules spend more time in the bright states the photon scattering rate is higher , and the doppler force is larger . </S>",
    "<S> simple arguments suggest that @xmath79 for maximum doppler cooling forces , and that doppler forces occur over a larger range of velocities @xmath80=4 m / s ( see supplemental information ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative discussion provides substantial insight into our observations . at low @xmath42 fields we expect to observe sisyphus forces , which are characterized by cooling ( heating ) for blue ( red ) detuning for molecules with low @xmath54 as observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b . at higher @xmath42 fields we expect to observe doppler forces , characterized by cooling ( heating ) for red ( blue ) detuning . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath81 , doppler cooling forces should affect the entire molecular beam as observed in the bottom panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . in the supplemental information we provide the argument for the estimate @xmath82 , which yields @xmath83 m / s </S>",
    "<S> this is much smaller than @xmath84 m / s , and is consistent with our observations .    </S>",
    "<S> of course neither regime can be characterized purely by either sisyphus or doppler forces . in the moderate @xmath42 regime residual sisyphus forces </S>",
    "<S> lead to a slight additional broadening ( narrowing ) in the low - velocity part of the distribution for red ( blue ) detuning . </S>",
    "<S> this residual narrowing is clear in the top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a , while the broadening is too small to observe in the bottom panel of fig . 2a . in the low @xmath42 regime </S>",
    "<S> residual doppler forces result in small heating ( cooling ) over a large range of velocities for blue ( red ) detuning . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to non - zero unstable ( stable ) velocities @xmath85 , where the net force is zero and population is depleted ( accumulates ) . </S>",
    "<S> these stable points @xmath85 are clear in the bottom panel of fig </S>",
    "<S> . 2b . in the top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b the unstable velocities are clearly depleted , and there is some residual doppler broadening in the wings of the molecular beam . </S>",
    "<S> although the arguments presented here derive from an @xmath86 example system , they are common to any @xmath87 system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the effects described here have been observed in several such atomic systems @xcite .    to clearly illustrate the @xmath42 field dependence of the cooling force , we show the magnetic field dependence of the cooling forces for a red detuned pump laser , @xmath35 , in fig.3a . as shown for very small b fields , the width of the molecular beam increases due to sisyphus heating effects . </S>",
    "<S> this increase is followed by a sharp decrease in the molecular beam width corresponding to doppler cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the molecular beam is quite insensitive to the magnetic field over a range of intermediate magnetic field amplitudes between 2 and 6 g. finally at magnetic fields higher than 6 g the doppler forces are reduced because the magnetic field artificially broadens the transitions , resulting in lower scattering rates , and lower doppler forces . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate values for @xmath75 in the supplemental information which yield @xmath88 g and @xmath89 g for the maximum sisyphus and doppler forces , in reasonable agreement with our observations . once again </S>",
    "<S> , detailed comparison would require the full solution of the optical bloch equations for our system .    </S>",
    "<S> as an example of the complex features present in this system , we show the frequency dependence of the width of the srf beam under doppler force - dominated conditions of @xmath43 g , for various pump laser detunings @xmath38 in fig.3b . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency dependence of the width is substantially more complicated than that of a typical 2-level system . as shown the force </S>",
    "<S> oscillates many times between heating and cooling for @xmath90 mhz @xmath91 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> however , this complicated structure is amenable to a simple interpretation . as the pump laser frequency </S>",
    "<S> is varied , the nearest laser frequency to each molecular transition oscillates between red - detuned ( cooling ) and blue - detuned ( heating ) with a variation that is nearly periodic in the sideband frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency dependence in the sisyphus regime , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c , is somewhat more complicated , but for small detunings @xmath92 mhz@xmath93 mhz the sisyphus force has the opposite sign as the doppler forces as expected . in the supplemental information we also show the power dependence of the sisyphus and doppler cooling forces which are both in reasonable agreement with expectations .     </S>",
    "<S> ( red ) , and with cooling lasers and main pump laser blue - detuned by @xmath94 ( blue ) for ( a ) @xmath95 , @xmath43 g , @xmath96 , and ( b ) @xmath97 mhz , @xmath98 g , @xmath99 . in ( a ) cooling ( heating ) of the beam is observed for red ( blue ) detuning ; both are in accordance with expectations for doppler forces . in ( b ) cooling ( heating ) is observed for blue ( red ) detuning , as is expected for sisyphus forces . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the total integrated signal is the same to within 5% . </S>",
    "<S> the blue - detuned curves systematically have the lowest total integrated signal , likely because some molecules have been been pushed outside the imaging region by the doppler heating force . </S>",
    "<S> we observe qualitatively similar behavior in both cases for pump laser modulation frequencies @xmath100 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> however the @xmath52 values shown here were chosen because they produced the clearest doppler and sisyphus effects . </S>",
    "<S> this plot shows raw data , with no rescaling applied . </S>",

    "<S> g the beam is broader due to sisyphus forces . at approximately </S>",
    "<S> @xmath104 g we see a sharp transition between sisyphus dominated heating forces , and doppler dominated cooling forces . for @xmath105 g the width increases as described in the main text . </S>",
    "<S> frequency dependence of the cooling forces under b ) doppler ( @xmath43 g ) and c ) sisyphus ( @xmath98 g ) dominated conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines between data points are drawn as a guide to the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical dashed lines are spaced by the sideband frequency of a ) 46.4 mhz and b ) 43.2 mhz , and illustrate the dependence of the oscillations on sideband frequency . describing the molecular beam simply by a width </S>",
    "<S> is potentially problematic in the sisyphus dominated regime where more than one velocity class are present . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless the total width of the beam for the red ( blue ) detuned pump laser is larger ( smaller ) than the unperturbed beam width , and thus the width provides a reasonable description of the molecular beam . the asymmetry around @xmath106 in b ) and </S>",
    "<S> c ) underscores the complex nature of this system and is likely representative of the fact that every sideband does not have the same detuning from the nearest transition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the detuning of each sideband from the nearest transition is not zero for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the absolute values of the individual sideband detunings are not the same for @xmath107 and @xmath108.,width=336 ]    finally , we discuss our determination of the temperature @xmath41 of the molecules after they are cooled . </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed beam is constrained by collimating apertures to have @xmath109 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the long interaction region prevents a precise determination of @xmath41 for the cooled beam , because the beam continues to expand as it experiences an imperfectly known distribution of cooling forces throughout the interaction region . to estimate @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the molecular beam profile using a monte carlo simulation of classical particles subjected to the qualitatively expected force vs. velocity profile ( see supplemental information ) . using these simulations we find @xmath110k for the sisyphus regime in the top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate a conservative upper limit on the temperature of @xmath111 mk .    </S>",
    "<S> for the doppler regime , we find that @xmath112 mk , and @xmath113 mk . </S>",
    "<S> these values of @xmath41 for the doppler regime are consistent with the final temperature expected if the molecules are subjected to @xmath114 photon scatters . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath115 agrees with expectations based on the previously observed scattering rate for this system and roughly known interaction time . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the total integrated signal of the doppler - cooled beam and the unperturbed beam are the same to within the level of experimental reproducibility @xmath116 , indicating that our cycling scheme is highly closed .    </S>",
    "<S> our results have immediate implications for a number of future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the 1d cooling and optical cycling demonstrated here could dramatically improve the statistical sensitivity of searches for electron electric dipole and nuclear anapole moments @xcite , by providing more collimated molecular beams and enhanced detection efficiency in these experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the combination of 1d cooling and a highly closed cycling transition opens the door to laser cooling of molecules in 3d . </S>",
    "<S> given the calculated fcf s , a large fraction of molecules should scatter the @xmath117 photons necessary to bring a beam of srf to a stop , and subsequently load the molecules into a trap . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the experimentally determined loss rate of molecules in this system is @xmath118 for @xmath1191000 , implying that @xmath120 can be brought to rest , given sufficient interaction time . </S>",
    "<S> the laser cooling techniques presented here are limited , from a practical standpoint , to those molecules which have closed electronic transitions with diagonal fcfs and therefore require relatively few lasers . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason these techniques are applicable only to a small fraction of diatomic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> however because the set of diatomic molecules is very large , this subset contains a significant number of molecules@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are aware of perhaps a dozen diatomic molecules with a wide range of internal structures that appear amenable to laser cooling with similar methods . </S>",
    "<S> laser cooling such molecules to ultracold temperatures would open the door to the study of a wide variety of new physical phenomena .    </S>",
