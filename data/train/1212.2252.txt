    "since the concept of stellar populations was invented @xcite , stellar population synthesis ( sps ) has been proven to be a useful tool for revealing clues about galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "research on several crucial factors of stellar modelling , like convection , opacity , heavy - element mixing , helium content , and mass loss @xcite , resulted in increasingly accurate sps models @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "estimation of single burst equivalent age and metallicity , was accomplished by comparing integrated light of observed galaxy with that of sps models . however , most of the colours and absorption feature strength appear identical if the changes of age and metallicity satisfy @xmath2 .",
    "this so - called age - metallicity degeneracy @xcite blocks the way to estimating galaxy accurate ages from optical broad band colours . at spectroscopically narrow bands , however , several age sensitive or metallicity sensitive lick indices",
    "@xcite , taken in pairs , are effective at breaking this degeneracy .",
    "balmer indices vs. fe - peak indices are widely used , for example , because they are relatively easy to observe ( all features are in the optical so one spectrograph can cover them all ) and the model grids in the observed index - index space open up to nearly orthogonal grids rather than collapsed into linear , degenerate overlapping segments .",
    "spectroscopy is effective , but photometry also has its strong points .",
    "it is much more efficient for faint objects and low surface brightness galaxies . in the epoch of large sky surveys , like _ sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , spitzer space telescope ( sst ) , large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) _ , and _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ , photometry is undoubtedly more feasible than spectrometry .",
    "in fact , optical near - infrared ( near - ir ) colours have been exploited to possibly constrain age and metallicity by several studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested ( @xmath3 ) colour shows good balance between parameter degeneracy and sensitivity .",
    "@xcite found that four age intervals ( @xmath410 gyr , 2@xmath59 gyr , 1@xmath52 gyr , and 0.2@xmath51 gyr ) are clearly separated in the optical near - ir colour - colour plot .",
    "these results hinge upon the models , and specifically upon the number of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars , which dominate near - ir light between 0.3 and 2 gyr of age @xcite .",
    "the present work looks for age - sensitive or metallicity - sensitive indices in three photometric systems : david dunlap observatory ( ddo , @xcite ) , beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc , @xcite ) , and strmgren  @xcite systems .",
    "these filters are narrower in wavelength than johnson - cousins broad band filters , but resemble the _ nircam _ narrow filters on board _",
    "jwst_. can we find indices which are practical to break the age - metallicity degeneracy ?",
    "the tables and graphs in @xmath6 [ sub : three ] explore this issue . in addition , equipped with the latest stellar evolutionary isochrones of the padova group ( @xcite , hereafter b09 ) , we plot the model grids in ( @xmath7 ) vs. ( @xmath3 ) space , and compare with previous models in @xmath6 [ sub : bvk ] . observables from three samples are chosen to verify the credibility of parameters given by the model grids .",
    "discrepancies between two model grids are briefly discussed in @xmath6 [ sect : disc ] , and a brief summary of the results and outlook for the future is given in @xmath6 [ sect : sum ] .",
    "in order to find the age - sensitive or metallicity - sensitive index , we calculate the the metallicity - to - age sensitivity parameter ( @xmath8 ) using the evolving ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter w94 ) models , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectral library is synthetic and is sensitive to individual elemental abundances in the 300 to 1000 nm wavelength range .",
    "the metallicity sensitivity parameter is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the metallicity partial derivative of the index at 8 gyr , and @xmath11 is the age partial derivative of the index at solar metallicity .",
    "thus , @xmath12 is the metallicity sensitivity at 8 gyr , solar metallicity .",
    "@xmath12 is surveyed for indices in three photometric systems .",
    "we refer the readers to related papers for detailed description of filters and indices ( see @xmath6[sect : intro ] ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , indices with @xmath12 close to 1.5 are less likely to break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "hence , indices with extreme @xmath12 values are selected as candidates and listed in table [ tab : ss]k , batc6075@xmath5k , were also examined . however , no promising index is found . ] . what is not quantified in table [ tab : ss ]",
    "is the dynamic range ( compared to observational error ) of a given index , and the dynamic range is low in ddo c(41 - 42 ) , alas .",

    ", we increase the stellar atmosphere model abundances of six major elements ( c , n , o , na , mg , fe ) by 0.3 dex , one single element at a time .",
    "the sensitivity is modeled only in the stellar library ; the isochrones are kept as published .",
    "table [ tab : eh ] outlines the index changes at 8 gyr , solar metallicity .    * the prominent carbon and nitrogen effect on ddo c(41 - 42 ) colour is not surprising , since the ddo 41 band overlaps cn@xmath13 and cn@xmath14 lick indices in wavelength .",
    "fe and cn absorption lines are the main features under 4000  , which explains the ddo c(35 - 48 ) colour changes at super - solar c , n , and fe abundances . the behavior of increased o is opposite due to molecular balancing : the co molecule has the strongest binding energy and so adding o decreases the c supply , weakening c@xmath14 and cn features .",
    "thus , adding more o causes bluer ddo c(41 - 42 ) and c(35 - 38 ) colours .",
    "* the batc 6075 - 6660 and 5795 - 6075 colours are relatively unaffected by six major elements , which makes them good colours to study systems with unknown element enhancements .",

    "the trend of the @xmath0 $ ] index change due to c and o abundance variations is reverse compared to other indices .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands are both blanketed by cn absorption lines , our models predict that the impact of cn on the @xmath16 band is greater than that on the @xmath15 band .",

    "another unexpected change is about the isochrone of the youngest age , 100 myr : the ( @xmath3 ) colour of the lowest metallicity ( @xmath23 ) is even redder that of the highest metallicity ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "three reasons are hypothesized for these outliers : first , the conversion relations between _ uz , vz , bz , yz _ and _ uvby _ system presented in @xcite are empirical , which inevitably increases the uncertainty ; second , the dynamic range of @xmath0 $ ] index is not large compared to the observational error ; third , isochrones of age between 5 and 17 gyr are partially degenerate , which reduces the span of model grids .",
    "the model isochrone of 100 myr lies low in the @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] plot .",

    "since b94 and b09 models mainly differ in tp - agb model treatments , which affect the near - ir colour seriously between 0.3 and 2 gyr @xcite , it is suggested different treatments of tp - agb stars are responsible for the changes of model grids .",

    "the scarcity of very low metallicity agb stars around solar neighbourhood impedes empirical calibration .",
    "it is reasonable to suggest closer scrutiny for ssps with extremely low metallicities around 1 and 2 gyr .",
    "another unexpected feature in figure [ fig : pad11 ] is the twist of the 100 myr isochrone .",
    "this youngest isochrone is unique : the ( @xmath3 ) colour at the lowest metallicity is redder than that of the highest metallicity .",
    "this is inconsistent with the usual sense that metal - rich ssps are redder than metal - poor ssps ( see the 100 myr isochrone of figure [ fig : pad94 ] ) .",

    "thus , these features are dependent upon near - ir band ( @xmath40 ) , instead of visible bands ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) .",
    "considering the tp - agb treament differences of b94 and b09 models and the tp - agb effects on @xmath40 band , it is again suggested tp - agb stars are responsible for the changes of young ssp isochrones ( @xmath43 gyr ) , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite    ) vs. ( @xmath39 ) plot of b94 and b09 models .",
