    "moreover , coulomb blockade phenomena , the kondo effect , and tomonaga - luttinger liquid properties have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "such measurements confirm the relevance of electron correlations effects in swnts at low energies as predicted in earlier theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "recently , suspended nanotubes have been fabricated , and the transport properties have been measured by several groups @xcite . since the suspended nanotube is free from the substrate , it is expected that it can easily vibrate @xcite . at the same time",
    ", some theoretical works have started to investigate the effects of the mechanical motion on the electronic transport properties of interacting swnts @xcite . while ref .",
    "@xcite focus on coulomb blockade phenomena , the swnt is treated as a tomonaga - luttinger liquid @xcite with periodic boundary conditions ( valid for very long nanotubes ) in ref .",
    ". however , typical swnt lengths are of the order of sub - micron to micro - meters , yielding a mean level spacing for the electronic energy levels in the @xmath6 energy range .",
    "this discreteness of the energy levels can be clearly seen in low temperature measurements , e.g. by measuring the excitation spectrum of a swnt quantum dot @xcite . in finite length swnts , the quantized nature of the vibrational modes of a swnt",
    "should be considered as well at low enough energies .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of the mechanical vibrations on the electronic properties of a doubly clamped swnt of finite length within a full quantum mechanical treatment of the low energy excitations .",
    "even if the metallic condition @xmath0 is satisfied , small energy gaps @xmath7 appear due to curvature effects .",
    "the armchair nanotubes ( @xmath8 ) , however , still stay metallic because of their high symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider the armchair swnts in this paper .",
    "the interacting electrons in the nanotubes are considered within the standard bosonization framework of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid model with open boundary conditions @xcite , where the electronic excitations ( charged and neutral plasmons ) have bosonic character .",
    "the low energy vibrations of the nanotube can be described in terms of acoustic phonons , associated to the longitudinal stretching mode and to the transverse twisting and breathing modes @xcite .",
    "the coupling between electron and phonons is described in terms of the deformation potential caused by the acoustic modes . in our model",
    "this yields a bilinear bosonic coupling between phonons and plasmons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the acoustic modes have been treated within a continuous elastic model , and have been integrated out in order to obtain a phonon - mediated retarded electron - electron interaction .",
    "it was shown that while the twisting mode can be neglected at low energies , the effect of the breathing mode and stretching modes should be considered . in particular , retardation effects of the breathing mode can be neglected , and an effective renormalization of the electron - electron interaction strength is found with possibly attractive interactions .",
    "in contrast , retardation effects due to the stretching mode must be retained , so that , due to the combined effects of stretching and breathing modes , the wentzel - bardeen singularity , describing a superconducting instability of the electron - phonon system @xcite , can be reached . in this paper , we consider the case in which electron _ as well as _ phonon modes are quantized , and look to the energy spectrum of the interacting electron - phonon system . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the major effect of the breathing mode is to renormalize the electron - electron interaction strength . on the other hand",
    "the electronic as well as the stretching - phonons parameters get renormalized by the mutual interaction , yielding `` electron''-like and `` stretching - phonons''-like excitations .",
    "such electron - like excited levels appear as large peaks in the differential conductance , while stretching - phonon - like assisted processes appear as small peaks beside the large peaks .",
    "the phonon peak height is very sensitive to the system parameters , and it becomes larger and larger when the value of the charged plasmons velocity is close to the sound velocity , i.e. when the wentzel - bardeen instability @xcite is approached .",
    "thus , the experimental observation of the phonon peak would be an indication of the strong fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter , which corresponds to the wentzel - bardeen singularity , in swnts . at temperatures higher than the level spacing",
    ", the discreteness of the peaks is washed out .",
    "the differential conductance then shows the characteristic tomonaga - luttinger power - law dependence on voltage , with exponents modified by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "to start with , we consider a suspended , doubly clamped metallic swnt whose fixed ends are at @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we wish to develop a low energy theory for suspended metallic swnts , and restrict ourselves to the two lowest linear in @xmath11 electronic subbands .",
    "moreover , in experiments the nanotubes are typically intrinsically @xmath12-doped such that the fermi level is shifted away from half - filling .",
    "long - range coulomb interaction is dominant in isolated swnts , because the electrons are spread out around the circumference of the tube , and the probability of two electrons to be near to each other is of the order @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of atoms on the circumference .",
    "the interaction is usually screened on a length determined either by the tube length or by the distance to nearby gates .",
    "the coulomb interaction causes umklapp , backward and forward scattering processes among the electrons .",
    "away from half - filling umklapp scattering can be neglected .",
    "we also disregard backscattering processes , which is a valid approximation if the tube radius is not too small @xcite .",

    "the excitations propagate with renormalized velocity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the interaction parameter for the @xmath35-sector . because the coulomb interaction describes an interaction among total electronic densities , only the total charge sector is affected while the other sectors are neutral sectors , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , respectively .",
    "hereafter we denote @xmath39 and we call @xmath40 the charge sector simply .",

    "it can be estimated to be @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a typical swnt length , and @xmath47 is the distance to a possibly present gate electrode .",
    "the interaction parameter is estimated to be @xmath48 for @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the screening caused by a gate electrode nearby the nanotube is typically more effective in screening , which pushes @xmath50 closer to the non - interacting value , @xmath51 .",
    "we consider next the effects of the vibrations .",
    "the relevant phonon modes at low energies are those for which the quantized ( due to the periodic boundary conditions in the circumference direction ) transverse momentum is zero .",
    "there are three modes : stretching , twisting and breathing modes . in terms of the deformation potential",
    ", the transverse - acoustic twisting mode does not contribute at first order in the displacement @xcite , so that it will no longer be considered in the rest of this work .",
    "the transverse acoustic breathing mode has a finite frequency @xmath52 , of the order of @xmath53 in the long wavelength limit .",
    "the energy scale is thus larger than that of the low energy electrons in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "however , as we shall discuss later , this mode strongly renormalizes the energy of the charge sector . in the following , we start by explicitly considering the effects of the coupling to the longitudinal stretching mode .",
    "we start from a continuum model for the vibrations @xcite , such that the stretching mode corresponds to the longitudinal acoustic mode of the one - dimensional continuum . at a second stage of the calculation also",
    "the effect of the breathing mode will be discussed .",

    "before we proceed , let us discuss the relation between the coupling constant @xmath57 of our one - dimensional model and the three - dimensional nature of the electron - phonon coupling in swnts .",
    "for a swnt the electron - phonon interaction is written as @xcite @xmath62 where the @xmath63 axis is along the circumference , @xmath64 is the density of electrons and @xmath65 is the deformation potential . for the stretching phonon mode",
    "@xmath66 has no @xmath63-dependence . here",
    "@xmath67 is the displacement field , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the bulk modulus , shear modulus and deformation potential for a graphene sheet , respectively .",
    "therefore , with @xmath71 , we have the relation @xmath72 .",
    "since we want to investigate transport properties of the coupled electron - phonon system in a tube of finite length @xmath25 , we employ open boundary conditions for the electrons , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 @xcite . for the phonon field",
    "we have similar boundary conditions , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the discreteness of the phonon and electron spectrum in a finite length swnt is better visualized by expanding each field operator in fourier series as @xmath77 here @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators of the @xmath35-sector s bosons , satisfying @xmath80=\\delta_{jj^ { ' } } \\delta_{nn^{'}}$ ] , and @xmath81 is the wave number .",
    "similar expansions hold for @xmath60 and @xmath59 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the phonon mode obeying the commutation relation @xmath85=\\delta_{nn^{'}}$ ] . using these relations",
    "we get @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the discrete excitation energy for the @xmath35-sector , while @xmath88 for the phonons . finally , @xmath89 is the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction term ( [ eq : h_el - ph_boson ] ) reflects the fact that the phonons couple only to the total charge density via the deformation potential .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath90 is bi - linear in the boson operators characterizing the electronic and phonon excitations , and as such it can be exactly diagonalized with a bogoliubov transformation ( see appendix ) .",
    "the diagonalized hamiltonian is , @xmath91 where @xmath92 comes from the branch of the charge density / phonon , defined by , @xmath93 here we assumed the relation @xmath94 , as it holds for carbon nanotubes .",
    "the summation @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_tot_dia ] ) is for the neutral sectors @xmath96 .",
    "we notice that for electron - phonon couplings @xmath97 the energy @xmath98 vanishes . for even larger couplings @xmath98 becomes complex which is an unphysical situation .",
    "thus we require that @xmath99 , where the equality sign defines the wentzel - bardeen singularity .",
    "we notice that also the diagonalized energies have a linear dispersion relation .",
    "hereafter we use the index @xmath100 for the three kinds of bosonic excitations , and set @xmath101 .",
    "let us now also include the effects of the breathing mode .",
    "a quantitative estimate of these effects is discussed in @xcite , where the authors evaluate the effective retarded electronic action obtained upon integrating out the phonon stretching and breathing modes .",
    "it turns out that retardation effects can be disregarded for the breathing but not for the stretching mode .",
    "thus the breathing mode yields a renormalization of the velocity associated to the charged plasmon mode as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite . with @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and",
    "interaction parameter @xmath107 the charge velocity @xmath108 becomes _ comparable _ to the sound velocity @xmath109 of the stretching mode if @xmath110 .",
    "this can not occur , not even for the smallest swnt radii .",
    "however , the renormalized charge velocity might become of the order of the sound velocity @xmath56 for realistic nanotube radii for strongly screened interaction ( yielding values of @xmath50 close to one ) .",
    "the breathing mode also yields a renormalization of the electron - electron interaction parameter as @xmath111 .",
    "this results in the increase of the electron - phonon coupling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_el - ph_boson ] ) with @xmath112 . in the following",
    ", we shall then consider breathing - mode renormalized parameters , with a parameter @xmath113 ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath114 ( @xmath51 ) as for a realistic @xmath115 tube .",
    "we notice that also umklapp scattering processes should reduce the charge velocity @xcite",
    ". this effect would be dominant near half - filling , where a strong coupling with the stretching mode is expected @xcite .",
    "moreover , a suppression of the electron - phonon coupling is expected at half - filling @xcite .",
    "this situation has not been considered in our calculation , since swnts are usually away from half - filling @xcite .",
    "with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_tot_dia ] ) we can now evaluate the density of states @xmath116 .",
    "in particular , we shall focus on the density of states at a nanotube end @xmath117 , yielding direct information on the differential conductance .",
    "the density of states is calculated by expressing the electron field operators in terms of the boson operators @xcite .",
    "after lengthy but standard calculations , see appendix , we arrive at the following finite temperature density of states at the end of the nanotube : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the index for the positive and negative energy region , @xmath120 , @xmath121 are the band and spin indices , the summations @xmath122 run on all integers . @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where @xmath125 for @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "when the temperature is much lower than the level spacings , @xmath127 , the coefficients @xmath128 are written as @xmath129 here @xmath130 is the gamma function and @xmath131 is the step function .",

    "the phase @xmath135 is defined by @xmath136 .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : rho_fl ] ) , one sees that at low temperatures a signature of the finite length of the swnt appears in the form of discrete peaks in the density of states .",
    "more precisely , three peak families with distinct periods are identified , cf .",
