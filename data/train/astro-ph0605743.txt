    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are a class of close binary system , with a typical orbital period of a few hours , where a white dwarf primary accretes material from its companion via roche lobe overflow .",
    "the secondary is normally a late - type main sequence star although examples with an evolved companion do exist ( eg . gk  per ) . in the absence of a significant white dwarf magnetic field , material arrives at the primary after processing though an accretion disc .",
    "the dwarf nova subgroup show outbursts where the luminosity of the system increases by around 25  mag .",
    "although not strictily periodic , these recur on a typical timescale for each system ranging from tens of days to tens of years .",
    "the dwarf novae are further subdivided based on the properties of the outbursts .",
    "we will be interested in the su  uma type where the systems show occassional superoutbursts which have a brighter maximum ( @xmath0  mag . ) and longer duration ( @xmath1  times ) than normal outbursts .",
    "the most favoured explanation for dwarf nova outbursts involves an ionization instability where the accretion disc mass increases until a critical surface density @xmath2 is reached at some radius @xmath3 .",
    "when this occurs , the disc switches into a `` hot '' state with higher viscosity that causes a larger mass transport rate through the disc and increased luminosity .",
    "the disc mass now steadily decreases until a second critical surface density @xmath4 is reached at some point . upon meeting this condition , the disc transfers back to the `` cold '' quiescent state and the cycle repeats . in these expressions @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameters in the cold and hot states respectively and the primary mass @xmath7 is measured in solar masses @xcite .",
    "su  uma superoutbursts also have the property of showing superhumps . here , an additional periodity ( @xmath8 ) a few percent longer than the orbital period ( @xmath9 ) is apparent in the lightcurve .",
    "this is believed to arise from a precessing , eccentric accretion disc driven by a resonance between the orbiting disc material and the secondary .",
    "cvs in general and the su  uma systems in particular are well - reviewed by @xcite .",
    "some systems other than dwarf novae also show superhumps which , by analogy , are believed to share a common origin with an eccentric disc now permanently present giving rise to `` permanent superhumps '' @xcite .",
    "similarly , some low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ; analogues to cvs where the primary is now a neutron star , have also been discovered to have superhumps eg .",
    "kv  uma @xcite .",
    "there is also a related phenomenon of `` negative '' superhumps which occur on a period a few percent _ shorter _ than @xmath9 .",
    "this is believed to arise from precession of a disc warp and we will not consider these in this paper .",
    "the intent of this paper is to test our understanding of the ( positive ) superhump phenomenon by comparing observation to the predictions of theoretical expressions for @xmath8 .",
    "since this is directly observable , if we can relate it to the funadmental parameters of a system , we will have a method to indirectly measure such parameters .",
    "@xcite derived the final precession rate @xmath10 for an eccentric disc as the sum of three terms : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dynamical precession frequency , @xmath13 is a pressure related term and @xmath14 is a transient term .",
    "this latter contribution is related to the time derivative of the mode giving rise to the dynamical precession .",
    "thus , it may be important in the development phase of the superhumps but not in steady state . as a result",
    ", we shall not consider it in detail except to note that it can have either sign and thus can either act to increase or decrease the precession rate .",
    "the dynamical term is the one arising from the resonance and is examined in section  [ sec : dynthry ] .",
    "the pressure term acts to slow the precession and it is summarised in section  [ sec : presthry ] .",
    "@xcite derived the general expression for the ratio of the dynamical disc precession @xmath12 and orbital @xmath15 frequencies in terms of the mass ratio and radius of disc material .",

    "this evaluates to @xmath21 where the coefficients are given by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the fixed value of @xmath23 enigmatically described as `` corrected for the presence of the companion '' and thus presumably in the limit of @xmath24 .",

    "the limiting mass ratio @xmath34 found by @xcite arises from the largest value for which @xmath35 remains within the last stable stream line @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations , however , still produce identifiable superhumps up to a mass ratio of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used an approximation for the disc tidal radius @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "when coupled to eggleton s formula @xcite for the primary s roche lobe radius @xmath39 and equated to the 3:2 resonance radius in equation  ( [ eqn : resrad ] ) , this gives a limiting mass ratio of @xmath40 , although this is sensitive to the choice of @xmath41 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this differs from the often cited value of @xmath42 quoted in that paper , as equation ( 5 ) there contains an incorrect power of @xmath29 .",
    "a slightly less _ ad hoc _ expression for the tidal radius comes from fitting to the simulations of @xcite @xmath43 equating this to equation  ( [ eqn : resrad ] ) gives a limiting mass ratio of @xmath44 which sets a maximum @xmath45 for a 3:2 resonance .",
    "@xcite showed that the pressure term can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the angular orbital frequency of a parcel of gas in the disc , @xmath48 is the radial wavenumber of the mode and @xmath49 is the gas sound speed .",
    "clearly the pressure term acts in the opposite , retrograde sense to the dynamical term . for a spiral wave",
    ", the pitch angle @xmath50 is related to @xmath48 by @xmath51 from the resonance condition ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* eqn . 3.37 )",
    ", we have @xmath52 which becomes , when @xmath53 , @xmath54 hence , for the 3:2 resonance @xmath55 . for the fixed radius @xmath23 ,",
    "@xcite corrected earlier errors to derive a contribution @xmath56 for our general case using ( [ eqn : ompapprox ] ) and where @xmath3 is given by equation  ( [ eqn : resrad ] ) , we have @xmath57 to proceed further , we need to understand the behaviour of the final dimensionless term in brackets . since values for @xmath49 and @xmath50 may vary according to the peculiar characteristics of any particular system , we will examine this in more detail in section  [ sec : presscomp ] .",
    "since there are relatively few systems with accurately measured values of @xmath29 , it is often convenient to make use of the theoretical relation @xmath61 @xcite that follows from the assumption that the secondary has a main sequence structure or an observationally derived equivalent @xmath62 @xcite . in both cases",
    "@xmath63 is measured in solar masses and @xmath9 in hours .      for different assumed values of @xmath7 we can plot theoretically predicted lines on the @xmath64@xmath9 plane . @xcite",
    "used equation  [ eqn : omrat ] with the fixed radius value given by @xcite to compare the observed distribution with theory in just this way .",
    "he concluded that `` superhumps observations _ can not _ be adequately explained in terms of purely dynamical precession '' .",
    "however , including the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath3 given in equation  [ eqn : omratfull ] leads us to a different conclusion .",
    "figure  [ fig : epsporb ] reproduces the comparison of @xcite using both methods .",
    "the lines are plotted for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this shows that the distribution is compatible with the boundary imposed by the condition @xmath68 when the full @xmath29 dependence is included .",
    "in fact , the most we can conclude is that the distribution of superhumping systems suggests that they have a primary mass higher than the general cv population .",
    "this would not be entirely suprising since to be a superhumping system requires a small mass ratio and will thus tend to select higher @xmath7 systems . also apparent",

    "@xmath64 decreases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the turn to lower @xmath64 at @xmath73 may arise from the secondary becoming degenerate and deviating from a main sequence structure as assumed for the theoretical curves . ]",
    "[ fig : epsporb ]    more convincing evidence for the need for a pressure related effect on the precession rate is provided by the data for @xmath64 and @xmath29 plotted in figure  [ fig : epsofq ] .",
    "the 11 systems on this plot are those used in @xcite .",
    "these have directly determined values of @xmath29 .",
    "the exception is oy  car which appears in fig .",
    "9 of that paper but not in the corresponding table  7 .",
    "we take the values for this system from @xcite .",
    "we can see that the data are certainly not compatible with the asumption of a 3:2 resonance .",
    "if anything , they cluster around the prediction for a 4:3 resonance , although given the way the resonances ` pile up ' one can argue that it is inevitable that some resonance would fall near the data .",
    "it is intriguing to note however , just how close the two most accurately measure values of @xmath29 for the systems xz  eri and dv  uma @xcite lie to the 4:3 theoretical line ( see figure  [ fig : epsofqzoom ] ) .",
    "it would thus be extremely interesting to see modelling using the method employed by these authors applied to the other eclipsing systems to determine similarly accurate values for @xmath29 .",
    "we summarise the @xmath74 value for the data against each resonance in table  [ tab : reschi2 ] and note the remarkable reduction in @xmath74 for the 4:3 model .",
    "if a purely dynamical 4:3 resonance were the correct model , the probability that the value of @xmath74 would exceed the measured value is 0.23 .    , and the dynamical precession rates of discs with radii calculated under different assumptions .",

    "since @xmath76 this would cause the pressure term to also shrink and thus the period excess to increase during an outburst .",
    "observationally , the opposite appears to be the case , with the period excess decreasing with time @xcite .",
    "the only available parameter to counter this is @xmath77 implying that the pitch angle @xmath50 increases during an outburst .",
    "although the treatment of @xcite includes the coupling of the tides , spiral waves and eccentricity , it shares the shortcoming of a purely dynamical resonance in that the properties are characterised by those at a single radius .",
    "a recent preprint of a paper by @xcite has addressed this problem with a detailed analysis solving the equations for the disc behaviour integrated over the whole range of disc radii .",
    "their final equation describing the generation , damping and dynamics of eccentricity in the disc is @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the complex eccentricity @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the local disc pressure and density , @xmath83 is a complex adiabatic exponent , @xmath84 is the eccentricity growth rate for a resonance at radius @xmath85 from @xcite and @xmath86 is the angular velocity of the orbiting disc material .",
    "unsuprisingly , the full solution has to be found numerically .",
    "these authors do so with undisturbed ( vertically integrated ) structure distributions given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the outer and inner radii disc radii and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the pressure and surface density at the scaling radius @xmath92 .",
    "considering the first bracketed terms in either case , the @xcite equations used above have the same radial dependence .",
    "the second bracketed terms reflect the behaviour close to the inner radius .",
    "the final terms were chosen to implement the boundary conditions at the outer edge of the disc . since we would expect the inner and outer terms to",
    "only become important close to the limiting mass ratios and given the similarity otherwise of the radial dependences of the equations to those used earlier , we do not need to repeat the integration here but compare the final results produced .",
    "the results in figure  8 of @xcite show a similar excursion to a negative period excess for small @xmath29 .",
    "the curves also turn up to high @xmath64 as they assymptotically approach @xmath93 which our expression does not produce .",
    "however , the turn off occurs very close to @xmath93 for the best fitting curve and the details of the behaviour here depend on the functional form chosen to implement the boundary conditions for the outer edge of the disc in equations ( [ eqn : pgood ] ) and ( [ eqn : sigmagood ] ) .",
    "away from the extreme mass ratios the two sets of results are very close .      in an attempt to calibrate an empirical relation between @xmath64 and @xmath29 , @xcite extended the earlier fit of @xmath94 @xcite to @xmath95 we can view these as phenomenologically derived equivalents to the maclaurin series for our analytic expression .",
    "given the complexity of the full expressions , however , rather than carry out the necessary differentiation , it is simplest to generate @xmath96 predictions from our formula numerically and then find the best fitting polynomial to these values using standard methods @xcite .",
    "this approach gives an approximate formula @xmath97 over the range @xmath98 .",
    "this expression differs both with a very small constant offset and with a quadratic term that causes a curvature in the opposite sense to the empirical expression .",
    "this can be attributed to removing the @xmath93 limitation imposed by u  gem for bb  dor . @xcite",
    "derive a best fit formula for their numerical integrations of ( [ eqn : goodeqn ] ) of @xmath99 these polynomial forms are compared graphically in figure  [ fig : empcomp ] .",

    "we have shown that the standard dynamical method of calculating the precession rate of superhumping cvs with a 3:2 provides such a poor fit to the data that a 4:3 resonance is actually a better fit ! we have confirmed the importance of including the pressure related term in the calculation of the precession rate @xcite which fits the data better than any pure resonance model .",
    "the pressure term has been reduced to a function of @xmath29 and the total , analytic precession rate shown to be equivalent to the empirically derived expressions of @xcite .",
    "these anayltic expressions also produce precession rates in good agreement with those from the detailed integrations carried out by @xcite .",
    "this formulation has been used to calculate values for @xmath29 in systems which would otherwise be unknown .",
