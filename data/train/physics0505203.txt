    "for locally isotropic turbulence , kolmogorov @xcite based his theory in 1941 on a hypothesis that small - scale statistics are uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity @xmath2 and the mean rate of energy dissipation @xmath3 .",
    "landau @xcite remarked as follows .",
    "the local rate of energy dissipation @xmath4 should fluctuate in space over scales of large eddies .",
    "this large - scale fluctuation should not be universal but should be different for different flows . since the large - scale fluctuation should affect small - scale statistics , there should be no universal law that describes the small - scale statistics .",
    "landau s remark has been wrongly regarded as a prediction for small - scale intermittency , i.e. , enhancement of a small - scale fluctuation in a fraction of the volume .",
    "this is because , when kolmogorov @xcite revised his theory in 1962 to incorporate small - scale intermittency , he gave too much credit to landau.@xcite for small scales , landau remarked not about intermittency but about universality .",
    "the small - scale statistics in landau s original remark are the second - order moments of velocity increments alone . here",
    "we extend landau s remark to consider the universality of other small - scale statistics .",
    "the importance of landau s remark is not only to small - scale statistics .",
    "any potentially significant phenomenon at large scales is in itself important because the large scales dominate the turbulence energy .    despite numerous studies of small - scale intermittency in the energy dissipation ,",
    "@xcite its large - scale fluctuation has not attracted much interest .",
    "experimentally , the fluctuation has been known to exist on some level , but it has not been discussed with any highlighting .",
    "the existing works are all theoretical .",
    "oboukhov @xcite considered that the fluctuation is significant .",
    "kraichnan @xcite considered that the fluctuation is smoothed out by spatial mixing , which could be caused by the action of pressure fluctuation .",
    "@xcite frisch @xcite considered that the fluctuation is significant in some specific configurations for turbulence production .",
    "thus , even for the significance of the fluctuation , no consensus has been reached on .",
    "we experimentally assess landau s remark , i.e. , whether the large - scale fluctuation of energy dissipation is significant , whether the large - scale fluctuation is universal , and whether the large - scale fluctuation affects small - scale statistics .",
    "the assessment requires more than one type of turbulence .",
    "we study grid and boundary - layer turbulence at several reynolds numbers . with a hot - wire anemometer and taylor s frozen - eddy hypothesis , we obtain a one - dimensional cut of the velocity field .",

    "the total length of the signal was @xmath54 points .",
    "in addition , to study the average and fluctuation of energy injection at @xmath50 m , the streamwise velocity was simultaneously measured at @xmath55 and 4.25 m .",
