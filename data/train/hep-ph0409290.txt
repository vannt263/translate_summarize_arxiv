    "with the recent experimental results for several expected states ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) in the charmonium spectrum , and the discovery of a state ( @xmath4 ) , which could be a @xmath5 charmonium level , it seems an appropriate time to revisit the potential model interpretation of the @xmath0 spectrum . for such models ,",
    "the challenges seem to be :    * are potential models capable of describing the spin splitting in a quantitatively satisfactory way ? * including the additional data , is it possible to determine the lorentz properties of the phenomenological confining potential ? *",
    "how well are the leptonic and radiative decays predicted ? * under what circumstances can the state at 3872 mev be interpreted as a charmonium level ?    here , we will attempt to answer these questions using a potential model which includes the @xmath1 and all one - loop corrections to the short distance potential supplemented with a linear phenomenological confining potential and its @xmath1 corrections .",
    "potential models range from non - relativistic forms such as the cornell model @xcite @xmath6 recently used to identify new charmonium states observable in @xmath7 decays @xcite , to those including all @xmath1 spin - dependent corrections , @xcite @xmath8 , which can be used to analyze the spectrum and decays of charmonium @xcite .",
    "one - loop qcd corrections can then be added to complete the non - relativistic treatment.@xcite    in our analysis , we utilize a semi - relativistic hamiltonian of the form @xmath9 explicit forms of the short distance potential @xmath10 , the long distance potential @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the one - loop qcd correction to @xmath13 , can be found in ref .. the @xmath0 mass spectrum and the corresponding wave functions were obtained using a variational approach .",
    "the wave functions were expanded as @xmath14 and the @xmath15 s were determined by minimizing @xmath16 .",
    "this procedure results in a linear eigenvalue equation for the @xmath15 s and the energies .",
    "the wave functions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal and the @xmath17 eigenvalue @xmath18 is an upper bound on the exact energy @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the lowest four eigenvalues are stable to a part in @xmath21 .",
    "the energies and wave functions were obtained by treating @xmath10+@xmath11 as a perturbation to @xmath22 and by treating @xmath23 nonperturbatively .",
    "we fit the spectrum to ten well established and @xmath24 . ]",
    "@xmath0 states by adjusting the parameters @xmath25 and the vector fraction @xmath26 to minimize @xmath27 .",
    "our nonperturbative fit gives : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "interestingly , the perturbative fit yields similar results for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , but prefers @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the results for the levels are given in table [ spectra ] and the predicted @xmath34 transitions widths are given in table [ e1 ] .",
    "the semi - relativistic model provides a quantitatively good description of the charmonium spectrum .",
    "of the states included in the fit , only the @xmath35 is poorly described .",
    "the @xmath34 widths agree reasonably well with experiment@xcite .",
    "however , based on the model considered here , the @xmath4 can not be explained solely in terms of a charmonium @xmath5 state described by a potential .",
    "spin effects alone can only separate the @xmath5 from the @xmath36 by 40 mev or so , which suggests that the inclusion of open channel effects is essential if this identification is to be established .",
