    "many chemical and biological systems exhibit excitability . in small ( zero - dimensional ) geometry",

    "this behaviour is crucial for the electrical activation of cardiac tissue or the propagation of nerve pulses where activation should only be possible after a sufficiently large stimulus .",
    "moreover , the decay to the rest state allows for the medium to be repeatedly activated - also crucial for the physiological functioning of the heart and the nervous system .",
    "one - dimensional excitable media support travelling pulses , or rather , periodic wave trains ranging in wavelength @xmath0 from the localized limit @xmath1 to a minimal value @xmath2 below which propagation fails .",
    "pulses and wave trains are best - known from nerve propagation along axons . in two dimensions one typically observes spiral waves .",
    "spirals have been observed for example in the auto - catalytic belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite , in the aggregation of the slime mold dictyostelium discoideum @xcite and in cardiac tissue @xcite .    for certain system parameters the propagation of isolated pulses and wave trains may fail ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the analytical tools employed to describe these phenomena range from kinematic theory @xcite , asymptotic perturbation theory @xcite to dynamical systems approaches @xcite .",
    "numerical observations reveal that independent of the detailed structure of a particular excitable media model , the bifurcation behaviour of excitable media is generic .",
    "for example , a saddle - node bifurcation is generic for single pulses and for wave trains .",
    "however , there exists no general theory which accounts for all bifurcations which may appear . in this paper",
    "we develop a normal form for excitable media which is build around the observation that the propagation failure of a one - dimensional wave train is mediated by the interaction of a pulse with the inhibitor of the preceding pulse .",
    "+ in section  [ sec-1d ] we briefly review some basic properties of excitable media and illustrate them with a specific example . in section  [ sec - nf ]",
    "we introduce the normal form .",
    "the properties and the bifurcation scenarios of this normal form are investigated in section  [ sec - bt ] . in section  [ sec - num1 ]",
    "we show how the parameters of the normal form can be determined from numerical simulations of the excitable medium and then compare the predictions of the normal form with actual numerical simulations of a partial differential equation .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion in section  [ sec - disc ] .",
    "most theoretical investigations of excitable media are based on coupled reaction - diffusion models .",
    "we follow this tradition and investigate a two - component excitable medium with an activator @xmath3 and a non - diffusive inhibitor @xmath4 described by @xmath5 this is a reparametrized version of a model introduced by barkley @xcite .",
    "note that the diffusion constant @xmath6 is not a relevant parameter as it can be scaled out by rescaling length .",
    "although the normal form which we will introduce in section  [ sec - nf ] is independent of the particular model used , we illustrate some basic properties of excitable media using the particular model ( [ barkley ] ) . later in section  [ sec - num1 ]",
    "we show correspondence of the predictions of our normal form with numerical simulations of the model ( [ barkley ] ) .",
    "our choice of model is motivated by the fact that this model incorporates the ingredients of an excitable system in a compact and lucid way .",
    "thus , for @xmath7 the rest state @xmath8 is linearly stable with decay rates @xmath9 along the activator direction and @xmath10 along the inhibitor direction .",
    "perturbing @xmath3 above the threshold @xmath11 ( in 0d ) will lead to growth of @xmath3 . in the absence of @xmath4",
    "the activator would saturate at @xmath12 leading to a bistable system . a positive inhibitor growth factor @xmath13 and @xmath14 forces the activator to decay back to @xmath15 .",
    "finally also the inhibitor with the refractory time constant @xmath16 will decay back to @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath18 the system is in zero - dimensional systems no longer excitable but instead bistable .    in order to study pulse propagation in one - dimensional excitable media",
    "it is useful to first consider the case of constant @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting bistable model is exactly solvable @xcite and the pulse velocity is @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "hence , excitability requires that @xmath11 is below the stall value @xmath20 .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 characterizes the strength of excitability and @xmath22 coincides with the solitary pulse velocity for @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath24 and not too large @xmath25 , pulse propagation fails for @xmath13 larger than some @xmath26 .",
    "the critical growth factor @xmath26 marks the onset of a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the saddle - node can be intuitively understood when we consider the activator pulse as a heat source , not unlike a fire - front in a bushfire . due to the inhibitor",
    "the width of the pulse decreases with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the heat contained within the pulse decreases . at a critical width , or critical @xmath13 ,",
    "the heat contained within the pulse is too small to ignite / excite the medium in front of the pulse .",
    "[ fig - pulses ]    ( a )    ( b )    even if a given set of equation parameters allows for propagation of a single isolated pulse , the system may not necessarily support a pulse in a periodic box of finite length or a wave train consisting of several of such pulses : if the distance @xmath0 between two consecutive pulses of the train becomes too small , the pulses run into the refractory tail of the preceding pulse ( see figure  [ fig - pulses ] ) , and may consecutively decay .",
    "hence , propagation failure for periodic wave trains is controlled by the decay of the inhibitor , and propagation is only possible when the inter - pulse distance @xmath0 is larger than a critical wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath2 diverges for @xmath27 when the decay rate of the inhibitor @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "the critical wavelength @xmath2 is a lower bound for the wavelength for the existence of periodic wave trains .",
    "one can also think of keeping @xmath0 fixed and , as before , vary @xmath13 .",
    "then the saddle - node @xmath29 is a monotonically increasing function .    in the next section we present a normal form which incorporates the saddle - node bifurcation , and",
    "moreover predicts other types of bifurcations .",
    "it is well known that an isolated pulse undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation above a certain threshold value of the refractoriness @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding generic normal form for such a saddle - node bifurcation is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is , for example , the amplitude or velocity of a pulse with the corresponding values at the saddle - node bifurcation subtracted .",
    "the bifurcation parameter @xmath32 measures the distance from the bifurcation point and is proportional to @xmath33",
    ". the normal form ( [ sn0 ] ) accurately describes the behaviour of isolated solitary pulses in one - dimensional excitable media close to criticality .",
    "we use this normal form for a saddle - node bifurcation for an isolated pulse ( [ sn0 ] ) as a seed to construct a normal form for general travelling in excitable media incorporating finite wavelength effects",
    ".    in particular we look at a single pulse on a ring with finite length , i.e. in a one - dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions , and at wave trains with a finite wavelength .",
    "both cases are depicted in figure  [ fig - pulses ] . in that case",
    "the saddle - node ( [ sn0 ] ) will be disturbed and will depend on the length of the periodic box in the case of a single pulse ( figure  [ fig - pulses]a ) or on the wavelength of the wave train ( figure  [ fig - pulses]b ) .",
    "the interaction of the pulse ( or a member of a wave train ) with the preceding pulse ( or more accurate with its inhibitor ; see figure  [ fig - pulses ] ) modifies as discussed above the bifurcation behaviour .",
    "we may therefore extend the saddle - node normal form to @xmath34 where @xmath35 describes the inhibitor of the preceding pulse who is temporally displaced by @xmath36 where @xmath0 is the wavelength of the pulse train , i.e. the distance between two consecutive pulses , and @xmath37 is its uniform velocity .",
    "we neglect here a possible temporal dependency of @xmath38 .",
    "note that in the case of a single pulse in a ring , @xmath35 describes the inhibitor of the single pulse which had been created by the pulse at the time of the last revolution around the ring and @xmath0 is simply the length of the periodic box .",
    "+ we assume an exponential decay ( in space and time ) of the inhibitor of well separated pulses .",
    "this is the case for the system ( [ barkley ] ) .",
    "we may write @xmath39 where the function @xmath40 and the decay - rate @xmath41 depend on the particular model chosen ; for example for the model ( [ barkley ] ) we have @xmath42 . in the limiting case of isolated pulses",
    "we note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and hence we retrieve the unperturbed saddle - node bifurcation ( [ sn0 ] ) .",
    "the ansatz for @xmath35 is a simplification where we ignore the cumulative effect of the inhibitor .",
    "( note that the equation for the inhibitor @xmath4 in ( [ barkley ] ) can be solved directly and involves an integral over @xmath3 , i.e. involves history. ) the unknown function @xmath45 can be taylor - expanded around the saddle - node @xmath46 .",
    "we summarize and arrive at the following normal form @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath42 for the model equation ( [ barkley ] ) .",
    "pulses have a nonzero width @xmath49 which implies that the temporal delay @xmath36 has to be modified to @xmath50 .",
    "this equation already produces qualitatively all the results we will present in the subsequent sections .",
    "however , much better quantitative agreement is achieved by taking into account that a variation in the amplitude implies a change in velocities and henceforth a change of the effective inhibition .",
    "if we allow for a single pulse to have a temporarily varying pulse amplitude or , in the case of a wave train consisting of distinct members , if we allow for different amplitudes of individual members of the wave train , we have to take into account that the propagation behaviour is amplitude dependent : larger pulses have larger velocities .",
    "hence , a pulse @xmath51 which is larger than its predecessor @xmath52 runs further into the inhibitor - populated space created by its predecessor .",
    "if @xmath53 the finite wavelength induced shift of the bifurcation is stronger compared to the case of equal amplitudes .",
    "conversely , if @xmath54 the finite wavelength induced shift of the bifurcation is weaker compared to the case of equal amplitudes .",
    "this effect is stronger the larger the difference of the two amplitudes @xmath55 .",
    "the inclusion of the amplitude differences affects the bifurcation behaviour depending continuously on the difference @xmath55 .",
    "we thus add a term @xmath56 with @xmath57 into the wavelength dependant inhibitor term in ( [ nf ] ) , and arrive at @xmath58 or after relabeling of @xmath59 @xmath60 it is this equation which we propose as a normal form to study bifurcations of one - dimensional wave trains .",
    "before we show how to determine the parameters of the normal form , we will describe its properties with a main emphasis on bifurcations .",
    "besides the well - known saddle - node bifurcation we identify a symmetry preserving hopf bifurcation and a symmetry breaking spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "numerical integration of partial differential equation models of excitable media such as ( [ barkley ] ) confirm these bifurcation scenarios of the normal form ( [ nf ] ) .",
    "although some of these bifurcations have been previously observed in numerical simulations , up to now there did not exist a unified framework to study these bifurcations .",
    "the normal form is able to identify these bifurcations as being generic for excitable media , rather than as being particular to certain models of excitable media .",
    "this is the main achievement of our present work .",
    "numerical simulations of excitable media show that the bifurcations of a _ single _ propagating pulse in a ring ( as in figure  [ fig - pulses]a ) are different from the bifurcations of a wave train consisting of several distinct pulses ( as in figure  [ fig - pulses]b ) .",

    "the two solutions coalesce in a saddle - node bifurcation with @xmath62 since @xmath63 is small we have @xmath64 .",
    "this indicates that the saddle - node of a periodic wave train occurs at smaller values of the bifurcation parameter @xmath32 than for the isolated pulse , and the bifurcation is shifted to the left with respect to the isolated pulse ( see figure  [ fig - hopfsketch ] ) .",

    "we have constructed a normal form for travelling waves in one - dimensional excitable media which takes the form of a delay differential equation .",
    "the construction is based on the well - known observation that the interaction of a pulse with the inhibitor of the preceding pulse modifies the generic saddle - node bifurcation of an isolated pulse .",
    "the normal form ( [ nf ] ) exhibits a rich bifurcation behaviour which we could verify by numerically simulating the partial differential equation ( [ barkley ] ) .",
    "besides the well known saddle - node bifurcations for isolated pulses and for periodic wave trains the normal form also exhibits a symmetry preserving hopf bifurcation and a symmetry breaking , spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation .",

    "the symmetry preserving hopf bifurcation is found to occur before the saddle - node bifurcation for a single pulse in a ring . for a wave train consisting of several pulses in a ring , the hopf- and the saddle - node bifurcations occur after the symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation in which every second pulse dies .",

    "alternans describe the scenario whereby action potential durations are alternating periodically between short and long periods .",
    "the interest in alternans has risen as they are believed to trigger spiral wave breakup in cardiac tissue and ventricular fibrillation @xcite . besides numerical investigations of the barkley model @xcite , the modified barkley model @xcite , the beeler - reuter model @xcite , the noble - model @xcite and the karma - model @xcite , where a hopf bifurcation has been reported ,",
    "there have been many theoretical attempts to quantify this bifurcation for a single - pulse on a ring . since",
    "the pioneering work @xcite alternans have been related to a period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "it was proposed that the bifurcation can be described by a one - dimensional return map relating the action potential duration ( @xmath177 ) to the previous recovery time , or diastolic interval ( @xmath178 ) , which is the time between the end of a pulse to the next excitation .",
    "a period - doubling bifurcation was found if the slope of the so called restitution curve which relates the @xmath177 to the @xmath178 , exceeds one . a critical account on the predictive nature of the restitution curve for period - doubling bifurcations",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the instability was analyzed by reducing the partial differential equation describing the excitable media to a discrete map via a reduction to a free - boundary problem . in @xcite",
    "the hopf bifurcation could be described by means of a reduced set of ordinary - differential equations using a collective coordinate approach . in @xcite",
    "the bifurcation was linked to an instability of a single integro - delay equation .",
    "the condition for instability given by this approach states - as in some previous studies involving one - dimensional return maps - that the slope of the restitution curve needs to be greater than one .",
    "however , as evidenced in experiments @xcite and in theoretical studies @xcite alternans do not necessarily occur when the slope of the restitution curve is greater than one .",
    "in further studies it would be interesting to see how our criterion @xmath179 is related to that condition . note that @xmath49 is related to the @xmath177 and @xmath180 to the recovery time @xmath178 .",
    "+ in the context of alternans the hopf bifurcation has been described as a supercritical bifurcation @xcite ( although their occurrence is related to wave break up @xcite ) .",
    "further study will explore whether the subcritical character of the hopf bifurcation we find is model - dependant or indeed generic .",
    "+ to go beyond the case of a single pulse circulating in a ring , periodically stimulated excitable media have been studied in the context of alternans @xcite . in @xcite one - dimensional maps",
    "were developed to study the hopf bifurcation and the transition to conduction blocks . in @xcite",
    "a nonlocal partial differential equation has been proposed to study spatiotemporal dynamics of alternans .",
    "it would be interesting for further studies to see how the transition to conduction blocks explored in these paced cardiac excitable media @xcite can be described by the spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation we found in our normal form .",
    "the pitchfork bifurcation however does not require a fixed pacing site and does not require external pacing but rather is dynamically induced .",
    "this may aid in investigating the formation of conduction blocks purely as a dynamical phenomenon of wave trains .",
    "+ an interesting scenario in our normal is the coalescence of the spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation with the hopf bifurcation when @xmath181 .",
    "this condition implies @xmath182 .",
    "then the hopf frequency is in resonance with the spatial instability in which every second pulse dies .",
    "connections to alternans of this scenario are planned for further research .",
    "+ ideally , one would like to deduce the normal form directly from a model for excitable media and determine its parameters without relying on numerical simulations of a particular excitable medium .",
    "one initial path along that avenue could be to use the non - perturbative approach developed in @xcite to determine the parameters .",
    "this method was developed to study critical wave propagation of single pulses and pulse trains in excitable media in one and two dimensions .",
    "it was based on the observation that close to the bifurcation point the pulse shape is approximately a bell - shaped function .",
    "numerical simulations show that this is the case for the barkley model ( [ barkley ] ) close to the saddle - node bifurcation . a test function approximation that optimises the two free parameters of a bell - shaped function , i.e. its amplitude and its width , allows us to find the actual bifurcation point , @xmath26 , and determine the pulse shape for close - to - critical pulses at excitabilities near @xmath26 .",
    "this method has so far also been successfully applied to other non - excitable reaction - diffusion equations @xcite . to apply the method for our purpose",
