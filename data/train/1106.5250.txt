    "the differential rotation of the sun s convective envelope terminates abruptly at the interface with the underlying radiative zone .",
    "the transition to uniform rotation takes place across a stably - stratified shear layer known as the solar tachocline @xcite , whose thickness is at most a few percent of the sun s radius @xcite .",
    "more than two decades after being first observed @xcite a complete theory of the dynamics of the tachocline is still lacking . in particular , the thinness of the tachocline seems to be at odds with the known angular momentum transport properties of stratified rotating fluids , including advection by meridional circulations @xcite .",
    "such circulations have a tendency to burrow into the radiative zone , transporting the convection zone s angular momentum and thereby thickening the tachocline . in order for the tachocline to remain thin",
    ", some additional mechanism must be present that transports angular momentum latitudinally , and in such a way as to enforce uniform rotation .",
    "in addition , the angular velocity of the radiative zone inferred from helioseismology lies within the range of angular velocities observed at the solar surface , indicating that the spin - down of the surface by magnetic solar - wind drag @xcite has been communicated throughout the solar interior .",
    "this requires significant _ vertical _ transport of angular momentum . again",
    ", the transport must be such as to enforce uniform rotation .",
    "we call such transport `` frictional '' , meaning down - gradient in angular velocity .",
    "several authors have argued that a combination of anisotropic turbulence and internal wave breaking can provide the required latitudinal and vertical angular momentum transport ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , both of these processes are known to have _",
    "anti_-frictional properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on this basis",
    ", @xcite argued that no non - magnetic model can explain the observed thinness of the tachocline and the persistence of uniform rotation within the radiative zone . on the other hand , the presence of a global - scale primordial magnetic field provides a natural explanation for the interior s uniform rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a field enforces uniform rotation through the elasticity of the field lines imparted by magnetic tension .",
    "the thinness of the tachocline can also be explained by the presence of such a field , provided that the field lines are very nearly horizontal within the tachocline , so that angular momentum is transported from low to high latitudes by maxwell stresses @xcite .",
    "we call such a field `` confined '' , meaning that the time - averaged mean field resides below the base of the convection zone . an unconfined field , on the other hand , would cause the convection zone s differential rotation to propagate into the radiative zone @xcite",
    ".    to explain the confinement of the magnetic field , some process must be invoked to counteract the outward diffusion of the field throughout the sun s lifetime .",
    "global - scale meridional flows that downwell from the convection zone into the radiative zone offer a possible mechanism for achieving magnetic field confinement  these are the same meridional flows that would lead to tachocline thickening in the absence of an interior magnetic field .",
    "this confinement mechanism was first suggested by @xcite and later studied numerically by @xcite .",
    "the flows are generated by gyroscopic pumping in the convection zone , a mechanism which has been widely studied in the context of the earth s atmosphere , and more recently in an astrophysical context @xcite . in brief , the same angular momentum transport by reynolds stresses that gives rise to the differential rotation of the convection zone also drives a meridional circulation through angular momentum conservation ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "such meridional circulations are a robust consequence of anisotropic angular momentum transport , as originally discussed by @xcite .",
    "although the sun s meridional flows can be observed directly at the solar surface , and inferred in the near - surface layers from local helioseismology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their amplitude and structure deeper within the solar interior is currently unknown .",
    "theoretical and numerical models of the large - scale dynamics of the solar interior are required in order to establish whether the gyroscopically pumped circulation is strong enough , and penetrates deeply enough into the radiative zone , to confine the interior magnetic field and thereby explain the observed tachocline structure .",
    "several such numerical studies have been performed @xcite , but none has successfully reproduced the field - confinement scenario of @xcite . however , since computing limitations prevent any numerical model from reaching true solar parameter values , this failure may simply reflect the fact that the numerical models are not in the parameter regime of relevance to the solar tachocline .    an alternative , analytical approach was proposed by @xcite , and further developed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "these preliminary models examined the amplitude and depth of penetration of global - scale meridional flows into the radiative zone in the absence of an interior magnetic field . in these non - magnetic models , the burrowing of the meridional flows was halted only by the presence of viscosity . in the steady state , the meridional mass flux was found to decay exponentially with depth below the radiative  convective interface on a lengthscale @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the solar radius and @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the viscosity , @xmath4 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath5 is the buoyancy frequency , and @xmath6 is the mean solar rotation rate .",
    "this result shows how the burrowing tendency of the meridional flows is strengthened by rotation , and weakened by stable stratification and viscosity . within the solar tachocline @xmath7 , and so viscosity alone",
    "can not prevent the meridional flows from burrowing into the radiative zone .",
    "@xcite found that the amplitude of the steady - state meridional flows in their model was sensitive not only to the value of @xmath8 , but also to conditions at the interface between the convective and radiative zones ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in a subsequent study , @xcite showed that the vertical mass flux below the radiative  convective interface can be quantified in terms of two constraints .",
    "the first constraint is that there must be stresses present in the radiative zone that overcome taylor  proudman balance . in the absence of such stresses ,",
    "any meridional flows would have to be parallel to the rotation axis , which is not compatible with mass conservation .",
    "when such stresses are present , however , downwelling meridional flows are able to turn around and return to the convection zone  this is another example of gyroscopic pumping .",
    "@xcite called this the `` mechanical '' constraint .    the second constraint is due to the presence of stable stratification , which inhibits vertical flows ; we call this the `` thermal '' constraint .",

    "* ) , and @xmath13 is a dimensionless `` geometrical '' factor that depends on the details of the star s internal structure .",
    "the two constraints set two upper bounds for the meridional flow velocity , which then scales as the smaller of the two . in the case where the mechanical constraint is smaller , the meridional flow velocity depends on the nature of the stresses that overcome taylor  proudman balance . considered both laminar viscous stresses and turbulent reynolds stresses in the convective cores of `` lithium - dip '' stars . in the present paper we consider magnetic stresses , which we argue are the dominant mechanism for angular momentum transport in the solar radiative zone . for simplicity",

    "we demonstrate a simple relationship between the structure and magnitude of the confined magnetic field and the pattern and amplitude of the meridional flows .",
    "in particular , we quantify the mechanical constraint from the confined magnetic field . in  [ sec : strat ] we extend these results to the stratified case , recovering the thermal constraint mentioned above .",
    "we then discuss in  [ sec : disc ] what insight the results of our simplified model provide into the nonlinear dynamics of the solar interior .",

    "we use a similar model to that of .",
    "although our model is intended as a simplified cartesian analogue of the tachocline picture proposed by @xcite , it also goes beyond theirs in certain respects .",
    "we explicitly model the thermal and dynamical coupling between the convective and radiative zones , and are thus able to draw more quantitative conclusions concerning the role of this interaction in the global - scale solution .",

    "although this background state can not hold over all latitudes and depths within the solar interior ( for reasons of mass conservation and solenoidality of @xmath38 ) , we hope that it offers a reasonable qualitative approximation to conditions within the tachocline at middle and high latitudes .",

    "the gas pressure far exceeds the magnetic pressure , and so the required perturbation is very small .",

    "we note also that our cartesian model can not adequately describe the polar regions , where the effects of geometrical curvature become significant .",

    "the only meridional flows are those maintained by viscosity , and their magnitude scales with the ekman number , @xmath87 .",
    "the meridional flows therefore become vanishingly weak in the limit @xmath88 .",

    "the structure of the boundary layer depends on the particular choice of boundary conditions at @xmath90 , including the magnetic boundary conditions .",
    "however , we have verified that the meridional flow outside the boundary layer is hardly affected by the choice of magnetic boundary conditions .",
    "for @xmath91 the radiative zone divides into two dynamically distinct regions , separated by a thin internal boundary layer at @xmath92 , say ( see figure [ e+lambdavary]c ) .",
    "the region above the boundary layer is close to taylor  proudman balance , with all components of @xmath93 independent of @xmath66 , indicating that lorentz forces are locally negligible ( see figure [ fig : utwithsigma]a in  [ sec : numexp_strat ] for plots of @xmath94 ) . in the region below the boundary layer , on the other hand , the lorentz force is dominant , and all components of @xmath93 decay exponentially with depth . from here on",
    "we refer to these two regions as being `` weakly magnetic '' and `` magnetically dominated '' respectively .",
    "the boundary layer separating these two regions we call the `` magnetic transition layer '' .",

    "the forcing is switched off , and taylor  proudman balance is achieved . as a result ,",
    "the meridional streamlines and angular velocity contours become aligned with the rotation axis , and a portion of the convection zone s differential rotation extends into the radiative zone .",
    "this differential rotation winds up the magnetic field lines , producing a lorentz torque whose amplitude increases exponentially with depth . within the magnetic transition layer ( here around @xmath95 )",
    "the lorentz torque is strong enough to overcome taylor  proudman balance , and gyroscopically pumps a meridional flow .",

    "the latitudinal differential rotation below the base of the convection zone extends downward until it meets the transition layer , where it winds up the magnetic field lines , producing a lorentz torque that overcomes taylor  proudman balance and gyroscopically pumps a meridional flow . in the steady state",
    ", the downwelling mass flux within the weakly magnetic region must be exactly that demanded by the transition layer , which is expressed by ( [ eq : magnetic - pumping ] ) .",
    "an analogy can be made with the more familiar ekman pumping that occurs in ekman layers .",

    "the entire region below the tachopause is held in uniform rotation by the confined magnetic field . however , an obvious shortcoming of our unstratified solutions is that the `` tachocline '' has no vertical shear , quite unlike the solar tachocline . in the @xcite model ,",
    "the tachocline s vertical shear is explained by the presence of stable stratification , via the thermal - wind relation . in the following sections we reintroduce stratification into our model , in order to better approximate conditions within the solar tachocline .",
    "the importance of stratification in our model can be measured in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath148 , which appears on the left - hand side of ( [ ener ] ) .",

    "the same is true for the profiles of @xmath94 in these solutions , which are shown in figure  [ fig : utwithsigma]a . in particular ,",
    "the weakly magnetic region ( @xmath154 ) remains in taylor  proudman balance .",
    "we refer to all such cases as `` unstratified '' , since any effects due to stratification are negligible .    as @xmath8",

    "moreover , the physical processes that give rise to ( [ eq : w0estim3 ] ) will be present in any self - consistent model of the solar interior , and so ( [ eq : w0estim3 ] ) ought to be a robust result under solar - like conditions .",

    ", none of these numerical models has so far obtained solutions that are satisfactorily close to solar observations , and none has achieved magnetic confinement over an extended range of latitudes .",
    "these failures have led some to conclude that the magnetic confinement picture of @xcite is unworkable . however , the analytical results presented here suggest that magnetic confinement by meridional flows _ can _ be achieved in the parameter regime appropriate to the solar tachocline .",
    "we can also use our results ( a ) to explain the lack of magnetic confinement in existing numerical models , and ( b ) to guide parameter selection for future models .    as shown in  [ sec : numexp_strat ] , the amplitude of meridional flows within the radiative interior decreases monotonically as the stratification is increased . moreover , in a time - dependent model , the timescale for the burrowing of the flows , given by ( [ eq : es ] ) , increases with stratification . in the strongly stratified regime , with @xmath235 ,",
    "the burrowing of meridional flows is even slower than viscous diffusion .",
    "but if @xmath7 , as is the case in the tachocline , then the meridional flows are approximately inviscid . when modelling the solar interior , it is common practice to impose a rotation rate and stratification profile that are close to solar , in order to ensure a realistic separation between the dynamical timescales . the viscous , thermal , and magnetic diffusivities ( @xmath236 )",

    "however , adopting this strategy does not guarantee that @xmath7 . indeed ,",
    "if the ratio of buoyancy and rotational frequencies @xmath190 is chosen to match the true tachocline value , then the condition @xmath7 requires the prandtl number @xmath237 to be very small , @xmath238 this condition is satisfied in the solar interior , but is beyond the reach of current numerical simulations , which instead typically have a prandtl number much closer to unity , in order to reduce the numerical stiffness of the equations .",
    "this places such simulations in the strongly stratified regime in which ( a ) meridional flow velocity decays exponentially with depth below the convection zone , and ( b ) viscous stresses make a significant dynamical contribution , even if the ekman number is small , i.e.  even if @xmath239 .",
    "the numerical difficulty is , in fact , rather easily avoided by imposing a weaker stratification , and thus allowing for a larger prandtl number .",

    "we then expect the meridional flow velocity in the tachocline to scale as ( [ eq : w0estim3 ] ) , provided that the radiative  convective interface remains approximately isothermal ( see discussion below ( [ eq : g1_g2 ] ) ) .",
    "a further numerical difficultly is the need to resolve both the thin tachocline and the thinner tachopause .",
    "this difficultly can be alleviated by allowing the tachocline to be somewhat thicker than is observed in the sun .",

    "for this purpose we created a model of the tachocline that is sufficiently simple to have analytical solutions yet , we believe , incorporates enough of the relevant dynamics to yield quantitative predictions .    we have identified four distinct parameter regimes that occur in our results as the strength of the stratification is increased . for solar parameter values ,",
    "the results lie in either the `` weakly stratified '' regime or the `` moderately stratified '' regime ( see  [ sec : weak_and_mod ] ) . in both of these regimes",
    "the strength of the meridional flow within the tachocline is determined by a combination of thermal equilibrium and thermal - wind balance , and follows the scaling predicted by @xcite . with realistic tachocline parameters ,",
    "the downwelling flow is of sufficient strength to confine an interior magnetic field across a thin boundary layer , and the thickness of the tachocline is related to the strength of the magnetic field by ( [ eq : bt_estimate ] ) .",
    "by contrast , all previous attempts to model the tachocline numerically have been performed in the `` strongly '' stratified regime , in which the burrowing of meridional flows is significantly reduced by viscosity .",
    "we believe that this explains the lack of field confinement in those models .",
    "to remedy the problem , we suggest an alternative set of numerically achievable parameters , which we predict will yield results that are much more consistent with solar observations .    this project was initiated during the isima 2010 summer program , funded by the nsf career grant 0847477 , the france ",
