    "located in the cygnus x complex at a distance of 1.36 @xmath2 0.12 kpc @xcite , the outflow in dr21 is probably one of the most enigmatic high - velocity molecular outflows associated with star forming regions .",
    "this outflow is extremely massive ( @xmath3 3000 m@xmath4 ) and energetic ( @xmath3 10@xmath5 erg ) with a luminosity in the 2 @xmath6 m band alone calculated to be 1800 l@xmath4 @xcite . the dr21 outflow has been suggested to be energized by a massive protostar with bolometric luminosity of about 10@xmath7 l@xmath4 @xcite , which would exceed the total bolometric luminosity of dr21 region ( 10@xmath8 l@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , such a massive star has so far never been clearly found out @xcite .",
    "the outflow appears to be bipolar with its strongest molecular lobes extending northeast - southwest , and emanating from a dense dusty filament that extends from north to south @xcite .",
    "however , there are some faint h@xmath9 filaments that show different orientations with some of them pointing back to the dr21 main .",
    "it has been suggested that the axis of this bipolar outflow might be located very close to the plane of the sky ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , the high velocity wings observed in h@xmath9 and co ( @xmath1080.82 to @xmath1146.84 km s@xmath12 ) and the overlapping of blue / redshifted emission on both lobes @xcite indicate a different scenario for its orientation . commonly bipolar outflows with their axes located close to the plane of the sky",
    "show slow radial velocities with their blue / redshifted lobes well separated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , overlapping blue / redshifted emission on both lobes might result from an outflow in the plane of the sky ( that seems to be unlikely due to its high velocity wings ) if the outflow is thought of as a cone with one side of the cone coming toward us and the other side moving away .",
    "@xcite additionally reported the presence of some collimated flows emanating from dr21 with different orientations to the main ne - sw dr21 outflow .    in high - density protostar clusters , envelopes and disks",
    "provide a viscous medium that can dissipate the kinetic energy of passing stars , greatly enhancing the probability of capture .",
    "this process opens the possibility of having protostellar mergers that may generate impulsive wide - angle outflows , shock - induced masers , radio continuum emission , and runaway massive protostars .",
    "both the ejection of massive stars and the launch of the impulsive outflow may be the result of the dynamic interaction and rearrangement of a system of massive stars .",
    "this process has been extensively discussed in @xcite .    very recent sensitive @xmath13co(2 - 1 ) millimeter and infrared observations have suggested that the massive ( 10 m@xmath4 ) and energetic ( @xmath0 10@xmath14 erg ) outflow located in the orion bn / kl region appears to have been produced by such a violent explosion during the disruption of the massive young stellar system of which the infrared and radio sources _ bn _ , _ n _ , and _",
    "i _ were all members about 500 years ago @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the complex of co and h@xmath9 emission in bn / kl is due to a phenomenon different from the well known collimated outflows produced by the young stars commonly associated with star formation . with this recent result in mind",
    ", one could consider if the flow emerging from dr21 could be a similar case as that occurred in bn / kl 500 years ago .",
    "we thus here report new sma interferometric observations of this outflow trying to elucidate its nature .",
    "the observations were made with the submillimeter array ( sma ) during 2011 august and 2012 july / august .",
    "the sma was in its subcompact , compact , and extended configurations with baselines ranging in projected length from 7 to 160 m. we used the mosaicing mode with half - power point spacing between field centers and covered the entire dr21 outflow mapped in h@xmath9 by @xcite , see figure 1 .",
    "we concatenated the three data sets using the task in miriad called \" _ uvcat _  .",
    "the three different observations were identical , and only the antenna configuration of the sma changed .    the sma correlator was configured in 24 spectral `` chunks '' ( or windows ) of 104 mhz each , with 128 channels distributed over each spectral window , providing a spectral resolution of 0.8125 mhz ( 1.05 km s@xmath12 ) per channel . the receivers were tuned to a frequency of 230.5387 ghz in the upper sideband ( usb ) , while the lower sideband ( lsb ) was centered on 220.5387 ghz .",
    "the @xmath13co(2 - 1 ) transition was detected in the usb at frequencies close to a frequency of 230.5 ghz .",
    "the full bandwidth of the sma correlator is 8 ghz ( 4 ghz in each band ) .",
    "the zenith opacity ( @xmath15 ) was @xmath0 0.1  0.3 , indicating reasonable weather conditions .",
    "observations of uranus provided the absolute scale for the flux density calibration .",
    "phase and amplitude calibrators were the star mwc349a , and the quasar j2007@xmath11404 .",
    "further technical descriptions of the sma and its calibration schemes can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data were calibrated using the idl superset mir , originally developed for the owens valley radio observatory @xcite and adapted for the sma.cqi/mircook.html ] the calibrated data were imaged and analyzed in a standard manner using the miriad , and karma @xcite packages .",
    "the line image rms noise was around 100 mjy beam@xmath12 for each velocity channel at an angular resolution of @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 with a p.a .",
    "= @xmath1174.0@xmath19 .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the @xmath13co(2 - 1 ) molecular emission detected in our sma mosaic towards the dr21 region . we construct this large scale integrated intensity map only using the emission arising from the high velocity gas and thus avoiding the emission in the range from @xmath1015 to 15 km s@xmath12 . in this velocity range the line emission is spatially extended , and could not be well sampled by the sma . in our channel velocity maps , we found that the redshifted @xmath13co(2 - 1 ) emission shows radial velocities from @xmath113 up to @xmath1150 km s@xmath12 , while the blueshifted one from @xmath113 down to @xmath1080 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this velocity range is in very good agreement to that previously observed by @xcite .",
    "however , our high angular resolution observations revealed clear molecular filaments with different orientations , and some of them well correlated with h@xmath9 emission ( figure 1 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the co filaments reported here are composed of about three hundred compact features observed in our channel velocity cube with velocity windows of 1 km s@xmath12 and their positions on the sky are shown in our figure 1 .",
    "the observational parameters of these compact features were found using the task _ imfit _ of miriad .",
    "each of these filaments show clear velocity gradients that follow a hubble law ( figure 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , most of these filaments appear to point out a common velocity center located at about @xmath103.0 km s@xmath12 , in very good agreement with the ambient molecular velocity of dr21 ( @xmath103.0 km s@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of these physical features are also found in the molecular outflow located in bn / kl and are related to an explosive event occurred 500 years ago as described in the introduction .",
    "however , the outflow in dr21 has a clear east - west bipolar shape observed on the h@xmath9 maps .",
    "this h@xmath9 bipolar shape could be due to the highly extinction produced by the north - south dusty lane where many of the co filaments are revealed for the first time .",
    "this also seems to be the case in the outflow located in bn / kl , see @xcite .    using a similar approach to that applied in @xcite , we determine the position of the origin of the co filaments in @xmath20(j2000)=20@xmath21 39@xmath22 1.1@xmath23 @xmath2 0.3@xmath23 and @xmath24(2000)=@xmath1142@xmath19 19@xmath25 37.9@xmath1 @xmath2 5@xmath1 .",
    "this position coincides well with the center of an expanding cometary hii region ( see figure 3 ) imaged by @xcite .",
    "this positional coincidence suggests that both the explosive outflow and the large cometary hii region were probably produced by the same mechanism .",
    "moreover , at the position of the outflow origin there is not a single young ( radio , submillimeter , or infrared ) star , suggesting that maybe its \" source  is no longer located there , as in the case of the explosive outflow in orion bn / kl @xcite .",
    "there is also a depression of centimeter continuum emission at this position ( see figure 3 ) .    the explosive becklin - neugebauer ( bn)/kleinman - low ( kl ) outflow emerging from omc1 behind the orion nebula was powered by the dynamical decay of a non - hierarchical multiple system @xmath0 500 years ago that ejected the massive stars i , bn , and source n , with velocities of about 10  30 km s@xmath12 @xcite . in this dynamical decay of a non - hierarchical multiple system",
    "a kinetic energy of about 10@xmath14 ergs was liberated .",
    "if we assume that the outflow in dr21 was produced by a dynamical decay of a non - hierarchical multiple system , the kinetic energy liberated on that disruption was about 20 times larger than that in the orion bn / kl system ( @xmath3 2 @xmath17 10@xmath5 erg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    again ,",
    "very crudely assuming that the velocities of the stars ejected in dr21 have similar velocities as the ones located in orion bn / kl ( this without any evidence ) , and a dynamical age of about 10,000 years ( obtained from our molecular data , t@xmath26 @xmath0 1.2 @xmath17 10@xmath27 cm / 4 @xmath17 10@xmath28 cm s@xmath12 @xmath0 10 , 000 yrs ) for the outflow in dr21 .",
    "the reader should note that this estimation is also an approximation , since the values for the velocity are only radial velocities , and the displacements are only the projected components .",
    "we thus found that the ejected stars should be located about 25@xmath1 far from the center of the dr21 outflow .",
    "this is exactly the distance of the bright infrared source `` dr21-d '' associated with a small cometary hii region ( figure 3 ) with respect to the origin of the outflow in dr21 .",
    "this suggests that maybe dr21-d is related with the explosive event in dr21 .",
    "the figure 3 also reveals a reflecting east - west cavity associated with the large cometary hii region .",
    "these infrared nebulosities are also observed in orion bn / kl and most of them are not heated by stars .",
    "they are possibly heated by strong shocks produced by the explosive outflow @xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ]    all the characteristics found in these observations in the outflow located in dr21 are very similar to the ones reported in the explosive outflow located in orion bn / kl @xcite .",
    "we thus propose that the complex of co and h@xmath9 emission located in dr21 might have been produced by an explosive phenomenon different from the standard disk - outflows associated with star formation .",
    "this outflow was probably originated during the disintegration of a massive stellar system as the one occurred in orion bn - kl some 500 years ago .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction section , the process of that disintegration of the stellar system has been discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the presence of explosive phenomena in two of the best studied regions of massive star formation suggests that the phenomenon may be more common than previously thought and that future detailed studies may reveal more of them in other regions .",
    "sensitive high angular resolution ( @xmath0 2@xmath1 ) co(2 - 1 ) line observations made with the submillimeter array of the flow emanating from the massive star forming region dr21 located in the cygnus x molecular cloud have been presented .",
    "we found about 25 molecular blueshifted and redshifted filaments .",
    "these molecular filaments follow nearly straight lines and appear to all point toward a common center .",
    "the radial velocity along each filament follows clearly a hubble law , indicative of an explosive event .",
    "our observations suggest that this outflow appears to have been produced by a violent explosion that took place about 10,000 years ago , and that seems to be related with the disintegration of a massive non - hierarchical stellar system , as the one that occurred in orion bn / kl , but about 20 times more energetic . however , many more theoretical and observational studies are still needed to confirm our hypothesis .",
