    "the curvaton @xcite is an interesting new proposal for explaining the observed large - scale adiabatic density perturbations in the context of inflation .",
    "perturbations are acquired by a field other than the inflaton during inflation , whose energy density is subdominant during inflation but which comes to dominate sometime afterwards , at which point its initial isocurvature perturbations convert to adiabatic @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "decay of the curvaton to conventional matter locks the perturbations in as adiabatic , though there can be complex phenomenology if some species have already decoupled from the thermal bath by the time this happens @xcite .",
    "an aspect of this process which has been implicit in most papers is that this process also offers a new mechanism of reheating . the first detailed discussion of this aspect appeared recently in ref .",
    "@xcite by feng and li , who named it _",
    "curvaton reheating_. the curvaton is a type of matter whose energy density is not diluted during inflation , and some or all of the present material in the universe may have survived inflation via the curvaton .",
    "this reheating mechanism complements the other two known mechanisms , the standard one being decay of the inflaton energy density into conventional matter and the rarely - used alternative being gravitational particle production at the end of inflation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will explore an application of curvaton reheating to a particular model of braneworld inflation known as _ steep inflation _",
    "this models brings the inflationary epoch to an end in a novel way .",
    "the potential chosen ( for example a steep exponential ) is so steep that it would not drive inflation in the standard cosmology , but it may do so in the presence of high - energy braneworld corrections to the friedmann equation , for example as found in the randall  sundrum type ii scenario . as the energy density decreases ,",
    "those corrections become unimportant , and the scalar field makes a transition into a kinetic energy dominated regime bringing inflation to an end . as the inflaton survives this process without decay , an alternative reheating mechanism is required .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed that reheating took place via gravitational particle production @xcite .",
    "however this brings problems to the scenario .",
    "because of the inefficiency of the process , there is a long kinetic energy dominated regime , which allows short - wavelength gravitational waves to reach excessive amplitudes @xcite .",
    "there are likely also to be problems with the low reheat temperature achieved , which is barely sufficient to allow standard nucleosynthesis to proceed .",
    "the scenario also suffers from a separate problem , which is that it tends to predict perturbation spectra which are too far from scale - invariance , and too high an amplitude of long - wavelength gravitational waves ; for the exponential potential the predicted spectra are in conflict with the most recent observations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that implementation of curvaton reheating in place of gravitational particle production can redress those difficulties .",
    "curvaton reheating can be much more efficient , allowing a high reheat temperature and preventing short - wavelength gravitational wave dominance .",
    "further , adiabatic perturbations produced via the curvaton may be closer to scale - invariance , and in particular the contribution of gravitational waves to the microwave anisotropies may be considerably suppressed .",
    "two related papers appeared as we were completing this work ; ref .",
    "@xcite discuss curvaton reheating in a quintessential inflation model @xcite in the standard cosmology , while ref .",
    "@xcite considers adding the curvaton to the steep inflation model , but focussing on particle physics model building aspects rather than observational phenomenology and constraints .",
    "a summary of this paper is as follows . in section  [ two ] , we review the main features of steep inflation in the braneworld scenario .",
    "we present only the main results of these kind of models , including the production of primordial gravitational waves . in section",
    "[ three ] , we study the evolution of a curvaton field and its perturbations in steep inflation , and we focus our attention on all the constraints to be applied upon the free parameters of the model .",
    "we consider separately the cases that arise depending on whether the curvaton field dominates after or before it decays into radiation . in section",
    "[ four ] we put all constraints together and analyze the parameter space of the model of curvaton field @xmath0 steep inflation which satisfies all the requirements . in the final section",
    "we draw some conclusions and topics to be investigated in future publications .",
    "in this section we give a brief description of an inflationary model in the braneworld scenario , assuming that the inflaton field is a minimally coupled real scalar field @xmath1 endowed with an exponential potential of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 are free parameters and @xmath4 with @xmath5 the planck mass .",
    "more details of the model can be found in refs .",
    "a somewhat related idea has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the @xmath6-dimensional brane scenario inspired by the randall  sundrum model ,",
    "the standard friedman equation is modified to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the brane tension and , taking the inflaton field to be the dominant component , @xmath9 .",
    "the scalar field is confined to the brane so that its equation of motion is the usual klein  gordon one @xmath10 where dots denote temporal derivatives .    for large energies",
    "@xmath11 , the inflaton field experiences an increased friction as it rolls down its potential , and then one can expect inflation to occur even for steep potentials ( i.e. even for @xmath12 ) .",
    "this can be seen from the slow - roll parameters for the exponential potential @xcite , which for large energies read @xmath13 and thus , inflation can occur whenever @xmath14 .",
    "the equations of motion can be solved exactly in the slow - roll approximation , from which we find the following expressions for the scale factor @xmath15 , the hubble factor @xmath16 and the inflaton field @xmath1 , respectively , @xmath17 here ` i(f ) ' indicates the initial ( final ) values of the different quantities during inflation , and @xmath18 is the number of @xmath19-foldings as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 2e5 ] ) . observe that , in the braneworld scenario , the slow - roll approximation for the exponential potential is a much better approximation than in standard cosmology .",
    "inflation ends by violation of the slow - roll conditions , when @xmath20 , and so the value of the potential energy at the end of inflation is @xmath21 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ 2e5])([2e7 ] ) , we find that the initial and final values of the hubble factor and the potential energy , respectively , are related through @xmath22 where @xmath23 so far the model has three free parameters , but only two of them are relevant for inflation , the brane tension @xmath8 and the self - interaction of the inflaton field @xmath24",
    ".    the amplitude of scalar density perturbations can be calculated for the exponential potential , and it is given by @xcite @xmath25 in the usual scenario of steep inflation , the values of the inflation parameters can be adjusted so that we get the observed value @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , we can determine the value of the brane tension in terms of @xmath24 as @xmath27 notice that any deviation of @xmath8 from the value obtained in eq .",
    "( [ 2e92 ] ) would imply either a larger or smaller amplitude for the scalar spectrum .    as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the number of @xmath19-foldings can be unambiguously determined for the exponential potential , for which we obtain @xmath28 .",
    "this result is based on eq .",
    "( [ 2e91 ] ) and is independent of the value of @xmath29 .",
    "soon after inflation ends , the brane term becomes unimportant and we recover the standard friedman equation .",
    "hence , the friction on the inflaton field diminishes and the inflaton energy is dominated by the kinetic term and the scalar energy density falls as stiff matter , @xmath30 . the epoch that follows",
    "is called the ` kinetic epoch ' or ` kination ' @xcite , and we shall use ` kin ' to label the value of the different quantities at the beginning of the kinetic epoch .    since we are now working within standard cosmology ( at energies @xmath31 ) , the hubble factor evolves as @xmath32 the kinetic regime does not commence immediately after the end of inflation , but the values of the hubble parameter at the end of inflation and at the beginning of the kinetic regime are related by the formula @xcite @xmath33    a small amount of radiation has been produced quantum - mechanically during inflation with an energy density @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of different species created from the vacuum . if the inflaton potential does not decay just after inflation , then this is the only mechanism to reheat the universe .    with the density of scalar matter falling more rapidly than that of radiation",
    ", the universe continues evolving according to eq .",
    "( [ 2e10 ] ) until the small amount of radiation comes to dominate .",
    "since the ratio of scalar matter to radiation at the end of inflation is large , @xmath36 , radiation comes to dominate the expansion of the universe only after a very long kinetic epoch .",
    "this is troublesome since the energy density of gravitational waves produced quantum - mechanically can exceed the nucleosynthesis constraints , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in braneworld inflation , the amplitude of gravitational waves @xmath37",
    "is enhanced with respect to the standard scenario , and its value at the end of inflation is given by @xmath38 gravitational waves behave as massless scalar fields and then their amplitude remains constant during inflation . during the kinetic epoch , the energy density of gravitational waves evolves as @xcite @xmath39 from this , the energy density of gravitational waves at the time of scalar stiff matter ",
    "radiation equality is @xmath40 thus , the energy density of gravitational waves on _ short wavelength scales _",
    "@xcite exceeds the contribution of radiation .",
    "it happens then that gravitational waves come to dominate the stiff scalar matter well before radiation , which in fact never dominates , and then nucleosynthesis constraints are not satisfied at all .",
    "therefore , the original steep inflation model seems to be ruled out @xcite .",
    "however , the production of gravitational waves can be kept under control if the kinetic epoch is shortened .",
    "the latter can be done either by a sufficiently early decay of the inflaton field or by having a post - inflationary equation of state softer than that of stiff matter .",
    "the latter picture is quite appealing since the surviving inflaton field could become part of the dark matter at late times @xcite .",
    "in this section we explore the possibility that the inflaton field is not responsible for providing the primordial fluctuations required for the formation of structure in the late universe , as in the case where the value of the brane tension is lower than that in eq .",
    "( [ 2e92 ] ) . instead",
    ", the primordial fluctuations are generated by a second scalar field @xmath41 , usually called the _ curvaton field _",
    ", through initially isocurvature perturbations @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we assume here that the curvaton field has a quadratic scalar potential @xmath42 , and hence obeys the klein ",
    "gordon equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the curvaton mass .",
    "we will now follow the evolution of the curvaton field through different stages and find the constraints upon the free parameters of the model in order to have a viable curvaton scenario together with steep inflation . in doing this",
    ", we shall follow a similar procedure to that in ref .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the dynamics .",
    "first of all , it is assumed that the curvaton field coexists with the inflaton field during inflation , during which the inflaton energy density is the dominant component .",
    "the curvaton field should survive the rapid expansion of the universe , and for that it has to be effectively massless . as we shall see below , this condition is translated into a constraint of the curvaton mass @xmath44 .",
    "if this constraint is satisfied , the curvaton field will remain constant to its initial value .",
    "the following stage is that when the curvaton field becomes effectively massive , and this will generally happen during the kinetic epoch . in order to prevent a period of curvaton - driven inflation",
    ", the universe must remain inflaton - dominated until this time .",
    "the latter condition imposes a constraint on the initial values the curvaton field can take , @xmath45 .",
    "once effectively massive , the curvaton field oscillates around the minimum of its potential and its energy density evolves as non - relativistic matter .",
    "the final stage is that of curvaton decay into radiation , and the standard big bang cosmology is recovered afterwards . in the general case ,",
    "curvaton decay should occur before nucleosynthesis , but other constraints arise depending on epoch of the decay , governed by the decay parameter @xmath46 .",
    "there are two scenarios to be considered , depending whether the curvaton field decays before or after it becomes the dominant component of the universe .",
    "whatever the case , the energy from gravitational waves should be maintained under control , which will actually become an extra constraint involving different parameters of the model .",
    "also , we calculate the curvaton perturbations for each case which will help us to reduce the number of free parameters . at this point , the gaussianity conditions on the perturbations will be taken into account too .",
    "the introduction of the curvaton field adds three free parameters to the steep inflation model : the curvaton mass @xmath44 , the initial value of the curvaton field @xmath45 and the curvaton decay parameter @xmath46 .",
    "however , a successful model needs to satisfy the conditions outlined above which are strong enough to restrict the allowed curvaton parameters .",
    "we first study the evolution of the curvaton field during braneworld inflation with an exponential inflaton potential as described in section  [ two ] .",

    "( [ 2e8 ] ) ) , the ratio of the final value of the curvaton field to its initial value is @xmath57    we see that the final value @xmath58 depends on the initial conditions .",
    "the interesting case is that in which the curvaton energy is equally distributed into kinetic and potential at the beginning of inflation , so that we can take @xmath59 .",
    "thus , from @xmath60 we obtain @xmath61 therefore , the condition @xmath62 makes the curvaton field remain constant under general initial conditions , and we can write @xmath63 . notice also that @xmath64 .",
    "as we anticipated at the beginning of this section , the dynamics of the curvaton field after inflation are different to the scenarios considered before in the literature .",
    "this difference is mainly because the curvaton field coexists with the surviving inflaton field , whose energy density is by far the dominant one at the end of inflation .",
    "the consequences of this will be explored in this section and our immediate concern will be to work out the corresponding gravitational wave constraint .    according to our hypothesis ,",
    "it is during the kinetic epoch that the curvaton field becomes effectively massive .",
    "this happens at a time when @xmath65 , from which we obtain ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2e10 ] ) ) @xmath66 where ` m ' labels the quantities at the time when the curvaton becomes massive .",
    "up to this point , the curvaton field remained effectively massless and we can consider that @xmath67 .    in order to prevent a period of curvaton - driven inflation , the universe must still be dominated by the scalar stiff - matter at this point .",

    ". the allowed region would be smaller for a smaller ( larger ) value of @xmath117 ( @xmath24).,width=321 ]    the different constraints permit some room for viable models , though the allowed region is smaller for smaller values of @xmath117 , i.e.  smaller values of @xmath8 , and for larger values of @xmath24 .",
    "then , we conclude that a realistic scenario in which the curvaton field decays before domination is very restricted by the different constraints .",
    "the steep inflation model is of interest as it ends inflation in a novel manner , through reduction of inflation - sustaining braneworld corrections , and because it generates inflation from the steep exponential potentials often found in supergravity phenomenology .",
    "unfortunately , the original steep inflation model appears unable to match observations , due to an excessive amplitude of short - scale gravitational waves and because its perturbations are not close enough to scale - invariance .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that curvaton reheating can alleviate these difficulties , by dramatically raising the reheat temperature ( as compared to gravitational particle production reheating ) , while simultaneously suppressing the large - angle gravitational wave contribution .",
    "the model is subject to a complex network of constraints , but viable models do exist , provided the brane tension @xmath8 and the exponential slope @xmath24 are not too large . we should stress that our analysis applies only to the case where the inflaton survives until late times , since an early decay of the inflaton field would lead to the standard scenario already studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the steep inflation model is that the inflaton field may survive to the present , and with suitable modification of the potential from its exponential form at low energies it could act as either dark matter @xcite or quintessence @xcite .",
    "this resembles the scenarios given in ref .",
    "@xcite concerning residual isocurvature matter perturbations .",
    "for instance , if cold dark matter is created before curvaton decay , then there is a maximal correlation between curvature and cdm - isocurvature perturbations which is at variance with current observations .",
    "we expect that the inflaton perturbations would be affected in the same way if the inflaton field is to be the dark matter at late times .",
    "the case of quintessence should not be troublesome , since the quintessence perturbations should decay upon horizon entry .",
    "however these situations merit more detailed investigation .",
