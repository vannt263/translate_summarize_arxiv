    "flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are forbidden at tree level in the standard model ( sm ) . however , they could be present at one loop level as in the case of @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite etc . in general , many extensions of the sm permit , however fcnc at tree level .",
    "the introduction of new representations of fermions different from doublets produce them by means of the z - coupling @xcite .",
    "in addition , they are generated at tree level in the yukawa sector by adding a second doublet to the sm @xcite .",
    "such couplings also appear in susy theories without r - parity @xcite .",
    "theories with fcnc were previously considered unatractive because they were strongly constrained experimentally , especially due to the small @xmath10mass difference .",
    "nevertheless , nowadays it is hoped to observe such physical processes in laboratory , as a result many theories were proposed ( see above ) .",
    "owing to the continuous improvements in experimental accuracies , lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) has become a very important possible source of new physics .",
    "experiments to search directly for lfv have been performed for many years , all with null results so far .",
    "experimental limits have resulted from searches for @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "there are several mechanisms to avoid fcnc at tree level .",
    "glashow and weinberg @xcite proposed a discrete symmetry in the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) which forbids the couplings that generate such rare decays , hence they do not appear at tree level .",
    "another possibility is to consider heavy exchange of scalar or pseudoscalar higgs fields @xcite or by cancellation of large contributions with opposite sign .",
    "another mechanism was proposed by cheng and sher arguing that a natural value for the fc couplings from different families should be of the order of the geometric average of their yukawa couplings @xcite .    taking this _ natural _ assumption and",
    "since yukawa couplings in the sm vary with mass , it is plausible that the same occurs for fc couplings .",
    "hence it is expected that fcnc involving the third generation can be larger , while the ones involving the first generation are hoped to be small @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another clue that suggests large mixing between the second and third generation in the charged leptonic sector , is the large mixing between second and third generation of the neutral leptonic sector .",
    "this is predicted by experiments with atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the increasing interest in lfv processes is due to the strong restrictions that experiments have imposed on them .",
    "this consequently determines small regions of parameters for new physics of any theory beyond the sm .",
    "some specific decays have been widely studied within the framework of supersymmetric extensions , because in supersymmetric theories the presence of fcnc induced by r - parity violation generates massive neutrinos and neutrino oscillations @xcite . in recent papers",
    "the decays @xmath17and @xmath18with polarized muons have been examined in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories to get bounds in the @xmath19plane @xcite .    on the other hand , a muon collider could provide very interesting new constraints on fcnc , for example @xmath20 mediated by higgs exchange @xcite which test the mixing between the second and third generations .",
    "additionally , the muon collider could be a higgs factory and it is well known that the higgs sector is crucial for fcnc @xcite . finally , effects on the coupling of muon and tau in the 2hdm framework owing to anomalous magnetic moment of the muon could be significantly improved by e821 experiment at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the quark sector bounds on lfv come from @xmath21 processes , rare b - decays , @xmath22 and the @xmath23-parameter @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite also explored the implications of fcnc at tree level for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , there are other important processes involving fcnc . for instance , the decay @xmath28 which depends on @xmath29mixing and vanishes in the sm .",
    "hence it is very sensitive to new physics .",
    "another one is @xmath30whose form factors have been calculated in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the simplest model which exhibits fcnc at tree level is the model with one extra higgs doublet , known as the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "there are several kinds of such models . in the model type",
    "i , one higgs doublet provides masses to the up and down quarks , simultaneously . in the model type ii ,",
    "one higgs doublet gives masses to the up quarks and the other one to the down quarks .",
    "these former two models have the discrete symmetry mentioned above to avoid fcnc at tree level @xcite . however , the discrete symmetry is not necessary in whose case both doublets generate the masses of the quarks of up - type and down - type , simultaneously . in the literature ,",
    "the latter is known as the model type iii @xcite .",
    "it has been used to look for physics beyond the sm and specifically for fcnc at tree level @xcite , @xcite . in general , both doublets could acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , but we can absorb one of them redefining the higgs fields properly . nevertheless , we shall show that a substantial difference arises from the case in which both doublets get the vev , and therefore we will study the model type iii considering two cases . in the first case ,",
    "the two higgs doublets acquire vev ( case ( a ) ) . in the second",
    "one , only one higgs doublet acquire vev ( case ( b ) ) .",
    "in the latter case the free parameter @xmath31  is removed from the theory making the analysis simpler .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the model and define the notation we shall use throughout the document . in section iii , we show that we can make two kinds of rotations for the flavor mixing matrices which generates four types of lagrangians , and that in the framework of the first rotation we arrive to the case ( b ) from the case ( a ) in the limit @xmath32 , while with the second rotation we obtain ( b ) from ( a ) in the limit @xmath33furthermore , we find that two of the four possible lagrangians correspond to the models of types i and ii plus flavor changing ( fc ) interactions .    in section iv we get bounds on lfv in the 2hdm type iii based on the decays @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "such decays are examined in the framework of both cases ( a ) and ( b ) according to the classification made above , and with both types of rotations .",
    "we find that such constraints depend on whether we use cases ( a ) or ( b ) and on what kind of rotation is utilized .",
    "the 2hdm type iii is an extension of the sm plus a new higgs doublet and three new yukawa couplings in the quark and leptonic sectors .",
    "the mass terms for the up - type or down - type sectors depends on two matrices or two yukawa couplings .",
    "the rotation of the quarks and leptons allows us to diagonalize one of the matrices but not both simultaneously , so one of the yukawa couplings remains non - diagonal , generating the fcnc at tree level .",
    "the yukawa s lagrangian is as follow @xmath36 where @xmath37are the higgs doublets,@xmath38and @xmath39 are non - diagonal @xmath40non - dimensional matrices and @xmath41 , @xmath42 are family indices .",

    "( a ) we assume the vev as @xmath50 and we take the complex phase of @xmath51equal to zero since we are not interested in cp violation .",

    "now , by using the experimental upper bounds for lfv processes @xcite",

    "in the present work we examine a 2hdm type iii which produces fcnc at tree level in the leptonic sector .",
    "we classified the model type iii according to the vev taken by the higgses and to the method used to rotate the mixing matrices .",
    "all that , in order to write down the lagrangian in the mass eigenstates . when both doublets acquire a vev we talk about the case ( a ) , while when only one doublet acquire a vev we talk about the case ( b ) .",
    "on the other hand , when we write @xmath132 in terms of @xmath133 plus the mass matrices , it is called here a rotation of type i. where @xmath132 are the mixing matrices which couple to @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively and @xmath77 are the fc matrices which couple to @xmath63and @xmath136 respectively . now , when we solve for @xmath77 in terms of @xmath132 and the mass matrices we call it a rotation of type ii .",
    "in addition , we observe that the 2hdm of type i plus fc interactions is generated by adding the lagrangian of type ( a , i ) in the up sector and the lagrangian of type ( a , i ) in the down sector , meanwhile the lagrangian of type ii plus fc interactions is generated by adding the lagrangian of type ( a , i ) in the up sector and the lagrangian of type ( a , ii ) in the down sector .",
    "other two combinations are possible i.e. @xmath137 and @xmath138 . moreover ,",
    "if we began with a lagrangian of type ( a , i ) we would obtain the lagrangian ( b , i ) taking the limit @xmath139 while if we started with a lagrangian of type ( a , ii ) we would obtain the lagrangian ( b , ii ) in the limit @xmath140 .    to illustrate the importance of this classification we show graphics to find bounds on the fc coupling @xmath112 coming from the process @xmath17and we realize that such bounds are sensitive to the type of rotation and also to the structure of the vev .",
    "we also calculate the process @xmath141 for both kind of rotations but the constraints obtained were less restrictive than the ones obtained with the process @xmath142 .",
    "finally , to evaluate such bounds we have used a muon running in the loop for the process @xmath102instead of a tau as usual .",
    "consequently , we plot the quotient @xmath143 in terms of @xmath144and @xmath145 , getting a wide range of allowed values for that quotient , showing that this assumption is reasonable .",
