    "leptons and photons are penetrating probes of the hot , dense medium since they are not affected by the strong interaction and therefore they can probe the whole evolution of the collision .    in the low invariant mass range of produced lepton pairs ( @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 ) , we can study vector meson in - medium properties through their dilepton decays , where modifications of mass and width of the spectral functions observed may relate to the possibility of chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite .",

    "a similar conclusion holds for @xmath7 collisions at lhc energies  @xcite .",

    "the precise na60 measurement of the low mass enhancement provides a decisive discrimination between the dropping - mass scenario  @xcite and the massively broadened spectral function  @xcite .",
    "the latter one was found to be able to describe the data consistently .    at rhic ,",
    "the phenix experiment observed a significant enhancement in the @xmath12 data above the expectation from hadronic sources for @xmath13 gev/@xmath1 and @xmath14 gev/@xmath6 in 200 gev au+au collisions  @xcite .",

    "dilepton spectra in the intermediate mass range are directly related to the thermal radiation of the qgp  @xcite .",
