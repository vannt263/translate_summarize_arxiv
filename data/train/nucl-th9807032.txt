    "with recent progress in developing and using effective field theories , a practical knowledge of various low - energy parameters of hadrons and their interactions is of high current interest . among such parameters",

    "two linear combinations of @xmath7 have an especially transparent meaning .",
    "these are the forward and backward spin polarizabilities , @xmath8 and @xmath0 , which are defined as the coefficients of @xmath9 in the structure - dependent ( non - born ) part of the low - energy forward or backward compton scattering amplitude . from the gell - mann  goldberger  thirring dispersion relation",
    ", one can predict the forward spin polarizability @xmath8 through the total photoabsorption cross sections with polarized beam and target with total helicities 1/2 and 3/2 @xcite : [ gamma ] = _ _ 0^ ( _ 1/2 - _ 3/2 ) . using more complicated dispersion relations , two other @xmath8 s",
    "can also be found @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is not sufficient to predict the backward spin polarizability which is particularly sensitive to that part of the high - energy behavior of the spin - dependent compton scattering amplitude driven by the invariant amplitude @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a dispersion estimate for @xmath0 obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite using an unsubtracted fixed-@xmath3 dispersion relation for @xmath10 was based on the strong assumption that the high - energy asymptotics of @xmath10 are entirely determined by @xmath11 exchange @xcite , whereas other possible exchanges with heavier mesons or few - pion states are negligible .",
    "although not well justified , this estimate still gives a result close to that obtained in the framework of leading order chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , with the @xmath12-isobar included through the small - energy - scale expansion @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found for the proton [ th ] [ _ ] _ p = -36.7  @xcite , -34.3  @xcite , -37.2  @xcite ( hereafter the units used for @xmath8 s are @xmath13 ) . in all these calculations , the magnitude of @xmath0 is dominated by the contribution to nucleon compton scattering from the @xmath3-channel @xmath11-exchange which yields [ pi0 ] _ ^(^0 ) = _ 3 = ( -45.01.6)_3 , where @xmath14 is the nucleon mass and @xmath15 is equal to 1 or @xmath16 for the proton or neutron , respectively .",
    "experimental @xmath17 and @xmath18 couplings extrapolated to @xmath19 were taken to obtain the numerical value of @xmath20 . in the framework of chpt , @xmath21 .",
    "recently , these theoretical predictions have been challenged by the first experimental estimate of the backward spin polarizability of the proton @xcite which was ( indirectly ) obtained from a simultaneous analysis of pion photoproduction and unpolarized compton scattering data : [ exp ] [ _ ] _ p = -27.1 3.4 , where statistical , systematic , and model - dependent errors were added in quadrature .",
    "isolating the well - defined contribution ( [ pi0 ] ) with errors already included in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , one can infer the non-@xmath11 part of the backward spin polarizability which is of the most theoretical interest : [ exp0 ] [ _ ^(non-^0)]_p = 17.9 3.4 . on the other hand ,",
    "all the cited theoretical approaches yield roughly one half of eq .",
    "( [ exp0 ] ) , with @xmath22 coming from nonresonant pion production and another @xmath22 from the @xmath12-resonance excitation .",
    "therefore , the experimental finding ( [ exp0 ] ) suggests that there is another missing and very large positive contribution to @xmath0 . in the framework of chpt , this missing contribution might be due to next - to - leading - order effects , especially in the related counter - terms . in the framework of fixed-@xmath3 dispersion relations ,",
    "the missing contribution could be sought in the high - energy part of the poorly - convergent dispersion relation for the amplitude @xmath10 or in heavy - meson exchanges which might contribute to @xmath23 at large @xmath1 and @xmath19 .    neither an extension of the chpt calculations to higher orders nor a more exact treatment of the high - energy behavior of @xmath10 offer much promise to resolve this issue , since both approaches are technically difficult and suffer from badly - controlled uncertainties .",
    "therefore we develop here a different approach based on a backward - angle dispersion relation which is manifestly free from the convergence problem .",
    "this approach is very similar to that proposed for determining the difference of dipole electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "we derive a sum rule for @xmath0 with well - defined @xmath1- and @xmath3-channel contributions and then use it to predict the backward spin polarizability of the nucleon .",
    "we start by recalling the form of dispersion relations for nucleon compton scattering amplitudes at the fixed scattering angle @xmath24 @xcite . at this specific angle ,",
    "the corresponding mandelstam variables obey two constraints , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the structure of physical cuts in the complex plane of @xmath1 is particularly simple .",

    "we apply the backward dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) to the function [ a ] a a_2 + ( 1-)a_5 , where @xmath35 are cross - even invariant amplitudes of compton scattering @xcite free from kinematical singularities and constraints .",

    "such a high - energy behavior of @xmath36 guarantees convergence of the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) .    in the born approximation , which is determined by the electric charge @xmath47 and the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath48 of the nucleon ,",
