    "mechanisms for formation of heavy quasiparticles in this strongly correlated electronic system are still under debate  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore lattice is likely to be a crucial aspect of the problem . @xcite the frustration can be directly related to the suppression of a long - range magnetic order at any @xmath12 and instead",
    ", the system is close to a magnetic instability .",
    "thus , the enhanced low - energy dynamic spin fluctuations are expected to influence considerably the low-@xmath12 properties of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 , leading to formation of hf behavior .",
    "low-@xmath15 spin fluctuations in liv@xmath1o@xmath2 were studied in a series of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements ,  @xcite as well as in nmr experiments  @xcite in a wide range of temperatures from 0.5 to @xmath19k . in ins measurements on polycrystalline samples of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 at low temperatures , @xmath20 2k , short - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations with a characteristic relaxation rate @xmath211mev in a broad region of wavevectors around @xmath22 0.6 @xmath6",
    "were observed . as the temperature is increased above 2k ( to @xmath23k and higher ) ,",
    "the integrated scattering intensity at low energy transfer @xmath241mev was found to be shifted toward low @xmath25 values .",
    "this indicates that short - range afm correlations get suppressed in favor of those located near the brillouin zone ( bz ) center .    at a momentum transfer @xmath25 ,",
    "the measured integrated intensity is defined as @xmath26 here , @xmath270.2mev is the lowest resolved energy transfer and the upper limit @xmath281mev restricts the low-@xmath15 region of interest . in ( [ a1 ] ) the dynamical structure factor has a familiar form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dynamic spin susceptibility . for this we choose a single - pole description @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the temperature dependent static spin susceptibility and the spin relaxation rate , respectively .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that a single lorentzian spectral form of nearly critical spin fluctuations corresponding to the eq.([a3 ] ) provides an adequate description of low - temperature ins data  @xcite in liv@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "our previous study  @xcite of spin fluctuations in strongly correlated itinerant electron system liv@xmath1o@xmath2 was carried out at @xmath34 within the rpa approach based on the realistic electronic band structure of this material .",
    "the theory suggests that the spinel liv@xmath1o@xmath2 is near to a magnetic instability and possesses a rather unusual paramagnetic ground state : the pronounced low-@xmath15 spin fluctuations are located in @xmath25-space in the vicinity of the `` critical '' @xmath35-surface with a mean radius @xmath36 0.6 @xmath6 , fig.7 in ref .",
    "the suggested strong degeneracy of `` critical '' wave vectors @xmath35 means that on approaching a magnetic instability the system can not choose a unique wave vector of a magnetic structure which minimize the free energy of spin fluctuations .",
    "instead , it is frustrated between different structures with different wave vectors and equally low free energy .    for powder samples of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 measured  @xcite at @xmath37k , all the `` critical '' spin fluctuations at @xmath38",
    "contribute because of the angle averaging at a given @xmath39 and the corresponding low-@xmath15 scattering intensity @xmath40 dominates ; for instance @xmath41 , where small values of @xmath14 around the bz center are implied .",
    "as mentioned above , experiment shows that with increasing temperature the small @xmath14 intensity @xmath16 grows fast and for @xmath42k tends to be dominant .",
    "so far , a detailed explanation for the reversal of the ratio @xmath43 with increasing @xmath12 is still lacking .    the purpose of the present work is two - fold .",
    "first , we aim to give an explanation for the observed shift of the ins intensity under warming .",
    "our argumentation is based on the markedly different temperature evolutions of `` critical '' spin fluctuations at @xmath44 and those at small @xmath25 .",
    "second , to extend our previous rpa study of spin fluctuations at @xmath45 in liv@xmath1o@xmath2 to finite temperatures , in the present work one step beyond the rpa theory is made . in the extended theory , known as the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory of spin fluctuations ,  @xcite leading corrections to the inverse rpa spin susceptibility @xmath46",
    "are included to involve effects of spin fluctuation interactions in a self - consistent manner .",
    "one aspect that distinguishes considerably the scr theory applied here for liv@xmath1o@xmath2 from the earlier applications of this theory to other electronic systems near magnetic instabilities has to be especially emphasized . as suggested in  @xcite and outlined above , it is a rather unusual distribution in @xmath25-space of slow `` critical '' spin fluctuations that dominate the paramagnetic behavior of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "based on the present scr theory , a phenomenological description for the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath47 measured by ins  @xcite is developed . as shown below",
    ", the properly parametrized scr theory is capable in giving at low temperatures a satisfactory fit to the experimentally observed @xmath12-dependences of both the static susceptibility @xmath48 and the relaxation rate @xmath9 for the `` critical '' spin fluctuations .",
    "focusing on the wave vector region at @xmath49 , where spin fluctuations are highly enhanced at low @xmath12 , within the scr theory a temperature dependence of the static spin susceptibility @xmath32 is described by the following equation  @xcite ( @xmath50 ):    @xmath51    here @xmath52 is the static susceptibility for non - interacting electrons .",
    "the term @xmath53 takes into account electron correlations in the rpa approximation , where the parameter @xmath54 is the on - site electron repulsion in an effective hubbard model .",
    "thus , first two terms on the right - hand side of eq.([a4 ] ) give the inverse rpa spin susceptibility @xmath55 . a weak @xmath12-dependence of @xmath56 is brought about by the fermi distribution function entering the generalized lindhard function @xmath52 . in the low-@xmath12 range of interest ,",
    "the corresponding temperature corrections are controlled by the extremely small quantity @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the fermi energy , and thus can be neglected .",
    "primarily , a temperature variation of @xmath32 is induced by the last term on the right - hand side of eq.([a4 ] ) due to mode - mode coupling of spin fluctuations .",
    "the coupling strength is given by the constant @xmath59 .",
    "the spectral intensity @xmath60 is dominated by spin fluctuations at @xmath49 characterized by @xmath48 and a set of complementary parameters .",
    "the procedure is developed in the next section , where eq.([a4 ] ) at @xmath61 takes a form of a parametrized integral equation for @xmath48 .    with the use of the decomposition @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the bose distribution function , the last term in eq.([a4 ] )",
    "can be split into two parts .",
    "the first gives a contribution from zero point fluctuations with the main effect of renormalizing the parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the second part involving @xmath63 gives the explicit and dominant @xmath12-dependence of @xmath32 ; at @xmath45 this contribution to @xmath65 is zero .",
    "@xmath66 now eq.([a4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath67 where @xmath68 ; @xmath69 is the number of primitive cells in the sample volume .",
    "the @xmath25-summation is over the bz of the fcc lattice inherent to the pyrochlore lattice of the magnetic v - ions in the spinel structure of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath32 means the spin susceptibility calculated per primitive cell ( 4 v - atoms ) .    in eq.([a6 ] ) the integral quantity @xmath70 has , up to a constant factor , a meaning of the mean square amplitude of the thermally induced spin fluctuations ; @xmath71 is a monotonically growing function of @xmath12 with the property @xmath72 .    at the next step ,",
    "the imaginary part of the dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath30 entering eq.([a6 ] ) and a distribution in @xmath25-space of dominant spin fluctuations have to be specified with more detail .",
    "in ins measurements  @xcite on powder samples of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 , highly enhanced spin fluctuations were detected at `` critical '' wave vectors of the length @xmath730.6 @xmath6 .",
    "however , a direction of @xmath35 remained unknown . in a subsequent theoretical study  @xcite ,",
    "the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath74 was calculated at @xmath45 for the realistic band structure of the itinerant electron paramagnet liv@xmath1o@xmath2 with local on - site electron interactions treated in the rpa approach .",
    "the calculations of @xmath74 performed along high - symmetry directions in @xmath25-space revealed that for each of the tested @xmath25-directions , strongly enhanced spin fluctuations occur at a wave vector @xmath75 of the length close to the experimentally measured `` critical '' one , @xmath760.6 @xmath6 .",
    "the end points of the calculated wave vector manifold @xmath77 can be viewed as lying on a closed surface called  @xcite the `` critical '' @xmath35-surface .",
    "it can be approximated with a polyhedron surface formed by edge - sharing polygons in such a way that the end point of a particular @xmath75 is the @xmath78-th polygon center .",
    "below the manifold of @xmath75 is denoted as @xmath79 and a prescription @xmath61 would mean that any of @xmath75 can be taken for @xmath25 .",
    "the sum over bz entering the expressions ( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a7 ] ) can be now expanded in the following way @xmath80 where each @xmath81-summation is over the @xmath25-states inside the @xmath78-th 3d wedge associated with a wavevector @xmath75 .",
    "the origin @xmath82 is placed at the center of the @xmath78-th polygon on the `` critical '' surface .",
    "the @xmath81-regions near the @xmath83-surface are characterized by `` critical '' , i.e. strongly enhanced and slow spin fluctuations which provide the main contribution to @xmath71 , eq.([a7 ] ) .    with the set of normals @xmath84 to the @xmath83-surface ,",
    "one may write down @xmath85 ; near @xmath83 the two - component vectors @xmath86 are confined to the @xmath78-th polygon .",
    "we suggest the following expansion of the dynamic spin susceptibility for low @xmath15 and near the @xmath35-surface : @xmath87 where @xmath88 . the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 are assumed to be @xmath12-independent in the low-@xmath12 region where the scr theory is valid .",
    "the expansion ( [ a10 ] ) is compatible with our previous study  @xcite and presents a further development of the model along the way proposed there .",
    "a peculiar property of the suggested model of `` critical '' spin fluctuations in liv@xmath1o@xmath2 is their strongly anisotropic character : the dispersion ( @xmath91 ) in the direction parallel to the normals @xmath92 to the @xmath35-surface is much smaller than that ( @xmath93 ) in the perpendicular directions .",
    "this property is verified in the next section by showing that a better fit of the calculated model results to ins experimental data is achieved with the anisotropy parameter @xmath94 tending to zero .",
    "let us consider eq.([a6 ] ) taken for @xmath61 .",
    "note that the coupling constant @xmath95 is assumed to be degenerate in the set of @xmath77 and , hence , can be denoted as @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , any @xmath97 from the @xmath98 manifold obeys the same equation . with the use of ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a10 ] ) , this leads to the explicit equation for @xmath99 that must be solved self - consistently .    in the present form",
    ", the scr theory is parametrized with five parameters , @xmath100 and @xmath96 . at the final stage",
    ", we put the theory on a quantitative ground by adjusting the parameter values when comparing the calculated model results with experimental ins data  @xcite for the spin susceptibility in liv@xmath1o@xmath2 .    to be close to the standard notation of the scr theory  @xcite",
    ", we introduce , instead of @xmath101 and @xmath90 , the following parameters @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the effective radius of the bz boundary given in terms of a primitive cell volume @xmath104 as @xmath105 .",
    "next , the reduced inverse susceptibility at @xmath106 is defined as @xmath107 with these notation one obtains @xmath108 ^ 2 + \\left(\\omega/2\\pi t_0\\right)^2 } , \\label{a13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 .",
    "below , when performing in ( [ a9 ] ) the summation over @xmath81 and @xmath78 , two dimensionless cutoff numbers , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are introduced . for the former we take @xmath111 , which distinguishes the region of `` critical '' spin fluctuations from that with small @xmath14 ones .",
    "the latter has a meaning of a square dimensionless _",

    "a value of the remaining integral over @xmath122 , where the subscript @xmath78 denotes a polygon number , does not depend on @xmath78 . in the resulting integral expression for @xmath123 the @xmath78-summation enters as a common factor @xmath114 .",
    "finally , we arrive at the following equation for the reduced inverse susceptibility  @xcite @xmath124 with @xmath125 the choice for @xmath126 in ( [ a17 ] ) is justified earlier .",
    "provided the parameter values of @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are fixed as discussed below , the appearance of a solution of eq.([a16 ] ) for @xmath130 as a function of @xmath131 is checked to be qualitatively insensitive to a variation of @xmath126 .",
    "beside the basic equation ( [ a16 ] ) , the present scr theory includes a set of five parameters which are now denoted as @xmath127 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the parameters @xmath132 and @xmath133 characterize , at @xmath3 , the momentum and frequency spread of `` critical '' spin fluctuations , @xmath128 is the effective mode - mode coupling constant and @xmath129 is a measure of the anisotropy of the spin fluctuation dispersion in @xmath25-space .",
    "given that the scr theory provides an expected reasonable approach to a description of ins data  @xcite , the parameter values can be safely estimated with a fit procedure .",
    "in a single - pole approximation ( [ a3 ] ) to the dynamic spin susceptibility , temperature evolution of `` critical '' spin fluctuations is entirely described by @xmath12-dependences of the static spin susceptibility @xmath99 and the spin relaxation rate @xmath134 .",
    "our aim now is to give a phenomenological description of @xmath99 and @xmath134 measured in ins experiment  @xcite in terms of the parametrized scr theory developed in the proceeding sections .",
    "let us first note that the expansion ( [ a10 ] ) can be rewritten in the form ( [ a3 ] ) , which leads to the following relations @xmath135 ^ 2 +   b\\left [ { \\bf q}^{\\bot}/\\kappa_q\\left(t\\right ) \\right]^2 } , \\label{a20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath136 ^ 2 +   b\\left [ { \\bf q}^{\\bot}/\\kappa_q\\left(t\\right ) \\right]^2\\right ) , \\label{a21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath137    @xmath138    by using the ins estimates  @xcite for the inverse correlation length @xmath1390.16 @xmath6 ( at @xmath1400.6 @xmath6 ) and the spin relaxation rate @xmath141mev , and recalling that @xmath1420.76 @xmath6 , one obtains from eqs.([a21 ] ) and ( [ a22 ] ) the following parameter values @xmath143    next , having the ratio @xmath1444 reported in ref .

    "provided the values of @xmath127 and @xmath133 are kept as in ( [ a24 ] ) , variation of @xmath128 and @xmath129 around the selected values , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , would lead to a smooth modification of a curvature of the solution @xmath130 presented in the upper panel of fig.1 . with respect to the anisotropy parameter @xmath129 , we found a better coincidence , mostly for @xmath11k , between the theory and experiment by sending @xmath153 to smaller values and we adopt the value @xmath151 as the most representative one .",
    "thus , with @xmath128 and @xmath129 values indicated above , the best overall fit to experimental data for @xmath99 and @xmath154 is achieved . as expected ,",
    "a better agreement between the theory and experiment is reached in the low temperature region , @xmath155k , while for @xmath11k only main trends in @xmath12-dependences of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are reproduced by the present theory . actually , `` critical '' spin fluctuations at @xmath44 , being dominant at @xmath3 , get suppressed with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "this means that , as @xmath12 becomes high enough , the spectral density @xmath156 integrated over the whole bz , eq.([a6 ] ) , is no more dominated by fluctuation modes at @xmath10 only , and contributions of other modes , more likely those at small @xmath14 , have to be involved in a more complete theory .",
    "to compare the ins intensities at @xmath49 and @xmath157 and their evolution with temperature , let us start with examining of @xmath12-dependences of @xmath158 and @xmath159 entering the expression ( [ a3 ] ) for the small-@xmath25 and low-@xmath15 dynamic spin susceptibility .",
    "first , one may relate the small-@xmath25 quantities @xmath158 and @xmath159 in a similar way as done in preceding section for @xmath49 , with the use of the following expansion @xmath160 the extra factor @xmath161 in the last term of eq.([a26 ] ) arises since the uniform magnetization is a constant of motion .",

    "actually , as temperature increases from @xmath166k up to @xmath167k , the value of @xmath99 drops by a factor of 4 , while about a twenty percent decrease in @xmath165 is observed only as seen in fig.1 .",
    "these preliminaries enable us now to give an account for a temperature variation of the ratio @xmath43 . here",
    ", the integrated low-@xmath15 ins intensities are defined as in eqs.([a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , and small , but finite wave vectors @xmath25 near the bz center are implied in @xmath16 .    both for @xmath10 and small @xmath14 , in the low-@xmath15 limit the imaginary part of the dynamic spin susceptibility ( [ a3 ] ) can be approximated as @xmath168 , and for finite temperatures , @xmath169 , the temperature - balance factor in ( [ a2 ] ) can be approximately replaced as follows : @xmath170 .",
    "then , with the use of ( [ a20])-([a23 ] ) and ( [ a27])-([a29 ] ) one obtains @xmath171 ^ 2 . \\label{a30}\\",

    "further , as @xmath12 is elevated gradually , the decrease of @xmath176 , together with a relatively weak variation of @xmath165 , is resulted for the last term in eq.([a30 ] ) in a fast decreasing function of @xmath12 such that @xmath177 ^ 2\\approx 1 $ ] at @xmath167k .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath43 is reduced by almost a factor of 16 .",
    "the results of the this section can be comprehended as follows . for small @xmath25 , the low-@xmath15 scattering intensity increases with @xmath12 mainly due to the thermal - balance factor entering the expression ( [ a2 ] ) because the static spin susceptibility @xmath32 and the relaxation rate @xmath33 as functions of @xmath12 are slowly varying observables for @xmath178k .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath179 the thermal - balance factor increase is cancelled out because of ( _ i _ ) a fast decrease with @xmath12 of the static spin suceptibility @xmath48 and ( _ ii _ ) a concomitant shifting of the spectral intensity to higher frequencies .",
    "the latter means a fast increase with @xmath12 of the spin relaxation rate @xmath180 measured at @xmath181 , which is in our analysis related to a fast temperature decrease of @xmath48 .",
    "this markedly distinct temperature behavior of spin fluctuations located in different regions of @xmath25 space manifests itself in a shift of the dominant low-@xmath15 ins intensity from @xmath10 at @xmath166k to small @xmath14 near the bz center for @xmath42k .",
    "like in many strongly correlated metallic systems , including heavy fermion compounds and high-@xmath182 cuprates , that are close to magnetic instabilities at @xmath3 , the pronounced slow spin fluctuations are suggested to influence considerably low-@xmath12 properties of the paramagnetic spinel liv@xmath1o@xmath2 as well . in the present work one step beyond the rpa theory",
    "was made and effects of spin fluctuation interactions were involved in the form of the scr theory . on this ground , a phenomenological description of the experimentally observed temperature variation of the dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath183 for the dominant `` critical '' spin fluctuations was developed .",
    "a special feature of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 which distinguishes the present scr theory from its earlier applications to other electronic systems near magnetic instabilities is a peculiar distribution in @xmath25 space of low-@xmath15 `` critical '' spin fluctuations dominating the paramagnetic state of liv@xmath1o@xmath2 in the limit @xmath3 .",
