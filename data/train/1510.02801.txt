    "the standard model of cosmology and particle physics provides our current best physical description of the universe .",
    "two of the most remarkable predictions of this model , now experimentally confirmed , include the production of the lightest chemical elements during the first minutes after the big bang ( known as big bang nucleosynthesis , or bbn ; @xcite ) , and the existence of a relic cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite .",
    "seconds after the big bang , ordinary matter consisted mostly of free neutrons and protons .",
    "as the universe expanded and cooled , some neutrons and protons combined to form deuterium ( d ) ; soon after , bbn entered full production .",
    "nearly all of the deuterium nuclei were fused to form the more tightly bound helium-4 ( @xmath4he ) nuclide .",
    "other light nuclides were also produced , but in much lower abundance , including the lighter isotope of helium ( @xmath5he ) and a very small amount of lithium-7 ( @xmath6li ) .",
    "after @xmath7 minutes , the nuclear reactions were quenched by the declining temperature and density of the universe , and bbn was complete ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the relative abundances of the primordial nuclides produced during bbn are sensitive to the universal expansion rate , and the cosmic density of ordinary matter ( i.e. the cosmic baryon density , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the expansion rate is set by the total energy density of cmb photons and relativistic particles , which for the standard model includes electrons , positrons and three flavors of neutrino .",
    "typically , the various contributions to the expansion rate are collected and parameterized by an `` effective number of neutrino species '' , @xmath1 , where the standard model value corresponds to @xmath1  @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "deviations from this value could indicate new physics not presently captured by the standard model .",
    "the dependence of each primordial element ratio on @xmath8  and @xmath1  can be determined from detailed numerical calculations of bbn .",
    "historically , each primordial nuclide is compared relative to hydrogen .",
    "for example , the primordial deuterium abundance ( d / h ) has commonly been used to estimate the cosmic baryon density @xcite , while the mass fraction of all baryons consisting of @xmath10he ( y@xmath11 ) depends strongly on @xmath1and is relatively insensitive to @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "similar measurements of @xmath8  and @xmath1  are also available through a careful analysis of the cmb temperature fluctuations , recently recorded in exquisite detail by the @xcite .",
    "their analysis provides @xmath12(cmb )  @xmath13 and @xmath1(cmb )  @xmath14 ( 95 per cent confidence limits ) , where @xmath15 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath16 .",
    "recent measurements of d / h @xcite provide an independent bound on @xmath12(bbn ) that is in good agreement with the values determined from the cmb . however , the latest measurements of y@xmath11suggest tentative , but inconclusive evidence favoring @xmath1(bbn )  @xmath17  @xmath1(cmb ) .",
    "specifically , the standard model value of the primordial @xmath4he mass fraction , inferred from the cmb , is y@xmath11  @xmath18 ( 68 per cent confidence limits ; @xcite ) . a recent survey conducted by @xcite found y@xmath11  @xmath19 , which constitutes a @xmath20 deviation from the standard model expectation . using a subset of the @xcite survey data",
    ", @xcite derived a value y@xmath11  @xmath21 , which is more consistent with the standard model .",
    "thus , the different values of y@xmath11  derived by these authors might be due to systematic differences in the analysis strategies adopted .    at present , it is unclear if additional , unaccounted for systematic uncertainties are biasing the best measurements of y@xmath11 , and therefore masquerading as non - standard physics ( see e.g. figure  8 from @xcite ) . to alleviate this concern , a new",
    ", sensitive and reliable probe is required to complement the measurement of y@xmath11  in the search for possible departures from standard bbn . until now",
    ", the power of combining measurements of the primordial d / h and @xmath0  ratios has not been fully appreciated .    in this letter",
    ", i investigate the sensitivity and observational prospects for uncovering new physics beyond the standard model using the d / h and @xmath0  abundance ratios set by bbn . in section  [ sec :",
    "bbniso ] , i derive the dependence of these ratios on @xmath12  and @xmath1 , and summarize the current best observational determinations . in section  [ sec :",
    "future ] , i discuss the importance of obtaining new experimental values of several important reaction cross sections .",
    "i also discuss the future potential of measuring the he isotope ratio in near - primordial environments , before highlighting the main conclusions of this work in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    ".h isotope ratio coefficients [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : hecoeff ]    the helium isotope ratio ( @xmath0 ) , on the other hand , has received relatively little attention from both the theoretical and observational bbn community .",
    "the current best estimate of the he isotope ratio is measured from the so - called ` quintessence ' phase ( he - q ) from solar system meteorite samples @xcite .",
    "the isotope ratios of the noble gases that are incorporated into ` phase q ' are believed to represent the values that preceded the formation of the solar system , when the universe was less than 67 per cent of its current age ( i.e. less than @xmath22  billion years after the big bang ) .",
    "although he - q may not represent the primordial @xmath0  ( see section  [ sec : pristine ] ) , this estimate provides an illustrative value that can be used in the present work .     +    extracting the noble gases contained in phase q requires a two stage process @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "a meteorite is exposed to hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid ( i.e. demineralization ) , which leaves a resistant carbonaceous residue .",
    "this residue is subsequently exposed to nitric acid , which oxidizes the ( presently unknown ) carrier ` q ' , thereby releasing the noble gases , including both he isotopes .",
    "the ideal meteorites for determining the phase q isotopic abundances are those that have the lowest cosmic ray exposure age , since the isotope ratio will be less affected by cosmogenic he production .",
    "the best current determination of the he - q isotope ratio comes from the isna meteorite @xcite , which has a remarkably short cosmic ray exposure age , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the isna he - q isotope ratio is @xmath24 .",
    "the bbn contours for the above observations and calculations are presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] .",
    "this figure highlights some of the benefits of using the he isotope ratio to test the standard model ; the d / h and @xmath0  abundance ratios offer almost orthogonal bounds on @xmath12  and @xmath1 .",
    "the determination of @xmath1  therefore depends almost equally on d / h and @xmath0 , unlike the combination of d / h+y@xmath11 , where y@xmath11  drives the determination of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , d / h , y@xmath11 , and @xmath0  all exhibiting a very different dependence on @xmath12  and @xmath1 , and their combined measurement will provide a highly complementary approach to identify physics beyond the standard model .",
    "assuming that the pre - solar @xmath0  ratio reflects the primordial value , and adopting a conservative uncertainty in the bbn calculations ( @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) , the following limits are placed on the baryon density and the effective number of neutrino species : @xmath12(bbn )  @xmath29 and @xmath1(bbn )  @xmath30 ( 95 per cent confidence limits ) .",
    "these results agree remarkably well with the standard model of cosmology and particle physics , and the _ planck _ cmb analysis ( gray contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] ) .",
    "by improving a few key bbn nuclear reaction rates ( discussed further below ) , significantly tighter bounds on @xmath12(bbn ) and @xmath1(bbn ) will be possible using observational measures of comparable precision .",
    "for example , assuming the same central values for the bbn reaction rates , a 1 per cent standard error in these rates would reduce the uncertainty on @xmath1(bbn ) by a factor of 2 . the bbn contours for this level of uncertainty in the reaction rates",
    "are illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] , and are competitive with that of the _ planck _ cmb experiment .    in order for this level of precision",
    "to be realized , several bbn reaction rates must be revisited and measured using modern facilities .",
    "the three most uncertain reaction rates that determine the d / h abundance are d(p,@xmath31he , d(d , n)@xmath3he , and d(d , p)@xmath3h @xcite . for the he isotope ratio ,",
    "the most important reactions are d(p,@xmath31he and @xmath3he(d , p)@xmath10he .",
    "new experimental data for the crucial d(p,@xmath31he reaction , which contributes the dominant uncertainty for both the d / h and @xmath0  abundance ratios , are currently being acquired by the laboratory for underground nuclear astrophysics ( luna ; @xcite ) .",
    "new data for the remaining reaction rates are now needed .",
    "+    the isna he - q measurement currently provides our best indication of the primordial he isotope ratio .",
    "however , it remains unclear if he - q is a true reflection of the primordial bbn value .",
    "a measurement of the he isotope ratio in a near - pristine environment , where the post - bbn chemical evolution of @xmath3he is expected to be negligible , will provide a more reliable determination of the truly primordial @xmath3he/@xmath10he ratio . in principle",
    ", such a measurement should be possible in known metal - poor ii  regions by comparing the profiles of two iemission lines , since the isotope shift is different for all i  transitions ( a relative shift of up to @xmath32 for the optical and near - infrared emission lines ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath3he @xmath33 singlet transition ( i@xmath34 ) has an isotope shift of @xmath35 , and the @xmath3he @xmath36 triplet transition ( i@xmath37 ) has an isotope shift of @xmath38 .",
    "the above combination of emission lines is perhaps the best suited to obtain a direct measurement of the @xmath3i  flux from a metal - poor ii  region . assuming a flux ratio of @xmath39",
    ", the centroid of the @xmath3i  line would need to be ideally @xmath40 from the centroid of the @xmath10i  line to ensure that the @xmath3i  emission dominates the signal .",
    "for the @xmath41 m i  line , this @xmath40 shift corresponds to a @xmath10i  profile with a full width at half maximum , fwhm  @xmath42 . for",
    "comparison , thermal broadening of the @xmath10he line at a temperature of 15,000  k , which is typical of ii  regions @xcite , would produce a profile with fwhm  @xmath43 .    to detect the @xmath3i  feature at @xmath44 confidence , the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the @xmath10i  feature must exceed @xmath45 , or s / n  @xmath46 .",
    "this s / n requirement would need to be increased if the stellar continuum of the target galaxy is bright , or if the red wing of the @xmath4i  emission line extends over the @xmath5i  emission line . in any case , the primary requirement is that the @xmath4i  profile is smooth and narrow . to confirm that an observed feature is due to @xmath3iemission , and not a coincident weak @xmath10i  emission feature , another i  emission line with a different isotope shift ( e.g. i@xmath34 ) can be inspected .",
    "an example comparison of two i  emission lines is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] for a gaussian profile with fwhm  @xmath47 .    measuring the @xmath3i  flux from a nearby metal - poor ii  region might be possible with the next generation of 30+m telescopes .",
    "the current instrument concepts of the hires and hros echelle spectrographs , to be mounted on the european extremely large telescope and the thirty meter telescope respectively , are well - designed for this experiment .",
    "the wavelength range covered by these instrument concepts includes the best available iemission lines with a single instrument setup .",
    "moreover , the large telescope aperture greatly facilitates the final s / n that can be achieved .",
    "however , to realize this measurement , emphasis should now be placed on discovering suitable low metallicity ii  regions with quiescent kinematics .",
    "the primordial abundance of helium-3 ( @xmath3he / h ) , is generally considered to provide very little constraining power on the physics of bbn , since it is less sensitive to the baryon density than the primordial deuterium abundance , is less affected by the expansion rate than the @xmath10he mass fraction , and a reliable estimate of the primordial value has not been measured .",
    "this paper highlights the possibility of combining the deuterium abundance and the helium isotope ratio ( @xmath0 ) to simultaneously estimate @xmath12  and @xmath1  at the time of bbn .",
    "the following conclusions are drawn : +  ( i ) the d / h and @xmath0  isotope ratios set by bbn offer almost orthogonal bounds on @xmath12  and @xmath1 , unlike y@xmath11 which is essentially independent of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , by combining d / h and @xmath0 , evidence for physics beyond the standard model is less influenced by a single measurement .",
    "( ii ) if the pre - solar meteoritic value of @xmath0  reflects the primordial value , the following bounds can be placed on the baryon density , @xmath12(bbn )  @xmath48 , and the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath1(bbn )  @xmath2 with 95 per cent confidence , assuming a conservative uncertainty for the measured bbn reaction rates ( @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) .",
    "( iii ) in order to achieve bounds on @xmath12  and @xmath1  that are competitive with the latest results from the _ planck _ satellite , several important bbn reaction rates must be redetermined , including d(p,@xmath31he , d(d , n)@xmath3he , d(d , p)@xmath3h , and @xmath3he(d , p)@xmath10he .",
    "( iv ) it is presently unclear to what degree the he - q isotope ratio is affected by post - bbn nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is therefore necessary to obtain a measurement of the he isotope ratio in a near - pristine environment .",
    "nearby metal - poor ii  regions could be the most promising systems to estimate the primordial @xmath3he/@xmath10he ratio .",
    "the i  optical and near - infrared emission lines typically seen in ii  regions exhibit a variety of isotope shifts ( up to @xmath4940  km  s@xmath50 ) , allowing the @xmath3he emission to be unambiguously identified . with a view to this goal , i present a possible strategy to measure the @xmath3i  flux from nearby metal - poor ii  regions .",
    "although such a delicate measurement will have to wait for the next generation of @xmath51 m telescope facilities , it is critical that the relevant bbn reaction rates are now measured with high precision .",
    "once this goal is achieved , the combined information provided by the primordial d / h abundance and the @xmath0  isotope ratio has the potential to deliver a reliable probe of possible departures from the standard model of physics during the early universe .",
