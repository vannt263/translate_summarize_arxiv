    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to motivate additional experimental investigations by providing estimates , based upon vmd , of tensor glueball photoproduction observables and also to detail a possible decay signature for hadronic states with a significant gluonic component . </S>",
    "<S> the latter entails comparable @xmath7 hadronic widths , with the largest branch to @xmath8 that promptly goes to @xmath9 , and somewhat suppressed @xmath4 and @xmath5 radiative decays relative to @xmath10 . as discussed below , this decay signature is not expected for hadrons with a predominantly quark structure . </S>",
    "<S> these results are essentially model - independent since they follow directly from the general principles of vmd , which has been found to agree with more fundamental qcd based meson radiative calculations  @xcite , and the flavor independence of quark - gluonic couplings .    consider the radiative decay @xmath11 of a neutral tensor hadron with arbitrary quark , gluon structure and mass @xmath12 . here </S>",

    "<S> consistency requires the same relative sign between the couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 since the latter , like the @xmath2 decay constant , is linear in the @xmath2 phase . because @xmath57 and @xmath58 are comparable in magnitude , @xmath59 is very sensitive to this relative phase and would be dramatically lower , .0064 , if indeed the net phase was negative . </S>",
