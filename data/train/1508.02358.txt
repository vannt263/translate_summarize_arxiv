    "with 450 papers that include the words `` fundamental plane '' in their titles , our purpose is less to say something new than to reassemble some of what has been said before and frame it in a way that renders the fundamental plane somewhat less mysterious .",
    "if one measures stellar velocity dispersions , @xmath0 , effective radii , @xmath1 , and effective surface brightnesses , as measured in some filter , @xmath2 , for elliptical galaxies , the observations lie close to a plane when plotted in the space spanned by @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) ) . fitting a plane to the data yields three coefficients , as shown in equation  [ fund ] .",
    "the effective radius and surface brightness may be combined to produce a luminosity @xmath6 .",
    "the ellipticals lie along a corresponding plane in the space spanned by @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "if one has observations in several filters , one can calculate stellar masses , @xmath8 , subject to considerable uncertainty in the initial mass function and its trend with velocity dispersion , and stellar surface densities , @xmath9 .",
    "these also have associated planes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( hyde and bernardi 2009 ) ) . for the present discussion",
    "we consider the fundamental plane in the space spanned by @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11    two of these quantities , the effective radius and the stellar mass , describe a manifestly baryonic component of elliptical galaxies  the stars .",
    "we argue here that the third quantity , the stellar velocity dispersion , is a proxy for the velocity dispersion in the galaxy s dark matter halo .",
    "astronomers almost always use the virial theorem in the form appropriate to the global properties of equilibrium systems , @xmath12 by contrast , physics texts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. goldstein 1980 ) ) often present the virial theorem in a form appropriate to the orbit of a single star , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the twice the orbit averaged kinetic energy per unit mass , @xmath15 is the gradient of the gravitational potential and @xmath16 is position .",
    "the orbit averaged kinetic energies for stars and dark matter particles , are respectively , @xmath17 @xmath18 the stellar and dark matter velocity dispersions are the product of the _ same _ gravitational potential and differ _ only _ insofar as the quantity @xmath19 varies with radius .",
    "but there are several lines of evidence that point to little or no variation of @xmath19 with radius .",
    "it was the observation that spiral galaxies have circular velocities in excess of what was expected from their observable baryons that first lead to the conclusion that they were embedded in dark matter halos .",
    "but beyond that , h i rotation curves are remarkably flat , leading ( * ? ? ? * van albada and sancisi ( 1986 ) ) to conclude that there was a `` disk - halo conspiracy . ''",
    "the baryons dissipate to the point where they just compensate for what would otherwise be a decline in the rotation curve in the absence of baryons .",
    "* gavazzi et al ( 2007 ) ) subsequently used a combination of strong and weak lensing to show that there is likewise a `` spheroid - halo conspiracy '' for early - type systems .",
    "the gravitational potentials are isothermal giving @xmath20 constant .",
    "* humphrey and buote ( 2010 ) ) use x - ray observations and likewise find a conspiracy producing isothermal potentials .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions are therefore telling us the velocity dispersion of the dark matter .",
    "we have marked up the fundamental plane equation  [ fund ] to show that while the effective radius and stellar mass are telling us about the baryons , the stellar velocity dispersion is telling us the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo , @xmath21 .",
    "dark matter halos are often characterized by their virial radii , @xmath22 and the mass within that radius , @xmath23 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether these , along with @xmath21 , likewise organize themselves into a plane .",
    "they do not .",
    "instead they lie along a tight line .",
    "they are governed by a single parameter , an overall scale .",
    "parameterizing the line by the maximum observed circular velocity , one has @xmath24 the first of these is a consequence of defining halos in terms of densities while the second is consequence of the ongoing nature of virialization and the measurement of the virial radius at the same time for all halos .",
    "now if a stellar velocity dispersion tells us the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo , and if that in turn tells us the mass and radius of the dark matter halo , then we can scale the stellar mass by the mass in dark matter ( or alternatively , the total mass ) , and we can likewise scale the effective radius by the dark matter radius ,",
    "this gives us new axes for the fundamental plane , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "one axis gives us the overall scale of the system , and a second axis tells us what fraction of the the baryons that have been incorporated into stars , on the assumption that the system started out with the cosmological baryon fraction .",
    "while the above argument invokes the spheroid - halo conspiracy in its strongest form , with @xmath25 , the argument can still be made as long as there is a well defined relation between stellar velocity dispersion and halo dispersion .",
    "the stellar components of elliptical galaxies are clearly not as simple as the halos .",
    "while the baryons and dark matter were once nearly uniformly distributed , some baryons dissipated and formed stars at the centers of the halos .",
    "the @xmath26 axis tells the fraction of stars that did so .",
    "the @xmath27 axis is governed both by the dissipation prior to star formation and by the subsequent remixing of stars by mergers .",
    "if these three processes  dissipation , star formation and remixing  were strictly governed by the scale of the halo , the ellipticals would lie along a line .",
    "if there were a stochastic component to each of them , the scatter would thicken the line into a sausage .",
    "the fact that the ellipticals are confined to a plane indicates that the three processes are coupled .",
    "* zaritsky et al ( 2008 ) ) anticipated our representation of the fundamental plane .",
    "they defined an `` efficiency '' , @xmath28 , which differs from our choice of coordinate by a factor of the cosmic baryon fraction . and they defined a `` concentration '' , @xmath29 , which is just the inverse of our coordinate .",
    "they plot both , separately , against stellar velocity dispersion , but do not examine the three dimensional distribution and do not argue that the planarity of the elliptical distribution indicates coupling .",
    "but it is clear from their discussion that a coupling is both possible and likely .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the gravitational potential inside the effective radius , and hence the velocity dispersion , is dominated by stars rather than dark matter ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* treu & koopmans , 2004 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mediavilla et al , 2009 ) ) .",
    "measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion beyond the effective radius might therefore reflect the halo dispersion yet more closely than the central measurements that are typically used .",
    "* schechter et al ( 2014 ) ) found that if one used einstein ring radii to calculate equivalent velocity dispersions for the slacs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( auger et al 2010 ) ) sample , the resulting fundamental plane is substantially tighter than the one constructed using measured stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "it was this result that led to the present formulation , so it can not count as confirmation .",
    "along the same line , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* falcn - barosso and van de ven ( 2011 ) ) find that the they get a tighter fundamental plane when they use velocity dispersions measured out to @xmath1 than the one they get using dispersions interior to @xmath30 .",
    "more extensive samples , and samples extending out to yet larger radii , are on the horizon ."
