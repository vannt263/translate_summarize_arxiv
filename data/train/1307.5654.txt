    "using dispersion theory , the connection between the radiative decays @xmath0 and @xmath7 and the isovector contributions of the form factors @xmath8 and @xmath9 is exploited in a model - independent way .",
    "this is possible , because the amplitude of the former decays can be parametrized in terms of the pion vector form factor , @xmath10 , and a low - order polynomial  @xcite , since @xmath10 as well as the radiative decay amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 share , at least in the low - energy regime , the same right - hand cut .",

    "as a test of internal consistency , we evaluated the analogous sum rule to eq .",

    "in fact , if the integral occurring in the @xmath4 analog of eq.([check_isovec ] ) , namely in the isovector part of the sum rule , is again truncated at @xmath194 , the right - hand side of the total @xmath245 sum rule , @xmath249 which also contains the model - dependent isoscalar term , underestimates the left - hand one by @xmath250 .",
    "if the upper integration range is varied as in the analogous expression for the @xmath2 , then these numbers change to @xmath251 .",
    "in summary , we have derived a model - independent integral representation for the isovector contribution to the @xmath1 transition form factor at low energies and especially the corresponding slope parameter @xmath143 .",
    "the necessary input was taken directly from experimental data , namely from the pion vector form factor , the tabulated branching ratios for the @xmath187 and @xmath252 decays , and from the measured spectral shape of the latter process , parametrized by just one coefficient , the slope parameter @xmath26 as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and eq .",
    "( [ alphadef ] ) .",
    "this was possible with the help of the machinery of dispersion theory , by utilizing the fact that the pion vector form factor and the @xmath0 ( and @xmath7 ) decay amplitudes have the same right - hand cut  at least in the region below @xmath194 for the invariant pion mass square , the region dominating the _ once_-subtracted dispersion relation .",
    "as a consistency check we demonstrated that a related _ un_-subtracted dispersion integral is saturated at 1 gev@xmath76 .    the isoscalar contribution of the slope parameter @xmath143 , modelled by a simple vector - meson - dominance approximation , turned out to be smaller than the uncertainty of the calculation for the isovector part in the @xmath2 case .",
    "in the @xmath4 scenario , the isoscalar part was larger , but still of subleading nature .",
    "in addition , the isoscalar contributions when added to the isovector ones helped in saturating the _ un_-subtracted @xmath41 and @xmath253 sum rules below @xmath194 to an uncertainty better than @xmath254 and @xmath255 , respectively .",
    "our final results for the slopes of the @xmath2 transition form factor are @xmath256 for the isovector contribution and @xmath3 in total .",
    "in fact , the slope at the origin of the transition form factor following the lower edge of the ( orange ) band in figure  [ fig : formfactor ] corresponds to our prediction for the lower bound on the slope parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath257 .",
    "this value is compatible with all recent experimental results , but bigger than most previous theoretical studies known to us .",
    "the available data for the @xmath12 spectral shape are not good enough to allow for a compatible fit of the corresponding @xmath26 parameter . however , the slope parameter @xmath26 solely determined from the high - precision @xmath77 data of ref .",
    "@xcite also provided a good fit to the available @xmath241 spectral data  without any readjustment .",
    "therefore , we conjectured that the value of @xmath26 determined in @xmath11 also applies to @xmath12 .    under this assumption and the inclusion of the model - dependent but subleading isoscalar contributions , which were derived in the same way as for the @xmath2 ,",
    "the following results apply for the slope parameter @xmath145 : the isovector contribution reads @xmath258 while the total result is @xmath259 .",
    "our result for @xmath145 is compatible with all known experimental data , which , however , are rather old , and  this time  also with chiral perturbation theory truncated at 1-loop order and with vmd .    in case of the @xmath2 slope parameter there seems to be some tension between the values determined from experimental data and the ones calculated by the dispersion integral .",
    "however , in this context it should be stressed that the empirical slopes have been extracted from experimental data usually with the help of monopole fits .",
    "those have typically a larger curvature than our main result_cf . _ ( orange ) band in figure  [ fig : formfactor ] .",
    "thus , when the slope at @xmath36 is extracted from a monopole fit of the data , say well above the @xmath260 threshold , the results are characteristically smaller than those derived from the functional form of our final result .",
    "the formalism presented here allows us to disentangle the effects on the form factor slope emerging from the @xmath19-interaction , which are universal , from those of the production vertex , which are reaction specific .",
    "our results show that the production vertex itself , whose effect is encoded in the parameter @xmath26 , contributes to about 20% of the slope of the transition form factor , while the bulk is provided by the @xmath19 intermediate state , which might be viewed as coming from the pole of @xmath65-meson . therefore ,",
    "parametrizing the transition form factor as a single monopole term , which suggests that the mass scale relevant for @xmath1 is entirely controlled by a single , reaction - dependent scale , is misleading , since the actual shape of the form factor emerges from the interplay of two scales .",
    "we would like to thank martin hoferichter , bastian kubis , franz niecknig , stefan leupold and simon eidelman for helpful discussions and advice .",
    "we are grateful to camilla di donato for providing the kloe data and to marc unverzagt for help in connection with figure  [ fig : formfactor ] .",
    "this work is supported in part by the dfg and the nsfc through funds provided to the sino - german crc  110 `` symmetries and the emergence of structure in qcd '' , and by the european community - research infrastructure integrating activity `` study of strongly interacting matter '' ( acronym hadronphysics3 ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : slope ] ) with what can be derived from a simple realization of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) . for this purpose , we may write @xmath261 to proceed we use @xmath262 to approximate the form factor square with the help of the substitution @xmath263 as follows : @xmath264    inserting ( [ eq : pvmd ] ) , ( [ eq : kvmd ] ) and ( [ eq : fvvmdsquared ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : slope ] ) yields @xmath265 we may now employ the explicit form of the width of @xmath65 , @xmath266 namely the ( spin - averaged ) standard two - body decay formula  @xcite with @xmath267 as amplitude and @xmath268 as coupling constant . in this way we get",
    "@xmath269 where in the last step the ksfr relation @xmath270 was applied  @xcite .",
    "thus our formalism naturally matches onto the vmd approximation  see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and @xcite for recent updates  once the corresponding expressions for the various ingredients are imposed . if we had kept the empirical value @xmath271 and inserted the linear polynomial @xmath272 instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pvmd ] ) into the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_approx ] ) , we would have got the modified approximation @xmath273 for the isovector part of the slope . in this case",
    "the vmd result would be enlarged by a factor @xmath274 , namely by the linear polynomial @xmath275 evaluated at @xmath276 with @xmath26 as in eq .",
    "( [ alphaval ] ) , while the empirical prefactor @xmath115 would nearly counterbalance this result , such that approximately the original vmd result , @xmath277 reemerges .",
