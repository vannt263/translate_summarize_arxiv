    "diffractive processes such as @xmath67 have been studied extensively in deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering ( dis ) at the hera collider  @xcite , and provide an essential input for the understanding of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high parton densities .",
    "the photon virtuality @xmath68 supplies a hard scale , which allows the application of perturbative qcd .",
    "diffractive dis events can be viewed as resulting from processes in which the photon probes a net colour singlet combination of exchanged partons .",
    "a hard scattering qcd collinear factorisation theorem @xcite allows the definition of ` diffractive parton distribution functions ' ( dpdfs ) for a given scattered proton four - momentum .",
    "the dependence of diffractive dis on @xmath6 , the bjorken scaling variable , and @xmath68 can thus be treated in a manner similar to inclusive dis , e.g. through the application of the dglap parton evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "within regge phenomenology , diffractive cross sections are described by the exchange of a pomeron ( @xmath69 ) trajectory , as illustrated in figure  [ reggefac ] . in previous measurements at hera  @xcite diffractive dis cross sections are interpreted in a combined framework , which applies the qcd factorisation theorem to the @xmath6 and @xmath68 dependence and uses a regge inspired approach to express the dependence on @xmath8 , the fraction of the incident proton longitudinal momentum carried by the colour singlet exchange . in this framework the data at low @xmath8 are well described and dpdfs and a pomeron trajectory intercept are extracted . in order to describe the data at larger @xmath8 , it is necessary to include a sub - leading exchange trajectory ( @xmath70 ) , with an intercept which is consistent with the approximately degenerate trajectories associated with the exchange of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 mesons .",
    "( 100,60 ) ( 25,-6 )    in many previous analyses diffractive dis events are selected on the basis of the presence of a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) between the leading proton and the remainder of the hadronic final state @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the lrg method is high acceptance for diffractive processes .",
    "a complementary way to study diffractive processes is by direct measurement of the outgoing proton .",
    "this is achieved in h1 using the forward proton spectrometer ( fps )  @xcite .",
    "although the fps detector has low acceptance , the fps method of studying diffraction has several advantages .",
    "in contrast to the lrg case , the squared four - momentum transfer @xmath7 at the proton vertex can be reconstructed .",
    "the fps method selects events in which the proton scatters elastically , whereas the lrg method does not distinguish between the case where the scattered proton remains intact or where it dissociates into a system of low mass @xmath76 .",
    "the fps method also allows measurements up to higher values of @xmath8 than is possible with the lrg method , extending into regions where the sub - leading trajectory is the dominant exchange .",
    "the fps and lrg methods provide means to investigate whether the hard scattering process characterised by the variables @xmath77 and @xmath68 depends also on the variables @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath76 associated with the proton vertex . according to the proton vertex factorisation hypothesis , the cross section can be written as the product of two factors , one characterising the hard interaction depending on @xmath78 and @xmath68 , the other characterising the proton vertex depending on @xmath8 and @xmath7 .    in this paper ,",
