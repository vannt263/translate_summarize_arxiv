    "in many physical contexts e.g. the switching of magnetic domain walls ( barkhausen noise ) or the motion of twin boundaries in crystals , one observes an intermittent dynamics of energy relaxation with `` relaxation events '' of random amplitude .",
    "this type of dynamics is commonly called avalanche dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in order to give a possible explanation for this kind of mechanism , we need three ingredients : a rough interaction potential with many local energy barriers , and a small tilt ; an `` almost hamiltonian '' dynamics that approximately conserves the total energy , helping the system to overcome the next energy barrier once it passes the first one ; finally a weak coupling to a heat bath .",
    "the simplest model one may consider in a two dimensional phase space taking into account all these factors is the brownian motion in a tilted periodic potential .",
    "let @xmath2 be the coordinate of a one - dimensional brownian particle moving in a periodic oscillating potential @xmath3 ( e. g. @xmath4 ) in the presence of viscosity @xmath0 and subject to an additional constant external force @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics for @xmath5 is governed by the langevin equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the white noise , and @xmath8 a small parameter .",
    "the model is not new , indeed it has been widely studied because of its well known applications to several classical areas of physics such as electronics ( see e.g. @xcite ) and solid state physics ( superionic conductors and josephson tunneling junction , see e.g. section 11.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "according to the values of the parameters and the initial conditions , the particle may escape in the direction of the force @xmath1 or be trapped for a long time in one of the wells of the potential . without any noise ( @xmath9 ) , when @xmath1 is large enough there are only `` running solutions '' , i.e. unbounded solutions . when the force @xmath1 is small enough and",
    "the friction parameter @xmath0 is large enough , the particle finally reaches one of the minima of the potential . in this case",
    "there are only `` locked solutions '' . for @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "small enough , both types of solution coexist . with the addition of the noise",
    "there are certainly transitions between the locked and the running state , due to large deviations effects and related to the problem of diffusion exit from a domain @xcite .",
    "these kind of transitions take place in the kramer s escape time scale , i.e. the time required for a brownian particle to escape from a well in the presence of viscosity , that is of order of @xmath10 for @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a wide literature concerning the diffusion along a periodic potential , mostly inspired by the kramer s theory @xcite , that includes both numerical and theoretical studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we do not assume a large deviations point of view , since we are interested in a different time scale .",
    "in certain critical regimes , due to the instability of the dynamics , small stochastic perturbations may indeed affect the macroscopic behavior even in a faster time scale .",
    "this for instance turns out to be the case for the particular choice @xmath12 yielding heteroclinic deterministic orbits ( i.e. orbits connecting two consecutive maxima of the potential ) . in the present work",
    "we show that , by stochastically perturbing the system in the critical regime @xmath13 that exibits both running and locked solutions , only the locked solutions survive in a subexponential time scale ( and more precisely if one observes the system for times @xmath14 ) .",
    "the introduction of an arbitrarly small noise has thus a macroscopic effect , since it reduces the bistability region even in this `` fast time scale '' .",
    "the next case to consider is thus the region @xmath15 . in particular",
    "one may wonder whether there exists a transition regime from the fast to the slow time scale where only the kramer s diffusion is observed .",
    ".5 cm      we denote by @xmath16 the total potential taking into account also the linear term due to the external force , @xmath17 .",
    "the equation of the motion then becomes @xmath18 and the related first order system is @xmath19    consider the deterministic system related to , i.e. the @xmath20 case , @xmath21 and sketch the phase diagram . in each period of the original potential @xmath3 there are confined and escaping orbits .",
    "the picture changes according to @xmath1 and @xmath22 .    in absence of viscosity and external force ( i.e. for @xmath23 ) , the orbits are periodic ( see figure [ periodico ] ) .    for positive @xmath22 and @xmath1",
    "the dynamics loses its periodicity .",
    "the inclusion of the friction makes the system dissipative , the particles lose energy , and the confined orbits are attracted by the local minima of the potential , whereas the running solutions have an asymptotic effective velocity .",
    "figures [ phase2 ] , [ phase ] and [ phase1 ] provide three possible phase diagrams .",
    "for @xmath24 the total potential @xmath16 does not have local minima and then there are only running solutions ( see figure [ phase2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath25 , there are also bounded solutions . for any @xmath26 , there exists a critical value @xmath27 such that , for @xmath28 , there are only confined orbits ( see figure [ phase ] )",
    ". for @xmath29 running and bounded orbits coexist ( see figure [ phase1 ] ) .",
    "the situation is well resumed in figure [ alpha ] that shows the dependence on @xmath0 of the critical value @xmath30 . as we will see below",
    ", @xmath31 is of the order of @xmath22 as @xmath32 .",
    "for any @xmath33 there exist critical orbits , i.e. orbits asymptotically converging to some saddle equilibria ( corresponding to some local maxima of the potential ) in the phase plane .",
    "the critical scaling @xmath13 is the one that gives rise to heteroclinic orbits , i.e. orbits connecting two consecutive local maxima of the potential .",
    "each orbit can be piecewise expressed by a function in the phase plane that we will usually denote by @xmath34 .",
    "we say that @xmath34 is an orbit of our dynamics if there exists a solution @xmath35 of and a suitable time interval @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for any @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath34 must verify the @xmath39      in the present paper we are interested in the critical regime ( @xmath13 ) dynamics in the small noise limit ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "thus from now on we fix @xmath0 small enough and @xmath13 .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the @xmath42-th heteroclinic orbit , i.e. the orbit connecting the @xmath43-th maximum of the potential with the @xmath42-th one : @xmath44 see figure [ hete2 ] .    in this paper",
    "we are not concerned with large deviations .",
    "we investigate the problem in a sub - exponential time scale .",
    "far from the critical orbits we expect that the noise does not macroscopically affect the deterministic dynamics in such a fast time scale . on the other hand , there may be a macroscopic perturbation of the deterministic dynamics in a neighbourhood of the heteroclinic orbits .",
    "then we choose the initial value to lay on one of the heteroclinic orbits , i.e. we denote by @xmath45 the solution of the problem @xmath46 and study the probability law of @xmath45 in the limit as @xmath40 .    we show that , at each time , the probability for the particle , to get across the next well is @xmath47 , in the limit as @xmath40 .",
    "we prove , thus , that for fixed @xmath0 small enough , the random variable associated to the number of wells passed by @xmath48 has , for vanishing @xmath49 , a geometric distribution of parameter @xmath47 .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the particle will finally be trapped in one of the wells for a long time , with probability 1 as @xmath40 .",
    "the involved time scale , or more precisely , the velocity the particle travels before to be trapped in one of the wells is of order @xmath50 . with the inclusion of the noise ,",
    "thus , the bistability between the locked and the running states is lost and only the locked state survives in this `` fast time scale '' .      before turning to the precise statement ,",
    "we introduce some notations . we shall use    * @xmath51 as @xmath52 if @xmath53 ; * @xmath54 as @xmath52 if there exists @xmath55 such that @xmath56 for any sufficiently small @xmath57 ; * @xmath58 as @xmath52 if there exist @xmath59 such that @xmath60 for any sufficiently small @xmath57 ; * @xmath61 if the stochastic variable has probability law @xmath62 .",
    "although our results do not depend on the exact form of the potential , for the sake of simplicity we choose @xmath63 in such a way that @xmath16 attains its local maxima at @xmath64 and its local minima at @xmath65 .",
    "let us investigate how @xmath30 is related to @xmath0 .",
    "all the orbits @xmath66 must verify the equation , then @xmath67    .3 cm    by integrating in @xmath68 , and using the asympthotic conditions we get @xmath69 thus @xmath70 in the limit as @xmath71 .",
    ".3 cm    we compute the asymptotic values of @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 then , from we obtain that the asympthotic slopes of the heteroclinic orbits : @xmath75 must satisfy the equation @xmath76 then @xmath77 notice that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we define , moreover , the parameter @xmath80 then @xmath81 as @xmath71 with @xmath82 .      in a neighborhood of the criticalities , i.e. when @xmath5 approaches @xmath83 , @xmath84",
    "is well approximated by @xmath85 , since @xmath86 .",
    "hence the dynamics can be approximated by the linear system @xmath87    a convenient choice of variables is given by @xmath88    with @xmath89 as defined in . since in these variables",
    "the linearized system becomes @xmath90 where the equations are coupled only per the stochastic term .",
    ".3 cm    since @xmath91 , by , for @xmath92 small enough we have @xmath93 and @xmath94    the variable @xmath95 can , thus , be thought of as a measure of the distance , in the phase plane , from the @xmath42-th heteroclinic orbit @xmath96 just before the @xmath42-th criticality .",
    "equivalently @xmath97 is a measure of the distance from the @xmath98-th heteroclinic orbit @xmath99 just after the @xmath42-th criticality .      far from criticalities",
    "the dynamics is stable and we expect the distribution of our process to be quite concentred in a neighborhood of some deterministic paths ( see the deterministic system ) .",
    "one of the main technicalities we run into in the proof of our result is the choice of the length of the critical interval .",
    "it is clear that the linear system is a good approximation of our dynamics as long as @xmath5 is close enough to the @xmath42-th criticality @xmath83 .",
    "this provides an upper bound on the critical interval length . on the other hand , we need a good localization of the process at the beginning of the critical interval .",
    "we want the process to be still quite concetrated and not to diffuse too much .",
    "this clearly requires a lower bound on the length of the critical interval .",
    "we denote by @xmath100 the order of magnitude of the length of the critical interval .",
    "then , in order to make valid our approximations we need to impose the following condition on @xmath100 : @xmath101 and @xmath102 as in .    .2 cm    we define two sequences of stopping times .",
