    "they are integrated in positive and negative time direction .    for the case @xmath36 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch_nonlin](a ) the norm and therefore the radius are conserved quantities .",

    "this behavior changes drastically if a small gain / loss parameter @xmath125 is introduced as done in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch_nonlin](b ) .",
    "due to the gain and loss , the norm of the wave packets are no longer conserved and the trajectories no longer run on the surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "we identify two different regions on the great circle for initial wave packets which are delimited by the ground state , viz .  the north pole , and the excited state .",
    "all wave packet starting in the region on the front side between the two fixed points ( thick blue lines ) evolve to a smaller norm inside the bloch sphere whereas wave packets starting on the second region on the back side ( red lines ) evolve to a higher norm outside the sphere .",
    "the two @xmath0-symmetric stationary states are again elliptic fixed points , thus being stable .",
    "the sum of all oscillating trajectories of the wave packets define closed surfaces which can not be penetrated by other trajectories .",
    "increasing the gain / loss parameter to @xmath126 leads to the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch_nonlin](c ) .",
    "again the wave packets starting on the front region between the two fixed points oscillate to a smaller norm and define a closed surface inside the bloch sphere .",
    "however , the wave packets starting on the back region and oscillating outside the bloch sphere do no longer define a closed surface . instead an additional type of trajectories with diverging norm encircling the @xmath0-broken eigenstates appears . for @xmath39",
    "the amount of diverging trajectories increases as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch_nonlin](d ) .",
    "these trajectories arrive from the vicinity of the @xmath0-broken state with @xmath121 on the right side , touch the sphere , and leave the region of the sphere to larger radii @xmath107 encircling the path of the @xmath0-broken state with @xmath120 on the left side .",
    "this illustrates the role of the @xmath0-broken solutions for the dynamics of the condensate as sink and source .",
    "another qualitative change in the dynamical behavior is found for @xmath77 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch_nonlin](e ) . in agreement with the investigation of the linear stability in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability_pt ] the ground state is unstable for @xmath117 , viz .  exactly on the surface of the bloch sphere . for lower values of @xmath17",
    "there is a region around the ground state in which only stable oscillations originate .",
    "for @xmath77 the ground state is unstable and all wave packets starting on the @xmath106 meridian behind the ground state are diverging .",
    "wave packets starting before the ground state still show stable oscillations evolving inside the sphere .    finally for @xmath73 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch_nonlin](f ) the two @xmath0-symmetric stationary solutions are almost identical and most wave packets starting on the great circle on the bloch sphere diverge .",
    "only wave packets starting in a small region around the stable excited state and in the region between the two stationary states still show stable oscillations . for even greater values of @xmath17",
    "the stationary solutions do no longer exist on the surface of the bloch sphere and no stable oscillations starting on the great circle can be observed .",
    "we studied the implications of @xmath0 symmetry on the dynamical behavior and stability of a bec with contact interaction in a double - well potential .    solving",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for non - hermitian systems showed that the two @xmath0-symmetric stationary solutions with smallest chemical potential are stable as long as the @xmath0-broken states do not exist .",
    "however , the ground state becomes dynamically unstable in the vicinity of the pitchfork bifurcation at which the @xmath0-broken states emerge from the ground state at an attractive interaction strength .",
    "analogously the excited state becomes unstable at repulsive interactions in the vicinity of the pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "the discrepancy between the bifurcations and the points at which the stability changes could be traced back to the norm dependency of the gross - pitaevskii nonlinearity .    due to the non - hermiticity of the system the dynamics",
    "is not governed by isolated fixed points but an infinite number of eigenstates which solve the time - independent gpe for the varying number of particles .",
    "the dynamics of the condensate was visualized using the bloch sphere formalism although the dynamics is not constrained to the surface of the sphere due to the nonlinearity and non - hermiticity of the system . applying a small gain and loss of particles",
    "leaves the typical dynamics in a real double - well potential mostly intact but the trajectories now run slightly above or below the surface of the sphere describing a condensate with more or less particles , respectively . for stronger gain / loss contributions an additional type of trajectories arises which describes a condensate localized in one well with a diverging number of particles .",
    "these diverging trajectories encircle the @xmath0-broken eigenstates of the time - independent gpe .",
    "however it is still possible to choose initial wave packets that show stable oscillations .",
    "in fact we observed that all @xmath0-symmetric wave functions which initially dive into the sphere always show stable oscillations .",
    "if the gain and loss is further increased most wave packets diverge and stable oscillations are only found in a small region in the vicinity of the excited state .",
    "understanding the dynamics of a bec in a @xmath0-symmetric double well is the first step towards an experimental realization of a @xmath0-symmetric quantum system and the starting point for studies in more complex potentials and with additional interaction types like the dipolar interaction",
    ". additionally it would be highly desirable to obtain a microscopic description of the in- and outcoupling process represented by an imaginary potential in the mean - field limit . analyzing the bifurcation scenario at strong attractive interaction strengths switching from two tangent bifurcations to one in the presence of gain and loss as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_3d ] is an interesting task for future work from a more theoretical point of view and can probably be achieved using the analytic continuation described in  @xcite .",
