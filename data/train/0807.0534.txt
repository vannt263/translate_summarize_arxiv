    "the blazhko modulation of rr lyrae stars , a phenomenon known for about a century , is still one of the open questions in astrophysics .",
    "the problems and the inconsistencies of the existing models with observational facts were recently discussed in details by @xcite , therefore we only briefly mention here that none of the suggested models ( magnetic oblique rotator , @xcite ; resonant excitation of nonradial modes , @xcite ) can explain the complexity of all the observed properties of the modulation .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggests that the modulation may be explained by continuous amplitude and period changes of the pulsation due to the action of a turbulent convective dynamo in the lower envelope of the star , with dynamo cycle identical with the blazhko period .",
    "this explanation does not involve any nonradial mode component , the phenomenon is interpreted in the framework that blazhko rrab stars are purely fundamental mode radial pulsators .",
    "however , @xcite gives only a qualitative , rough picture of his model , that have to be checked both observationally and theoretically , thus the investigation of the phenomenon still remains an important and valid task .    a lot of efforts have been already made in studying the light curve changes of rr lyrae stars but most of the available photometries of blazhko variables have some defects : inaccuracy ( visual , photographic data ) , biased data sampling ( the photoelectric observations focused mostly on the rising branch , maximum phase of the light curve ) , data inhomogeneity due to rare data sampling on a too long timebase ( the time scale of period changes and changes in the modulation properties can be as short as a few years ) , etc .",
    "most of the recent ccd and/or photoelectric observations of individual blazhko stars are not extended enough to study the modulation properties in full detail .",
    "the first multicolour photometric data that covered each phase of both the modulation and the pulsation within a short time - base ( one season ) were published for rr gem @xcite . during the period of the ccd observations",
    "rr gem showed , however , small amplitude modulation , that limits the available information due to the low s / n ratios of the modulation signals .",
    "we started a systematic search for previously unknown blazhko variables at konkoly observatory in 2004 using the advantage of full access to an automated 60 cm telescope @xcite .",
    "the aim has also been to clear up questionable cases . in @xcite",
    "we have revised the list of known blazhko variables @xcite .",
    "the modulation of mw  lyrae was found to be ambiguous as the photographic observations @xcite did not confirm the modulation detected in visual data by @xcite .",
    "our ccd observations of mw lyrae affirm the light curve modulation of the star , but with a modulation period about half of that @xcite announced .",
    "spectroscopic observation of mw lyr has never been obtained , however , based on its short period ( @xmath8  days ) it should be a relatively hot and metal rich rr lyrae star .    in the 2006 and 2007 seasons we obtained ccd photometric observations of mw  lyrae .",
    "this is the first multicolour photometric data set of a large modulation amplitude blazhko variable that is condensed , extended , and accurate enough to detect previously unknown properties of the modulation .    in this paper",
    "the photometric data of mw lyr are published and analysed . the light curve solution ( frequency analysis )",

    "our extended and accurate data make it possible to find the correct answers to these questions",

    "however , this procedure may yield a mean light curve that is biased by the uneven data sampling , even in the case of an extended data set .",
    "the typical procedure of light curve analysis of blazhko stars is prewhitening first with the pulsation frequency and its harmonics ( with the mean light curve defined above ) , and then , the prewhitened data are analysed to identify the modulation components . as a result of the incorrect shape of the removed mean light curve during this procedure false signals in the vicinity of the pulsation components emerge",

    "this data set , which contains 3900 data points from 120 nights is , however , more dense and extended than any previous photometric observation of a blazhko variable .",
    "though these data cover the whole pulsation light curve in each 0.05 phase of the modulation , the differences between the mean light curves defined by method @xmath57 , and by method @xmath55 are significant .",
    "the fitted mean light curves shown in fig [ f5 ] are :    1 .    the fourier fit to the data with the pulsation frequency and its harmonics ( _ method a _ ) ; 2 .",

    "the pulsation light curve taken from the complete light curve solution of the entire data set ( light curve solution d as given in table  [ big ] ) .",
    "method @xmath57 gives substantially smaller amplitude around minimum and maximum light due to the oversampling of the small amplitude phase of the modulation in the data , than the fits either from method @xmath55 or from the light curve solution d. the latter fits are very similar , showing that with the inclusion of the most prominent modulation components ( triplets ) in the light curve solution quite a reliable mean light curve can be gained even if the data sampling is biased .",
    "the right panels in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] show the residual spectra of the three fits in the vicinity of the pulsation frequency and its first harmonic . in order to make the residuals comparable ,",
    "the modulation side frequencies are also removed in a second step in method @xmath57 .",
    "these residual spectra show high amplitude signals at @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which also points to the inadequacy of prewhitening the data in consequtive steps .",
    "we thus conclude that one has to be cautious how to define the mean light curve of a blazhko variable as from method @xmath57 and method @xmath55 different results emerge . in real observations",

    "the appearance of the @xmath99 , @xmath100 frequency components in the fourier spectrum of the whole data set is probably connected with this double periodic behaviour of the higher order phase differences .",
    "we have also tested how accurately the observations can be fitted with a simple mathematical model which describes the amplitude and phase changes of the different order pulsation components with different order fourier series .",
    "we have found that such a light curve solution fails to fit the observaions with similar accuracy as the fourier sum of the pulsation and modulation side lobe frequencies involving even a smaller number of parameters .",
    "this result means that the modulation has a very complex behaviour that could not be described by a mathematical model of amplitude and phase modulations of harmonic functions .",
    "phenomenologically , amplitude modulation occurs if there are observed changes in the brightnesses of the light curve maxima , while phase modulation manifests itself as a missing fix point on the rising branch of the folded light curve .    exploiting the slight changes in the lower order phase differences",
    ", we can ` harmonize ' the phases of the light curves with a simple phase correction . shifting the fitted light curves of the different bins by their @xmath61 values a surprisingly coherent light curve series emerge as shown in fig .",
    "[ megold ] .",
    "the pronounced fix point occurring on the rising branch in this figure validates our simple treatment separating the phase modulation of the light curve from the amplitude modulation by correcting the phases with the @xmath61 values .",
    "a similar procedure can be applied on the whole data set , as well .",
    "fitting the @xmath61 values of the 20 phase bins with a 2nd order fourier sum we can define a continuous function of the phase variation .",
    "it is supposed that by transforming the times of the observations according to this function we ` get rid of ' the phase modulation component of the modulation . as the right panel in fig .",
    "[ megold ] shows , this is indeed the case , the light curve of the time transformed data shows very regular amplitude modulation with a pronounced fix point on its rising branch .",
    "the phase difference of the amplitude peaks of the time transformed data is much smaller than in the original data .",
    "its range is consistent with the value expected from the amplitude variation .    without starting the light curve analysis from the beginning using this phase corrected data set ,",
    "we have only checked    * whether or not the same frequency components occur in the spectrum of the time transformed data as in the original data set , + and * how the rms scatter of the time transformed data compares to the rms residual of the original data .",
    "all the frequencies but @xmath101 and @xmath102 listed in table  [ big ] can be identified in the residual spectrum of the time transformed data .",
    "the @xmath103 and @xmath104 modulation sidelobe components can be detected up to higher order harmonics as contrasted with the spectrum of the original data .",
    "the residual scatter of the original @xmath9 light curve was 0.020 mag , the rms scatter of the time transformed data remains the same , 0.020 mag if the modulation components up to the appropriate order are taken into account .",
    "the fourier parameters of the mean pulsation light curve of the time transformed data ( given in the last line in table  [ 20vfour ] ) equal within their error ranges with the average values of the fourier parameters of the observed light curves in different phases of the blazhko cycle .",
    "the residual light curve of the time transformed data also shows large deviations at around minimum - rising branch - maximum phases of the pulsation .    without finding the correct explanation of the blazhko phenomenon we can not decide which characterization of the light curve is correct : the fourier analysis of the light curve as it is , or the separation of the phase and amplitude modulation components of the light curve modulation by an appropriate transformation of the phases ( times ) of the observations",
    "the simplicity and the low number of independent parameters involved in the time transformation applied suggest that this new treatment of the light curve may lead to a headway in the study of blazhko variables .",
    "we also remark that the time transformation can be explained as a continuous change in the pulsation period during the blazhko cycle as @xcite has also interpreted .",
    "the full range of period change determined from the derivative of the phase shift curve is 0.006  days , i.e. @xmath105 . the period of the pulsation is about 0.401  days around blazhko phase 0.65 and 0.395  days around blazhko phase 0.30 as fig .",
    "[ a - p ] shows .",
    "the amplitude of the period variation is somewhat larger than @xcite derived for rr lyrae itself , but keeping in mind that for rr lyr temporal periods were determined for some days long intervals of the observations , most probably a reduced value of its real period change was found .",
    "the photometric observations of mw  lyr analyzed in this paper comprise the most extended and accurate data set of a blazhko variable ever obtained . utilizing this unique opportunity a detailed and circumspect phenomenological description of the modulation",
    "is given , which may provide crucial information to find the correct explanation of the phenomenon .",
    "the main results and conclusions of the analysis are the followings :    * in the fourier spectrum of the light curve besides the @xmath106 triplet frequencies @xmath107 quintuplet , and @xmath108 septuplet components also appear . *",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath99 frequencies can be detected in the spectrum . * frequency components at @xmath109 are detected . if these frequencies are not ` just by chance ' at @xmath110 separations but somehow they are indeed connected to the main modulation frequency , then it is a great challenge to find an answer to their origin . *",
    "modulation with @xmath95 frequency can also be detected in the maximum brightness data but not in the maximum phase observations .",
    "consequently , the modulation connected to the @xmath95 frequency is dominantly amplitude modulation .",
    "* @xcite mentioned the lack of large amplitude modulation around minimum phase of the pulsation as a failure of his model .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation around minimum phase of the pulsation in mw lyr is , however , commensurable with the amplitude of the modulation in maximum brightness . on the contrary ,",
    "the modulation of mw lyrae is more strictly periodic and regular than it would be expected to be if the triggering mechanism behind the modulation were the cyclic weakening and strengthening of the turbulent convection in the ionization zones as @xcite proposes .",
    "* though the modulation shows high degree of regularity both in the phase ( period ) and in the amplitude changes , the light curve can not be fitted with the required accuracy even with 66 identified and further 30 frequencies appearing in the residual spectrum .",
    "significant deviations in the residual light curve are concentrated at the minimum - rising branch - maximum phase of the pulsation .",
    "these residuals , however , do not show any periodicity , most probably they can be explained with some stochastic and/or chaotic behaviour of the modulation itself . *",
    "the mean pulsation light curve defined by the fourier parameters of the @xmath91 pulsation frequency components of the full light curve solution differs significantly from the light curve in any phase of the modulation .",
    "especially the @xmath93 phase differences of the mean light curve are discrepant , they are out of the range of the phase difference values measured in any phase of the blazhko cycle . *",
    "the light curves in the small and large amplitude phases of the modulation can be fitted with 6 - 10 and 11 - 15 order harmonic fits , respectively . if nonlinear effects ( e.g. , shock waves ) account for the occurrence of the higher order harmonic components of the pulsation , then their diminishing amplitudes in the low amplitude phase of the modulation may indicate that these nonlinear effects are not so important in this phase of the modulation . *",
    "@xcite proposed that the enhanced convection lowers the pulsation amplitude in the small amplitude phase of the modulation , while the phase relation betwen the period changes and the amplitude variations depends on the physical parameters of the individual variable in a complex way .",
    "the pulsation period of mw lyr is the longest about 1 - 2 days ( 0.1 phases of the modulation cycle ) later than the minimal amplitude phase , while it is the shortest about 3 - 4 days ( 0.2 phases of the modulation cycle ) later than the maximal amplitude phase . *",
    "the small variations in the phase differences of the lower order harmonic components of the light curves during the blazhko cycle indicate that the phase variations of these frequency components are very coherent .",
    "if the modulation were caused by the interaction of close radial mode and nonradial mode frequencies @xcite , then no such phase coherency would be expected .",
    "* the modulation of the light curve of mw  lyr can be separated into amplitude and phase modulation components using only one parameter , the phase of the @xmath58 pulsation frequency in each phase bins of the modulation .",
    "this is in agreement with the explanation of the blazhko effect with period and amplitude changes as recently proposed by @xcite",
    ".    it would also be important to know how common the detected properties of the light curve modulation of mw  lyrae are .",
    "only further similar observations of other blazhko stars can give an answer to this question .",
