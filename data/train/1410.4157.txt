    "jet quenching [ ] is a powerful probe of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "a perturbative qcd approach based on energy - loss calculations [ ] has been successful in describing the jet quenching data in heavy ion collisions .",
    "one approximation that is inherent in energy - loss based predictions is that the fractional energy loss for the partons is small , i.e. the value @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy of the parent parton and @xmath3 is the energy of the emitted parton in the @xmath4 splitting in the radiative process .",
    "we will refer to this approximation as either small-@xmath0 ( soft gluon ) approximation or energy loss approximation .    in the past several years progress",
    "has been made on extending the perturbative qcd calculations of medium - induced processes beyond the small-@xmath0 approximation .",
    "this became possible with the formulation of an effective theory for jets in the dense qcd matter .",
    "typically , in perturbative calculations the medium is modeled as consisting of effective scattering centers that act as sources of colored coulomb potential  [ ] .",
    "therefore , a successful effective theory must describe the usual vacuum interactions of boosted partons with small invariant mass , as well as elastic scattering of energetic partons off of the medium quasiparticles .",
    "the former interactions are described by the familiar soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) [  ] , and the latter ones need to be added to scet .",
    "the resulting soft collinear effective theory with glauber gluons ( ) was formulated in refs.[ ] . besides being a useful tool for heavy ion collisions",
    ", it is known that has important applications for the drell - yan process  [ ] and for the regge physics  [  ] .",
    "more work is anticipated in these directions .    using , all four medium - induced splitting kernels have been calculated beyond the small-@xmath0 approximation in ref .",
    "[ ] . however , it is not possible to consistently implement these results into the energy - loss formalism .",
    "this is because the energy - loss interpretation is only valid in the soft gluon emission limit . in a more recent work in ref  [ ] we formulated the nuclear modification factor in terms of the medium - modified fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , which in turn are found via dokshitzer - altarelli - parisi - gribov - lipatov ( dglap ) evolution equations  [  ] . in these evolution equations we use the splitting functions based on the calculations [ ] of all medium - induced splitting kernels , valid beyond the small-@xmath0 approximation .",
    "this allowed us to consistently incorporate and study the jet quenching beyond the energy loss approach . in refs .",
    "[ ] the hadron production in deep inelastic scattering has been studied from dglap evolution equations in the medium with initial conditions obtained using the energy loss approach . in the rest of",
    "this talk we concentrate on presenting our results from ref .  [ ] .",
    "let us recall how the vacuum splitting functions in qcd are obtained  [ ] .",
    "first the real emission graphs need to be evaluated . to leading order in the strong coupling",
    "they are given by tree level feynman graphs for the @xmath5 splittings .",
    "next , the virtual graphs need to be evaluated which contribute only for the first two splittings",
    ". alternatively one can take advantage of momentum and flavor sum rules  [ ] and uniquely determine all the virtual pieces . as a result",
    "the first two splitting functions have a plus function ( @xmath6 ) and a delta function pieces ( @xmath7 ) , while the remaining two splittings are not singular as @xmath8 and do not need such a prescription .",
    "the real emission graphs of the medium - induced splitting functions have been calculated in ref . [ ] to first order in the opacity expansion [ , ] . in the presence of dense qcd matter",
    "the splitting functions are defined in the following  way we evaluated the medium - induced splitting kernels @xmath9 which are related to the medium - induced splitting functions as @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the amplitudes in which one of the hard partons in the process splits into two partons ( @xmath13 ) for the vacuum , first order born graphs and contact limit of the second order born graphs correspondingly , @xmath14 is the production amplitude of the hard process before the splitting has occured .",
    "the splitting type is described by the subscript @xmath15 and is one of the four types mentioned above . on the right - hand side of the equation above we made explicit the dependence of the medium - induced splitting function on the fraction of energy carried by the emitted parton @xmath0 , its transverse momentum @xmath16 with respect to the decaying parton @xmath17 , and the properties of the medium @xmath18 . using explicit formulas based on calculations of medium - induced kernels in ref .",
    "[ ] we get @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the real emission parts of the vacuum splitting functions  [ ] and the splitting - type dependent functions @xmath21 are listed in the [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "proceeding by analogy with the vacuum calculation of virtual pieces of splitting functions , we use the flavor and momentum sum rules and find the virtual pieces of the medium - induced splitting functions . for the full splitting functions we get  [ ] @xmath22_++a({{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)\\,\\delta(x)\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & p_{g\\rightarrow gg}(x,{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)=2c_a\\bigg\\{\\left[\\left(\\frac{1 - 2x}{x}+x(1-x)\\right)h_{g\\rightarrow gg}(x,{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)\\right]_+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\,\\,\\,\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad+\\frac{h_{g\\rightarrow gg}(x,{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)}{1-x}\\bigg\\}+b({{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)\\,\\delta(x)\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & p_{g\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}}(x,{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)=p^{\\text{real}}_{g\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}}(x,{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\   & & p_{q\\rightarrow gq}(x,{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)=p^{\\text{real}}_{q\\rightarrow gq}(x,{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta)\\ , , \\label{eq : fullsplittingfunctions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the plus function is with respect to the @xmath0 variable at @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , in the top two equations of eq .   the plus function is associated with the entire square bracket .",
    "for example , in the first line , defining @xmath24 as @xmath8 , we have @xmath25_+$ ] and a virtual piece @xmath26 .",
    "however , if we rewrite this function in terms of @xmath27_+$ ] we would get a virtual piece different from @xmath26 .",
    "note that the apparent singularity of the @xmath28 splitting as @xmath29 need not be regulated by the plus function , as it is regulated by the form of the evolution equations , similarly to the vacuum case for this splitting .",
    "the functions @xmath30 are equal to  [ ] @xmath31h_{g\\rightarrow gg}\\left(x',{{\\bf{q}}}_{\\perp};\\beta\\right)\\bigg\\}\\ , .",
    "\\quad \\label{eq : abvalues}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "having determined the full medium - induced splitting functions , including the virtual pieces , we move on to study the evolution of ffs in the medium .",
    "we use the dglap evolution equations @xmath32\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{\\d d_g(z , q;\\beta)}{\\d",
    "\\ln q}=\\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2)}{\\pi}\\int_{z}^1 \\frac{\\d z'}{z'}\\bigg[p_{g\\rightarrow gg}(z',q;\\beta)d_g\\left(\\frac{z}{z'},q;\\beta\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad+p_{g\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}}(z',q;\\beta)\\sum_{q}\\left(d_q\\left(\\frac{z}{z'},q;\\beta\\right)+d_{\\bar{q}}\\left(\\frac{z}{z'},q;\\beta\\right)\\right)\\bigg]\\ , .\\label{eq : ap30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] first , note that in the equations above we have switched from the @xmath0 variable to the @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "second , the form of evolution equations above is identical to the traditional dglap evolution equations in the vacuum , except one qualitative difference , that the medium - induced splitting functions also depend on @xmath35 ( and medium properties @xmath18 ) , while the vacuum splitting functions only depend on @xmath36 .",
    "the anti - quark ff evolution equation is same as for the quark up to @xmath37 on both sides . because the qgp - induced processes are final - state effects in the heavy ion collisions , one can use the vacuum unmodified parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and only the ffs are subject to medium - effects .    .",
    "we consider the most central pb+pb collisions at the lhc at @xmath38tev and a quark and a gluon jet with @xmath39 .",
    "we present exact solution to dglap evolution equations , small-@xmath0 ( soft gluon ) approximation numerical and analytical solutions , and the energy loss approach .",
    ", width=264 ]    for the special case of the soft gluon approximation , the only two splittings that are relevant are @xmath40 and @xmath28 and the splitting functions become purely plus functions .",
    "also , in the evolution equations in this approximation there is decoupling between the ffs , and each of them evolves independently from the others .",
    "this evolution equation for either of the ffs becomes @xmath41_+d\\left(\\frac{z}{z'},q\\right ) \\ , .",
    "\\qquad \\label{eq : evolutionfull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define the steepness of unmodified vacuum ffs @xmath42 .",
    "we use the approximation that the main support from the convolution integral in the evolution equation comes from the neighborhood of @xmath43 . in this limit",
    ", the logarithmic derivative of the fragmentation function appears on the right hand side of eq .  , and",
    "by using the unperturbed vacuum value for this derivative , we find an analytical approximate formula  [ ] @xmath44 where @xmath45 our approximate method shows explicitly how the medium and vacuum radiative effects factorize , which we emphasized in eq .  .",
    "the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 also depend on @xmath48 via the upper limit of integration in @xmath49 .    the analytical formula obtained in eq .",
    "gives us an insight on the connection between the evolution method in the small-@xmath0 approximation and the energy loss approach .",
    "we see that for small to intermediate values of @xmath36 the entire quenching factor is given by an exponential @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , i.e. controlled by the steepness of the ffs times the fractional energy loss , while for the values of @xmath52 we get @xmath53 , which is the probability of non - branching .",
    "this behavior is the same in the energy loss approach and is an encouraging feature that the two approaches behave qualitatively the same way .    in terms of the evolved ffs",
    "the nuclear modification factor equals @xmath54 where we have chosen @xmath55 ( @xmath56-the factorization scale ) and therefore unmodified hard production partonic cross sections are used @xmath57 _ per binary nucleon - nucleon collision_.    in figure  [ fig : ffevolution ] we compare the medium - induced ffs found from the evolution equations with that from the energy loss approach .",
    "we plot quark and gluon modified ffs for a @xmath58 gev jet created in @xmath38 tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "we show the results for full-@xmath0 evolution ( solid black lines ) , small @xmath0 evolution numerical ( dot - dashed green lines ) , small-@xmath0 evolution analytical ( dotted red lines ) and for the energy loss ( long - dashed blue lines ) approaches .",
    "note that , for both quark and gluon cases , the analytical and numerical small-@xmath0 evolution lines agree well for the most values of @xmath36 . for the quark fragmentation function all the lines including the full @xmath0 numerical and the energy loss results are close to each other . for the gluon case",
    "the differences are more visible especially for @xmath59 .",
    "however the nuclear modification factor is more sensitive to the @xmath60 , because @xmath61 is more quenched due to a larger casimir factor @xmath62 .     in the central pb+pb collisions for @xmath38tev energy .",

    "note that the full @xmath0 dglap evolution method is closer in shape to the data at low @xmath64 where the difference between the approaches is visible .",
    "also note that the best value for in - medium coupling extracted from the full @xmath0 evolution and energy loss approaches compared to data , differs by less than  @xmath65 .",
    "in this talk we reviewed our results from  [ ] .",
    "we formulated the jet quenching phenomenology in the language of dglap evolution equations , where the previously calculated from medium - induced splitting kernels  [ ] are included . by solving the evolution equations analytically in the small-@xmath0 limit we found a deep connection between the evolution and the energy loss approaches .",
    "the evolution approach has an advantage that we can consistently implement the finite-@xmath0 corrections , by turning on all the four medium - induced splitting functions in the evolution equations .",
    "we found a very good agreement between the full-@xmath0 evolution and the energy loss approaches for the nuclear modification factor , with the extracted in - medium coupling found from comparing the two methods to data within @xmath65 .",
    "the finite-@xmath0 corrections are important for making accurate predictions and understanding the theoretical uncertainties on the perturbative qcd side .",
