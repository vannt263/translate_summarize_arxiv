    "the development of new theories will often go astray unless guided and tested by observations or experiments . in the early stages of quantum physics experiments with polarized scattering helped guide the development of the theory .",
    "the experiments by wilhelm hanle in gttingen @xcite led not only to the discovery of the well used hanle effect but at the same time demonstrated the concept of coherent superposition of quantum states and the partial decoherence caused by external magnetic fields . the new quantum theory was built on these concepts .",
    "the literature on experiments with the scattering of polarized light came to an abrupt end around 1935 , apparently because the topic was considered exhausted and less rewarding than other areas , and because the observed phenomena were believed to be sufficiently understood .",
    "the theoretical understanding covered the parameter domain accessible at that time , which in terms of polarimetric sensitivity was unbelievably crude in comparison with what is now possible with modern technology .",
    "therefore the quantum scattering theory never got experimentally tested over a wide range of weak polarization phenomena that are accessible with current instrumentation .",
    "the theory is nevertheless being systematically applied for the interpretation of astrophysical observations in this untested parameter domain .",
    "with the implementation in the 1990s of a new technology ( zimpol ) in solar spectro - polarimetry @xcite , which allowed the recording of the sun s spectrum with a polarimetric precision of @xmath3 , the linearly polarized spectrum ( stokes @xmath4 ) observed near the solar limb was found to be as spectrally structured as the intensity spectrum , but the spectral structures were totally different , it was like uncovering a new spectral face of the sun @xcite .",
    "it is therefore referred to with the term ` second solar spectrum ' , or with the acronym ss2 ( implying that the ordinary intensity spectrum is ss1 ) .",
    "the origin of this polarized spectrum is coherent scattering processes in the sun s atmosphere .",
    "magnetic fields do not produce this spectrum , but they modify it  ss2 is a playground for the hanle effect .    through intense theoretical efforts most of these unfamiliar structures could be identified and understood within the framework of standard quantum scattering theory , revealing remarkable polarization signatures of quantum interference between states of different total angula momenta ( @xmath5 quantum numbers ) , hyperfine structure and isotope effects , optical pumping , molecular scattering , and partial frequency redistribution effects in polarized radiative transfer ( cf .",
    "* for a review ) .    a culmination of the theoretical work to build a comprehensive quantum - mechanical foundation for the radiation - matter interactions occurred with the publication of the monumental monograph by @xcite .",
    "a regular series of international workshops has been devoted to the subject of ` solar polarization ' since 1995 , the latest , no .",
    "7 , in kunming , china , september 2013 @xcite .",
    "the physics of polarized scattering has been a central topic of these workshops .    in spite of these various efforts",
    ", one kind of observed feature in the second solar spectrum has remained enigmatic and stubbornly resisted all attempts to explain it , namely the weak linear polarization peak observed at the center of the nai d@xmath0 line at 5896  and the baii d@xmath0 line at 4934@xcite , although attention to the enigmatic sodium d@xmath0 feature was drawn already in the 1996 paper in _ nature _ @xcite .",
    "the problem is that d@xmath0 type lines , which have angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath6 for both the lower and upper atomic level is expected to be intrinsically unpolarizable , representing polarization ` null ' lines .",
    "however , since both sodium and barium have nuclear spin 3/2 , both the lower and upper levels are split into hyperfine structure states with total angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath7 and 2 .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to explain the observed d@xmath0 polarization in terms of optical pumping of the hyperfine structure levels of the ground state @xcite , but all of them have failed because the predicted d@xmath0 polarization is too small by about two orders of magnitude and has the wrong symmetry ( anti - symmetric polarization profile instead of the observed symmetric one ) @xcite .    to find out",
    "if this enigma is a problem of solar physics or of quantum physics , a laboratory experiment was set up to explore the polarization structure of d@xmath0 scattering under controlled conditions .",
    "the experiment unambiguously showed that there is indeed a problem with the quantum theory of polarized scattering , since the theory predicts null results when the experiment revealed a rich polarization structure @xcite .    in search for ways in which the theory of quantum scattering would need to be extended to explain",
    "what was seen in the laboratory experiment , it was realized that if coherences in _ both _ the initial _ and _ final ground states could be included in the theory for the scattering process , then the atomic system would possess a much richer resonant structure that would be able to generate polarization signatures of the observed kind @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we develop these ideas into a phenomenological extension of current scattering theory and use it to successfully model the observed d@xmath0 polarization in great quantitative detail . through use of experimental data in the well - understood d@xmath2 line to constrain the values of the collisional and optical depth parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 it becomes possible to avoid the use of adjustable parameters when fitting the d@xmath0 data .",
    "after initial attempts failed to do the laboratory exploration of d@xmath0 scattering physics for the sodium d@xmath0 line with the use of a broad - band light source , we realized that a tunable laser was required to achieve the needed s / n ratio with clean separation between the d@xmath2 and d@xmath0 transitions and insignificant stray light . in addition the tuning gives us the precise shapes of the polarization profiles .",
    "we then chose to do the experiment for potassium instead , since solid - state tunable lasers are not available for the sodium wavelength range .",
    "the ki d@xmath2",
    "7665  and the ki d@xmath0",
    "7699  lines have the same quantum number structure as the nai d@xmath2 5890  and the nai d@xmath0 5896  lines , including nuclear spin and hyperfine structure , so it is the same physics that is being tested with potassium as for sodium .",
    "the set - up has been described in detail by @xcite together with examples of the experimental results . here",
    "we provide a summary of what is relevant for the understanding of the theoretical modeling of the data .",
    "the heart of the system is a cross - shaped glass cell that contains the potassium gas .",
    "the cell was tailor - made for our experiment by the late alessandro cacciani in rome , who had perfected the art of building such cells for use in magneto - optical narrow - band filters used in helioseismology and solar magnetometry @xcite .",
    "metallic potassium in the stem of the cell is heated to give potassium gas at a temperature of 100@xmath10 c at the cell center , where the scattering takes place .",
    "an argon buffer gas is used to suppress diffusion of the potassium vapor towards the cooler entrance and exit windows , to avoid deposits that could make the windows opaque .",
    "the spectral band width of the laser beam is not exactly known , but it is at least less than 2m .",
    "this is much smaller than the separation between the @xmath7 and @xmath11 hyperfine levels of the ground state , which is 9.1m , but it is comparable to the corresponding hyperfine splitting of the upper state of the k d@xmath0 line , which is 1.14m .",
    "the expanded laser beam is passed through polarizers that allow us to select one of six states of 100%  fractional polarizations in stokes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 before the beam enters the cell : 100%  @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 .",
    "positive stokes @xmath12 is defined to be linear polarization oriented perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the scanning can be done with either of two separate laser heads , one for tuning around the k d@xmath2 resonance , the other for tuning around the k d@xmath0 resonance .    in the output arm that receives light scattered by the cell at 90@xmath10 , a piezoelastic modulator followed by a linear polarizer converts the polarization information ( stokes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 ) into intensity modulation , at 84khz for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , at 42khz for @xmath14 , while stokes @xmath18 is represented by the unmodulated ( dc ) signal .",
    "a photomultiplier feeds the signal to a lock - in amplifier , which demodulates the ac component .",
    "the combination of 6 alternative input states with three alternative output states for the polarization gives us 18 possible combinations .",
    "for each of them the laser tuning gives us the precise profile shape with mresolution .",
    "furthermore a set of helmholtz coils mounted on the cell allows us to impose on the cell center an external magnetic field with any strength in the range between @xmath19 g , with an orientation that can be chosen to be in either of the three spatial directions : perpendicular to the scattering plane , parallel to the input beam , or parallel to the scattered beam .    because the available parameter space of the experiment is so large , time and manpower only allowed the experiment to be carried out for some strategically selected combinations among the various possibilities . in the present paper we focus on the interpretation of the transverse field case ( field perpendicular to the scattering plane ) for the two combinations ( 1 ) input 100%  @xmath4 polarization , output detection of stokes @xmath12 , and",
    "( 2 ) input 100%  @xmath20 polarization , output detection of stokes @xmath14 .",
    "this selection was done not only because these cases were most thoroughly measured , but because conventional scattering theory predicts null results for case ( 1 ) and nearly null for case ( 2 ) .",
    "this leads us to identify the observed polarization effects for these cases as due to previously overlooked , neglected physics .",
    "let us consider a scattering transition between the magnetic substates labeled @xmath21 ( initial state ) , @xmath22 ( intermediate ) , and @xmath23 ( final ) and introduce the area - normalized complex profile function for radiative absorption : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the transition frequency between the energy levels of the upper and lower magnetic substates , while @xmath26 is the frequency of the incident radiation .",
    "then the kramers - heisenberg formula for the probability amplitude for the scattering process @xmath27 may be written as @xmath28 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the matrix transition elements contain the scalar products between the dipole moment operator ( proportional to the position vector @xmath29 ) and the unit vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the incident and scattered radiation field , respectively .",
    "vector @xmath29 is decomposed in the three spherical vector components labeled by @xmath32 , which equal the difference @xmath33 between the magnetic quantum numbers of the lower and upper states ( with the quantization axis defined to be along the magnetic field vector ) , while the polarization components of the radiation field are real linear unit vectors that reside in the plane that is perpendicular to the propagation direction .    for classical scattering the probability amplitude is represented by the jones matrix @xmath34 where the @xmath35 factors embody the scalar products between @xmath29 and @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "* ) . with our definition of @xmath37",
    ", we have @xmath38 for the case of a @xmath39 absorption transition . in the general quantum - mechanical case",
    "we can write the kramers - heisenberg amplitude in the following analogous form , to bring out the similarlities and differences with respect to the classical case as transparently as possible : @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the transition amplitudes for absorption and emission between the respective magnetic substates .",
    "they are all real quantities , but their relative signs are of importance . all the other factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scatgen ] ) are in general complex - valued quantities .",
    "since the magnetic quantum numbers for the @xmath21 and @xmath23 states may differ , the corresponding @xmath37 indices may also differ , which is the reason for using a prime for @xmath37 in the case of the emission transition . in the classical case @xmath43 , and the three resonances ( corresponding to the three @xmath37 ) have equal probability amplitude and are driven in phase by the incident radiation field . in the quantum case",
    "the scattering amplitudes get weighted by the relative complex amplitudes @xmath44 of the initial state @xmath21 .    to go from the scattering probability amplitudes @xmath45 , which represent the elements of a complex @xmath46 matrix @xmath47 , to obtain the scattering probabilities for the different polarization states ,",
    "one forms the bilinear products @xmath48 , which are elements of a tensor product of type @xmath49 with appropriate summations over the various atomic states .",
    "the standard approach in quantum scattering theory has been the ` sum over histories ' : to obtain the total probability amplitude for scattering from state @xmath21 to state @xmath23 , one sums over the probability amplitudes for all the possible intermediate states , while keeping the initial and final states @xmath21 and @xmath23 fixed .",
    "one then forms the bilinear product to obtain the probabilities , and afterwards sums over all the possible initial and final states @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "this results in a complex @xmath50 coherency matrix * w * of the form @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "there is a very fundamental distinction between the various summations here : while the sum over the intermediate states is _ coherent _ ( done as a linear superposition of the probability amplitudes ) , the sums over the initial and final states are _ incoherent _ ( done over the bilinear products that represent probabilities ) , weighted by the relative populations @xmath52 of the initial states .",
    "the quantum interference phenomena are then exclusively due to the cross products that arise when the sums over @xmath22 and @xmath53 are multiplied with each other .    in the present paper we will present experimental and theoretical evidence that demonstrates that eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmatold ] ) with its separation between coherent and incoherent summations is incorrect , and that instead all summations should be done coherently ( as previously suggested in * ? ? ? * )",
    ". the correct expression should therefore be @xmath54    note that it is absolutely essential to make the summation coherent not only over the initial states ( accounting for the non - diagonal density matrix elements @xmath55 ) , but also use _ coherent summation over the final states_. this rule is demanded both by a theoretical selection rule ( cf .",
    "[ sec : clos ] ) and by the experimental data .",
    "if it is obeyed , then we can reproduce in great detail the results of the laboratory experiment , while if it is disobeyed we get zero polarization in the corresponding test cases . the selection rule in sect .",
    "[ sec : clos ] implies that there is a strict coupling between the initial and final state coherences .",
    "since in this case each sum contains a much larger number of terms , the physical system will contain a much richer set of coherences and quantum interference phenomena , which are prevented in the earlier approach to quantum scattering as represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmatold ] ) .",
    "the new terms allow us to theoretically reproduce the results of our laboratory experiment in great quantitative detail in situations when the old formalism predicts zero polarization .",
    "the practical implementation of the formally simple and symmetric eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmatnew ] ) is however difficult , both conceptually and technically , since we need a way to determine the phase relations between the different ground level amplitudes @xmath44 . in the absence of a radiation field",
    "the relative phases are random . in the presence of an incident radiation field the transverse oscillations of the electric vector drive the dipole resonators of the atomic system .",
    "it is this synchronized driving that produces phase locking between combinations of @xmath44 level amplitudes .",
    "the heart of the problem is how to deal with this phase locking , which must be distinguished from conventional optical pumping , although it may superficially resemble it . to conceptually understand the fundamental distinction between phase locking and optical pumping we need a non - traditional way to look at the nature of quantum transitions , an issue that will be addressed in the next subsection",
    "before proceeding with the theoretical issues , let us already at this stage present experimental evidence that backs up our previous statements . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1qq ] we show the case of 90@xmath10 scattering of k d@xmath0 radiation when the incident light is 100%  linearly polarized perpendicular to the plane of scattering ( incident stokes @xmath56 ) , and we measure stokes @xmath12 of the scattered radiation .",
    "the laser has been tuned across the d@xmath0 resonance , which gives us the profile shape .",
    "standard scattering theory ( eq .  ( [ eq : wmatold ] ) ) predicts exactly zero @xmath12 polarization for all wavelengths , while with eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmatnew ] ) we are able to reproduce the observations in great quantitative detail .",
    "note that the observed @xmath12 is negative ,",
    "i.e. , the scattered radiation is weakliy linearly polarized _",
    "parallel _ to the scattering plane .    in the following sections we will explain what explicitly goes into these calculations , how the theory is extended to include the new physical effects , and how observations of the well - behaved d@xmath2 system are used to constrain the theory and enforce consistency .",
    "an objective is to provide convincing evidence that quantum scattering has a far richer coherency structure than allowed by the old formalism of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmatold ] ) , and to indicate the direction in which the theory should be extended to cover these phenomena .    to conclude this subsection we give the well - known expression for how to obtain the mueller matrix * m *",
    "that describes scattering of the stokes vector from the complex coherency matrix * w * : @xmath57 the complex @xmath50 matrices @xmath58 , @xmath59 in eq.~ ( [ eq : mueller ] ) are purely mathematical transformation matrices without physical contents ( cf .",
    "an obstacle to a more complete understanding of the interaction of the atomic system with the radiation field has been the often prevailing misconception that atomic transitions are instantaneous events , quantum ` blips ' .",
    "to make our conceptual discussion of the interaction process as transparent as possible we will refrain from applying the second quantization formalism with the quantization of the electromagnetic field and instead use a semi - classical approach in which photons are treated as exponentially damped wave packets .    the misconception of instantaneous quantum jumps has been amplified by the circumstance that a theory for polarized optical pumping is only available under the assumption that the incident radiation is broadband in frequency ( the flat - spectrum approximation , cf .  p.  257",
    "although the flat - spectrum assumption only requires the radiation to be spectrally flat over ranges comparable to the doppler width of spectral lines , let us for conceptual clarity first consider the extreme case of complete flatness .",
    "with heisenberg s uncertainty principle",
    "@xmath60 such a case implies that @xmath61 , i.e. , the impinging wave packets have zero coherence length .",
    "such wave packets do not exist in nature .",
    "furthermore , this limitation contradicts the principle that each wave packet can be represented as a linear superposition of its monochromatic fourier components .",
    "while the flat - spectrum approximation does not imply this extreme case of zero coherence length , it does imply wave packets with a coherence length that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than actual wave packets , since the doppler width is typically two orders of magnitude larger than the radiative damping width .",
    "for this reason the implications of this approximation are qualitatively of the kind indicated by our discussion of completely flat radiation .",
    "thus , in terms of hypothetical ( non - existing ) broad - band wave packets the pumping scenario is a sequence of almost discrete pumping events , in which each quantum jump due to radiative excitation is nearly instantaneous . during the relatively long waiting times between each discrete event",
    "the atomic system is subject to the depolarization effects of collisions and magnetic fields ( cf .",
    "the more extended discussion of this topic in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is only meaningful to talk about quantum ` blips ' when a wave packet is recorded in a detector ( collapse of the wave function ) .",
    "before this happens the wave packets are not small entities but huge , with coherence lengths of several meters ( in the absence of collisional effects ) .",
    "the radiative damping constant of potassium d@xmath0 and d@xmath2 is approximately @xmath62s@xmath63 ( determined by the inverse life time of the excited state in the collisionless case ) , implying that the damped emission process takes place over a time of order @xmath64 , which is @xmath65 times longer than the time scale for the oscillation of the electric vector . during this long time",
    "light travels approximately 8 m , corresponding to @xmath65 wavelengths .    with this enormous separation of time scales",
    "wave packets represent ( from the point of view of the atomic system ) a radiation bath . during the interaction with the atomic system the various dipole resonances in the atom",
    "are driven @xmath65 times by the electric field of the single wave packet .",
    "this gives plenty of time to establish synchronization between the phases of the various dipole oscillators represented by the potential radiative transitions between lower and upper magnetic substates . in the case of the d@xmath0 atomic system",
    "there are 36 different allowed combinations of dipole transitions between lower and upper @xmath1 states .",
    "since all of them are subject to the driving force from the same external oscillating electric field ( provided by a single incident wave packet ) , phase synchronizations will be established , depending on the polarization of the incident wave packet .",
    "both the lower and upper @xmath6 states of the d@xmath0 atomic system is split due to the nuclear spin into total angular momentum states @xmath7 ( with three magnetic substates ) and @xmath11 ( with five magnetic substates ) .",
    "there are thus 8 magnetic substates in each of the lower and upper state .",
    "various combinations of the 36 allowed dipole transitions have common @xmath1 states ( either lower or upper ones ) .",
    "for instance , a @xmath66 transition from upper state @xmath67 couples to both @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the lower state .",
    "since both the upwards and downwards transitions are jointly driven by the same oscillating electric field , phase synchronization between the two @xmath67 and @xmath68 lower states will be produced , which then leads to new polarization effects through eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmatnew ] ) .",
    "let us for completeness mention here that the fully quantized formulation of polarized scattering that was pioneered by @xcite does not make use of the flat - spectrum approximation .",
    "although the method is general with the potential of being extended to the multi - level case , it has so far only been implemented for the two - level case .",
    "we have in the previous subsection seen that the wave packet interaction is not associated with instantaneous quantum jumps , but that the atomic system with its various dipole resonators ( 36 in the d@xmath0 case ) is immersed in a radiation bath ( provided by each single wave packet ) , which drives the atomic oscillations and couples combinations of oscillators .",
    "this viewpoint is largely prohibited when the flat - spectrum approximation is used , as indicated in the previous section .",
    "there are nevertheless good reasons why this approximation has represented the established approach , because by removing it we open a ` pandora s box ' of coherency phenomena that we do not know how to properly deal with .",
    "however , by keeping the lid shut on this pandora s box we prevent access to the world of coherency phenomena in which a solution of the d@xmath0 enigma is to be found .    in the present paper",
    "we open the lid to examine the phenomena in this new world and try to show how they are responsible for the observed polarization features in the laboratory experiment . in view of the complexity of the interconnected coherences",
    "our initial approach has to be heuristic and phenomenological in nature rather than representing an attempt at a formulation of a new general theory .",
    "still we go to great lengths to make the phenomenological extension of standard scattering theory well defined , internally consistent , based on the soundest possible arguments , and avoiding free parameters as far as possible .",
    "this effort is only possible with the guidance of experimental data .",
    "the success of our extension is that it is capable of modeling the key experimental data in great quantitative detail .    in the present subsection",
    "we will examine the nature of the various new coherences .",
    "for a conceptual understanding we begin by examining how phase synchronization or phase locking plays out in classical physics .",
    "the equation for a classical oscillator in an external magnetic field can be written as @xmath69 in component form , when instead of the three cartesian spatial coordinates the three complex spherical vector components , labeled with @xmath32 , are used .",
    "the @xmath70 component is aligned along the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath71 is the component of the position vector of the oscillator , @xmath72 is the larmor frequency .",
    "@xmath73 represents the damping due to the radiative energy loss of the oscillating system , and @xmath74 is the resonance frequency of the system ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage of using the complex spherical vectors rather than real linear vectors is that the component equations then decouple and represent three independent oscillators .",
    "still , although the three equations are mathematically uncoupled ( the equation system is diagonalized ) , the three oscillators are phase locked because the three components @xmath75 of the driving oscillating electric field of the external radiation bath are mutually phase locked ( since they are components of the same oscillating vector ) .",
    "the solution of the stationary equation , when the oscillator is immersed in an eternal , monochromatic radiation bath , leads to the profile function @xmath76 , which is proportional to the complex refractive index of the medium .",
    "as the dipole radiation emitted by these oscillators represents the scattered light , we readily obtain the jones scattering matrix in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scatclass ] ) .    the frequency redistribution , i.e.",
    ", the relation between the incident and scattered frequencies , can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : osccomp ] ) as a time - dependent problem @xcite .",
    "the full solution of this problem is the sum of the stationary solution and a transitory solution .",
    "the collisional effects are generally described in two ways : as phenomenologically introduced branching ratios between the stationary and transitory solutions , and as phase truncations of the oscillators , which lead to depolarization . here",
    "we will not deal with the details of such redistribution effects , since they are not crucial for the key issues in the extension of scattering theory .    however , one aspect that is fundamental to this extension and which can be correctly described by the classical theory is the partial decoherence of jointly driven oscillators that have different resonant frequencies . in the absence of magnetic fields ,",
    "the three classical oscillator components have the same resonant frequencies and therefore remain in phase for the duration of the radiation bath , there is no decoherence .",
    "when however there is a frequency split induced by the larmor frequency , the oscillators get progressively out of phase , depending on the ratio between the time scales of larmor precession and radiative decay .",
    "this partial decoherence leads to the polarization effects in the scattered radiation that are covered by the term ` hanle effect ' .",
    "the partial decoherence between jointly driven resonators , i.e. , between jointly driven atomic dipole transitions , is by no means limited to decoherence between the magnetically split transitions ( hanle effect ) , but applies to the relative phase relations and decoherence for any split but jointly driven transitions .",
    "an example is the dramatic polarization effects seen on the sun due to scattering at the caii h and k line system @xcite , two lines of the d@xmath0 ",
    "d@xmath2 type ( although without hyperfine structure ) . in this particular case",
    "the line separation is due to the fine structure splitting ( different @xmath5 quantum numbers ) . in the potassium case that we are dealing with the splitting",
    "is due to hyperfine structure ( different @xmath77 quantum numbers ) , and for non - zero magnetic fields due to zeeman splitting as well .",
    "when forming the bilinear products @xmath48 between the elements of the jones matrix for the scattering probability amplitudes we get interference terms , in which the partial decoherence is contained in the products @xmath78 between the profile factors .",
    "an elegant mathematical transformation is to convert such profile products into sums : @xmath79 @xcite , where the angle @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 in the case of magnetically induced splitting @xmath80 is referred to as the ` hanle angle ' .",
    "the expression is however quite general and is valid regardless of the physical origin of the splitting .    with the conversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiqprod ] ) the interference effects due to the profile product gets factorized into a frequency - independent hanle part @xmath82 and a frequency - dependent part , which becomes unity if we integrate over all frequencies ( since each profile function is area normalized ) .",
    "the hanle part consists of an amplitude factor , which in the scattering polarization corresponds to depolarization , and a phase factor that corresponds to rotation of the plane of polarization .",
    "the classical oscillator case corresponds to the quantum - mechanical case for a @xmath83 scattering transition .",
    "it also consists of three resonators , which link the three @xmath1 state of the upper level to the common , single lower state .",
    "in such a situation @xmath84 , so there can be no lower - level coherences . in the general case when there are more than one lower state , ground - state coherences are possible , but since the coherency terms not only contain the profile products of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiqprod ] ) but also the level amplitude products @xmath85 , these coherences will only play a role if there are correlations between the phases of certain combinations of level amplitudes . in the absence of an external radiation field",
    "the phases are uncorrelated , because there is no coupling between the levels .",
    "remaining lower - level coherences will be erased if the time between collisions is much shorter than the ` waiting time ' between succssive radiative excitations .",
    "the needed synchronization between the phases can however be provided by the oscillating electric field of the wave packet radiation bath , which is a source of coupling or phase locking between combinations of ground states .",
    "the coherences in the initial state are represented by the off - diagonal elements @xmath85 of the density matrix . in the absence of outside disturbances ( external radiation field or collisions )",
    ", each level amplitude oscillates like @xmath86 .",
    "if the energy levels @xmath87 and @xmath88 are not identical , the oscillations will rapidly get out of phase .",
    "let us now assume that the phases get synchronized by the driving oscillating electric field of an incident wave packet , but that the initial phase synchronization decays with the damping rate @xmath73 because the driving electromagnetic wave packet is exponentially damped according to this rate . in the time domain",
    "the density matrix element is then @xmath89 . the time derivative of this expression must for stationarity be balanced by the radiative absorption and emission rates , which represent the interaction between the driving oscillating electric field and the atomic system .",
    "the balance equation then gives us the expression @xmath90 for the corresponding density matrix element , which may more elegantly be written as @xmath91 ( cf .",

    "if the oscillating electric field of the incident radiation has a polarization that leads to radiative coupling between the @xmath21 and @xmath94 states ( via appropriate excited states ) , then we expect the constant of proportionality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : caca ] ) to be close to @xmath95 ( the product between the square roots of the sublevel populations ) , since when the phases of the level amplitudes are synchronized in the radiation bath , the only source of decoherence is the difference in oscillation frequency as expressed by the hanle - type factor in eq .",

    "since the ` waiting time ' between successive radiative absorption events is in general much longer than the time between collisions with the argon buffer gas , much of the population imbalances can be expected to be erased before each scattering event .",
    "we nevertheless did modeling experiments also with inclusion of optical pumping that gives us the populations @xmath52 , but even when the effects of collisions were entirely disregarded in the pumping problem the effects on the scattering polarization were not dramatic .",
    "it was easier to find a good fit to the observations when such pumping was not included .",

    "unfortunately this has the disadvantage that the potassium atoms are subject to a high collision rate , which affects the scattering polarization in significant ways .",
    "the collisions cause line broadening by changing the effective damping constant of the profile functions , as well as depolarization of the emitted radiation .",

    "therefore the net contribution is negative , with the consequence that the already negative non - magnetic scattering @xmath12 polarization gets enhanced .",
    "figure [ fig : d1qbdep ] shows the @xmath18 and @xmath12 profiles for the largest field strength used in our laboratory experiment , 18.7 g . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1qq ] the observations are represented by the dashed curves , the theory by the solid curves .",
    "the geometry and other parameters are the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig : d1qq ] , the only difference being the field strength .",
    "we see that an excellent fit is obtained , which would not have been the case without introducing the finite optical depth @xmath173 .",
    "comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig : d1qbdep ] and [ fig : d1qq ] shows that the profile shapes are almost unaffected by the magnetic field , but the polarization scales in the two figures are significantly different ( although the difference is rather modest ) .    both figs .",
    "[ fig : d1qbdep ] and [ fig : d1qq ] give the ( false ) impression that the theoretical model is unable to reproduce the exact wavelength position of the @xmath12 profiles .",
    "the observational ( dashed ) curves for the @xmath12 profiles are seen to be systematically shifted towards the right relative to the theoretical ( solid ) curves .",
    "the magnitude of the shift is about 2.8m , which corresponds to about 1.7 step sizes in the stepwise wavelength tuning of the laser to scan the line profile .",
    "the probable origin of this shift has to do with the time constant used by the lock - in amplifier when demodulating the polarization information , which for stokes @xmath12 is at 84khz due to the piezo - elastic modulation . to achieve polarimetric sensitivity down into the @xmath3 range one needs maximum temporal integration of the demodulated ac signal before it is read out .",
    "the chosen analog integration time should however be compatible with the scan rate .",
    "if the integration time is longer than the time between tuning steps , there will be a delay and overlap between the steps , resulting in shift and broadening of the demodulated profile .",
    "as such an analog time constant is not applied to the dc ( stokes @xmath18 ) signal , the @xmath12 profile will be shifted ( and slightly broadened ) in the tuning direction with respect to the @xmath18 profile . the observed shift that is of order 1 - 2 tuning steps is a natural consequence of trying to maximize the polarimetric sensitivity of the measurements .",
    "note that the time constant could be much reduced in the d@xmath2 case , since the polarization signals were about 50 times larger .",
    "therefore we do not see any corresponding shift of the @xmath12 profile in the plot for d@xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2qq ] .",
    "let us now turn to the d@xmath0 case when 100%  right - handed circularly polarized incident radiation is used , and stokes @xmath18 and @xmath14 are measured in the scattered radiation .",
    "the geometry remains the same as in our previous discussion of @xmath12 scattering , with the magnetic field being perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the laboratory measurements were made for a sequence of field strengths between @xmath178 g . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1vbdep ] we represent the results as the fractional circular polarization @xmath20(% ) vs. the strength of the vertically oriented field . in this case",
    "@xmath14 represents the wavelength integrated @xmath14 , @xmath18 the integrated stokes @xmath18 profile .",
    "the observations are given by the filled circles and the dashed analytical fit function , while the solid line is obtained with our theory , using the same values for parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 as we used for the modeling of @xmath12 scattering .",
    "in contrast to the linearly polarized case , the incident circular polarization leads to radiative couplings between all the initial @xmath1 states and not only between those with identical @xmath1 quantum numbers , as explained in sect .  [",
    "sec : lockd1 ] .",
    "we notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1vbdep ] the excellent agreement between the solid and dashed curves , in particular the equal slopes of the field dependence , except for fields in the inner range 0 - 2 g .",
    "the remarkable negative peak is centered at the value 0.43 g ( marked by the vertical dotted line in the diagram ) .",
    "this offset from zero can be understood as being caused by the earth s magnetic field , which has a downwards pointing component of approximately this magnitude . to compensate this component",
    "our imposed magnetic field needs to have an upwards ( positive component ) of this magnitude , which leads to the apparent small shift of our field strength scale .",
    "since the earth s magnetic field is not exactly vertical but inclined , the residual field will become horizontal when the vertical field gets compensated , but the azimuth orientation of our experimental setup with respect to the azimuth of this residual horizontal component is not sufficiently known to allow meaningful modeling of this behavior . in the milligauss range in the immediate neighborhood of the @xmath179 g offset we can expect the magnetic - field vector to rapidly change its orientation between vertical and horizontal .",
    "the sharp negative peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1vbdep ] shows that the scattering polarization has enormous sensitivity to the field orientation in this milligauss range .",
    "the existence of this sharp peak indicates that our description of the physical system is still incomplete .",
    "the radiation - matter interaction appears to have a much richer substructure than anticipated .",
    "other laboratory tests that we have made show that when we have horizontal magnetic fields aligned along the propagation direction of the incident radiation and choose this radiation to be 100%  circularly polarized , then not only the scattered stokes @xmath14 , but also the scattered stokes @xmath18 , varies dramatically with the strength of the imposed field .",
    "in contrast to the vertical field case , for which stokes @xmath18 is insensitive to field strength , the horizontal field case leads to a stokes @xmath18 that has a sharp peak around zero field strength and rapidly declines towards zero as the field strength increases @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be readily understood in terms of extreme optical pumping of the medium . with the described geometry either only @xmath180 or @xmath181 transitions will be excited ( depending on the handedness of the incident circular polarization ) .",
    "if for example only radiative excitations that raise the @xmath1 quantum number by + 1 are possible , then all the atoms of the medium will quickly be pumped into the ground state with @xmath182 , from which no more radiative excitation is possible .",
    "this means that the medium becomes transparent and the scattered intensity goes to zero , as observed except for the weak fields around zero .",
    "the stokes @xmath18 peak at zero field strength occurs because there are weak stray fields ( in particular the earth s magnetic field ) , which break the symmetry and prevent the extreme pumping scenario from happening .",
    "the laboratory experiment was also done with the opposite handedness of the input polarization ( 100%  left - handed circularly polarized radiation ) .",
    "the result is the same , except that the sign of the output @xmath20 is reversed ( and consequently the sharp peak at + 0.43 g is positive ) .",
    "the exact sign reversal also happens for the theoretical model , the diagram looks the same if we reflect it in the horizontal axis .",
    "this symmetry behavior implies ( as verified by our theory ) that all the @xmath14 signal in the output radiation comes from the non - zero mueller matrix element @xmath183 , while the other elements of the 4th row , like @xmath184 , are exactly zero .",
    "in contrast to the scattering of @xmath12 polarization , dichroism does not play any role in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1vbdep ] .",
    "the reason is that the term @xmath162 , which represents the longitudinal zeeman effect in the mueller matrix @xmath158 , is zero because we have chosen the magnetic field to be transverse .",
    "therefore the effect of the finite optical depth is to multiply both the scattered @xmath18 and @xmath14 profiles with the same factor , @xmath167 , which differentially suppresses the line core more than the wings .",
    "since it turns out that the scattered @xmath18 and @xmath14 profiles have identical shapes and thus are deformed in the same way by the factor @xmath167 , the fractional polarization , integrated @xmath14 divided by integrated @xmath18 , is not affected .",
    "this is not so in the @xmath12 scattering case , since the @xmath18 and @xmath12 profiles have different shapes , and in addition there is the contribution from @xmath166 , which is non - zero since it represents the transverse zeeman effect .    if we would remove the initial and final state coherences but keep the upper - state coherences ( like in the standard scattering theory of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmatold ] ) ) , then we obtain the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1vbdep ] , which has a slope that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the observations .",
    "if we would also remove the upper - state interferences we would get exactly zero for all field strengths .",
    "this demonstrates that all the polarization effects in @xmath14 scattering for transverse magnetic fields have their origin in coherences between separate magnetic substates , and that the dominating contributions come from coherences in the ground state .",
    "our search for missing physics in quantum scattering was motivated by the observed existence of a small but significant polarization peak in the sun s spectrum of the nai d@xmath0 line at 5896 .",
    "quantum theory appeared to predict that the d@xmath0 line should be intrinsically unpolarizable , and the transverse zeeman effect could be ruled out as a source of the observed polarization .",
    "after a decade of failed attempts to explain this enigmatic feature we decided to set up a laboratory experiment to address the question whether this was a problem of solar physics or quantum physics .",
    "quantum systems often contain an inherently rich and complex structure that is not always fully understood .",
    "the correct application of a complex theory needs guidance from experimental data .",
    "the problem is that the theory of polarized scattering at multi - level atomic systems has never been experimentally tested before in the parameter range that we are addressing here .",
    "this needs to be done before we can have sufficient confidence in the application of the theory to ` messy ' astrophysical environments over which we have no control .    in most cases",
    "when new types of instrumentation allows the exploration of parameter domains that have never been accessed before , surprising new phenomena have been discovered which were not predicted by the theory available at the time .",
    "the d@xmath0 enigma was never expected but was a major surprise when the sun s spectrum could be recorded with high - precision imaging spectro - polarimetry allowing a sensitivity of @xmath3 in the fractional polarization .",
    "laboratory experiments in polarized scattering was a hot topic in the early days of quantum mechanics but they were largely abandoned around 1935 in favor of other topics .",
    "the polarization phenomena that we are discussing here are way out of reach for the experimental technology available at that time .",
    "the aim of our laboratory experiment is not to try to emulate scattering in the solar atmosphere , but to test the basics of d@xmath0 scattering physics under simple and controlled conditions .",
    "the experiment revealed that there is indeed a problem of quantum physics : d@xmath0 exhibits a rich polarization structure in situations where available theory predicts zero polarization .    when abandoning the prevailing ` flat - spectrum approximation ' we open a pandora s box to a new world of coherency phenomena that were excluded before .",
    "in the present paper we show that polarized scattering theory for multi - level atomic systems has to be extended to include _ both _ the initial - state _ and _ final - state coherences ( in addition to the coherences in the excited , intermediate state ) in order to explain the observed polarization structures . with our phenomenological extension of the theory we succeed in reproducing the observations not only qualitatively in terms of profile shapes and signs , but also quantitatively in great detail , both for the scattering of linear and circular polarization in a transverse field geometry .",
    "this gives us confidence that the missing ingredients of the theory have been identified correctly .",
    "there are however also indications that our theoretical extension is far from complete .",
    "experiments with the scattering of circular polarization indicate that there are dramatic effects happening in the milligauss regime of the external magnetic field ( cf .",
    "[ fig : d1vbdep ] ) .",
    "we are presently unable to deal with this regime , because we lack control and knowledge of the strength and orientation of the field in the milligauss range due to the presence of stray fields , including the earth s magnetic field .",
    "an experiment that could properly deal with this issue is likely to reveal additional substructures of the atomic system that have not been identified so far . to fully address the behavior for such weak fields the experiment needs to be set up in a magnetically clean environment , which is not easy but doable .",
    "another deficiency is that we only had access to a vapor cell that used argon buffer gas to prevent condensations on the cooler cell windows . as a consequence the potassium atoms experience a high collision rate ( with @xmath185 ) , which produce large line broadening and depolarization effects .",
    "these effects had to be accounted for in a phenomenological and parametrized way .",
    "in future one would like to do the experiment with a cell that does not use any buffer gas , so that one can explore the clean case of scattering in the collisionless domain .",
    "in the solar chromosphere , where the core of the nai d@xmath0 line is formed , one should approach nearly collisionless conditions , but according to @xcite lower level polarization in nai d@xmath0 will always be destroyed under solar conditions .",
    "ideally one would like an experimental setup that would allow exploration of the scattering polarization as a function of collision rate , by being able to change and control the amount of buffer gas being used .",
    "it is generally problematic to apply an established physical theory to parameter domains in which the theory has never been tested by experiment .",
    "we do not have a theory that has been sufficiently tested experimentally when it comes to the interpretation of scattering polarization from multi - level atomic systems .",
    "experimental exploration of this poorly studied domain may bring unexpected new insights into neglected aspects of quantum physics . in the present paper we have tried to indicate the direction in which the exploration of this domain could take us .",
    "the potassium cell was specially tailor made free of charge for our laboratory experiment by the late alessandro cacciani , who had devoted much of his life to perfect the art of making such cells for magneto - optical filter systems used in helioseismology and solar magnetometry .",
    "the scattering experiment was set up and carried out at eth zurich as part of two phd projects , by alex feller and christian thalmann .",
    "the data bank set up by thalmann for the collection of his laboratory recordings has served as a resource to guide the theoretical efforts .",
