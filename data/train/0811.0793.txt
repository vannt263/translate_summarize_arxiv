    "one of the motivations for using an additional measure of integration in the action principle is closely related to a possible degeneracy of the metric .",
    "solutions with degenerate metric were a subject of a long - standing discussions starting probably with the paper by einstein and rosen@xcite . in spite of",
    "some difficulty interpreting solutions with degenerate metric in classical theory of gravitation , the prevailing view was that they have physical meaning and must be included in the path integral@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in the first order formulation of an appropriately extended general relativity , solutions with @xmath4",
    "allow to describe changes of the space - time topology@xcite,@xcite .",
    "similar idea is realized also in the ashtekar s variables@xcite,@xcite .",
    "there are known also classical solutions@xcite-@xcite with change of the signature of the metric tensor .",
    "the space - time regions with @xmath5 can be treated as having _",
    "metrical dimension _ @xmath6 ( using terminology by tseytlin@xcite ) .",
    "the simplest solution with @xmath5 is @xmath7 while the affine connection is arbitrary ( or , in the einstein - cartan formulation , the vierbein @xmath8 and @xmath9 is arbitrary ) .",
    "such solutions have been studied by dauria and regge@xcite , tseytlin@xcite ) , witten@xcite , horowitz@xcite , giddings@xcite , baados@xcite ; it has been suggested that @xmath7 should be interpreted as essentially non - classical phase in which diffeomorphism invariance is unbroken and it is realized at high temperature and curvature .",
    "now we would like to bring up a question : whether the equality @xmath5 really with a necessity means that the dimension of the space - time manifold in a small neighborhood of the point @xmath10 may become @xmath6 ? at first sight",
    "it should be so because the volume element is @xmath11 note that the latter is the `` metrical '' volume element , and the possibility to describe the volume of the space - time manifold in this way appears after the 4-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath12 is equipped with the metric structure . for a solution with @xmath13 , the situation with description of the space - time becomes even worse .",
    "however , in spite of lack of the metric , the manifold @xmath12 may still possess a nonzero volume element and have the dimension @xmath14 . the well known way to realize it consists in the construction of a differential 4-form",
    "build for example by means of four differential 1-forms @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 .",
    "each of the 1-forms @xmath15 may be defined by a scalar field @xmath18",
    ". the appropriate volume element of the 4-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath12 can be represented in the following way @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the volume measure independent of @xmath21 as opposed to the case of the metrical volume measure @xmath22 . in order to emphasize the fact that the volume element ( [ dv ] ) is metric independent we will call it a _ manifold volume element _ and the measure @xmath23 - a _ manifold volume measure_.    if @xmath24 one can think of four scalar fields @xmath18 as describing a homeomorphism of an open neighborhood of the point @xmath10 on the 4-dimensional euclidean space @xmath25 . however if one allows a dynamical mechanism of metrical dimensional reduction of the space - time by means of degeneracy of the metrical volume measure @xmath22",
    ", there is no reason to ignore a possibility of a similar effect permitting degenerate manifold volume measure @xmath23 .",
    "the possibility of such ( or even stronger , with a sign change of @xmath23 ) dynamical effect seems to be here more natural since _ the manifold volume measure @xmath23 is sign indefinite _ ( in measure theory , sign indefinite measures are known as signed measures@xcite ) . note that the metrical and manifold volume measures are not obliged generically to be simultaneously nonzero .",
    "the original idea to use differential forms as describing dynamical degrees of freedom of the space - time differentiable manifold has been developed by taylor in his attempt@xcite to quantize the gravity .",
    "taylor argued that quantum mechanics is not compatible with a riemannian metric space - time ; moreover , in the quantum regime space - time is not even an affine manifold .",
    "only in the classical limit the metric and connection emerge , that one allows then to construct a traditional space - time description . of course , the transition to the classical limit is described in ref.@xcite rather in the form of a general prescription .",
    "thereupon we would like to pay attention to the additional possibility which was ignored in ref.@xcite .",
    "namely , in the classical limit not only the metric and connection emerge but also some of the differential forms could keep ( or restore ) certain dynamical effect in the classical limit . in such a case , the traditional space - time description may occur to be incomplete . _ our key idea _ is that one of such lost differential forms , the 4-form ( [ dv ] ) , survives in the classical limit as describing dynamical degrees of freedom of the volume measure of the space - time manifold , and hence can affect the gravity theory on the classical level too .",
    "if we add four scalar fields @xmath18 as new variables to a set of usual variables ( like metric , connection and matter degrees of freedom ) which undergo variations in the action principle then one can expect an effect of gravity and matter on the manifold volume measure @xmath23 and vice versa .",
    "as is well known , the 4-dimensional differentiable manifold is orientable if it possesses a differential form of degree 4 which is nonzero at every point on the manifold .",
    "therefore two possible signs of the manifold volume measure ( [ phi ] ) are associated with two possible orientations of the space - time manifold .",
    "the latter means that besides a dimensional reduction and topology changes on the level of the differentiable manifold , the incorporation of the manifold volume measure @xmath23 allows to realize solutions describing dynamical change of the orientation of the space - time manifold .",
    "the simplest way to take into account the existence of two volume measures consists in the modification of the action which should now consist of two terms , one with the usual measure @xmath22 and another - with the measure @xmath23 , @xmath26 where two lagrangians @xmath27 and @xmath28 coupled with manifold and metrical volume measures appear respectively . according to our previous experience@xcite-@xcite in two measures field theory ( tmt ) we proceed with an additional basic assumption that , at least on the classical level , the lagrangians @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent of the scalar fields @xmath18 , i.e. the manifold volume measure degrees of freedom enter into tmt only through the manifold volume measure @xmath23 . in such a case , the action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry @xmath29 where @xmath30 are arbitrary functions of @xmath31 ( see details in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one can hope that this symmetry should prevent emergence of the scalar fields @xmath18 dependence in @xmath31 and @xmath32 after quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "note that eq.([sec-2-s - modif ] ) is just a convenient way for presentation of the theory in a general form . in concrete models ,",
    "the action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) can be always rewritten in an equivalent form where _ each term in the action has its own total volume measure and the latter is a linear combination of @xmath23 and @xmath22_.",
    "varying @xmath33 s , we get @xmath34 where @xmath35 . since @xmath36 it follows that if @xmath37 the constraint @xmath38 must be satisfied , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a constant of integration with the dimension of mass",
    ". variation of the metric @xmath41 gives @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the scalar field build of the scalar densities @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "we study models with the lagrangians of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for affine connection , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "dimensionless factor @xmath49 in front of @xmath50 in @xmath27 appears because there is no reason for couplings of the scalar curvature to the measures @xmath23 and @xmath22 to be equal .",
    "we choose @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the newton constant .",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are the matter lagrangians which can include all possible terms used in regular ( with only volume measure @xmath22 ) field theory models .",
    "since the measure @xmath23 is sign indefinite , the total volume measure @xmath56 in the gravitational term @xmath57 is generically also sign indefinite .",
    "variation of the connection yields the equations we have solved earlier@xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the christoffel s connection coefficients of the metric @xmath21 and @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 the covariant derivative of @xmath21 with this connection is nonzero ( nonmetricity ) and consequently geometry of the space - time with the metric @xmath21 is generically non - riemannian .",
    "the gravity and matter field equations obtained by means of the first order formalism contain both @xmath62 and its gradient as well .",

    ", the consistency of the constraint ( [ varphi ] ) and the gravitational equations ( [ g - mu - nu - varying ] ) has the form of the following constraint @xmath64 which determines @xmath65 ( up to the chosen value of the integration constant @xmath66 ) as a local function of matter fields and metric .",
    "note that the geometrical object @xmath65 does not have its own dynamical equation of motion and its space - time behavior is totally determined by the metric and matter fields dynamics via the constraint ( [ constr - original ] ) .",
    "together with this , since @xmath62 enters into all equations of motion , it generically has straightforward effects on dynamics of the matter and gravity through the forms of potentials , variable fermion masses and selfinteractions@xcite-@xcite .    for understanding the structure of tmt",
    "it is important to note that tmt ( where , as we suppose , the scalar fields @xmath63 enter only via the measure @xmath23 ) is a constrained dynamical system .",
    "in fact , the volume measure @xmath23 depends only upon the first derivatives of fields @xmath63 and this dependence is linear .",
    "the fields @xmath63 do not have their own dynamical equations : they are auxiliary fields . all their dynamical effect is displayed only in the following two ways : a ) in the appearance of the scalar field @xmath62 and its gradient in all equations of motion ; b ) in generating the algebraic constraint ( [ varphi ] ) ( or ( [ constr - original ] ) ) which determines @xmath62 as a function of matter fields and the metric .",
    "let us now study a model including gravity as in eqs.([l1l2 ] ) and a scalar field @xmath67 .",

    "the measure @xmath23 and the metric @xmath21 pass zero only in a discrete set of moments in the course of transition to the @xmath3 state .",
    "therefore there is no problem with the condition @xmath37 used for the solution ( [ varphi ] ) .",
    "also there is no problem with singularity of @xmath41 in the underlying action since @xmath126 the metric in the einstein frame @xmath76 is always regular because degeneracy of @xmath21 is compensated in eq.([gmunuein ] ) by singularity of the ratio of two measures @xmath127 .    in ref.(@xcite ) we have explained in details how the presented resolution of the old cc problem avoids the well known no - go theorem by weinberg@xcite stating that generically in field theory one can not achieve zero value of the potential in the minimum without fine tuning .",
    "it is interesting that the resolution of the old cc problem in the context of tmt happens in the regime where @xmath128 . from the point of view of tmt ,",
    "the latter is the answer to the question why the old cosmological constant problem can not be solved ( without fine tuning ) in theories with only the measure of integration @xmath22 in the action .",
    "let us now turn to the analyze of the results of the tmt model possessing a global scale invariance studied early in detail@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite . the scalar field @xmath67 playing the role of a model of dark energy appears here as a dilaton , and a spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry results directly from the presence of the manifold volume measure @xmath23 .",

    "in contrast to the model of sec.3 , now we deal with exponential ( pre- ) potentials where @xmath104 and @xmath133 are constant dimensionfull parameters .",
    "the remarkable feature of this tmt model is that eq.([varphi ] ) , being the solution of the equation of motion resulting from variation of the manifold volume measure degrees of freedom , breaks spontaneously the scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) : this happens due to the appearance of a dimensionfull integration constant @xmath66 in eq.([varphi ] ) .",
    "one can show@xcite that if @xmath134 then the ground state appears to be again ( as it was in the scalar field model i , see secs.3 and 4 ) a zero cc state without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions in the following two cases : either @xmath106 and @xmath135 or @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "similar to the model of sec.3 , equations of motion resulting from the action ( [ totaction ] ) are noncanonical and the space - time is non riemannian when using the original set of variables .",

    "however , when working with the new metric ( @xmath67 remains the same ) @xmath139 which we call the einstein frame , the connection becomes riemannian and general form of all equations becomes canonical . since @xmath76 is invariant under the scale transformations ( [ st ] ) , spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry is reduced in the einstein frame to the _ spontaneous breakdown of the shift symmetry _",
    "@xmath140 notice that the goldstone theorem generically is not applicable in this theory@xcite .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "in fact , the scale symmetry ( [ phiconst ] ) leads to a conserved dilatation current @xmath141 .",

    "in other words , the constraint describes the local balance between the fermion energy density and the scalar dark energy density in the space - time region where the wave function of the primordial fermion is not equal to zero ; this balance is realized due to the factor @xmath353 . by means of this balance the constraint determines the scalar @xmath65 which appears to be generically a function of @xmath367 .",
    "existence of a noncanonical contribution to the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tmn - noncan ] ) , along with the @xmath62 dependence of the fermion mass ( second equation in ( [ zeta&m ] ) ) means that generically primordial fermions are very much different from the regular fermions in the appropriate field theory model ( with the only volume measure @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is however evident that _ in normal particle physics conditions _",
    ", that is when the energy density of a single fermion is tens of orders of magnitude larger than the vacuum energy density , the balance dictated by the constraint is satisfied in the present day universe only if @xmath368 with an extraordinarily high accuracy .",
    "then the fermion mass ( [ zeta&m ] ) becomes constant and the noncanonical contribution of the fermion into the energy - momentum tensor , eq.([tmn - noncan ] ) , becomes utterly negligible in comparison with the canonical contribution of the fermion into the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "thus , if massive fermions are in normal particle physics conditions , they are described by the standard field theory equations with constant fermion mass , and , under the same conditions , gravitational equations ( [ gef ] ) with the energy - momentum tensor determined by eqs.([tmn])-([zeta12 ] ) are reduced to the einstein equations in the appropriate field theory model ( i.e. when the scalar field , electromagnetic field and massive fermions are sources of gravity ) .",
    "taking into account the undisputed fact that the classical tests of gr deal only with fermionic matter in normal particle physics conditions we conclude that although tmt belongs to alternative gravitational theories , it provides quite standard picture which includes gr and regular particle physics in all cases when the fermion energy density is tens of orders of magnitude larger than the vacuum energy density .",
    "one can suggest two alternative approaches to the question of how a primordial fermion can be realized as a regular one ( see details in sec.6.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "reproducing einstein equations when the primordial fermions are in the states of the regular fermions is not enough in order to assert that gr is reproduced .",
    "the reason is that at the late universe , as @xmath369 , the scalar field @xmath67 effective potential is very flat and therefore due to the yukawa - type coupling of massive fermions to @xmath67 , ( the r.h.s . of eq.([phief+ferm1 ] ) ) , the long range scalar force appears to be possible in general .",
    "the yukawa coupling `` constant '' is @xmath370 . applying our analysis of the meaning of the constraint , it is easy to see that for regular fermions with @xmath371 the factor @xmath353 is of the order of the ratio of the vacuum energy density to the regular fermion energy density .",
    "thus we conclude that the 5-th force is extremely suppressed for the fermionic matter observable in classical tests of gr .",
    "it is very important that this result is obtained automatically , without tuning of the parameters and it takes place for both approaches to realization of the regular fermions in tmt .",
    "it turns out that besides the normal particle physics situations , tmt predicts possibility of so called neutrino dark energy@xcite . roughly speaking such exotic state",
    "may be created in tmt if the degree of localization of the fermion is very small . a possible way to get up such a state might be spreading of the wave packet of non - relativistic neutrino lasting a very long ( of the cosmological scale ) time .",
    "we have studied in detail a model@xcite where the spatially flat frw universe filled with the homogeneous scalar field @xmath67 and a cold gas of uniformly distributed non - relativistic neutrinos .",
    "then the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) takes the form @xmath372 - 2v_{2}}{(\\zeta + b)^{3/2}}=\\frac{(\\zeta -\\zeta^{(n)}_{1})(\\zeta -\\zeta^{(n)}_{2})}{(\\zeta + k)^{2}}\\mu_{n } \\frac{const}{a^{3 } } , \\label{constraint - toy}\\ ] ] where we have used that @xmath373 and @xmath108 is the scale factor .",
    "there is a solution where the decaying fermion contribution to the constraint @xmath374 is accompanied by approaching @xmath375 in such a way that @xmath376 . then both the r.h.s . and the l.h.s . of the constraint ( [ constraint - toy ] ) approach a constant",
    "if @xmath195 as @xmath377 .",
    "the effective mass of the neutrino in this state increases like @xmath378 and therefore @xmath379 . at the same time",
    "this means that at the late time universe , the canonical neutrino energy density @xmath381 becomes negligible in comparison with the non - canonical neutrino energy density @xmath382 .",
    "it follows then from eq.([tmn - noncan ] ) that such cold neutrino matter possesses a pressure @xmath383 and its equation of state in the late time universe approaches the form @xmath384 typical for a cosmological constant .",
    "therefore _ the primordial non - relativistic neutrino in the described regime behaves as a sort of dark energy _ and contributions of the quintessence - like field @xmath67 and the primordial neutrino into the dark energy density are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we refer to this regime as cosmo - low - energy - physics ( clep ) state .",
    "the surprise is that such a clep state is energetically more preferable@xcite than the one in the absence of fermions case .    for a particular value of the parameter @xmath385 .",
    "the cosmological equations allow the following analytic solution@xcite for the late time universe in the clep regime : @xmath386 where @xmath387 the mass of the neutrino in such clep state increases exponentially in time and its @xmath67 dependence is double - exponential : @xmath388 .",

    "there exists however another solution if one to allow a possibility that in the core of the support of the fermion wave function the local dark energy density may be much bigger than the vacuum energy density .",
    "such a solution turns out to be possible as fermion density is very big and @xmath62 becomes negative and close enough to the value @xmath391 .",

    "recall that for simplicity we have chosen here @xmath397 .",
    "but if one do not to imply this fine tuning then one can immediately see from eqs.([gef])-([veff2 ] ) that in the einstein frame the regime of the strong gravity dictated by the dense fermion matter is manifested for the dilaton too .",
    "the coupling constant in eq.([selfinter ] ) is dimensionless and depends exponentially of the dilaton @xmath67 if one can regard @xmath67 as a background field @xmath398 .",
    "but in a more general case eq.([selfinter ] ) may be treated as describing an anomalous dilaton - to - fermion interaction very much different from the discussed above case of interaction of the dilaton to the fermion matter in normal conditions where the coupling constant practically vanishes .",
    "such an anomalous dilaton - to - fermion interaction should result in creation of quanta of the dilaton field in processes with very heavy fermions .",
    "the probability of these processes is of course proportional to the newton constant @xmath399 .",
    "but the new effect consists of the fact that the effective coupling constant of the anomalous dilaton - to - fermion interaction is proportional to @xmath400 .",
    "if the dilaton is the scalar field responsible for the quintessential inflation type of the cosmological scenario@xcite then one should expect an exponential amplification of the effective coupling of this interaction in the present day universe in comparison with the early universe .",
    "one can hope that the described effect of the strong gravity might be revealed in the lhc experiments in the form of missing energy due to the multiple production of quanta of the dilaton field ( recall that coupling of the dilaton to fermions in normal conditions practically vanishes and therefore the dilaton will not be observed after being emitted ) .",
    "it turns out that the main results of tmt concerning the decoupling and the restoration of the einstein s gr in the scale invariant model @xcite,@xcite involving fermions and discussed in the previous section , remain also true in a macroscopic description of matter .",
    "in addition to the dilaton @xmath67 dynamics studied in sec.5 , our underlying model now involves dust as a phenomenological matter model : @xmath401 and @xmath209 , @xmath325 are defined in eq.([totaction ] ) where again we take for simplicity @xmath402 .",
    "we assume that the dimensionless parameters @xmath132 and @xmath403 are positive and have the same or very close orders of magnitude @xmath404 and besides @xmath405 .",
    "the matter lagrangian ( [ lm ] ) describes collection of particles with the same mass parameter @xmath406 ; @xmath407 is an arbitrary parameter .",

    "it is convenient to proceed in the frame where @xmath410 , @xmath411 .",
    "then the particle density is defined by @xmath412 where @xmath413 and @xmath414    following the standard procedure described in sec.5.1 , including a spontaneous breakdown of the global scale symmetry ( [ st ] ) by means of eq.([varphi ] ) and transition to the new metric ( [ ct ] ) , we obtain the gravitational equations ( [ gef ] ) with the following energy - momentum tensor @xmath415 \\label{t00}\\\\\\ ] ] @xmath416\\label{tkl}\\ ] ] where @xmath417 is the particle density in the einstein frame while the dilaton @xmath67 field equation reads @xmath418   -\\frac{\\alpha}{m_{p}(\\zeta + b_{g})^{2 } } \\left[(\\zeta + b_{g})m^{4}e^{-2\\alpha\\phi / m_{p}}-(\\zeta -b_{g})v_{1 } -2v_{2}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ = \\frac{\\alpha}{m_{p}}\\,\\frac{\\zeta -b_m + 2b_g}{2\\sqrt{\\zeta + b_{g}}}\\ , m\\,\\tilde{n }   \\label{phief-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the scalar field @xmath62 is determined as a function @xmath419 by means of the constraint @xmath420    one can immediately see the surprising coincidence very similar to that we noticed in the case of fermions ( see paragraph after eq.([constraint ] ) ) : the explicit @xmath421 dependence involving _ the same form of @xmath62 dependence _",
    "@xmath422 appears simultaneously in the noncanonical dust contribution to the pressure ( through the last term in eq .",
    "( [ tkl ] ) ) , in the effective dilaton to dust coupling ( in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ phief-1 ] ) ) and in the r.h.s . of the constraint ( [ constraint2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "let us analyze consequences of this wonderful result in the case when the matter energy density ( modeled by dust ) is much larger than the dilaton contribution to the dark energy density in the space region occupied by this matter .",
    "evidently this is the condition under which all classical tests of einstein s gr , including the question of the fifth force , are fulfilled .",
    "therefore if this condition is satisfied we will say that the matter is in _",
    "normal conditions_. the existence of the fifth force turns into a problem just in normal conditions .",
    "the last terms in eqs .",
    "( [ t00 ] ) and ( [ tkl ] ) , being the matter contributions to the energy density ( @xmath423 ) and the pressure ( @xmath424 ) respectively , generally speaking have the same order of magnitude .",
    "but if the dust is in the normal conditions there is a possibility to provide the desirable feature of the dust in gr : it must be pressureless .",
    "this is realized provided that in normal conditions ( n.c . )",
    "the following equality holds with extremely high accuracy : @xmath425 inserting ( [ decoupling - cond ] ) in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ t00 ] ) we obtain the effective dust energy density in normal conditions @xmath426 substitution of ( [ decoupling - cond ] ) into the rest of the terms of the components of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ t00 ] ) and ( [ tkl ] ) gives the dilaton contribution to the energy density and pressure of the dark energy which have the orders of magnitude close to those in the absence of matter case .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ decoupling - cond ] ) is not just a choice to provide zero dust contribution to the pressure .",
    "the detailed analysis shows that the constraint ( [ constraint2 - 1 ] ) describes a balance between the pressure of the dust in normal conditions on the one hand and the vacuum energy density on the other hand .",
    "this balance is realized due to the condition ( [ decoupling - cond ] ) .    besides reproducing einstein equations when the scalar field and dust ( in normal conditions )",
    "are sources of the gravity , the condition ( [ decoupling - cond ] ) automatically provides a practical disappearance of the effective dilaton to matter coupling . a possible way to see this consists in estimation of the yukawa type coupling constant in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ phief ] ) . using the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) and representing the particle density in the form @xmath427 where @xmath321 is the number of particles in a volume @xmath428",
    ", one can make the following estimation for the effective dilaton to matter coupling `` constant '' @xmath429 defined by the yukawa type interaction term @xmath430 ( if we were to invent an effective action whose variation with respect to @xmath67 would result in eq .",
    "( [ phief ] ) ) : @xmath431 we conclude that _ the effective dilaton to matter coupling `` constant '' in the normal conditions is of the order of the ratio of the `` mass of the vacuum '' in the volume occupied by the matter to the planck mass taking @xmath321 times_. in some sense this result resembles the _",
    "archimedes law_. at the same time eq .",
    "( [ archimed ] ) gives us an estimation of the exactness of the condition ( [ decoupling - cond ] ) .",
    "thus our model , formulated both in the microscopic manner ( for fermions ) and in the macroscopic manner ( for dust ) , not only explains why all attempts to discover a scalar force correction to newtonian gravity were unsuccessful so far but also predicts that in the near future there is no chance to detect such corrections .",
    "this prediction is alternative to predictions of other known models@xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is worth here to stress two crucial distinctions between our approach and models of refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "first , our approach is based on first principles without introducing into the underlying action any exotic terms intended to reach desirable results .",
    "in contrast to this , models @xcite-@xcite are semi - phenomenological .",
    "second , in models based on coupled quintessence@xcite and other variable mass particle ideas@xcite , the suppression of the effective quintessence to baryon matter coupling is realized by means of the appropriate choice ( made by hand ) of parameters depending of particle species ( or abnormally weighting matter sector in ref.@xcite ) . besides , in the chameleon model@xcite , suppression of the effective quintessence to baryon matter coupling is achieved due to a dependence of the scalar field mass upon the matter density . in our model ,",
    "the coupling `` constant '' of the quintessence to matter depends directly upon the matter density and automatically , without any special tuning of the parameters , this coupling `` constant '' becomes practically zero if matter is in normal conditions .",
    "possible cosmological and astrophysical effects when the normal conditions are not satisfied may be very interesting . in particular , taking into account that all dark matter known in the present universe has the macroscopic energy density many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy density of visible macroscopic bodies , we hope that the nature of the dark matter can be understood as a state opposite to the normal conditions .",
