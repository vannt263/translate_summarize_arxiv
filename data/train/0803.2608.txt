    "in recent years the discovery of the regulatory role of short rna sequences has changed the view about the biological role of rna in living organisms @xcite . for a long time",
    "it was assumed that rna had only an ancillary role in protein synthesis .",
    "today biologists know several regulatory mechanisms fully controlled by rna short sequences @xcite often characterized by a typical secondary structure presenting a certain number of hairpin structures . a rna hairpin structure is a secondary structure where a double stranded region of a single stranded rna is formed by base - pairing between complementary base sequence on the same strand .",
    "rna regulatory secondary structures have been detected in almost all living organisms ranging from viruses to homo sapiens .",
    "the earlier discoveries of their regulatory role have been performed in model organisms such as the little worm @xmath0 @xcite and in studies of the interaction between plants and viruses @xcite .",
    "small noncoding rna regulatory sequences are often characterized by the presence of hairpin structures .",
    "hairpin structures have been investigated in quite different organims with a variety of methods .",
    "examples of these studies can be found in ref.s @xcite    in this paper we detect candidate rna secondary structures which are characterized by a minimal value of the free energy of the strucure in the folded state . in a first investigation",
    "the free energy is estimated by using mfold , which is a reference software for the estimation of the free energy of rna secondary structures .",
    "the free energy of the folded rna structure is compared with the one numerically observed for a random rna sequence obtained by shuffling the base pairs of the real one .",
    "this first investigation has been performed in a large set of 1212 complete genomes of viruses .",
    "we have chosen to perform a comprehensive investigate of these organisms because viruses present a variety of genomic structures and organization and there are indications that small rna structures play important antiviral roles in plants and insects . although the details about interactions between viruses and the host silencing rna machinery remain poorly understood there is a mounting evidence that rna motifs may play a crucial role in different aspects of the viral life - cycle .",
    "results about the biological role of rna secondary structures in different regions of different families of viruses are known only for a limited set of specific viruses with a focus on their coding regions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to perform a comprehensive investigation covering a large number of the complete genomes of viruses today available .    in a second investigation focused on the important viral family of herpesviridae",
    "we perform a search of rna secondary structures by using rnaz @xcite .",
    "this is a computer program based on thermodynamic and comparative genomic indicators .",
    "it has been used to detect evolutionary conserved rna secondary structures in several organisms @xcite .",
    "we apply it to a large number of complete genomes of herpesviruses and search for candidate rna secondary structures detected in coding and noncoding conserved genome regions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we illustrate the data set we investigate .",
    "section 3 discusses the method we use to search rna secondary structures . in this section a detailed discussion",
    "is done about the limits of validity of random null hypothesis used to point out the predicted rna secondary structures .",
    "section 4 presents the results about the predicted rna secondary structures detected in the investigated viruses when they are grouped according to their type of nucleic acid .",
    "section 5 presents the investigation performed with the rnaz program in the family of herpesviruses and section 6 briefly concludes .",
    "this study aims to investigate the presence of potential rna secondary structures in a large set of complete genomes of viruses . for this reason ,",
    "we analyze 1832 complete segments of 1212 complete viral genomes recently available .",
    "this set of complete genomes was downloaded from the genbank database @xcite in april 2006 .",
    "several classification systems of viruses exist being mainly based on phenotypic characteristics , including morphology , nucleic acid type , mode of replication , host organisms , and the type of disease they cause . in the present study",
    "we choose to focus on the casjens and king @xcite classification of viruses .",
    "they classified viruses into 4 groups essentially based on type of nucleic acid .",
    "specifically they consider the following four groups : ( i ) double stranded dna viruses , ( ii ) single stranded dna viruses , ( iii ) double stranded rna viruses , and ( iv ) single stranded rna viruses .",
    "viral complete genomes can be structured in one or more segments .",
    "our set of completely sequenced segments of complete genomes of viruses comprises 310 dsdna segments , 326 ssdna segments , 896 ssrna segments , and 300 dsrna segments .",
    "the size of different segments of viral genomes ranges from 220 bp to 1.18 mbp .",
    "the distribution of the segment length of investigated viruses is quite heterogeneous with many segments shorter than @xmath1 bp and a limited number of long segments .",
    "an overview of the length heterogeneity of considered segments is obtainable from fig .",
    "[ length ] where the ranking plot of the segment lengths is shown .",
    "the total number of base pairs of our set of complete genomes is 28,56 mbp .",
    "they include 23,92 mbp for coding regions , and 4,65 mbp for noncoding regions .",
    "we point out this aspect because our analysis for each virus is performed by distinguishing the detected structures in coding and noncoding regions .    to complete the information about the analyzed set of viral segments , we provide a statistical summary of the cg content of viral segments .",
    "this information is provided in table [ cg ] .",

    "we detect candidate rna secondary structures in rna sequences of the viral segments by computing the minimum free energy structures predicted by the mfold ( version 3.2 ) software @xcite .",
    "this widely used software estimates the difference between the free energy of the unfolded state from the one of the folded state of a rna sequence .",
    "calculations are performed with the temperature parameter sets to 37 degree celsius for all sequences .",
    "the investigated segments of the complete genomes are scanned with mfold by using a sliding window of 80 bp moving in steps of 40 bp .",
    "each selected rna sequence is folded as a linear rna sub - sequence . for each",
    "obtained value of the free energy @xmath43 associated with each investigated 80 bp rna sequence , we estimate a z - score @xmath44 by comparing the observed free energy @xmath43 with the mean value @xmath45 and standard deviation @xmath46 of the free energy computed by performing 100 mononucleotide shuffling of the considered 80 bp rna sequence .",
    "the mfold algorithm estimates the minimum free energy by adding a negative stacking energy of base pairs ( which is stabilizing the secondary structure ) and a positive energy term ( which is destabilizing the secondary structure ) associated with non - complementary bases @xcite , i.e. hairpin loops , interior / bulge loops and multiloops .",
    "a stabilizing energy contribution comes form the stacking energy between two adjacent base pairs .",
    "this is the reason why workman et al .",
    "@xcite , and rivas et al .",
    "@xcite , have concluded that an appropriate null hypothesis as random rna sequence should be generated by taking into account the empirically observed dinucleotide frequency .",
    "on the other hand , investigations of rna secondary structures in the coding region of hepatitis c virus @xcite have shown that in members of the flaviviridae mononucleotide shuffling and dinucleotide shuffling produce free energy values ( and therefore z - scores associated to them ) which are remarkably similar . in other words , the use of the computationally more convenient mononucleotide shuffling is providing results compatible with the use of a dinucleotide shuffling in this family of viruses . supported by this observation",
    "we have devised a test to assess whether a mononucleotide shuffling could be used as a good proxy for a dinucleotide shuffling in our investigations .",
    "specifically , we perform a dinucleotide shuffling for the set of 378 largest viral segments .",
    "the total length of these largest segments is 22.2 mbp which amounts to 84% of the total length of the entire viral data set investigated by us .",
    "they have 18.9 mbp of coding regions and 3.3 mbp of noncoding regions .",
    "the dinucleotide shuffling is performed by using the shuffle program included in hmmer 2.2 package @xcite .",
    "this program shuffles an rna sequence while preserving both mononuclotide and dinucleotide composition exactly .",
    "it uses the altschul and erickson algorithm @xcite . to limit computer time we estimate the relation between the z - score obtained by considering a mononucleotide shuffling and the z - score obtained by considering a dinucleotide shuffling only for the sequences characterized by a mononucleotide z - score smaller than -2 .",
    "the results of our extensive test are shown in fig .",
    "[ shuff ] .",
    "the figure clearly show that the mononucleotide shuffling is a good proxy of the dinucleotide shuffling in the large set of investigated viral segments .",
    "for this reason in the rest of this paper we will use the z - score computed by using a mononucleotide shuffling of the investigated sequences .",
    "for each rna sequence of 80 bp we compute the optimal secondary structure according to the mfold software and we associate to each rna sequence a z - score .",
    "the lower is the obtained z - score the lower is the probability that the considered folding occurred by chance . by performing our large scale investigation",

    "our data clearly indicate that the number of hss detected in the real viral segments is much higher than the one observed for the corresponding null hypothesis obtained for random segments generated with mononucleotide shuffling of real data . a higher number than the one expected under the null hypothesis is observed both in coding and in non - coding regions .",
    "this feature is more pronounced when we condition the analysis to rna sequences characterized by low values of the z - score .",

    "in fact when we condition the analysis to rna sequences with z - score smaller than -5 we observe a ratio of 8.0 in the coding regions whereas we observe a ratio of 63 in noncoding regions . in summary hss",
    "are much more abundant in viruses than expected under a simple but representative null hypothesis .",
    "the abundance is quite remarkable in noncoding regions where the hs - ratio reaches a value as high as 63 when the analysis is conditioned to low values of the z - score of the rna sequence .",
    "the results summarized in table [ hs - all ] for the complete group of viral segments can be analyzed in more detail in terms of the 4 groups we use to classify the investigated viruses .",
    "several investigations of ssrna viruses such as the hepatitis g virus @xcite or the hepatitis c virus @xcite and virus of the family flaviviridae @xcite have concluded that rna secondary structures are present in the coding regions of these viruses and some of them are also evolutionary conserved .",

    "it is worth noting that the hs - ratio in dsdna and dsrna viruses is however significantly larger than one .",
    "this is an indication that the rna secondary structures where these hss are located might also have a potential biological role .",
    "just to provide a comparative evidence that these values are significantly higher than one we have performed our analysis on one chromosome of a model organism .",
    "specifically we have investigated chromosome v of the _ c. elegans_. when we perform our analysis on the coding regions of this chromosome we obtain the following values for the hs ratio : 1.17 when @xmath47 , 1.22 when @xmath48 , 1.16 when @xmath49 , 1.10 when @xmath50 , 1.10 when @xmath51 , 1.62 when @xmath52 and 1.86 when @xmath53 .",
