    "despite more than twenty years of intense effort , the telltale evidence of competing order parameters in the phase diagram of high temperature cuprate superconductors remains an enigma .",
    "other than antiferromagnetism of the undoped materials ,  @xcite and stripe order at special doping and special materials ,  @xcite not much is truly understood .",
    "yet , the attractive option of classifying the pseudogap as a broken symmetry state has spurred intense interest .",
    "@xcite indeed , this option has the great power to unify the diverse phenomenology of these materials .",
    "we are strongly motivated by the recent quantum oscillation measurements  @xcite to address this question anew .",
    "these are the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect , the de haas - van alphen ( dhva)effect and the oscillations of the hall coefficient ( @xmath5 ) . the rapidly evolving experimental situation suggests , under various circumstances , evidence of commensurate and incommensurate order .",
    "it is perhaps best at this time to explore as thoroughly as possible both kinds of order within a very general framework .",
    "such a framework is provided by the hartree - fock theory .",
    "our basic assumption , justified when compared to experiments , is that the observed quantum oscillations in high magnetic fields and low temperatures in underdoped @xmath4 arise from the landau levels of the quasiparticles of the fermi liquid corresponding to the putative normal state .",
    "it is known , and shown here , that in the mixed state of many superconductors the oscillations remain unshifted in their frequencies from the normal state but exhibit increased damping .",
    "thus , the beauty of the present experiments is that one can in principle determine the closed fermi surfaces , through the onsager relation that involves only the fundamental constants and the fermi surface area , of the normal state without having to cross the upper critical field . at face value",
    "these observations have revealed some striking facts not noticed previously .",
    "@xcite the most important of which is the existence of both positively and negatively charged quasiparticles in a hole doped cuprate at variance with the conventional wisdom . that these particles behave like quasiparticles in a fermi liquid , even in the underdoped regime , which has so far been plagued with complex theoretical concerns involving the proximity to a mott insulator ,  @xcite is striking to say the least and",
    "should be of great value in uncovering the mystery of these enigmatic superconductors .",
    "one of us has elaborated on the striking nature of these discoveries and has explained that the root of these observations is the fermi surface reconstruction due to broken symmetries .",
    "@xcite one of us has also elucidated the role of commensurate singlet @xmath0-density wave ( ddw ) to explain the oscillations of the hall coefficient .",
    "@xcite the hall measurement is more telling than either sdh or dhva because it contains the striking information regarding the sign of the charge carriers .",
    "there is evidence of the presence of electron pockets in what is really a hole doped material , which is difficult to explain without spontaneously breaking symmetries in the putative normal state , in particular by the featureless liquid of resonating valence bond theories .",
    "@xcite    for a particle - hole condensate , which ddw is , the symmetry of the orbital wave function does not constrain the symmetry of the spin wave function .",
    "@xcite triplet ddw has not yet been adequately explored and remains a subject for future work .",
    "the more recent experiments have , however , revealed some indication of an incommensurate ordering ,  @xcite which was only briefly touched upon previously .",
    "@xcite here we focus on the incommensurate case .    before we begin , it is important to state what a hartree - fock theory can or can not accomplish .",
    "a hartree - fock theory can identify the possible broken symmetries and phases , but can not establish that such symmetries are indeed broken .",
    "the prime deficiency is the absence of all fluctuation effects , but often such deficiencies can be remedied by educated guesses . of course ,",
    "deep inside a broken symmetry phase critical fluctuations are absent and some of the collective modes can be physically identified from the symmetries of the order parameters .",
    "most importantly , symmetries protect the hartree - fock calculations ; those properties that are determined by the symmetries alone can be determined in the weak interaction limit , where the calculations are better controlled , from a suitable effective hamiltonian .",
    "the results protected by symmetries should be at least qualitatively valid even in the strong interaction limit .",
    "@xcite however , the thermal properties in low dimensional systems are badly predicted by the hartree - fock theories , because fluctuations are often very important .",
    "nonetheless , it is expected that the results at zero temperature retain a considerable degree of validity , except close to quantum critical points where quantum fluctuations become important .",
    "when a commensurate one - dimensional ( @xmath6 ) charge density wave ( cdw ) is doped , the resulting charges may be viewed as defects in the cdw .",
    "if the interactions between them are sufficiently strong compared to their effective kinetic energy , then they will form an ordered lattice ( which can be stabilized by a crossover to three dimensions if there are many @xmath7 chains coupled together ) of defects and the cdw will become incommensurate with the lattice .",
    "this can be energetically more favorable than simply doping holes into the rigid band formed in the presence of cdw order at a fixed wavevector .",
    "the reason , in the latter case , is the single - particle energy gap of the cdw . in a two - dimensional ddw state ,",
    "however , there are nodes in the order parameter , so it may be more favorable for doped holes to simply go to the nodes and expand into fermi pockets ( in quasi-@xmath7 systems , however , this might not be possible , so doping must lead to incommensurability  @xcite ) . however , this can not persist indefinitely if the ddw state is stabilized by approximate nesting , since the fermi surface would eventually move away from the nesting wavevector .",
    "thus , incommensurate ddw order is a possibility , at least over a range of doping . in this paper",
    ", we explore the phenomenology of this possibility .",
    "but it is very difficult to determine if this incommensuration happens before the commensurate gap collapses and some other order takes over . in this respect the tendency of the spin density wave ( sdw ) to incommensurate is stronger because it is gapped everywhere on the fermi surface , being intrinsically a @xmath8-wave object .    near half - filling , the hubbard model , the @xmath9 model , and generalizations of these",
    "appear to have many phases which are close in energy .",
    "thus , small perturbations can strongly influence the competition between them .",
    "consequently , it should not be too surprising that experiments on the cuprate superconductors have also uncovered some evidence for a cornucopia of phases , particularly on the underdoped side of the phase diagram , which appear in particular materials and for certain values of the doping level , temperature , magnetic field , etc .",
    "depending on the interfacial energies between these phases , one way in which their competition can be resolved is through the formation of stripes  @xcite or other inhomogeneous patterns of microscale phase - separation .",
    "furthermore , as the cuprates are doped , their fermi surfaces evolve away from the two - fold commensurate nesting wavevector @xmath10 , so we would expect translational symmetry - breaking order parameters to occur at incommensurate wavevectors .",
    "hence , it would seem important for any theory of the pseudogap to incorporate the tendency towards incommenuration , which we take as further impetus to study incommensurate order parameters related to ddw order , the ic - ddw . direct attempts to measure ddw order through neutron scattering",
    "have neither ruled it out  @xcite nor unambiguously verified its presence , but there are intriguing suggestions that it may be present  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii the construction of both commensurate and incommensurate order parameters are discussed .",
    "this discussion serves to motivate our principal approximations .",
    "iii on fermiology is the heart of our paper .",
    "we begin with the calculation of the electronic spectra of a chosen ic - ddw order and deduce the corresponding areas of fermi pockets that , through the onsager relation , lead to the oscillation frequencies .",
    "the similarity of these results with the spiral sdw scenario is explained .",
    "higher order commensurate ddw results are also discussed .",
    "these also turn out to be similar to the anti - phase spin stripe calculations .",
    "@xcite thus , simply from a hartree - fock calculation it is not possible to single out a mechanism .",
    "one must invoke other considerations to distinguish between mechanisms .",
    "next we show that interlayer coupling can lead to bilayer splitting of the areas of the electron pockets leaving the hole pockets essentially untouched .",
    "the subtleties of this result are discussed in some depth .",
    "iv contains a calculation of the self energy of the quasiparticles in the mixed state patterned after the work of stephen ,  @xcite which we find to be by far the soundest approach , despite its deficiencies .",
    "the calculation for the nodal quasiparticles of ddw is a little subtle and leads to a vortex contribution of the scattering rate that we find very reasonable .",
    "if this calculation can be better controlled , it may be possible to distinguish between the sdw and the ddw scenarios . given the approximate nature of this calculation , which can only yield a semiquantitative estimate , it seemed sufficient to illustrate our calculation with the commensurate case .",
    "of course , the vortex contribution to the scattering rate is only a part of the total that also contains an impurity contribution . in the concluding section , sec .",
    "v , we discuss our thoughts on microscopic models and whether or not incommensuration does actually occur .",
    "we also elaborate on experimental consequences of our work and point out the unresolved issues and future directions of research .",
    "before addressing the ic - ddw order parameter , let us summarize some of the features of the commensurate case .",
    "@xcite a commensurate singlet particle - hole condensate is defined by the order parameter @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "although the right hand side should correctly contain a factor @xmath13 , we will choose @xmath14 for clarity , as no confusion should arise .",
    "the electron destruction operator , @xmath15 , is indexed by the wave vector @xmath16 and spin @xmath17 ; @xmath3 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we say that the order is commensurate , or strictly @xmath18-fold commensurate , because @xmath19 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the form factor @xmath20 transforms non - trivially under the point group of the two dimensional square lattice , defined by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a set of integers positive or negative .",
    "it is related to the orbital angular momentum of the condensate . for ddw , @xmath23 which corresponds to angular momentum @xmath24 and @xmath25 symmetry . for a particle - hole condensate",
    ", the symmetry of the orbital wave function does not constrain the spin wave function . thus",
    ", there can also be a triplet ddw which corresponds to circulating staggered spin currents ,  @xcite as opposed to charge currents .",
    "if we set @xmath26 by a function that transforms as the identity and remove the factor @xmath27 , the order parameter would correspond to the conventional cdw .",
    "similarly , the triplet ddw is the @xmath28 generalization of the conventional spin density wave ( sdw ) and is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 s represent the pauli matrices , and @xmath31 is a unit vector in the spin space .",
    "once again , if we replace @xmath14 by unity , this order parameter is the conventional sdw .    because @xmath32 is real , the order in eq .",
    "breaks time - reversal and hence represents a state with non - zero orbital current configuration .",
    "this is most easily seen in real space , where eq .",
    "can be written as ( the spin indices @xmath17 suppressed for clarity ) : @xmath33 the @xmath0-wave hopping amplitude factor @xmath34 is @xmath35 and also represents a current - conserving vertex centered at @xmath36 as in fig.[fig:6vert ] ( a ) .",

    "this analogy motivated a 6-vertex description of the transition to a commensurate ddw state ,  @xcite where in addition to the @xmath0-wave vertices in fig .",
    "[ fig:6vert ] ( a)-(b ) one considers the effects of the @xmath37-wave vertices in fig .",
    "[ fig:6vert ] ( c)-(f ) .",
    "@xcite such a description was shown to have a finite temperature phase transition without any specific heat anomaly . as it will become evident below",
    ", one would have to include additional vertices to describe the transition to a bond - incommensurate ddw state .      to obtain an incommensurate version of ddw order ,",
    "one first notes that since it breaks the z@xmath38 time - reversal symmetry , one can construct antiphase - domain walls of mutually reversed current configurations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : domainbond ] ( a ) we have an example of a bond - oriented domain wall .",
    "it can be written as , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an overall antiphase modulation .",
    "the additional vertices @xmath41 in eq .   are necessary to ensure current conservation along the domain wall boundary where the current is _ half _ of that in the bulk .",
    "explicitly , they are given by the following : @xmath42 and where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : domainbond ] ( b ) .",
    "note that the vertices in eqs .   violate both @xmath0-wave and @xmath37-wave symmetries and hence a transition to bond ic - ddw order will not be in the universality class of the 6-vertex model .",
    "on the other hand , a diagonal domain wall , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : domaindiag ] , does not require extra vertices , and hence the transition to diagonal ic - ddw does belong to the 6-vertex model universality class .",
    ".,height=288 ]    because the contribution of @xmath41 is important only near a sharp bond - domain wall boundary , we drop it from now on .",
    "we will shortly see that at least in the single harmonic approximation , this is justified , for it leads to current conservation up to quadratic order in the inverse domain wall spacing .",
    "specifically , we can consider an array of antiphase - domain walls at positions @xmath45 .",
    "because the array is periodic , we can focus on the region @xmath46 , where due to the two domains at @xmath47 the antiphase modulation @xmath48 in is replaced by : @xmath49 with @xmath50 .    dropping the short range conributions @xmath41 and keeping the first harmonic  @xcite @xmath51 in eq",

    "note that we regain the commensurate case of eq .",
    "as @xmath54 since all domains are pushed to infinity in this limit . with the expression in eq .",
    "we can therefore analyze a continuous transition to an ic state .",
    "it remains to check that the boundary contributions @xmath41 are unimportant , by verifying that current is conserved at each site to quadratic order in @xmath55 .",

    "moreover , because ddw is odd with respect to rotations by @xmath62 and transpositions about the @xmath63 direction one can check that in addition to domain walls , a _ checkerboard pattern _ results from the following momentum - space representation : @xmath64 -\\left [ { \\bf q}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{o}({\\bf q } ) \\right]\\ ] ] where the operation @xmath65 can be either a transposition , or a rotaion by @xmath62 .",
    "physically , the checkerboard pattern in eq .   corresponds to simply superimposing two domain walls rotated by @xmath62 with respect to each other . in deriving eq .   we have considered bond - oriented domains , but the construction is easily generalizable for the diagonal domain walls in fig .

    "@xcite this ambiguity is understandable because the precise results are not known , either empirically or theoretically , especially in the underdoped regime .",
    "a more serious problem is to correctly reconcile the picture of the fermi surface emerging from the quantum oscillation observations with the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "@xcite finally , we will have to choose a chemical potential , @xmath72 , to attain the carrier concentration we desire , and this we will mostly take to be about @xmath73 of holes , simply because many quantum oscillation experiments are available for this doping level .",
    "however , we will comment on what our theory yields as the the doping increases or decreases .      in this subsection",

    "fig : c ] .",
    "are essentially unsplit by the bilayer coupling , in contrast , the electron pockets centered at @xmath85 and symmetry related points are split as described in the text.,width=283 ]    the generalization to the incommensurate case is straightforward and has been discussed previously .",
    "@xcite here we do not pursue this further but turn to a number of important conceptual issues .    1 .",
    "the interlayer tunneling hamiltonian is real and can not lead to orbital currents flowing between the layers .",
    "this is actually quite fortunate because the ddw order parameters within the planes remain undistorted .",
    "the sole effect of the interlayer hamiltonian is to lead to linear superpositions of the independent quasiparticle states , which lead to a bilayer splitting , as in a generic two - state system .",
    "if we are to choose opposite phasing of the orbital currents of the two layers , and change the matrix to @xmath169 there is no bilayer splitting of the areas of the fermi pockets . on the other hand , the ground state energy , to a very high degree of precision ,",
    "is identical to the previous cases even though the spectra are changed .",
    "we suspect that this equality is exact but have not been able to prove it analytically .",
    "therefore , at the level of approximation discussed here , energetics do not allow us to choose between the alternatives and the correct phasing should be determined from experiments .",
    "we have argued that the interlayer tunneling hamiltonian is both real and bilinear and therefore does not result in a flow of current between the layers .",
    "the only way such currents can appear is if there are further four fermion terms connecting the two layers such as particle - hole or particle - particle pair hopping terms .",
    "this would allow us to form further condensates made out of the two layers and would seriously distort the planar ddw order parameter .",
    "this has apparently gone unnoticed in ref .  .",
    "the distortion of ddw order parameter must be thought through anew .",
    "there is a further important consideration that is worth spelling out carefully .",
    "one of us recently argued  @xcite that the first order interalyer tunneling can be traded by a second order hamiltonian in which virtual pair hopping of both particle - particle and particle - hole are present .",
    "the second order hamiltonian involves four fermi interactions from which appropriate condensates can be constructed .",
    "it was shown there that for such a hamiltonian antiferromagnetic arrangement of the orbital currents of the layers in a bilayer unit would be lower in energy than the ferromagnetic arrangement .",
    "there were two arguments behind this effective hamiltonian .",
    "the first consisted in noticing that the ddw quasiparticle spectra are substantially gapped at the antinodal points . alas , given the existence of electron pockets in the quantum oscillation experiments , this mechanism could not be operative because there is no longer any gap at the antinodal points .",
    "the second argument involved non - fermi liquid spectral function .",
    "one can easily see that with increased doping there would be fermi surface reconnections near optimal doping and the electron pockets will evaporate .",
    "but at such doping , close to the middle of the superconducting dome , there will be a quantum critical point and one can expect the non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "@xcite the systematics of the superconducting transition temperature of optimally doped homologous series can still be correctly given by the second order pair hopping terms .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the quantum oscillation frequencies remain unshifted from the normal state in the mixed state of a wide class of superconductors , although there is increased damping arising from vortices .",
    "@xcite we shall closely follow stephen  @xcite where this problem is solved for a conventional metal in the normal state and a @xmath8-wave superconductor with a gap @xmath170 .",
    "since the bogoliubov quasiparticles do not couple minimally to the gauge field , they do not form landau levels and clearly can not be the source of quantum oscillations .",
    "@xcite the quantum oscillations must then arise from normal quasiparticles . by solving the gorkov equations in the mixed state stephen arrived at a formula for the self energy , which for high landau levels , relevant for the present problem , is @xmath171 .",

    "the real part of the self - energy shifts the chemical potential and the landau level positions equally .",

    "the imaginary part of the self - energy leads to the following scattering rate @xmath174 where the filling fraction is @xmath175 and @xmath176 is the upper critical field .    to illustrate our main points",
    ", we shall treat the simpler commensurate case .",
    "the extension to the incommensurate case is straightforward .",
    "there are two cases to consider .",
    "the effective mass corresponding to the electron pocket within the commensurate ddw theory , obtained by expanding around @xmath85 , is given by @xmath177 note that @xmath178 does not enter in the leading order .",
    "assuming , @xmath145 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 , we get @xmath181 where we have used @xmath182 and @xmath183 for the purpose of illustration . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : emstar ] ) and the parameters given above , we find that @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the free electron mass .",
    "a more interesting situation arises for the hole pocket , which , to an excellent approximation , can be described by the nodal fermions of ddw . for the purpose of illustration , we choose again the commensurate case .",
    "the stephen formula has to be rederived for nodal fermions .",
    "if the fermi surface reconstruction is due to sdw , the excitations of both the electron and hole pockets can be approximated by the non - relativistic schrdinger equations with the appropriate effective masses and stephen s formula will apply without further modifications . as an aside , we note that for the spiral sdw given in ref .  , the effective masses corresponding to both electron and hole pockets are considerably smaller ( of the order of @xmath186 ) and do not seem to agree with the experimental results . similarly , the dingle factors for the spiral sdw are different from those of the ddw order simply because sdw is gapped everywhere and the excitations are given by non - relativistic fermions .",

    "we get @xmath255 despite the relativistic nodal fermionic character of the quasiparticles , the quantum oscillation formulas at zero temperature , using the method of ando ,  @xcite are formally identical to the non - relativistic case with appropriate redefinitions .",

    "a similar reduced hamiltonian for dsc has the coupling @xmath281 .",

    "correlated hopping terms naturally arise even from the one - band hubbard model away from half - filling , where their contribution can be computed in @xmath282 perturbation theory : @xmath283 at dopings @xmath284 , for @xmath285 , we would have @xmath286 , @xmath287 being the antiferromagnetic exchange constant . thus , not far away from half - filling , correlated hopping terms are certainly not negligible .",
    "preliminary calculations  @xcite at the hartree - fock level shows that it is difficult to make ddw incommensurate in the relevant underdoped regime .",
    "the physical reason is that ddw has nodes .",
    "our mean field results suggest that it costs less energy to dope holes by opening pockets around the nodes rather than by making ddw incommensurate , as long as there is sufficient density of states left at the antinodes to support commensurate ddw . to confirm the above intuition",
    ", we tested the effect of gapping the nodes by either introducing @xmath8-wave order or including a @xmath288 piece  @xcite to ddw .",
    "we could see that at finite chemical potential , the effect of increasing the nodal gap created by the extra order is to induce a first order transition to an incommensurate state when the nodal gap amplitude is larger than a critical value , of the order of the @xmath25 amplitude itself .",
    "of course hartree - fock approximation need not be the full answer because the notion of topological doping  @xcite in the context of stripe order can be equally operative in the present context , a point that requires careful further work .",
    "it is amusing to note that spiral sdw is also generically energetically unfavorable compared to collinear sdw in the weak coupling hartree - fock approximation , as was pointed out by overhauser .  @xcite the strong coupling analysis can in principle lead to spirals , but these calculations are difficult to justify .",
    "@xcite      if the assumption of incommensurate order is correct we would predict a number of interesting results . first , there should be four frequencies : the electron pocket should be split by the bilayer coupling , although this must be small because otherwise it would have been already resolved .",
    "this sets the bilayer splitting in the range of @xmath289 at the level of 10% doping . in the overdoped regime",
    "the experimentally observed bilayer splitting of @xmath290 is already known to be substantially smaller than the estimate from the electronic structure calculations , which is about @xmath291 .",
    "@xcite why bilayer splitting is so small compared to electronic structure calculations is an important theoretical question requiring attention . to satisfy luttinger sum rule",
    ", we not only predict a big hole pocket , but also a smaller hole pocket of frequency 250 t. although there is a very preliminary indication ,  @xcite it needs to be investigated in further measurements and may constitute a confirming evidence of either a spiral sdw or an incommensurate ddw .",
    "ic - ddw could in principle be observed in y - nmr measurements , as the fact that y atom is situated at a high symmetry point is no longer an issue .",
    "however , the magnetic field at this site arising from the ic - ddw currents may be too small to observe this splitting .",
    "the most dramatic prediction of ic - ddw is the non - reflection symmetric band structure in a given spin sector .",
    "a direct observation of such a band structure will be possible in a spin resolved arpes measurement .",
    "note that for spiral sdw up and down spins are mixed .",
    "neutron scattering intensities from such quasiparticle bands may not be sufficient to detect it .      on the theoretical side a firm grasp on the existence of ic - ddw",
    "is necessary .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper whose fundamental concern was to explore the phenomenological consequences of ic - ddw .",
    "as it stands , theory seems to favor the commensurate picture , although the predicted hole - pocket in the commensurate case is yet to be observed in quantum oscillation measurements .",
    "we expect that many of the experimental puzzles will be resolved in future experiments .",
    "it is of course desirable to go beyond hartree - fock to formulate a correct microscopic theory of ic - ddw . in particular , diagonal domain walls as a mechanism for incommensuration have not yet been explored .",
    "this seems necessary because it seems doubtful that the antiphase domain walls that result in higher order commensurability , be it from ddw or antiphase spin stripe , can explain the present experiments .",
    "similarly , a rigorous theory of spiral sdw is desirable . as to ic - ddw ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the approximation of retaining only the single harmonic and to formulate a theory that fully conserves currents at the vertices .",
    "the chief experimental puzzle appears to be the conflict of the picture of the fermi surface emerging from the quantum oscillations with the arpes measurements .",
    "@xcite although the hole pocket is not a major concern , because it has been argued that the back side of the hole pocket may not be visible because of the ddw coherence factors  @xcite and similar coherence factors in other forms of competing mechanism , the non - existence of the electron pockets is more of a concern . from our previous calculations it is easy to see that at least two sides of the electron pockets should survive the effects of the coherence factors .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the past arpes was able to detect both electron and hole pockets in electron doped cuprates .",
    "@xcite    although we do not believe that the observed negative hall coefficient , its magnitude , and its oscillations can arise merely from the vortices in the mixed state , because it is difficult in such a scenario to obtain multiple fermi pockets tightly constrained by the luttinger sum rule , but it would be interesting to explore further the oscillations of the the hall coefficient , in fact it seems almost imperative .    we have argued  @xcite previously that the ortho - ii potential of @xmath158 is not an important factor in the explanation of the oscillations in contrast to the discussion in ref .   .",
    "the highly polarizable bao - layers next to the chains should screen the potentials quite effectively , to the extent that even disordered chains appear to have little effect in the planar physics in many properties .",
    "it is important to recognize that sdh , and dhva ,  @xcite measurements are also available in @xmath292 ( @xmath293 doping  @xcite ) , a stoichiometric compound with intrinsic oxygen order , where even the negative hall coefficient is clearly observed , in agreement with the observations in ortho - ii materials .  @xcite this degree of universality is unachievable if the chain potentials were playing an important role .",
    "a number of competing mechanisms  @xcite to explain these unusual experiments have been proposed and have been discussed in a previous work by one of us .",
    "@xcite thus , there is no need to duplicate the discussion here , but the salient questions that must be explained are worth repeating here .",
    "are the oscillations , the negative sign , and the magnitude of the hall coefficient explainable without invoking a two - band scenario of a hole pocket and an electron pocket ? can the experimentally observed frequencies and the luttinger sum rule be correctly reproduced ?",
    "if the spiral spin density wave order or the antiphase ic - ddw order is the explanation what would be the defining experimental predictions that could be tested in further experiments ? if the quasipartcles of a fermi liquid are truly responsible for the oscillation measurements , what is the role of mott physics in the cuprates ?",
    "the lack of any definitive measurements vindicating the static order parameters necessary to explain fermi surface reconstruction ( recall that dhva is an equilibrium effect ) is worth exploring . a magnetic field even as large as 60 t is not sufficient to provide enough perturbation to energetically nucleate static order in ybco with an order parameter large enough to reproduce the measurements , especially in @xmath292 with about @xmath294 doping .",
    "we hope that as other cuprates are explored and the theoretical tools are sharpened , many of these questions will be answered and will provide a resolution of the enigma of high-@xmath295 .    we thank reza jamei and eugene pivovarov for helpful discussions .",
    "we also acknowledge useful correspondence with our experimental colleagues : louis taillefer , cyril proust , s. sebastian , nigel hussey , and neil harrison .",
    "special thanks are also due to chetan nayak , bob laughlin , hae - young kee , steve kivelson and elihu abrahams for a seemingly unending constructive dialogs .",
