    "the falicov - kimball model is perhaps the simplest model to study correlation in fermionic systems on a lattice .",
    "it involves a conduction @xmath3-band , a localized @xmath1-electron state and an on - site coulomb interaction @xmath4 between the @xmath3 and @xmath1-electrons . since its introduction@xcite in 1959 , to describe valence or metal - insulator transition in some transition metal oxides , the model has been used successfully in describing various many - body effects  @xcite like metal - insulator transition , @xcite mixed - valence phenomena,@xcite the formation of ionic crystals @xcite and orbital @xcite and charge - density waves ( cdw ) .",
    "@xcite it was found @xcite that on a bipartite lattice at half - filling @xmath5 , @xmath6-electrons occupy sites of one sublattice only , the well - known checkerboard phase . for @xmath7 dimension",
    ", the chessboard charge pattern exists below a critical temperature , @xmath8 , above which a disordered phase is obtained .",
    "@xcite further , using dynamical mean field theory ( dmft),@xcite exact in dimension @xmath9 , brandt and mielsch confirmed the existence of inhomogeneous cdw phase.@xcite an extended version of falicov - kimball model is also in use to account for the homogeneous mixed valence problem .",
    "it has been used since last two decades to account unconventional ferroelectricity @xcite in mixed - valent compounds .",
    "customarily , ferroelectricity appears due to the structural phase transition .",
    "however , it is also possible that there is a nonvanishing @xmath10 coherence in a system leading to a hybridization term of purely electronic origin",
    ". this coherence could give rise to electric polarization due to bose - einstein condensation of @xmath11 excitons when the two bands differ by odd parity .",
    "portengen and co - authors studied an extended fkm with a @xmath12-dependent hybridization term in hartree - fock approximation following leder s work .",
    "@xcite they found that the coulomb interaction @xmath13 between itinerant @xmath3-electron and localized @xmath1-electron gives rise to a nonvanishing @xmath11 coherence @xmath14 even in the limit of vanishing hybridization @xmath15 in the presence of a putative homogeneous ground state solution of the hf approximation . in the weak - coupling mean - field theory ,",
    "the formation of an order parameter and the condensation thereof are concomitant . quite interestingly , this condensation of the excitonic order parameter , they pointed out , signifies a `` spontaneous '' polarization in the system when the parities of the electron - hole partners in the condensate differ by one .",
    "later , czycholl @xcite showed that an imhomogeneous ground state , as obtains in fkm on a square lattice at half - filling , leads to @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the fkm in the half - filled limit does not admit a  spontaneous \" symmetry breaking , consistent ( but not contradictory at @xmath18 , where elitzur s theorem does not forbid an order ) with the local @xmath19 symmetry in the @xmath1-band at @xmath20 . for a small non - zero hybridization @xmath21 , the inhomogeneous ( cdw )",
    "phase is stable , and the order parameter is finite .",
    "this cdw phase , though , melts beyond a critical hybridization strength .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in a triangular lattice as well  @xcite . for a one - dimensional extended fkm , using exact - diagonalization and dmrg techniques , farkasovsk has ruled out the possibility of spontaneous excitonic averages at zero temperature @xcite , which is expected in one dimension . employing the same numerical technique , farkasovsk investigated the effects of local and non - local @xcite hybridization on valence transitions .",
    "zlati et al.@xcite confirmed that the static excitonic susceptibility diverges at @xmath18 in the ordinary fkm @xmath22 , from an exact solution of the model in infinite dimension . in dimensions",
    "@xmath23 , a finite @xmath1-electron bandwidth breaks the local @xmath19 symmetry and induce a non - zero polarization even in the absence of @xmath11 hybridization as expected from symmetry grounds .",
    "this is easily shown @xcite by mapping an extended fkm ( @xmath20 but @xmath24 finite ) on to a hubbard model with asymmetric hopping ( @xmath25 ) and thence to an effective anisotropic @xmath26 spin model with a  field \" along z - direction in the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "the intermediate coupling regime was treated with constrained path monte - carlo ( cpmc ) technique .",
    "a nonlocal hybridization in an extended fkm stabilizes excitonic averages with the inclusion of @xmath1-electron hopping.@xcite    ferroelectric materials have sustained a significant attention in condensed matter physics and have been an important component of modern applications and technology . in conventional ferroelectrics , ferroelectricity is connected with distortions of the lattice . in multiferroic materials",
    "this can be induced by magnetic field which has spawned a considerable interest owing to the tunability of the ferroelectric order through magnetic fields .",
    "the unconventional ferroelectricity arising out of @xmath10 coherence is , on the other hand , purely of electronic origin and offers an additional route to tuning optical properties with magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    a moot question is therefore what happens to such an excitonic condensate in the presence of a strong orbital field .",
    "this kind of gauge - field can be experimentally realized by using ultracold particles ( fermions and bosons ) on optical lattices.@xcite moreover , there are recent proposals for the realization of fkm in optical lattices with mixtures of light atoms in the correlated disordered environment formed by heavy atoms.@xcite therefore , it is quite pertinent to appraise an extended fkm in optical lattices in the presence of an artificial gauge field produced in the same lattice . in a very strong magnetic field ,",
    "the two zeeman - split bands are well separated in energy and at low filling , only the lower band is relevant , effectively reducing it to a spinless problem .",
    "the field then couples to the orbital degrees only via the canonical transformation .",
    "we implement a self - consistent mean - field calculation using exact diagonalization to study the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we first examine the case without a magnetic field and then study the effect of orbital field on the exciton condensation .",
    "results for both commensurate and incommensurate magnetic fluxes are obtained and discussed .",
    "we consider an extended fkm for spinless fermions on a square lattice represented by the hamiltonian @xmath27    where @xmath28 are nearest - neighbour site indices on a square lattice ( lattice parameter @xmath29 is chosen as length unit ) , @xmath30 are itinerant ( localized ) electron annihilation operators at site @xmath31 .",
    "the first term represents the kinetic energy of @xmath3-electrons while the second term represents on - site coulomb interaction between @xmath3-electrons of density @xmath32 and the @xmath1-electrons with density @xmath33 ) ; @xmath34 being the number of sites .",
    "the third term @xmath35 represents the non - dispersive @xmath1-electron energy level .",
    "the fourth term stands for the hybridization between @xmath36 and @xmath6 electrons .",
    "we consider a model system with a @xmath36 band and @xmath6 level arising from @xmath36 and @xmath6 orbitals on every site .",
    "we set the hopping integral @xmath37 to be @xmath38 throughout the calculation and all other energy parameters are defined in units of @xmath37 . in the absence of the hybridization term , the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath39 , in which case @xmath40 is a good quantum number . in this case , the hamiltonian is exactly solvable in infinite dimension . by annealing over @xmath1-electron distributions in the lattice ,",
    "it can be ` solved ' numerically as well .",
    "the hybridization term @xmath41 removes the local @xmath19 symmetry associated with the conservation of @xmath40 and the hamiltonian is no longer exactly solvable , albeit in the above sense .",
    "we , therefore , take recourse to the usual hartree - fock self - consistent mean - field approximation to obtain the excitonic order parameter @xmath42 .    in presence of a magnetic field , the spinless , mobile fermions ` see ' the field via the usual canonically conjugate momentum .",
    "on a lattice problem as at hand , the nearest - neighbour hopping term is therefore modified by a peierls phase@xcite factor . with the choice of landau gauge @xmath43 for a uniform magnetic field @xmath44 perpendicular to the plane of the lattice , the hopping integral",
    "@xmath45 remains unchanged along the @xmath46-direction while @xmath47=@xmath48 = @xmath49 along the @xmath50-direction . here",
    "@xmath51=@xmath52 is the number of flux quanta per plaquette of a square lattice .",
    "this represents the gain of phase by an electron hopping round a closed path along the plaquette . throughout our calculation",
    ", we consider only rational magnetic flux , i.e. @xmath53 with @xmath54 co - prime integers and @xmath55 is the dirac flux quantum . under the application of lattice translational operator , which moves @xmath56 number of lattice points along x - direction ,",
    "the hamiltonian remains invariant .",
    "once the magnetic field is switched on , lattice periodicity is lost along @xmath46-direction . due to the peierls phases ,",
    "hamiltonian is not invariant to all lattice translations , only to those in the magnetic translation group .",
    "@xcite this group is associated with a magnetic unit cell @xmath57 times larger than the original unit cell , so as to enclose an integer flux @xmath58 . however , since it is only a phase , repeating at every @xmath59 , periodicity is still retained , albeit with a different value . therefore , to accommodate a magnetic flux @xmath60=@xmath61",
    ", the resultant magnetic supercell will be a strip of length @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite we chose a typical supercell of size @xmath63 throughout the calculation .",
    "for the convergence criterion , we set the difference between the values of the order parameters for two consecutive iterations to within @xmath64 .",
    "the energy spectrum , in the non - interacting limit , is well - known and shows interesting structure : a self - similar structure in which the widths and gaps depend critically on the values of the magnetic flux .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we work with rational magnetic fields : in the non - interacting limit an irrational field induces a cantor set .",
    "to check our numerical procedure we start with the extended fkm @xmath65 in the symmetric case ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) without the transverse field .",
    "we study the effect of coulomb interaction on the stability of excitons .",
    "the calculation shows there is no finite excitonic average in the @xmath68 limit as expected on symmetry grounds .",
    "@xcite as we increase hybridization between @xmath69 and @xmath70 electrons for a fixed coulomb correlation , we find an enhancement in the excitonic order parameter .",
    "moreover , to see the effect of coulomb interaction , we have chosen three different values of @xmath4 .",
    "it is evident from fig.1 .",
    "that for finite @xmath71 , there is a nonvanishing @xmath72 that is strongly enhanced as @xmath4 increases .",
    "the effect of @xmath4 is stronger , smaller the value of @xmath71 : the order parameter is exponentially enhanced as expected .",
    "these results are in complete agreement with previous results in a wide parameter regime .",
    "@xcite    the effect of orbital magnetic field on the evolution of excitons is a question we address next . with the inclusion of special flux values @xmath73 per plaquette in a square lattice , the hopping term is modified by a phase and it affects the exciton formation via interference and localization effects , as seen elsewhere as well .",
    "@xcite as we see from fig.2 , the excitonic average is suppressed with the application of field . as it is clear from fig.2(a ) , a prominent peak at @xmath74 and a dip at @xmath75 can be found for @xmath76 case .",
    "there is a large peak at @xmath77 ; signifying the maximum value at which @xmath72 is minimum and this is the case for all the values of @xmath13 studied .",
    "these undulations become lesser with larger @xmath13 and @xmath21 ( see inset to fig .",
    "the low @xmath13 and low @xmath21 regimes more or less follow the non - interacting physics and display a typical hofstadter characteristics . as the hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to @xmath51 and @xmath78 ,",
    "fig.2 is symmetric with respect to @xmath79 the variation of @xmath72 with @xmath21 more or less follows the same pattern as in the absence of magnetic field ( see fig.3(a ) ) .",
    "however , for a fixed @xmath4 , the excitonic average reduces with increase in magnetic filed .",
    "it is also possible to get an enhancement in the excitonic average in a region where hybridization and correlation effects are quite weak ( see fig.3(b ) ) .",
    "so far , the @xmath1-electrons are kept localized without hopping .",
    "we now allow delocalization of the @xmath1-electrons with a dispersive term @xmath80 in the hamiltonian .",
    "it is known that the @xmath1-electron hopping itself can give rise to non - zero ferroelectricity without the presence of explicit hybridization in the hamiltonian in @xmath81 dimension .",
    "@xcite we therefore examine the effect of @xmath1-electron hopping on the excitonic average .",
    "the magnitude as well as sign of @xmath1-electron hopping integral @xmath24 play important roles in the formation of an exciton .",
    "the value of excitonic order parameter is found to decrease with an increase in @xmath24 ; this is an effect of the enhanced kinetic energy of the @xmath1-electrons destabilizing the local excitonic order parameter .",
    "the same problem is then studied in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath82 .",
    "fig.4(c ) shows that the excitonic condensation is further suppressed with @xmath83 , increasing the kinetic energy of the @xmath1-electrons .",
    "as seen from fig.4 , for a fixed value of @xmath4 , @xmath72 drops with an increase in @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , this is expected as the @xmath1-electron occupancy at a site is lower now as compared to the case when it was occupied by a localized @xmath1-electron .    in the presence of the magnetic field",
    ", there is serious commensurability effect on the excitonic order parameter . with chosen values of @xmath10 correlation and hybridization terms ,",
    "the system is essentially in the homogeneous ground state .",
    "as seen from fig.5 , for some magnetic flux values , the magnetic unit cell is commensurate with the lattice size ( in the present study on a 24 @xmath84 24 lattice , @xmath85 and so on represent commensurate fluxes ) and the excitonic average is uniform throughout the lattice . with increase in the commensurate flux values , magnitude of @xmath72 decreases and",
    "the order parameter is uniform . on the other hand ,",
    "the order parameter varies in a quite different way when the magnetic flux is incommensurate . in this case",
    ", the order parameter exhibits a one - dimensional modulation and the modulation length changes with the flux ( fig.5(b ) , ( c ) ) .",
    "in the foregoing we have studied excitons in a transverse magnetic field numerically from an extended , spinless 2d lattice model , namely , the falicov kimball model .",
    "the fkm in presence of a hybridization term generally supports quantum mixed valence and an excitonic condensation of particle - hole bound states . in the presence of an orbital field ,",
    "the itinerant electrons pick up a phase while the localized ones do not , and the excitonic condensate is expected to be affected asymetrically .",
    "this competition between the applied magnetic field and coulomb correlations leads to interesting physics .",
    "the interband coulomb interaction exponentially enhances the excitonic average .",
    "when the periodicity of the magnetic flux is commensurate with the lattice , the excitonic condensation is homogeneous throughout real space , whereas a one - dimensional modulation of order parameter is observed for incommensurate flux periodicity .",
    "the orbital magnetic field has a localizing effect on mobile @xmath3-electrons , affecting the excitonic coherence ; a drop in the value of excitonic order parameter with both commensurate and incommensurate flux results . with non - zero @xmath1-electron hopping , further reduction in the excitonic averages",
    "is observed .",
    "the orbital field opposes the formation of an exciton as the kinetic energy of participating particles becomes larger than the condensation energy . in the small hybridization limit",
    "however , there is a different role of orbital field favouring the formation of an exciton at a special value @xmath86 per plaquette , thereby opening the possibility of tuning ferro - electricity via magnetic field .",
