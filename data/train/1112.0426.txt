    "the fast coherent movement of flocking birds is a fascinating phenomenon exhibiting apparent intelligence and coordination @xcite .",
    "new monitoring technologies have meant that this collective behavior has recently attracted renewed interest from scientific and engineering communities , allowing more conclusive analysis to be performed @xcite .",
    "it is a valuable topic whether all members of a flock contribute equally to the collective decision making and follow equivalent rules , or certain individuals have a greater influence on the decisions of the group @xcite .",
    "the proposition that all contribute equally is sometimes referred to as the  many wrongs \" principle , and purports that individuals average their preferred directions depending on interaction with their neighbors , leading to a compromise in route choice @xcite .",
    "conversely , the leadership hypothesis posits that one or a small number of leaders are able to exert a disproportionate influence on the group s movement decisions @xcite .",
    "both theoretical and experimental arguments predict that the compromise of all members will make more accurate decisions than the leading of one or a small number individuals , unless leaders have very different and superior information @xcite . for example",
    ", homing performance of the pre - trained pigeons flying as a flock is significantly better than that of these birds released individually @xcite .",
    "yet , recent research has shown that time - varying hierarchical decision making mechanisms do exist during pigeon flights @xcite  giving strength to the leadership hypothesis .",
    "although new studies show that certain individuals in pigeon flocks are able to exert relatively more influence on the movement decisions of the whole group , only the directed relationship ( pointing from the leader to the follower ) has been studied @xcite .",
    "in addition to such directed links ( representing a leader - follower relationship ) selective coordinated behavior may also exist in collective motion , hence mutual relationships must also be examined .",
    "for example , in the case of a perturbation caused by the terrain or a predator , the better strategy for birds would probably be to share the information of all group members to move rapidly to safety regardless of their individual positions within a leadership hierarchy .",
    "such mutual links represent a reciprocal relationship between a pair of pigeons , which appears nonrandomly in real - life directed networks @xcite and plays a significant role in the evolution of many biological systems @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the coexistence of compromise and leadership is not a contradiction , but a meaningful supplement to the hierarchical structure of pigeon flocks .",
    "the main difference between the work in @xcite and ours is as follows : they are concentrating on the leadership aspect ; while we are focusing on local interactions ( including both directed and reciprocal relationships ) .",
    "in this paper , we re - analyze experimental high - precision datasets of pigeon flocks to arrive at a more nuanced conclusion about the interactions and decisions in the collective dynamics of birds . using quantitative methods from statistical physics @xcite , we find that both outcomes ( directed and mutual links ) coexist in the same flock flights .",
    "the mutual links represent a reciprocal relationship between individuals , which is a useful supplement to the well - defined hierarchical structure . integrating both directed and reciprocal links we uncover the complete topology of the network induced by the collective motion of a pigeon flock .",
    "most significantly , our results imply that there is an integrated mechanism of decision - making in pigeon flocks : neither a leadership nor a compromise mechanism is clearly dominant , rather both mechanisms coexist .",
    "in the past tens of years , it is a very difficult mission to explore the influence of individual members on a fast collective motion at all times .",
    "recently , the advance of gps devices allow us to use sophisticated evaluation techniques to mine real flocking data @xcite . employing high - precision gps in tracking pairs of pigeons , biro _",
    "find that two birds compromise if they have less diversity on directional preferences , while either the pair split or one of them becomes the leader for a severe conflict @xcite .",

    "show a well - defined hierarchy among pigeons belonging to the same flock @xcite . in this study",
    ", we use the same datasets : @xmath0 free flights and @xmath1 homing flights .",
    "more detailed information on the datasets can be obtained from the website : http://hal.elte.hu / pigeonflocks/.    to investigate the influence that a given bird s behavior has on the other flock members , the temporal relationship between the flight directions has been evaluated @xcite .",
    "the directional correlation for a pair of pigeons is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes time average and @xmath4 is the normalized velocity of bird @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 obtains its maximum value at the time delay @xmath7 , @xmath7 is called the optimal directional delay time .",
    "negative @xmath7 values mean that the @xmath5th bird falls behind the @xmath8th bird , which can thus be interpreted as a case of @xmath8 leading . for each pair ,",
    "we extract the positive value @xmath9 as a directed edge pointing from the leader to the follower .",
    "if individuals fly together in a flock , they will show a very similar velocity and a high correlation @xcite . in a previous study",
    ", the authors study the leader - follower relationship among pairs of pigeons whose directional correlation time delay is non - zero , and such links are directed @xcite .",
    "the directed link indicates that a following bird tends to consistently copy the directional behavior of particular leading individuals .",
    "however , the directional correlation time delay may be near zero , which means a pair of pigeons have a coordinated interaction with one another and there is a mutual ( reciprocal ) link between them .",
    "the frequency distribution of the directional correlation time delay for pairwise pigeons in all collective motions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_histogram ] . here",
    "we select @xmath10 s as the time interval of time delay , for the sampling time interval of the original dataset and the resolution of time delay in the previous study @xcite both are @xmath10 s. the frequency of @xmath11 is the most frequent , meaning that there are typically many mutual relationships between the pairwise birds in pigeon flocks .",
    "moreover , the result also implies that the perfect hierarchical structure induced by directed links in @xcite may not be adequate to completely explain the collective behavior of pigeon flocks .     between each pair of pigeons in all the flights .",
    "when the correlation coefficient reaches the maximum value @xmath6 at the time delay @xmath7 , @xmath7 is called the directional correlation delay time and @xmath6 is called the maximum correlation coefficient . here",
    "we only consider the conditions of @xmath12 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    here we hope to explain why a correlation that decays from @xmath11 represents a `` mutual link '' instead of no interaction in our study .",
    "actually , in some cases of collective motions , a decaying temporal correlation that is maximal at zero lag is an evidence that there is no interaction .",
    "for example , katz and collaborators showed that the orientation correlation whose peak at zero time delay is significantly lower than the orientation correlation whose peak after zero [ fig .",
    "s8a in  @xcite ] . on the contrary , in our study",
    "@xmath6 at @xmath11 tends to be higher than the values at the large time delay [ fig .",
    "[ fig2_cij ] ] , which means the strength of mutual links is stronger than that of directed links .     decrease with @xmath13 for all the ( a ) free flights and ( b ) homing flights .",
    "the solid circles ( squares ) show the mean of @xmath6 while the bars show the standard deviation of @xmath6.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    furthermore , we use multiple effective methods ( @xmath6 , motif , synchronization and multiscale analysis ) to prove the existence of reciprocal interaction as follows .",
    "the values of the maximum correlation coefficient @xmath6 at the directional correlation time delay @xmath7 have been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2_cij ] .",
    "the birds movements under two conditions , free flights and homing flights , are recorded  @xcite .",
    "the pigeon flock makes a circle - like route in free flights ; while the group makes less direction turning during homing flights [ fig .",
    "s6 in @xcite ] . because of the more centralized distribution of turning directions in homing flights , it is easier to obtain a larger @xmath6 , which results in the values of @xmath6 at the same @xmath7 in homing flights [ fig .",
    "[ fig2_cij](b ) ] being larger than those in free flights [ fig .",
    "[ fig2_cij](a ) ] . in both cases",
    ", we can find that @xmath6 at the small @xmath7 tends to be higher than the values at the large time delay .",
    "moreover , when the time delay is zero , the value of @xmath6 is the highest , which implies that these mutual links are the most important relationship in the flock and more attention should be paid to such types of links .",
    "although interaction and correlation are different and their relationship has been extensively discussed @xcite , using the method of calculating pairwise correlation @xcite , it is still difficult to determine whether the relationship between a pair of pigeons is a direct interaction or an indirect correlation .",
    "here we develop a simple method to detect whether three links in a small subgraph ( motif ) are independent .",
    "a motif , defined as a small connected subgraph that recurs in a graph , is the basic functional unit of complex networks @xcite .",
    "a small motif with three nodes in the network induced from each flight are shown in table  [ table_motif ] .",
    ".comparison of the values of the maximum correlation coefficient for the three links in the subgraph ( motif ) structure .",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the maximum correlation coefficients for the three links , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is the whole number of the subgraph in all the flights .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table_all ]",
    "our study indicates the balance between compromise and leadership for the organized flight of pigeons .",
    "reciprocal links represent a mutual correlation between a pair of individuals .",
    "note that our result is not contradictory to the previous conclusion that there is a hierarchical structure in pigeon flocks @xcite , instead it is a meaningful supplement .",
    "our results show that the many wrongs and leadership mechanism can coexist in a collective motion .",
    "hence , the dichotomy between these two mechanisms is false , at least for the flocking flight of pigeons .",
    "our work also has significant meaning for modeling the collective motion of animals .",
    "if a pigeon flock only has a hierarchical structure , it means that the local interaction mechanism of previous models @xcite may not be adequate for simulating the group flights of homing pigeons ( lacking the leadership ) , despite the interaction rule being dependent on the metric distance @xcite or the topological distance @xcite .",
    "however , our work suggests that the local interaction relationships ( including directed and mutual links ) are sufficient to characterize cohesive motion of pigeon flocks .",
    "our results are helpful to provide a comprehensive picture of collective dynamic behavior in animal group movement and unify both the interaction mechanisms observed in experimental data and theoretical models of coherent behavior .",
    "we hypothesize that the integrated mechanism between compromise and leadership also brings more advantage to both the individuals and the whole system , to cope with external perturbations ( e.g. , predatory threat and food source ) .",
    "individuals of the same species come together to form a group because a compact flock has more advantages to react to environmental perturbations than separate individuals @xcite .",
    "any external perturbation for flocking movement is likely to directly cause a change of velocity ( direction , magnitude , or both ) for a small subset of birds that first detect the perturbation .",
    "such localized changes can be transmitted to the whole flock to produce a collective response as if being of one mind @xcite , making the whole group both very flexible and responsive .",
    "conversely , if there were only a hierarchical structure in pigeon flocks , the followers can not transmit any external signals to the leaders , so the whole group is not so sensitive to environmental perturbations .",
    "the sensitivity of the whole group can evolve and strengthen if the group members have a local interaction mechanism among them @xcite . in particular , reciprocal links allow individuals to interact with their neighbors and supply a useful way for the followers to convey information to the leaders .",
    "it needs to be noted that calculating pairwise correlation and even the methods in @xcite can be regarded as dividing a large - scale complex system ( such as a fish school @xcite ) into multiple local sub - systems ( a pair of subjects ) .",
    "it is difficult to accurately determine how one individual is simultaneously affected by others ( more than one individual ) , because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts @xcite .",
    "an extension of this method based on the holism of complex systems @xcite for analyzing these trajectory data should be developed in future .",
