    "although there are loads of works about the chaoticity of orbital motions in different galactic potentials ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* citing but a handful ) , few of them focused in the motion on the meridional plane of an axially symmetric potential .",
    "the study of this kind of motion can be traced back to the works of @xcite and @xcite . while @xcite have studied resonant ( regular ) meridional plane orbits , and @xcite considered , as was common in those days , that almost any orbit in an axially symmetric potential should obey a third isolating integral of motion besides the angular momentum and the energy",
    ", @xcite claimed that the motion of stars in the meridional plane was one of the standing problems in galactic dynamics where integrability and stochasticity play a role .",
    "however , few contributions to this problem have arised so far .",
    "@xcite insisted in the lines of @xcite , ignoring the chaoticity , while @xcite found chaotic motion but only when their galactic model was perturbed .",
    "@xcite have also built orbits in the meridional plane , but , again , they focused in regular solutions claiming that most stars move on regular orbits . in the same line ,",
    "@xcite have also studied orbits in the meridional plane but their scope was specifically to treat regular orbits .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , have studied chaotic motion in a two - dimensional logarithmic potential as representative of the meridional plane potential of an elliptical galaxy with a dense bulge , although it lacks the necessary centrifugal term .",
    "@xcite , in a thorough study , analyzed the orbital content in the coordinate planes of triaxial potentials and in the meridional plane of axially symmetric potentials , but focusing , again , on the regular families .",
    "the chaotic motion in the meridional plane of axially symmetric galaxies , therefore , is still an open problem , and we will conduct here an investigation of this topic .    knowing whether the orbits of a dynamical system are ordered or chaotic is a first step towards the understanding of the overall behavior of the system .",
    "but also of particular interest is the distribution of regular orbits into different families .",
    "@xcite proposed a technique , dubbed spectral dynamics , for this particular purpose . later on this method has been extended and improved by @xcite and @xcite . in general terms",
    ", this method computes the fourier transform of the coordinates of an orbit , identifies its peaks , extracts the corresponding frequencies , and search for the fundamental frequencies and their possible resonances . in the present work , we shall use a similar technique in order to classify regular orbits into different families .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ galmod ] we present our gravitational galactic model . in section [ commet ]",
    "we describe the computational methods we used in order to explore the nature of orbits . in the following section ,",
    "we investigate how the basic parameters of the system influences the character of the orbits . in section [ anres ]",
    "we present some heuristic arguments , in order to support and explain the numerically obtained outcomes of the previous section .",
    "we conclude with section [ discus ] , where the discussion and the conclusions of this research are presented .",
    "in the present work , we shall investigate the character of the motion in the meridional plane of an axially symmetric disk galaxy with a spherical nucleus .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the axis of symmetry .",
    "the total potential @xmath2 in our model is the sum of a disk potential @xmath3 and a central spherical component @xmath4 .",
    "the first one is represented by a miyamoto - nagai potential @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the mass of the disk , @xmath8 is the scale length of the disk , and @xmath9 corresponds to the disk s scale height . for the description of the spherically symmetric nucleus we use a plummer potential ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass and the scale length of the nucleus , respectively .",
    "this potential has been used in the past to model the central mass component of a galaxy ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we must point out that the nucleus is not intended to represent a black hole nor any other compact object , but a bulge ; therefore , we do nt include relativistic effects .",
    "we use a system of galactic units where the unit of length is 1 kpc , the unit of velocity is 10 km s@xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the unit of mass results @xmath15 , that of time is @xmath16 a , the unit of angular momentum ( per unit mass ) is 10 km kpc s@xmath13 , and the unit of energy ( per unit mass ) is 100 km@xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "we use throughout the paper the values @xmath19 ( corresponding to @xmath20 m@xmath21 , i.e. , a normal disc galaxy mass ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these last values were chosen having in mind a milky way - type galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mass and the scale length of the nucleus , on the other hand , are treated as parameters .",
    "one important physical quantity in disk galaxies is the circular velocity in the plane @xmath24 , @xmath25 replacing with our potential we obtain @xmath26    a plot of @xmath27 for our galactic model with @xmath28 and @xmath29 is presented in fig .",
    "[ rotvel ] , as a black curve . in the same plot ,",
    "the red line shows the contribution from the spherical nucleus , while the blue curve is the contribution from the disk .",
    "it is seen that at small distances from the galactic center , @xmath30 kpc , the contribution from the spherical nucleus dominates , while at larger distances , @xmath31 kpc , the disk contribution is the dominant factor .",
    "we also observe the characteristic local minimum of the rotation curve which appears when fitting observed data to a galactic model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the total potential @xmath2 is axisymmetric , the @xmath1-component of the angular momentum @xmath32 is conserved . with this restriction ,",
    "orbits can be described by means of the effective potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath33 the @xmath34 term represents a centrifugal barrier ; only orbits with small @xmath32 are allowed to pass near the axis of symmetry .",
    "the 3d motion is thus effectively reduced to a 2d motion in the meridional plane @xmath35 , which rotates non - uniformly around the axis of symmetry according to @xmath36 where the dot indicates derivative with respect to time .",
    "the equations of motion on the meridional plane are @xmath37    the equations governing the evolution of a deviation vector @xmath38 which joins the corresponding phase space points of two initially nearby orbits , needed for the calculation of the standard indicators of chaos , are given by the variational equations @xmath39    the corresponding hamiltonian to the effective potential given in eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the numerical value of the hamiltonian , which is conserved .",
    "therefore , an orbit is restricted to the area in the meridional plane satisfying @xmath42 .",
    "in order to study the chaoticity of our models , we chose , for each set of values of the parameters of the potential , a grid of initial conditions in the @xmath43 plane , regularly distributed in the area allowed by the value of the energy .",
    "the points of the grid were separated 0.1 units in @xmath44 and 0.5 units in @xmath45 . for each initial condition",
    ", we integrated the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) with a double precision bulirsch - stoer algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "each orbit was integrated for @xmath46 time units , which corresponds to a time span of the order of hundreds of orbital periods . in all cases , the energy integral ( eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) ) was conserved better than one part in @xmath47 , although for most orbits it was better than one part in @xmath48 .    for our study",
    ", we want to know whether each orbit is regular or chaotic .",
    "several indicators of chaos are available in the literature ; we chose two of them , namely the standard lyapunov exponents ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sali indicator @xcite .",
    "of course , being the lyapunov exponents defined for @xmath49 , only a finite time version of them ( lyapunov characteristic numbers ) are numerically achievable . to compute these indicators , we integrated , along with each orbit , its corresponding variational equations ( [ vareq ] ) from unitary displacements in each of the cartesian directions of the phase space @xmath50 of the meridional plane , thus allowing us to compute , along with the sali , the full set of lyapunov exponents using a gram - schmidt orthogonalization and a renormalization of the displacement vectors at each step , following the recipe of @xcite .    to classify an orbit as regular or chaotic by using either the maximal lyapunov characteristic number ( mlcn ) or the sali",
    ", a threshold value should be established separating both types of orbit .",
    "this is a delicate issue , as these thresholds are generally obtained by some statistical procedure or , even , by eye inspection of plots of the indicators versus time . besides , whereas the results of different chaos indicators agree in general , there are also  sticky \" orbits ( i.e. , chaotic orbits that behave as regular ones during long periods of time ) , that may be misclassified by one or another method depending of the threshold value used .    , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the blue lines show the resulting thresholds which separate regular from chaotic orbits .",
    "the three red dots indicate three orbits classified differently by both indicators . ]",
    "we established the thresholds by taking advantage of our computation of two chaos indicators , as follows .",
    "first , the set of orbits of a given grid was integrated , as we already said , for @xmath46 time units ( i.e. , about @xmath55 years , thus avoiding sticky orbits with a stickiness at least of the order of a hubble time ) .",
    "then , their mlcn and sali were computed , and we looked for those values of the thresholds that maximised the agreement in the classification of both methods . to this end , we iterated the values of the thresholds until a minimum of disagreement has been achieved , choosing as initial values the mean of each indicator .",
    "we found that the values thus computed leave less than 1% of orbits differently classified by both methods .",
    "[ lysa ] shows an example of the resulting thresholds .",
    "the horizontal and vertical lines correspond to the established threshold values .",
    "we can see three red dots , corresponding to orbits for which the classifications of both indicators did not coincide .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xcite also used a combination of mlcn and sali , although they supplemented those indicators by adding the computation of the variation with time of the fundamental frequencies of the orbits , and they did not combine the indicators to establish their thresholds . as a reference ,",
    "table [ tabla2 ] shows the values of the thresholds thus obtained for each of the models studied in section [ results ] , plus the number of orbits which did nt get the same classification .",

    "their mother orbit is a closed loop orbit .",
    "moreover , when the oscillations are in phase , the 1:1 orbit degenerates into a linear orbit ( the same as in lissajous figures made with two oscillators ) . in our meridional plane , however , 1:1 orbits do not have the shape of a loop .",

    "[ psssmn]a depicts the phase plane when @xmath62 . one can observe that most of the phase space is covered by regular orbits , while there are also several chaotic layers which separate the areas of regularity .",

    "once again , the meridional 2:1 bananas are immune to changes of the parameter .",
    "thus , decreasing the scale length of the nucleus turns box and high resonant orbits into chaotic orbits , while those with low resonances are less affected .",
    "@xcite showed , for an axially symmetric galactic model composed of a disk , a halo and a spherical nucleus , that one of the most important parameters that influences the orbital structure is the angular momentum @xmath32 . here , we let @xmath32 vary along the set @xmath71 , while fixing @xmath28 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "[ pssslz]a depicts the @xmath72 phase plane when @xmath73 .",

    "in fact , when @xmath78 , they are the dominant type of orbits .",

    "in particular , the percentage of 2:1 bananas is little affected by the increase of the angular momentum , unlike the previous cases .",
    "it is also seen that when @xmath79 the percentage of the 4:3 family drops suddenly , remaining at very low values from then on .",
    "summarizing , the angular momentum mostly affects box and chaotic orbits .",
    "to further investigate the influence of @xmath32 , we define , for each set of values of the parameters , the critical value of the angular momentum @xmath80 as the maximum value of the angular momentum for which the orbits can display chaotic motion . fig .",

    "as before , the 4:5 orbits remain unperturbed and with very low percentages",
    "in the literature , the dynamical origin of the onset of chaos has proven elusive so far . a promising line of investigation , namely the curvature of the phase space , although theoretically sound , came up against many experimental counterexamples ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "@xcite have shown that stars that pass near a density cusp , thus receiving a large acceleration , may depopulate the family of box orbits which supports the triaxial figure of a galaxy .",

    "but , the effective potential on the meridional plane _ does _ have a cusp at the origin , caused by the centrifugal term .",

    "we ve found exactly the same behaviour when using orbits from the rest of the cases analysed in section [ results ] .",
    "therefore , we may draw the following conclusion : in the meridional plane of our galactic model , _ a necessary condition for an orbit to be chaotic is to pass near the center of the potential ; a sufficient condition for an orbit to be regular is not to pass near the center of the potential_.    from the results of the previous section , all of the studied parameters , except the energy , have an almost monotonic influence on the percentage of chaos in the meridional plane .",

    "[ lzpercrit ] , left ) .",
    "we ve found ( numerically ) that in all the cases the position @xmath109 of the minimum of the effective potential , which is always located on the @xmath44 axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nears the origin of coordinates whenever the percentage of chaos rises .",
    "[ dmin]b shows the minimum distance to the origin for the orbits shown in fig [ dmin]a , versus their minimum distances to @xmath109 .",
    "we can see a consistent correlation between those quantities , hinting that the position of the minimum of the effective potential might influence the degree of chaos , although we were nt be able to find an analytic proof of this .",
    "the picture described above is consistent with the rising of the percentage of the chaotic motion with @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "[ percmn ] ) , since the acceleration grows with the mass of the bulge ( sec .",
    "[ galmod ] ) . also , it is consistent with the behaviour of the chaotic percentage seen in fig .",
    "[ perccn ] , considering that the more concentrated is the nucleus , the more acceleration it causes near the center .",
    "it also explains why the percentage of chaotic motion diminishes when the angular momentum increases ( fig .",
    "[ lzpercrit]a ) , given that a low angular momentum allows the star to approach the center of the potential .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ percmn ] shows that when the bulge is absent , there is no chaotic motion at all .",
    "whereas this proves that the onset of chaos is driven by the presence of the nucleus , it also poses a question mark about the abovementioned role of the centrifugal force , since it is at work even in this full regular case .    on the other hand , as it was seen in the previous section ,",
    "the variation of the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath32 and @xmath41 causes not only variations in the chaotic content , but also in the relative importance of the different regular families .",
    "in particular , the 4:5 resonance may be taken as a model , since it appears mainly when there is a low level of chaos , and decreases significantly or even disappears when we have a strong chaotic regime .",
    "therefore , it is of particular interest to investigate how its stability is being influenced by the above - mentioned parameters . for this purpose",
    ", we used the theory of periodic orbits @xcite , in which the stability criteria can be obtained from the elements of the monodromy matrix @xmath111 as follows : @xmath112 - 2,\\ ] ] where tr stands for the trace of the matrix , and @xmath113 is called the _ stability index_. for each set of values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath32 and @xmath41 , we first located , by means of an iterative process , the position of the parent 4:5 orbit onto the @xmath44 axis when @xmath114 .",
    "then , using these initial conditions plus the value of @xmath115 obtained from the energy , we integrated the variational equations in order to obtain the matrix @xmath116 , with which we computed the index @xmath113 .",
    "the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ res45evol ] ( a - d ) . in fig .",
    "[ res45evol]a we can see the evolution of the @xmath44 position and of the stability of the 4:5 resonance when @xmath11 varies , the values of all the other parameters being as in fig .",
    "[ percmn ] .",
    "green dots correspond to stable periodic orbits , while red dots correspond to unstable ones .",
    "we can see that when @xmath117 the periodic orbit becomes unstable .",
    "curiously , it is also unstable when @xmath118 . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ res45evol]b we see that the stability of the 4:5 parent periodic orbit is completely unaffected by the scale length of the nucleus . in this case , the values of all the other parameters are as in fig . [ perccn ] . in fig .",
    "[ res45evol]c , where we have used the values of the parameters as in fig .",
    "[ lzpercrit ] ( left ) , it can been seen that there is a limit of stability around @xmath119 .",
    "it is worth noticing that , though in fig .",
    "[ gridlz]a there is no evidence of a 4:5 resonance , fig .",
    "[ res45evol]c indicates that the resonance is indeed present , although evidently deeply buried in the chaotic sea .",
    "finally in fig .",
    "[ res45evol]d we present the influence of the value of the energy .",
    "the values of all the other parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ gridenm ] ( right ) .",
    "one may see that most of the periodic orbits are stable , except the region @xmath120 in which the periodic orbits become unstable .",
    "it is clear , then , that the parameters of the model , as well as the isolating integrals of motion , play a fundamental role in the stability of the regular families , which in turn determines which ones are present in each case .",
    "we have investigated how influential are the parameters of a disc galaxy with bulge on the level of chaos and on the distribution of regular families among its orbits .",
    "we have used an analytic axisymmetric potential which embraces the general features of a disc galaxy with bulge , and have chosen to work in the meridional plane of the orbits , in order to simplify the study .",
    "varying several of the constants of the potential , as well as the two global isolating integrals of the orbits , namely the angular momentum and the energy , we have found that the level of chaos and the distribution in regular families is indeed very dependent on all of these parameters .",
    "our study shows that the mass of the bulge , although spherically symmetric and therefore maintaining the axial symmetry of the whole galaxy , generates chaos in the meridional plane as soon as it is above zero . as the mass increases , this chaotic motion grows in percentage at the expense of the ( meridional plane ) box orbits , although it seems to saturate at @xmath121% of the orbits once the mass of the bulge has reached some @xmath122% of the mass of the disc .",
    "the concentration of the bulge plays a similar role : the percentage of chaotic motion depends almost linearly on this parameter . once more , box orbits and high - resonance orbits ( by which we mean resonant orbits with a rational quotient of frequencies made from integers @xmath123 ) are the ones that give way to the chaotic orbits",
    ". we also found that the angular momentum of the orbits influences the level of chaos in a similar fashion : orbits with low angular momenta have higher chances of being chaotic that those with high values of it .",
    "the relationship between chaos and angular momentum is close to linear , and , again , box orbits are the most affected by the percentage of chaos .",
    "the energy of the orbits , however , plays a different role . in a model with low level of chaos ,",
    "varying the energy mainly shuffles the orbital content among the families of regular orbits .",
    "interestingly , box orbits are again the family which suffers the most .",
    "taking a model with a medium level of chaos , box orbits are the dominant family at low energies , but the percentage of chaos quickly grows as the energy increases , again by collapsing the percentage of box orbits . in this case , however , linear orbits ( i.e. , 3d hollowed out saucers ) grow along with chaotic ones ; also , further increasing the energy reverts these trends , and 2:1 bananas start to increase their share . with a high level of chaos model , the increase of the energy diminishes the percentage of chaos , while the box and 2:1 bananas take the field .",
    "when taken into account that the effective potential in the meridional plane has a cusp caused by the centrifugal acceleration , all these behaviours turn out to be consistent with the analysis we made on sec .",
    "[ anres ] , where we arrived to the conclusion that a necessary condition for an orbit to be chaotic is to pass near the center of the potential , and a sufficient condition for an orbit to be regular is not to pass near the center of the potential .    in the same vein",
    ", we also conducted an investigation on the stability of the 4:5 resonance , which was taken as a model , in an attempt to see whether it depends on the parameters of the galactic system and the integrals of motion .",
    "our results indicate that , with the exception of the scale length of the nucleus , all the parameters affect substantially the stability of this family , hinting at a deep interplay between chaos and proportion of regular families .",
    "we ve also found that , by combining the mlcn and the sali algorithms , we can obtain for both methods reliable thresholds separating chaotic from regular motion .",
    "we consider the outcomes of the present research as an initial effort in the task of exploring the orbital structure of a disk galaxy with a central spherical nucleus .",
    "since our results are encouraging , it is in our future plans to study the influence of all the available parameters , including the disk s parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we plan to obtain the entire network of periodic orbits and reveal the evolution of their stability with respect to all the parameters of the galactic model .",
