    "for 32 edge - on spiral galaxies , spanning hubble type and mass , we fit the edge - on infinite disk model by @xcite on the irac mocaics : @xmath0 .",
    "we applied stellar dominated 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m channels and the pah emission at 8.0 @xmath1 m , with the stellar contribution subtracted ( using the prescription from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the data is from our dedicated go program ( go 20268 ) and the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "our program aims to populate the lower range of disk masses . from the fit",
    "we obtain the scale - length ( @xmath2 ) , the scale - height ( @xmath3 ) , and the face - on central surface brightness ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the edge - on disk model fits the stellar channels very well but the pah channel less so because of star - formation structures , such as hii regions , in the pah maps .",
    "the disk s total luminosity is inferred from the fitted model : @xmath5 , with @xmath2 the scale - length and @xmath4 the face - on central surface brightness ( see * ? ? ?",
    "combined with the rotational velocities from hyperleda , we can construct the tully - fisher relation for our galaxy disks and a plot of disk oblateness as a function of rotational velocity ( and hence dynamical mass ) .",
    "figure [ f : tf ] shows the inferred tully - fischer relation for these disks in one of the stellar channels , 4.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "notably , the slope ( @xmath6 ) is 3.5 , similar to what @xcite found but contrary for the increasing trend of slope with redder filters .",
    "the effects of age and metallicity of the stellar population become independent and opposite effects on the color - m / l relation in nir ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2d ) .",
    "hence , the shallower slope in the irac stellar channels , could well be this metallicity effect starting to dominate .",
    "the tully - fisher relation for disks in our sample .",
    "notably , the slope is very similar to the one found by @xcite for the sings sample .",

    "figure [ f : hz ] shows the relation between the disk oblateness the ratio of scale - length and -height , @xmath8 relative to the oblateness in 4.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m channels both trace the stellar population and their oblateness measurements agree well .",
    "the pah mosaic ( 8 @xmath1 m ) , shows flattening compared to stellar disk : @xmath9 .",
    "the pah disk s flattening is substantial in the case of the more massive disks ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this appears to corroborate the reasoning of @xcite that massive disks are vertically unstable and hence form the characteristic dust lanes .     the oblateness ( @xmath8 ) of the 3.6 @xmath1 m fit ( open triangles ) and 8.0 @xmath1 m pah map ( filled squares ) in terms of the 4.5 @xmath1 m . a similar oblateness as the 4.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "the oblateness of the stellar filters , 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m is very similar .",
    "the pah disk is flatter than the stellar , especially in massive disks ( @xmath10 , vertical dotted line).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "hence , from our disk models of irac data , we conclude :    * the tully - fisher relation has a shallower slope ( @xmath11 ) than naively expected from trends with filter ( figure [ f : tf ] ) , which may be a metallicity effect of the stellar population s",

    "the effect is not as pronounced as found by @xcite and @xcite based on dust lanes .",
    "the unique perspective of _ spitzer _ on edge - on spirals allows us to quantify the vertical structure in spiral disks .",
    "the pah maps are the product of both the ism density and star - formation .",
    "the stellar channels are effectively unaffected by extinction and can therefore serve as a reference to quantify dust lanes and smaller dust extinction structures .",
    "the phenomenon of truncation the sudden change in exponential behavior of disks can also be characterized for all irac bands ."
