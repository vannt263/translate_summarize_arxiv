    "the emerging field of quantum games @xcite  has attracted increasing attention during recent years .",
    "some authors @xcite have pointed out that , in certain cases , it is also possible to construct classical description of quantum games , resulting in the presently continuing debate @xcite  about their true quantum content and character .",
    "game theory is based on , and extensively uses , the theory of probability @xcite .",
    "the peculiar probabilities arising in the epr - type experiments @xcite are considered the basis of arguments for quantum non - locality @xcite . sometimes , these probabilities are also presented as the most convincing demonstration of how quantum and classical mechanics differ from each other .",
    "the motivation behind epr - type experiments is the epr paradox @xcite . in an attempt to resolve the epr paradox mckenheim @xcite  in 1982 made use of negative probability functions .",
    "moreover , recent years have witnessed explicit proofs @xcite showing how certain probability measures involved in some local hidden variable ( lhv ) models of the epr paradox attain negative values .",
    "quoting mckenheim @xcite `` _ _ kolmogorov s axiom may hold or not ; the probability for the existence of negative probabilities is not negative . _ _ '' also , feynman @xcite once cleverly anticipated @xcite that `` the _ only _ difference between the classical and quantum cases is that in the former we assume that the probabilities are positive - definite . ''",
    "the physical meaning of the negative probability measures is indeed far from obvious and this particular attempt to resolve the epr paradox is taken @xcite  _ as unattractive as all others .  _    in present paper we adapt a positive attitude towards negative probabilities by observing that , in spite of their unattractiveness , they seem to have undisputed value in terms of providing an indication to what can be taken as the true quantum character in certain quantum mechanical experiments .",
    "secondly , the negative probabilities , though labelled as unattractive , have a potential to provide an alternative , and perhaps much shorter , route to construction of simple examples of quantum games .",
    "these constructions designed for the physical implementation , and realization , of quantum games will , of course , have the epr - type experiments as their underlying physical structure .",
    "the approach towards quantum games , developed in this paper , can be divided into two steps . in the first step ,",
    "elementary probability theory is used to analyze a hypothetical physical implementation of a bi - matrix game , that is motivated by , and has close similarities with , the experimental set - up of the epr - type experiments .",
    "looking from a distance , this analysis can also be taken as a procedure that re - defines the classical game in a way that justifies and opens the way towards the next step in the present approach . in the second step the peculiar probabilities , coming out of the epr - type experiments",
    "are introduced to see their resulting effects on players payoff functions and solutions of the game .",
    "apart from a being a short - cut towards demonstration and construction of simple quantum games , to us this approach seems to be in demand presently both in game theory and economics @xcite .",
    "recent years have witnessed serious efforts to entertain the methods and notation of quantum mechanics in these domains . in our view , in spite of these developments , it remains a fact that in these domains the concepts of wavefunction , ket bra notation , and hermitian operators are still associated with an alien identity ; with quantum mechanics believed to be their _ only _ right place .",
    "present paper tries to fill in this gap by looking at how quantum games can also be understood by using the peculiar probabilities that appear in certain well - known quantum mechanical experiments , without recourse to the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics .",
    "in other words , we try to show how the unusual probabilities in epr paradox have a potential to leave their mark on game theory .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follow .",
    "section ( [ physical implementation of a bi - matrix game ] ) compares playing bi - matrix game with the setting of epr - type experiments to motivate a four - coin physical implementation of a bi - matrix game .",
    "section ( [ games with four coins ] ) develops such a hypothetical physical implementation .",
    "section ( [ games with perfectly correlated ] ) builds up on the construction of the previous section to look at how the game is affected when , instead of four coins , two correlated particles are used to play the game .",
    "we consider a two - player two - strategy non - cooperative game that is given as a bi - matrix .",
    "two players alice and bob are not allowed to communicate and each player has to go for one of the two available strategies .",
    "a usual physical implementation of this game consists of giving two coins to alice and bob , each receiving one .",
    "both receive the coin in head state .",
    "each player plays his / her strategy that consists of flipping / not flopping the coin .",
    "afterwards , the players return their coins to a referee .",
    "the referee observes the coins and rewards the players according to the strategies they have played and the game under consideration .",
    "consider now the well - known setting of epr - type experiments .",
    "once again , alice and bob are spatially separated and are unable to communicate with each other .",
    "both receive one half of a pair of particles that originate from a common source . in an individual run both",
    "choose one from the two options ( strategies ) available to him / her .",
    "the strategies are usually two directions in space along which measurements can be made .",
    "each measurement generates @xmath0 or @xmath1 as the outcome , which can be associated to head and tail states of a coin , respectively .",
    "experimental results are recorded for a large number of individual runs of the experiment .",
    "apparent similarities between the two - coin physical implementation of a bi - matrix game and epr - type experiments can immediately be noticed .",
    "the similarities hint to use epr - type experiments to play bi - matrix games .",
    "however , before moving further along that direction , following observations are made :    1 .   in two - coin implementation of a bi - matrix game , a player knows the head or tail state of his / her coin after he / she has played his / her strategy .",
    "2 .   in epr - type experiment when a player decides his / her strategy , as one of two available directions along which a measurement is to be made , he / she does not know whether the measurement is going to result in @xmath2 or @xmath1 , until the measurement has actually been made .",
    "it shows that a two - coin physical implementation of a bi - matrix game is not a right analogy to epr - type experiments . in an individual run of the epr - type experiment",
    "each player has to chose from one of two available directions .",
    "after the player makes a choice between the two directions , the measurement generates @xmath2 or @xmath1 as outcome .",
    "it motivates a four - coin implementation of the game .",
    "a bi - matrix game can also be played using four coins instead of the two described above . a procedure that physically implements the game with four coins is as follows .",
    "its motivation comes from the epr - type experiments and it serves to make possible , in the next step , a smoother transition towards a situation when the _ same _ game is played using those experiments .",
    "the players alice and bob are given two coins each .",
    "it is not known , and it does not matter , whether the given coins are in head or tail states . before the game starts",
    "the referee announces that a player s strategy is to choose one out of the two coins in his / her possession . after playing their strategies ,",
    "the players give the two chosen coins , representing their strategies , to the referee .",
    "the referee tosses both the coins together and records the outcomes .",
    "the tossing of the coins is repeated a large number of times , while each player plays his / her strategy each time he / she is asked to choose one of the two coins in his / her possession . after a large number of individual runs the referee rewards the players according to the strategies they have played and the probability distributions followed by the four coins during their tossing .    after stating the general idea , we consider in the following an example of a symmetric bi - matrix game .    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the players strategies",
    ". entries in braces are alice s and bob s payoffs , respectively .",
    "we want to physically implement the game ( [ matrix ] ) using repeated tossing of four coins which follows the following probability distribution    @xmath8    where , for example , @xmath9 is alice s pure strategy to `` always select the coin @xmath10 '' etc .",
    "the pure strategies @xmath11 and @xmath12 can similarly be interpreted . also ,",
    "@xmath13head and @xmath14tail and , for obvious reasons , we have    @xmath15    in construction of the four - coin statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) following points should be taken into consideration .    1",
    ".   the statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) may convey the impression that in an individual run both players forward both of their coins to the referee who tosses the four coins together .",
    "in fact , in an individual run the referee tosses only two coins .",
    "the statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) are generated under the _ assumption _ that there is randomness involved in players strategies to go for one or the other coin .",
    "2 .   associated with the above impression is the fact that , in every individual run , the statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) assign head or tail states to the two coins that have _ not _ been tossed .",
    "so that , in each individual run two tosses are _",
    "counterfactual_.    because counterfactual reasoning is involved in the derivation of bell - chsh inequality , some authors @xcite have argued that quantum non - locality @xcite  ( or locality ) does not follow from the violation of the bell - chsh inequality in epr - type experiments .",
    "with reference to our coin game counterfactual reasoning means that two coins , out of four , are not tossed in each individual turn , but still these untossed coins are assigned head or tail states in the mathematical steps used in the derivation of bell - chsh inequality .",
    "this assignment is often justified under the label of _",
    "realism_. in epr - type experiments the measurements along two directions , for each player , do not commute with each other i.e. joint measurements can not be made .",
    "based on this fact some arguments @xcite  say that the reasons for the violation of bell - chsh inequality in epr - type experiments reside _ only _ in non - commutative nature of the quantum measurements involved .",
    "to play the game ( [ matrix ] ) with four - coin statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) , we assume the referee has the following recipe ) is not unique and others may be suggested .",
    "any recipe is justified if it is able to reproduce the game under consideration within the description of the statistical experiment involved . ] to reward the players .",
    "@xmath16    where @xmath17 , for example , is alice s payoff when she plays @xmath9 and bob plays @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding payoff expressions for bob can be found by the transformation @xmath18 in eqs .",
    "( [ payoffs ] ) .",
    "the recipe , of course , makes sense if repeated tosses are made with four coins . because @xmath19and @xmath20 are taken as players pure strategies ; a mixed strategy for alice , for example , is convex linear combination of @xmath9 and @xmath21 .",
    "we now find constraints on four - coin statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) such that each equation in ( [ payoffs ] ) represents mixed strategy payoff for the bi - matrix game ( [ matrix ] ) , that can be written in bi - linear form . to allow this interpretation for the payoffs ( [ payoffs ] ) four probabilities @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "are required that can give a bi - linear representation to the payoffs ( [ payoffs ] ) i.e.    @xmath26    it then allows to make the association    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath25 are the probabilities of heads for coins @xmath19 and @xmath12 , respectively . in case a consistent set of these four probabilities",
    "is found , each equation in ( [ payoffs ] ) can be interpreted in terms of a mixed strategy game between the two players . so that , the four pairs    @xmath29    represent the four possible situations that may result when each player has got two strategies to choose from .",
    "for example , the strategy pair @xmath30 is associated with the pair @xmath31 and it corresponds to the mixed strategy game given as    @xmath32    in this game alice plays @xmath9 with probability of heads @xmath33 , and bob plays @xmath12 with probability of heads @xmath25 . the other equations in ( [ bilinear payoffs ] ) can be given similar interpretation .",
    "we now find constraints on four - coin statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) that make the payoffs of eq .",
    "( [ payoffs ] ) identical to the bi - linear payoffs of eq .",
    "( [ bilinear payoffs ] ) for any real numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "a comparison of these equations shows that it happens when @xmath28 and @xmath25 depend on @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , as follows    @xmath38    the probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath25 can be read from ( [ probability definitions ] ) as    @xmath39    provided that @xmath36 satisfy    @xmath40    with the defining relations ( [ discrete prob ] ) , and the constraints ( [ constraints on probs ] ) on the four - coin statistics , each pair in @xmath41 and @xmath42 gains interpretation of a mixed strategy game .",
    "the correspondence ( [ correspondences ] ) means that , for example , alice s payoffs read as    @xmath43    now , suppose @xmath44 is a nash equilibrium ( ne ) i.e.    @xmath45    using eqs .",
    "( [ bilinear payoffs ] ) one gets    @xmath46    consider the game of prisoners dilemma ( pd ) which is produced when @xmath47 in the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "we select our first representation of pd by taking    @xmath48    and the inequalities ( [ ne1 ] ) are reduced to    @xmath49    now from ( [ ne1 ] ) the pair @xmath44 is a ne when both inequalities in ( [ nepd ] ) are true for all @xmath50 $ ] . because @xmath51 and @xmath52 , it produces @xmath53 as the equilibrium . in present set - up to play pd this equilibrium appears if , apart from the constraints of eqs .",
    "( [ discrete prob ] , [ constraints on probs ] ) , we also have    @xmath54    which are other constraints on the four - coins statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) to hold true if the pd produces the ne @xmath55 .    the above analysis can be reproduced for other probability pairs in ( [ probability pairs ] ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath31 is ne i.e.    @xmath56    and we again get @xmath57 . the relations ( [ discrete prob ] ) though now say that it will exist as a ne when    @xmath58    which should , of course , be true along with the relations ( [ constraints on probs ] ) .",
    "that is , in order to reproduce a particular ne in the bi - matrix game the probabilities of heads of the four coins representing the game need to be fixed .",
    "also , from the bi - linear payoffs ( [ bilinear payoffs ] ) it is clear that at the equilibria @xmath55 and @xmath57 the reward for both the players is @xmath35 .    summarizing",
    ", we have shown that when the four - coin statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) satisfy the constraints of eqs .",
    "( [ constraints ] , [ constraints on probs ] ) , the payoffs ( [ payoffs ] ) can be interpreted in terms of a mixed strategy version of a bi - matrix game . in this setting four strategies @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath12 available to the players are associated with the probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "this association allows to interpret the payoff recipe of eq .",
    "( [ payoffs ] ) in terms of a mixed strategy game .",
    "we showed that when @xmath60 and @xmath25 are expressed in terms of the probabilities @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( as it is the case in the eqs .",
    "( [ discrete prob ] ) ) the bi - linear payoffs ( [ bilinear payoffs ] ) become identical to the payoffs of the eq .",
    "( [ payoffs ] ) . this procedure",
    "is designed to re - express playing a bi - matrix game with four coins in a way that choosing which coin to toss is a player s strategy .",
    "the re - expression of playing a bi - matrix game in terms of a four - coin tossing experiment , performed between two players , opens the way to see what happens when the four - coin statistics become correlated .",
    "especially , what if the correlations go beyond what is achievable with the so - called classical ` coins ' .",
    "presently , there appears general agreement in quantum physics community that the epr - type experiments , performed on correlated pairs of particles , violate the predictions of lhv models .",
    "negative probabilities are found to emerge when certain lhv models are forced to predict the experimental outcomes of epr - type experiments .",
    "for example , han , hwang and koh @xcite showed the need for negative probabilities when explicit solutions can reproduce quantum mechanical predictions for some spin - measurement directions for all entangled states . in han",
    "et al.s analysis a special basis is used to show the appearance of negative probabilities for a class of lhv models .",
    "rothman and sudarshan @xcite demonstrated that quantum mechanics does predict a set of probabilities that violate the chsh inequality ; however these probabilities are not positive - definite .",
    "nevertheless , they are physically meaningful in that they give the usual quantum - mechanical predictions in physical situations .",
    "rothman and sudarshan observed that all derivations of bell s inequalities assume that lhv theories produce a set of positive - definite probabilities for detecting a particle with a given spin orientation .    using a similar approach ,",
    "cereceda @xcite proved independently the necessity of negative probabilities in _ all _ instances where the predictions of the lhv model are made to violate the bell - chsh inequality .",
    "interestingly , cereceda s proof does not rely on any particular basis states or measurement directions . in the concluding section of his paper cereceda",
    "analyzes the case of pairs of particles that have perfect correlation between them .",
    "he then proceeds to show the necessity of negative probabilities for those pairs .",
    "the necessity of negative probability measures , to explain the experimental outcomes in epr - type experiments , motivates questions about the effects and consequences these may have on solution of a game which is physically implemented using such experiments .",
    "this question can be expressed as follows .",
    "what happens to the players payoffs and solutions of a game that is physically implemented using pairs of perfectly correlated particles ?",
    "it seems quite reasonable to demand that , when the predictions of lhv model agree with the bell - chsh inequality , the game attains classical interpretation .",
    "one clear advantage of the above approach towards quantum games appears to be that it is possible to see , without using the machinery of quantum mechanics , how game - theoretical solutions are affected when a game is physically implemented using quantum mechanically correlated pairs of particles .",
    "we follow cereceda s notation @xcite for probabilities in epr - type experiments designed to test bell - chsh inequality . two correlated particles @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "are emitted in opposite directions from a common source .",
    "afterwards , each of the particles enters its own measuring apparatus which can measure either one of two physical variables at a time .",
    "we denote these variables @xmath9 or @xmath21 for particle @xmath10 and @xmath65 or @xmath66 for particle @xmath64 .",
    "these variables can take possible values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath67 has a domain of variation @xmath68 and it determines locally ( for example , at the common source ) the response of the particle to each of the measurements they can be subjected to .",
    "it is possible to partition the set of all @xmath67 into @xmath69 disjoint subsets @xmath70 ( with respect to probability measure @xmath71 ) according to the outcomes of the four possible measurements , @xmath9 or @xmath21 for particle @xmath63 and @xmath65 or @xmath12 for particle @xmath64 .",

    "( [ pd(1 ) payoffs ( q ) ] ) it can be noticed that @xmath137 and @xmath138 can not be greater than @xmath10 when both @xmath132 and @xmath133 take negative values .",
    "we show now that it may not be the case with another representation of pd .",
    "that is , the extra freedom for @xmath132 and @xmath133 to take negative values , granted when the predictions of the lhv model disagree with bell - chsh inequality , leads to disqualification of @xmath130 to exist as a ne in that representation of pd .",
    "consider the pd with a slightly different value assigned to the constant @xmath35 of the game @xcite    @xmath139    in this representation the inequalities ( [ ne1 ] ) are reduced to    @xmath140    a substitution of @xmath141 from ( [ probscorrelparticles ] ) and then addition of both the inequalities gives    @xmath142    suppose that the predictions of lhv model disagree the bell - chsh inequality i.e. both @xmath115 and @xmath25 are to be replaced by @xmath132 and @xmath143 in ( [ cheongamene ] )    @xmath144    where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are given by ( [ ne when lhv violates chsh ] ) .",
    "interestingly , it is observed that the inequality ( [ cheongamene1 ] ) is violated if @xmath145 and the ne of eq .",
    "( [ ne when lhv violates chsh ] ) ceases to exist .",
    "of course , it applies to the representation of pd given by ( [ pdconstants2 ] ) .",
    "players payoffs are given as    @xmath146    as it is the case with the first representation of pd , the payoffs @xmath147 can not be greater than @xmath148 when both @xmath132 and @xmath133 taken negative values .",
    "it shows that in the physically implementation of pd , using perfectly correlated particles , the two representations ( [ pdconstants1],[pdconstants2 ] ) behave differently from each other . in representation ( [ pdconstants1 ] )",
    "the disagreement of the predictions of lhv model with the bell - chsh inequality leads to a displacement of the ne @xmath44 such that @xmath115 and @xmath25 can assume negative values .",
    "displacement occurs but @xmath44 continues to exist as a ne .    on the other hand , in the representation ( [ pdconstants2 ] ) the disagreement of the predictions of lhv model with the bell - chsh inequality leads to the disappearance of the ne @xmath44 when both @xmath115 and @xmath120 assume negative values and their sum becomes less than @xmath149 .",
    "alert reader may come up with a ` minimalist ' interpretation of the present approach as follows",
    ". constraints ( [ constraints on probs],[four - coin constraints2 ] ) are required on four - coin statistics ( [ 4 coin stats ] ) to make @xmath55 a ne when the pd is played in representation ( [ pdconstants1 ] ) with repeated tosses of four coins .",
    "when the _ same _ game is played with pairs of perfectly correlated particles and the predictions of lhv model disagree with the bell - chsh inequality , we can have @xmath121 or @xmath122 becoming negative which denies ( [ four - coin constraints2 ] ) .",
    "if it affects the solution of the game then one can say that it is because of the change in the underlying probabilities of our physical system . in our point of view",
    "it is _ not _ the question of changing the underlying probabilities . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a procedure that addresses the question asking what is the true quantum content of quantum game in the following two steps :    1 .   for perfectly correlated particles , developing an association that guarantees a classical game results when the predictions of lhv model do not violate the bell - chsh inequality .",
    "2 .   with above association retained , how solutions of a game are affected when the lhv model violates the bell - chsh inequality .    when these steps taken into consideration the possibility of construction of a classical game , that reproduces a quantum game , can not be taken as a blow to the subject of quantum games @xcite . in our opinion",
    "the question quantum game theory asks is how quantum mechanical aspects of a physical system leave their mark on game - theoretic solutions .",
    "the possibility of classical construction of a quantum game does not make the question disappear .",
    "the results in this paper can be summarized as follows . to establish a better comparison with epr - type experiments , a hypothetical physical implementation of a bi - matrix game",
    "is developed that uses repeated tosses with four coins .",
    "this opens the way to introduce directly the peculiar probabilities involved in the epr - type experiments , designed to test the bell - chsh inequality , into the proposed procedure to play a bi - matrix game .",
    "the argument rests on the result that when perfect correlations exist between two particles that are forwarded to two players , the violation of bell - chsh inequality by the predictions of a class of local hidden variable models forces certain probability measures to take negative values .",
    "we investigate how this aspect affects a game and its solutions when it is physically implemented using epr - type set - up . in such a set - up two choices are made available to each player that are taken as their strategies .",
    "players payoffs depend on the outcomes of repeated measurements and the constants that define the game .",
    "we find that a consistent set of probabilities can be obtained , given in terms of the statistics involved in the four - coin tossing experiment , such that the game between the players is interpretable as a classical bi - matrix game allowing mixed strategies .",
    "the proposal is designed in a way that allows , in the next step , to introduce directly the peculiar probabilities emerging in the epr - type experiments .",
    "we find that when the game is played with perfectly correlated pairs of particles , the players payoffs are observed to split into two parts ; which correspond to the two situations arising when the predictions , of the class of local hidden variable models , do and do not violate the bell - chsh inequality , respectively .",
    "apart from the splitting of the payoffs , we showed that the implementation using perfectly correlated particles distinguishes between two representations of the game that are completely equivalent in the classical context .",
    "we observed that the effects on a game - theoretic solution concept , of whether the predictions of the local hidden variable model do or do not violate the bell - chsh inequality , is sensitive to the particular representation used for the game ."
