    "the problem of the collision of two shoockwaves in four dimensions ( with lorentz signature ) that result from boosting two black holes to the speed of light is well known and has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "references @xcite provide only a subset of the work dedicated to the particular problem ( for some interesting recent developments see @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite deals with this problem pertubatively and in a series of three papers the authors compute the metric and derive a formula for the gravitational radiation .",
    "the collision is axisymmetric while the bulk matter that creates the shockwaves as well as the back - reaction effects are not taken into account .",
    "recently , the high energy physics community has also expressed special interest in the topic of shockwaves collisions in the framework of general relativity @xcite through the anti - de - sitter space / conformal field theory correspondence ( ads / cft ) @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft duality , allows to formulate a process that is associated with non - abelian gauge theories at strong coupling as a purely gravitational problem . as a result",
    ", one may map the problem of heavy ion collisions ( in four dimensions ) onto shockwaves collisions in gravity in five dimensions .",
    "recently , we have been involved in such problems @xcite in gauge theories at strong coupling whose dual five dimensional gravitational description , exhibits similar characteristics with those of shockwave collisions in ( ordinary ) four dimensional gravity .",
    "our goal in this work is to attempt to apply our earlier experience @xcite and especially apply the technique that we have developed in @xcite in ( ordinary gravity in ) four dimensions .",
    "we choose to work in a different coordinate system than @xcite in order to retain the geometrical insight of the collision and in addition we take into account the matter responsible for the creation of the shockwaves and the back - reaction effects as well .",
    "furthermore , the collision we consider here is not axisymmetric but is involves a non zero impact parameter .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .    in chapter",
    "[ sup ] we state the problem we want to solve and construct the main set up .",

    "equation ( [ s12 ] ) shows the form of the metric at all times while figure [ interaction ] offers a diagrammatical intuition of the terms of the metric we attempt to calculate in this project .    in chapter [ b2b ]",
    "we take into account the interaction of the one particle with the gravitational field created from the other and vice versa . in terms of feynman diagrams , loosely speaking , these corrections correspond to the diagrams of figure [ selfint4d ] .",

    "] of the corrections that have to been taken into account .",
    "we verify that the modified stress - energy tensor is conserved ( to the order of the expansion that we are working ) and we find that it is traceless .",
    "this last condition results into some pleasing simplifications for einstein s equations ( compare ( [ ein ] ) with ( [ ee ] ) ) .",
    "chapter [ fe ] deals with the field equations and the specification of the gauge .",
    "our attempt is to perform a perturbative calculation about a metric that looks almost flat but contains two shockwaves moving opposite to each other and colliding ( see ( [ s12 ] ) ) .",
    "the shockwaves provide an effective stress - energy tensor in addition to the ( actual ) stress - energy tensor ( see ( [ rmn2gtt ] ) ) that creates the two shockwaves ; these terms correspond to products of the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 of equation ( [ deq1 ] ) respectively .",
    "a suitable gauge choice simplifies the field equations ( [ deq1 ] ) to equations ( [ deq ] ) which are solved in the next chapter .    in chapter [ seq ]",
    "we specify the boundary conditions of the field equations ( [ deq ] ) and the corresponding green s function .",
    "in particular , we seek for causal solutions and therefore the associated green s function to the differential operator ( [ box ] ) is the retarded green s function .",
    "we show how the integrations on the light - cone and transverse plane may be performed omitting some of the intermediate steps for appendices [ a ] , [ b ] and [ c ] .",
    "eventually we derive a formula for the metric tensor , equation ( [ gmn2 ] ) , to the order we are working .",
    "this is our final result and it generally has the structure ( [ gmn ] ) .",
    "finally in chapter [ conc ] we discuss about the area of validity of our solution and summarize our conclusions . in particular , we argue that the presence of matter and the back - reaction effects may not be ignored as they result to an important contribution to the metric .",
    "we also see that as the impact parameter tends to zero , the metric diverges logarithmically .",
    "it is in our belief that this is a signal that a classical approach to the problem stops being valid and that a quantum description is required .",
    "lastly , we talk about the general form of the metric . although its evolution is constrained by casualty as expected ; this evolution takes place in an intuitive way : at a given ( proper ) time , any arbitrary point on the transverse plane evolves according from whether the signal from the center of the one or the other shockwave or both , has enough time to reach the point under consideration .",
    "we had encountered such a behavior in an analogous set up in @xcite although the geometry there was anti de sitter geometry in five dimensions . in @xcite",
    "we had claimed that a similar evolution of the metric should also be observed in four dimensions ; in this work we verify our conjecture .",
    "we begin by defining the coordinate system ( gauge ) we work .",

    "the convection for the flat metric that we use is @xmath11    we suppose that we have a black hole metric that we boost to the speed of light along a given direction ( @xmath12 direction ) . the metric is known @xcite and is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14",
    "according to equation ( [ ds1 ] ) we denote the transverse flat metric by @xmath15 while @xmath16 denotes the delta ( dirac ) function .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 has dimensions of length and its physical meaning will become apparent in what follows while @xmath18 serves as an ultraviolet cutoff and whose physical meaning is discussed in the conclusions ( see section ( [ scon ] ) ) .",
    "one may check directly whether ( [ ds1 ] ) solves einstein s equations which may be cast as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the ricci tensor , @xmath6 the stress - energy tensor and @xmath21 the newton s constant ( in four dimensions ) .    direct substitution of ( [ ds1 ] ) in the formula that computes @xmath22 results to    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a kronecker delta .",
    "this implies that all components of @xmath22 are zero except from @xmath25 . in order to arrive to equation ( [ rmn ] )",
    "we had to evaluate the following linear differential expression @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the laplace operator in two dimensions while we used the identity @xmath28    equations ( [ ein ] ) and ( [ rmn ] ) imply that the metric tensor of equation ( [ ds1 ] ) corresponds to a stress - energy tensor .",

    "this equation implies that the shockwave of ( [ ds1 ] ) is a consequence of a point particle moving along the @xmath39 direction with the speed of light and hence its massless .",
    "indeed , the ratio @xmath40 has dimensions of mass as should .",
    "one may check that @xmath6 of ( [ t1 ] ) is covariantly conserved .",
    "we may gain some insight in the physical system at hand if we use a diagrammatical approach . despite that general relativity",
    "is a non linear theory , the metric ( [ ds1 ] ) satisfies a linear differential equation .",
    "the fact that ( [ ds1 ] ) is an expression of a perturbation of a flat metric proportional to @xmath17 suggests the diagram of figure [ vertex ] .     which is measured at point @xmath38 .",
    "this is a very special case where a single graviton exchange between the source and the bulk happens to be an exact solution to the non linear einstein s equations . ]",
    "it represents the measurement of the gravitational field at point @xmath41 , which , loosely speaking , is created by a single graviton emission from the source ( point - like stress energy tensor ) of equation ( [ t1 ] ) with effective coupling proportional to @xmath42 . in other words for this special case of a single shockwave",

    "we want to collide these shockwaves ( and as a result the corresponding stress - energy tensors as well ) at a non - zero impact parameter and hence study the problem within the classical theory of gravity .",

    "@xmath45    the first three terms correspond to the flat ( minkowski ) space .",
    "the next two are of first order in @xmath17 and are created by the two point - like particles . these move ( initially ) towards each other along @xmath12 and they have an impact parameter @xmath46 along the @xmath29 axis as figure [ bten ] depicts .",
    "as they are the sources of the two shockwaves , they correspond to two vertex diagrams that look like the one in figure [ vertex ] .",
    "this is a superposition of two metrics with each one looking like ( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "however , the non - linearities of the gravitational field require higher order terms . the second order corrections are explicitly displayed in ( [ s12 ] )",
    "and they appear once the two shockwaves cross each other ; in the forward light cone .",
    "this is precisely the meaning of the @xmath47-functions ; they emphasize that the metric ( [ s12 ] ) solves einstein s equations exactly in the presence of both shockwaves only for negative @xmath48 .",
    "the additional terms of the metric appear in the forward light cone only and describe the effects of collision .",
    "the main work of this paper is to show how these terms may be calculated to order @xmath49 , that is find @xmath44 .",
    "the second order correction in @xmath17 of @xmath1 corresponds to the diagram of figure [ interaction ] .",
    "as has been already mentioned below ( [ t1 ] ) , @xmath50 is conserved in the gravitational field of ( [ ds1 ] ) , ( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , conservation for this case happens to be valid to all orders in @xmath17 appears in the resulting equations .",
    "this is in accordance with our intuitive picture of figure [ vertex ] : gravity behaves linearly with respect to the metric ( [ ds1 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath51     changes with time .",
    "the first source interacts via the gravitational field created by the other and vice versa .",

    "conservation to first order is still valid when we consider simultaneously @xmath50 and @xmath52 in the presence of the gravitational field ( [ s12 ] ) .",
    "however , this is no longer true at the second order in @xmath17 .",
    "the reason is because the @xmath53 ( @xmath33 ) source moves in the gravitational field of the @xmath36 @xmath54 shockwave , altering its initial trajectory .",
    "figure [ bten ] outlines what happens while figure [ selfint4d ] offers a diagramatical intuition regarding the self - corrections to @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that we should correct @xmath55 in order to preserve conservation ( of the total stress - energy tensor ) .",
    "however , since we do not know the nature ( equation of state ) of @xmath6 we make the assumption that these objects interact only via gravitational forces .",
    "since these particles are point - like and massless , they should travel along null geodesics ; as it is rigorously shown in @xcite conservation of ( the total ) @xmath56 is then guaranteed .",
    "this suggests that we need    @xmath57    which gives the total stress -energy tensor of both point - like particles of mass @xmath58 each moving along the trajectory @xmath59 parameterized by @xmath60 .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 is the determinant of the ( total ) metric tensor , the factor @xmath62 is in agreement with our convention ( that reproduces ( [ t1 ] ) - see below ) while the dots denote differentiation with respect to the parameter @xmath63 . before calculating higher order corrections to @xmath6",
    ", we find it instructive to check whether this formula reproduces ( [ t1 ] ) in the case of one particle ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the trajectory of this particle which moves ultra - relativistic ally along negative @xmath12 is parameterized by    @xmath65    in light cone coordinates and choosing to parameterize the trajectory by @xmath39 , equation ( [ tr1c ] ) then implies @xmath66 direct substitution of ( [ tr1lc ] ) to ( [ tpp ] ) yields @xmath67 which is exactly equation ( [ t1 ] ) ( for @xmath68 ) .",
    "this computation also clarifies the convection of @xmath62 in ( [ tpp ] ) .",
    "the part of @xmath6 of equation ( [ t2 ] ) due to the second particle is reproduced similarly .",
    "the next step is to calculate the next ( second ) order corrections ( in @xmath17 ) of @xmath6 which translates into finding the corrections to the trajectories @xmath69 .",
    "these may be obtained from the geodesic equations . in particular , we only need the first order corrections to @xmath69 as we already have a power of @xmath17 in front of the summation operator ( see ( [ tpp ] ) ) .",
    "the geodesic equations we need read    @xmath70    and are interpreted as the motion of particle @xmath71 in the gravitational field of the particle @xmath72 ( due to @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the christoffel symbols ) and vice versa ; this is precisely the meaning of the subscripts @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "the final step is to integrate ( [ geo ] ) using ( [ gam ] ) and using causal boundary conditions and substitute the result in formula ( [ tpp ] ) .",

    "<S> the problem of collisions of shockwaves in gravity is well known and has been studied extensively in the literature . recently , the interest in this area has been revived trough the anti - de - sitter space / conformal field theory correspondence ( ads / cft ) with the difference that in this case the background geometry is anti de sitter in five dimensions . in a recent project that we have completed in the context of ads / cft , </S>",
    "<S> we have gained insight in the problem of shockwaves and our goal in this work is to apply the technique we have developed in order to take some farther steps in the direction of shockwaves collisions in ordinary gravity . in the current project , each of the shockwaves correspond to a point - like stress - energy tensor that moves with the speed of light while the collision is asymmetric and involves an impact parameter ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> our method is to expand the metric @xmath0 in the background of flat space - time in the presence of the two shockwaves and compute corrections that satisfy causal boundary conditions taking into account back - reactions of the stress - energy tensor of the two point - like particles . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , using einstein s equations we predict the future of space - time using the fact that we know the past geometry . our solution respects causality as expected but this casual dependence takes place in an intuitive way . in particular , @xmath1 at any given point @xmath2 on the transverse plane at fixed @xmath3 evolves according from whether the propagation from the center of each of the shockwaves or from both shockwaves has enough proper time ( @xmath3 ) to reach the point under consideration or not . simultaneously around the center of each shockwave , </S>",
    "<S> the future metric develops a @xmath4-function profile with radius @xmath3 ; therefore this profile expands outwards from the centers ( of the shockwaves ) with the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the case of the zero impact parameter collision which results to the violation of conservation and we argue that this might be a signal for the formation of a black hole .    </S>",
