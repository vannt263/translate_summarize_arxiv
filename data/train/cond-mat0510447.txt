    "the concept of matter - wave lasers , which are intended to generate strong coherent beams of atoms , and many applications that such beams can find , are well known .",
    "it is commonly assumed that a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) may serve as a source of the matter - wave laser  beam .",
    "atomic lasing was considered in detail theoretically ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) and demonstrated in various experimental settings @xcite ; the topic was recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . of special interest is a possibility to construct a laser operating in a pulsed ( quasi - soliton ) regime , i.e. , periodically releasing narrow localized pulses of coherent atom waves , as proposed in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in that connection , it is relevant to mention that ( effectively ) one - dimensional solitons in bec with very weak attraction between atoms ( in @xmath2li ) were created in well - known experiments @xcite .",
    "the first models of the pulsed matter - wave lasers assumed release of quasi - solitons from an elongated (  cigar - shaped \" ) trap filled by a self - attractive bec .",
    "this scheme , while probably realizable in the experiment , does not offer sufficiently effective means to control the operation regime , and does not secure generation of a very large number of pulses in a nearly periodic fashion .",
    "a more sophisticated scheme was very recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which assumes zero nonlinearity coefficient ( i.e. , zero scattering length of inter - atomic collisions ) in a larger part of the elongated trap , and attraction between atoms ( negative scattering length )  in its smaller part , where the pulses are to be formed and released .",
    "the sign of the scattering length may be controlled and altered along the length of the trap by means of the feshbach resonance  @xcite ( this mechanism was used for the experimental creation of the bec solitons @xcite ) .    in this work",
    ", we aim to propose a different model of a pulsed matter - wave laser , in which the bec reservoir and the pulse - generating cavity are separated . as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] below , they are elongated parallel traps with linear coupling between them , due to tunneling of atoms . using the aforementioned possibility to control the scattering length by means of the feshbach resonance ,",
    "we assume that the interaction between atoms is ( very weakly ) repulsive in the reservoir , while in the cavity it is attractive ( and weak too , see below ) .",
    "additionally , the negative scattering length is assumed to be altered along the cavity s axis , which can be achieved using an appropriate configuration of the magnetic field responsible for the feshbach resonance ( we do not assume any time dependence of the scattering length or other parameters ) .",
    "besides using the magnetic field ,  it was predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite that  the feshbach resonance can be provided too by an adequately tuned optical field .",
    "accordingly , a spatially modulated stationary distribution of the light intensity may also be employed to provide for necessary spatially inhomogeneous feshbach - resonance configurations in the reservoir and cavity .",
    "it is relevant to mention that various soliton solutions in dual - core traps , with the linear coupling between the cores and _ opposite _ signs of the scattering length in them , were recently studied in detail @xcite , following an earlier work which was dealing with a model of dual - core nonlinear optical fibers with opposite signs of the group - velocity dispersion ( rather than nonlinearity ) in the two cores @xcite .    in the model introduced below",
    ", both edges of the reservoir , and the left edge of the cavity are impenetrable to atoms , while the right edge of the cavity ( a  valve \" )  allows the release of pulses into an outcoupling atomic waveguide , see fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the model was originally designed with an intention to provide for formation of a narrow quasi - soliton pulse in the cavity , that would periodically circulate in it , bouncing from the edges .",
    "each time that the soliton hits the right edge ( valve ) , a pulse is released into the outcoupling waveguide . after being slashed this way ,",
    "the intrinsic solitary pulse is supposed to replenish itself in the course of the subsequent cycle of the circulation by collecting atoms tunneling from the reservoir .",
    "accordingly , the initial condition is taken with a large number of atoms in the reservoir , and a small number in the cavity .    as described in detail below ,",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that the circulation regime outlined above may be observed , but it is not a really stable one : the intrinsic pulse would perform no more than @xmath1 circulations , quickly coming to a halt and getting broad .",
    "nevertheless , a very robust regime of the periodic release of pulses can be found in a large parameter region . in this regime , a broad  lump \" stays immobile in the cavity , performing periodic cycles of stretching and compression . when its right wing reaches the valve , in the course of each cycle of the vibrations , a new outcoupling pulse is released .",
    "the respective loss in the number of atoms in the cavity is compensated by the influx of atoms tunneling from the reservoir .",
    "the pulse - release cycles repeat very many times , till the reservoir gets essentially depleted .",
    "we stress that the model is a _ passive _ one , i.e. , it supports the stable pulse generation regime without any externally applied active control , such as periodically opening and shutting the valve by some clock signal .    ) depicts the valve releasing pulses into an outcoupling waveguide .",

    "the upper part shows the potential profile in the cavity , with the drop @xmath5 at @xmath6 corresponding to the valve.,width=384 ]    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the model is formulated .",
    "basic results , which demonstrate both unstable circulation - based and stable vibration - based regimes of the periodic generation of solitary pulses , are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the dependence of the operation of the matter - wave laser on its parameters , and give an estimate for the actual number of atoms in outcoupled pulses generated by the laser .",
    "the paper is concluded by section 4 .",
    "according to what was said above , the model of the matter - wave laser is based on a system of linearly coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) for the wave functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 of atoms in the ( effectively ) one - dimensional cavity and reservoir , with opposite signs in front of the nonlinear terms .",
    "we scale @xmath9 , the atomic mass @xmath10 , and the nonlinearity coefficient at @xmath11 in the cavity ( in physical units , the latter is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the @xmath14-wave scattering length of atomic collisions around @xmath11 ) to be @xmath15 .",
    "then , the coupled equations are cast in a normalized form , @xmath16where the coordinate @xmath17 takes values @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath19 is the length of both the cavity and reservoir ) . in accordance with what was said above",
    ", we assume a small positive scattering length ( weak repulsion between atoms ) in the reservoir , @xmath20 , while in the cavity the interaction is attractive , with the strength linearly increasing with @xmath17 ( @xmath21 is assumed ) , following a corresponding profile of the static magnetic or optical field that controls the scattering length in the cavity via the feshbach resonance",
    ".    the coefficient @xmath22 will be small ( see below ) , but it is needed to create an effective potential slope in the cavity : as the intra - cavity pulse gets ",
    "heavier \" due to the agglomeration of atoms tunneling from the reservoir , the term proportional to @xmath22 creates a gradually increasing effective potential which pushes atoms to the right ( since @xmath22 is positive ) . in the aforementioned circulation regime , this effective ( nonlinear ) potential pushes the intra - cavity localized pulse to the right . after hitting the right edge ( at @xmath23 ) , where the  valve \" is placed ( see details below )",
    ", the pulse loses a part of its mass , generating the outcoupled soliton .",
    "therefore , the force induced by the nonlinear potential drops , allowing the intra - cavity pulse to move in the opposite direction after the bounce from the right edge , until it will bounce ( without loss ) from the left edge , @xmath11 . this way , the nonlinear term proportional to @xmath22 may support periodic circulations of the internal pulse ( although , as said above , in the domain of the model s parameter space explored in this work the circulations are not really stable , eventually switching into the regime of vibrations ; the latter regime is possible with @xmath24 as well ) .",
    "further , we assume that an external parabolic potential acts in the cavity , @xmath25with the center set at the middle of the cavity .",
    "it is well known that such a potential corresponds to a magnetic or optical trap applied to the condensate @xcite .",
    "it will be shown below that the results are not sensitive to the exact shape of the intra - cavity potential ; in fact , essentially the same stable vibration regime can be obtained in the model with no potential .  note that eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) for the reservoir does not include any potential , as it is not necessary to generate the dynamical regime sought for .",
    "we also explored a model including a potential in the reservoir , but it did not affect the operation regime in any remarkable manner .",

    "( [ psi ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) makes it possible to set @xmath29 , which is fixed below .",

    "indeed , it implies that the local gradient of the phase of the wave function @xmath31 at the point @xmath6 , which is proportional to the atom s momentum , is fixed to be @xmath33 .",
    "this can be realized by assuming that , to the right of the point @xmath11 ( in the outcoupling waveguide ) , the cavity potential drops by @xmath50 ( recall we have set @xmath51 ) . the drop @xmath5 must be essentially larger than the potential and kinetic energy of atoms to the left of the point @xmath6 ( in the cavity ) . the latter condition , which amounts to@xmath52[see eq .",

    "we used the time step of @xmath64 , checking that smaller time steps gave virtually the same results ( while larger @xmath65 would generally be insufficient to produce accurate results ) .",

    "indeed , one may consider a small fluctuation which makes the norm of the pulse released into the outcoupling waveguide slightly smaller than in the established regime , hence the norm remaining in the cavity soliton becomes slightly larger .",
    "consequently , the strength of the effective nonlinear potential , that tries to push the soliton to the right , drops ( as a results of the bounce from the valve ) by an amount which is a bit smaller than in the unperturbed state , and the soliton will therefore slide to the left slower than in the absence of the perturbation . as a result ,",

    "the mechanism by which a fluctuation slightly increasing the soliton s norm leads to its still larger increase ( or , conversely , a fluctuation decreasing the norm causes its further decrease ) implies the instability . it may happen that the circulation regime can be stabilized in a model including an active element ( i.e. , _ forced circulations _ might be stable ) , but in this work we focus on the more fundamental passive model .    in the regime of vibrations",

    "<S> we propose a system which can generate a periodic array of solitary - wave pulses from a finite reservoir of coherent bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system is built as a set of two parallel quasi - one - dimensional traps ( the reservoir proper and a pulse - generating cavity ) , which are linearly coupled by the tunneling of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering length is tuned to be negative and small in the absolute value in the cavity , and still smaller but positive in the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a parabolic potential profile is created around the center of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> both edges of the reservoir and one edge of the cavity are impenetrable . </S>",
    "<S> solitons are released through the other cavity s edge , which is semi - transparent . </S>",
    "<S> two different regimes of the intrinsic operation of the laser are identified : circulations of a narrow wave - function pulse in the cavity , and oscillations of a broad standing pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the latter regime is stable , readily providing for the generation of an array containing up to @xmath0 permanent - shape pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the circulation regime provides for no more than @xmath1 cycles , and then it transforms into the oscillation mode . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the dynamical regime on parameters of the system is investigated in detail . </S>"
