    "clusters of 4 comprising several tens of atoms ( i.e. , of characteristic size of a few nm ) are perhaps the simplest quantum few - body system ; their investigation , both theoretical and experimental , has been pursued for a few decades now .",
    "early theoretical studies yielded considerable information on their structure,@xcite bose condensation,@xcite excitations@xcite and their predicted superfluid behavior@xcite at temperatures of the order of 1 k. + probing experimentally their physical properties is obviously a difficult proposition , as pristine 4 clusters are very weakly bound , easily fragmented , e.g. , on impact with a scatterer .",
    "thus , although some experiments were carried out , in which low energy 4 atoms were scattered off 4 clusters,@xcite most of what is now known about their physics , chiefly their superfluid properties , has come from spectroscopic studies of a single linear molecule ( e.g. , ocs ) embedded in them.@xcite + despite the remarkable microscopic insight afforded by this approach , the presence of the embedded impurity , whose linear size is typically that of a few 4 atoms , is expected to alter drastically the structure of a cluster of such a small size . specifically , a significant fraction of the 4 atoms are predicted to bind to the foreign molecule , while the rest arrange in shells around it.@xcite this is very different from the featureless structure of a pristine 4 cluster.@xcite the question therefore remains open as to whether one could probe experimentally the superfluid properties of a finite assembly of 4 atoms in a way that does not make use of a foreign impurity , and preserves at least the full rotational invariance of the cluster .",
    "+ aside from possible experiments on free standing clusters , with the aforementioned difficulties that they entail , one possibility that does not seem to have been given much consideration so far is that of studying 4 clusters enclosed in nanometer size cavities , e.g. , those of a suitably chosen porous material .",
    "for example , one could think of adsorbing 4 inside zeolites , whose pore diameter is typically of the order of a nm , and therefore may accommodate clusters of a few atoms .",
    "@xcite one could therefore think of investigating the physics of the clusters , e.g. , by performing neutron scattering experiments on the system , on the assumption that the bulk of the signal should come from helium confined inside the ( relatively regularly shaped ) cages . obviously , the presence of a confining surface is likely to affect significantly the structure and physical behavior of the cluster , compared to those of a free one .",
    "for example , one may expect superfluidity to be suppressed , with crystallization originating at the surface of the cavity , and then extending to adsorbed layers .",
    "+ while a classical hard - sphere fluid in spherical confinement has been the subject of much theoretical investigation,@xcite surprisingly little is known about the effect of this type of confinement on the superfluid transition of 4 .",
    "a number of studies of superfluidity of 4 in narrow cylindrical channels have been carried out , @xcite typically aimed at modeling 4 in porous media , or in the confines of carbon nanotubes.@xcite theoretical studies of adsorption of 4 on spherical substrates have mostly focused on layering on the outer surface of macromolecules such as fullerenes;@xcite however , the superfluid properties of 4 clusters confined inside spherical cavities of nanoscale size remain largely unexplored .",
    "a recent theoretical study of parahydrogen clusters confined inside spherical cavities of nanoscale size has yielded surprising evidence of enhanced superfluid response , with respect to free clusters,@xcite showing that the curved surface can affect in nontrivial ways the behaviour of the system .",
    "+ in this work , we carried out a theoretical study of structural and superfluid properties of clusters of 4 confined inside a spherical cavity of diameter 2 nm . specifically , we performed equilibrium quantum monte carlo simulation of a reasonably realistic model of the system at low temperature ( down to @xmath0 k ) .",
    "we considered the two limiting cases or strong and weak substrate , in order to differentiate geometrical effects from those arising from the specific nature of the adsorbing medium .",
    "our purpose is twofold : first , we aim at gaining some further insight in the effect of nanoscale confinement on the physical properties of 4 clusters ; second , we wish to furnish some definite theoretical predictions , helping in the design and interpretation of experiments on 4 adsorbed inside porous media whose open volume consists primarily of ( quasi)spherical cavities of characteristic size of few nm . +",
    "as expected , confinement drastically alters the structure of the clusters , in comparison to free standing ones , imparting clusters a well - defined shell - like structure ; nevertheless , superfluidity is resilient , and still observable within such tight confines at temperatures of order 1 k , under relatively broad conditions .",
    "the character of the superfluid response changes considerably , depending on the strength of the substrate . on a strong substrate , a quasi-2d superfluid film coats the surface ,",
    "undergoes crystallization as the density increases , and no reentrant superfluid phase is seen as a second layer ( i.e. , a concentric shell ) forms . on a sufficiently weak substrate , on the other hand , the system forms two concentric superfluid shells , reminiscent of what seen for parahydrogen in ref . .",
    "signatures of such different physics can be detected in the single - particle momentum distribution , probed by neutron scattering , a technique which has offered a great deal of insight into the physics of 4 and other quantum fluids ( like parahydrogen ) in the confines of porous media.@xcite + in the next section , we introduce the mathematical model of the system , and provide some basic details of the simulational technique utilized .",
    "we then illustrate our results and outline our conclusion in the following two sections .",
    "our system of interest is an ensemble of @xmath1 4 atoms , regarded as point particles of spin zero , enclosed in a spherical cavity .",
    "the quantum - mechanical many - body hamiltonian is the following : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the mass of a 4 atom , @xmath5 is the positions of the @xmath6th atom , measured with respect to the center of the cavity ( set as the origin ) , @xmath7 , @xmath8 describes the interaction of a pair of atoms , whereas @xmath9 describes the confinement of each atom inside the cavity .",
    "for @xmath8 we used the accepted aziz potential,@xcite whereas for @xmath9 we used the expression@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two parameters that are adjusted to reproduce the main 4 adsorption features of specific substrates .",
    "( [ potl ] ) is merely the extension to the case of a spherical cavity of the so - called  3 - 9 \" potential , describing the interaction of a particle with an infinite , planar substrate .",
    "@xmath15 is the depth of the attractive well of the potential experienced by a 4 atom in the vicinity of the substrate , whereas @xmath14 is essentially the distance of closest approach of a 4 atom to the substrate .",
    "+ as a model of 4 in the confines of , e.g. , the cages of zeolites , eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) clearly contains simplifications , chiefly the fact that the cavity is regarded as perfectly spherical and smooth .",
    "however , it allows us to address the physical question that we wish to pose here , namely the effect of confinement on the superfluid response of a 4 cluster .",
    "equivalent , or even simpler models ( e.g. , cavities with hard walls ) have been utilized to study structure of @xmath16he and classical fluids in confinement.@xcite + we obtained results for a cavity of radius @xmath17  , but with two distinct choices of the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ potl ] ) , corresponding to very different adsorption properties .",
    "the first choice , henceforth labeled with li , has @xmath15=17.87 k and @xmath14=3.76  ; these values are apt to describe the interaction of a 4 atom with a li substrate , one of the most weakly attractive known , on which 4 is predicted to form a superfluid monolayer at low temperature.@xcite + the second choice , namely @xmath15=100 k and @xmath14=2.05  , is roughly in the ballpark of what one would expect for 4 atoms near a silica substrate;@xcite thus , we shall henceforth refer to the scenario described by this parameter set as glass .",
    "the considerably deeper well , together with a much shorter range of the repulsive core , render the  glass \" much more attractive to 4 atoms than the li cavity .",
    "obviously , in neither case do we aim at reproducing accurately any realistic interaction ( which would require more elaborate functional forms anyway ) .",
    "rather , our aim is that of investigating opposite ends of the adsorption continuum .",
    "+ we studied the low temperature physical properties of the system described by eqs .",
    "( [ one ] ) and ( [ potl ] ) by means of first principle computer simulations based on the worm algorithm in the continuous - space path integral representation.@xcite specifically , we used a variant of the method which allows one to perform calculations in the canonical ensemble ( i.e. , fixed @xmath1).@xcite because this well - established computational methodology is thoroughly described elsewhere , we shall not review it here . the most important aspects to be emphasized here , are that it enables one to compute thermodynamic properties of bose systems at finite temperature , directly from the microscopic hamiltonian , in particular energetic , structural and superfluid properties of the confined 4 fluid , in practice with no approximation .",
    "technical details of the simulation are standard , and we refer the interested reader to ref . .",
    "all of the results reported here were obtained with a value of the imaginary time step @xmath18 k@xmath19 , with a high - temperature approximation for the many - particle propagator accurate up to order @xmath20 .",

    "we obtain ground state estimates by extrapolating to @xmath21 low temperature results . in pratice",

    "+ the same fits show that the chemical potential , obtained as @xmath29 becomes comparable to that of bulk superfluid 4 ( @xmath30 k ) for @xmath31 for a li cavity , and @xmath32 for glass . this estimate is relevant to possible experiments in which a porous matrix in which 4 is adsorbed",

    "clearly , the arrangement of the particles in the two cases is very different , reflecting the different strengths of the adsorption potentials .",
    "inside the more attractive glass cavity , 4 forms a single thin film ( a spherical shell ) coating the surface , whose effective 2d density at the minimum ( @xmath39 ) can be estimated to be @xmath40 @xmath41 , based on the position of the peak of @xmath38 .",

    "for example , one may measure the momentum distribution , typically by scattering neutrons off a sample of 4 adsorbed inside some suitably chosen porous medium . on the assumption that the bulk of the signal should come from 4 inside the cavities , one may look for the appearance at low temperature of a peak at zero momentum,@xcite which signals the onset of bose - einsten condensation , intimately connected to superfluidity .",

    "the peak is not sharp as it would be in bulk superfluid , but rather broadened by the fact the system is confined over a length of @xmath34 1 nm . in contrast , no such a peak develops if crystallization occurs inside the cavities .",
    "there is a quantitative difference between the signal observed in the glass cavity , inside which superfluidity is essentially 2d ( as mentioned above ) , and in the li one .",
    "the peak inside the glass cavity is stronger , @xmath55 slightly more structured and falls off more slowly at high @xmath57 than inside the li cavity , due to the localization of atoms in the vicinity of the cavity surface .",
    "the purpose of this study has been that of gaining insight into the physical behaviour of nanoscale 4 clusters inside a spherical cavity , with particular attention to the superfluid properties .",
    "the idea is that of providing a possible , alternate avenue to the exploration of clusters , one that does not involve the use of a foreign probe embedded in the cluster . obviously , the presence of the confining surface has a significant effect on the structure of the clusters , but the main result of this work is that superfluidity can still be observed at temperatures comparable to those at which its onset is predicted for free clusters .",
    "+ we have focused on spherical cavities of radius 1 nm , because they can accomodate clusters of a few tens of atoms , which is an interesting size because of the strong competition between surface and bulk energetics .",
    "we have shown that in a cavity carved inside a medium like silica , which exerts a strong attraction on 4 atoms , superfluidity can only occur in the form of a film coating the surface of the cavity , at equilibrium density . in an experiment",
    "in which the system is in thermal contact with a bath of superfluid 4 , our calculations show that cavities will be filled with frozen 4 , i.e. , no superfluid signal will be seen , at least down to @xmath0 k. on the other hand , in a weakly attractive cavity , especially one like that studied here in which the repulsive core of the interaction between atoms and cavity wall extends as far out as a third of the radius of the cavity itself , then one can expect the 4 fluid inside the cavity to display a significant superfluid response .",
    "+ clearly , the mathematical model contains important simplifications , notably the assumption that the cavity may be regarded as perfectly spherical and smooth .",
    "the expected minimum distance from the surface ( over 3  ) at which atoms sit in the case of a li substrate seems to justify at least in part the neglect of corrugation and surface defects , an assumption routinely made in numerical studies of adsorption of he or parahydrogen on alkali substrates.@xcite in the case of a strongly attractive substrate such as glass , such an assumption is clearly far more questionable .",
    "it is our hope that this work will provide at least some general aid in the design of experiments aimed at probing the superfluid response of nanoscale clusters of helium , or other quantum fluids ( e.g. , parahydrogen ) in confinement .",
