    "the simplest description of a supernova remnant involves a spherically symmetric shell whose expansion is smoothly decelerated by the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "actual remnants appear irregular , and this description must be supplemented by considering a variety of physical effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . among the instabilities that have been investigated are convective motions , the rippling of thin dense shells , and cooling instabilities affecting radiative shocks .",
    "much work has been done to investigate instabilities that may arise during the initial interactions between a supernova and its surrounding medium , during which the supernova first begins to decelerate .",
    "included are convective rayleigh - taylor - type instabilities in hollowed - out sedov - taylor solutions ( @xcite ) and at the interface between shocked supernova gas and shocked gas from the surroundings ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the effects of expansion into material with exponentially decreasing density ( @xcite ) .",
    "these instabilities do not prevent the blast wave from entering an adiabatic phase roughly described by the standard sedov - taylor solution .",
    "the dense shell that forms much later , when a remnant enters the radiative phase ( in which the cooling timescale becomes shorter than the remnant age ) is subject to a rippling instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when it occurs , the deviations from sphericity oscillate overstably , and the shell becomes wrinkled .",
    "linear models indicate that the oscillations grow as a power law in time .",
    "this paper focuses on the effects of the global cooling overstability on the evolution of a spherically symmetric supernova remnant . in this instability",
    "the cooling lengths of radiative shocks oscillate ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenon is essentially one dimensional , in the direction of shock propagation , and so is easily amenable to numerical investigation .",
    "the instability develops exponentially rapidly , and ( in the context of a decelerating shock ) requires no other external perturbations .",
    "bertschinger  ( ) suggested that this cooling instability could provide the initial seed perturbations to drive the slower - growing , later - phase rippling instability .    according to linear perturbative analysis with power - law cooling laws  @xmath1",
    ", instability occurs when  @xmath2 is small , @xmath3 ( @xcite ) . with such cooling laws ,",
    "fast shocks support long cooling lengths , and slow shocks require short cooling lengths .",

    "the simulations , which included the history - dependent effects of nonequilibrium cooling , showed that shocks with mean velocities  @xmath4 are unstable . observations of the vela supernova remnant ( @xcite ) have found evidence consistent with the presence of unsteady flow like that produced by this instability  unusually broad line widths ( of and ) and a discrepancy between the shock ram pressure and the postshock thermal pressure .",
    "cioffi , mckee ,  & bertschinger  ( ) gave a global picture of the evolution of a spherically symmetric supernova remnant .",
    "although this treatment of the entire remnant interior over most of the life of the remnant was not concerned with the details of shell formation , its supernova models provide a context for studying the instability .    in the calculations we discuss below , like cioffi et al .",
    "( ) we simulate a  @xmath5 explosion into a spherically symmetric interstellar medium .",
    "we adopt a simple cooling law  @xmath6 , where  @xmath7 is the density of hydrogen nuclei and @xmath8  is a piecewise power - law fit to the results of raymond , cox ,  & smith  ( ) , altered to turn off at low temperatures ( cf .",

    "we assume the gas to be completely ionized , and to include helium in a 1:10 ratio to hydrogen .",
    "this cooling law should allow us to capture the features of the cooling that lead to oscillations of the cooling column .",
    "when the remnant is young , the gas is hot , the cooling rate is small , and so the remnant is roughly adiabatic . the remnant changes from adiabatic to radiative near the time at which the remnant age equals the cooling time of the gas at the shock front .",
    "when cooling sets in , the gas behind the shock loses pressure support and so ( 1 )  the shock speed drops suddenly and ( 2 )  a dense shell builds up behind the shock . between the shock and the dense shell lies the cooling region .    after a brief transition period ,",
    "the behavior of the shock position  @xmath9 changes from the adiabatic scaling  @xmath10 toward the `` pressure - driven snowplow '' scaling  @xmath11  ( cioffi et al .  ) . since the timescale of the dynamical cooling instability is comparable to the cooling time ( @xcite )",
    ", the effects of the instability appear at the onset of the radiative phase if the shock velocity is sufficiently high ( i.e. , if allowed by the cooling law at the shock temperature ) .",

    "formation the shock velocity drops strongly until some postshock gas ends its period of rapid cooling , at which time this gas reaches its greatest density .",

    "since this cooling time drops rapidly as the shock slows , typically many cycles occur before the oscillations cease .",
    "the approximate expression  ( [ rpds ] ) for shock radius  @xmath25 during the pressure - driven snowplow stage gives the corresponding bounds on shock radii for which oscillations may occur .",
    "the intervals in time and shock radius are shown in figure  [ parameters ] , where the two lines represent the approximate beginning and end of the intervals .",
    "( we adopt  @xmath26 for this simple illustration . ) the need for sufficiently high shock velocity at the time of shell formation  ( [ minimum_nh ] ) is reflected by the truncation of this region at low values of  @xmath7 .",

    "as long as we can neglect the details of the initial explosion , we can cover the range of values of explosion energy  @xmath13 by varying the interstellar - medium density  @xmath7 , and applying this transformation .",

    "all of our spherically symmetric calculations assume an explosion energy of  @xmath5 .",
    "our inflowing gas has a temperature  @xmath33 .",
    "this is of course unrealistic , but the particular value does not affect the evolution of the shock so long as the shock remains strong .",
    "the rarest medium we consider has a density  @xmath34 .",
    "in the course of the simulations discussed below , the shock velocity becomes as low as  @xmath35 , with a mach number of  @xmath36 .",
    "for such a interstellar - medium phase , however , one expects the interstellar medium to have  @xmath37 .",
    "a  @xmath35 shock expanding into this hotter medium has a modest mach number of  @xmath38 , but the postshock compression is just 20% greater than the case of our @xmath39  medium . for larger - density interstellar - medium phases one expects ambient temperatures less than  @xmath39 and smaller discrepancies in the postshock compression . in these cases",
    "the fact that shocks faster than  @xmath40 heat preshock gas to temperatures  @xmath41 ( @xcite ) limits the shock strength .",
    "we find that the maximum deviation in the postshock compression is less than  @xmath42 from our numerical case .",

    "( ) , as discussed above .",
    "to account crudely for the turnoff of cooling in the recombination zone behind the shock front , we arrange for the cooling to vanish below a cutoff temperature  @xmath43 .",
    "our use of this function assumes that the emitting plasma is in collisional equilibrium .",
    "because collisional , ionization , and recombination rates are slow compared to the cooling rate , the evolution of the ionization state lags our equilibrium assumption ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at shock speeds greater than  @xmath40 , photons emitted by hot postshock gas",
    "preionize the inflowing gas ( @xcite ) so that the postshock gas tends to evolve toward equilibrium , but at lower shock speeds , where preionization is not so complete , postshock ionization rates are slow and the cooling may differ greatly from our equilibrium assumption .",
    "nonequilibrium simulations  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that oscillations occur for shock speeds  @xmath44 and that the essential feature required is a cooling law with a small local power - law index  @xmath2 .",
    "our equilibrium law should capture the correct qualitative behavior because it has this feature . with a more realistic cooling law , requiring explicit evolution of the ionization , simulating the many oscillations shown below would be a much more computationally taxing task . using our simplified cooling law",
    "our longest simulation ( the high - density @xmath45  case ) required approximately six days of computing on a sun sparc 10 workstation",
    ".    since we are interested in the dynamics of the cooling region ( unlike , for example , cioffi et al .  [ ] ) , our numerical simulations must allow for high resolution between the shock front and the dense shell .",
    "the cooling length  @xmath46 is quite short compared with the remnant radius , and as the dense shell expands and slows , the disparity between these two length scales increases .",
    "our eulerian finite - difference method incorporates a hierarchy of grids that allows high - resolution subgrids to be placed where needed .",
    "we place high - resolution subgrids in the cooling region ; typically on the order of 100 grid points ( evenly spaced , for the average cooling length ) are required to resolve the dynamics that drive the oscillatory instability . in cases where the disparity between cooling length and remnant size is the greatest ( that is , at the lowest speeds for which instability is expected )",
    ", we find that it is sufficient to place such high resolution at the two ends of the cooling region ( the shock front and the transition to the cool , dense shell ) , which have the steepest gradients .",
    "( appendix  a describes the model and numerical methods in more detail . ) unfortunately , even at this level of resolution , it is possible to validate the results of the simulations with rigorous convergence tests ( e.g. , @xcite ) only for short time intervals .",
    "experimentation with simulations with different resolutions indicates , however , that ( 1 )  we are able to identify when the instability is and is not present , and ( 2 )  we can readily determine the relative amplitudes and periods of oscillation to  @xmath47 .    for simplicity we simulate only a portion of the remnant s interior . for our first cases",
    "we start the simulations at an age well within the remnant s adiabatic phase , with the exact sedov - taylor blast - wave solution for adiabatic , point - like explosions  ( @xcite ) . for an interior boundary condition we set the flow variables equal to the values given by the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "we impose this condition at a radius small enough so that it has no effect on the evolution of the region close to the shock .    in figures",

    "in which there is some qualitative change , the oscillations are increased , not reduced .",
    "we conclude that these oscillations should persist in the presence of any upstream density fluctuations .",
    "the calculations discussed here show that when the cooling instability is active , the shock velocities of supernova remnants may fluctuate considerably .",
    "we see further that reverberations in remnant interiors , consequences of remnants complicated births , are unlikely to cause shock - velocity fluctuations of this magnitude .",
    "density inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium can cause or modify shock - velocity fluctuations .",

    "( that is , the shock must traverse this length scale a time comparable to the duration of one oscillation . )",
    "it appears clear that the shocks of many supernova remnants undergo the cooling instability discussed in this paper .",
    "the results should be generally correct , although details may be incorrect because of various assumptions : the computations are one - dimensional , the cooling treatment is highly simplified and does not take into account nonequilibrium effects , and the effects of magnetic fields and of radiative transfer are neglected .    in a separate paper ( @xcite ) we discuss simulations incorporating a magnetic field oriented transverse to the direction of shock propagation ( compression at the shock front tends to align the magnetic field into the plane of the front ) .",
    "these agree with the results of tth & draine ( ) , which show that magnetic fields can suppress the global cooling instability by providing a source of non - thermal pressure in cold , dense gas . for cooling laws such as the one we adopt for 130 to @xmath112 shocks , however , very large magnetic fields , corresponding to inverse alfvn mach numbers  @xmath113 ( where the alfvn speed is  @xmath114 ) in excess of  0.3 , would be required to change the qualitative oscillatory behavior .",
    "( we note parenthetically that the presence of a magnetic field can change the stability properties at a given shock velocity by changing the shock temperature ; this effect may change the velocity at which oscillations cease .",

    "a first requirement for the presence of the instability is for the remnant to be in the radiative phase .",
    "fast radiating remnants may readily be distinguished by the presence of strong optical emission lines ( the main sources of the cooling ) .",
    "for example , according to models like those of cox  & raymond  ( ) , highly temperature - dependent lines identify radiating shocks with velocities greater than  @xmath116 . in our results , radiating remnants are oscillatory if they have mean shock speeds greater than  @xmath117 , but thus far , most remnants with observed  lines have inferred shock velocities @xmath118 or @xmath119 , outside our range of interest .",

    "a different method for determining shock velocities was reported by koo & heiles  ( ) , who made 21-cm observations of a collection of northern remnants .",
    "although their observations were hampered by confusion with the galactic  background , in many remnants they found high - velocity gas .",
    "this gas is presumably accelerated by supernova blast waves , and if so it measures the mean remnant expansion speed .",

    "we note from figure  [ parameters ] that for a given remnant environment ( specified by some value of the ambient density  @xmath7 ) the range of shock radii for which oscillations may be observed is rather limited . if we consider a range of `` typical '' interstellar densities , however , for example , @xmath122 , we find a wide range of shock radii for which the remnants are candidates for oscillations :  @xmath123 ( assuming  @xmath124 )",

    "for these we use the lax - wendroff and lax - friedrichs schemes  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the method favors the high - order flux ( for accuracy ) but switches to the low - order flux where necessary to keep the updated variables within specified bounds .",
    "zalesak recommends choosing these bounds in the following way : calculate provisional , `` diffused '' updates  @xmath134 using the low - order fluxes .",

    "this internal - energy bounding proceeds in the following complicated way : the updated values of the flow variables are given by @xmath138 where  @xmath139 is the low - order , `` diffused '' provisional value and the `` antidiffusive fluxes ''  @xmath140 are defined as the differences between the high- and low - order fluxes .",

    "that it falls outside the acceptable range , we reduce  @xmath154 so that this test quantity falls within the acceptable range .",
    "( in other simulations , such as those incorporating a one - dimensional magnetic field  for example , those described in kimoto & chernoff [ ] we find that the above method does not prevent negative internal energies , and so we use the following alternative method : we find the two quantities  @xmath158 , the largest values of @xmath141 between @xmath142 and @xmath143 such that @xmath156 and @xmath159 ) lie in the acceptable range",

    "berger  & colella  ( , hereafter bc ) describe a method for solving systems of conservation laws on locally refined grids .",
    "( they describe both the method for working with a hierarchy of grids and an algorithm to determine where local mesh refinement is required .",

    "the bc method integrates local high - resolution calculations nested within larger , lower - resolution calculations .",
    "it maintains the global conservation laws , as required to ensure the correct evolution of discontinuities such as shocks .",
    "we borrow their method for maintaining multiple grids .    within the bc framework one must often interpolate values from coarse grids onto fine grids , for example , when introducing new fine grids or when calculating values at the boundary of existing fine grids .",
    "( the inverse process , transferring values from fine to coarse grids , must be done via spatial averaging in order to maintain the global conservation laws ) .",
    "we adopt the interpolation method used within the piecewise - parabolic method  ( ppm ) of colella  & woodward  (; @xcite ) .",
    "this method produces interpolating parabolas from gridpoint values .",
    "we enforce a monotonicity constraint , as described by colella  & woodward , but no more complicated modifications ( such as their discontinuity detection ) .",
    "the ppm interpolation method ensures that the values of conserved quantities on fine grids are completely consistent with their values on the corresponding coarse grids .",
    "( that is , the transfer of values back , from fine to coarse grids , yields the same coarse - grid values . )",
    "the method , however , occasionally yields unphysical values for fine - grid quantities . once again , the problem is usually negative pressures . in the calculations we made for this paper , such calculated unphysical values arose only in the region just outside the boundaries of fine grids .",
    "( the use of values just outside fine - grid boundaries is the way that fine - grid boundary conditions are enforced in the bc formalism . )",
    "when these unphysical values arise , we replace the interpolated quantities by physically allowed values , obtained by interpolating the `` primitive '' variables  @xmath166 ,  @xmath167 , and  @xmath168 directly .",
    "( we further require that the interpolating parabolas for  @xmath166 and  @xmath168 remain positive . ) because these are not the conservation - law variables , we lose `` consistency '' ( in the sense defined above ) between coarse and fine grids .",
    "this does not affect the treatment of the global conservation laws , however , because these values are used merely for boundary conditions , and do not lie within the fine grids proper .",
    "bc give a sophisticated algorithm for determining where to place refined grids , but for our purposes these are not required . in our simulations the region",
    "most in need of high resolution is always the cooling region just behind the main shock . within this region ,",
    "most important are its two edges , namely ( 1 )  the shock itself and ( 2 )  the region of rapid cooling and strong density gradient .",
    "it is computationally simple to determine the location of both these features by searching inward from the upstream boundary .",
    "( we locate the shock by its characteristic pressure jump , and we locate the steep density gradient by some large value of the mass density that it must encompass .",
    "of course , the latter criterion does not apply before the dense shell forms . )",
    "the subgrid for each refined region has a specified size , and on each time step a grid s subgrids may be translated to follow the motion of the appropriate features .",
    "refinement algorithms ( such as presented by bc ) may determine how much refinement should be applied , but we do not use these methods , either . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to choose a fixed grid size for each refined level within a computation .",
    "it is still possible for the program user to change the refinement of levels by pausing the evolution program and modifying the representation of the flow , but naturally it is practical to do this only at isolated times . in the spherically",
    "symmetric computations the mean cooling length decreases steadily as the shock velocity ( and hence the shock temperature ) decreases ; as it shrinks such intervention to decrease the grid size can be necessary in order to maintain sufficient resolution on the region .      for each time step of the coarsest grid in the grid hierarchy ( which corresponds to multiple time steps for its subgrids ) , we calculate a new value of the time step  @xmath169 . for hydrodynamic stability",
    "we obey the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition ( @xcite ) by calculating @xmath170 on the coarsest grid _ only .",
    "_ for accuracy of the cooling treatment , we calculate @xmath171 on all parts of _ each _ grid that is not covered by another , more highly refined grid .",
    "the time step used , then , is  @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "we enforce several types of boundary conditions .",
    "all are straightforward to implement numerically .",
    "our computational framework requires specification of input fluxes entering the edge zones so that the recipe for their updates is the same as that for interior zones .",
    "the enforcement of boundary conditions , then , requires methods for determining fluxes entering the computational region from the outside .",
    "first we describe the upstream ( ism ) boundary condition . in this region we know exactly what values the flow variables should take at positions off the computational region .",
    "thus we can define several ( phantom ) zones off the edge of the computational region .",
    "the edge fluxes can then be computed from these and the `` real '' zones inside the computational region , just as the fluxes in the interior are computed .",
    "next we describe the sedov - taylor interior boundary condition . here",
    "we are given particular values to impose at a particular position . in this case",
    "we simply define the flux entering that zone from the ( phantom ) exterior of the computational region to be whatever value is required so that the updated values in that zone take on the desired values .",
    "last we describe the perfectly reflecting boundary condition .",
    "we impose this condition at the position of the gridpoint itself . as in the previous situation",
    ", we choose the ( phantom ) momentum flux entering the edge zone such that the velocity there vanishes .",
    "for the other phantom fluxes , we set them equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the fluxes entering the zone from the interior of the computational region , since that is equivalent to having the zone divided in half by a wall ( which of course allows no fluxes through it ) ."
