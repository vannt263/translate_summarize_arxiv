    "the idea that our @xmath2-dimensional observed universe may be a hypersurface or `` brane '' in a higher dimensional spacetime is motivated by string- and @xmath3-theory  @xcite . in particular , @xmath0-dimensional braneworld scenarios , in which our universe represents the boundary of a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime , have recently received considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "the case in which the bulk spacetime is anti  de  sitter space and orbifold compactification is realized with the brane as fixed point has been particularly studied . in this situation",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath2-dimensional gravity is recovered on the brane  @xcite on energy scales much lower than the brane tension and/or bulk curvature , and late time cosmology is not changed if the brane tension is sufficiently high  @xcite . in an attempt to solve the fine - tuning problem between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension , more complex models in which the bulk or the brane are filled with several species ( such as scalar fields )",
    "have recently been proposed ( see for example  @xcite and references therein ) .    in these models @xmath1 symmetry is often assumed , and this is particularly convenient when considering boundary conditions on the brane . if @xmath1 symmetry is dropped , brane motion in the bulk must be taken into account and involved calculations are required in order to determine the boundary conditions on the brane .",
    "whilst @xmath1 symmetry is motivated by @xmath3-theory and is required for a supersymmetric brane configuration , such as a bps state  @xcite , there exist situations in which @xmath1 symmetry is broken .",
    "this occurs , for example , when the brane is charged and couples to a @xmath2-form field in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "cosmological asymmetric brane models have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "these developments have prompted us to derive gauge invariant perturbation theory for brane cosmology with one codimension .",
    "our aim is develop a formalism which may then be applied to any situation of cosmological interest .",
    "previously , perturbations in braneworld cosmology have been extensively studied in the literature mostly for the case of @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite . here",
    "we consider the most general situation in which the spatial background geometry on the brane has maximal symmetry and thus represents a space of constant curvature @xmath4 .",
    "we do not assume @xmath1 symmetry , and the boundary conditions on the brane are discussed .",
    "also , no particular gauge choice for the metric component @xmath5 is made .",
    "the perturbation equations in the bulk and on the brane are derived for general bulk and brane stress - energy tensors .",
    "this makes our formalism particularly convenient when analyzing situations in which different bulk components ( such as several scalar fields ) are also considered .",
    "the formalism can be used to study phenomena which have important observational consequences , the most important of them being the calculation of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "since one must in general first determine the behaviour of perturbations in the bulk before being able to determine their behaviour on the brane  @xcite , we pay particular attention to the relation between bulk and brane gauge invariant perturbation variables .",
    "these become more subtle when the position of the brane is displaced .",
    "indeed we define a set of gauge invariant variables in which the perturbation equations on the brane become similar to the usual @xmath2-dimensional equations .",
    "we then study the new terms arising in braneworlds .",
    "since we assume very general background spacetimes and no @xmath1 symmetry , some of our equations are extremely cumbersome . in order to guide the reader through the rest of the paper , we now give a general overview of the methods we use , the variables we introduce , and the equations we derive in this paper .",
    "the basic setup is one of a @xmath6-dimensional brane where the @xmath7-space of constant time is maximally symmetric ( a space of constant curvature ) , embedded in a @xmath8-dimensional bulk .",
    "as @xmath1 symmetry is not assumed , the bulk spacetimes on each side of the brane will generally differ .",
    "both the brane and the bulk may contain arbitrary matter .",
    "our notation is as follows :    * @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath7 , @xmath12  : spacetime coordinates ( greek indices ) , with metric @xmath13 and covariant derivative @xmath14 , * @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath7  : coordinates on the maximally symmetric @xmath7-space ( second part of latin alphabet ) with metric @xmath16 and covariant derivative @xmath17 , * @xmath18 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath7  : brane - worldsheet coordinates ( first part of latin alphabet ) , * @xmath19  : brane position in target - space .",
    "* a roman subscript @xmath20 indicates `` brane '' whilst @xmath21 denotes `` bulk '' . * certain variables such as the brane matter content ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , etc ) are only defined _ on _ the brane .",
    "other variables such as the normal vector to the brane @xmath24 or the extrinsic curvature @xmath25 are also defined at the brane position , but since they describe the embedding of the brane in the bulk , they may take different values _ on either side _ of the brane .",
    "all these brane - related variables are underlined .",
    "the action for the system is @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the gibbons - hawking boundary term required to consistently derive the israel junction conditions  @xcite , and @xmath28 is the fundamental @xmath0-dimensional newton constant ( related to the @xmath0-dimensional planck mass @xmath29 by @xmath30 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath31 is the bulk scalar curvature , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the bulk metric and the induced metric on the brane respectively , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the lagrangians for arbitrary matter in the bulk and matter confined on the brane .",
    "they may also contain a cosmological constant or brane tension .",
    "the induced metric on the brane is ( see for example  @xcite ) @xmath36 and the einstein equations resulting from action  ( [ action ] ) are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a covariant dirac @xmath39-function specifying the position of the brane ( see section  [ ssec_ee ] ) , and @xmath40 as noted above , we underline @xmath41 and @xmath42 to emphasize that they are only defined on the brane ( see section  [ seciii ] ) .",
    "we consider these einstein equations  ( [ einstein ] ) for a homogeneous and isotropic brane and bulk background with first order perturbations . as is summarised schematically in the left hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , these equations contain three parts : one is continuous ; the second is discontinuous across the brane ; and the third part is singular at the brane position ( proportional to @xmath38 ) .",
    "the coefficients of each of the individual parts must be equated , leading to a number of different equations .",
    "the continuous part gives the einstein equations in the bulk and , via the gauss - codacci equation , they also determine the @xmath2-dimensional einstein tensor on the brane ( see section  [ seciv ] ) .",
    "the discontinuous ( but non singular ) part is only non - trivial when @xmath1 symmetry is not assumed .",
    "it then gives equations for the continuous part of the extrinsic curvature , and it describes the energy and momentum exchange between the brane and bulk , leading to the equation of motion for the brane  the so - called `` sail equation ''  @xcite .",
    "finally , the singular part represents the second junction condition which relates the bulk geometries on each side of the brane through the brane geometry and matter content .    *   0.4 cm einstein equations conservation equations",
    "*    we also discuss the so - called conservation equations for the stress - energy tensors given in eqns  ( [ t1],[t2 ] ) .",
    "again , these contain a discontinuous , continuous and singular part . as is summarized schematically in the right hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the continuous part gives the bulk energy momentum conservation , the discontinuity simply describes the conservation of the jump of the bulk stress - energy on the brane , and the singular part leads to energy momentum conservation of the brane with a possible contribution from the bulk , and to the sail equation .",
    "when discussing the perturbations of these equations , we will make use of the maximal symmetry of the @xmath7-dimensional subspaces parallel to the brane .",
    "our geometrical quantities will be decomposed into scalar , vector and tensor degrees of freedom ( with respect to these @xmath7-spaces ) .",
    "this decomposition is not identical to the more physical one containing density modes , vorticity modes , and @xmath0-dimensional gravitational waves .",
    "the relationship between these two approaches is given in section  [ ssecsvtdvg ] .",
    "finally , in order to set up a consistent gauge - invariant formalism for the evolution of these perturbations , we will see that it is crucial to take fully into account the perturbed brane motion ( which can be written in a gauge invariant manner ) .",
    "this degree of freedom will be central to our analysis .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in the next section ( section  [ secii ] ) we discuss the unperturbed ( or background ) @xmath0-dimensional bulk : we allow a foliation ( with two codimensions ) into maximally symmetric @xmath7-spaces , and do not specify the presence of the brane .",
    "the einstein and conservation equations for the bulk background are derived . in section  [ seciii ]",
    "we introduce the brane and we discuss the boundary conditions at the brane position for the unperturbed spacetime without imposing @xmath1 symmetry . in section  [ seciv ]",
    "we derive the background equations for an observer on the brane . in section  [ secvi ] , we perturb the background .",
    "we introduce gauge invariant variables and derive the perturbed einstein and conservation equations in terms of these variables .",
    "the perturbed brane including the perturbation of the brane position is discussed in section  [ secvii ] . in section  [ secix ]",
    "we reformulate the perturbation theory from the point of view of an observer confined to the brane , and in the last section we draw some conclusions .",
    "finally , we also provide an extensive and highly technical appendix where we present all the relevant intermediate steps required to obtain the results presented in the text .",
    "( examples are , for instance , the perturbed christoffel symbols and the components of the perturbed riemann and weyl tensors . ) the appendix is , in fact , more general than the main text since there we consider an @xmath43-dimensional brane ( with an @xmath44-dimensional maximally symmetric subspace ) embedded in a @xmath45-dimensional bulk : in the text we have set @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , whilst the text presents the perturbation equations in full generality , some specific examples such as a bulk scalar field are discussed briefly in the appendix .",
    "in this section we describe the bulk background geometry and energy content without introducing a brane .",
    "we assume that the space orthogonal to the fifth dimension is maximally symmetric so that a homogeneous and isotropic brane can be accommodated , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we consider the most general stress - energy tensor which satisfies these symmetry conditions , and then derive the einstein equations and the conservation equations .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime with one timelike coordinate @xmath47 , and four spacelike coordinates @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that the constant time hypersurfaces are locally of the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a @xmath7-dimensional maximally symmetric space , i.e. , a @xmath7-space of constant curvature , parameterized by the coordinates @xmath52 , with spatial metric @xmath53 .",
    "the curvature of this space will be denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "for example , we may choose the coordinates @xmath54 such that @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "the last spacelike coordinate @xmath57 ( the `` extra dimension '' ) is orthogonal to the maximally symmetric space .",
    "the metric has the signature @xmath58 .",
    "the line element of the metric can therefore be written as @xmath59    an overdot will denote derivation with respect to @xmath60 , and a prime derivation with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , we shall define @xmath61 covariant derivatives with respect to the full metric will be denoted by @xmath14 , and those with respect to @xmath16 by @xmath17 . for convenience",
    "we also define @xmath62 as well as @xmath63 notice that @xmath64 and @xmath65 do not commute since @xmath66 .",
    "we now consider the bulk stress - energy tensor @xmath67 whose energy flux need not be at rest with respect to our @xmath68 coordinates .",
    "let @xmath69 be the normalized timelike eigenvector of @xmath70 with eigenvalue @xmath71 .",
    "correspondingly let @xmath72 be the normalized eigenvector orthogonal to both @xmath69 and to the maximally symmetric @xmath7-spaces , with eigenvalue @xmath73 .",
    "finally , let @xmath74 be the eigenvalue of the three eigenvectors parallel to the maximally symmetric @xmath7-dimensional slices .",
    "note that any symmetric tensor can be decomposed in this way , and that the symmetry requires that the eigenvectors parallel to the symmetric @xmath7-spaces are degenerate . in terms of these variables ,",
    "the bulk stress - energy tensor can be written as @xmath75 where the vectors @xmath69 and @xmath72 are given by @xmath76 here @xmath77 represents the lorentz boost which must be performed along the @xmath57 axis in order to be in the fluid s rest frame . when one is not in the rest frame of the fluid , both its energy density and its pressure along the extra dimension are modified , and the fluid exhibits a flux through an @xmath78 hypersurface .",
    "as usual , @xmath79 .    below it will be more convenient to use a different definition for the stress - energy tensor components  a definition which is less adapted to the fluid , but better adapted to our coordinates . to derive it ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath80 the @xmath0-velocity of a bulk observer who is at rest with respect to our coordinate system , @xmath81 and by @xmath82 the spacelike unit vector orthogonal to both @xmath80 and @xmath51 , @xmath83 note that neither @xmath80 nor @xmath82 are geodesic vector fields , but their orthogonality and normalization is conserved .",
    "the most general form of the bulk stress - energy tensor satisfying the required symmetry with respect to translations and rotations in @xmath84 can be written as @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes symmetrization . in components",
    "this gives @xmath87 thus @xmath88 is the bulk energy density as measured by an observer with @xmath0-velocity @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the energy flux transverse to @xmath51 , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 are the pressure along the directions @xmath93 , @xmath57 , respectively . the new variables @xmath94 , @xmath92 , @xmath91 and @xmath95 are related to the old ones by @xmath96 the last relation again shows that @xmath95 represents the energy flux in @xmath57 direction .",
    "this flux , as well as the energy density @xmath94 and pressure @xmath92 along the @xmath57 direction measured by an observer at rest with respect to the coordinate system , are obtained from the components of the stress - energy tensor in a frame at rest with respect to the fluid simply by a lorentz transformation .",
    "somewhat more complicated but equally straightforward expressions express the old variables in terms of the new ones ( see appendix  [ ssec_app_set ] ) .",
    "note that in  ( [ udef ] ) the bulk velocity of the fluid is @xmath97 .",
    "when @xmath98 , @xmath99 , we recover the case in which @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that the rest frame of the bulk matter and the coordinate system coincide .",
    "the christoffel symbols , the riemann , ricci , einstein and weyl tensors for the metric  ( [ metricback ] ) are given in appendices  [ ssec_app_christ ] , [ ssec_app_ric ] , [ ssec_app_ein ] , [ ssec_app_riem ] and [ ssec_app_weyl ] respectively , and the background bulk einstein equations are @xmath102 with the stress - energy tensor  ( [ emt ] ) and the einstein tensor from appendix  [ ssec_app_ein ] , eq .",

    "the first and the third of these equations ( [ einback00q],[einback05q ] ) are constraints ( i.e. , they do not involve second derivatives with respect to time ) .",
    "the other two are dynamical equations . in fact",
    ", there are only two independent dynamical variables which can be written as a combination of the scale factors @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",

    "of course other choices of coordinates are also allowed .",
    "we shall , however , keep @xmath107 undetermined , so that any useful choice for @xmath107 can be made at the end .",

    "the generalisation to several components is straightforward ( see appendix  [ ssec_app_cons ] ) . written in term of the intrinsic fluid quantities , they give an equation of evolution for the energy density @xmath71 and for fluid bulk velocity @xmath77 .",

    "as we shall see , the presence of the brane will introduce discontinuities at @xmath117 in several variables .",

    "we work throughout with gauge independent perturbation variables , which are inspired from a generalisation of the newtonian ( or longitudinal ) gauge to the @xmath0-dimensional case .",
    "first we introduce the bulk metric perturbation variables using the standard scalar , vector , tensor decomposition .",
    "we study their gauge transformation properties and define gauge invariant combinations .",
    "then , in section  [ ssec_pert_se ] , the perturbations of the bulk stress - energy tensor are considered , leading , in section  [ ssec_pert_ee ] , to the gauge invariant perturbed bulk einstein equations .",
    "finally we write down the perturbed conservation equations ( bianchi identities ) .",
    "let us consider the perturbations of a spacetime with one timelike and @xmath219 spacelike coordinates .",
    "the perturbed metric of this spacetime possesses @xmath220 different components . amongst these , a coordinate transformation allows @xmath221 of them to be fixed , so that there are @xmath222 independent metric coefficients .",
    "for example , in synchronous gauge , the @xmath223 are set to zero .",
    "when solving perturbation equations about a given spacetime , one is naturally led to classify perturbations .",
    "two classifications are of particular relevance .",
    "firstly , the perturbations may be classified according to their physical meaning , and this is done by looking at the spin of the perturbation in a locally minkowskian frame .",
    "the different perturbations are density ( spin @xmath224 ) modes , vorticity ( spin @xmath10 ) modes , and gravitational ( spin @xmath11 ) waves . secondly , the perturbations may be classified more geometrically in terms of irreducible components under the group of isometries of the unperturbed spacetime .",
    "this leads to scalar , vector and tensor perturbations . under some circumstances , these two classifications are identical .",
    "in particular , this is true for a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime , which can be foliated by a set of maximally symmetric spacelike hypersurfaces . in brane",
    "cosmology , however , the bulk is not as symmetric as in the flrw case , and the two classifications are different .    components which transform irreducibly under symmetries of the background spacetime evolve independently ( to linear order ) while the physical spin components mix .",
    "as explained above , metric perturbations can be decomposed according to their spin with respect to a local rotation of the coordinate system .",
    "this leads to density modes , vorticity modes , and gravitational waves .",
    "gravitational ( spin @xmath11 ) waves are `` true '' degrees of freedom of the gravitational field in the sense that they can exist even in vacuum .",
    "the number of gravitational wave modes is given by the dimension of the vector space spanned by symmetric , transverse , traceless rank @xmath11 tensors in an @xmath219-dimensional space : this is @xmath225 .",
    "in addition , when there is a non trivial matter content , there may be vorticity ( or spin @xmath10 ) modes arising from rotational velocity fields , which have @xmath226 independent components . finally , there remain @xmath227 possible density ( spin @xmath224 ) modes , which are usually represented by the two bardeen potentials @xmath228 and @xmath229  @xcite .",
    "more schematically , let us consider the metric perturbation around a locally inertial frame , written in synchronous gauge and in fourier space considering the wave vector @xmath230  : @xmath231 the quantities @xmath232 and @xmath233 describe the density modes ( with the standard definition of the bardeen potentials , one has @xmath234 and @xmath235 ) , the @xmath236 ( @xmath237 ) represent the vorticity modes , and the @xmath238 ( @xmath239 ) and @xmath240 ( @xmath241 ) represent the gravitational waves ( when @xmath242 , these notations agree with the standard definition of the @xmath243 and @xmath244 modes ) .",
    "the three above types of perturbation generally do not evolve independently : even at linear order , they are coupled if the unperturbed spacetime does not possess any symmetries .",
    "however , for most cosmological models ( including the ones considered in this paper ) , spacetime possesses some symmetries , being invariant under a certain group of global transformations .",
    "we consider the symmetry group @xmath245 with @xmath246 , which is of course relevant when there exists a coordinate system in which @xmath44 coordinates span a maximally symmetric space .",
    "when this is the case , perturbations may be decomposed into components which transform irreducibly under @xmath245-rotations of the coordinate system .",
    "this leads to what we call scalar , vector and tensor perturbations which are perturbations whose spin with respect to @xmath245 is @xmath224 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the main advantage of this decomposition is that the three new types of perturbation are now decoupled from each other , and hence are convenient when studying the evolution of cosmological perturbations .",
    "for example , consider an @xmath219-dimensional space with @xmath44 coordinates ( labelled by @xmath247 , @xmath248 , etc ) spanning an @xmath44-dimensional , maximally symmetric sub - space , with metric @xmath16 , and associated covariant derivative @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath249 remaining coordinates will be labelled by @xmath250 , @xmath251 , etc . in this case",
    ", the metric perturbations can be decomposed as @xmath252 where barred quantities are divergenceless @xmath44-vectors , and double barred quantities are divergenceless , traceless @xmath44-tensors of rank 2 ( with respect to the covariant derivative @xmath17 and metric @xmath16 respectively ) . with our definitions , it is clear that @xmath233 , @xmath232 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 are scalars , @xmath255 , @xmath256 are vectors , and @xmath257 are tensors under @xmath245 rotations .",
    "the perturbed metric components can then be written as @xmath258 with the @xmath259 describing @xmath257 . obviously , one has    * @xmath260 scalar degrees of freedom , * @xmath261 vector degrees of freedom and , * @xmath262 tensor degrees of freedom .    by definition ,",
    "the tensor components are spin @xmath11 quantities and represent gravitational waves .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath263 , not all the gravitational waves are tensor perturbations ( with respect to @xmath245 ) : @xmath264 of them are actually scalar or vector perturbations .",
    "in fact , the spin of the second decomposition can be understood as the projection of the spin of the first decomposition on the maximally symmetric space .",
    "therefore , density modes are always scalar perturbations , vorticity modes can be either scalar of vector perturbations , and gravitational waves can be any of the three . by comparing eqns  ( [ dgphys ] ) and  ( [ dggeom ] ) , it is clear that :    * the @xmath260 scalars decompose as @xmath11 density modes , @xmath249 vorticity modes , and @xmath265 gravitational waves , * the @xmath261 vectors represent @xmath266 vorticity modes and @xmath267 gravitational waves , * the @xmath262 tensors all represent gravitational waves .    for our purpose ( @xmath268 ) , this reduces to    * @xmath2 scalar degrees of freedom which split into the @xmath11 density modes , @xmath10 vorticity mode , and @xmath10 gravitational wave , * @xmath2 vector degrees of freedom which go into @xmath11 vorticity modes and @xmath11 gravitational waves , * @xmath11 tensor degrees of freedom which all represent gravitational waves .",
    "as expected , we have @xmath269 degrees of freedom @xmath0 of which are gravitational waves .",
    "this decomposition ensures that even in the vacuum , the scalar and vector parts of the einstein equation will allow non trivial solutions .",
    "these are usually called `` graviscalars '' and `` graviphotons ''  @xcite .",
    "this effect represents the most striking change to the physics of brane cosmological perturbations as compared to that of the standard flrw case since it can occur at arbitrary low energy as long as the corresponding gravitational waves exist in the bulk .",
    "the brane is , by definition , described by @xmath270 coordinates : one timelike and the @xmath44 spacelike coordinates spanning an @xmath44-dimensional maximally symmetric space . for the case of one codimension , we have @xmath271 .",
    "the perturbed induced metric of the maximally symmetric space then has @xmath272 independent components .",
    "an important question is how these perturbations can interact with the bulk perturbations .",
    "it is clear that whatever the bulk matter content , there are at least @xmath273 degrees of freedom which arise from the gravitational waves in the bulk .",
    "therefore , one can expect that @xmath225 of the brane perturbations can interact with the bulk .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case : the second israel condition essentially states that the discontinuity of some bulk perturbations which can exist even in the vacuum describe the matter content of the brane .",
    "but this also suggests that one additional scalar degree of freedom of the brane is likely not to be directly related with the bulk perturbations .",
    "it happens , indeed , that this extra degree of freedom physically corresponds to the perturbation of the brane position in the bulk , which is independent of the gravitational waves .",
    "for example , if the bulk is pure minkowski space , one can consider a fixed coordinate system ( as , e.g. , newtonian gauge , which is unambiguously fixed ) .",
    "the position of the brane in this coordinate system is defined independently of the metric perturbations .",
    "this extra degree of freedom ensures that in any situation all the brane perturbations can be related to bulk perturbations ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to make the link between these two sets of perturbations .",
    "we now make use of maximal symmetry on @xmath51 .",
    "due to rotational invariance , we can split the perturbations into components which transform irreducibly under rotations , i.e. , into different @xmath274-spin components , which evolve independently to first order perturbation theory .",
    "one could then go on and split these into irreducible components under translations , corresponding to the expansion in terms of eigenvectors of the laplacian on @xmath275 ( which is the fourier transform in the case @xmath276 )  @xcite .",
    "following the discussion of the last paragraph , the perturbed line element can be generally written as @xmath277 here , the @xmath278 indices of @xmath279 , @xmath280 are labels .",
    "the quantities @xmath281 and @xmath279 are vectors on @xmath51 which can be respectively decomposed into scalar ( spin 0 ) components @xmath251 , @xmath282 , and divergenceless vector ( spin 1 ) components @xmath283 , @xmath284 , such that @xmath285 .",
    "equivalently , the tensor on @xmath51 , @xmath286 , can be decomposed into two scalars , @xmath233 and @xmath232 , a divergenceless vector , @xmath255 , and divergenceless , traceless , tensor ( spin @xmath11 ) component , @xmath257 , such that @xmath287 .",
    "this decomposition is @xmath288 the indices of these @xmath51-quantities are raised and lowered with the metric @xmath16 .",
    "the symmetries of the metric ensure that the scalar ( @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath233 , @xmath232 , @xmath289 , @xmath282 , @xmath280 ) , vector ( @xmath283 , @xmath255 , @xmath290 ) and tensor ( @xmath257 ) quantities evolve independently .",
    "let us consider an infinitesimal coordinate transformation @xmath291 with @xmath292 under this coordinate change the geometrical perturbations transform in the following way : @xmath293 ( recall that @xmath294 and that @xmath295 .",
    "in this section we will use both this notation and the @xmath296 defined in eqns  ( [ defperpu],[defperpn ] ) : we aim to do so in such a way as to keep the equations as simple as possible . )",
    "we can therefore define the following four scalar and two vector perturbation variables , which are invariant under infinitesimal coordinate transformations , also called gauge transformations in this context : @xmath297 the two vector variables possess two independent components ( hence four degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the tensor variable @xmath257 is gauge invariant since there are no tensor type gauge transformations , and possesses two independent components .",
    "all these quantities represent a generalisation of the newtonian gauge often used in flrw cosmologies ( we can no longer call it a `` longitudinal gauge '' , as @xmath298 ) .",

    "however , things are more complicated since some of these quantities involve first or second derivatives with respect to the fifth dimension , and hence they are not always regular at the brane position ( see section  [ ssec_reg_pert_geom ] ) . for this reason",
    ", other gauge choices are often preferred , but not essential .",
    "we now perturb the unit vectors @xmath69 and @xmath72 , defined in eqns  ( [ tdef][ndef ] ) , which are the timelike and spacelike eigenvectors normal to the maximally symmetric @xmath7-spaces .",
    "it follows from the normalization conditions , eqns  ( [ udef],[ndef ] ) , that each vector has only four independent components .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath69 and @xmath72 are eigenvectors of a symmetric tensor , they are normal to each other , @xmath303 .",

    "the perturbed brane embedding is given by @xmath344 here @xmath345 is the displacement of the brane from its background position @xmath346 , and it is a function on the brane worldsheet . it is a true new degree of freedom which sometimes also called `` radion '' @xcite . on the contrary , as we will soon see , the perturbations in the @xmath347 and @xmath348 directions can be set to zero without loss of generality , as they do not lead to any physical consequences ( e.g. , to a physical `` deformation '' of the brane )  @xcite .",
    "it was first noticed in @xcite that , when studying brane perturbations of a randall - sundrum background ( of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , using the transverse and traceless gauge in gaussian normal coordinates , the brane position is no more at constant @xmath57 in presence of matter sources .",
    "the presence of an @xmath349 can be interpreted as a bending of the brane due to the presence of matter or gravitational waves .",
    "the bending @xmath345 can in principle be set to zero by choosing a convenient set of bulk coordinates such that @xmath350 , since by the infinitesimal coordinate transformation defined in the previous section , eq .",
    "( [ cico ] ) , one has @xmath351 this is not , however , the most general possibility . as was noted in  @xcite",
    ", such a gauge choice will also fix the gauge of some other perturbation variables .",
    "in fact , if we choose @xmath352 such that @xmath345 is zero , @xmath301 is fixed ( see eq .",
    "( [ transmetfin ] ) ) . in a gauge invariant",
    "approach one must keep @xmath345 arbitrary .    we now can define the perturbed vector orthogonal to the brane , @xmath353 .",
    "one easily obtains ( see appendix  [ ssec_app_pert_brane2 ] ) @xmath354 note that no vector perturbations enter in the above formula .",
    "this is just a consequence of frobenius theorem  @xcite .",
    "also , the fact that the perturbations @xmath355 do not enter in the above expression illustrates that they do not correspond to any physical deformation of the brane ( see further comments below ) .      in this subsection",
    "we calculate the perturbed first fundamental form which will be used in the perturbed first israel junction condition in the following subsections .",
    "we shall first look at the perturbation of the induced metric @xmath356 . in doing so , it is important to recall that the brane embedding in the unperturbed and perturbed bulks ( respectively given by  ( [ embdeb][embfin ] ) , ( [ embpertdeb][embpertfin ] ) ) are different . therefore , each brane variable has two contribution to its perturbation : one coming from the perturbation of the variable and a second contribution due to the fact that we have to evaluate it at the perturbed brane position .",
    "we obtain @xmath357 where , to first order in perturbation theory , the right hand side of these equations are evaluated at @xmath358 ( corresponding to the unperturbed embedding ) . as usual",
    ", we can decompose the perturbation @xmath359 into its scalar and vector parts using the metric @xmath16 evaluated at the unperturbed brane position : @xmath360 .",
    "this is possible since , for perturbations , the time derivative @xmath361 and spatial derivatives @xmath362 are equivalent to derivation with respect to @xmath363 and @xmath364 respectively .",
    "a word of caution is in order here .",
    "recall that the quantities @xmath250 , @xmath233 , @xmath151 , @xmath150 , etc .",
    ", are defined in the bulk . however , due to the presence of the brane , they may be ( and in fact , are  see below ) discontinuous at the brane position . for this reason",
    ", they may only be evaluated on each side of the brane .",
    "therefore we must check that the above expressions are consistent in the sense that they have the same value when evaluated _ on both sides _ of the brane  only if that is the case , they can be considered well defined _ on _ the brane . as we shall soon see , this consistency in fact results from the first israel condition . anticipating this result ,",
    "the above equations allow us to define in the standard way the brane perturbations @xmath365 , @xmath366 , etc . , @xmath367 using the standard @xmath2-dimensional perturbation theory , we construct the two bardeen potentials , as well as the brane vector and tensor metric perturbations , @xmath368 ( the two first equations are equivalent to eqns  ( 5.21 ) of ref .  @xcite . ) finally , using eq .",
    "( [ def_q ] ) , the perturbed first fundamental form is @xmath369 notice that the @xmath359 do not appear in equations  ( [ corina][corine ] ) : this is again related to the fact that they do not represent physical degrees of freedom .",
    "these above expressions can also be obtained by starting from the definition @xmath370 paying attention that in the perturbed and unperturbed cases , the bulk metric is not evaluated at the same position ( @xmath371 and @xmath117 respectively )  @xcite .      using eqns  ( [ transmetdeb][transmetfin],[upstrans ] ) ,",
    "the coordinate transformations of the following variables are obviously continuous as they do not involve derivatives with respect to @xmath57 : @xmath372 given the first fundamental form  ( [ gina][corine ] ) , the first israel conditions imply that these quantities , which are linear combinations of the components ( [ gina ] ) to ( [ rona ] ) of the perturbed first fundamental form @xmath373 , are continuous , @xmath374 or , equivalently @xmath375 hence tensor perturbations are continuous and only the two scalar quantities @xmath336 , @xmath337 and the vector quantity @xmath343 may jump .",
    "the first two equations are equivalent to @xmath376 which ensures that the brane bardeen potentials @xmath377 and @xmath378 are well defined .",
    "we also see that the bulk vector and tensor perturbation @xmath342 and @xmath257 may be defined on the brane where they reduce to the standard vector and tensor metric perturbations of a @xmath2-dimensional spacetime with maximally symmetric spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "equivalently , the corresponding first fundamental form can be rewritten as @xmath379 which indeed reduce to @xmath380 , @xmath381 and @xmath382 , in longitudinal gauge ( @xmath383 ) for scalar perturbations and in the gauge @xmath384 for vector perturbations .",
    "so far we have given the relationship between the intrinsic brane metric perturbations , the brane displacement @xmath345 , and some of the bulk metric perturbations .",
    "things become a little bit more involved when we consider the other bulk metric perturbations that appear in @xmath385 .",
    "as we already noticed , the first israel condition does not constrain @xmath280 ( see eq .",
    "( [ corine ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , since the transformation law for @xmath280 can be written as @xmath386 and since all the metric coefficients must remain finite , it follows that @xmath387 ( see also appendix  [ sec_app_pert_bulk_geom ] ) . furthermore , as the coordinate transformation @xmath388 must be invertible , we also require @xmath389 . thus if @xmath107 is not continuous , then @xmath390 : @xmath391 this is the only additional requirement that one must impose on the coordinate system in the vicinity of the brane .",
    "note that if @xmath1 symmetry is assumed , @xmath392 must be imposed even though @xmath107 is continuous  @xcite .    as mentioned in section  [ ssec_israel_and ] ,",
    "the only place where discontinuities or singularities are allowed is the brane position .",
    "when @xmath393 , the brane is at @xmath117 .",
    "however , if the brane position is perturbed , @xmath349 , the above requirement implies @xmath394 and hence @xmath107 is not allowed to jump if the brane position is perturbed .",
    "if the unperturbed metric has a zeroth order discontinuity in the coefficient @xmath107 , the brane position must remain at @xmath393 to first order perturbation theory ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this statement is in fact valid even in the absence of metric perturbations ( see appendix  [ sec_app_pert_bulk_geom ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the coordinate transformations of the variables @xmath395 and @xmath396 given in eqns  ( [ rona],[brigitta ] ) , @xmath397 the first israel condition also states that @xmath398 therefore , in order for the transformations  ( [ t0perp],[tiperp ] ) to be continuous we have to imply that a valid coordinate change satisfies @xmath399 these conditions ensure that @xmath400 and @xmath401 admit second derivatives .",
    "this standard requirement for any valid coordinate transformation is therefore preserved even in the presence of a brane . in particular ( see eqns  [ transabbe],[transe ] ) ) , this means that _ if _ @xmath402 or @xmath403 are discontinuous ( which is allowed ) , then @xmath299 and @xmath300 _ can not _ be transformed identically to zero by coordinate changes .",
    "this does not prevent the quantities @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath336 , @xmath337 from being well defined .",
    "however , it does mean that there may not be a coordinate system in which eqns  ( [ newtdeb][newtfin ] ) are valid ( which we never needed to suppose ) .",
    "the first israel condition does not require the continuity of @xmath336 and @xmath343 , see eqns  ( [ isrvp],[isrhi ] ) below . finally , from @xmath404 and using the fact that @xmath387 , the jump @xmath405 is gauge invariant .",
    "therefore the gauge invariant quantity @xmath337 given in eqn  ( [ vhpp ] ) may contain a singular part , @xmath406 which again shows that @xmath337 can not always be a component of the perturbed metric tensor in the vicinity of the brane .",
    "of course , this does not invalidate the results found previously , but simply suggests that other variables may be more suitable to describe the metric perturbations in the vicinity of the brane .",
    "after these remarks on the regularity requirements of gauge transformations in a bulk - brane system , we can now define some further gauge invariant scalar variables in terms of which we will express the second israel condition .",
    "they will also be used to write the einstein equations for an observer on the brane when we want to compare our results with the usual @xmath2-dimensional cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "let us first define the gauge invariant combination @xmath407 since @xmath301 can be discontinuous , @xmath408 is defined on each side of the brane .",
    "note that we have @xmath409 furthermore , we set @xmath410 when @xmath107 is continuous , @xmath411 can be interpreted as the `` gauge invariant brane position ''  that is , the position of the brane unambiguously defined when @xmath412 is set to zero by a suitable coordinate change ( which always exists _ if _",
    "@xmath107 is continuous ) .    in principle , derivatives normal to the brane are not defined for brane variables .",
    "but in what follows we will also use @xmath413 which we simply define as @xmath414 in other words , the operator @xmath65 acts on every metric perturbation defined in the bulk but not on @xmath345 ( i.e. , we define @xmath415 ) . along similar lines",
    ", one can also define @xmath416 and @xmath417 .",
    "the quantity @xmath413 can contain a singular term because of the discontinuous part of @xmath418 .",
    "therefore , it is useful to define @xmath419 by @xmath420 this new quantity can take different values on each side of the brane , so that we can define @xmath421 and @xmath422 following eqns  ( [ discbrn],[contbrn ] ) .",
    "we may not simply continue @xmath345 into the bulk as a variable @xmath345 is independent of @xmath57 .",
    "this is a gauge dependent continuation and the definitions for @xmath423 and @xmath416 given above would be valid only in the gauge where @xmath345 is independent of @xmath57 . from the above expressions it is also clear that the variables @xmath423 and @xmath416 and all brane perturbation variables which contain these derivatives , like e.g. @xmath424 below , are gauge invariant only with respect to gauge transformations parallel to the brane .",
    "therefore , it is important to keep in mind that these quantities are defined only on ( each side of ) the brane , although the notation @xmath413 , @xmath419 may be slightly misleading .",
    "they simply refer to eqns  ( [ upnor1],[upnor2 ] ) .",

    "( [ singhpp ] ) , it appears that @xmath424 does not contain a singular term ( and hence it is a quantity that has a meaning on each side of the brane ) .",

    "the above equations will become very useful when considering the second israel conditions and writing down the perturbed weyl tensor .",

    "then the induced metric is given by : @xmath535 @xmath536      for any quantity @xmath118 , we define @xmath537 where @xmath538 is the discontinuity of @xmath118 , @xmath124 is the continuous part of @xmath118 and @xmath120 is the heaviside function .",

    "formally , one can take a stress - energy tensor of the above form to describe the brane content , provided that we have @xmath543 with @xmath544 the condition @xmath99 and @xmath98 has not necessarily to be satisfied but is a consequence of the coordinate choice to put the brane at rest with respect to the coordinate system . because of the dirac term  ( [ def_beta ] ) , @xmath545 and @xmath546 depend on @xmath547 only .",
