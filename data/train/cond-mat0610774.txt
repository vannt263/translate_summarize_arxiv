    "the advent of nanotechnology provides us today with nanoscale devices that can affect flow phenomena that are important for several technological applications .",

    "the detailed investigation of flow physics at the nanoscale has been pioneered by koplik @xcite using molecular dynamics ( md ) models . when nanoscale devices are active parts of micro and macroscale systems , a hybrid approach is required to integrate atomistic simulations with computational methods suitable for larger scales .",
    "a number of hybrid models coupling atomistic to continuum descriptions of dense fluids have been proposed  @xcite .",

    "@xcite employed a domain decomposition algorithm to simulate couette flow over a nanopatterned surface , as well as a cavity flow where the singularity at the corners between static and moving walls was described atomistically . in these simulations",
    "a singular boundary force is employed in order to compensate for the elimination of periodicity in the md system .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an algorithm using the alternating schwarz method to couple an md model to an incompressible navier - stokes ( ns ) finite volume solver .",
    "they proposed a novel boundary force , based on the physical characteristics of the fluid that is being simulated .",
    "they reported on simulations of flows past a cnt and noticed average departures from reference md simulations of the order of @xmath0 .    here",
    "we extend the model proposed in @xcite by replacing the finite volume solver that was provided by a commercial software package ( star - cd ) by a lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method  @xcite solving the incompressible ns equations .",
    "the proposed extension aims to take advantage of the mesoscopic modeling inherent in lb simulations and to allow for a broader geometric flexibility than the one allowed by the finite volume solver .",
    "in addition , in the present work we enhance the exchange between atomistic and continuum domains by not only communicating velocities as in  @xcite but also velocity gradients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : model ] , we describe the hybrid model by outlining the md and lb methods and describe their coupling .",
    "results of liquid argon flows past and through a cnt are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we compare the flows to the reference md solutions and discuss the computational efficiency of the hybrid model and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the present hybrid method an md model describes the flow in the vicinity of a carbon nanotube ( cnt ) while a lb approach is used to simulate the behaviou of the continuum system away from the cnt .",

    "it is further described in  @xcite .",
    "the cnt is modeled as a rigid structure to facilitate the investigation of the flow of argon .",

    "the velocities @xmath29 of the particles in the cell @xmath27 are updated as @xmath30    the slower the velocity relaxes towards its desired value the smaller the amount of perturbations introduced in the system . on the other hand choosing a small value of @xmath28 increases the number of iterations to reach equilibrium and thus decreases the computational efficiency . here",
    "we choose as a relaxation parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the continuum hydrodynamics are described by the incompressible navier - stokes equations @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fluid velocity , @xmath34 the pressure , @xmath35 the density and @xmath36 a body force .",
    "we use @xmath36 to enforce dirichlet boundary conditions , see discussion below .",

    "subtracting equations ( [ eq1 ] ) from ( [ eq3 ] ) leads to an expression for the forcing term @xmath71    it is worth noting that evaluating @xmath67 within an lb method consists only of performing a streaming step .",
    "indeed by construction of the equilibrium distribution function ( @xmath72 , see  @xcite for details ) , the second term of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : lbdynamics ] ) does not change the velocity @xmath33 .",
    "we use a domain decomposition algorithm to couple an md description of a dense fluid with an lb model solving the incompressible ns equations .",
    "the computational domain is decomposed into two overlapping regions of an lb domain and an md subdomain .",
    "[ fig : decomposition ] shows the schwarz decomposition used to converge to a steady state solution by alternating iterations between steady state solutions in the lb domain and md subdomain .",
    "a schwarz iteration @xmath73 consists of computing the continuum velocity field @xmath74 with boundary conditions set by the previous atomistic cycle @xmath75 and an external boundary condition that depends on the system considered .",
    "then , @xmath74 is used to set the boundary condition for computing @xmath76 .",
    "md velocities are sampled in cells of same size as in the lb domain and are enforced on the continuum according to two coupling methods using equation ( [ eq : forcingterm ] ) .",
    "the first approach corresponds to the one used by werder _",
    "et al . _ and is to impose md velocities within a one cell wide strip located at a distance @xmath77 of the md subdomain , see fig .  [",
    "fig : decomposition ] . this velocity coupling ( vc )",
    "approach does not enforce velocity gradients implying that the geometry of the system and the external boundary conditions dictate whether the hybrid solution evolve into a good approximation of the reference solution . to alleviate this issue",
    "we propose an enriched coupling method which enforces velocities , and implicitly velocity gradients ( vgc ) by imposing md velocities on every common cell except within a strip of width @xmath77 close to the boundary ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : decomposition ] ) .",
    "we shall observe below that using the vgc approach leads to closer match with md reference solutions than when using the vc method .",
    "we use the algorithm proposed by werder _",

    "@xcite to impose non - periodic boundary conditions ( npbc ) on the md system .",
    "details of the algorithm can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we first consider the flow past a cnt embedded normal to the flow direction in order to compare our results with  @xcite .",

    "the cnt is of chirality @xmath81 with a radius of @xmath82 nm . we choose the density of argon @xmath83 kgm@xmath84 and the temperature @xmath85 k. this corresponds to the dimensionless state point @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we let @xmath89 be the boltzmann constant , @xmath90 kgmol@xmath17 the atomic mass of argon , and @xmath91 avogadro s number .",
    "the md subdomain size is @xmath92 nm@xmath79 centered around the cnt which is subdivided into @xmath93 sampling cells where @xmath94 argon atoms are initially equilibrated for @xmath95 ns . the width of the strip around the boundary on which both md and lb are simulated is @xmath96 nm .    we consider an lb domain of size @xmath97 covering the entire domain where lattice nodes are centered on the corresponding md sampling cells .",
    "the viscosity of the lj fluid is a parameter of the lb model and set to @xmath98 m@xmath99s@xmath17  @xcite .",
    "we have performed a sensitivity analysis by increasing and decreasing the viscosity by @xmath100 and found it to be a robust parameter with respect to accuracy .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath101 ms@xmath17 are imposed at the inlet @xmath102 nm and outlet @xmath103 nm .",
    "this high velocity is chosen to reduce the number of sampling iterations .",
    "the temperature is controlled by using a berendsen thermostat  @xcite with a time constant @xmath104 ps .",
    "we apply it cell - wise in all directions in the boundary cells where the velocity is prescribed and only in the z - direction in other cells .",
    "the hybrid model is run for @xmath105 cycles which consists of running the lb simulation for @xmath106 ns ( @xmath107 iterations ) followed by an md step equilibrating for @xmath95 ns ( @xmath108 iterations ) and sampling for @xmath109 ns . we discuss below how @xmath110 affects the convergence of the results .",
    "[ fig : nano ] shows a comparison between hybrid converged solutions and an md reference solution over the entire domain .",
    "the latter involves @xmath111 argon atoms and the temperature is controlled as in the md subdomain .",
    "the reference md velocity field is sampled over @xmath112 ns . a qualitative match with the reference md solution",
    "is obtained when using the vc approach .",
    "the match between the hybrid solution and the reference md solution becomes quantitative when using the vgc method .",
    "this is due to the fact that velocity gradients are not let free but implicitly imposed .",
    "a consequence of this is that discrepancies in the wake and on the sides of the cnt that appears when using the vc approach , and also reported in  @xcite , are not observed when using the vgc method .",

    "[ fig : velprof ] shows the evolution of the norm of the velocity along the @xmath113 nm and @xmath114 nm plane .",

    "this unphysical state leads to the formation of high velocity regions around the cnt .",
    "they then slowly spread out on the sides of the tube and increase the side velocity .",
    "considering the vgc approach , we observe that the velocity upstream and downstream adjusts smoothly to the reference solution .",
    "the situation is different when employing the vg method .",
    "indeed the hybrid velocity profiles show deviations from the md reference solution especially downstream the cnt .",
    "it is worth noting that we get identical results when initializing the system with initial conditions closer to the steady solution .    [",

    "we measure a @xmath116 increase that can not be described by the incompressible ns equations .",
    "this issue could however be alleviated by considering a compressible lb model  @xcite .    in this conformation",
    ", the velocities around the cnt are non - zero .",
    "the corresponding continuum velocity boundary condition is unknown and a function of the system parameters  @xcite .",
    "a continuum solution approximating the reference solution is therefore unfeasible .",
    "the computational efficiency of the lb - md model is estimated by comparing the time needed to compute one iteration of the reference and hybrid solution , respectively .",
    "we measure @xmath117 s and @xmath118 s in the case of the flow past a cnt .",
    "the hybrid solution is computed @xmath119 times faster than the reference solution .",
    "we get a ratio @xmath120 in the case of a flow through a cnt .",
    "ratios @xmath121 are of the same order as the volume ratio between the md domain and subdomain .",
    "small systems have been chosen here in order to compare hybrid to reference solutions .",
    "considering larger systems would exhibit much higher ratios .",
    "for example , nanodevices ( @xmath122 nm@xmath79 ) embedded in microscale systems ( @xmath123 @xmath124m@xmath79 ) would lead to ratios of the order of @xmath125 .",
    "we have presented a hybrid model coupling a lattice boltzmann solution of the incompressible navier - stokes equations to a molecular dynamics simulation of a dense fluid , using a schwarz domain decomposition technique .",
    "the two descriptions are coupled via an exchange of velocities ( vc ) or velocity gradients ( vgc ) .",
    "the applicability of the method was demonstrated in flows of liquid argon past carbon nanotubes normal and aligned with the flow velocity .",
    "we have first computed the flow past a cnt with an axis normal to the flow velocity . using the vgc approach we observed quantitative agreement between the hybrid and the reference md solutions with an average error of @xmath126 that provides an improvement over previously reported results @xcite for the same configuration .",
    "we attribute this improvement to the fact that we enforce velocity within a region rather than along a strip implying that velocity gradients and in turn shear forces are implicitly exchanged between the two descriptions .",
    "we also show that the velocity vanishes around the tube in this conformation making a continuum solution a good approximation of the reference solution .",
    "this is not the case however when considering the flow through a cnt .",
    "the transport of argon in the cnt is captured within @xmath127 with our lb - md model . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that fully 3d hybrid simulations have been reported in the literature .",
    "in addition of being a tool to help investigating multi - scale physics by considerably reducing an otherwise prohibitive computational time , this approach largely extends the applicability of lb models by providing us with fully microscopic boundary conditions .",
