    "despite their ubiquity , the properties and organization of passive tracer transport in 3d time - periodic flows has received less attention than 2d flows@xcite , largely because the correspondence between 2d incompressible flows and one degree - of - freedom hamiltonian systems breaks down for 3d systems .",
    "the correspondence between 2d incompressible flow and hamiltonian mechanics means that for such systems , the tools and techniques of over a century of research into hamiltonian chaos can be directly applied to understanding fluid mixing .",
    "moreover , the additional spatial dimension results in an explosion of geometric complexity , creating more possibilities for transport and mixing structures .",
    "the combination of these factors means that transport and mixing in 3d incompressible flows is a rich source of ongoing research .",
    "central to the dynamical systems approach for conservative periodic systems is the analysis of periodic points , i.e. those that return to their initial position after some number of flow periods . in both 2d and",
    "3d these provide the backbone of the kinematic template which governs transport and mixing .",
    "elliptic points indicate a region of local stability and are generally associated with non - mixing regions , whereas hyperbolic points generate the stretching and folding motions which lead to chaos @xcite . in 2d systems bifurcations of periodic points",
    "play a significant role in transport organization , corresponding to abrupt changes in the topology of coherent structures .",
    "these bifurcations are typically controlled by a single perturbation parameter .",
    "in contrast , periodic points in 3d flows may be found as periodic lines @xcite , a curve of periodic points , and the bifurcations exhibited by 2d systems can arise in 3d systems with the spatial dimension normal to locally 2d transport acting as the perturbation parameter .",
    "this is made clearer in 3d flows which admit a single invariant , such that transport is confined to a nested set of 2d invariant surfaces . in these cases the direction normal to the invariant surfaces can act as a perturbation parameter for the nested set of 2d systems @xcite .",
    "bifurcation points on periodic lines are necessarily of degenerate type ( also known as parabolic type ) , where only shearing of local fluid can occur .",
    "while often overlooked , these points can have a significant effect on global transport @xcite , representing points of bifurcation in local stability and transport topology .    to probe the influence of degenerate points on transport and mixing , we study the bifurcations that occur on periodic lines in a 3d model flow , the 3d reoriented potential mixing ( 3drpm ) flow , that is driven by a periodically reoriented dipole flow .",
    "we demonstrate a type of period - tripling bifurcation that is seen in some 2d systems @xcite and has been observed in a 3d model flow @xcite , but its implications for transport have not been fully explored . in 2d systems",
    "the period - tripling bifurcation occurs as the merging of three period-3 hyperbolic points at a degenerate period-1 point .",
    "unlike period - doubling bifurcations where the period-2 points appear after the bifurcation , the period-3 points exist both before and after the period - tripling bifurcation , such that there is only a single value of the bifurcation parameter where the period-3 points do not exist .",
    "it is for this reason the bifurcation has been described as a ` touch - and - go ' bifurcation @xcite . in 2d this bifurcation results in a reversal in orientation of local lagrangian structures , but the bifurcation itself has little impact on global transport properties . on the other hand , for 3d systems the third spatial direction can act as the bifurcation parameter for locally 2d transport , and period - tripling bifurcations occur where three period-3 hyperbolic lines intersect a period-1 line . these period-1 and period-3 lines are extensive and their manifolds are even more extensive , forming the kinematic template for a large portion of the flow domain .",
    "this entire transport structure is organized by the single bifurcation point , and is observed to destroy invariant tori , create ` sticky ' regions where particles are loosely trapped , create chaotic regions and affects transport in a region of the domain that is vastly more extensive that just the ` neighborhood ' of the bifurcation point .    in standard periodic point analysis",
    ", the eigenvalues of the jacobian determine whether periodic points are elliptic , hyperbolic or degenerate .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors have been used to determine the direction of continuation of periodic lines as well as the directions of contraction and expansion .",
    "we demonstrate an additional property of the eigenvectors in 3d conservative systems , showing that points where the eigenvectors become linearly dependent ( coplanar ) correspond to bifurcation points .",
    "the bifurcations at these points are constrained by the ` poincar index ' , a conserved topological quantity .",
    "we detail two of the possible bifurcations that can occur : saddle  centre and period - doubling bifurcations , with emphasis on the transport barriers and chaotic regions that can be created by saddle ",
    "centre bifurcations . in systems which admit an invariant",
    ", these types of bifurcations occur when the periodic line becomes tangent to the invariant surfaces , providing a simple tool for their detection and analysis . in the absence of an invariant , such as in the 3drpm flow ,",
    "the system still admits local invariants based on local 2d approximation and these bifurcations occur at points where the periodic line becomes tangent to the iso - surfaces of the local invariant .",
    "we call this type of bifurcation a tangent bifurcation @xcite , since they occur at points where periodic lines meet local / global invariants tangentially .",
    "as a model for transport and mixing in 3d fluid flows , in particular porous media flows , we consider a periodically reoriented 3d dipole flow , the 3d reoriented potential mixing ( 3drpm ) flow@xcite .",
    "it is a natural three - dimensional extension of the 2d rpm flow which has been studied in the context of contaminant remediation and heat extraction / injection in groundwater flows @xcite .",
    "a sink / source pair is used to model the extraction / injection of fluid produced by valved well - bores used in groundwater applications@xcite .      a steady dipole flow forms the basis for the time - dependent reoriented flow .",
    "it is driven by a source / sink pair located at @xmath0 . while the open dipole flow in an infinite 2d domain possesses a separating streamline coinciding with the unit circle , the corresponding stream - surface in 3d does not coincide with the unit sphere .",
    "we therefore confine the flow to the unit sphere @xmath1 , using a free - slip boundary condition .",
    "this flow is axisymmetric about the @xmath2-axis , admitting an axisymmetric stokes stream - function @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote cylindrical coordinates .",
    "combining incompressibility with the boundary conditions yields the equations governing the flow potential @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the outward normal to the boundary @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the dirac delta function .",
    "we solved these equations using the method of images @xcite to find an analytic expression for the flow potential @xmath6 . in turn",
    "analytic expressions can be found for the velocity field and the axisymmetric stokes stream - function @xmath3 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the distances from the poles @xmath14 .",
    "contours of @xmath6 and @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stream and potential ] together with the velocity field @xmath15 . both the stream - function @xmath3 and azimuthal angle @xmath16 are invariants of the steady flow , and fluid particles follow streamlines given by intersections of these two isosurfaces .",
    "these streamlines are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stream and potential]b as solid lines on the surfaces .     and velocity field @xmath15 .",
    "( b )  isosurfaces of the axisymmetric stream function @xmath3 . ]",
    "as the steady dipole flow is a potential flow , it is also a darcy flow @xcite , i.e. it can be expressed in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath19 is the permeability of the porous media , and the pressure gradient @xmath20 is obtained by scaling the flow potential @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the steady dipole flow also serves as a model for homogeneous porous media flow , with the dipole mimicking the action of injection and extraction of fluid .    in this study",
    "we create a closed flow by enforcing a reinjection protocol at the source / sink .",
    "we specify that particles that reach the sink are immediately reinjected at the source along the same streamline .",
    "this is an arbitrary choice and other valid reinjection protocols exist ( see lester et al.@xcite for examples of several choices ) but this reinjection choice has the advantage of preserving lagrangian structures during the reinjection process .",
    "here we denote by @xmath21 the solution of the advection equation @xmath22 in the lagrangian frame , describing streamlines as functions of time from an initial condition @xmath23 .",
    "the map @xmath21 satisfies @xmath24 where @xmath23 denotes lagrangian coordinates .",
    "since the velocity @xmath15 is incompressible it follows that the advection map @xmath21 is volume - preserving for each value of @xmath25 .",
    "we use the explicitly volume - preserving integration method of finn and chacn@xcite to numerically solve the advection equation ( [ eq : adv_eqn ] ) .      in the steady dipole flow",
    "passive particles are confined to streamlines of constant azimuth @xmath16 and constant stokes stream - function @xmath3 , and thus the flow can not become chaotic . to create the crossings of streamlines required for chaotic motion",
    "we create a time - dependent flow by periodically reorienting the dipole .",
    "this allows fluid stretching at the dipoles to persist given appropriate flow parameters .",
    "here we only consider the simplest reorientation protocol involving rotation of the dipole about the @xmath26-axis , providing the closest resemblance to the 2d rpm flow .",
    "the dipole is switched on for a time period @xmath27 , then switched off , instantaneously rotated by @xmath28 about the @xmath26-axis , and switched back on .",
    "we non - dimensionalize the reorientation period @xmath27 such that @xmath29 corresponds to the emptying time of the sphere under the steady dipole flow , i.e. the time it takes for all fluid in the sphere to pass through the sink . in this study",
    "we exclusively use a rotation angle of @xmath30 , the dipole positions for this case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transient ] by the blue ( sink ) and red ( source ) points .",
    "the results in this study are generic to all rotation angles of the form @xmath31 with @xmath32 odd , except period-@xmath32 structures replace the period-3 structures that we observe .    .",
    "dipole pairs are labelled according to the number of reorientations of the base flow modulo @xmath33 .",
    "( b )  a typical particle trajectory for the protocol @xmath34 . ]",
    "the velocity field in the time - dependent flow can be approximated@xcite by the inertialess piecewise - steady velocity @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rotation matrix corresponding to rotation through the angle @xmath37 about the @xmath26-axis and @xmath38 is the largest integer less than @xmath39 .",
    "for convenience we track particles in the rotating dipole frame .",
    "rather than rotating the dipole at the end of each reorientation period @xmath27 , we counter - rotate the particles about the @xmath26-axis .",
    "each step of the advection - reorientation cycle can therefore be expressed as @xmath40 this map is the main object of our study , and has identical lagrangian dynamics to the 3drpm flow in the ( fixed ) eulerian frame .",
    "flow symmetries play an important role in the overall organisation of transport structures , including those associated with periodic points and lines .",
    "symmetries of the time - dependent flow can be derived from underlying symmetries of the steady flow and the reorientation protocol .",
    "the steady dipole flow possesses two basic symmetries : axisymmetry about the @xmath2-axis and a reflection reversal symmetry in the @xmath41-plane .",
    "algebraically these can be written respectively as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is reflection in the @xmath41-plane .",
    "these symmetries yield three symmetries for the map @xmath44 .",
    "first , as a special case of the axisymmetry property ( [ eq : steady_sym1 ] ) , the dipole flow is symmetric in the @xmath45-plane , i.e. @xmath46 as a result @xmath44 satisfies @xmath47 and is therefore also symmetric in the @xmath45-plane .",
    "the @xmath45-plane @xmath48 is an invariant surface of the map @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath49 , therefore this symmetry guarantees that the dynamics in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 hemispheres mirror each other . as the @xmath45-plane acts as an impenetrable barrier , dividing @xmath1 in two ,",
    "we need only consider transport in the @xmath50 hemisphere .",
    "similarly , as another case of the axisymmetry property ( [ eq : steady_sym1 ] ) the steady dipole flow is symmetric about the @xmath52-plane @xmath53 this translates to the map @xmath44 as @xmath54 since @xmath55 . therefore changing @xmath28 to @xmath56 results in a reflection through the @xmath52-plane , but does not alter transport dynamics .",
    "this is the 3d extension of the 2d result that for periodically reoriented flows where the base flow has two symmetries that @xmath57 and @xmath56 are equivalent @xcite .",
    "the map @xmath44 also possesses a reflection reversal symmetry , inherited from the reflection reversal symmetry of the dipole flow ( [ eq : steady_sym2 ] ) as follows , @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "direct computation shows that @xmath60 is the map that reflects a point through the plane @xmath61 .",
    "therefore structures in the orbit topology must also evolve symmetrically about this plane .",
    "this has a significant impact on the locations of periodic points , since it constrains all chains of periodic points to be distributed symmetrically about the symmetry plane .",
    "based on the similarity between the 3drpm flow and the 2d rpm flow @xcite and the presence of two invariant surfaces - the @xmath45-plane and the spherical boundary - one might expect that particle transport in general would be confined to 2d surfaces .",
    "however , the 3drpm flow does not admit a global invariant . at low values of @xmath27 ( including those considered in this paper ) particle motion is approximately 2d , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shells]a , b by the approximately hemispherical shape of the poincar sections . however , for all values of @xmath27 there is transport transverse to these surfaces creating 3d motion , as is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shells]c .",
    "this transverse transport has implications for the organization of coherent structures that we explore .",
    "periodic points play a central role in the organization of fluid transport in periodic flows , determining mixing and non - mixing regions .",
    "a period-@xmath32 point of a map @xmath62 satisfies @xmath63 , and the local stability near the periodic point is determined by the eigenvalues of the jacobian @xmath64 evaluated at the periodic point @xcite . for a volume - preserving map , the product of the eigenvalues , @xmath65 is equal to 1 .",
    "if one of the eigenvalues , say @xmath66 , is equal to 1 , and the others are not , then the jacobian is diagonalizable and in an infinitesimally small region near the periodic point there is no transport in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath67 , called the _",
    "null direction_. therefore , in this infinitesimally small region the map @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 corresponds to the coordinate in the direction of the eigenvector @xmath71 @xcite , resulting in a 2d system contained in the plane spanned by the two transverse directions @xmath72 . in this case",
    "the periodic point forms part of a continuous line of periodic points , with the line continuing in the null direction . at each point on the periodic line",
    "the null direction provides a local invariant ( valid in an infinitesimally small region ) according to equation  ( [ eq : ess_2d ] ) ; and conversely if there exists a local invariant in a region containing a periodic point then there is no transport transverse to the local invariant surfaces , providing a null direction . while it is sufficient , it is not necessary for a system to admit a global invariant for there to exist periodic lines , as we see for the 3drpm flow .",
    "there are three possible cases for the eigenvalues if there is a null direction .",
    "first if @xmath73 are both real , then the periodic point is locally unstable and called hyperbolic , fluid contracts along the direction corresponding to @xmath74 and expands along the direction corresponding to @xmath75 . in 2d",
    "the stable manifold associated with a hyperbolic point @xmath76 , @xmath77 , consists of all points that converge to @xmath76 as the number of iterations of the map @xmath62 approaches infinity , i.e. @xmath78 similarly , the unstable manifold consists of points that converge under the map @xmath79 , @xmath80 these structures naturally extend to 3d systems with periodic lines since they can be thought of as a nested set of locally 2d systems according to equation  ( [ eq : ess_2d ] ) .",
    "the 1d manifolds of the nested 2d systems combine to create 2d manifold surfaces @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the disjoint union and @xmath83 is a hyperbolic segment of a periodic line .",
    "an example of this for the 3drpm flow is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : saddle - node_manifolds ] ( multimedia view ) where each curve ( white to dark red ) is the 1d unstable manifold for a single point @xmath84 on the hyperbolic segment of a period-3 line , the union of which form the 2d unstable manifold surface .",
    "similar to 1d manifolds in 2d systems , the manifolds @xmath85 are invariant , and form barriers to fluid transport as they are co - dimension 1 .",
    "the geometry of these manifolds , and their intersections , plays a significant role for the overall transport dynamics .",
    "if the intersecting manifolds belong to the same hyperbolic point , then it is called a homoclinic connection , otherwise it is called a heteroclinic connection .",
    "if the intersection is transverse then they must intersect infinitely many times , creating the stretching and folding of fluid elements necessary for chaos .",
    "conversely , tangent intersections form transport barriers that can confine fluid .",
    "it is possible that a single 2d manifold will have a combination of transverse , tangent , homoclinic and heteroclinic connections , as is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : saddle - node_manifolds ] ( multimedia view ) , where it is seen that for greater @xmath26-values ( closer to white ) the 1d curves loop back to their initial position , forming tangent homoclinic connections , however at a critical value of @xmath26 the 1d manifolds develop a wavy pattern that indicates the presence of transverse connections",
    ".    the second type of periodic point are those that are locally stable , called elliptic points . in this case particles",
    "are rotated about the periodic point , and the non - null eigenvalues of the jacobian form a complex conjugate pair with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "they must therefore be of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the angle of local rotation about the periodic point .",
    "since there is a null direction , the local rotation occurs in the plane spanned by the vectors @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote the real and imaginary parts respectively .",
    "enclosing elliptic segments of periodic lines is an invariant tube that creates a non - mixing region that is topologically distinct to mixing regions , i.e. particles can neither enter nor escape the tube .",
    "the last type of periodic point  called degenerate or parabolic  is locally unstable with the eigenvalues of the jacobian all equal to @xmath93 . in this case",
    "there is local shearing of fluid , but no net rotation or stretching .",
    "these points can come in a number of different forms , resulting in different types of bifurcations of local transport dynamics .",
    "when analysing periodic points in 2d systems , a useful quantity is the ` poincar index ' @xcite , which relates the number and type of periodic points to the topology of the manifold within which they are hosted .",
    "this index can be computed by forming a closed curve around the periodic point and calculating the number of counter - clockwise rotations of the velocity vector in one counter - clockwise traverse of the loop . under this measure",
    ", hyperbolic points have poincar index @xmath94 and elliptic points have poincar index @xmath95 .",
    "the sum of poincar indices is preserved under continuous deformation of a flow , and furthermore is related to the topological genus of the flow domain as per the poincar  hopf theorem .",
    "this provides a constraint on the number and type of periodic points created or annihilated during bifurcation . when considering subdomains of the flow domain , the sum of the poincar indices within the subdomain also remains constant under continuous deformations of the flow , unless a periodic point crosses the boundary of the subdomain .",
    "the poincar index can also be applied to 3d systems with periodic lines , since the existence of a null direction means the system is essentially 2d in an infinitesimal region .",
    "therefore the poincar index of the essentially 2d systems must remain constant as the periodic line is traversed , which can be loosely thought of as a requirement of topological continuity .",
    "we use a numerical approach to find and classify periodic points in the 3drpm flow , with the reorientation angle @xmath30 , the focus is on period-1 and period-3 points since they have a dominant influence on the resulting lagrangian dynamics . for rotation angles of the form",
    "@xmath96 with @xmath32 odd , the period-1 and period-@xmath32 points will play a dominant role , while for even @xmath32 or rotation angles @xmath28 that are incommensurate with @xmath97 ( i.e. @xmath98 is irrational ) , fundamentally different phenomena occur due to the difference in the nature of the degenerate point at the origin of the flow in the limit as @xmath99 @xcite . the reflection reversal symmetry ( [ eq : ref - rev_sym ] )",
    "means all period-1 points must be distributed symmetrically about the symmetry plane @xmath61 . furthermore ,",
    "as the map @xmath44 is the composition of a map @xmath100 that preserves the azimuth @xmath101 , and a rotation @xmath102 , it follows that period-1 points satisfy @xmath103 , and the azimuthal angle of @xmath104 must equal the azimuthal angle of @xmath105 .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath106 and implies that either @xmath61 ( i.e. the point is on the symmetry plane ) or @xmath107 and the point is on the @xmath45-plane . since the @xmath45-plane is invariant and contains all the dipole locations , it is qualitatively similar to the 2d rpm flow , for which it can be shown that period-1 points must lie on the symmetry plane by essentially the same argument as above except using the streamfunction @xmath3 instead of the azimuthal angle @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this also applies to the 3drpm flow , as the streamfunction @xmath3 is conserved by the steady dipole advection @xmath100 , and so a period-1 point must satisfy @xmath108 . therefore , all period-1 points must lie on the symmetry plane @xmath61 .",
    "we also observe that all periodic points in the 3drpm flow with period occur as smooth curves , each intersecting the @xmath45-plane , i.e. we have not found any isolated odd periodic points . therefore we may restrict our initial search for period-1 points to the line given by the intersection of the symmetry plane and the @xmath45-plane , which significantly reduces the search space .",
    "once solutions to @xmath109 have been found , we compute the jacobian to find the null direction and search for new periodic points a fixed distance @xmath11 away in the neighbourhood of the null direction . once the full line has been found we again use the jacobian to classify periodic points using the associated eigenvalues .    .",

    "considering the impact that tangent bifurcations have on transport , we primarily focus on saddle  centre bifurcations as they provide a complete picture for the bifurcation sequence that occurs near period - tripling bifurcations in the 3drpm flow . at a critical value @xmath170 , the period-3 lines associated with the period - tripling bifurcation undergo saddle  centre bifurcations , dividing them into elliptic and hyperbolic segments , as seen in figs .

    "fig : p1_e_p3_h]b , [ fig : saddle - node_manifolds ] ( multimedia view ) . while not the focus of this study , period - doubling bifurcations are equally important for transport .",
    "cascades of period - doubling bifurcations are a common route to chaos in 2d systems @xcite and we expect similar behaviour for 3d systems , though the chaos may be restricted to approximately 2d structures .",
    "saddle  centre bifurcations are commonly found in 2d conservative systems , resulting in the creation of a pair of periodic points , one elliptic and one hyperbolic .",

    "thus saddle  centre bifurcations in 3d conservative systems create elliptic and hyperbolic segments of periodic lines .",
    "enclosing the elliptic segment is an invariant tube , yielding an isolated non - mixing region . at the saddle  centre bifurcation point the elliptic segment and",
    "hence the invariant tube converges to a point , creating a ` cap ' for the tube .",
    "for the 3drpm flow the cap is formed by the tangent connections of the 2d stable and unstable manifolds @xmath85 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : saddle - node_manifolds ] ( multimedia view ) .",

    "[ fig : saddle - node_manifolds]d ( multimedia view ) .",
    "this transverse intersection means the 2d manifolds no longer form the outer boundary of the invariant tube , but rather there is a bounding ergodic region .",
    "we expect this phenomenon to be generic , as the distance from the bifurcation point in the transverse direction @xmath177 to the essentially 2d transport can act as a perturbation parameter .",
    "therefore the framework of tangent bifurcations , in particular the restrictions imposed by conservation of the poincar index , provide a simple diagnostic tool for the analysis of periodic lines .",
    "for each periodicity there exists at least one distinct type of tangent bifurcation , e.g. saddle  centre bifurcations occur when a period-1 line becomes tangent , and period - doubling bifurcations occur when a period-2 line becomes tangent .",
    "these different types of tangent bifurcations can have vastly different impacts on transport .",
    "for instance , saddle  centre bifurcations yield both isolated non - mixing regions and the possibility of locally chaotic regions , whereas period - doubling bifurcations can create regions of chaos via period - doubling cascades , though possibly only two - dimensional chaos .",
    "degenerate points play a more important role than generally supposed in the organization of transport structures , representing bifurcations in local stability and transport topology . typically in 2d systems",
    "there exists a perturbation parameter that controls bifurcations , but in 3d the extra dimension may act as the perturbation parameter for locally 2d transport . in 3d systems with periodic lines rather than isolated periodic points ,",
    "the null direction associated with the periodic line acts as a local invariant producing bifurcations in the essentially 2d transport .",
    "we have studied the bifurcations that occur in a 3d model fluid flow , the 3drpm flow , which are generic to a wide range of 3d conservative systems .",
    "period - tripling bifurcations result in a local reversal of some coherent structures and are generic to @xmath123 resonances , i.e. when the local elliptic rotation angle @xmath89 is @xmath121 . in the 3drpm flow with",
    "reorientation angle @xmath30 these bifurcations occur at every intersection of period-1 lines with the @xmath26-axis , and for reorientation angles of the form @xmath180 with @xmath32 odd similar bifurcations occur .",
    "rather than period - tripling they are @xmath32-tupling bifurcations , occurring at the intersections of @xmath32 period-@xmath32 hyperbolic periodic lines and an elliptic period-1 line .",
    "even though each period - tripling bifurcation results in a single unstable point on an elliptic periodic line , it also controls the associated period-3 hyperbolic lines whose manifolds play a significant role in transport organization , destroying tori , creating ` sticky ' regions and creating wide - spread chaos . since the nature of the manifold intersections , either tangential or transverse , can depend on the position along the periodic lines , combinations of chaotic , sticky , and confining regions can occur in a single 3d flow , leading to complex 3d transport .",
    "also observed in the 3drpm flow are saddle  centre and period - doubling bifurcations ; the former creating barriers to transport and the possibility of chaos , and the latter being a common route to chaos in 2d systems .",
    "both of these types of bifurcation can be categorized as tangent bifurcations , which occur when periodic lines are tangent to local / global invariant surfaces .",
    "these are particularly easy to detect in systems with global invariants , and can also be detected by considering the eigenvectors associated with the periodic line when there is no global invariant , such as in the 3drpm flow .",
    "the restrictions imposed by conservation of the poincar index place constraints on the types of possible tangent bifurcations , and can also be used to determine properties such as stability and the existence of higher or lower order periodic points .",
    "the period - tripling bifurcations have also been studied in 2d systems in the context of so - called ` twistless - tori'@xcite , i.e. invariant tori surrounding elliptic periodic points where the rotation number does not vary monotonically . these twistless - tori produce a number of interesting bifurcation phenomena that are not predicted by the kam - theorem , such as reconnection bifurcations where chains of periodic points merge and annihilate each other .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have shown that twistless - tori generically appear as a result of period - tripling bifurcations in 2d systems , and our recent results suggest that similar phenomena are observed in 3d systems featuring period - tripling bifurcations , such as the 3drpm flow",

    "<S> we consider the ramifications of the two types of degenerate periodic points that occur in a model 3d fluid flow . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) period - tripling bifurcations occur when the local rotation angle associated with elliptic points is reversed , creating a reversal in the orientation of associated lagrangian structures . </S>",
    "<S> even though a single unstable point is created , the bifurcation in local stability has a large influence on local transport and the global arrangement of manifolds as the unstable degenerate point has three stable and three unstable directions , similar to hyperbolic points , and occurs at the intersection of three hyperbolic periodic lines . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of period - tripling bifurcation points indicates regions of both chaos and confinement , with the extent of each depending on the nature of the associated manifold intersections . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the second type of bifurcation occurs when periodic lines become tangent to local or global invariant surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this bifurcation creates both saddle  centre bifurcations which can create both chaotic and stable regions , and period - doubling bifurcations which are a common route to chaos in 2d systems . </S>",
    "<S> we provide conditions for the occurrence of these tangent bifurcations in 3d conservative systems , as well as constraints on the possible types of tangent bifurcation that can occur based on topological considerations . </S>",

    "<S> locally stable ( elliptic ) periodic points indicate regions of non - mixing , whereas locally unstable ( hyperbolic ) periodic points are necessary for chaos and mixing . there is a third type of periodic point , known as a degenerate ( parabolic ) point , for which the only local deformation of fluid elements is shear . </S>",
    "<S> these points are often overlooked but also play an important role as they are on the brink of the stable / unstable classification and indicate abrupt changes in local stability . </S>",
