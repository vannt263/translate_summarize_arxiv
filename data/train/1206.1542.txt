    ", the ensuing nuclear excitation energies may well amount to several @xmath0 mev .",
    "depending on the time scale on which the excitation takes place and on the specific nucleon - nucleon interaction rates , collective excitations may be induced , or a compound nucleus be formed  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical treatment of the latter process along the lines of precompound reaction models requires the knowledge of the total level density , of the densities of @xmath1particle @xmath2hole states , and of the density of accessible states for particle / hole numbers and/or excitation energies that go far beyond what has been considered until now .",
    "that applies not only to the target nucleus but also to all daughter nuclei populated by induced particle emission during the interaction time of the laser pulse .    the standard approach to level densities goes back to the pioneering work of bethe  @xcite who calculated the total level density as a function of excitation energy with the help of the darwin  fowler method .",
    "basically the same method was used in many of the later works  @xcite dealing with the density of @xmath1particle @xmath2hole states and related quantities . a beautiful review",
    "is given in ref .",
    "the darwin  fowler method yields analytical expressions involving contour integrals . their evaluation ,",
    "although straightforward , becomes increasingly involved with increasing numbers of particles and holes and/or increasing excitation energy .",
    "the same is true for refs .  @xcite that account for the exclusion principle by explicit counting .",
    "moreover , without explicit numerical calculation it is not possible within these approaches to establish general properties of particle  hole densities like the overall dependence on excitation energy and/or particle  hole number .",
    "more recent works use a static  path approximation ( refs .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite avoids contour integrals and determines ( again numerically ) the level densities directly as coefficients of polynomials .",
    "the order of these rises rapidly , too , with energy and particle / hole number . in none of these approaches does it seem possible to deal with the enormously large values of the various densities attained for medium  weight and heavy nuclei at excitation energies of several @xmath0 mev in a practicable way .",
    "that is why we develop a different approach in the present work .    in this letter we present an analytical approximation to the global dependence of partial and total level densities that takes full account of the exclusion principle , that is valid for a finite number of single  particle states , and that holds for all excitation energies and particle / hole numbers .",
    "we prove analytically that the level density for particles or holes is for a constant  spacing model asymptotically gaussian .",
    "we improve on the gaussian using analytical results for the low moments of the distribution higher than the second .",
    "comparison with numerical results shows that the resulting sixth  moment approximation is very precise except near the boundaries of the spectrum ( where numerical evaluation is easy ) .",
    "hole densities follow by convolution .",
    "the attained analytical form of the global dependence of level densities on excitation energy and particle number extends our understanding of characteristic nuclear properties into uncharted territory .",
    "moreover , we expect our results to be an indispensable tool in the calculation of laser  induced nuclear reactions mentioned in the first paragraph .",
    "we calculate the various densities in the framework of a constant  spacing model for spinless non  interacting fermions . to justify our choice we consider by way of example the partial level density @xmath3 for @xmath1 particles and @xmath1 holes , a function of excitation energy @xmath4 , total spin @xmath5 , and parity @xmath6 , for a system of non  interacting fermions in three dimensions . for other densities",

    "we note that in preequilibrium theories , the interactions between fermions neglected here are taken into account as agents for equilibration . in our model ,",
    "the non  interacting fermions are distributed over a set of single  particle states .",
    "each subshell with spin @xmath11 of the three - dimensional shell model contributes @xmath12 states to the set . for large excitation energy or particle  hole numbers",
    ", we must take into account the exclusion principle exactly .",
    "it is equally important to account for the finite binding energy of particles and for the finite size of the energy interval available for holes .",
    "both strongly affect the various level densities at large excitation energies .",
