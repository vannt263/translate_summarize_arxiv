    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are a key prediction of einstein s theory of general relativity and their existence has been supported through timing measurements of the orbital decay of the hulse - taylor binary system b1913@xmath016 @xcite .",
    "many experiments aim to detect these waves directly through the measurement of light travel changes between objects .",
    "complementary to interferometer - based gw detection experiments like ligo , pulsar timing is sensitive to nanohertz frequency gws . the change in light travel time between the earth and a pulsar due to a passing",
    "gw results in a delay in the time of arrival ( toa ) of pulses @xcite . given a timing model that accounts for parameters such as pulsar period , period derivative , position , proper motion and other orbital parameters , we calculate residuals , or the differences between measured and model toas",
    ".    these residuals will contain the signatures of gravitational waves .",
    "a stochastic background of gws can be detected through searching for a correlation with angular separation in the timing residuals of an array of pulsars @xcite . in order to detect the background due to supermassive black hole binaries , over 40 msps with root - mean - square ( rms ) timing residuals of less than 100 ns",
    "are likely required @xcite .",
    "currently over 40 millisecond pulsars are being timed by the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves ( nanograv ) , with rms timing residuals of nearly all pulsars at the sub - microsecond level @xcite .",
    "in addition to gws , other effects such as interstellar medium ( ism ) propagation and rotational irregularities will affect the arrival times of pulses .",
    "fortunately , ism effects are chromatic and therefore multi - frequency observations can be used to at least partially correct for these variations .    electromagnetic radiation from pulsars experiences delays as it travels through the ionized plasma of the ism .",
    "the three prominent known effects are ( 1 ) dispersion , caused by the change in radio wave speed due to refraction , ( 2 ) scattering and scintillation , due to inhomogeneities in the medium @xcite which results in a random interference pattern on the observer plane , and ( 3 ) faraday rotation , which is rotation of the plane of linear polarization due to a magnetized plasma .",
    "all timing algorithms correct for time - variable dispersion to high accuracies @xcite .",
    "we do not expect faraday rotation to result in toa fluctuations if polarization calibration is done correctly . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on removal of scattering effects , which are more difficult to correct but can cause sizeable fluctuations in toas .",
    "the distribution of electron density in the ism can be described by the spatial spectrum of turbulence , or the spectral density , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the wave number , @xmath3 is the spectral exponent and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the inner and outer scales respectively @xcite .",
    "for @xmath6 it is approximated by a power law @xmath7 , where @xmath8 for a kolmogorov medium , which describes a cascade of kinetic energy in the interstellar plasma @xcite .",
    "this generally describes most pulsar lines of sight @xcite , even though inconsistencies may exist for others @xcite .",
    "the phase structure function , or the mean square phase difference between neighboring ray paths , takes the form of a power law for @xmath9 . for steeper spectra",
    ", the phase structure function will be a square law @xcite .",
    "the scattering process delays the pulse toa due to refraction and multipath propagation .",
    "while the most prominent scattering effect is pulse broadening due to multipath propagation , other effects such as angle of arrival variations also contribute to the pulse delay .",
    "scintillation causes the pulse to appear brighter at certain times and frequencies , with characteristic scales determined by the distance to the pulsar , its velocity , the properties of the ism along the line of sight , and the observing frequency ; for a review of these effects see @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : toymodel ] shows a schematic picture of how these various delays affect the signal .",
    "the long - term goal of pulsar timing is to correct for delays due to other intrinsic and extrinsic effects such that only the gw signature remains in the residuals .",
    "ism delays are observing frequency ( @xmath10 ) dependent , with dispersion and pulse broadening scaling as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "therefore pulse broadening , which is indicative of large amounts of scattering , is most prominent at low frequencies .",
    "in addition to the frequency dependence , pulse broadening has been empirically determined to have a roughly dm@xmath14 dependence @xcite , where dm is the dispersion measure , or the integral of the electron density along the line of sight .",
    "scattering delays are also expected to vary significantly with time due to the relative motion of the pulsar and the earth changing the line - of - sight path through the ionized ism . @xcite",
    "used secondary spectra of pulsar b1737@xmath013 to measure scattering delays between 0.2 and 2.2 @xmath15s over @xmath16270 days of observation at a radio frequency of 1400 mhz .",
    "@xcite showed that scattering delays vary between @xmath17 and @xmath18 us over @xmath19 years for b1937@xmath021 at 327 mhz .    correcting for ism scattering delays may be important for detecting gw signatures in our data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the average spectral index of millisecond pulsars is @xmath161.4 @xcite , meaning that these objects are @xmath168 times brighter at 430 mhz than at 1400 mhz .",
    "the msps used in current timing experiments are selected to be nearby ( i.e. @xmath20few kpc ) and are generally timed at high frequencies ( @xmath21800 mhz ) in order to mitigate these dispersion and scattering effects . the ability to correct for the effects of scattering could improve timing at lower frequencies , resulting in increased signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "finally , understanding the scattering phenomenon will lead to better quantifying the galactic models for free electron density @xcite and the distribution of scattering material along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed to estimate scattering timescales .",
    "these methods assume that the ism acts as a linear filter with a voltage impulse response function ( irf ) , which is convolved with the intrinsic pulsar signal to produce the observed pulse . for scattering by a single thin screen with a square law structure function @xcite ,",
    "the ensemble - average irf is a one - sided exponential .",
    "@xcite showed that a descattered pulse can be restored by fitting the observed profile to a gaussian convolved with a one - sided exponential function .",
    "however , these methods usually require assumptions about the functional form of the irf , which is dependent on the spatial distribution and inhomogeneity spectrum of the scattering medium @xcite .",
    "the scattering times can also be estimated from the auto correlation function ( acf ) of the pulsar dynamic spectra or from the cumulative delay function from pulsar secondary spectra ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , these methods are limited by large uncertainties and a finite number of scintles within the observing bandwidth and observation time .",
    "another method , which is based on a clean algorithm , tests various irf types to get the best fit , and requires assumptions about the irf form @xcite .",
    "this method can estimate irfs when scattering delays are large and cause recognizable changes to pulse shapes , but is not optimal in the case of small delays .",
    "more recently @xcite showed that scattering is anti - correlated with pulse power and the toa fluctuations can be reduced by @xmath1625% by removing those correlated components .",
    "unlike these methods , cyclic spectroscopy ( cs ) directly accounts for phase changes of the electric field , thereby allowing a more accurate description of ism effects .",
    "the phase of the ism transfer function , which is the frequency - domain representation of the irf , contains information about pulse broadening due to ism delays . recovering the phase information of the electric field to reconstruct the irf has been successfully applied to pulsar dynamic spectra @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the deconvolution technique of cs , introduced in @xcite and further developed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wds13 ) .",
    "this method allows determination of the phase of a periodic signal , which can then be used to calculate scattering delays .",
    "this paper is a step in an ongoing analysis of the efficiency of cs for scattering delay correction . by means of a simulation that includes a realistic signal model ,",
    "we show that cs can be used to accurately reconstruct the irf for an achievable signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we introduce the theoretical formulation in section  2 ; in section  3 we present the details and results of our simulation ; and in section  4 we discuss future applications and the advantages of using cs over other methods .",
    "we begin by expressing the electric field vector as a function of time @xmath22 and position @xmath23 , as @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the wave vector and angular frequency of the wave respectively . for a wave with frequency @xmath27 , traveling in a medium with refractive index @xmath15 at a speed @xmath28 ,",
    "the wave vector is @xmath29 .",
    "frequency - dependent refractive index fluctuations in the medium cause a change in @xmath30 , which corresponds to a change in the phase of the wave . upon encountering a scattering region , in this case a thin screen of thickness @xmath31 , the phase of the wave changes by an amount @xmath32 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "for a wave propagating in the @xmath33 direction , the phase of the wavefront becomes a function of x and y after passing through the phase screen .",
    "the phase changes will vary randomly along the wavefront , and hence the final phase changes will be randomly distributed .",
    "the final phase ` corrugation ' , causes angular broadening of the propagating radiation .",
    "additionally , electron density variations that are large compared to the broadened `` image '' of the pulsar projected on the scattering screen will result in refractive effects .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "the bent wavefront arrives later than the unscattered one , resulting in a scattering response that approximates an exponentially - decaying function in long - term averages @xcite .    in general , pulsar ( e - field ) signals can be considered to be amplitude - modulated complex gaussian noise @xcite so that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a real - valued , positive definite pulse modulation function and @xmath36 is complex gaussian white noise .",
    "the interstellar medium propagation can be modeled as a linear filter with a voltage irf @xmath37 and a corresponding transfer function @xmath38 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are a fourier transform pair . for an intrinsic pulsar voltage ( e - field ) signal @xmath39 ,",

    "for a true cyclostationary signal to have non - zero @xmath49 , the cyclic frequency @xmath44 must take on discrete values such that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the pulse period .",
    "the cyclic spectrum can be further expanded as @xmath52 [ eq : eq3 ] assuming that the pulsar flux within the band is @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the @xmath55 complex fourier coefficient of the fourier transform of the intensity modulation function @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , we can express the spectrum of the intrinsic signal as @xmath58 therefore , the cyclic spectrum reduces to @xmath59 the deconvolution algorithm in @xcite and wds13 models the cyclic spectrum with an initial input of a delta function transfer function @xmath38 and iterative fitting to arrive at the recovered irf .",
    "we use the publicly available python version of this algorithm .",
    "the irfs are calculated from the cyclic spectra via a least square minimization of the difference between the modeled and actual cyclic spectrum .",

    "many iterations can be used to refine the template .",
    "in this section we use simulated data to test the effectiveness of the deconvolution algorithm in recovering irfs and the effect of scatter correction for pulsar timing .",
    "we first consider scattering by a thin screen and present the effect of scatter correction in subsection 3.1 and the result of including non - scattering delays such as gws in subsection 3.2 .",

    "figure  [ fig : delays_thick_wds ] we show the uncorrected and scatter corrected toas over 25 days and a mean scattering timescale of 5 @xmath15s in the thick screen scenario . for profiles containing a mean scattering delay of 5 @xmath15s and an rms variation of @xmath161  @xmath15s , the rms of uncorrected residuals is @xmath161.8  @xmath15s and cs - correction technique reduced the rms variation to @xmath16580 ns .     for a thick screen given by equation  [ eq : thick_screen_eq ] constructed from a cyclic spectrum ( red curve ) for an input scattering timescale of 5 @xmath15s . for this realization ,",
    "the scattering timescale estimated using the fitting technique is 10.6 @xmath15s .",
    "the input function is shown by the black curve .",
    "the best fitting one - sided exponential function is shown by the blue curve .",
    "the middle plots are smoothed versions of the top plots and the bottom plot shows the residual between the input and recovered irfs .",
    ", width=336 ]          single pulses from some millisecond pulsars show random fluctuations in arrival phase which can be of the order of a pulse width .",
    "this is referred to as pulse phase jitter @xcite . while pulses from psr b1937@xmath021 show jitter that contributes to a toa uncertainty of 19 ns @xcite , giant pulses from this object also exhibit jitter @xcite .",
    "psrs j1713@xmath00747 and j0437@xmath924715 , precisely timed pta pulsars ( epoch averaged rms of 30 ns @xcite and 75 ns @xcite ) , are among the msps that show significant phase jitter that affect the toa errors at levels of 65 ns and 105 ns @xcite respectively . in order to test the effect of phase jitter on the cs recovery of irfs , we simulated pulsar emission with jitter where the pulse phase fluctuations were drawn from a gaussian random distribution , consistent with observations of jitter in normal pulsars .",
    "we have conducted this analysis for four values of the jitter parameter @xmath93 , which is defined as @xmath94 @xcite , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the widths of single pulses and average profile respectively .",
    "single pulses with widths 40 , 30 , 20 , and 10 @xmath15s and a scattering timescale of 5 @xmath15s were shifted in pulse phase from the center of the pulse to form a jittered average profile of width @xmath1640 @xmath15s .",
    "these correspond to jitter parameter values of 0.00 , 0.66 , 0.87 and 0.97 .",
    "we have also computed the effect of scatter correction on jittered average profiles on 25 epochs for the above four jitter parameter values .",
    "we find that the rms correction ratio ( @xmath97 ) increases from 0.3 to 1.3 as the jitter parameter increases from 0.0 to 0.97 .",
    "given the fact that real msp signals show small amounts of jitter @xcite , the effect of phase jitter on impulse response recovery should be minimal .",
    "we have used simulations to show that the cs method , based on electric field phase information , can be used to accurately recover the complex voltage irf , @xmath37 , under realizable conditions for the brightest pulsars observed with 100-m class radio telescopes , for which the s / n we have used here is applicable . for profiles containing a mean scattering delay of 5 @xmath15s and an rms variation of @xmath161  @xmath15s , the cs - correction technique reduced the rms variation to 407 ns .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath162.5 decrease in the residual rms .",
    "we also find that the ratio of pre to post scatter - correction rms improves with increasing profile s / n .",
    "this implies that cs scatter correction is , not surprisingly , more effective on bright pulsars .",
    "the finite s / n of the simulation sets a lower limit on the efficacy of the cs correction scheme . in the presence of a gw signal , in order to separate the scattering delays from the gw delays , it becomes necessary to fit a one - sided exponential function to the recovered irf , in order to locate the rising edge of the function , which gives the scatter corrected toa .",
    "real pulsar signals will contain other delays , such as those due to refraction , that will cause @xmath80 of equation  [ eq : ht ] to be chromatic .    out of the msps that exhibit jitter , jitter parameters of @xmath16 0.20.5 for giant pulses of b1937@xmath021 @xcite , 0.4 for pulses of j1713@xmath98747 @xcite , and 0.07 for pulses of j0437@xmath924715 @xcite have been observed .",
    "our results show that one - sided exponential irfs with the expected timescales can be recovered from pulse profiles that show these amounts of jitter using this technique",
    ". therefore the effect of pulse phase jitter on irf recovery should be negligible .",
    "it is important to note that the improvement in timing precision that we demonstrate is solely due to scattering time delay correction and not to pulse sharpening through the removal of scatter broadening .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not require prior assumptions of the shape of the irf or the pulse shape , unlike the previously proposed irf retrieval techniques that rely on prior assumptions of either one or both entities .",
    "the strong frequency dependence of scattering can help distinguish between ism effects and other achromatic effects when multi - frequency observations are made .",
    "this is vital because one of the key applications for this technique is in the effort to detect gws with pulsar timing .",
    "since the gw signal is achromatic , we must be careful to prevent or minimize its inclusion in any correction of toas that is done in a dedicated pta effort .",
    "this problem is not limited to the irf estimation technique presented here .",
    "it is inherent in separating the effects of ism and other frequency - dependent delays from the achromatic signal of interest . following the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", our simulation takes a next step toward developing a production - quality chromatic correction technique .",
    "as we have emphasized , the cs - technique produces a irf _ function _ from which we can extract a toa .",
    "this provides the platform for a fuller multi - frequency analysis of the timing information embodied in @xmath99 which should certainly improve our ability to separate chromatic and achromatic influences on the pulse arrival time .",
    "the simulated pulsar signal is scatter - broadened amplitude - modulated noise and includes scintillation effects .",
    "we have limited the analysis to this case in order to demonstrate the effect of scatter correction on improving timing residuals without the complications of other smaller effects .",
    "this technique can be applied to real pulsar signals whose phase information is preserved when recorded with a baseband setup . however , when applying this to real pulsar data we note that the scintle size , phase connection between scintles , and signal - to - noise ratio may need to be accounted for . furthermore , when implementing on real pulsar data , the cyclic spectra calculated at radio frequencies @xmath10 within a bandwidth of @xmath100 will be valid within a region described by @xmath101 ( see * ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "cyclic spectroscopy has so far been tested only on pulsar b1937@xmath021 @xcite , a bright pulsar which exhibits pronounced dm variations and pulse broadening variations @xcite ; the possibility of achieving a descattered pulse profile is shown in that paper .",
    "scattering correction , when fully achieved , will allow higher precision pulsar timing , which will facilitate gw detection efforts using pulsars",
    ". it will also increase the number of msps able to be included in a pulsar timing array and will improve timing at lower frequencies .",
    "this should also improve timing of pulsars if found in the galactic center region , currently limited due to scattering effects from turbulent plasma in these dense regions .",
