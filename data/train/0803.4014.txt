    "electronic transport through quantum rings structures has become the subject of active research during the last years .",
    "interesting quantum interference phenomena have been predicted and measured in these mesoscopic systems in presence of a magnetic flux , such as the aharonov - bohm oscillations in the conductance , persistent currents@xcite and fano antiresonances @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in understanding the manner in which the unique properties of nanostructures may be exploited in spintronic devices , which utilize the spin degree of freedom of the electron as the basis of their operation  @xcite .",
    "a natural feature of these devices is the direct connection between their conductance and their quantum - mechanical transmission properties , which may allow their use as an all - electrical means for generating and detecting spin polarized distributions of carriers .",
    "for instance , recently son et al.song described how a spin filter may be realized in open - quantum dot system , by exploiting the fano resonances that occur in their transmission . in a quantum dot in which the spin degeneracy of carrier is lifted , they showed that the fano effect may be used as an effective means to generate spin polarization of transmitted carriers , and that electrical detection of the resulting polarization should be possible .",
    "this idea was extended to side attached quantum rings . in ref .",
    "( ) shelykh et .",
    "analyze the conductance of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) , one - dimensional quantum ring touching a quantum wire .",
    "they found that the period of the ab oscillations strongly depends on the chemical potential and the rashba coupling parameter .",
    "the dependence of the conductance on the carrier s energy reveals the fano antiresonances . on the other hand , bruder et .",
    "al.@xcite introduce a spin filter based on spin - resolved fano resonances due to spin - split levels in a quantum ring side coupled to a quantum wire .",
    "spin - orbit coupling inside the quantum ring , together with external magnetic fields , induces spin splitting , and the fano resonances due to the spin - split levels result in perfect or considerable suppression of the transport of either spin direction .",
    "they found that the coulomb interaction in the quantum ring enhances the spin - filter operation by widening the separation between dips in the conductance for different spins and by allowing perfect blocking for one spin direction and perfect transmission for the other .",
    "in this paper we study the two ring side - coupled to a quantum wire in presence of magnetic flux and rashba spin - orbit interaction , as shown schematically in fig .  [ fig1 ] . in a previous paper ( ref )",
    "we investigate the conductance and the persistent current of two mesoscopic quantum ring attached to a perfect quantum wire in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we show that the system develops an oscillating band with resonances ( perfect transmission ) and antiresonances ( perfect reflection ) .",
    "in addition , we found persistent current magnification in the rings due to the dicke effect in the rings when the magnetic flux difference is an integer number of the quantum of flux .",
    "the dicke effect in optics takes place in the spontaneous emission of a pair of atoms radiating a photon with a wave length much larger than the separation between them .",
    "@xcite the luminescence spectrum is characterized by a narrow and a broad peak , associated with long and short - lived states , respectively .",
    "now , we show that by using the fano and dicke effects this system can be used as an efficient spin - filter even for small spin orbit interaction and small values of magnetic flux .",
    "we find that the spin - polarization dependence for this system is much more sensitive to magnetic flux and spin - orbit interaction than the case with only one ring side - coupled to the quantum wire .",

    "the wire site - energy is assumed equal to zero and the hopping energies for wire and rings are taken to be equal to @xmath23 , whereas @xmath24 couples both systems .    within the described model the conductance can be calculated by means of a dyson equation for the green s function .",

    "in the linear response approach it can be written in term of the green s function of the contact by :    @xmath33 = \\frac{1}{1+\\gamma ^{2}% \\left [ \\sum\\limits_{\\beta } a_{\\mu } ^{\\beta } ( \\omega ) \\right ] ^{2}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 .",

    "we introduce the weighted spin polarization as    @xmath35    notice that this definition takes into account not only the relative fraction of one of the spins , but also the contribution of those spins to the electric current .",
    "in other words , we will require that not only the first term of the right - hand side of  ( [ wsp ] ) to be of order of unity , but also the transmission probability @xmath36 .",
