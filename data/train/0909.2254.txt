    "because of their intrinsically faint luminosities , white dwarfs are relatively hard to study spectroscopically .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the number of da to non - da white dwarfs is a function of temperature ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "because a given white dwarf  will be born with a high temperature , and subsequently cool through the entire range of observed white - dwarf temperatures , the implication of this observation is that white dwarfs can change their spectral type multiple times throughout their evolution .",
    "this means that , unlike main - sequence stars , white dwarfs that are physically similar can have very different spectra , or vice - versa .",
    "the dominant physical variable that controls the spectral type of a white dwarf  during its evolution is the mass of the very - thin atmosphere layer .",
    "@xcite outline the presumed multiple evolutionary sequences of white dwarfs with `` thick '' and `` thin '' hydrogen envelopes , with envelope masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7  respectively .",
    "stars with thick hydrogen layers have atmospheres rich in hydrogen throughout their evolution , and will always appear as das ( exhibiting h i lines ) .",
    "white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers have a much more complicated evolution , and may at varying times have atmospheres dominated by either hydrogen or helium .",
    "these white dwarfs may be born with da or do ( exhibiting he ii lines ) spectral types .",
    "as the stars cool , helium ions will recombine , and the dos will transform into dbs ( exhibiting he i lines ) .    at temperatures between @xmath8@xmath9",
    "k , das far outnumber dbs .",
    "in fact , from @xmath8@xmath10 k there is the so - called `` db gap '' @xcite .",
    "this temperature range was , until recently , completely devoid of db stars . with dr4 ,",
    "the sdss had accumulated @xmath11 white - dwarf spectra , and within this sample , approximately 10 db white dwarfs were found in this temperature range @xcite . while this temperature range is no longer strictly a `` gap '' , it is still true that the da / db ratio is approximately 2.5 times greater at @xmath8 k than it is at @xmath12 k. this implies that an atmospheric transformation takes place in approximately 10% of das as they cool through this range @xcite .    below @xmath8",
    "k , a helium convection zone is established .",
    "convective velocities can become high enough to overshoot , and mix the helium layer with the hydrogen atmosphere , converting a type da to a type db .",
    "this occurs in @xmath13% of white dwarfs in this temperature range in the field @xcite .    for temperatures lower than @xmath14",
    "k , the situation becomes even more complicated and uncertain @xcite . at these low temperatures the variety of spectral types increases , but in the non - da gap ( @xmath14@xmath15 k ) non - da white dwarfs have yet to be observed .",
    "as white dwarfs cool below @xmath16 k , neither hydrogen nor helium lines are excited , and the resultant spectrum is almost featureless , leading to the dc spectral classification .",
    "even more rare are white dwarfs showing metal lines .",
    "these are the dqs , for those showing carbon features , and the dzs , for other atomic species .",
    "finally , dp and dh white dwarfs show evidence of having polarized and non - polarized magnetic fields respectively .",
    "prior to the year 2000 , the spectra of cluster white dwarfs had been obtained in a piecemeal fashion  only one or two stars would be studied in each cluster , typically by different authors .",
    "the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) open star cluster survey changed this .",
    "the idea behind this survey was to obtain high - quality , wide - field images of many open clusters .",
    "the rich clusters ( i.e. , those with well - populated white dwarf cooling sequences ) could then be identified , and followed up spectroscopically .",
    "previously , when spectral types were obtained for only several white dwarfs at a time , the absence of a particular spectral type was neither particularly surprising nor interesting .",
    "@xcite reported 21 spectral identifications in ngc 2099 .",
    "assuming the same da / db ratio observed in the field for this temperature range ( @xmath0 k@xmath8 k ) held for this cluster , it was expected that several db white dwarfs would be found .",
    "contrary to expectations , no db white dwarfs were found . according to @xcite , finding",
    "a db / da ratio of 0/21 would occur approximately 2% of the time simply due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "this finding prompted @xcite to examine all white dwarf spectral identifications in young open clusters .",
    "these cluster were all very young .",
    "in fact , ngc 2099 was the oldest of the sample .",
    "because turn - off mass ( and therefore white - dwarf mass ) is inversely correlated with cluster age , all of the white dwarfs in this sample are very massive .",
    "of all the 65 white dwarfs that had been spectroscopically identified in young open clusters at that point , all were of type da .",
    "this had a vanishingly small chance of occurring due to a statistical fluctuation under the hypothesis that the same da / db ratio held as in the field .",
    "an obvious explanation for this observation was not apparent .",
    "one early explanation was the re - accretion of residual intra - cluster gas in open clusters . however , this explanation appeared not to hold up on closer examination .",
    "the escape velocity in open clusters is typically very low ( @xmath17 ) , and gas ejected by stellar winds ( @xmath18 ) would be expected to quickly escape .",
    "it was found that the accretion rate of intra - cluster gas in open clusters should be no greater than that of the ism in the disk .",
    "@xcite postulated an explanation based on the mass of the white dwarfs . because ngc 2099 is a young cluster , the young white dwarfs are high mass ( @xmath19 @xmath7 ) compared to the average disk population ( @xmath20 @xmath7 ) .",
    "he convection is inhibited in high - mass white dwarfs , and therefore even white dwarfs with thin hydrogen atmospheres would remain type da in this temperature range .",
    "globular clusters are the oldest galactic stellar population , and should therefore create the lowest - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath21 @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is of interest to determine whether the same paucity of db white dwarfs exists in globular clusters .",
    "recent observations suggest that the same paucity is indeed there . in 2004",
    ", @xcite obtained spectra of @xmath22 white dwarfs in ngc 6752 and another @xmath23 in ngc 6397 , all of which were found to be type da . assuming that the da / db ratio is the same as in the field , the chance of finding no db white dwarfs given the number observed in ngc 6752 and ngc 6397 is 0.35 and 0.43 respectively .",
    "the current paper follows from an ultra - deep _ hst / wfpc2 _ study of the nearest globular cluster , messier 4 ( ngc 6121 ) by @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs identified in this photometry were followed up with the _ gemini / gmos _ and _ keck / lris _ spectrographs .",
    "the primary science goal of the spectrographic follow - up was the determination of the masses of the white dwarfs ( see kalirai et al .",
    "while spectroscopic masses were determined for only a subset of the observed white dwarfs due to signal - to - noise ratio constraints , the spectral types were determined for 24 of the 25 candidates with a high - probability of being a white dwarf .",
    "the determination of the spectral type of 24 white dwarfs more than doubles the number of existing identifications of white dwarfs in globular clusters . as in the earlier studies ,",
    "we find a complete lack of dbs in our sample .",
    "a critical , and in this case particularly challenging , component of any spectroscopic study , is the target selection .",
    "we used two sources of pre - imaging to select stars that lie on the white - dwarf cooling curve of messier 4 .",
    "white dwarf candidates were selected from the _ wfpc2 _",
    "photometry published in @xcite , and from _ gemini / gmos _ imaging .",
    "these targets were followed up with the two multi - slit spectrographs : _ gemini / gmos _ and _ keck / lris_.    our most secure white dwarf targets come from the _ wfpc2 _  photometry .",
    "stars in these fields have their cluster membership confirmed by their proper motions . however , there are two limitations with the _ wfpc2 _  imaging .",
    "first , both the _ gmos _  and the _ lris _  fields - of - view are much larger than the _ wfpc2 _  field . in order to maximize the number of spectra , we must distribute the targets evenly over the spectroscopic fields , and therefore some of our spectroscopic targets fell outside the _ wfpc2 _",
    "field of view .",
    "second , the psfs of ground - based instruments are obviously much broader than that of the _ wfpc2_. some of the white dwarfs that are easily resolved with _ wfpc2 _   are lost in the scattered light from bright stars in ground - based photometry in this crowded field .      in order to obtain stars over the entire _ gmos _  field , _",
    "gmos _  pre - imaging was obtained .",
    "the stars selected from the _ gmos _  photometry could only be selected in colour - magnitude space , and not proper - motion space , and therefore their cluster membership is less certain . _",
    "lris _ , _ gmos _ , and _",
    "all have different fields of view , and some areas of the sky have been studied with all three instruments , while others have only been studied by one or two .",
    "the footprints for the various instruments are shown in figure [ foot.fig ] .",

    "the objects targeted for _ lris _  spectroscopy are shown with pluses .",
    "[ foot.fig ] ]    in order to effectively select white dwarf candidates over the entire _ gmos_field , pre - imaging was taken in both the g@xmath25 and r@xmath25 filters .",
    "the images were corrected for bias and flat fielding by the _",
    "gemini _ pipeline .",
    "the pre - processed images were then reduced with the standard daophot / allstar reduction techniques @xcite .",
    "this photometry was not used for anything other than the target selection , and hence was not rigorously calibrated .",
    "there are @xmath26 stars imaged both with _ wfpc2 _  and _ gmos_. in order to calibrate the _ gmos _  photometry , a transformation between the _ gmos_and the calibrated _",
    "photometry was determined .",
    "the transformation was of the form : @xmath27 the coefficients were determined from minimizing @xmath28 using the downhill - simplex method _ amoeba _ @xcite , and were found to be : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",

    "clearly all have the same metallicity and age , however , delaying discussion of these points to section [ pe.sec ] , the cluster environment is unlikely to impart any other common property . correlations of angular momentum , magnetic field , and rotation are all likely to be washed out during the formation of the cluster @xcite .",
    "we can therefore treat the stars as individual data points .",
    "we can use binomial statistics to determine the probability of observing no db white dwarfs .",
    "the binomial distribution has the following form : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of observed events , @xmath49 is the number of trials , and @xmath50 is the probability of any one event giving a `` positive result '' ( i.e. , having a non - da spectral type ) . when no events are observed , equation [ poisson.eq ] takes a particularly simple form : @xmath51    under the assumption that the da / db ratio , @xmath52 , is the same in the cluster environment as it is in the field , the probability of any one white dwarf being of type db is : @xmath53    from sdss - dr4 , @xcite found @xmath54 for temperatures between @xmath0@xmath1 k , implying @xmath55 .",
    "putting the preceding equations together , we have an expression for the probability , @xmath56 , of observing no db white dwarfs : @xmath57    assuming all 24 white dwarfs are cluster members , the probability of observing no db white dwarfs is @xmath2 ( @xmath58 in a normal distribution ) . however , there is almost certainly a small level of contamination by field white dwarfs .",
    "nine of the stars have their proper motions measured from _ wfpc2_astrometry .",
    "these stars are almost certainly cluster member .",
    "the probability of observing no dbs in this sub - sample is @xmath59 ( @xmath60 in a normal distribution ) .",
    "an additional ten stars have photometry _ very _ close to the @xmath61-cooling curve . if we include these , for a total of 19 cluster members , the probability of observing no dbs is @xmath62 ( @xmath63 in a normal distribution ) . of the remaining five stars , two ( l8 and l22 ) have photometry marginally consistent with the white dwarf cooling sequence , while the other three ( l2 , l7 , and l21 ) are unlikely to be cluster members",
    ". we will only include nineteen stars with cluster membership established by either proper motion or photometry in the following analysis .",
    "we should also take into account the white dwarfs identified by @xcite .",
    "if we add the 9 white dwarfs identified by them in two other globular clusters , the total number of globular cluster identifications rises to 28 .",
    "the chance of observing no dbs in a sample this large is only @xmath64 ( @xmath65 in a normal distribution ) . as a final note , @xcite recently reported the discovery of 24 he - core white dwarfs in ngc 6397 .",
    "these all show h@xmath45 absorption , and are therefore likely _ all _ das .",
    "however , because these are photometric identifications , we will not consider these any further .",
    "it is now clear that the da / db ratio in globular clusters is different from that in the field .",
    "since 2005 , a substantial number of white dwarfs in open clusters have had their spectral types determined .",
    "there are now a handful of non - da white dwarfs identified .",
    "dbs have been found in ngc 6633 and ngc 6819 by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "a dba has been identified in the hyades , and a dq has been identified in ngc 2168 @xcite . it should be noted that none of the stars have their memberships confirmed by proper motions .",
    "however , assuming that all these stars are indeed genuine cluster members , we can calculate the probability of observing four or fewer non - das , @xmath66 , in the total sample of @xmath67 stars : @xmath68 the equivalent of a @xmath69 deviation in a normal distribution .",
    "it is now incontrovertible that the da / db ratio in the cluster environment is different from that in the field .      from the examination of cooling curves , and from the fitting of spectral lines ( see kalirai et al .",
    "2009 ) , we can constrain the effective temperatures of our stars to be cooler than @xmath1 k. this is cool enough for he - convection to begin in white dwarfs with thin hydrogen envelopes , and would therefore transform at least a fraction of them to dbs .",
    "we can therefore use a hydrogen - rich atmosphere as a proxy for a thick hydrogen layer .",
    "the dearth of db white dwarfs is more accurately thought of as a dearth of thin hydrogen envelopes . for the remainder of this section we will refer to white dwarfs with thick hydrogen envelopes as hydrogen rich ( hr ) , those with thin hydrogen envelopes as hydrogen poor ( hp ) .    at first blush",
    ", one may imagine many explanations that could explain the dearth of hp white dwarfs .",
    "however , many of these can be eliminated with several simple observations .",
    "the dearth of hp white dwarfs has now been observed in many open clusters and several globular clusters .",
    "these clusters cover a wide range of metallicity ( from @xmath70[fe / h]@xmath71 ) , and we will therefore ignore any explanation that invokes metallicity .",
    "furthermore , these clusters cover an extremely wide range of ages ( from 100 myr12 gyr ) , and therefore white - dwarf masses .",
    "the dearth of hp white dwarfs has been seen clearly in populations with average masses ranging from @xmath72 @xmath7  in open clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath73 @xmath7  in globular clusters .",
    "these extreme populations comfortably bracket the peak of the mass distribution observed in the disk ( @xmath74 @xmath7 , see * ? ? ?",
    "we will therefore also ignore any explanation that invokes white dwarf mass . in the most general terms , we can propose explanations that either prevent the formation of hp white dwarfs , or transform the hp white dwarfs back to hr ones .      in order to prevent the formation of a hp white dwarf , we require a mechanism that will reduce the efficiency with which a star expels or burns its hydrogen envelope .",
    "one can imagine mechanisms involving binary stars that could affect the retention of a hydrogen envelope .",
    "there is evidence that the binary fraction in globular clusters is significantly lower than that of the field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the binary fraction for extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars is much lower in globular clusters than it is in the field @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that if sufficient mass is lost , a star can depart the red giant branch ( rgb ) before experiencing a helium core flash .",
    "these stars will experience the core flash later in their evolution and are referred to as `` hot flashers '' , and will be manifested as ehb stars in a globular cluster , or as sub - luminous o stars in the field .",
    "@xcite showed that if the flash happens late enough during the star s evolution , the energy of the flash can drive the expansion of the convection zone so that it engulfs the entire hydrogen envelope .",
    "this hydrogen will then be completely burned , and the resulting atmosphere will be completely dominated by helium .",
    "if binaries drive mass loss , and increase the incidence of `` hot flashers '' , then higher binary fraction in the field may account for the increased incidence of hp white dwarfs there .",
    "however , only a small fraction of white dwarfs are formed from ehb stars , and not all of the ehb stars will be late hot flashers .",
    "this casts doubt upon the binary fraction / ehb channel as begin a likely explanation .",
    "furthermore , the dearth of hp white dwarfs is also seen in open clusters , which have not been shown to have binary fractions significantly different from the field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "this casts doubt on the binary fraction in general being a feasible explanation .",
    "another possible avenue to lose mass might be very close encounters with other cluster members .",
    "the rate , @xmath52 , of interactions within a given radius can be estimated as , @xmath75 where @xmath49 is the number density of stars , @xmath76 is the cross - section of interaction , and @xmath77 is the typical velocity of the interacting particles . for the mechanism to be successful , it requires a rate of at least one per typical rgb - star lifetime , which is assumed to be @xmath78 myr .",
    "an interaction that liberates a significant mass of gas from a rgb star will have a radius comparable to several times the radius of the star , which is approximately @xmath79 au .",
    "finally , we assume a velocity that is in line with a typical velocity dispersion of a star cluster , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "rearranging equation [ nsv.eq ] , we can estimate the necessary density for one interaction to occur within the lifetime of a rgb star @xmath81 this density is higher than is present in most , if not all , globular clusters , and _ far _ higher than the majority of open clusters , and is hence unlikely to be a feasible explanation .",
    "transforming an hp white dwarf  to a hr white dwarf  simply requires the star to re - accrete a hydrogen envelope .",
    "a re - accreted hydrogen layer can either suppress convection in the helium layer or , if it is thick enough , resist being drawn into the interior of the star completely when convection does occur .",
    "it is unclear what the absolute minimum mass of hydrogen necessary for this , however , we can get a lower limit by examining the accretion rate of white dwarfs in the field .",
    "the bondi accretion rate is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the mass of the star , @xmath84 is the relative velocity of the gas and the star , @xmath49 is the number density of protons , and @xmath85 is the mass of the proton . substituting typical values for a disk white dwarf , we have @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "the stars we are examining have cooling time of approximately @xmath90 myr , and hence we would expect the average field white dwarf at a temperature similar to the white dwarfs observed in m4 to have accreted approximately @xmath91 of hydrogen from the ism . we assume a lower limit to transform a db to a da is an order of magnitude greater than this , i.e. , @xmath92 , or equivalently @xmath93 , or finally , @xmath94.while we do not yet have a definitive scenario that can increase the accretion rate to the requisite level , we will briefly examine two possibilities : accretion from a central reservoir of gas , and accretion from the cluster wind ( i.e. , the composite wind from all stars ) .    an obvious way to increase the density of the intra - cluster medium , and therefore the accretion rate of the cluster white dwarfs , is accretion of gas into the cluster potential .",
    "@xcite explore the accretion of gas into the gravitational potentials of star clusters , and the subsequent effect on accretion rates of individual stars .",
    "the efficiency at which a cluster can accrete gas is determined primarily by the relative velocities of the cluster compared with the ism .",
    "most globular clusters move at velocities relative to the ism of @xmath95 with respect to the ism , and will not effectively accrete gas .",
    "as the relative velocity of the cluster and ism drops below the velocity dispersion of the cluster , the cluster potential starts to accrete gas , and dramatically increases the accretion rate of the individual stars .",
    "the estimated rate for a globular cluster with a velocity dispersion of @xmath96 , according to @xcite , is @xmath97 .",
    "this rate is well above the required rate .",
    "however , the fact that most globular clusters ( including m4 , ngc6397 , and ngc6752 , i.e.  all the globular clusters that have had spectral observations reported ) have velocities well above this velocity , makes this an unlikely explanation for the observed effect . furthermore",
    ", the shallow potential of open cluster makes this an unlikely scenario in that environment too .",
    "another source of gas could be the collective winds of the other stars in the cluster .",
    "the winds from evolved low- and intermediate - mass stars have typical velocities of @xmath98@xmath99 and hence we would not expect the gas to be retained by the gravitational potential of most clusters",
    ". the accretion would therefore be from a smooth cluster wind .",
    "this scenario was explored for the open cluster ngc 2099 in @xcite , and found to be an unlikely explanation .",
    "following their analysis , we present a more general expression for the accretion rate due to a cluster wind .    in order to estimate the density of the cluster wind",
    ", we make several assumptions .",
    "first , we assume the cluster has a salpeter mass function from @xmath100@xmath101 , the upper limit being the approximate limit at which white dwarfs will form .",
    "we determine an expression for the turn - off mass , @xmath102 , as a function of time by examining the models of @xcite .",
    "we find a satisfactory fit with @xmath103 in order to determine the mass loss per star , we subtract the remnant mass as determined in kalirai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) from @xmath102 .",
    "the mass returned to the ism , @xmath104 , is @xmath105    the lifetime of a main sequence star combined with the imf tells us the number of stars evolving off the main sequence as a function of time .",
    "each star leaving the main sequence returns a certain mass of gas back to the ism , and therefore the total mass begin returned to the ism as a function of time can be calculated .",
    "assuming the cluster retains none of this gas , this is equivalent to the mass loss from the cluster .",
    "unfortunately , due to the form of equations [ mto.eq ] and [ mism.eq ] this could not be done analytically .",
    "the numerical result was well approximated by the following expression for mass loss from a cluster due to the composite stellar wind in units of @xmath106 , @xmath107 of course , not all the stars returning gas to the ism are at the center of the cluster , but due to mass segregation the most massive star will be the most centrally concentrated .",
    "the approximation that all the mass loss occurs at the center of the cluster is good enough for our purposes .",
    "the gas density due to the cluster wind at a radius @xmath108 from the cluster center will be @xmath109 this density is far below the critical density necessary for accretion to transform hp to hr white dwarfs , and is in fact less than the mean density of the ism , and hence can be neglected .",
    "this treatment of mass loss and accretion has been rather crude .",
    "we assumed that the gas leaves the cluster in a smooth way .",
    "perhaps the winds from different stars interact in a way that causes them to cool , and be retained by the cluster more efficiently than one would navely expect .",
    "with an additional 24 white - dwarf spectral - type identifications , we have roughly tripled the number of spectral identifications in globular clusters .",
    "all the newly identified white dwarfs are das .",
    "this extends the already - observed phenomenon of star clusters being deficient in non - da white dwarfs to cover essentially all metallicities and white - dwarf masses .",
    "it is now incontrovertible that the da / db ratio is different in the field than in the cluster environment .",
    "the discovery of a handful of non - da white dwarfs in several open clusters show that is not _",
    "impossible _ to form a non - da white dwarf in the cluster environment , however , the formation mechanism is clearly strongly suppressed .",
    "unfortunately , there is no obvious mechanism for this , but it seems likely that some mechanism exists that enables the re - accretion of a hydrogen envelope .",
    "the dearth of non - da white dwarfs in clusters relative to the field has now been clearly demonstrated across the full range of age and metallicity , and remains an unsolved problem in stellar evolution .",
