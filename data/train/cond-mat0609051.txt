    "<S> the ground state of spin-1 haldane chains is characterized by the so - called string order . </S>",

    "<S> the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain is a prominent example of a spin - liquid , an exotic state of matter where interactions play a dual role : on the one hand a strong hund s rule coupling locally leads to the formation of magnetic spin-1 degrees of freedom , on the other hand spin correlations screen magnetism completely . as conjectured by haldane in the early eighties </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , spin-1 chains are characterized by a finite gap in their spectrum and by exponentially decaying spin - spin correlations . since this seminal work a lot of progress have been made , theoretically and experimentally , towards a full description of the so - called  haldane phase  . in particular , affleck , </S>",

    "<S> the aklt ground state is made up solely of nearest - neighbor singlets ( or valence bonds ) and the gap in the system ( and therefore in the spin-1 chain ) corresponds to the energy needed to break a bond .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we want to address the question to what extent the haldane chain is different from an ordinary band insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has also a gap and an even number of electrons per unit cell and , recently , one of the authors has shown @xcite that luttinger surfaces can not be used to distinguish band- from correlated insulators . </S>",
    "<S> two properties , though , are considered peculiar of the haldane phase : first , when a spin-1 chain is cut , a localized fractionalized excitation , namely a spin-1/2 , is formed at the boundary of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> these boundary spins have for example been observed in the nmr profile close to the chain ends of mg - doped @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the ground state possesses a hidden long - range order characterizing the entanglement of the spins : den nijs and rommelse @xcite noticed that , even though true nel order is absent in the ground state , any site with @xmath1 is followed by another with @xmath2 , separated from the first by a string of @xmath3 of arbitrary length . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the so - called string order ( so ) parameter @xmath4 is always finite in the haldane phase .    </S>",
    "<S> a spin-1 chain can be deviced on a spin-1/2 ladder using a strong ferromagnetic rung coupling @xmath5 which binds two spin 1/2 into a single spin 1 . in this case </S>",

    "<S> finally , we consider the fate of the string order in dimensions larger than one .    the starting point of our discussion is the following family of ladder hamiltonians ( see top of fig .  [ string ] ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates the two legs of the ladder ( or two orbitals of an atom ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ string ] the string order is maximal @xcite , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , respectively . remarkably , the string order is also finite for the two local band insulators of the second row : @xmath47 , @xmath44 and @xmath48 , @xmath46 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the string , however , still contributes with a factor @xmath51 . how can these different  order parameters  be connected ? to answer this question we calculate the two string orders along the adiabatic path connecting the two local insulators ( i.e. on segment b of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the two string orders can coexist . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we find that in one - dimensional band insulators string order is always present  even in the absence of interactions ! </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the pure spin models generically both string order parameters are finite ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ stringorder ] ) and they are smooth functions of @xmath64 for @xmath65 . in our model , for @xmath40 the two string orders are equal by symmetry , @xmath66 ( this follows from the more general relation @xmath67 that can be understood in terms of the following transformation on the ladder : shift of the lower leg by one lattice site and mirror - reflection of the ladder respect the x - axis ) . only for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , when the gap vanishes , both @xmath68 and @xmath69 deplete to 0 because at the critical point singlets of arbitrary length are generated . </S>",
    "<S> the two orders , @xmath69 and @xmath68 , coexist in gapped insulators also in the presence of strong interactions as long as ( virtual ) charge fluctuations are allowed . this can be seen from the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ stringorder ] : a doubly occupied or empty site allows to switch from diagonal to rung singlets .    </S>",
    "<S> we now outline the consequences of our discussion for the phase diagram of generalized hubbard ladders , sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ adipath ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , gapped systems are stable against small perturbations and therefore there is a finite range of parameters which allows to connect adiabatically haldane states and antiferromagnetic ladders . </S>",
    "<S> second , in a pure spin model it is _ not _ possible to connect these two phases as their wave functions live in different topological sectors of the spin hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect that beyond some critical value of @xmath18 a phase transition line ( first or second order ) or an intervening phase should separate the even and odd sectors@xcite .    for pure spin models , starykh and balents@xcite analyzed the possible intervening phases and concluded that without extra fine - tuning there is never a direct second order transition from the haldane to the antiferromagnetic ladder . either the transition is first order or intervening phases with broken translational invariance appear . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a direct second - order transition is consistent with our finding that the two high - symmetry phases are adiabatically connected .    </S>",
    "<S> to gain further insight in nature of the phase diagram sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ adipath ] at finite @xmath18 , we observe that for @xmath40 and @xmath70 , our ladder gains an extra mirror symmetry ( this is evident unfolding the ladder on a chain , as shown in the lower part of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gaps ] ) and we expect that its properties are similar to the ones of the well - studied@xcite one - dimensional _ ionic _ hubbard model ( i.e. a hubbard model with a staggered potential ) which has the same symmetries . for this system upon increasing @xmath18 ( see upper part of fig .  [ gaps ] ) </S>",
    "<S> first the charge gap of the band insulator closes and one obtains a dimerized phase for @xmath71 . for @xmath72 the system becomes a uniform , gappless mott insulator ( effectively a uniform heisenberg _ chain_@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect that @xmath73 in the schematic phase diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ adipath ] has a similar role as @xmath74 , i.e. the charge gap vanishes and a dimerized phase ( not shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ adipath ] ) appears for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , where @xmath68 is bigger or smaller then @xmath69 , dependingly on which of the two degenerate ground states one considers . according to the results of starykh and balents@xcite discussed above , we do , however </S>",
    "<S> , not expect a gapless phase for generic parameters ( e.g. @xmath77 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the role of string order in the charge sector of the ionic hubbard model is briefly discussed in appendix  [ chargeorder ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the charge and spin gaps and @xmath80 is the dimerization order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bottom : the ladder of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamiltonian ] ) unfolded on a chain . </S>",
    "<S> an extra mirror symmetry is present for @xmath40 and @xmath70 . ]    at this point we would like to investigate the emergence of the edge - states following again the path depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ string ] . </S>",
    "<S> the localized spin 1/2 at the boundary of the haldane phase evolves smoothly in a surface bound state of the  diagonal  band insulator . </S>",
    "<S> for finite interactions and a proper choice of the chemical potential , this surface bound state will be singly occupied giving rise to a localized spin . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bondstate ] we show how this edge state merges with one of the bands when @xmath37 is increased for @xmath81 . at this point , the localization length of this state diverges with @xmath82 ( inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bondstate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this is not related to any bulk phase transition .    up to now </S>",
    "<S> we have only discussed one - dimensional ladders and it is interesting to study the role of string order in higher dimensions . especially in gapped systems one would naively expect that any type of long - range order is stable against small perturbations like a coupling to neighboring ladders . using the methods described above , we can easily calculate the string order for two- and three - dimensional band insulators numerically . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly we find that for arbitrarily weak inter - ladders coupling , @xmath83 , the string order decays exponentially , @xmath84 with @xmath85 ( see fig .  [ 2dstring ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar observation has been made previously by todo _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who studied spin-1 ladders numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the string order is a consequence of ( rare ) inter - ladders singlets which introduce a random phase @xmath86 in the string . </S>",
    "<S> we note that obvious generalizations @xcite of the string order parameter to higher dimensions ( replacing strings by squares or cubes ) are ineffective again due to  dangling singlets  at the infinite surface of such structures .    ) for a two - dimensional lattice decays as @xmath87 ( with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 from up to down ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : @xmath11 as a function of @xmath90 . ]    in conclusions , we have shown that three phases with both spin- and charge gaps and two electrons per unit cell , namely haldane chains , band - insulators and antiferromagnetic ladders , are actually all the same in the sense that their unique ground states can be adiabatically connected ( the excitation spectra , however , may change ) . </S>",
    "<S> this cousinship is reflected in the prevalence of string order in all these one - dimensional phases , even in non - interacting band insulators . however , string order is not robust in higher dimensions , where it is destroyed by arbitrarily weak coupling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting open question is the precise role of the schrieffer - wolff transformation , a central tool to derive effective models . </S>",
    "<S> such a unitary transformation eliminates charge degrees of freedom completely and therefore maps the non - magnetic ground state of hamiltonians with charge gap into one of the topological sectors of the spin models . as we have connected two _ </S>",
    "<S> different _ sectors adiabatically along our path , this seems to imply that the schrieffer - wolff transformation has to break down at some point . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a scenario where at @xmath73 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ adipath ] the charge gap closes . </S>",
    "<S> however , one also has to take into account that a schrieffer - wolff transformation is not uniquely defined as it depends e.g. on the choice of a single - particle basis and therefore the topological sector may not be uniquely defined in the presence of charge fluctuations .    </S>",
