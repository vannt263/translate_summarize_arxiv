    "over the era of relativistic nuclear collisions , the statistical - thermal models have been widely used in the analysis of particle production . during the past few years",
    ", these models have been successful in describing particle multiplicities in high energy nuclear reactions at the stage where inelastic collisions between hadrons cease ( chemical freeze - out ) , see e.g. @xcite .    the easiest to handle , thence",
    "the most used , statistical model calculational framework is based on the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble . in the gc approach entropy",
    "is maximized using the constraints of conserved _ ensemble averages _ of energy and charges .",
    "this allows the net charges to fluctuate from sample to sample even though the actual charges brought into the physical reactions were exactly same every time . in the large volume and energy limit",
    ", the error in such an assumption due to charge fluctuations is negligible .",
    "on the other hand , when the involved volumes are small , like in e@xmath0e@xmath1 , p@xmath2 , pa reactions or in peripheral aa reactions , the charge fluctuations allowed in gc formalism give a large theoretical error .",
    "so , the gc ensemble turns out to be inadequate for the analysis of experimental results and the statistical ensemble to be used is rather the canonical one , enforcing exact conservation of relevant charges . in this case",
    "entropy is maximized using the constraint of conserved ensemble average of energy , but charges are not allowed to fluctuate .",
    "statistical models based on the canonical ensemble have been able to reproduce particle multiplicities even in elementary collisions , although in those there is clearly no room for kinetic thermalization @xcite .",
    "also , the strangeness enhancement with increasing system size in p  a reactions can be explained by a canonical effect @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate whether and to what extent the canonical treatment is relevant for actual heavy ion collisions .",
    "the main difficulty of canonical calculations is related to the involved large values of baryon number and electric charge , which make the numerical computation of canonical partition functions quite hard .",
    "we present here an efficient numerical method to carry out such calculations which enabled us to implement exact charge conservation up to baryon number @xmath3 whereas with old methods it was only possible to reach @xmath4 @xcite with very long computation times .    after deriving the needed expressions of mean particle numbers , we present a systematical study of the chemical factors appearing in the canonical statistical model .",
    "along with some comparison between grand - canonical and canonical calculations , we show a comparison with experimental results for peripheral to central a  a reactions at ags and sps energies .    in section [ gamma ]",
    ", we briefly address the role of the so - called relative strangeness chemical equilibrium , usually parametrized with @xmath5 , in canonical statistical - thermal models .",
    "in nuclear physics , the problem of calculating the relativistic canonical partition function has been handled by several different methods , see e.g. @xcite . here , we employ a very general group theoretical method ",
    "applicable to any internal symmetry represented by a semi - simple lie algebra ",
    "first introduced by cerulus @xcite .    by denoting the set of conserved quantum numbers by @xmath6",
    ", the canonical partition function @xmath7 can be obtained from the usual grand - canonical partition function @xmath8 by using a projecting operator onto the conserved quantum numbers . in the case of @xmath9 internal symmetries of type @xmath10 , the projection takes the form : @xmath11           z_{gc}(t , v,\\{\\lambda_{c_i}\\ } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : projection}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a @xmath10 group parameter and a wick - rotated fugacity factor @xmath13 is introduced , for every charge @xmath14 .    in order to calculate @xmath8 in the above",
    "integral , we will assume the boltzmann statistics for all hadron species .",
    "the error involved in such an approximation for final particle multiplicities , when resonance decays is taken into account , is some percent in case of pions and much less for all other hadrons .",
    "quantum statistics may be used , but requires somewhat heavier calculations and disregarding it does not essentially affect any forthcoming argument .    in heavy ion reactions , the relevant set of conserved charges is @xmath15 , namely baryon number , strangeness and electric charge . denoting the partition function of hadrons carrying none of the previous charges by @xmath16 , and writing @xmath8 by using the one - particle partition function @xmath17 \\int { { \\rm d}}^3 p \\exp [ -\\sqrt{p^2+m_i^2}/t]$ ] for each hadron @xmath18 , we find    @xmath19\\right\\}. \\label{pro1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the direct numerical computation of the triple integral above is a formidable task for @xmath20 .",
    "the integral can be turned into a sum over many indices of modified bessel functions @xmath21 , yet its evaluation is very time consuming and becomes impractical with baryon number larger than @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have chosen another approach , which has been applied in elementary collisions @xcite . from ( [ pro1 ] )",
    "one finds the integrand to be violently oscillating for large net quantum numbers , so it is worth trying to eliminate analytically the source of strongest oscillation ; in heavy ion reactions , the baryon number is always the largest of the set @xmath23 , so it is certainly the most beneficial to eliminate the integration over @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , this can be done by taking advantage of a special feature of baryon number , that is no elementary hadron exists with @xmath25 .",
    "we first rewrite equation ( [ pro1 ] ) in the form    @xmath26 \\exp\\left[\\sum_{m,\\overline{m}}z_i^1 e^{{{\\rm i}}(s_i\\phi_s+q_i\\phi_q)}\\right],\\label{canpart}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the two summations run over baryons and mesons , respectively . as @xmath27 for all of the baryons , we can write the baryon summation as : @xmath28 where baryonic and antibaryonic terms have been separated . introducing the notation @xmath29 , the above equation can be rewritten as : @xmath30 substituting this expression in eq .",
    "( [ canpart ] ) and changing the baryon variable according to @xmath31 allows us to perform analytically the integration in @xmath32 , which yields a modified bessel function i@xmath33 : @xmath34 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we are left with a double integration only which can be then performed numerically with no major problem provided that , @xmath24 being very large , the uniform asymptotic expansion of bessel functions for large orders is used to compute i@xmath33 .",
    "it is worth noting , that the form ( [ partt ] ) does not involve a saddle - point approximation used in @xcite .",
    "actually , for very small systems it is not even applicable , because the integrand ( [ pro1 ] ) is rather smoothly distributed in the group parameter space @xmath35 , so the basic assumption of the saddle - point method fails .",
    "the mean particle numbers of primary hadrons ( i.e. those directly emitted from the hadronising source ) @xmath36 are obtained from the equation  ( [ partt ] ) @xcite by taking the derivative of the canonical partition function with respect to a fictitious fugacity @xmath37 : @xmath38 where the quantity @xmath39 is called _ chemical factor _ @xcite . in the large volume ( thermodynamical ) limit , this expression becomes the gc one , i.e. @xmath40 .    the canonical baryon chemical factor can be defined as that relevant to baryons with vanishing strangeness and electric charge , e.g. neutrons : @xmath41 so that in the gc limit one gets : @xmath42 similarly , one can define chemical factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 for strangeness and electric charge respectively .",
    "it must be emphasized that , unlike in the gc framework where the total fugacity is actually a product of different charge fugacities powered to the number of charges carried by the hadron , the canonical chemical factors can not be factorized and must be calculated , as indicated in equation ( [ cmean ] ) , as a ratio of partition functions for different sets of quantum numbers .",
    "the relative differences between chemical factors and their gc counterparts and quantities related to these differences are defined , in this paper , as _",
    "canonical effects_.    in addition to the comparison between full canonical calculations and gc ones , it is very important to assess whether the enforcement of exact strangeness conservation with gc treatment of baryon number and electric charge ( _ strangeness canonical ensemble _ ) is indeed sufficient to produce results close enough to full canonical ones . here",
    ", we only quote the analytical form of strangeness - canonical partition function @xmath45 derived using the method introduced in @xcite : @xmath46 in the equation above , we denote the sum of one particle partition functions carrying the same quantum numbers as @xmath47 by @xmath48 , and similarly for other kinds of multistrange hadrons , while @xmath49 stands for the sum @xmath50 . in this case ,",
    "mean particle numbers read : @xmath51",
    "first of all , we point out that we do not perform fits to experimental results in this paper .",
    "indeed , as our main motivation is to test the statistical canonical formalism in the heavy ion collision regime , we only take some suggestive values for freeze - out temperatures and baryon densities from our recent work on the analysis of particle multiplicities in heavy ion systems in the laboratory momentum range from gsi sis 1.7 @xmath52 gev to cern sps 158 @xmath52 gev @xcite and make comparisons between canonical and grand - canonical calculations for those values .",
    "the peculiar feature of canonical formalism is a nonlinear volume behaviour of mean particle numbers because of the dependence of chemical factors on the volume according to eqs .",
    "( [ cmean],[pro1 ] ) . to show this effect",
    ", we first fix the baryon density @xmath53 so that the dependence of the chemical factors on the volume turns into a dependence on net baryon number .",
    "as the temperature is fixed too , then the grand - canonical baryon chemical potential can be calculated and the difference with the corresponding chemical factor can be studied .",
    "furthermore , net strangeness @xmath54 and electric charge @xmath55 are fixed by the initial conditions of the collision ( namely zero and @xmath56 respectively ) .",
    "the canonical effect is the most significant at comparatively low energies , such as 1.7 gev per nucleon in sis au  au collisions . in our recent analysis @xcite",
    "we find the best fit to experimental results with thermal parameters @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 mev .",
    "these values yield , in the pointlike hadron gas framework , a baryon density lower than 0.1 @xmath59 , which is used as a reference value in order to study the canonical effect in heavy ion collisions as a function of the number of participants - i.e. net baryon number - in the collision . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "the chemical factor @xmath60 is shown in comparison with its gc limit @xmath61 .    under these circumstances , the canonical effect related to the baryon chemical factor",
    "is found to decrease from 2.1% at @xmath62 down to 0.7% at @xmath63 , and to further decrease rather slowly towards the gc limit with increasing baryon number or volume . for central au ",
    "au reactions , the number of participating nucleons is more than 300 , so we can conclude that the canonical baryon chemical effect is negligible .",
    "however , this is not the case for strangeness . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "the theoretical production ratio k@xmath0 over number of participating nucleons is shown to point out the canonical strangeness effect .",
    "note that we have been able to compute the full chemical factor even for @xmath64 .",
    "the ratio increases very slowly towards the gc limit , thus strangeness must always be handled canonically when analysing sis results .",
    "the relative difference between full canonical and strangeness - canonical results is 13% for @xmath62 , decreasing to 4% for @xmath63 and to 1% for @xmath65 .",
    "it must be pointed out that the above results are calculated using an isospin symmetric initial configuration whereas @xmath66 for gold nucleus . however",
    ", this variation essentially gives no change on the relative differences above , although the ratio k@xmath67 decreases naturally due to the initial neutron excess .",
    "in au  au collisions at ags energies ( 11.6 @xmath52 mev momentum ) , the chemical freeze - out temperature is found to be around @xmath68 mev and the baryon density close to the normal nuclear density @xcite . using these values",
    ", we show the canonical baryon chemical factor in comparison with the gc limit in figure  [ fig3 ] keeping a symmetric isospin initial condition .",
    "relative difference between @xmath60 and @xmath61 decreases rather quickly from 23% at @xmath62 to 1% at @xmath65 . a more realistic comparison of results in au ",
    "au with pp collisions requires different initial isospin configuration to be into account . by using temperature and",
    "baryon density quoted above , @xmath60 at @xmath69 turns out to be 81.9 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "recent experimental results on ags k@xmath72 ratios with increasing centrality @xcite serve as a basis for a further study of strangeness production behaviour at @xmath68 mev . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot the calculated k@xmath67 with results obtained in peripheral to central au ",
    "au , si  au and si  al collisions .",
    "it can be seen that all the way up from @xmath62 to @xmath73 the full canonical and strangeness - canonical results are essentially the same .",
    "all central reaction results lie on the region where the canonical effects are negligible and the gc formalism applies .",
    "strangeness enhancement in au ",
    "au system does not definitely look like being of canonical origin , whereas si ",
    "au and si  al follow roughly the curve at the normal nuclear density ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the above argument also applies for the k@xmath74 enhancement pattern shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .    whereas the kaon enhancement with increasing centrality seems not to be compatible with a purely canonical effect , inelastic pp and _ central _ p  a and a  a systems considered in ref .",
    "@xcite show a different behaviour with increasing volume .",
    "therein , it was found that k@xmath75 ratios clearly follow the canonical curves .    the best fit temperature for the multiplicities measured by na49 experiment at sps in central pb  pb reactions at 158 @xmath52 gev is found to be @xmath76 mev @xcite . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the strange baryon enhancement by using a baryon density 0.3 @xmath59 .",
    "although the baryon density in our analysis @xcite was found to be @xmath77 @xmath59 this larger value is used in order to probe the largest reasonable canonical effect .",
    "all results in figure [ fig6 ] are normalized to the _ full canonical _ baryon multiplicities per participant at the point @xmath78 .",
    "this choice reveals the slight difference between the results obtained using the @xmath54-canonical approximation and the @xmath79-canonical calculation , and forces both canonical methods to reach for the same gc limit .",
    "an interesting feature here is the fact , that the @xmath54-canonical method leads to an overestimation of the canonical effect .",
    "corresponding curves have also been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the strangeness canonical ensemble with some numerical approximations not used here .",
    "this enhancement picture has been calculated again with the assumption of an initial symmetric isospin configuration .",
    "changing the freeze - out conditions to @xmath80 mev and @xmath81 @xmath82 , the total relative enhancement of @xmath83 from canonical @xmath69 to gc @xmath84 raises to 30% for @xmath85 s , 241% for @xmath86 s and 918% for @xmath87 s .",
    "sps na49 collaboration has also measured the participant dependence of k@xmath88 ratio in pp , c  c , si  si , s  s and pb  pb reactions @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show that the roughly linear enhancement pattern is far away from the purely canonical shape .    in the same figure",
    ", one can see the weak dependence of the k@xmath88 ratio on thermal parameters .",
    "indeed , theoretical curves always lie well above the measured points , which is a strong indication that strangeness is not in complete chemical equilibrium .",
    "usually , this lack of equilibrium is taken into account by introducing a parameter @xmath5 ( see discussion in section  [ gamma ] ) , which , in the boltzmann approximation , appears as a linear coefficient in front of the k@xmath75 ratios .",
    "taking our best fit value @xmath89 @xcite brings the theoretical curves asymptotically to the experimental central pb ",
    "pb reaction points .",
    "curves with @xmath80 mev ( lowest two ) assume initial isospin symmetry , whilst the @xmath54 canonical curve with @xmath90 mev is corrected for the condition @xmath84 .",
    "it is worth quoting our result for pp to central pb ",
    "pb k@xmath91 enhancement using @xmath80 mev and @xmath81 @xmath59 taking into account the initial isospin : @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "experimentally , this ratio is about 2 as it can be inferred by looking at the points in fig .",
    "in statistical model analysis of heavy ion reactions it is found that the assumption of full chemical equilibrium of strangeness is mostly not satisfied ( @xcite and this work ) .",
    "thus , a concept of relative chemical equilibrium was inroduced @xcite and has been applied in many subsequent works .",
    "the relative chemical equilibrium means that the strange quark production is not fully equilibrated , but the distribution of strange quarks among different hadron species occurs according to statistical equilibrium ( _ statistical coalescence _ ) .    in order to parametrize the relative chemical equilibrium , another constraint in the derivation of the relevant statistical operator",
    "is needed . in the gc formalism , this constraint is the conservation of the average number of strange and antistrange quarks in addition to usual constraints for energy and charge conservation .",
    "note that this constraint is not owing to any natural symmetry of strong interactions like baryon number , electric charge and strangeness conservation .",
    "hence , as the number of produced strange quarks to be distributed among final hadrons is unknown , it always leads to the introduction of another free parameter to be determined _ a posteriori . _    using the aforementioned constraints , the grand canonical ( gc ) partition function can be written as : @xmath94,\\ ] ]    where the chemical potentials for all the relevant charges have been grouped under the symbol @xmath95 .",
    "the fugacity factor for the constrained number of strange quarks @xmath96 is usually called @xmath5 @xcite .    in the full canonical picture , where charges are not allowed to fluctuate from sample to sample",
    ", the constraint of the average number of strange and antistrange quarks can be turned into the enforcement of a fixed _ exact _ number of @xmath97 quarks .",
    "corresponding @xmath98 symmetry yields another integration variable and another phase factor , @xmath99 into the projection integral ( [ pro1 ] ) @xcite . following the procedure described in section  [ model ] the average number of hadrons @xmath100 can be written as : @xmath101 in the grand canonical limit , the corresponding number is @xmath102 as an illustrative example , take the average number of @xmath103 mesons .",
    "it does not carry any relevant charge , but the valence quark content is @xmath104 . in the gc limit @xmath105 .",
    "this leads us to the identification @xmath106    there is one major caveat in those formulae and the use of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , the canonical formalism for the _ net conserved charges _ in the system is to be applied in any reaction where they are known from the initial state ; if the system is large enough , the fluctuations allowed in gc ensemble give negligible deviation from canonical results and one is allowed to use formulae such as eq .",
    "( [ gcgs ] ) . however , the case of the number of strange quarks @xmath107 is instrinsically different .",
    "in fact , this number is not known from the initial state and may undergo large dynamical fluctuations from event to event , well beyond those ( small ) predicted by the gc formalism and its related fugacity @xmath5 . if this was the case , @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ gcgs ] ) must be understood as a sort of _ average _ fugacity rather than a proper fugacity . on the other hand , when the expected mean number of @xmath104 pairs is small",
    ", the canonical formalism should be used ( i.e. eq .  ( [ cangs ] ) ) but the probability distribution of generating a given number of @xmath104 pairs should be known in advance . as a reasonable _ ansatz _ , one can assume those pairs are independently produced so that their distribution is a poissonian @xcite .",
    "we have presented a method to calculate particle densities in the canonical framework of the statistical model , which can be effectively used in heavy ion reactions at very large values of baryon number .",
    "this method has allowed us to study the applicability of different approximations in chemical analysis , namely the grand - canonical and the strangeness - canonical ensembles .",
    "it is found that the full @xmath79 canonical formalism is only needed for elementary and very small nuclear systems up to baryon number @xmath22 . for larger systems , the baryon number and the electric charge",
    "can be safely handled in grand - canonical manner .",
    "for central au  au and pb  pb reactions , exact strangeness conservation is needed at gsi sis energies ( @xmath108 gev a ) , while at ags and sps even strangeness can be handled grand - canonically .",
    "certainly , this also applies to much higher energy rhic and lhc collisions .",
    "the observed strangeness enhancement from peripheral to central nuclear collisions @xcite is generally not reproduced by the canonical curves with fixed temperature and baryon density whilst the ags p  p to p  a to a  a _",
    "central _ reaction measurements are found to follow the canonical results @xcite .",
    "this is an indication of a possible change in reaction systematics going from peripheral to central collisions . the strange hadron enhancement in sps from p  p to pb ",
    "pb reactions is only qualitatively reproduced by canonical model .    whilst @xmath5 was not used in the derivation of our numerical results , the weak dependence of k@xmath75 ratio on the thermal parameters ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) serves as a further compelling piece of evidence in favour of incomplete strangeness chemical eqilibration in cern sps heavy ion reactions , confirming previous findings @xcite .",
