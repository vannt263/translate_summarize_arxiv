    "the future space interferometric missions have to be supplied with a reference frame of objects uniformly spaced in the sky , bright enough , and indicating no radial velocity ( rv hereafter ) oscillations at a high level of accuracy ( tens m / s ) .",
    "a large sample of relatively faint k - giants ( v = 9.5 - 13.5 mag ) that may serve as candidates to the reference sources for the _ space interferometry mission ( sim planet quest ) _ has been studied in 2001 - 2004 by @xcite in the frames of a preparatory survey ggss @xcite .",
    "as it was found by @xcite , only about 1/3 of all candidates reveal the rv - variation within 100 ms@xmath0 level , when observed with one year cadence .",
    "however , most of the objects in that sample were observed only 2 - 3 times .",
    "therefore , the real , or intrinsic variability of k - giants can not be estimated directly because of the limited number of rv - observations per star , and also because of non - zero accuracy of individual rv estimations . a more accurate study of the rv - variation of bright k - giants which was carried out by @xcite , suggests a higher fraction of rv - stable stars among k - giants . on the other hand",
    ", well representative number of observations per star ( from 11 to 28 ) reveals 34 of 179 rv - stable bright k - giants in the study by @xcite .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite suggest a correlation between the rv variability and color ( b - v ) .",
    "contrary to them , this correlation was not found by @xcite , that can be explained by worse accuracy of rv estimates in the latter case .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a study of histograms of the rv - variability published for the ggss survey by @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo simulations that take into account the limited number of observations per star and rough level of the individual rv - estimations are performed .",
    "the main idea of the simulations is that the intrinsic ( i.e. real and unknown ) distribution of the stellar rv - variability is the same for both northern ( n ) and southern ( s ) subsamples ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detail ) .",
    "since these two subsamples were observed with different instruments , and since different techniques of the rv estimation were applied , the observational uncertainties of the rv estimations in our simulations may be different for the subsamples .",
    "the subsamples differ from each other also in the number of observations per star .",
    "resulting model histograms of the rv - variability ( or sigma , as it was designated by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) depend on both intrinsic rv - variability and factors introduced by observations .",
    "the published distributions of the rv - variability may be approximated by the model histograms by adjustment of model parameters .",
    "we use the following basic assumptions to model the observational histograms presented by @xcite .",
    "\\(1 ) distribution of the intrinsic rv - variability ( or intrinsic sigma , hereafter ) is assumed to be the same for both n- and s - subsamples in our modeling .",
    "the shape of the intrinsic sigma distribution to be chosen later in this section .",
    "we note that distribution of the rv - variability is unknown for any limited number of observations .",
    "\\(2 ) obsevations introduce uncertainties into the resulted rvs .",
    "we add normally distributed uncertainties to each individual rv .",
    "\\(3 ) we consider the realistic sample sizes : @xmath1 = 148 and 341 for n- and s - subsamples , rspectively .",
    "the realistic numbers of observations per star @xmath2 = 2 and 3 for the n- and s - subsamples , respectively , are assumed in the simulations .    for a certain value of the intrinsic rv variability ,",
    "we generate @xmath2 normally distributed random radial velocities ( mean value of the radial velocity is zero , the standard deviation is the intrinsic sigma ) .",
    "then we add a normally distributed random `` observational '' uncertainty to each rv .",
    "we assume the standard deviation of this uncertainty as a free parameter in the modeling .",
    "the obtained model values of rv are used to calculate the mean radial velocity and its standard deviation ( i.e. the model sigma ) exactly in the manner done with the real observations ( see the procedure described by * ? ? ?",
    ". the described procedure is repeated @xmath1 times .",
    "it gives us @xmath1 values of the observed rv - variability .",
    "the described simulation is repeated 40 times with random values of rv . for the comparison purposes ,",
    "certain models are evaluated 100 times to make sure that results are independent of the number of simulations .",
    "the resulting values of sigma are calculated for @xmath1 simulations .",
    "the final rvs are obtained by averaging over all 40 repeated calculations .",
    "the obtained model sigmas are sorted out into the same bins in the same way as in histograms obtained from observations @xcite . as a result",
    ", we obtain the mean numbers of model sigma in each bin of n- and s- histograms .    for the comparison of the model histograms and observed rv - variability distributions , we figure out one chi - square value @xmath3 which is common for both n- and s- subsamples .",
    "the contributions of the samples into the @xmath3 are weighted proportional to the size of the samples .",
    "we consider the following three assumptions on the functional form of the intrinsic rv variability ( sigma ) in the modeling .",
    "\\(1 ) all stars have the same single value of the sigma .",
    "\\(2 ) there are two samples of stars : `` rv - stable '' and `` rv - unstable '' , and hence there are two values of the sigma .",
    "\\(3 ) the intrinsic rv - variability is a continuous value which uniformly spans a range between 0 and a certain value .",
    "the accuracy of the rv estimations introduced by the observations is a free parameter in all three cases . in the first case ,",
    "an additional free model parameter is the intrinsic sigma .",
    "more flexibility is implied in the second case , where the `` stable '' ( typically less than 50 ms@xmath0 ) and `` unstable '' ( typically greater than 100 ms@xmath0 ) sigmas , and fractions of stable and unstable stars are additional free parameters in the modeling . in the third case ,",
    "the upper limit of the continuous sigma ( the lower one is set at 0 ) is the free parameter . in the latter case ,",
    "we approximate the continuous sigma by its 100 discrete values .",
    "the modeling shows that agreement between the model and observing histograms of distribution of the rv - variability can be achieved with quite wide ranges of free parameters , whereas the fiting of the southern histogram is more difficult .",
    "our model # 1 does not agree well with the observations .",
    "the best - fit intrinsic rv - variability in the model # 1 takes high values of the order of several hundreds m / s , and the best - fit accuracy of both n- and s - observations is rough ( several hundred m / s ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath3 value is about 3.5 times higher than that obtained in the next two models .",
    "the best - fit intrinsic sigma of the `` stable '' stars in the model # 2 ranges from 10 to 30 ms@xmath0 , whereas the `` unstable '' stars have the sigma of 890 ms@xmath0 .",
    "the best - fit accuracy of the rv estimations in this case is about 100 and 50 ms@xmath0 for the southern and northern samples , respectively .",
    "the best - fit fraction of the rv - stable stars is 20% in our model # 2 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the histogram based on observations ( solid ) and the best - fit model distribution of the rv - variability ( dashed )",
    ". a higher fraction of the rv - stable stars would make the central peaks of the model histograms too high in both top and bottom panels .",
    "a lower fraction of the rv - unstable stars would create a disagreement in the tails of both n- and s - histograms .",
    "model # 3 gives the best @xmath3 value of all considered models .",
    "the best - fit observational rv - uncertainty is 50 ms@xmath0 for both n- and s - samples .",
    "the best - fit intrinsic sigma is distributed uniformly between 0 and 850 ms@xmath0 .",
    "assuming 100 ms@xmath0 as the limit between the rv - stable and unstable stars , one can obtain 12% as a fraction of the rv - stable stars in our sample .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the best - fit model and observing histograms of the rv - variability for the model # 3 .",
    "although formally the minimum @xmath3 value in the model # 3 is less that that in the model # 2 , the difference is not significant . at the same time , the comparison of figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] shows that the model # 2 better matches the shape of the observing n- and s- histograms .",
    "the real distribution of the intrinsic rv - variability can have an arbitrary shape .",
    "more precise studies of the rv - variability suggest a one - peak distribution of the intrinsic rv - variability and a higher fraction of the rv - stable stars than that found in our simulations . in order to make the fraction of the rv - stable stars higher in our modeling ,",
    "one had to assume that the maximum of the intrinsic sigma distribution would have been shifted toward the lowest values of the rv - variability .",
    "on the one hand , our model # 3 is an extreme case for such class of the intrinsic sigma distributions , and hence 12% is the lower limit for the fraction of stable stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the model # 2 is another extreme case , since the uniform distribution of the intrinsic sigma is a marginal case of arbitrary monotonously descending distributions . as a result",
    ", the real fractions of the rv - stable and unstable stars would not be that much different from 20% and 80% , respectively .         for the model # 3 .",
    "]    any deviations from our assumptions about the model parameters may change the assessed fraction of the rv - stable stars .",
    "thus , introduction of systematic errors into measurements of rvs makes the model histograms wider , allowing the fraction of bona fide rv - stable stars to be higher in this case .",
    "the observed rvs for the southern sample show worse agreement with our modeling than the northern rvs under any assumption of the balance between the fractions of rv - stable and unstable stars . in the case of the southern sample ,",
    "we might encounter with systematic errors in the observing rvs .",
    "note that the southern sample spectra were obtained with rather low s / n , of the order of 10 and even less ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "however , most of the northern stars were observed just two times .",
    "it introduces more uncertainties into the modeling for the northerm subsample .",
    "our monte - carlo simulations of observed distributions of the rv - variability reveals 12  20 % of the rv - stable stars in the 2001 - 2004 sample of the grid giant - star survey under basic assumptions on the intrinsic rv - variability distribution .",
    "our optimistic estimation is that 20 % of all considered k - giants have the intrinsic rv - variability under 30 ms@xmath0 .",
    "it is in agreement with a recent study of the rv - variability performed for bright k - giants by @xcite , but less than that found by @xcite .",
    "as it was discussed by @xcite , constraining the physical parameters of the considered candidates can help to increase the fraction of rv - stable stars , and partially explains the difference in the stable stars fractions reported in different papers .",
    "the universal receipt for a radial velocity study intended to select the rv - stable stars is to conduct as many observations per star as possible , and to achieve the accuracy of individual rv - estimations that is better than the required level of the rv - stability . in this case",
    ", the rv - variability histograms obtained from the observations will reveal the shape of the intrinsic sigma distribution .",
    "it reflects the spirit of recent searches for the rv - stable stars for prospective space interferometric missions @xcite , and agrees with the ideas and design of the ongoing sim planet quest grid candidates observations where the iodine cell technique is being applied .",
