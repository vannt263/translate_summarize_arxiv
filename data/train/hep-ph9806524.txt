    "the final round of the analysis of data taken at lep in the runs between 1990 and 1995 at energies around the @xmath0peak is going to be completed @xcite .",
    "about 16 millions of @xmath0bosons have been produced and the resulting accuracy of , e.g. , the @xmath0boson mass and its decay width is impressive ( for the latest experimental values of these quantities see @xcite ) . in view of this precision",
    "there have been huge efforts in calculating higher order corrections to these observables .",
    "this talk is supposed to be not so much a review of theoretical and experimental results but is rather concerned with some of the available tools to perform such calculations .",
    "the decay rate of the @xmath0boson into quarks constitutes an illuminating example of how to use asymptotic expansions of feynman diagrams to simplify calculations . in what follows we",
    "will only be concerned with the vertex corrections and it will always be assumed that they are computed via the optical theorem by calculating the @xmath0boson self energy and taking the imaginary part .",
    "if one considers , e.g. , only qcd - corrections , it certainly is a reasonable lowest order approximation to neglect all quark masses .",
    "only one dimensional quantity is left , the @xmath0boson mass , and one arrives at massless propagator diagrams for which the so - called _ integration - by - parts _ algorithm is available and has been explicitely worked out @xcite and implemented in a form @xcite package called mincer @xcite up to three loops .",
    "this immediately gives the answer for the @xmath0boson decay rate into massless quarks up to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "making additionally use of infrared re - arrangement , it is even possible to extend the result to @xmath2 @xcite .    as a second step one may want to take effects induced by the quark masses into acccount .",
    "then , however , one is faced with two - scale feynman integrals . although the full @xmath3result is known @xcite  the vector part even for a very long time ",
    ", at @xmath1 only certain subclasses of diagrams have been computed analytically ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    for the remaining part one",
    "is forced to consider some approximation procedure to obtain , e.g. , an expansion in @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the mass of the quark in the final state .",
    "the recipe for the efficient computation of such asymptotic expansions has been worked out in a series of publications and shall not be repeated here ( for a review see @xcite ) . the essence is to expand the integrands of certain subgraphs of the initial diagrams , leading to a complete factorization of `` small '' and `` large '' quantities .",
    "two special cases may be distinguished : when only masses appear as large quantities , the technique is called the _ hard mass procedure_. in contrast , the _ large momentum procedure _ deals with the case of only large momenta .",
    "concerning the quark mass effects in the qcd - corrections to the @xmath0boson decay rate , it is clear that here the appropriate procedure is the second one .",
    "there is only one large ( @xmath6 ) and one small ( @xmath7 ) mass scale in this problem , so the factorization mentioned above means that products of only single scale diagrams are produced : massless propagator diagrams ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and massive tadpoles ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "we already mentioned the integration - by - parts algorithm to compute the former ones .",
    "the underlying principle may also be applied to the latter ones , as has been done in @xcite , again up to three loops .",
    "the implementation of this procedure has been performed , for example , in a form package named matad @xcite .",
    "there are , of course , certain limitations of this approach both from the technical and the analytical point of view .",
    "the former one is connected with the realization of the prescriptions provided by the asymptotic expansions . to three - loop order",
    "it becomes a non - trivial task to find and properly expand the contributing subdiagrams .",
    "for one particular diagram , all subgraphs contributing to the large momentum procedure  are shown in fig .",
    "[ o2.ps ] .",
    "= 6.cm    the solution of this problem is to use the algorithmic nature of the prescriptions and to pass their evaluation to a computer . as far as the large momentum procedure  for two - point functions",
    "is concerned this has been performed in a perl program called lmp @xcite .",
    "another program , doing also the hard mass procedure , will be mentioned in section  [ sec::mixed ] .",
    "therefore , in this sense this technical limitation no longer exists .",
    "the second limitation of asymptotic expansions is more severe .",
    "it is clear that a cut series in general contains less information than the full result . in our case of the @xmath0boson decay ,",
    "let us , for example , consider the hypothetical case @xmath12 .",
    "the production of four fermions is then kinematically forbidden .",
    "a small @xmath5expansion , however , is uncapable of discriminating among any of the cases @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , which is why at first sight one can not expect to obtain reasonable results below the four - quark threshold .",
    "however , the situation is not so bad as it seems .",
    "the reason is that in general the four - particle channel has a very smooth threshold behaviour due to phase space suppression . in a small-@xmath5 expansion",
    "this smoothness is carried over to energies below the four - particle threshold preserving its validity in this region @xcite .",
    "= 6.cm    as an example the contribution to the hadronic @xmath16ratio proportional to the color factor @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the cms - energy ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ rnavx.ps ] .",
    "the first threshold is at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , the second one at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "convergence , however , seems to be warranted at least up to @xmath24 .",
    "anyway , for the @xmath0boson decay one is above any possible four - quark threshold such that convergence of the expansion to the correct answer is guaranteed .",
    "not only this : the quadratic and quartic mass corrections , which already provide a very good approximation in this case , can also be obtained without really using asymptotic expansions , even up to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "as far as the large momentum procedure   is concerned , there certainly are more important fields of application for it ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , for the hard mass procedure , important contributions to @xmath0decay have recently been computed where it really proves to be a very useful tool , as we will see in section  [ sec::mixed ] .",
    "let us turn to the electroweak radiative corrections to the @xmath0boson decay .",
    "as far as one only considers qed , the similarity to qcd allows not only to evaluate all pure qed - corrections , but also qed / qcd - corrections of order @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite from the knowledge of the diagram - wise results to @xmath1 resp .",
    "@xmath2 by altering the color factors .",
    "the situation is different when allowing also for @xmath0 and @xmath29boson exchange between the produced quarks , because of their non - negligible masses .",
    "as far as the @xmath29boson is concerned , another phenomenon occurs , namely the appearence of the isospin partners of the produced quarks as virtual particles in the loops .",
    "in contrast to the decay into @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath19 or @xmath32quarks , where this does not really produce a difference in comparison to virtual @xmath0exchange because all of them may be considered as massless , the decay into @xmath33quarks is somewhat exceptional because the @xmath33quark is the isospin partner of the @xmath34quark . neglecting",
    "the @xmath34quark mass certainly is not a good approximation , nor can it be set infinite as one knows , for example , from the radiative corrections to the @xmath35parameter that appear to be proportional to @xmath36 @xcite . nevertheless , a full result for @xmath37 to @xmath38 for the decay into @xmath39 @xcite as well as for the one into @xmath33 @xcite is available .",
    "the leading @xmath40behavior for the latter is quadratic like for the @xmath35parameter . to @xmath41",
    "the @xmath34quark enters also the calculation for the decay into @xmath42 . the leading @xmath43 and the subleading @xmath36terms to this order",
    "are known @xcite . for the decay into @xmath33quarks",
    "only the leading @xmath43terms are available @xcite .",
    "a part of the mixed @xmath26corrections , namely those induced by virtual gluon and photon exchange , has already been mentioned in section  [ sec::ew ] .",
    "the present section will be concerned with the case of @xmath29 or @xmath0 , accompanied by an additional gluon - exchange , i.e. , in a sense , qcd - corrections to the @xmath38results described in section  [ sec::ew ] .",
    "again it is natural to distinguish between the decay into @xmath42 and into @xmath33 .",
    "the former case was evaluated in @xcite , and it is instructive to dwell a bit on the technique which was used in this work .    again",
    "the rate was determined by computing the @xmath0boson self energy up to the order considered and taking the imaginary part of the result . in the case of virtual @xmath0boson exchange ,",
    "one arrives at three - loop on - shell integrals , for @xmath29exchange one gets two - scale diagrams .",
    "the idea in @xcite was to use the hard mass procedure  described in section  [ sec::asym ] to expand the diagrams in @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mass of the virtual gauge boson , and take the limit @xmath46 resp .",
    "@xmath47 in the final result .",
    "since convergence at these points turned out to be quite slow , a part of the diagrams was also expanded in @xmath48 . in this way it was possible to obtain a reasonable approximation to the full result .    in the case of @xmath49",
    "one faces the problem of an additional mass scale , the @xmath34-quark mass . using the hard mass procedure  for @xmath50",
    ", one may factor out the @xmath40dependence .",
    "however , for a part of the diagrams one still is left with two - scale and even three - scale integrals involving @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electroweak gauge parameter which we want to keep .",
    "although they appear to be only one - loop integrals , their exact evaluation up to @xmath55 produces inconvenient results . instead , the results of @xcite were obtained by applying the hard mass procedure  to these kinds of diagrams once more , this time using @xmath56 .",
    "this seemingly unrealistic choice of scales becomes justified by recalling the discussion of section  [ sec::asym ] : it is not possible for an expansion to distinguish the inequality @xmath57 from @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the latter ones being perfectly alright .",
    "the only matter is to perform the expansion on the appropriate side of all thresholds , and here one is concerned with thresholds at @xmath60 and at @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the choice @xmath62 is to be understood purely in this technical sense .",
    "graphically this continued expansion looks as follows : @xmath63{t1hmp.ps } } \\stackrel{m_t^2\\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow } \\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\epsfxsize=6em \\raisebox{-1.3em}{\\epsffile[120 260 560 450]{t3czbb.ps } }     \\star \\epsfxsize=.7em   \\raisebox{-1.3em}{\\epsffile[260 260 310 450]{t11hmp.ps } }   \\,\\,+ \\,\\,\\cdots",

    "the thick plain line is the top quark , the thick wavy one a goldstone boson with mass squared @xmath53 , for example .",
    "the thin plain lines are @xmath33quarks , the inner thin wavy lines are @xmath29bosons , the outer ones @xmath0-bosons . the spring - line is a gluon .",
    "the mass hierarchy is assumed to be @xmath64 .",
    "the freedom in choosing the magnitude of @xmath54 provides a welcome check of the routines and the results .",
    "the outcome of this procedure is a nested series : the coefficients of the @xmath65expansion are in turn series in @xmath66 .",
    "note that in contrast to the decay into @xmath42 there is no threshold at @xmath67 which makes an additional expansion in @xmath68 unnecessary .    in view of this calculation the procedure of successive application of the hard mass procedure  resp .",
    "the large momentum procedure  has been implemented in a fortran 90 program named exp @xcite .",
    "therefore , the computation of a three - loop two - point function can now be done fully automatically given some arbitrary hierarchy of mass scales .",
    "even more , the link to the feynman diagram generator qgraf @xcite in a common environment called geficom @xcite allows to obtain the result of a whole physical process without any human interference except for specification of the process and final renormalization .",
    "finally , let us present the result for the @xmath29induced corrections to the @xmath0decay rate @xmath69 in the form of the renormalization scheme independent difference to the decay rate into @xmath70 . inserting the on - shell top mass @xmath71  gev",

    "the numbers after the first equality sign correspond to successively increasing orders in @xmath77 , where the brackets collect the corresponding constant , @xmath78 and , if present , @xmath79terms .",
    "the numbers after the second equality sign represent the leading @xmath36term and the sum of the subleading ones .",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath81results are displayed separately .",
    "comparison of this expansion of the one - loop terms to the exact result of @xcite shows agreement up to @xmath82 which gives quite some confidence in the @xmath26contribution .",
    "one can see that although the @xmath36 , @xmath83 and @xmath84terms are of the same order of magnitude , the final result is surprisingly well represented by the @xmath36term , since the subleading terms largely cancel among each other .",
