    "trapping is an integral major theme of random walks ( diffusion )  @xcite , which is relevant to a wide range of applications and has led to a growing number of theoretical and practical investigation over the past decades  @xcite .",
    "the trapping problem , first introduced in  @xcite , is in fact a random - walk issue , where a trap is positioned at a given location , which absorbs all particles visiting it .",
    "the primarily interesting quantity closely related to trapping problem is the average trapping time , also referred to as the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , which is useful in the study of transport - limited reactions  @xcite , target search  @xcite and other physical problems .    an important question in the study of trapping",
    "is how the mfpt scales with the size of the system .",
    "there are some well - known results providing answers to the corresponding questions in the cases of some graphs with simple topology , including regular lattices  @xcite , sierpinski fractals  @xcite , t - fractal  @xcite , and so on",
    ". however , these graphs are not suitable to describe real systems  @xcite encountered in everyday experience , most of which are scale - free  @xcite and small - world  @xcite that have been shown to influence profoundly various dynamical processes running on networks  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural and interesting to explore the trapping problem on networks with general structure embedded in real life .",
    "although a lot of activities have been devoted to studying random walks on complex networks@xcite , work about trapping problem on scale - free small - world graphs is much less  @xcite .    in the paper",
    ", we investigate the trapping problem on the apolloian network  @xcite with scale - free and small - world properties .",
    "we focus on a specific aspect of random walks in the presence of a single trap situated at a given node with the largest degree ( hub node ) .",
    "we obtain an exact analytical solution for the mfpt and the dependence of this primary quantity on the system size .",
    "we show that the apolloian network is a preferred architecture that minimizes the increase of mfpt with network size , compared with regular networks and fractals .",
    "we first introduce the apollonian packing  @xcite , from which the apollonian network is derived .",
    "there are two commonly used apollonian packings that differ mainly in initial configurations .",
    "the first packing is constructed by starting with three mutually touching disks , the interstice of which is a curvilinear triangle . in the first generation",
    "a disk is inscribed , touching all the sides of this curvilinear triangle . for subsequent generations",
    "we indefinitely repeat the packing process for all the new curvilinear triangles . in the limit of infinite generations , an apollonian packing is obtained .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ figapollo1 ] displays the first three generations of this apollonian packing .",
    "the other frequently used apollonian packing has a initial configuration with three mutually touching disks inscribed inside a circular space .",
    "the interstices of the initial disks and circle are four curvilinear triangles to be filled .",
    "then in each subsequent generation , we add one disk to each interstice ( curvilinear triangle ) , so that the added disk touches all the three sides of the corresponding curvilinear triangle .",
    "the first several processes are shown in figure  [ figapollo02 ] .",
    "the above two apollonian packings can be easily mapped to networks , usually called as apollonian networks  @xcite .",
    "the translation from apollonian packing construction to apollonian network generation is quite straightforward .",
    "each node ( vertex , site ) corresponds to a disk , and two nodes are linked to each other if their corresponding disks are tangent . note that for the second apollonian packing , the initial circle also corresponds to a node",
    "the right panel of figure  [ figapollo1 ] shows an example of the network . since the resulting networks associated with the two packings have similar structural features , except for the initial disks , in this paper we will focus on the network based on the second apollonian packing , which is convenient for analytically deriving the network properties .",
    "according to the foregoing mapping , one can introduce a general algorithm  @xcite to create the apollonian network , denoted by @xmath0 after @xmath1 generation evolutions . for @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath3 is a tetrahedron with four faces or triangles , see figure  [ figini ] . for @xmath4 , @xmath0",
    "is obtained from @xmath5 . for each of the existing triangles of @xmath5 that is created at generation @xmath6",
    ", a new node is added and connected to all the three nodes of this triangle .",
    "figure  [ network ] illustrates the construction process for the first two generations of the initial four faces as shown in figure  [ figini ] .        according to the network construction",
    ", one can see  @xcite that at the @xmath7th ( @xmath8 ) generation , the number of newly introduced nodes is @xmath9 . from this result",
    ", we can easily compute the total number of nodes @xmath10 in network @xmath0 ( hereafter called the network order ) : @xmath11    for convenient use in the next section , we distinguish different nodes of @xmath0 by labeling them sequentially as follows .",
    "the four nodes ( i.e. , nodes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 in figure  [ figini ] ) created at initial generation are labeled as 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "then , in each new generation , we only label the new nodes added at this generation , while keep the labels of pre - existing nodes unchanged . that is to say , we label new nodes progressively as @xmath16 , in which @xmath17 is the total number of the pre - existing nodes and @xmath18 is the number of newly - added nodes .",
    "eventually , every node is labeled by a unique integer , all nodes in @xmath0 are labeled from 1 to @xmath10 , see figure  [ network ] .",
    "let @xmath19 be the degree of a node @xmath20 at generation @xmath1 , which entered the network at the generation of @xmath7 ( @xmath21 ) . then  @xcite @xmath22 from equation  ( [ ki ] )",
    ", one can easily see that at each step the degree of a node doubles , i.e. , @xmath23    the apollonian network presents the typical characteristics of real - life networks  @xcite .",
    "it has a power - law degree distribution @xmath24 with the exponent @xmath25 .",
    "its average path length , defined as the mean of shortest distance between all pairs of nodes , increases logarithmically with network order  @xcite . in the large network order limit , the average clustering coefficient tends to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the apollonian network exhibits small - world effect  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the network is disassortative  @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will investigate the mfpt for random walks with an immobile trap on the apollonian network .",
    "in this section we formulate the problem of a simple random walk of a particle on apollonian network @xmath0 in the presence of a trap or a perfect absorber positioned on a given node . to this end",
    ", we first specify @xmath0 by its adjacency matrix @xmath27 ( hereafter we neglect the subscript ) of order @xmath28 , which completely describes network @xmath0 .",
    "the element @xmath29 of @xmath30 is defined as follows : @xmath31 if the pair of node @xmath20 and node @xmath32 is connected by a link ( edge , bond ) , otherwise @xmath33 .",
    "the degree @xmath19 of node @xmath20 is @xmath34 , and the diagonal degree matrix @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 .",
    "then , the normalized laplacian matrix of @xmath0 is given by @xmath37 and its entry is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an identity matrix .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us introduce the so - called simple random walk  @xcite on network @xmath0 .",
    "at each time step ( taken to be unity ) , the walker moves from its current location to any of its nearest neighbors with equal probability .",
    "according to this rule , at time @xmath40 , a walker at a node @xmath20 will hop to one of its @xmath19 neighbors , say @xmath41 , with the transition probability @xmath42 .",
    "suppose that the walker starts from node @xmath20 at @xmath43 , then the jumping probability @xmath44 of going from @xmath20 to @xmath32 at time @xmath40 is governed by the following master equation : @xmath45    we next focus a random walk on @xmath0 with a trap .",
    "we locate the trap at node 1 , represented as @xmath46 .",
    "it should be pointed out that thanks to the symmetry , the trap can be also situated at node 2 , 3 , or 4 , which has no influence on mfpt .",
    "the particular selection for the trap location allows one to calculate analytically the mfpt , which will be addressed in detail in the next section . at each time step , the walker , starting from any node except the trap @xmath46 , jumps to any of its nearest neighbors with equal probability .",
    "let @xmath47 be mean transmit time ( first - passage time , trapping time , or the mean time to absorption ) for a walker , starting from node @xmath20 , to first arrive at the trap @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath48 .",
    "then , the set of these interesting quantities follows the recurrence equation  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt1 ] ) may be also rewritten in matrix notation as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are two ( @xmath54)-dimensional vectors , and @xmath55 is the fundamental matrix of the markov chain representing such unbiased random walk . in fact",
    ", @xmath56 is a sub - matrix of the normalized discrete laplacian matrix @xmath57 whose first row and column , corresponding to the trap node , have been removed .",
    "then , the mean first - passage time , or the average of the mean time to absorption , @xmath58 , which is the average of @xmath47 over all nodes distributed uniformly over nodes in @xmath0 other than the trap , is given by @xmath59    equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) can be easily explained by looking at the random walk from the perspective of a markov chain .",
    "actually , the entry @xmath60 of the fundamental matrix @xmath55 of the markov process expresses the average number of times that a walker starting at node @xmath20 will be at node @xmath32 , and the row sum @xmath61 is exactly @xmath47 , the total times a particle starting at node @xmath20 will traverse all other nodes before being absorbed by the trap .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) shows that the problem of determining @xmath58 is reduced to finding the sum of all elements of the fundamental matrix @xmath55 of order @xmath62 , irrespective of the seemingly compact expression of equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) , since @xmath10 increases exponentially with @xmath1 , for large @xmath1 , it becomes difficult to obtain @xmath63 through direct calculation from this equation , because of the limitations of time and computer memory .",
    "therefore , one can compute directly the mfpt only for the first generations , see table  [ tab : amta1 ] .",
    "however , the particular construction of the apollonian network allows one to calculate analytically mfpt to obtain a rigorous solution .",
    "details of derivation will be provided below .",
    ".the mfpt obtained by direct calculation from equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) since for large networks , the computation of the mfpt from equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) is prohibitively time and memory consuming , we calculate the mfpt for the first several generations . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we begin by recording the numerical values of @xmath64 .",
    "obviously , for all @xmath65 , @xmath66 ; for @xmath67 , it is a trivial case , we have @xmath68 . for @xmath69 , the values of @xmath64 can be obtained straightforwardly via equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) .",
    "table [ tab : amta2 ] lists the numerical values of @xmath64 for some nodes up to @xmath70 .",
    "the numerical values listed in table [ tab : amta2 ] show that for a given node @xmath20 we have @xmath71 .",
    "that is to say , upon growth of the apollonian network from @xmath1 to generation @xmath72 , the mean time to first reach the trap increases by a factor @xmath73 .",
    "this is a basic character of random walks on the apollonian network , which can be established from the arguments below  @xcite .",
    "consider an arbitrary node @xmath20 in the apollonian network @xmath0 after @xmath1 generation evolution . from equation  ( [ ki ] ) , we know that upon growth of the apollonian network to generation @xmath72 , the degree @xmath74 of node @xmath20 doubles .",
    "let the mean transmit time for going from node @xmath20 to any of its @xmath74 old neighbors be @xmath75 ; and let the mean transmit time for going from any of its @xmath74 new neighbors to one of the @xmath74 old neighbors be @xmath76 .",
    "then we can establish the following underlying backward equations ( see figure  [ trap ] ) @xmath77 which leads to @xmath78 .",
    "that is to say , the passage time from any node @xmath20 ( @xmath79 ) to any node @xmath32 ( @xmath80 ) increases by a factor of @xmath73 , upon the network growth from generation @xmath1 to generation @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath71 , which will be useful for deriving the formula for the mean first - passage time in the following text .     to @xmath81 .",
    "node @xmath79 has @xmath74 neighbor nodes in generation @xmath1 ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath74 new neighbor nodes in generation @xmath72 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "a new node has a degree of 3 , and is linked to @xmath20 and its two old neighbor nodes . ]",
    "having obtained the scaling of mean transmit time for old nodes , we now determine the mean first - passage time , with an aim to derive an exact solution .",
    "we represent the set of nodes in @xmath84 as @xmath85 , and denote the set of nodes created at generation @xmath1 by @xmath86 .",
    "thus we have @xmath87 . for the convenience of computation",
    ", we define the following quantities for @xmath88 : @xmath89 and @xmath90 then , we have @xmath91 next we will explicitly determine the quantity @xmath92 . to this end , we should firstly determine @xmath93 .",
    "we examine the mean time to absorption for the first several generations of apollonian network . in the case of @xmath94 , by the very construction of apollonian network , it follows that @xmath95 thus , @xmath96 similarly , for @xmath97 case , it is easy to obtain @xmath98 proceeding analogously , it is not difficult to derive that @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are actually the numbers of nodes generated at generations @xmath1 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt13 ] ) minus equation  ( [ mfpt12 ] ) times @xmath103 and making use of the relation @xmath71 , one gets @xmath104 using @xmath105 , equation  ( [ mfpt15 ] ) is solved inductively @xmath106 substituting equation  ( [ mfpt16 ] ) for @xmath107 into equation  ( [ mfpt9 ] ) and using @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 considering the initial condition @xmath110 , equation  ( [ mfpt17 ] ) is resolved by induction to yield @xmath111 plugging the last expression into equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) , we arrive at the accurate formula for the average of the mean time to absorption at the trap located at node 1 on the @xmath1th of apollonian network : @xmath112 we have checked our analytic formula against numerical values quoted in table  [ tab : amta1 ] . for the range of @xmath113 , the values obtained from equation  ( [ mfpt19 ] ) completely agree with those numerical results on the basis of the direct calculation through equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) .",
    "this agreement serves as an independent test of our theoretical formula .    from equation  ( [ nt ] ) , we have @xmath114 . hence , for large network",
    "( i.e. , @xmath115 ) , we obtain @xmath116 where the exponent @xmath117 .",
    "thus , in the large limit of network order @xmath10 , the mfpt increases algebraically with increasing order of the network .",
    "mean first - passage time @xmath63 versus network order @xmath118 on a log - log scale .",
    "the solid line is a guide to the eye . ]",
    "previous studies showed that for regular lattices  @xcite , sierpinski fractals  @xcite , and t - graph  @xcite with large order @xmath119 , their mfpt @xmath120 behaves as @xmath121 with @xmath122 . even in a complete graph of @xmath119 nodes , @xmath123",
    ", the mfpt @xmath124 grows linearly with @xmath119 as @xmath125 .",
    "actually , linear scaling of the mfpt with @xmath119 is the best that has been reported so far . from equation  ( [ mfpt21 ] )",
    ", one can see that the mfpt @xmath124 of the apollonian network increases as a fractional power of network order @xmath119 , which implies that apollonian network has a faster transmit time than any other analytically soluble media .",
    "in other words , the apollonian network has the best structure for fast diffusion one can see heretofore .",
    "in summary , we have studied trapping problem on the apollonian network exhibiting remarkable features ( scale - free behavior and small - world effects ) of a variety of real networks .",
