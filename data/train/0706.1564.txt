    "since its launch on 2004 november 20 , _ swift _ @xcite has provided detailed measurements of numerous grbs and their afterglows with unprecedented reaction times . as of 2006 january 24",
    ", 110 bursts were detected by the burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al .",
    "approximately 93% of these were observed by the narrow field instruments in less than 200 ks , and most of those were detected within 200 s ( typical reaction time was @xmath5100 s , but occasionally the bat detected a burst that was observationally constrained ) .",
    "the narrow field instruments are the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) and the ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot ; roming et al .",
    "2005 ) . by detecting burst afterglows promptly , and with high sensitivity ,",
    "the properties of the early afterglow and extended prompt emission can be studied in detail for the first time .",
    "this also facilitates studies of the transition between the prompt emission and the afterglow .",
    "the rapid response of the pointed x - ray telescope ( xrt ) instrument on _ swift _ has led to the discovery that large x - ray flares are common in grbs and occur at times well after the initial prompt emission .",
    "this paper provides the first survey of the spectral features of a large sample of these x - ray flares .",
    "while there are still many unknown factors related to the mechanisms that produce grb emission , the most commonly accepted model is that of a relativistically expanding fireball with associated internal and external shocks @xcite . in this model ,",
    "internal shocks produce the prompt grb emission .",
    "observationally , this emission typically has a timescale of @xmath6 s for long bursts and @xmath50.2 s for short bursts @xcite .",
    "the expanding fireball then shocks the ambient material to produce a broadband afterglow that decays quickly ( typically as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 for the nominal afterglow phase ) .",
    "when the doppler boosting angle of this decelerating fireball exceeds the opening angle of the jet into which it is expanding , a steepening of the lightcurve ( jet break ) is predicted @xcite . for a descriptions of the theoretical models of grb emission and associated observational properties , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for descriptions of the observational properties of the overall x - ray lightcurve , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "several authors have suggested reasons to expect continued activity from the internal engine of the grb after the classical `` prompt '' emission time frame .",
    "@xcite considered a model in which a magnetized disk around a central black hole could lead to continued energy release in the form of internal shocks .",
    "the parameters of this energy release would depend on the complex configuration of the magnetic field and the magnetic reconnection dynamics , but time periods as long as days for the delayed emission were predicted .",
    "@xcite have speculated that energy release can be repeatedly stopped and restarted at late times by magnetic flux accumulation and subsequent release . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the flares from both short and long bursts can be explained within the context of evolution and fragmentation of a viscous accretion disk . for short bursts , in particular ,",
    "@xcite have suggested that late flares can be explained by magnetic reconnection events driven by the breakout of magnetic fields from the surface of differentially rotating millisecond pulsars , which resulted from a progenitor compact binary star merger . @xcite",
    "have speculated that episodic accretion processes could explain continued internal engine activity .",
    "these authors expect that fragmentation and subsequent accretion during the collapse of a rapidly rotating stellar core could explain observations of extended prompt emission . in general",
    ", the dominant model of an expanding fireball with internal / external shocks @xcite allows for continued prompt emission , provided that the internal engine is capable of continuing the energy injection .",
    "a few observations prior to _ swift _ have included indications of flaring from grbs after the prompt grb emission phase .",
    "@xcite used xmm - newton to detect line emission from grb 030227 nearly 20 hours after the prompt burst .",
    "they inferred continued energy injection at this late time , and concluded that a nearly simultaneous supernova and grb event would require sporadic power output with a luminosity in excess of @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite used beppo - sax to observe two grbs with relatively small x - ray flares .",
    "the x - ray flare times for grb 011121 and grb 011211 were reported as t=240 s and t=600 s , respectively .",
    "the spectral parameters of these two x - ray flares were consistent with afterglow parameters , and these flares were interpreted as the onset of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "two other examples of flaring and/or late timescale emission can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although not a detection of late flares from a particular grb , the work of @xcite , in which an ensemble of grbs was analyzed , should also be mentioned . in this study , 400 long grbs detected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) were analyzed together in the form of a summed lightcurve above 20 kev .",
    "significant emission was found at late times ( at least to 1000 s ) .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this emission that do not require flares , but flares at various times are certainly one possible explanation .",
    "@xcite provided the initial report that two bursts detected by _",
    "swift _ showed strong x - ray flares .",
    "the first of these , xrf 050406 , was an x - ray flash with a short , and relatively weak , x - ray flare that peaked 213 s after @xmath11 of the prompt grb emission . due to the fast rise / decay ,",
    "the most natural explanation for this flare is continued internal engine activity at late times ( i.e. delayed prompt emission ) .",
    "xrf 050406 was analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "another burst , grb 050502b , was studied in detail by @xcite since it was the first dramatic , high - fluence x - ray flare detected .",
    "this flare , which peaked 740 s after the prompt grb emission , released as much energy in the x - ray band as the prompt grb released in the 15 - 150 kev band .",
    "following these two grbs with flares , it became clear that this was a common feature of grbs , as more and more swift bursts displayed x - ray flares .",
    "although there are a few interesting cases of optical flares and of flares simultaneous with higher energy emission detected by _",
    "swift_-bat , most of these x - ray flares were generally not accompanied by either optical or 15 - 150 kev emission at a detectable level .",
    "this implied that the peak of the emission was generally in the soft x - ray band .",
    "there have been several papers studying individual grbs with x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "while the detailed study of individual flares is important , it is equally important to look at the properties of the flares in a more general sense to look for general trends and overall mean properties of the flares . by comparing these overall properties to those of the prompt grb emission and the afterglow emission , the mechanism of the flare emission",
    "may be elucidated .",
    "furthermore , we can see if there are multiple classes of flares , or if the flare parameters all fall into one uniform distribution .    in this paper and a companion paper @xcite(referred to as paper i hereafter ) , we present the first temporal and spectral study of a statistical sample of x - ray flares within grbs .",
    "paper i presents the temporal properties of the sample , and this paper presents the spectral properties of the sample .",
    "the sample includes all bursts , up until 2006 jan 24 , for which _ swift _ detected at least one significant x - ray flare .",
    "the initial sample was chosen by looking at all _ swift_-xrt light curves , between launch and 2006 january 24 , and eliminating the ones that did not show any hint of deviation from a power law decay with typical breaks ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a discussion of typical lightcurve breaks ) .",
    "the remaining light curves were then fit with a broken power law decay ( referred to as the underlying decay curve and subscripted throughout text with `` _ ul _ '' ) superposed with a power law rise and decay for any flares that appeared above this underlying decay curve .",
    "the start time of the flare was then defined as the time that the power law rise of the flare intersected the underlying decay power law .",
    "similarly , the stop time of the flare was then defined as the time that the power law decay of the flare intersected the underlying decay power law .",
    "these times , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are defined relative to the trigger time , @xmath11 , of the grb . the signal to noise of the flare",
    "was then defined , using simple poisson statistics , as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is defined as the total number of photons during the flare time interval , and @xmath16 is defined as the number of photons from the fit to the underlying decay curve during the flare time interval . only the flares with s",
    "/ n@xmath17 were retained in the sample .",
    "this analysis of 110 grbs resulted in 33 grbs with at least one significant flare , and it resulted in a total of 77 flare time intervals , which are listed in table [ tbl : flare_sample ] .",
    "some of these 77 time intervals overlap one another so it is not always clear where one flare begins and another ends .",
    "we define the start and end of each flare as described in the analysis section below .",
    "this sample and the sample of paper i are largely overlapping , but they differ somewhat due to the different approach and goals",
    ". the flares for which temporal properties can be obtained are frequently different from those for which spectral properties can be obtained .",

    "these spectra were then fit in the same way that we fit the spectra of the flare sample , and the @xmath520 was calculated .",
    "the resulting @xmath520 distribution from this simulation was plotted as a curve overlaying the histogram of the real data in figure [ fig : delta_chi2_pow_band_gold ] .",

    "the distribution is skewed to the positive values of @xmath520 .",
    "one way to quantify this is to compare the number of grb flares with a large @xmath520 for both the real data and the simulated power law data .",

    "table [ tbl : fluence_table ] shows the fluences for both the power law and the band function fits to the flares .",
    "since the spectral fits provided no compelling evidence for using the thermal model or the exponential cutoff model , for the remainder of this paper , we restrict ourselves to the standard spectral models used for grb afterglows and prompt emission , namely the simple power law and the band function .",
    "the quoted error bars are 1@xmath2 , and they include the error due to the uncertainty in the underlying lightcurve contribution to the fluence .",
    "in some cases this latter source of error is large and dominates the error from the spectral fit itself .",
    "the calculated fluence values for all flares ( not just the _ gold _ flares ) have been reported , even in cases for which there are very few degrees of freedom . as a result ,",
    "some of the fluence values are poorly constrained , as reflected by the error bars .",
    "these reported fluence values do not include the contribution from the power law component of the spectral model that was used to approximate the underlying afterglow lightcurve contribution to the flare spectrum .",
    "in other words , the fluence values in column 6 of table [ tbl : fluence_table ] include only the contribution from the band function component of the spectral model fit to the flare data , excluding the frozen power law component from the underlying component .",
    "the fluence values in column 3 of table [ tbl : fluence_table ] include only the contribution from the unfrozen flare power law component of the spectral model fit to the flare data , once again excluding the underlying component .",
    "this is an important point to stress since most previous papers that quote a fluence for flares actually quote the entire fluence under the lightcurve .",
    "this practice is misleading because the underlying afterglow lightcurve sometimes contributes a large , and difficult to constrain , fraction of the total fluence .",
    "the reported fluence values are also corrected for effects due to incomplete light curves for some flares .",
    "for instance , if the tail end of a flare happened to be interrupted by an orbital gap or the south atlantic anomaly , the incomplete flare light curve would be extrapolated until it intersected with the extrapolation of the underlying light curve . in these cases , the error on this extrapolation was factored into the error on the fluence .",
    "the fluence calculations were done in the observed xrt energy band , which is 0.210 kev .",
    "since the x - ray flares emit the bulk of their energy in this band , we consider this to be the most reasonable approach .",
    "this fact is supported by the band function spectral fits that result in x - ray peak energies , and it is supported by the fact that the x - ray flares are typically weak to undetectable by higher energy and lower energy instruments such as bat and uvot .",
    "we computed the effect of extrapolating the typical flare spectrum into the higher energy band typically reported for _",
    "swift_-bat bursts .",
    "the median spectral parameters for _ gold _ flares that had a reasonable spectral fit were @xmath524 , @xmath525 , and @xmath526 kev ; where these refer to the band function lower energy photon index , higher energy photon index , and e - folding energy , respectively . from these values",
    ", it was found that extending the energy range from 0.2150 kev added only 1.4% to the fluence relative to the reported 0.210 kev value .",
    "this is insignificant compared to the error bars .    the overall distribution of flare fluences is shown in figure [ fig : fluence_distribution ] for the absorbed power law model and the absorbed band function model . once again , these fluences are for just the flare component .",

    "while it does seem clear that the flares involve a peak energy that is significantly lower than the more typical hundreds of kev observed for the initial grb prompt emission , it is not clear if there is a strong relationship of this peak energy with e@xmath636 , due to the large error bars and the limited sample .",
    "the relatively low e@xmath635 in the x - ray band is , of course , expected since the flares are observed as increases in the x - ray band , which are often not accompanied by measurable increases in other bands .",
    "unfortunately , due to the size of the error bars on e@xmath635 , it is not at all clear whether there is a relationship for the flares that is similar to the e@xmath635e@xmath636 correlation found for the prompt grb emission .",
    "the intriguing hint of a relationship evident in figure [ fig : epeak_eiso_gold ] will be explored in the future using more flares and broader spectral coverage .",
    "this sample contains 14 grbs that have a measured redshift .",
    "the redshift distribution is shown in figure [ fig : redshift_distribution ] .",
    "the mean redshift for these 14 grbs is z=2.6 .",
    "this is consistent with the mean redshift of all _ swift _ grbs , which is between 2.5 and 2.8 @xcite .",
    "this shows that the flaring grbs are not drawn from a significantly different redshift distribution than the overall sample of grbs .",
    "based on this sample drawn from the first 110 _ swift _ grbs , it is clear that significant x - ray flares are produced frequently and at late times . in this paper",
    "we have presented a detailed spectral analysis of 77 x - ray flares drawn from 33 grbs .",
    "some of these grbs had many flares ( we find 7 significant flares in two of these grbs , but there are probably even more temporally unresolved flares leading to observed intra - flare variability ) , while many grbs had only one or two flares .",
    "each of the flares was treated as an individual event , and properties of the entire sample of flares were presented .",
    "although several studies of individual flares have been published recently , this paper ( along with paper i ) provides a systematic study of a large sample of flares .",
    "furthermore , this paper is the first to correct for the effects of the underlying afterglow on the spectra of the flares . for the flares in which the fluence of the underlying lightcurve is a significant fraction of the fluence of the flare , the effect of the underlying photons on the flare spectra is significant .",
    "several spectral models were fit to each flare .",
    "these models included a simple absorbed power law , similar to the simple absorbed power law that typically fits the underlying afterglow lightcurve , as well as more complex models that are more akin to the spectral models that frequently provide a better description of grb prompt emission , such as the grb band function @xcite .",
    "for some flares , both simple and complex models provided a reasonable fit , while some flares had an improved fit by using a more complex model such as a band function .",
    "it is unlikely that the complete distribution of spectra was drawn from a pure power law distribution .",
    "spectra with curvature , such as the band function , could be related to the instantaneous source spectrum , but it should be noted that it could also be caused by temporal evolution of the spectrum during the flare ( this work averaged the spectrum over the entire flare ) since some flares have shown spectral evolution in time @xcite . in any case , this result is similar to the results found for prompt emission from grbs @xcite , in which power laws sometimes provided a reasonable fit to prompt emission while band functions provided a better fit to the overall sample .",
    "it was also found that the photon spectral indices of the flare spectrum did not always match those of the underlying spectrum and the distributions were different from one another . in those cases , this indicates a different population or mechanism for the production of the flare photons and the underlying afterglow lightcurve photons .",
    "this result provides further evidence that flares result from some form of internal engine activity , particularly when evaluated in conjunction with the small @xmath649 values and further temporal analysis reported in paper i , along with previous studies of individual bursts @xcite . within the context of the standard model",
    ", this would most likely involve very late internal shocks .",
    "these internal shocks could , in principle , arise from a distribution of lorentz factors for the shells from earlier internal engine activity , but this seems unlikely due to the inefficiency of the kinetic energy conversion that would result from these weak internal shocks @xcite .",
    "the late internal shocks are probably the result of late internal engine activity .",
    "this sample contained 14 grbs with a measured redshift , and the average redshift did not differ from the average redshift for all _ swift _ grbs , including those without flares .",
    "this implies that late flares can not be explained merely as redshifted multi - peaked emission from the initial prompt grb .",
    "this result is also supported by individual burst analyses that are corrected for redshift , such as that of @xcite in which a high redshift burst has very late flares in the burst rest frame .",
    "all of this implies that the large fluence values for flares reported in this paper ( sometimes comparable to the prompt grb emission , and typically @xmath510@xmath1 less than prompt grb ) must be produced at very late times with peak energies in the x - ray band .",
    "grb progenitor models must be capable of producing this emission within a comparable energy budget to that which was previously applied to only the prompt grb emission .",
    "the fallback of material onto the central black hole after a stellar collapse could last for long time periods @xcite and lead to late internal engine activity , but the reduced luminosity of this model at late times means that it can not explain all flares .",
    "several models for continued activity of the central engine have been proposed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these models , and others , must be evaluated within the context of the energy budget and the spectral parameters presented here .",
    "this work has also attempted to explore the relationship between @xmath633 and @xmath634 for flares , in an effort to see if the amati relationship @xcite is also present for flare events .",
    "this is necessarily restricted to flares for which the grb redshifts are known and the spectra have enough counts to constrain the parameters .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to only 18 flares ( 3 of which are from a short burst ) , and the parameters are not particularly well constrained , as shown in figure [ fig : epeak_eiso_gold ] .",
    "although a relationship may exist and there is an intriguing hint of a correlation similar to that reported by @xcite for grb prompt emission , it is impossible to come to any firm conclusion due to the limited sample and large error bars . by looking at more flares and analyzing data from more instruments over a wider energy band ( thus improving the @xmath633 constraint )",

    "<S> the origin of the flares can be investigated by comparing the spectra during the flares to those of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed all significant x - ray flares from the first 110 grbs observed by swift . from this sample </S>",
    "<S> 33 grbs were found to have significant x - ray flares , with 77 flares that were detected above the 3@xmath2 level . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper , a variety of spectral models have been fit to each flare . </S>",
    "<S> a portion of the x - ray flares had enough counts to allow complex spectral models , such as band functions , to be fit to the data . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectral fits favor a band function model , which is more akin to the prompt emission than to that of an afterglow . while some flares do release approximately as much energy as the `` prompt '' grb emission , we find that the average fluence of the flares is @xmath3 erg @xmath4 in the 0.210 kev energy band , which is approximately a factor of ten below the average prompt grb emission fluence . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the peak energy of the observed flares is typically in the soft x - ray band , as one should expect due to the selection of the sample from x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> these results , when combined with those presented in the companion paper on temporal properties of flares , supports the hypothesis that most x - ray flares are late - time activity of the internal engine that spawned the initial grb ; not an afterglow related effect . </S>"
