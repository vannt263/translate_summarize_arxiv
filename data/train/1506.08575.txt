    "the so - called @xmath0cdm model of cosmology has been very successful at explaining all cosmological observations with a minimal set of six cosmological parameters .",
    "these six parameters have recently been measured to an unprecedented accuracy with the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "several deviations from this simple model have been constrained to be relatively small @xcite .",
    "this model has been called the standard model of cosmology . however , despite its successes , the @xmath0cdm model contains at its core two unknown components .",
    "one being a very small cosmological constant and the other the so - called dark matter .",
    "this dark matter component is assumed to be cold , collisionless and does not interact with the other particles of the standard model of particle physics except gravitationally .",
    "it amounts to about one quarter of the total energy density budget of the current universe @xcite . furthermore , despite the many experimental searches for these dark matter particles , both on earth and in space , none was found up to now .",
    "see for example @xcite and @xcite ( and reference therein ) for reviews .",
    "the presence of these unknown energy components has motivated many studies that try to explain the phenomena that they give origin to , by modifying the law of gravitation without introducing new energy sources , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one recent interesting attempt to explain the dark matter phenomenon by introducing a modification to general relativity is the so - called  mimetic \" dark matter proposal @xcite . in this proposal ,",
    "general relativity is reformulated in terms of an auxiliary metric which is conformally related with the original  physical \" metric , where the conformal factor is a certain function of the new metric and the first derivative of a scalar field . in these new variables ,",
    "the theory becomes invariant under weyl rescaling of the new metric and therefore provides traceless equations of motion .",
    "this switches on a new conformal degree of freedom of gravity which behaves as an irrotational pressureless perfect fluid , i.e. it can mimic a cold dark matter component . in this model",
    ", the observed cold dark matter energy density would , in general , be the sum of two unknown amounts of energy density contributions , one coming from hypothetical dark matter particles and the other from the  mimetic \" dark matter which is only a gravitational effect .",
    "in a subsequent work @xcite it was shown that by introducing a potential for the new scalar field one can mimic the gravitational behavior of almost any form of matter ( see also @xcite for earlier work ) .",
    "@xcite considered the effects of higher - derivative interactions on the cosmology of the  mimetic \" dark matter model . in @xcite , the authors showed that the energy momentum tensor of the mimetic theory with higher - derivatives is actually of the imperfect fluid type and the theory can support vorticity .",
    "@xcite argues that these higher - derivative interactions could possibly help solving the small - scale problems of the cold dark matter model .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative conformal extension of general relativity , using a vector field , that can also support rotational flows for the mimetic dark matter .",
    "the stability of the  mimetic \" dark matter model was analyzed in @xcite , where it was shown that the positiveness of the energy density of the fluid is a sufficient condition for the absence of ghost instabilities .",

    "the invariance of cosmological perturbations under disformal transformations has been recently studied in for example @xcite and mimetic theories of modified gravity have been considered in @xcite and references therein .    in this paper",

    "mimetic \" dark matter theory .",
    "we will show that the invariance is broken exactly for transformations that satisfy the non - invertibility condition . in section [ sec : lm ] , we will demonstrate that the new mimetic general scalar - tensor theory equations of motion can also be derived by the use of a lagrange multiplier as in the general relativity case .",
    "we also briefly comment on the higher - derivative nature of the resulting equations . in section [ sec : eom ] , we shall present some applications of our results . for instance",
    "we will show that the simplest mimetic scalar - tensor model is able to mimic the cosmological background of a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model with a barotropic perfect fluid with an arbitrary equation of state .",
    "finally , section [ sec : con ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we use the metric signature @xmath11 and we set the reduced planck mass to unity .",
    "in this section , we will consider disformal transformations of very general scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "we will show that these theories are invariant under generic disformal transformations .",
    "however for a special subset of non - invertible disformal transformations the theory is modified resulting in new equations of motion which may possess novel solutions .      in this first subsection",
    "we will derive what is the condition for non - invertibility of a disformal transformation of the type @xmath12 where @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 @xmath3 and @xmath4 are arbitrary functions ( see footnote 1 ) of two variables .",

    "the issue of the non - invertibility for a conformal transformation in the context of  mimetic \" gravity was first discussed in @xcite and here we will generalize their arguments to disformal transformation in scalar - tensor theories .",
    "the conditions under which disformally coupled theories can be re - written in the so - called jordan frame were studied in @xcite .",
    "the inverse of @xmath5 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 for obvious reasons . using the previous equation",

    "this is because we would be relating ten variables of @xmath5 to eleven variables of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . despite this assumption , in the next subsection",
    "we will show that the condition we find here for non - invertibility of the transformation is the same as the condition found in the next subsection for the system of equations of motion to be indeterminate .",
