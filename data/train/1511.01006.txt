    "as known to the mathematics community , the evaluation of two familiar integrals , namely , @xmath1 and @xmath2 follow a rather ad hoc approach .",
    "the catch is that the integrand is rewritten in a manner that the transformed integral takes the form @xmath3 and then use the fact that @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath1 the numerator and the denominator of the integrand are multiplied by a factor of @xmath5 which brings the integral into the form in question .",
    "the draw back of the proceeding method is that it kind of require the knowledge of the solution even before it is evaluated . to over come this difficulty ,",
    "jacob and osler @xcite proposed an approach which use a very interesting geometric result given below .",
    "[ thm1]the area of triangle @xmath6 in figure 1 equals the area of trapezoid @xmath7 .",
    "this interesting result is not hard to prove by observing that the product of the height ( @xmath8 ) and base ( @xmath9 ) of any triangle such as @xmath10 or @xmath11 is a constant , thus making their areas keep fixed at @xmath12 , since one vertex of such a triangle is always lies on the curve @xmath13 .",
    "this observation is first made by james gregory in 1667 , according to osler @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] also suggests the following very important result @xcite .",
    "[ thm2]the area of sector @xmath6 under the curve @xmath13 is equal to the area @xmath7 under the same curve .",
    "the authors in @xcite use this observation to provide a novel geometric proof to the following identity which is normally proved using a similar ad hoc approach .",
    "[ thm3]@xmath14    this raises the question that whether we can proceed with a similar approach to the twin identity for @xmath15 .",
    "the purpose of the rest of this paper is to extend this idea to provide a geometric approach to the following sibling identity .",
    "[ thm4]@xmath16    the geometric proof of this result requires some additional observations .",
    "first we notice that as the integral @xmath17 corresponds to the curve @xmath13 , the integral @xmath0 corresponds to that of @xmath18 .",
    "thus the method of the proof consists of first transform the coordinates and then use theorem  [ thm2 ] as in the case of @xcite .",
    "first consider the familiar coordinate transformation which rotates the @xmath19cartesian plane about the origin through an angle of @xmath20 in the counter - clockwise direction to obtain the new axis of coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "for example , consider the rotation of @xmath19coordinates about the origin through an angle of @xmath23 in the clockwise direction . according to the eq .",
    "( [ tran1 ] ) , the transformed coordinates are given by      this , in turn , transforms the curve @xmath25 in the @xmath19plane to the curve given by @xmath26 in the @xmath27plane .",
    "the equation of the new curve takes the form @xmath28 , thus allowing us to use the theorem  [ thm2 ] in the transformed coordinate system",
    ". this result would be the key ingredient in proving theorem  [ thm4 ] above .",
    "lie on the curve @xmath18 , we have @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 but , by theorem  [ thm2 ] , this must be equal to the area of the region @xmath38 which we can evaluate in the transformed coordinate system . without loss of generality ,",
    "let the point @xmath34 be @xmath39 in the @xmath19coordinate system so that @xmath40 . in the @xmath27coordinate system",
    "the area in question is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "but notice that @xmath42 thus , we have @xmath43 now letting @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 as required .",
    "this completes the proof of the main result ."
