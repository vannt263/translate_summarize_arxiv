    "the critical properties of strongly interacting matter near the chiral transition at finite temperature and density are studied in first principle calculations using lattice simulations of qcd  @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach is offered by effective chiral models @xcite , like the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite and the chiral quark - meson ( qm )  @xcite models as well as the corresponding extended versions , which include the interaction of quarks with a uniform temporal gluon field .",
    "the latter , the polyakov loop extended nambu  jona  lasinio ( pnjl )  @xcite and quark - meson ( pqm )  @xcite models reproduce prominent features of qcd thermodynamics , obtained in lattice simulations . in particular , both models exhibit a chiral as well as a deconfinement transition .    in this paper , the consistency of mean - field calculations of many - body systems within chiral effective models like the njl / pnjl and qm / pqm models is addressed . in particular , we discuss the role of the lowest order fermion vacuum contribution . in the njl / pnjl model ,",
    "this term is responsible for the dynamical breaking of the chiral symmetry in vacuum and is therefore necessarily taken into account . on the other hand , in the qm / pqm model , the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry is due to the meson potential .",
    "hence , for qualitative considerations , the fermion vacuum loop is frequently omitted  @xcite .",
    "we show that a mean - field approximation , where the fermion vacuum term is neglected , commonly referred to as the no - sea approximation , leads to a distortion of the critical behavior at the chiral transition . in particular , in this approximation",
    "the order of the transition in the chiral limit is _ always _ first order .",
    "in contrast , when this term is included , the transition is of first or second order , depending on the choice of coupling constants and on the baryon density .",
    "differences in the thermodynamics between the njl and qm models found in the literature can be attributed to the use of the no - sea approximation in the qm model .",
    "for instance , in this approximation , the adiabatic trajectories obtained in the qm model exhibit a kink at the chiral crossover transition , while in the njl model they are smooth everywhere  @xcite .",
    "this effect is a trace of the underlying first - order phase transition of the qm model in the chiral limit , when fermionic vacuum fluctuations are neglected  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the omission of fermion vacuum fluctuations can result in a violation of the semi - positivity of the spectral function as well as in a violation of detailed balance  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum fermion fluctuations were also shown in the pqm model to considerably affect the structure of the phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the importance of fermion vacuum fluctuations for a consistent formulation of the thermodynamics of the qm and pqm models in the mean - field approximation .",
    "we show that , in order to reproduce the second - order chiral phase transition expected for two flavor qcd within these models  @xcite , it is necessary to take the fermion vacuum term in the thermodynamic potential into account and to perform a proper regularization of the divergence .",
    "furthermore , we also show that when the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken , the thermodynamics is strongly affected by the no - sea approximation . finally , we remove the infinities of the vacuum term using the dimensional regularization .",
    "the chiral qm model is used as an effective realization of the low  energy sector of qcd .",
    "the replacement of the @xmath0 local gauge invariance of qcd by a global symmetry in the qm model eliminates the possibility to address confinement within this model .",
