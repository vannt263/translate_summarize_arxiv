    "quantum computing is among the most intensively researched topics in modern physics.@xcite the need for scalability and long coherence times has spurred the development of spin - based solid state quantum bits ( qubits ) , @xcite which are inherently scalable and interact weakly with their environment .",
    "solid state spin qubits employ the nuclear spin of a donor , @xcite the spin of a quantum dot or donor - bound electron , @xcite or two - electron singlet and triplet states .",
    "@xcite among semiconducting host materials , si is promising due to its compatibility with si microelectronics , the absence of piezoelectric coupling to phonons and nuclear - spin free isotopes offering the possibility of isotopic purification to eliminate the hyperfine interaction leaving nearly pure @xmath2si .",
    "@xcite the outstanding spin coherence times of si @xcite have caused si - based devices to be energetically investigated .",
    "@xcite    at the same time , the study of localised spin systems with strong spin - orbit interactions has flourished in recent years , motivated by their potential for all - electrical spin manipulation .",
    "@xcite spin - based quantum computing schemes typically rely on static magnetic fields to achieve a splitting of the qubit states , and on radio - frequency ( rf ) magnetic fields to effect transitions between these states .",
    "static magnetic fields can be localised by using nanomagnets @xcite but localising rf magnetic fields is considerably harder . hence",
    ", a significant body of research has been devoted to accomplishing spin manipulation entirely by electrical means , such as electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) @xcite .",
    "many additional advantages of spin - orbit coupling have been identified . via coupling to electric fields and deformation potentials ,",
    "spin orbit coupling opens new channels for entanglement of spin qubits by direct coulomb interactions , photons , and phonons . when intrinsic spin - orbit coupling of the crystal is employed , complex fabrication of nano - magnets can be avoided , while also avoiding additional decoherence channels they may introduce .",
    "confined hole systems are ideal to explore spin - orbit coupling effects in localized spins .",
    "hole spin - orbit interactions are inherently strong , due to the orbital angular momentum @xmath3 of their constituent atomic wave functions , and holes are described by an effective spin-3/2 @xcite .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom of the spin-3/2  the quadrupole moment associated with the heavy hole - light hole coupling as well as the octupole moment  give rise to physics unique to holes : an alternating spin polarisation @xcite and interactions with an electric field quadratic in the effective spin.@xcite decoherence in hole systems can be less pronounced than in some electron systems , @xcite due to the suppression of the hole - nuclear spin contact interaction .",
    "@xcite thanks to these favourable properties , hole quantum dots and acceptors have been the focus of increasing attention , @xcite for example experiments have successfully measured the zeeman splitting of a single acceptor hole @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit coupling in conventional spin qubits enhances unwanted coupling to electric fluctuations arising from phonons and charge fluctuations , thus potentially destroying single- and two - qubit coherence .",
    "the fundamental question to be answered is whether strong spin - orbit must necessarily be associated with dephasing and the loss of quantum information,@xcite or whether quantum computation schemes could be devised in which electrical spin control by desired electric fields is enabled while dephasing due to unwanted electric fields is suppressed .",
    "the long - term aim of our work is therefore to devise a highly coherent localised spin - orbit qubit which can be operated and entangled purely through the use of electric fields . in particular",
    "it is important that the qubit be robust to electrical noise during both single qubit and two - qubit gates .",
    "protection during two qubit operations could prove to be very important since the exchange mechanism for entangling spin qubits is inherently vulnerable to dephasing by electric field fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we propose using holes bound to b : si acceptors implanted near an interface ( fig .",
    "[ device ] ) to realize highly coherent qubits that utilise both the spin and the charge degrees of freedom for enhanced functionality @xcite we discuss analytically the various hole interactions with the interface and electric fields and introduce their use in a new heavy - hole qubit , in a manner broadly analogous to our previously proposed light - hole qubit .",
    "@xcite we develop a theoretical picture unifying acceptor qubits and compare the heavy - hole and light - hole architectures in a way that illustrates the principles used in acceptor quantum computing .",
    "the greatest advantage of acceptors is their high degree of tunability using a gate electric field , which is due to the interplay of the dipole and quadrupole degrees of freedom inherent in the hole spin-3/2 .",
    "acceptors in si combine a series of additional desirable properties .",
    "the acceptor confinement potential is built into the device , the sharp confinement helps to reduce decoherence , and its shape is well understood and reproducible .",
    "moreover , devices based on single si : b acceptors have recently been demonstrated@xcite , and we expect that fabrication of future si : b devices will benefit from advances in ion implantation and stm lithography technologies used for fabricating si : p devices@xcite .    near an interface both heavy ( hh ) and light hole ( lh )",
    "spin qubits can be implemented allowing a degree of flexibility . in both architectures",
    "all - electrical quantum computing is enabled by the subtle interplay between bulk terms with @xmath4 symmetry and interface - induced rashba - like spin - orbit terms , which are tunable by a top gate . as compared to si electrons",
    ", holes do not possess a valley degree of freedom , which could interfere with qubit operation and entanglement .",
    "the key physics of interface - bound acceptor qubits is conveniently captured by an effective @xmath5 hamiltonian , which enables an analytical description , and is our central result : @xmath6 the basis used here is @xmath7 in the notation detailed in sec .",

    "the terms @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the in - plane electric and magnetic fields , while @xmath18 is the out - of - plane gate electric field .",
    "we provide an analytic model with an analytic solution , with parameters obtained from exact numerical solution to the 6x6 lk hamiltonian with cubic terms and split - off holes , and parametrized in terms of a series expansion in the gate - electric field .",
    "based on this hamiltonian and on numerical calculations , we demonstrate that b : si hole edsr is especially strong thanks to the interface - induced spin - orbit terms .",
    "the biggest challenge facing electrical quantum computation schemes is decoherence due to fluctuating electric fields @xcite . in b : si , at certain values of the gate electric field we identify sweet spots in the qubit dephasing rates due to charge noise , which are traced to hh - lh mixing , i.e. the quadrupole moment .",
    "the edsr term peaks close to the point where the dephasing time @xmath1 also peaks , implying high gate fidelity at the @xmath1 sweet spot .",
    "hence acceptor hole qubits can have better coherence times than certain quantum dot - based electron qubits .",
    "entanglement can be accomplished by coupling to a superconducting resonator , using the spin - orbit induced dipole - dipole interaction , or coulomb exchange @xcite .",
    "our proposed architectures are feasible by combining mature silicon nanofabrication technology with emerging schemes for single - dopant electronics @xcite .",

    "the key ingredients enabling full electrical control of acceptor qubits are the interface - induced spin - orbit terms , which may be regarded as the spin-3/2 equivalent of the rashba terms known in semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "these fall into two categories : a contribution due to the potential energy step at the interface , which has not been calculated before , and a contribution due to the interface electric field , which can be identified with the @xmath136-terms in ref .  .",
    "in spite of the overall similarities , the heavy - hole qubit that has been the focus of this paper is described by a qualitatively different effective hamiltonian than the one in ref .  .",
    "this is because it relies on the spin - diagonal zeeman interaction with an out - of - plane magnetic field , since hh have vanishing zeeman interactions for in - plane magnetic fields . on the other hand , the light - hole qubit of ref .",
    "has spin off - diagonal zeeman interactions because the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the interface - induced spin quantization axis .",
    "the in - plane @xmath132-factor can be sizeable thanks to couplings between the heavy holes and the light holes .",
    "in part due to these qualitative differences , the physical origin of the sweet spot in @xmath1 is different for the two systems . for the lh qubit with an in - plane magnetic field a very generic reason for the sweet spot can be identified , namely the non - perturbative hh - lh mixing near the anti - crossing , where the qubit states comprise a @xmath194 spectral amplitude of light holes and a @xmath195 spectral amplitude of heavy holes . moreover , for an out of plane applied magnetic field , the lh qubit architecture would not exhibit a sweet spot in @xmath1 . the sweet spot for the hh qubit , on the other hand , is not liable to a simple explanation .",
    "it is absent if @xmath196 is artificially set to zero , even for @xmath197 , which is not a restriction on the realization of the sweet spot for the lh qubit .",
    "the two qubits we have introduced in this work and in ref .   can be controlled solely by electrical means . quite generally in both cases ,",
    "the location of the qubit with respect to the interface is important in achieving a high degree of electrical tunability .",
    "having the qubit too close to the interface is not ideal because the hh - lh splitting @xmath198 becomes very large , suppressing hh - lh mixing terms . at the same time it is undesirable to have the qubit too far from the interface , since the @xmath199 term increases linearly with @xmath200 .",
    "the ground state is a hybrid between triangular and spherical eigenstates and the anti crossing between the two becomes very sharp ( narrow ) at large values of @xmath199 .",
    "@xcite this latter shortcoming can be compensated using strain .",
    "@xcite    two notable quantitative differences stand out between the hh and lh qubits .",
    "firstly , as compared to the lh qubit , the effective edsr dipole moment for the hh qubit is weaker by a factor of approximately 30 .",
    "this is compensated by the fact that for the exact same physical setup the hh qubit is considerably less sensitive to noise than the lh qubit , exhibiting much longer dephasing times around the sweet spot .",
    "furthermore , the second order term in the noise electric field is expected to be much smaller for the hh qubit because the curvature of the larmor frequency as a function of gate electric field is considerably smaller .",
    "this fact , and the quantitative description of dephasing , will be addressed in detail in a future publication .",
    "overall , the lh qubit has more extreme performance characteristics , since it allows for larger drives to be obtained , giving more gate operations per @xmath128 .",
    "however , it is harder to make , requiring strain .",
    "moreover , obtaining larger drive strengths requires deeper acceptors , such that the sweet spot has a narrower window of operation where @xmath201 .",
    "the hh qubit on the other hand allows fewer gate operations per @xmath128 , since around the sweet spot @xmath202 is limited by @xmath203 @xmath124s , allowing 100 qubit operations compared with @xmath204 for the lh qubit .",
    "however , it has a much larger window in which the charge noise @xmath205 , and it does not require strain , simplifying the fabrication . at the same time , for the hh qubit , to a first approximation the zeeman interaction with an in - plane magnetic field vanishes , therefore a magnetic field perpendicular to the interface is needed to split the qubit states .",
    "such a perpendicular field may affect the @xmath206-factor of a superconducting resonator used in entanglement via circuit qed .",
    "in that case it will be preferable to use dipolar coupling for entanglement , a scheme for which we have found no obvious restrictions .",
    "finally , we note that two - qubit gates , mediated by dipole - dipole interactions or cqed and producing entanglement , can either be turned `` on '' and `` off '' , by varying the gate electric field , or alternatively , `` always - on '' interactions could be employed@xcite .",
    "the `` on '' behaviour is obtained at the finite - field sweet spot , where edsr - mediated cqed and dipole - dipole interactions are strong .",
    "the `` off '' behaviour is obtained by adiabatically sweeping at the @xmath207 ( zero - field ) sweet spot where edsr is considerably weaker , see fig .",
    "[ fedsr ] .",
    "although couplings @xmath208 between the light and heavy holes are present at @xmath207 due to the interface , the @xmath209-induced light - heavy hole mixing vanishes , and as such , the @xmath208 interactions do not couple into the qubit subspace as edsr interactions .",
    "alternatively , several schemes exist which can provide a universal set of operations , without the ability to dynamically modulate two - qubit interactions .",
    "the relative merits of these two schemes follow from their requirements ; tuning the interactions requires control of individual qubits between the two sweet spots , while `` always - on '' interactions consume additional physical resources@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied an interface - bound silicon acceptor - spin qubit driven by a rashba - like spin - orbit interaction induced by the interface .",
    "we have demonstrated that quadrupolar terms in the qubit interaction with the electric field are the source of sweet spots in the dephasing time , which enhance the qubit immunity to charge noise .",
    "the spin off - diagonal terms induced by the interface enhance edsr significantly , which allows efficient manipulation entirely by means of electric fields .",
    "entanglement by means of dipole - dipole interactions or cqed is inherently scalable thanks to the noise immunity of the qubit .",
    "the rashba - like spin - orbit interaction terms improve the possibility of building a true spin qubit in solid state quantum computing platforms .",
