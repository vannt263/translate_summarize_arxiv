    "dwarf galaxies ( with absolute bolometric magnitudes , @xmath9 ) are the most abundant in the universe , and their properties differ significantly depending on the local density : unlike the field , where most of dwarfs are star forming , the red , passive population dominates in the clusters , suggesting that the environment preferentially acts in quenching the star formation .",
    "the general consensus is that it is a complex mixture of both",

    "deep spectroscopic surveys to study dwarf galaxies in high - density environments of different physical properties are needed to constrain the physical mechanisms influencing dwarf evolution and to better understand the environmental effects on their evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have undertaken a campaign of deep spectroscopic observations of nearby clusters down to the dwarf regime ( @xmath10 ) in order to infer accurate cluster membership and study the properties of low - mass galaxies , such as star formation histories and orbital parameters .",
    "the richness class 1 cluster abell 85 ( a85 hereafter ) is a nearby ( @xmath11 ) and massive cluster ( @xmath12mpc and @xmath13 * ? ? ?",
    "it is one of the brightest clusters in the x - ray sky @xcite with a smoothed gas distribution .",
    "it has been extensively studied in the whole electromagnetic spectrum : in the radio @xcite , in the optical @xcite and in the x - ray ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main cluster hosts an x - ray bright , metal - rich cool core and it is well known that a85 is not completely virialized .",
    "its substructure was analysed in the literature at different wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found that a85 shows a complex x - ray temperature structure , and @xcite detected an extended x - ray peak in the south - west of the cluster .",
    "moreover , other two abell clusters , a87 and a89 , are close in projection to a85 @xcite .",
    "the former is also the nearest and is more likely to be a series of groups moving towards the main body of a85 @xcite .",
    "both the x - ray emission and the optical galaxy distribution trace an elongation of the cluster orientation towards the a87 direction .",
    "therefore , a85 is a perfect starting point for our project due to its physical characteristics together with a few practical reasons : its sky region is covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , so bright galaxies ( @xmath14 ) already have spectroscopic information , allowing us to focus on the faint ones , and its proximity favours deep spectroscopic and large area coverage at the same time .",
    "the galaxy luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) gives the number density of galaxies of a given luminosity .",
    "it is a powerful observable to study the characteristics of galaxies and to compare environments of different densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the faint end seems to be shaped by the environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , making deep spectroscopic study of dwarf galaxies and the comparison between those in field and clusters fundamental .",
    "the schechter function @xcite is commonly used to fit the lf of galaxies .",
    "this function is exponential at the bright end and a power law at the faint end .",
    "however , its universality is still a matter of debate . while it is a good fit to some ( spectroscopic ) observations of clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a linear combination of two schechter functions is needed in other cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a85 lf shares common features with the spectroscopic field lf by @xcite , in particular a similar faint - end slope .",
    "the main difference between the a85 and the field lf is the nature of the low - mass galaxies .",
    "thus , red dwarfs dominate the cluster faint end of the lf while blue faint galaxies are more abundant in the field .",

    "the remaining spectra had too low @xmath30 to estimate reliable redshifts .",
    "formal errors of this task are smaller than true intrinsic ones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is because the error on the redshift estimate depends on several factors .",
    "first of all , the resolution of the grating used in the observations , which , in this case , gives a sigma around 650700 kms@xmath34 at 5000 @xmath36 with slits of 1 arcsec .",
    "note that this is the expected value for the resolution of vimos , which is worse than the resolution of af2 .",
    "other sources of uncertainty are the wavelength calibration , errors in the cross - correlation and errors in the centring of the targets .",
    "the convolution of these can be evaluated only by comparison of different measurements of the same objects .",

    "we found that in the range v@xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the cluster recessional velocity and @xmath42 its velocity dispersion , only 14 galaxies are discarded by the caustic method ( see section [ memb ] ) .",
    "given that the number of non - member galaxies is relatively low for such a large velocity interval , we are confident that the bias in the cluster membership determination is negligible .    combining our data with redshifts from the sdss - dr6 and nasa / ipac extragaalctic database ( ned ) catalogues results in a total number of 1603 redshifts in the magnitude interval @xmath43 , within 1.4@xmath29 and for galaxies bluer than @xmath44 .",

    "[ lf_pop_rad ] ) .",
    "the relative contribution of the galaxy subsets changes with clustercentric distance .",
    "blue , star - forming and recent arrival galaxy densities are smaller in the central region and similar in the external one .",
    "this feature indicates that the presence of the dip can be the result of the evolution of galaxies in the cluster environment .",
    "indeed , it is not present where a small fraction of galaxies is still star forming or blue . in other words , cluster members in the outer region",
    "have not yet fully experienced the effects of cluster environment .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the mass function with redshift and the effects of the environment on it .",
    "they analysed different sets of galaxies and , in particular , they traced the blue and star - forming galaxies and the red and passive ones .",
    "they proposed a model where two types of quenching occur and depend on the mass of the galaxy itself .",
    "one of them affects massive galaxies and is called _ mass quenching _ , while the other is effective at low - mass ranges and it is called _",
    "environmental quenching_. in the case of passive and red objects , they needed a double schechter function to model the data and concluded that the two mathematical components of the fit shape the two processes . applying this interpretation to a85",
    ", we have two components that depend on the clustercentric distance and we called bright and faint components .",
    "we have the faint one with increasing weight towards the outskirts .",
    "its relative contribution to the total luminosity in the radial bin ( whole cluster ) changes from the 2% in the inner radial bin to the 22% in the outer one .",
    "similar trend is observed with respect to the total luminosity of the cluster , even if weakened : the faint population passes from 1 to 7% .",
    "consequently , the bright component shows a decreasing teen inside - out .",
    "the radial variation of the @xmath80 parameter highlight these different contributions .",
    "in particular , the trends of the red , blue , passive and star - forming subsets agree with the results of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lfs of recent - arrival and not - virialized populations are fitted by a single schechter , while the lfs of the respective dominant populations  e.g. virialized and early - infall",
    " are better represented by a double schechter .",
    "this suggests that the latter population has spent enough time within the cluster potential to have produced their two components .",
    "normalizing the lf is useful in order to compare its shape among systems of different richness .",
    "a variety of normalization factors has been used in literature , and we analyse here their effects on our study .",
    "we first normalized the lf by scaling it with total luminosity integrated over the full range of magnitudes .",
    "we note that it is common practice to restrict the integration over few magnitudes at the bright end of the lf .",
    "this choice is supported by the environmental invariance of the bright end ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "we normalized the radial lfs of a85 using factors from the literature .",
    "in particular , we used the ranges @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "[ lf_cfr_norm ] shows , we obtained similar faint - end slopes , but different relative number densities of dwarfs .",
    "note that if the magnitude range used for the normalization includes intermediate luminosity galaxies , they are equalized by construction , so no studies on their radial properties can be made .",
    "therefore , we strongly suggest to use the total luminosity as normalization factor and perform a complete and unbiased analysis of the environmental dependence of the lf .",
    "the results on the bright end of the normalized lf of a85 confirm previous outcomes from the literature : it is independent of environment ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this independence is likely a result of dynamical friction .",
    "massive / luminous galaxies suffer of large dynamical friction entering the cluster potential , falling into the central region of the cluster on short time - scales .",
    "there , they merge with the bcg , giving a small fraction of luminous members ( @xmath147 ) in the inner radial bin .",
    "note that dynamical friction can also explain other properties of this galaxy population observed and analysed in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "dwarf galaxies are the most affected by environmental processes .",
    "their shallow potential well impedes them from retaining their gas once in the cluster .",
    "for the same reason , tidal stripping efficiently remove stellar mass .",
    "the main physical processes acting on the gas component are starvation @xcite and ram pressure @xcite , while the change in mass and/or morphology are mostly ascribed to harassment @xcite and strong tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "what the dominant processes in clusters are is still an open question , and the analysis of the faint end of the lf helps to put some constrains .",
    "several literature outcomes show a dependence on the environment of the faint - end slope on photometric lfs . indeed ,",
    "early - type lfs are steeper in the outer regions of a cluster ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result was recently confirmed with the spectroscopic stellar mass function of a medium redshift cluster ( see * ? ? ?",
    "photometric cluster lfs also show steeper slopes than the field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicating an excess of dwarf galaxies in high - density environments .",
    "this result is considered a probe supporting the evolutionary link between dwarf galaxies and clusters .",
    "there are only a handful of deep , spectroscopic observations of nearby clusters , in which cluster - to - cluster variations of the shape of the lf are observed : virgo and abell 2199 lfs do not show any upturn at the faint end @xcite , unlike a85 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the radial analysis of @xcite does not present a significant dependence of the lf on clustercentric radius , but opposite trends in the radial variation of @xmath80 between virgo and abell 2199 . indeed",
    ", the characteristic luminosity seems to be fainter at small radii for abell 2199 , while virgo shows a trend similar to a85 ( see section [ lf_comp ] ) .",
    "these observed cluster - to - cluster variations may depend on the formation history , the evolution of the large - scale environment or on the cluster mass . indeed , ( * ? ?",
    "* see in particular their fig.1 ) hint a relation between the shape of the lf and the mass : more massive clusters show steeper slopes and more complex shapes .",
    "being a85 the most massive and its lf the steepest among the three clusters , this seems to indicate that we spectroscopically observed this relation .",
    "however , a wide spectroscopic survey of nearby clusters spanning a large range in masses will be necessary in order to put constrains on this and on the physical processes that give rise to these variations .",
    "@xcite also studied the red and blue populations and compared their lfs to the field spectroscopic ones by @xcite .",
    "the two subsets show common features , including compatible slopes and the upturn for the red lfs . however , the dominant population at the faint end is different in the two environments : blue dwarfs are dominant in the field while red low - mass galaxies are dominant in the cluster .",
    "they concluded that the processes quenching star formation are playing a key role in this cluster .",
    "the present analysis on the lf of a85 finds similar results : red and passive lfs show the upturn , and the presence of the dip requires the modelling by a double schechter function , while blue and star - forming galaxies are well represented by a single schechter function .",
    "however , they have compatible faint - end slopes , suggesting again that the dominant mechanisms do not act on the size and/or the mass of the dwarfs .",
    "indeed , a recent orbit analysis on simulated virgo - like cluster found that only a small fraction ( 20 - 25% ) of low - mass galaxies suffers from substantial stellar mass loss due to harassment @xcite .",
    "moreover , our radial study found that the number density of late - type dwarfs is barely changing with radius , while the density of early - type galaxies is decreasing inside - out .",
    "these results indicate a transformation of the nature of dwarf galaxies due to the quenching of their star formation .",
    "in addition , the dominant mechanisms are more effective in the centre of the cluster where the hot intracluster medium is denser .",
    "the evolution of dwarfs is then led by starvation and ram - pressure stripping .",
    "photometric studies of the lf in radial bins indicate a variation of the faint end for the red population @xcite .",
    "however , our analysis does not confirm this result .",
    "the normalized lfs shown in fig .",
    "[ lf_pop_norm ] highlight that the variation of the lf is at intermediate luminosities , whereas it is statistically insignificant at the faint end .",
    "the result that finds spectroscopical confirmation is the variation of @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , the characteristic luminosity of the red lf moves towards brighter values in the external cluster region ( compare the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ lf_pop_norm ] with fig .",
    "11 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to cluster - to - cluster variations , a wider spectroscopic sample of nearby clusters is needed to quantitatively discuss the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic results .",
    "the results presented in this work show that the lf of a85 changes with the clustercentric distance at the intermediate magnitude range @xmath148 . in addition , cluster and field lfs differ within the same range , giving a clear environmental dependence for the evolution of intermediate luminosity galaxies",
    ". this dependence could be the consequence of the orbital distribution of these galaxies due to dynamical friction .",
    "moreover , the large velocity dispersion of a85 inhibits mergers .",
    "therefore , this type of galaxies will survive for a long time in eccentric orbits ",
    "i.e. with large apocentres ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the lf of a85 is dominated by red , passive and early - infall galaxies also at the magnitude range analysed here .",
    "these galaxies have passed near the cluster centre at least once ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the intermediate galaxy population has suffered quenching of star formation due to the long time spent within the cluster potential .",
    "we have identified 460 cluster members of the nearby ( @xmath149=0.055 ) cluster a85 down to @xmath150 , thanks to deep spectroscopic observations .",
    "this data set allowed us to study the total and radial spectroscopic lfs of this cluster .",
    "the global lf and the lf dominant galaxy population ",
    "i.e. red , passive , virialized and early - infall galaxies  were fitted by a double schechter function and they present a dip . these results point towards the presence of two galaxy populations in the cluster : a bright and a faint one .",
    "their fraction depends on the clustercentric distance . indeed , the faint component is more important in the outskirts of the cluster . in the central region of a85 ,",
    "the lfs do not show a dip and the faint galaxy populations only represent @xmath151 of the total galaxy density .",
    "also blue and star - forming galaxies are a small fraction in this region .",
    "this result can indicate that the quenching of the star formation fills the dip observed in the external lfs .",
    "the normalized lfs of a85 show that the bright and faint ends are independent of the environment .",
    "moreover , they are similar to the field ones . in contrast",
    ", the intermediate luminosity galaxies ( @xmath8 ) present an important dependences on the environment .    considering these results together , we suggest that hydrodynamical mechanisms are the main drivers of the dwarf evolution in a85 .",
    "these processes transform blue low - mass galaxies into red ones with no significant changes in their mass / luminosity or size .",
    "the distribution of the bright and intermediate luminosity galaxies is due to dynamical friction .",
    "therefore , the former suffer the largest dynamical friction , fall to the central region and eventually merge with the bcg on a short time - scale .",
    "moreover , the bright end is independent of the environment .",
    "in contrast , the intermediate luminosity galaxies present a clear environmental dependence .",
    "this difference suggests that they survive in the cluster for several gyr on eccentric orbits around the centre thanks to small dynamical friction .",
