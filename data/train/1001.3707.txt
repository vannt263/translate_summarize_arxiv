    "nuclear spin dynamics has been studied extensively in many fields.@xcite in recent years , nuclear spin dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots has attracted intense interest because of the excellent quantum coherence properties of nuclear spins .",
    "indeed , nuclear spins in nanostructures have been suggested as qubits for a quantum computer@xcite and for use as quantum memory.@xcite for either purpose , high degree of nuclear spin polarization ( nsp ) is a pre - requisite .",
    "nuclear spins in nanostructures also form an important environment for electron spins , which have been proposed as a candidate for qubits.@xcite through the hyperfine interaction the nuclear spins create a spatially and temporally fluctuating magnetic field for the electron spins , which leads to spin decoherence.@xcite it has been suggested theoretically that such decoherence could potentially be suppressed if nuclear spin fluctuations are suppressed,@xcite and one way to realize such suppression is via dynamic nuclear spin polarization .",
    "furthermore , the coupled electron - nuclear spin problem is an intriguing example of a quantum many - body problem , and is still not solved completely .",
    "dynamic nuclear spin polarization ( dnsp ) has been studied for many decades.@xcite it has been demonstrated in semiconductor quantum wells@xcite and quantum dots @xcite through a variety of experiments .",
    "physically , dnsp can be achieved either electrically or optically , where a pumped electron can transfer its spin polarization to nuclear spins via the contact hyperfine interaction .",
    "a range of values for nuclear spin polarization has been reported by several experimental groups .",
    "for example , using electrically controlled dnsp , petta _ et al .",
    "_ reported approximately 1 % nsp in lateral coupled gaas double quantum dots;@xcite while baugh _ et al .",
    "_ reported 40 % nsp in vertical coupled gaas quantum dots with 5% in.@xcite with optically pumped dnsp , gammon _ et al .",
    "_ reported 60 % nsp in interface fluctuation gaas quantum dots,@xcite while recent experiments have achieved nsp in in@xmath0ga@xmath1as self - assembled quantum dots at various magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , approximately @xmath2 of nsp is created in in@xmath3ga@xmath4as quantum dots < 1 t,@xcite 40% in in@xmath5ga@xmath6as at around 2 t,@xcite and 80% in in@xmath3ga@xmath4as at 5 t. @xcite it is evident that the experimental results vary greatly as experimental conditions and physical systems are varied .",
    "so far there has been no systematic theoretical studies of nsp and how it depends on the various system parameters such as applied field and material composition .    in this paper",
    "we study dynamic nuclear spin polarization in in@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum dots via optical pumping of confined electrons .",
    "these self - assembled dots are generally highly strained , and we are particularly interested in the nsp of these dots in different strain environments .",
    "specifically , the strain breaks the cubic symmetry of the crystal lattice and creates an electric field gradient which couples to the nuclear quadrupole moment,@xcite which in turn leads to mixing of nuclear spin eigenstates .",
    "we use a simplified model of the quantum dot where the electric field gradient is axially symmetric .",
    "we first study how the as nsp responds to various strain strengths , angles and cotunneling constants in magnetic fields .",
    "for the electron - nuclear spin transfer , we consider both phonon - assisted and cotunneling - assisted spin flip processes .",
    "lastly , we consider nsp of in@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum dots with different compositions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the scheme of dnsp in section [ sec : scheme - of - nuclear ] , and our model hamiltonian in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "we show our results of nuclear spin polarization in as nuclei and in different compositions of in@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum dots at various magnetic fields in section [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "we discuss some interesting features related to our calculation in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec : conclusion ] and draw our conclusions .",
    "in@xmath0ga@xmath1as self - assembled quantum dots ( saqds ) are formed by a strain - driven process , where the strain arises from the lattice mismatch between the inas deposition layers and the gaas substrate .",
    "the strain in the quantum dots ( qds ) breaks the lattice symmetry and creates electric field gradients in the dots .",
    "the shape of in@xmath0ga@xmath1as qds varies among experiments , ranging from pancake - like to pyramid - like and dome - like .",
    "the resulting distribution of electric field gradients thus also differs from dot to dot . even in the same dot , the strain distribution is not uniform .",
    "for example , the strain at the edge of a quantum dot is generally larger than at the center of the dot.@xcite therefore nuclear spins in different regions of a qd experience electric field gradients of different strengths and directions . for an estimate of nsp , we start with a simplified model of a pancake - like cylindrically symmetric qd as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sadthe - geometry - of ] .",
    "the electric field gradients in such a dot are thus axially symmetric . the largest electric field gradient @xmath7 is along the principal axis @xmath8 , which is defined to be normal to the pancake surface .",
    "for instance , for a lattice site in the @xmath9 plane , @xmath8 would be in the @xmath9 plane as well , and deviates from the growth direction ( the @xmath10-axis ) by an angle of @xmath11 .    a model of a self - assembled quantum dot .",
    "we assume the field gradients in the self - assembled quantum dot are axially symmetric .",
    "the largest electric field gradient component @xmath7 is along the principal axis @xmath8 , which deviates from the growth direction ( the @xmath10-axis ) by an angle @xmath11 .",

    "schematic of the setup for a typical optical orientation experiment.@xcite the self - assembled quantum dot is embedded in a schottky diode heterostructure , where the gate voltage is tuned to allow only one electron orbital state below the fermi level .",
    "nuclear spins are polarized by an optically pumped electron captured in the quantum dot . ]",
    "we base our calculation on the experimental conditions in refs .",
    ", , , ( see fig . [",
    "fig : encelectron - nuclear - spin - coupled ] ) , where the saqd is embedded in a schottky diode heterostructure , so that the charged states of the qd can be controlled .",
    "in addition , the gate voltage can be tuned to allow zero or one charge ( electron or hole ) on the dot .    in such a system dynamic nuclear spin polarization",
    "is realized via optical pumping .",
    "a circularly polarized photon creates an electron - hole pair , which is then captured in the qd as a negative trion,@xcite neutral exciton,@xcite or positive trion.@xcite when the qd contains one electron , this electron is likely spin polarized and can polarize a nuclear spin through the hyperfine interaction . the probability to realize this spin transfer process depends on the experimental conditions , such as the type of excitation used ( pulsed or cw ) and the initial charged states in the quantum dot ( @xmath12 , @xmath13or @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , an experimentally determined factor @xmath15 is used to modify the electron - nuclear spin transfer probability ( see [ sec : model ] c ) .    in a finite magnetic field",
    "the hyperfine - mediated transfer of polarization from the electron spin to the nuclear spins has to be assisted by another process because of the large mismatch of the electron and nuclear zeeman energies .",
    "in our case we consider phonon - assisted and tunneling - assisted processes .",
    "more specifically , in the schottky - diode configuration the confined electron can flip its spin via cotunneling to the external reservoir ( for details see [ sub : cotunneling - processes ] ) .",
    "this cotunneling - assisted spin flip process is efficient at low magnetic fields . in the high field regions ( or in an isolated qd ) , the electron - phonon interaction provides the more efficient channel to compensate for the energy mismatch between electron and nuclear spins ( for details see [ sub : electron - phonon - interaction ] ) .",
