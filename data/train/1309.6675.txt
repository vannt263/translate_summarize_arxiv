    "thermal expansion ( te ) and magnetostricton ( ms ) can provide accurate information on changes in the dimensions of materials as the temperature and magnetic field are varied .",
    "these quantities are of considerable interest because of the fundamental importance of the structure of materials and their intimate relation to the specific heat of materials@xcite .",
    "they provide a way to understand the pressure dependencies of the respective ordering phenomena , thermodynamic properties , relevant energy changes , and magnetic field - induced structural changes , which are very important for the study of high temperature superconductors @xcite , heavy fermion systems@xcite and many other novel materials .",
    "unfortunately , many samples of interest are frequently small with a correspondingly small te or ms , so a dilatometer with a high resolution is needed for these measurements .    currently , the dilatometers based upon the capacitance method are one of the most sensitive methods for precise te and ms measurements@xcite",
    ". dilatometers of this design have operated successfully in a wide variety of different cryostats and measurement systems .",
    "their main advantages are that the sample is only under very weak uniaxial stress ( 50 - 500 mn)@xcite and that a dilation limit of less than 0.1@xmath2 can be reached@xcite .",
    "however , when placed into a low temperature environment that changes from liquid to gas ( as inside a he-3 cryostat ) or even in a dilution refrigerator mixing chamber where the ratio of @xmath3he to @xmath4he changes with temperature or field , the capacitance dilatometer has large background effects due to the temperature dependent dielectric constant of the medium .",
    "in addition , in a pulsed magnetic field , where the field is changing extremely rapidly , eddy currents in the metallic body of the device can have deleterious effects .",
    "finally , many capacitance dilatometers will change their capacitance upon rotation of the device due to the effect of gravity even without the sample length having changed , making their use in rotators difficult@xcite .    to solve these problems ,",
    "several solutions have been proposed .",
    "one is an optical fiber strain gauge using fiber bragg gratings ( fbgs ) .",
    "this method has the significant advantage of immunity to electromagnetic interference and works very well in a wide variety of cryostats and large pulsed magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "however , the fbg has to be glued to the surface of the sample and this requires that the sample has a flat surface at least a few millimeters in length which is not possible with many samples .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to rotate the device and bend the optical fiber .",
    "the solution proposed here uses an atomic force microscope piezo - resistive cantilever as the sensing element .",
    "the prototype construction was described earlier@xcite and is here developed into a more robust device .",
    "a significant advantage of this device is its immunity to the effects of the cryogenic media it is immersed in . in addition , the cantilever is small and easy to mount in a relatively small space and can be easily rotated .",
    "another advantage is the ability to perform simultaneous mulit - axis measurements . for previous dilatometer forms ( capacitive and optical ) , dilations of the sample",
    "can only be measured one axis at a time . with proper construction , more",
    "than one cantilever can be used at the same time and measured separately in order to detect the simultaneous changes of different axes of one sample ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 and even @xmath7 axis .",
    "this work concentrates on the following aspects : finding suitable construction materials and design , exploring low noise and high - quality measurements , and discovering applications and limitations for this method .",
    "the dimensions of the commercial prc400 @xcite device measure 3.5@xmath81.6@xmath80.2 mm@xmath3 ( l@xmath8w@xmath8h ) overall and the sample lever arm has dimensions of 0.4@xmath80.05@xmath80.005 mm@xmath3 ( l@xmath8w@xmath8h ) .",
    "@xmath9 indicates the resistance of piezoelement of the long - tip lever arm and @xmath10 is the resistance of a short - tip reference lever which is synthesized together with the signal piezo element .",
    "the typical room temperature resistance of each piezo ( both @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) is about 600 - 700 @xmath11 . as shown in fig.[1 ] ( b ) , the basic measurement circuit of is based on a wheatstone bridge configuration .",
    "resistance changes in the piezoelement @xmath12 that are induced by dimensional changes from the sample are recorded as a voltage signal in a lock - in amplifier .",
    "@xmath13 is the input excitation voltage and @xmath14 is the recorded output signal . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the potentiometers used to balance the bridge .",
    "the equation is : @xmath17    a top - loading @xmath3he/@xmath4he dilution refrigerator and superconducting magnet were used to provide temperatures as low as @xmath1825 mk and magnetic fields up to 16 t. the dilatometer is immersed directly in the @xmath3he-@xmath4he mixture providing excellent thermal contact to the sample .",
    "construction for a 2-axis measurement .",
    "( a ) the silicon stage with two cantilever tips touching the sample surface . the cantilever arm and tip , piezo element @xmath12 and reference piezo @xmath19 are indicated .",
    "( b ) the construction the wheatstone bridge circuit .",
    "@xmath13 is the output voltage , and @xmath14 is the recorded signal .",
    "the circuit within the red box has been synthesized by a low noise circuit bridge , designed and built by the nhmfl electronic shop .",
    "( c ) image of the measurement setup as two cantilever tips touch the two surfaces of @xmath0 separately as illustrated by ( a ) . ]    for designing this dilatometer , there are two basic rules : first , the design must be very simple , since any strain in the construction can transfer to the output signal , and the sample signal will normally be hidden by this huge effect .",
    "second , it should be made of the same material as the cantilever body . if the materials are different , the differential contraction between the arm and the base can cause the cantilever tip to `` walk '' over the surface of the sample and produce erroneous signals .",
    "the final design of sample stage is made of silicon and the height of the stage where the sample sits is machined according to the thickness of the sample .",
    "the cantilever and sample are both glued to the silicon base with superglue and the sensory tip of the cantilever gently touches the sample surface .",
    "this simple design is especially suitable for thin samples with very limited length , @xmath20 @xmath18 0.1 mm or smaller . for a bulk sample with larger size , by using multiple cantilevers , the dilations of more than one sample direction",
    "can be measured simultaneously .",
    "the 2-axis measurement setup is shown as an example in fig.[1 ] ( a ) and with proper construction , measuring a 3@xmath21 axis is also possible .",
    "fig.[1 ] ( b ) shows the wheatstone bridge circuit construction .",
    "this part is synthesized in a custom manufactured low noise breakout box .",
    "this approach dramatically reduced the connections and exposed wires that can introduce unwanted noise .",
    "signal recovery ( sr ) 7280 lock - in amplifiers are used here .",
    "typical settings were @xmath13 = 0.05 v with time constant 500 ms and excitation frequency f = 17 hz . with the improved circuit , the peak - to - peak noise level can be reduced down to 20 nv .    in capacitance dilation measurements , @xmath22 represents the sample length and @xmath23 is used to quantify the change . in the dilatometer measurements described here , results are recorded in the form of electronic signal , voltage .",
    "the signal @xmath14 can reflect the deviation of the cantilever tip @xmath23 . at room temperature",
    ", the calibration from @xmath14 to @xmath23 can be made by using a micrometer to push the cantilever tip ( record @xmath23 ) and recording the electrical signal ( @xmath14 ) at the same time .",
    "however the calibration relation is not as easily obtained for low temperature environments .",
    "there is an important factor which will dramatically influence the calibration , that can best be described in terms of the  cell effect \" .    in a capacitive dilatometer ,",
    "the cell effect is caused by the thermal expansion and magnetostriciton of the material(s ) making up the dilatometer . in the cantilever dilatometer ,",
    "the cell effect originates from two piezoresistors that do not match .",
    "the two resistors were presumably engineered to be identical at room temperature and in zero fields . what has been observed , though , is that small differences between them increase at low temperatures ( slightly different temperature - dependent resistivities ) and high fields ( slightly different magnetoresistances ) . to create a new term",
    ", this might be called a  resistor mismatch cell effect \" .",
    "based on the tests of several cantilevers , this kind of cell effect can clearly vary from cantilever to cantilever .",
    "so for low temperature calibration , the conversion form @xmath14 to @xmath23 can not be a universal value for all cantilevers .    in spite of this , for repeated measurements with one single cantilever ,",
    "the cell effect is rather reproducible .",
    "most of the time , the cell effect is shown as a very broad bump or nearly linear background signal throughout the whole measurement range .",
    "most of the dilation changes that are associated with phase transitions can be easily resolved as anomalies in the broad background signal .",
    "a rough estimation was made measuring one sample with both capacitance and piezo dilatometers . under the same conditions ( pressure , temperature and magnetic field )",
    ", the dilation change appeared to be comparable .",
    "here we use the same @xmath0 sample which is used in correa s magnetostriction measurements@xcite . according to their capacitance dilatometer measurements , at approximately 25 mk , for b//@xmath24-plane and original sample length @xmath25 mm , the dilation change @xmath26 at the transition point",
    "@xmath27 is @xmath28 nm . the voltage signal @xmath29 at the same transition point is @xmath30 @xmath31v .",
    "so the calibration relation can then be estimated as @xmath32    this estimation agrees with the room temperature value found in the reference@xcite within a factor of 2 ( prc400 , with @xmath13=0.05 v ) .",
    "in fact , because the different cantilevers have different  cell effect \" , the signal at the transition point is also affected .",
    "we performed measurements on the same @xmath0 sample using different cantilevers . at the transition point",
    ", the largest @xmath29 signal could be up to twice large as the smallest one .",
    "the @xmath29 shown above is an average value .",
    "therefore , this calibration relation can be used for some rough estimations , but can not be used to determine absolute sample length changes .    with equation [ eq2 ]",
    ", we can estimate our low temperature measurement resolution .",
    "as previously mentioned , the lowest peak to peak noise level is @xmath18 20 nv , so the best resolution we can achieve is @xmath182 @xmath2 . with this calibration , the temperature and field dependence of the cell effect also can be roughly estimated to be @xmath183 nm / kelvin and @xmath181.5 nm / tesla respectively .",
    "these are average values obtained by measuring 3 different cantilevers .",
    "note these estimated values only apply for low temperature measurements in the millikelvin range .",
    "this cell effect includes the result of resistor mismatch , piezoresistor magnetoresistance , the expansion of silicon , etc .",
    "but in fact , for many low temperature measurements , one is interested in measuring a phase transition or seeing quantum oscillations , and this cell effect could be subtracted as the background signal . so despite the `` cell effect '' , this technique is still very useful for detecting dilation changes caused by phase transitions for samples with limited size .",
    "moreover , for samples that are large enough , a very useful simultaneous multi - axis measurement can be performed with the setup shown in fig.[1 ] ( a ) .",

    "both groups contains four curves that are taken at @xmath33 = 5@xmath34 , 10@xmath34 , 20@xmath34 , 90@xmath34 respectively . as can be seen , the transitions for these two groups of data correspond to each other . at the transition point , the signal , @xmath29 for the @xmath47(@xmath48)-axis is more than 10 times larger than the signal for @xmath35-axis . for clarity ,",
    "the @xmath6-axis of the graph was split and data for @xmath47(@xmath48)-axis are decreased by a factor of 10 in order to get a similar scale with the data for @xmath35-axis . for the measurements performed on the @xmath35-axis , even though a different cantilever was used than in section iii , the signal amplitude for both measurements are still comparable , despite the different background caused by the cell effect .",
    "thus for the measurements along the @xmath47(@xmath48)-axis , the large @xmath29 at the transition point indicated the dilation change along @xmath47(@xmath48)-axis is much bigger than that along @xmath35-axis given the crystal dimensions .",

    "the sample and field position are similar to the @xmath0 sample shown in fig.[cecoin5 ] bottom .",

    ", data from @xmath1 with the field parallel to the @xmath35-axis is shown . in the lower part of the graph , a fast fourier transform ( fft ) spectrum for the @xmath1 analysis for fields between 4 t and 12 t is shown .",
    "the upper graph shows the clear oscillation data up to 12 t. the quality of this data is typical for all of the investigated trace curves in fig.[larhin5 - 2 ] .",
    "multiple frequencies are found in the fft spectrum ; main fundamental branches are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in addition to high resolution , this cantilever dilatometer can be easily rotated in the cryostat . for quantum oscillation measurements ,",
    "the data taken at different angles will reflect the fermi surface at that direction , so obtaining the angular dependent data is important for understanding the full fermi surface . because of the confined space and liquid / gas environment at field center , sample rotation in other dilation measurements is rather limited .",
    "however , this piezo cantilever dilatometer does not have these restrictions , making it the perfect choice to perform angular dependent measurements at low temperature and high field .    figures [ larhin5 - 2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the angular dependence of the oscillation frequencies of @xmath1 , both in the fft spectra and selected peaks from those spectra .",
    "the branches @xmath56 ( @xmath57=1 , 2 ) and @xmath53 roughly follow the 1/@xmath58 dependence , where @xmath33 indicates a field angle tilted from [ 001 ] to [ 100 ] . in comparison to the theoretical calculation in shishido s paper@xcite",
    ", this angular dependence suggests that the corresponding fermi surface is nearly cylindrical . because of the theoretical calculation , branch @xmath51 is due to a band 15-electron fermi surface , which is nearly cylindrical , but corrugated , allowing maximum and minimum cross - sections .",
    "branch @xmath59 is due to a highly corrugated band 14-electron fermi surface .",
    "a feature of @xmath59 is a minimum in its frequency at @xmath1830@xmath34 from the @xmath35-axis .",
    "this feature is shown in our data in fig.[larhin5 - 2 ] ( b ) .",
    "branch @xmath60 is due to a band 13-hole fermi surface whose topology is similar to a lattice . in previous studies@xcite , these low frequency signals have never been clearly shown .",
    "however , by using the cantilever dilatometer , the low frequency features are well resolved in the oscillatory magnetostriction measurements .",
    "the angle - dependent quantum oscillations in @xmath1 at @xmath1825 mk for a wide angle region have been successfully observed and shown in fig.[larhin5 - 2 ] .",
    "it is clearly found that these main frequencies which are corresponding to certain fermi surfaces , systematically shifted with rotation angle @xmath33 .",
    "the significant signals at low frequency range may need further investigation .",
    "angular dependence of the frequency in @xmath1 .",
    "( a)fft spectra at different angle and ( b ) selected peaks vs. angle . ]",
    "advancing our previous work , we improved the design implementation of the miniature size afm cantilever based dilatometer .",
    "the successful applications of our new design on heavy fermion sc samples @xmath36 show that the cantilever dilatometer is a very useful tool for magnetoelastic and quantum oscillation investigations . compared to the traditional capacitance dilatometer and fbgs ,",
    "although this dilatometer can not provide accurate length changes of a sample , it still has unique merits .",
    "first , the sample used for this dilatometer can be very small ( smaller than 0.1 mm in length ) .",
    "this is already beyond the limitations of many other dilatometer forms .",
    "also , the rotation measurement is usually considered to be a big challenge for capacitance and fbgs dilatometers .",
    "since the volume of the piezo dilatometer can be rather small , it can be easily rotated in very constrained spaces , like field center in a dilution refrigerator , without gravity effects , providing another advantage for this technique .",
    "its versatility makes it suitable for measurements under the many conditions imposed by low temperatures ( like liquid or gaseous helium ) and high magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , this technique shows suitability of application in oscillatory magnetostricton measurements , measuring even high frequency signals easily .",
    "the final advantage of our dilatometer is shown by the successful application on simultaneous multi - axis dilation measurements .",
    "the dilation measurement for more than one direction at the same time is difficult for other dilatometer techniques , which makes our cantilever dilatometer a unique tool for this type of measurement .",

    "<S> this dilatometer has been tested at temperatures down to 25 mk and in magnetic fields up to 16 t. the layered heavy fermion superconductor @xmath0 and its non - magnetic analog @xmath1 have been measured to demonstrate its use in detecting phase transitions and quantum oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , using this dilatometer , a simultaneous multi - axis dilation measurement has been done . </S>",
    "<S> this compact dilatometer has many advantages such as its ability to measure very small samples with lengths at sub - mm levels , low temperature and field dependence , ability to rotate , and works well irrespective of being in a changing liquid or gas environment ( i.e. within a flow cryostat or mixing chamber ) . </S>"
