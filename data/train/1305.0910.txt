    "the physical reasons of these treatments can be explained as follows : for the first value of the shell thickness , in spite of the fact that the electron is confined inside the core region for both @xmath17 and @xmath18 cases , the well region influences the energy levels even for small values of the well width .",

    "<S> in this study , we have investigated the photoionization cross section of an on - center hydrogenic impurity in a multi - layered spherical quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic energy levels and their wave functions have been determined fully numerically by shooting method . </S>",
    "<S> also , we have calculated the binding energy of the impurity by using these energy values . </S>",
    "<S> the photoionization cross section has also been computed as a function of the layer thickness and normalized photon energies . </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed in detail the possible physical reasons behind the changes in the binding energies and photoionization cross section . it is observed that both the binding energies and the photoionization cross sections depend strongly on the layer thickness and photon energies . </S>"
