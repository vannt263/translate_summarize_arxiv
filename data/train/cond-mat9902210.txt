    "in a ferromagnet , domains with different directions of the magnetization are favored by the long - range magnetic dipolar interaction .",
    "the boundary between the domains , the domain walls ( dw s ) , are a source of magnetoresistance that recently has attracted experimental@xcite and theoretical interest.@xcite    for ballistic systems , where the electron mean free path is longer than the system size , first - principles band - structure calculations have shown that the dw resistance is enhanced due to the nearly degenerate bands at the fermi energy.@xcite the rotating magnetization direction causes an effective potential barrier for the electrons which increase the resistance .",
    "recently large dw resistance in ballistic ni nanocontacts has been measured@xcite in agreement with the predictions in ref .  .",
    "in the diffuse transport regime cabrera and falicov@xcite interpreted transport through a single dw as a tunneling process and the corresponding mr was found to be exponentially small .",

    "it has been suggested by ruediger et al.@xcite that the experimentally observed negative dw resistance is an extrinsic effect caused by the interplay between orbital effects due to the internal magnetic fields and surface scattering .",
    "recently , it was also demonstrated that the large negative domain wall resistance of co films@xcite is due to mr resistivity anisotropy.@xcite    it is the purpose of the present paper to give a detailed account of the transport through a domain wall both in the ballistic and the diffuse regime in a two - band stoner model . in the ballistic transport regime",
    ", the transport through the magnetic domain wall can be treated by an adiabatic approximation similar to the one used for transport through a quantum point contact . in the diffuse regime",
    "we will use the diagrammatic technique introduced in ref .   and generalize it to the case of asymmetric impurity scattering life - times ( but without localization effects@xcite ) and screening of the domain wall potential .",
    "our results , although more general , reduce in the case of strong spin splitting to results that are very similar to those obtained in ref .   using a boltzmann equation .",
    "we explain why the results of the two methods differ .",
    "some results have been published already in a brief report and a conference proceedings.@xcite here we give an in depth discussion of the results including the technical details of the derivations .",

    "the ballistic transport regime is discussed in section [ s : ballistic ] and the diffuse transport regime in section [ s : diffuse ] .",
    "we give our conclusions in section [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendices include the adiabatic approximation which can be used in the ballistic situation , recipes for the calculation of the frequency summation of the feynman diagrams , and the spin - spiral case which can be exactly diagonalized .",
    "throughout , we will use an effective 2-band model to describe the ferromagnet with the hamiltonian @xmath0 { \\bf \\psi } _ 0({\\bf r } ) , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the bohr magneton , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the pauli spin matrices , @xmath4 is the effective magnetic field arising from the electronic exchange interaction , the magnetic dipole interaction , and the external magnetic field and @xmath5 is the 2-component spinor wave function .",

    "<S> we study transport through ballistic and diffuse ferromagnetic domain walls in a two - band stoner model with a rotating magnetization direction . for a ballistic domain wall , </S>",
    "<S> the change in the conductance due to the domain wall scattering is obtained from an adiabatic approximation valid when the length of the domain wall is much longer than the fermi wavelength . in diffuse systems , the change in the resistivity is calculated using a diagrammatic technique to the lowest order in the domain wall scattering and taking into account spin - dependent scattering lifetimes and screening of the domain wall potential . </S>"
