    "it is enough to construct only two vertices : @xmath5 which represents @xmath6 , and @xmath7 which represents @xmath8 @xcite . in this representation string fields @xmath9",
    "are realised as ket - vectors @xmath10 in the fock space .",
    "the vertices @xmath11 are defined up to two normalization factors that can be absorbed in to the charge and string field redefinitions .",
    "the main difficulty in actual calculations with vertices @xmath12 is that they are defined by infinite - dimensional matrices @xcite . to perform real calculation one can use finite dimensional approximation of these matrices @xcite .",
    "one calls this method as the oscillator level truncation method .",
    "an alternative method is the field level truncation method which originates from @xcite .",
    "this method was used with great success in refs .",
    "@xcite for tachyon potential calculations .",
    "the quartic term in the tachyon potential can be also obtained from the born zero momentum 4-point csft - diagram @xcite .",
    "it can be also computed within the oscillator level truncation method and the result is in a good agreement with the tachyon potential obtained within field level truncation method .    to justify more the oscillator level truncation method it is worth to check within this method some exact relations . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed to check descent relations between string vertices .",
    "descent relations @xcite relate n - string vertices , @xmath13 in a natural way : @xmath14 in ref . @xcite it was found that these relations has the form @xmath0 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the appearance @xmath16 in descent relations is considered as an anomaly .",
    "we ll discuss this interpretation in section 2 . in order to understand the origin of the @xmath16 breaking one has to investigate the vertex descent relations in more details .",
    "it is true that one can not a priori expect @xmath17 for arbitrary vertices @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we present a self - consistence scheme to define vertices @xmath21 in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath22 which obey ( [ descrel31 ] ) . for vertices defined via overlap equations one can not expect ( [ descrel31 ] ) since solutions of overlaps are defined up to a number . generally ,",
    "instead of ( [ descrel31 ] ) one has the descent relation of the form @xmath23 this factorization was found in @xcite as a result of direct calculations with vertices in continuous @xmath24-basis @xcite .",
    "note that it is more convenient to care out some calculations analytically when the matrices are presented in the diagonal form in the continuous @xmath24-basis @xcite .",
    "we verify the descent relation for @xmath25 and @xmath26 in section 3 . in the first case",
    "the calculation is similar to that of @xcite and gives @xmath27 without any truncation . in the second case we use two schemes in the ghost sector , one ( labeled by ( 1 ) ) with an overlap equation for the mid - point insertion and the second ( labeled by ( 2 ) ) without this trick .",
    "both our schemes differ from @xcite in the way we treat the ghost zero modes .",
    "these schemes give the descent relation in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are level @xmath31 dependent constants . for @xmath32 the matter",

    "we get the normalization @xmath2 as @xmath35 .",
    "we numerically prove that @xmath36 has a finite limit as @xmath37 in both our schemes .",
    "the surprising fact is that in two different schemes of calculations we get two different limits , namely @xmath38 in the scheme with overlap and @xmath39 in the scheme without overlap .",
    "the second result @xmath40 coincides with the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "in the operator representation string fields @xmath9 are realized as ket vectors @xmath10 in the fock space @xmath42 of matter and ghost modes . for",
    "the discussion below it is convenient to use a graphic representation similar to a standard diagram technique used to calculate vacuum expectation values of products of wick monomials . in this technique a wick monomial is represented by an arrow , so that creation operators correspond to the arrows going to the left and annihilation operators  to the arrows going to the right . here for simplicity we use one arrow for all creation or annihilation operators of a string .",
    "so we represent bra vectors by a point with the right arrows and ket vectors by a point with the left arrows , i.e. we represent a state @xmath10 as    ( 150,30 ) ( 1,22 ) ( 24,23.5)(-1,0)10 ( 23.85,22.45 )    to formulate witten s theory @xcite it is necessary and sufficient to introduce only two vertices : @xmath43 which represents @xmath6 , and @xmath44 which represents @xmath8 .    in the graphic notations @xmath7 is represented by an arrow outgoing from a circle to the right    ( 150,30 ) ( 35,22 ) ( 50.3,22.1)@xmath45 ( 52,23.1)(1,0)10    and @xmath46 is represented as    ( 150,30 ) ( 19.7,23.3)@xmath45 ( 21.5,24.3)(1,0)10 ( 49.8,23.3)@xmath47 ( 50,24.3)(-1,0)10 ( 55,23.3 ) ( 62,23.3)@xmath45 ( 63.68,24.4)(1,0)10(73.5,23.3)@xmath47    the witten vertex @xmath48 is represented by three arrows outgoing from a common point .",

    "let us consider the terms proportional to @xmath232 and @xmath233 : @xmath234 where we define @xmath235 for the correct structure of vacua it s necessary but not sufficient to fulfil the condition @xmath236 . by numerically calculations :",

    "we again get some new matrices @xmath239 .",

    "hence we got that the descent relation in the ghost sector has the following form @xmath255 here we restore the coefficients which were dropped above .      the normalization @xmath2 in the descent relation @xmath256 consists of two factors : ghost @xmath257 and matter @xmath258 ones , i.e. @xmath259 . in the ghost sector in the `` overlap calculations '' the normalization is @xmath260 in the `` non - overlap calculations '' we got @xmath261 in the matter sector we have the following normalization factor @xmath262 in ( [ gamma - matter ] ) the matrix @xmath263 is the neumann matrix for matter @xcite .",
    "this result was given in @xcite and we checked its accuracy . because of the simple structure of the vertices in the matter sector one can directly use @xcite without any intermediate calculations .",

    "we have the following fits for these graphs : for the first , `` overlap calculations '' we have @xmath264 ; for the second , `` non - overlap calculations '' we have @xmath265 .    to conclude we calculate the descent relation for @xmath256 using two different schemes .",
