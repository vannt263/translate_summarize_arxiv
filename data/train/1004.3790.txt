    "in many areas of mathematics , the space of parameters of a family of mathematical objects is itself an object of the same type .",
    "a well - known example of this phenomenon in dynamics is the mandelbrot set , whose local geometry reflects the geometry of the julia set of the quadratic polynomial corresponding to a given point .    the goal of this paper is to study a family of dynamical systems known as @xmath0-continued fraction transformations , showing that the intervals in parameter space where a stability condition holds can themselves be described by means of regular continued fraction expansions .",
    "the family @xmath1}$ ] of @xmath0-continued fraction transformations has been defined in @xcite ; the most striking feature of this family may be that the entropy @xmath2 is not a monotone function of the parameter @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) , and it is not even smooth everywhere .    rather , nakada and natsui ( @xcite ) showed that the entropy is locally monotone on intervals @xmath3 of parameters which satisfy the following matching condition @xmath4 as well as some other technical conditions .",
    "such intervals will be called _ matching intervals _ , and their union will be referred to as the _ matching set_.    in @xcite , nakada and natsui exhibited three infinite families of matching intervals , where the entropy is , respectively , increasing , decreasing , and constant . moreover , they conjectured :    [ conj ] the matching set has full measure in @xmath5 $ ] ( hence it is dense ) .",
    "a numerical study of the conjecture has been carried out in @xcite : the goal of this paper is to prove the existence of the structures numerically observed there , thus proving conjecture [ conj ]",
    ".    the main tool to analyze the matching set will be regular continued fraction expansions ; in fact , this matching set can be perfectly described without even mentioning the dynamics of @xmath0-transformations .",
    "let us briefly explain why .",
    "it is well known that any rational value @xmath6 can be expressed as a finite continued fraction expansion of either even or odd length .",
    "this fact , usually perceived as a nuisance , will give us the chance to perform the following `` natural '' construction :    1 .   for any rational number",
    "@xmath7 $ ] we consider its two regular continued fraction expansions , namely : @xmath8 = [ 0 ; a_1 , \\dots , a_{n } - 1 , 1 ] \\qquad a_n \\geq 2\\ ] ] we will associate to any such @xmath9 the interval @xmath10 whose endpoints are the quadratic surds @xmath11 \\qquad [ 0 ; \\overline{a_1 , \\dots , a_{n}-1 , 1}]\\ ] ] such an @xmath10 will be called the _ quadratic interval _ generated by @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   we will consider the union of all quadratic intervals @xmath12 } i_r\\ ] ]    the object of section [ quad ] will be to understand the structure of the open dense set @xmath13 , which can be summarized in the    [ first ] the set @xmath13 has full lebesgue measure in @xmath14 $ ] , but its complement has hausdorff dimension @xmath15 .",
    "although the family of quadratic intervals @xmath16 will have substantial overlapping , there is a subfamily that covers @xmath13 exactly .",
    "more precisely , a quadratic interval @xmath10 will be called _",
    "maximal _ if it is not properly contained in any other quadratic interval .",
    "it turns out that every quadratic interval is contained in some maximal one , and distinct maximal quadratic intervals do not intersect ( lemma [ strongmil ] ) : thus @xmath13 is the disjoint union of this collection of maximal intervals .",
    "this suggests that @xmath14\\setminus \\mathcal{m}$ ] should have a cantor - like structure ; this is only partially true because @xmath14\\setminus \\mathcal{m}$ ] is not perfect .",
    "indeed , the presence of isolated points is a consequence of the _ period - doubling _ phenomenon ( see subsection [ 2x ] ) : if @xmath17\\in \\mathbb{q}$ ] with @xmath18 odd and @xmath10 is a maximal quadratic interval , then @xmath19<r$ ] generates @xmath20 which is maximal as well , and the quadratic surd @xmath21 $ ] is a common endpoint , which is obviously not contained in any quadratic interval .    in the second part of the paper ( section [ acf ] )",
    "we prove that that this set @xmath13 is closely connected to the matching intervals .",
    "more precisely we prove    [ second ] let @xmath22 $ ] such that @xmath23 is maximal .",
    "then there exist positive integers @xmath24 such that @xmath25 moreover , the entropy function @xmath26 is monotone on @xmath23 .",
    "the proof of the theorem relies on the fact that an _ algebraic matching condition _ stronger than ( 1 ) holds everywhere on @xmath13 ; by theorem [ first ] , this condition holds for almost every parameter .",
    "moreover , the set defined by the algebraic matching condition contains the matching set defined by nakada and natsui and the difference between them is countable ( see appendix ) , hence they have the same measure and conjecture [ conj ] follows .",
    "our method also gives us an explicit control over the combinatorics of matchings : given any rational number , we are able to determine which maximal interval it belongs to and the _ matching exponents _ @xmath27 , hence the local behaviour of entropy ( constant , increasing or decreasing ) .",
    "conversely , one can use such knowledge to produce families of matching intervals with prescribed properties .",
    "finally , section [ strtec ] contains a few technical tools we use throughout the paper , including a criterion to compare purely periodic quadratic surds ( string lemma [ stvsts ] ) and an explicit characterization of either of the finite continued fraction expansions which generate a maximal quadratic interval ( lemma [ slsa ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the phenomenon we describe is strongly reminiscent of the theory of circle maps ( see e.g. @xcite , chap . 7.2 . ) : in that case , around each rational rotation number , in the parameter space there is a region ( arnold tongue ) where the dynamics is still periodic ( mode - locking ) , in such a way that on the critical line the complement of the union of all arnold tongues has measure zero ( even though its hausdorff dimension is strictly smaller than @xmath15 , differently from our case @xcite ) .",
    "recently s. katok and i. ugarcovici have studied another family of transformations , called @xmath28-continued fractions , which seem to share various features with the transformation @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) : it would be worth investigating more closely the connection between these systems in order to see whether the two different approaches can lead to a deeper understanding of both .",
