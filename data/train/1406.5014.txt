    "recent measurements of not - so - small value of the reactor neutrino mixing angle have opened up new windows to probe leptonic cp violation ( lcpv ) @xcite .",
    "establishing lcpv is one of the most challenging tasks in future neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the pmns neutrino mixing matrix @xcite is presented by @xmath0 unitary matrix which contains , in addition to the three angles , a dirac type cp violating phase in general as it exists in the quark sector , and two extra phases if neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "although we do not yet have compelling evidence for lcpv , the current fit to neutrino data indicates nontrivial values of the dirac - type cp phase @xcite .",
    "several experiments have been proposed or being scheduled to establish cp violation in neutrino oscillations @xcite . in this situation",
    ", it must deserve to investigate possible size of lcpv detectable through neutrino oscillations . from the point of view of _ calculability",
    "_ , it is conceivable that a dirac type lcpv phase may be calculable with regards to some observables @xcite . in this letter ,",
    "we propose possible forms of neutrino mixing matrix that lead us to estimate the possible size of lcpv phase , particularly , in terms of two neutrino mixing angles _ only _ , in the pdg - type standard parametrization @xcite .",
    "the estimation of lcpv phase is carried out by the following procedures :    *   constructing the neutrino mixing matrix with appropriate cp phases so as to accommodate the current neutrino oscillation data in such a way to perturb conventional ( tri-)bimaximal matrix . *   deriving the master formulae linking the dirac - type cp phase with neutrino mixing angles from the equivalence principle that any forms of neutrino mixing matrix should be equivalent to the standard parametrization of the pmns mixing matrix .    as will be shown later , the neutrino mixing matrices we adopt at the first step contain a maximal mixing angle which plays a crucial role in deriving the relations among neutrino mixing angles and dirac - type cp phase in the standard parametrization . substituting values of neutrino mixing angles into those equations obtained at the second step ,",
    "we perform numerical analysis on observables for the lcpv and present the results .",
    "in the leading order approximation , the conventional neutrino mixing matrices in the flavor basis can be given by @xmath1 taking @xmath2 to be either @xmath3 or @xmath4 leads to the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing @xmath5 or bimaximal mixing @xmath6 , respectively @xcite although the tri - bimaximal and/or bimaximal ones are theoretically well - motivated patterns of the neutrino mixing matrix , they are challenged by the current experimental results for three neutrino mixing angles . while the bimaximal mixing has already been ruled out by the non - maximal mixing for the solar angle , the current measurements of non - zero @xmath7 definitely disfavor the exact tri - bimaximal mixing .",
    "since the measured values of @xmath7 have been turned out to be of order of the required deviation of @xmath8 from maximal , the tri - bimaximal mixing can be treated on the same footing with the bimaximal mixing as leading order approximation of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the simplest possible forms of the neutrino mixing matrix without cp phases deviated from the ( tri-)bimaximal mixing patterns are given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the unitary matrix corresponding to the rotation with the angle @xmath11 in @xmath12 plane .",
    "please note that @xmath13 can be achieved in a neutrino model with a flavor symmetry by breaking it down to two different residual symmetries preserved in the neutrino and the charged lepton sector respectively @xcite .",
    "in such a model , @xmath10 in the upper ( lower ) form of eq.([phno1 ] ) is arisen from appropriate breaking of the residual symmetry of the mass matrix in the neutrino ( charged lepton ) sector by adding a bearking term in ( i , j ) and ( j , i ) entries of the mass matrix .",
    "once the mixing angle @xmath11 can perturbatively be treated @xcite , then eq . ( 2 ) possibly gives rise to non - zero value of the reactor angle as well as deviation from the maximal for the solar angle . as will be shown later , eight forms among twelve possible ones in eq .",
    "( [ phno1 ] ) are in consistent with present neutrino data within @xmath14 c.l . in this respect ,",
    "we call those eight forms of the neutrino mixing matrix _ minimally - modified ( tri-)bimaximal _ ( m(t)bm ) parameterizations .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that those forms of the neutrino mixing matrix keep a column or a row in ( tri-)bimaximal mixing matrix unchanged , which may be regarded as a remnant of a possible horizontal symmetry leading to ( tri-)bimaximal mixing .",
    "the column vectors orthogonal to the @xmath15-th and @xmath16-th ones in @xmath17 are unchanged for @xmath18 , whereas the row vectors orthogonal to the @xmath15-th and @xmath16-th ones are unchanged for @xmath19 .",
    "the multiplication of @xmath10 represents unitary transformation of the symmetry operator which corresponds to the rotation of two column vectors in the mixing matrix .",
    "thus , a symmetry argument can still be applied to the origin of the neutrino mixing matrices in the m(t)bm parameterizations .",
    "since the dirac - type cp phase @xmath20 is accompanied by @xmath7 in the standard parametrization , it is natural to involve cp phases when construct neutrino mixing matrix so as to generate non - zero @xmath7 .",
    "interesting points in this work based on the simplest forms of neutrino mixing matrix aforementioned are that @xmath7 is related with either @xmath8 or @xmath21 , and @xmath20 can be related in the standard parametrization with two neutrino mixing angles as long as we identify the m(t)bm parameterizations with the standard one .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to predict the dirac - type cp phase with complex perturbations @xmath22 containing a phase @xmath23 . among the above twelve forms of the mixing matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ phno1 ] ) , the forms @xmath24 and @xmath25 still lead to vanishing reactor mixing angle , and thus predict no cp violation .",
    "we do not consider these cases any longer .",
    "therefore , all the possible forms of the mt(b)m mixing matrix eligible for our aim are presented as follows ; @xmath26 while the cases ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) have been studied in @xcite , the other cases have not been considered yet . for the completeness of possibility",
    ", we here propose a general way to extract dirac - type cp phase from all possible forms given in eq.([phno3 ] ) , and show that not only the cases ( a ) , ( c ) , ( e ) but also the other cases ( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) are still viable from the recent fit of neutrino mixing angles up to @xmath14 c.l .",
    "now we demonstrate how to derive @xmath20 in terms of neutrino mixing angles in the standard parametrization .",
    "this can be done from the equivalence between one of the parameterizations in eq .",
    "( [ phno3 ] ) and the standard parametrization , shown in eq .",
    "( [ standard ] ) .",
    "assuming that neutrinos are majorana particles , we begin by explicitly presenting the pmns neutrino mixing matrix in the pdg - type standard parametrization as follows @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a @xmath0 phase matrix .",
    "note that one of three phases in @xmath29 is redundant .",
    "incorporating phase matrices @xmath30 defined above , the neutrino mixing matrices in eq .",
    "( [ phno3 ] ) are given by @xmath31 without those two phase matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in general , we can not equate the m(t)bm parameterizations with the standard parametrization given in eq .",
    "( [ standard ] ) .",
    "please note that such bi - unitary transformation is regarded as a general basis change of leptonic fields @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between both parameterizations dictates the following relation , @xmath34 applying @xmath35 and @xmath36 to cases a , b , g and h , we obtain the relations between the solar and reactor mixing angles , @xmath37 those relations indicate that non - zero values of @xmath38 lead to @xmath39 for case  a and @xmath40 for case  b . while the results for case  a are well consistent with the current experimental values of @xmath41 at @xmath42 c.l .",
    ", those for case ",
    "b are so at @xmath43 c.l .",
    "it turns out that the above relations for cases g and h are not consistent with experimental results up to @xmath44 c.l . , and thus ruled out .",
    "similarly , we get the relations between the atmospheric and reactor mixing angles from @xmath35 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 we see that non - zero values of @xmath47 lead to the values of @xmath48 for cases  c and e and @xmath49 for cases  d and f. they turned out to be consistent with experimental values of @xmath50 at 2@xmath51 c.l .",
    "now , let us derive the relations among @xmath20 and neutrino mixing angles in the standard parametrization .",
    "since the same method can be applied to all the cases , we only present how to derive the relation only for case  a . from the components of the neutrino mixing matrix for case  a , we see that @xmath58 applying the relation ( [ rel1 ] ) and @xmath59 to eq .",
    "( [ rela-3 ] ) , we can get the relation @xmath60 presenting @xmath61 in terms of the neutrino mixing angles as well as @xmath20 , and taking the real part in eq .",
    "( [ a - final ] ) , we get the equation for @xmath20 as @xmath62 notice that the imaginary part in eq .",
    "( [ a - final ] ) is automatically cancelled . using the above formulae",
    ", we can easily derive the leptonic jarlskog invariant as follows ; @xmath63)^2                    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{8 } \\sin ( 2\\theta_{12})\\sin(2\\theta_{13})\\sin(2\\theta_{23})\\sin\\delta_d \\label{jak } \\\\            & = & \\frac{1}{12 ^ 2}[8s^2_{13}(1 - 3s^2_{13})-\\cos^2 2\\theta_{23 } c_{13}^4 ] , \\label{jcp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where eq.([jak ] ) is obtained @xcite by just inserting the entries of @xmath64 given in eq.([standard ] ) .    by taking the same procedure described above ,",
