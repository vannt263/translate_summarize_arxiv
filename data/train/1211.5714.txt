    "the type of models that have been studied up to now fall into two categories .",
    "the first is _ tensor models _ , an uncolored simplicial @xmath0 example being : @xmath1 where the complex tensor over @xmath2 can be graphically associated to a triangle with edges labelled by @xmath3 , and the interaction has the combinatorics of the gluing of four triangles along edges to form a tetrahedron .",
    "the coloring of the same model with additional labels on the tensors could be used to define interactions with a @xmath4 invariance , corresponding to more general polytopes @xcite .",
    "the second is _ tensorial group field theories _ , an uncolored , simplicial 3d example being the boulatov model : @xmath5\\,=\\ , \\frac{1}{2}\\int[dg]^3 \\bar{\\varphi}(g_1,g_2,g_3)\\varphi(g_3,g_2,g_1 ) \\;- \\hspace{4 cm } \\nonumber \\\\ -\\;\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\int [ dg]^6 \\varphi(g_1,g_2,g_3)\\varphi(g_3,g_4,g_5)\\varphi(g_5,g_2,g_6)\\varphi(g_6,g_4,g_1 ) \\quad + \\quad c.c .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the basic variables is a ( complex ) field over @xmath6 , with @xmath7 a lie group ( @xmath8 for the 3d quantum gravity model ) , assumed to possess the invariance : @xmath9 , and the same combinatorics as the simple tensor model above .",
    "the invariance property is a simple example of additional feature imposed on a tensorial field , motivated , as the choice @xmath10 , by quantum geometric considerations @xcite .",
    "all the above models are then defined , at the quantum level , by the perturbative expansion of the partition function in feynman diagrams @xmath11 , which correspond to arbitrary gluings of d - simplices ( or other polytopes ) along their ( d-1)-faces .",
    "what physics one seeks to encode in the formalism depends on the exact choices of action ( interaction kernel and propagator ) and data associated to the basic tensorial field ( domain space ) .",
    "this area of research has witnessed an impressive growth in recent years , with results on many aspects of the formalism : the construction of models for quantum gravity as well as statistical systems , studies on classical and quantum symmetries of the same models , analyses on the topology of the cellular complexes generated in perturbative expansion , the large - n limit , studies on perturbative tgft renormalization , works on summability and critical behaviour , and the extraction of effective physics .",
    "for all this , we refer to the literature .",
    "now , we focus on the definition of quantum gravity models .",
    "the phase space underlying quantum gravity tgft models is the cotangent bundle over a lie group : @xmath12 , with , in particular , @xmath10 .",
    "this is the building block of the phase space of both simplicial gravity and lqg @xcite .",
    "the group elements are interpreted as parallel transports of an @xmath8 connection along elementary links of a graph or of a ( dual of a ) simplicial complex , and the conjugate lie algebra elements as fluxes of a dual ( densitized ) co - triad across ( d-2)-faces dual to the same links .",
    "we refer to the literature for more details on the quantization . here",
    "we report on some recent work @xcite on a new representation for the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the fundamental poisson brackets are @xmath13 where @xmath14 are coordinates on the group manifold and @xmath15 is a lie derivative .",
    "any choice of _ quantization map",
    "_ @xmath16 will give the corresponding algebra of operators acting on some hilbert space @xmath17 .",
    "given the commutativity of functions on the group , a standard basis is given by group - labelled states , which provide a realization of the hilbert space as @xmath18 .",
    "one can also look for a dual realization in terms of non - commutative functions of lie algebra elements @xmath19 , endowed with a @xmath20-product following uniquely from the quantization map : @xmath21 this allows to define the ( flux ) representation @xmath22 the coefficients of the change of basis from group - labelled states to lie algebra - labelled states are non - commutative plane waves : @xmath23 @xmath24 are the coordinates obtained by inverse exponential map , and the @xmath20-exponential is defined by the series expansion in @xmath20-monomials of lie algebra elements .",
    "the plane waves are thus generically @xmath20-exponentials for the @xmath20-product defined from the quantization map , and can be written as standard exponentials for some choice of coordinates on the group which also follows uniquely from the quantization map .",
    "they satisfy : @xmath25 . using them , one",
    "can then define a unitary intertwining map between group and lie algebra representations : a non - commutative fourier transform .",
    "the flux representations and non - commutative fourier transforms that follow from various quantization maps have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the one based on the plane waves @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , with @xmath28 in the fundamental representation ( @xmath29 are the pauli matrices ) , has already found several applications in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "we now give an example of a tgft model for 4d gravity @xcite .",
    "we aim at a description of quantum spacetime as the result of the interaction of fundamental building blocks represented by quantum tetrahedra , the quanta of our tgft field , and at encoding appropriately their quantum geometry .",
    "a geometric tetrahedron in @xmath30 can be described by four bivectors @xmath31 , associated to its four triangles , and a vector @xmath32 , interpreted as its ( unit ) normal , satisfying : @xmath33 so the classical phase space for a tetrahedron , before the imposition of constraints , is @xmath34 ^ 4\\simeq \\left[\\mathcal{t}^*su(2)\\times\\mathcal{t}^*su(2)\\right]^4 $ ] . in selfdual and anti - selfdual components",
    ", the first condition becomes @xmath35 , where @xmath36 maps the vector @xmath37 to @xmath38 , then @xmath39 .",
    "one can also change variables to @xmath40 so that @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "we define a tgft field representing a quantum tetrahedron @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( representing triangle bivectors ) . on this , we impose : @xmath46 upon integration over @xmath47 , this gives the closure condition ( this is a generalization of the invariance of the boulatov tgft field ) . then , we impose the simplicity condition using the function : @xmath48 } e^{i \\beta tr[u x^+]}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the @xmath50 non - commutative delta function , as : @xmath51 defining @xmath52 , the action for the tgft model imposing all the geometric conditions is @xmath53 ^ 4 \\,d k   \\ , \\varphi_{k1234 } \\star \\varphi_{k 1   2 3 4 } \\nonumber    % \\\\ % & & \\hspace{1 cm }    + \\frac{\\lambda}{5 ! }   \\int [ d^6 x_i][d k_a ]    \\ , \\widehat{\\psi}_{1234k_a } \\star \\widehat{\\psi}_{4567k_b}\\star   \\widehat{\\psi}_{7389k_c}\\star   \\widehat{\\psi}_{962\\,10k_d } \\star \\widehat{\\psi}_{10\\,851k_e } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the star product pairs repeated indices .",
    "the feynman amplitudes of this tgft take the form of a non - commutative simplicial path integral for the holst - plebanski action ( with immirzi parameter @xmath54 ) , and a quantum measure including geometric constraints on both bivectors and discrete connection .",
    "the expansion of the same amplitudes in group representations gives a spin foam model , encoding these constraints as conditions on the embedding of @xmath8 representations into @xmath55 representations .",
    "see also @xcite for more quantum gravity applications of the non - commutative flux representation .",
    "let us now summarize some motivations for enriching tensor models with pre - geometric data to give tgfts .",
    "the first reason is exemplified by the tgft presented above : due to the additional data , the feynman amplitudes of tgfts can be given by simplicial gravity path integrals and , dually , by spin foam models .",
    "thus , tgfts are a 2nd quantized formulation of the spin network dynamics of lqg and connect directly with other quantum gravity approaches . from them , they can import techniques and physical insights , which in turn can guide both tgft model building and the analysis of the resulting models .",
    "compared to tensor models , tgfts can be endowed with new symmetries , e.g. the analogue of 3d simplicial diffeomorphisms @xcite , possibly leading to different critical behaviour and phase structure .",
    "a true renormalization flow for tgfts can be defined and the issue of renormalizability addressed @xcite .",
    "last , the additional pre - geometric information is an important guide for reading outpossible geometric and physical meaning from the tgft field and action and states , using the insights coming from lqg , spin foam models and simplicial gravity .",
    "the possibility of such physically motivated guesses and approximations will be crucial in the analysis of any tgft model for gravity , and in any attempt to relate it to effective continuum physics ( e.g. via mean field methods @xcite ) .",

    "<S> the spin foam approach has developed to a great extent , with the construction of new models and an increased understanding of their quantum geometric aspects @xcite . to go beyond the truncation of degrees of freedom represented by any single simplicial complex , towards an approximately continuum physics , remains however a pressing issue . </S>",
    "<S> this is basically a problem in renormalization and of extracting effective dynamics from the fundamental one . </S>",

    "<S> this second strategy rests on the new developments of tensor models @xcite , in particular the discovery of a large - n expansion @xcite , which have led to improved analytic control . </S>",
