    "narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) objects are a class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) discovered by @xcite and identified by their optical properties : narrow permitted lines ( fwhm ( h@xmath2 ) @xmath3 2000 km s@xmath4 ) emitted from the broad line region , [ oiii]/h@xmath2 @xmath3 3 , and a bump due to feii ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they also exhibit high x - ray variability , steep x - ray spectra and a prominent soft x - ray excess .",
    "these characteristics point to systems with smaller masses of the central black hole ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 ) and higher accretion rates ( up to 90% of the eddington value ) with respect to blazars and radio galaxies .",
    "although nls1s usually do not show strong radio emission , a small fraction ( @xmath87% ) is radio - loud @xcite . at radio frequencies ,",
    "radio - loud nls1s usually display a relatively compact morphology without extended structures , and strong and variable emission with a flat spectrum , suggesting that relativistic jets may form in these systems .",
    "+ the discovery by _",
    "fermi_-lat of @xmath0-ray emission in the radio - loud nls1 pmnj0948 + 0022 @xcite provided a strong support to the presence of a closely aligned relativistic jet .",
    "vlbi observations of pmnj0948 + 0022 pointed out the presence of a bright and compact component with an inverted spectrum that dominates the radio emission , and a faint jet feature @xcite .",
    "the variable emission and the brightness temperature exceeding the equipartition brightness temperature indicates that the source must be relativistically beamed , with doppler factor @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to pmnj0948 + 0022 , variable @xmath0-ray emission was detected in other 4 nls1 objects , all radio loud : 1h0323 + 342 , pks1502 + 036 , pks2004@xmath1447 @xcite and more recently sbs0846 + 513 @xcite .",
    "the increasing number of @xmath0-ray detection of radio - loud nls1s suggests that they form a new class of gamma - ray emitting agns .",
    "this discovery poses intriguing questions about our knowledge of the blazar sequence , the development of relativistic jets , and the evolution of radio - loud agns .",
    "detailed studies of this new class of gamma - ray agns are fundamental for shedding light on the characteristics of these objects and the difference with respect to the other two agn populations , blazars and radio galaxies , emitting in the gamma - ray energy band .",

    "fermi_-lat @xcite .",
    "multi - epoch studies of the radio emission from the source indicate that the flux density has some degrees of variability ( i.e. a variation of 70% at 4.8 ghz during 1986 - 2009 ) .",
    "the resolution provided by the vla is not adequate to resolve the source structure ( fig .",
    "[ fmj - f1 ] ) .",
    "when imaged with the high spatial resolution provided by the vlba , the source shows two asymmetric components resembling a core - jet structure ( figs .",
    "[ fmj - f2 ] and [ fmj - f3 ] ) , as also pointed out in a previous work by @xcite .",
    "the flux density ratio between components e and w is about 19 and 14 at 5 ghz and 8.4 ghz , respectively .",
    "they are separated by about 3.5 mas ( @xmath823 pc at source redshift z=0.5835 ) .",
    "although the source is unresolved with the vla , pc - scale vlba observations can not recover all the vla flux density .",
    "such a discrepancy between the flux densities may be related to the intrinsic variability of the source . even when vla and vlba observations were performed simultaneously ( i.e. 1996 , january 6 ) , the vlba flux density was only 85% of the value measured with the vla at the same frequency .",
    "this suggests that the missing flux on parsec scale may be related to extended , low - brightness features , like a jet structure , that is resolved out by the vlba array . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "with its convex radio spectrum peaking above 5 ghz , pks1502 + 036 was selected by @xcite as part of the bright sample of high frequency peakers ( hfps ) . given",
    "the anticorrelation found between the intrinsic source size ( i.e. age ) and the spectral peak @xcite , hfp objects should represent radio sources in the very earliest stages of their radio evolution .",
    "however , by the analysis of their radio properties ( i.e. variability , morphology , polarization ) , it turned out that a great fraction ( @xmath860% ) of objects from the bright hfp sample are contaminant blazars rather than genuinely young radio sources @xcite . based on simultaneous multifrequency ( from 1.4 to 22 ghz ) vla observations carried out in several epochs , pks1502 + 036 turned out to possess strong spectral and flux density variability ( fig .",
    "[ fmj - f4 ] ) . during these epochs",
    "the spectral peak was at 7.6 , 7.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 8.8 ghz , respectively .",
    "variability is a typical property displayed by blazars , while young radio sources are non - variable objects .",
    "for this reason pks1502 + 036 was rejected from the hfp sample of young radio sources @xcite .",
    "+ pks1502 + 036 is unresolved on the typical vla scales ( fig .",
    "[ fmj - f5 ] ) . however , when imaged with the parsec scale resolution provided by vlba observations , its radio structure is marginally resolved and a second component seems to emerge from the core . in the vlba images at 15 ghz the double radio structure is clearly resolved suggesting a core - jet structure .",
    "the radio emission is dominated by the core component , while the jet - like feature is only 4% of the total flux density . comparing the 15-ghz observations carried out at two different epochs ( 11 january 2002 , and 21 july 2006 , figs .",
    "[ fmj - f6 ] and [ fmj - f7 ] ) it seems that in the second - epoch image there is a weak component of 4 mjy , separated by 3.05 mas ( @xmath816.5 pc at z=0.4088 ) from the core which was not detected in the previous observations , although the sensitivity between the two observations is similar .",
    "pks2004@xmath1447 is a powerful ( @xmath10 w / hz ) radio source at redshift z=0.24 and it is one of the four radio - loud nls1 detected in gamma rays during the first year of _ fermi _ operation @xcite .",
    "however its classification is still uncertain .",
    "@xcite classified pks2004@xmath1447 as a genuine radio - loud nls1 based on the optical definition . at radio wavelengths",
    "it is characterized by a steep ( @xmath11 @xmath12 0.5 , s(@xmath11 ) @xmath13 @xmath14 ) synchrotron spectrum at high frequency ( above 8.4 ghz ) and the absence of significant flux density variability . when imaged with arcsecond - resolution ( e.g. atca )",
    "it is unresolved .",
    "based on these characteristics @xcite proposed this source as a genuine compact symmetric object ( cso ) . on the other hand , pks2004@xmath1447 has been included in the crates catalog of flat spectrum objects @xcite due to its flatter spectrum ( @xmath150.3 ) below 4.8 ghz , questioning the nature of the radio emission .",
    "indeed a flat spectrum is usually an indication of a self - absorbed component as in the blazar population , where the emission is dominated by the core region enhanced by projection effects .",
    "however , a flat spectrum may also be an indication of a convex spectrum as those found in young radio objects , whose spectral peak occurs between the frequencies considered .",
    "+ so far the only information on the pc - scale structure of pks2004@xmath1447 is from archival vlba data at 1.4 ghz ( fig .",
    "[ fmj - f8 ] ) .",
    "the radio structure has an angular size of 45 mas ( 170 pc ) with a position angle of @xmath150@xmath16 , and it is resolved into 3 main components .",
    "the lack of the spectral index information does not allow us to unambiguously classify the sub - components .",
    "for example the compact component a can be either the core of a core - jet boosted blazar , or a bright hotspot of an asymmetric young radio source .",
    "relativistic jets are the most extreme manifestation of the power generated by a super massive black hole ( smbh ) in the center of an agn , with a large fraction of this power being emitted in the gamma - ray energy band .",
    "gamma - ray emission from radio - loud nls1s provides evidence that relativistic jets may be not a peculiarity of blazars and radio galaxies / quasars , both hosted in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "nls1s are generally hosted in spiral galaxies @xcite , and the presence of relativistic jets in these objects challenges the paradigm that the relativistic jets can form only in elliptical @xcite .",
    "however , only for one out of the five gamma - ray nls1s , 1h0323 + 342 , a high resolution hst observation suggests that this agn is hosted in a spiral galaxy @xcite .",
    "multi - band campaigns aimed at studying the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this possible new gamma - ray emitting population pointed out that their physical properties and jet power are similar to those found in blazars . in particular the jet power estimated for pmnj0948 + 0022 and pks1502 + 036 is in the region of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , while in the case of 1h0323 + 342 and pks2004@xmath1447 the jet power is in the range typical of bl lac objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "+ the blazar - like behaviour of these objects casts doubts questioning their nature and role in the context of the blazar sequence . considering the relative small black hole masses and the high accretion rates ,",
    "rl - nls1s allow us to extend the physical properties of relativistic objects to low - mass systems .",
    "however , models developed so far can fit the sed only from the ir to shorter wavelengths , leaving the low - energy part of their spectrum not fully understood .",
    "+ from the preliminary analysis of the radio data presented here , we found that all the sources are compact on kpc scales , but they are resolved on parsec scales .",
    "the radio emission of sbs0846 + 513 and pks1502 + 036 is dominated by a flat - spectrum compact and bright component from which a fainter jet - like feature emerges .",
    "both sources show substantial flux density variability .",
    "+ in the case of pks1502 + 036 , the availability of two - epoch vlba observations at 15 ghz allowed us to detect a new component at about 3 mas from the central region that was not visible in the first observing epoch .",
    "assuming that this component is the same knot of the jet detected at about 1 mas during the first epoch , we estimate an apparent superluminal expansion velocity of @xmath88c , providing further evidence for boosting effects . however , with only two observations taken with a time separation of 4 years , we can not unambiguously state that the two components are the same one at the different epochs . to confirm this result we are now analyzing additional archival vlba observations which allow a better time sampling .",
    "+ the interpretation of the radio properties of pks2004@xmath1447 is more uncertain due to the lack of spectral information .",
    "in fact , the bright and compact component at the easternmost edge of the source may be either the source core , or a very compact hot - spot like those found in a few young radio sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . the little flux density variability reported by @xcite , and",
    "its steep spectrum above 8.4 ghz make pks2004 - 447 a candidate of being a young radio source rather than a blazar . to unveil the nature of this source new multifrequency observations with parsec - scale resolution have been requested .",
    "+ although the radio properties are important to constrain the emission mechanisms in the low - energy part of the spectrum of rl - nls1s , at centimeter wavelengths , i.e. those discussed here , their emission is highly affected by synchrotron self - absorption . the one - zone homogeneous model adopted for the broad - band sed of these sources ( e.g. *",
    "* ) is based on a single synchrotron emission component which does not fit the radio data , being all the emission below 10@xmath17 hz considered self - absorbed .",
    "information on the mm / sub - mm emission is fundamental to set tight constraints on the low - energy emission , and alma observations will open a new window for investigating these sources in an unexplored frequency domain .",
    "+    the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the vla and the vlba are operated by the us national radio astronomy observatory which is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
