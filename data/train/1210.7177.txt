    "according to the latest baryon census in the local ( @xmath11 ) universe ( shull , smith & danforth , 2012 and references therein ) , about 30 - 40% of the total number of baryons predicted by big - bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. kirkman et al .",
    "2003 ) , inferred by density fluctuations of the cosmic microwawe background ( e.g. bennett et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , and seen at @xmath12 in the `` ly@xmath4 forest '' ( e.g. rauch , 1998 ; weinberg et al . 1997 ) , are missing at the present epoch .",
    "of the low-@xmath13 baryons we can account for in a recent census ( shull , smith & danforth , 2012 ) , @xmath14% lie in a collapsed phase ( stars , cold atomic and molecular gas in galaxies , circumgalactic medium - cgm - , and hot virialized gas in groups and clusters of galaxies ) , @xmath15% lie in the local photoionized ly@xmath4 forest , and finally , as much as @xmath16% , are estimated to be found in the ovi / bla - traced warm - hot intergalactic medium .",
    "the remaining @xmath17% of baryons still remains elusive , and are likely to lie in the hot phase of the whim , at temperatures larger than logt@xmath18 k.    this is predicted by nearly all hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of structures in a @xmath19-cdm universe ( e.g. cen & ostriker , 2006 , tornatore et al .",
    "2010 , bertone et al .",
    "2010 , branchini et al .",
    "2009 , smith et al . 2011 ) .",
    "according to simulations , starting at redshift of @xmath20 some of the igm was shock - heated to temperatures of @xmath21 k during the continued process of collapse and structure formation , and enriched up to z@xmath22 z@xmath23 by galaxy super - winds ( gsw , e.g. cen & ostriker , 2006 ) already at redshifts of @xmath24 , remaining essentially unchanged from then to @xmath3 .",
    "the first pieces of observational evidence of this violent process of structure formation are starting to be gathered in the densest nodes of this filamentary igm , at and inside the virial radius of massive clusters of galaxies ( e.g. keshet et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , diffuse whim filaments are too tenuous to be detected through their bremsstrahlung and line emission with current far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) or x - ray instruments ( e.g. yoshikawa et al .",
    "absorption is more promising .    the lowest temperature tail of the whim distribution , from t@xmath25 up to @xmath26 k ( where the fraction of ovi peaks ) , has been most likely detected in the fuv , with fuse and the stis spectrometer onboard the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) , in ovi and narrow ly@xmath4 absorbers , though the fraction of this gas that actually belongs to the shock - heated whim is highly uncertain ( e.g. danforth & shull , 2008 ) .",
    "more recently , the advent of the larger throughput cosmic origins spectrograph of _ hst _ ( cos , hereinafter ) has enabled the detection of somewhat hotter ( t@xmath27 ) and possibly truly shock - heated whim , through the detectability of the strongest ( i.e. large column density ) broad lyman @xmath4 absorbers ( blas ) with thermal doppler parameter @xmath28 km s@xmath29 ( danforth , stocke & shull , 2010 ) , which includes a combination of internal turbulence and hubble - flow broadening .",
    "danforth , stocke & shull , 2010 , estimate an average correction factor @xmath30 . ] .",
    "these blas are in principle good tracers of the warm ( t@xmath31 k ) portion of the whim , where a significant fraction of the whim ( @xmath32% , e.g. cen & ostriker , 2006 ) is supposed to reside",
    ". however , observing @xmath33 km s@xmath29 blas requires data of excellent quality and accurate continuum definition to detect the low - contrast features .",
    "in addition , measuring hi without an ionization correction will always underestimate the actual baryon fraction in the fraction of hot igm sampled by these tracers .",
    "given the temperature of this gas , such an ionization correction can only come from the x - ray detection of the highly ionized counterparts to such blas .",
    "finally , the t@xmath34 k portion of the whim ( the vast majority of the whim mass ) can only be detected through highly ionized metals in the x - rays .",
    "however , detecting the metal tracers of the bulk of the `` missing baryons '' in the `` x - ray forest '' , has proven to be extremely difficult .",
    "this is because of the unfortunate combination of ( a ) the still limited resolving power ( @xmath35 at the location of the ovii k@xmath4 transition , at @xmath36  ) and the low throughput ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) of the current high - resolution x - ray spectrometers [ the xmm-_newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs , den herder , et al .",
    "2001 ) and the _ chandra _ low energy transmission grating ( letg : brinkman et al . 2000 ) ] ; ( b ) the lack of bright ( @xmath39 erg s@xmath29 @xmath40 ) extragalactic point - like targets at sufficiently high redshifts ; and , ( c ) the dramatic steepening in slope ( @xmath41 ) of the predicted number density of metal he - like whim filaments per unit redshift at ion column densities @xmath42 @xmath40 ( e.g. cen & fang , 1996 ) .",
    "current evidence is still limited , and highly controversial .",
    "the statistically strongest evidence to date comes from the evidence for large amounts of baryonic matter in two intervening whim filaments along the line of sight to the nearby ( @xmath43 ) blazar mkn  421 ( nicastro et al .",
    "2005a , b ) .",
    "however , these results are controversial ( kaastra et al .",

    "2007 , danforth et al .",
    "2011 , yao et al . 2012",
    "; but see also williams et al .",
    "2006 , nicastro , mathur & elvis , 2008 , williams et al .",
    "2010 ) .    over the last few years",
    "there have been new discoveries reported ( buote et al .",
    "2009 : b09 ; fang et al . 2010 : f10 ; nicastro et al .",
    "2010 , zappacosta et al .",
    "2010 , zappacosta et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , such tentative discoveries are either serendipitous ( and so biased toward the strongest systems : nicastro et al .",
    "2010 ; zappacosta et al , 2012 ) , or trace extreme galaxy overdensity regions ( zappacosta et al . 2010 ) or even just galaxy halos ( buote et al . 2009 ; zappacosta et al .",
    "2010 ; williams et al .",
    "2012 ) . in all cases , these sample only the hottest and densest igm or circumgalactic medium , which is not representative of the majority of the whim .",
    "thus a firm , high - significance detection of the bulk of the missing baryon mass has not been secured yet .",
    "to do so , the only pursuable observational strategy , with current instrumentation , is to first identify `` true '' gaseous signposts ( e.g. mathur , weinberg & chen , 2003 ) of the t@xmath44 whim ( i.e. blas ) , and then search for their metal counterparts in the soft x - rays , along optimally selected sightlines . over the past two years we selected 1es  1553 + 113 as  the best whim target in the universe ( because of its extreme soft x - ray brightness , relatively high redshift and the presence of bla signposts in its _",

    ", we summarize our conclusions . in a forthcoming article ( `` paper ii '' )",
    ", we will present a self - consistent modeling of the spectral features detected in the letg spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 by making use of our whim hybrid collisional - ionization plus photoionization models , and so deriving preliminary estimates of metallicities of these systems , the ionization - corrected baryon cosmological mass density of the whim at t@xmath26 k , the number density of cv and ovii whim absorbers as a function of the ion column density .",
    "four years ago , we selected 1es  1553 + 113 as the optimal target for fuv and x - ray whim studies , because of its relatively high estimated redshift prior to spectroscopic determinations ( @xmath45 , from the non - detection of the host galaxy in a deep _ hst _ r ) and its extreme average 0.1 - 2.4 kev brightness of 2 mcrab ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath29 @xmath40 ) , coupled with a bright and stable fuv flux of @xmath47 erg s@xmath29 @xmath40 .",
    "1es  1553 + 113 was first observed with the _ hst_-cos on september 22 , 2009 , for 3 orbits ( 1 orbit with the g130 m and 2 with the g160 m grating : danforth et al .",
    "almost 2 years later , on july 24 , 2011 , the target was re - observed for 2 additional orbits with the g130 m and 4 additional oribits with the g160 m .",

    "we summarize the main findings from this 2009 observation , relevant to this work .",
    "the published _ hst_-cos spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 secured a robust lower limit on the spectroscopic redshift of 1es  1553 + 113 .",

    "2010 ) , so establishing a spectroscopic lower limit on the redshift of 1es  1553 + 113 of @xmath49 ( almost twice the non - spectroscopic value upon which we based our original selection ) and making this target by far the brightest , non - transient , x - ray source in the @xmath50 sky . moreover , danforth et al .",
    "( 2010 ) report on the presence of 5 possible blas , at @xmath51 , 0.10230 , 0.12325 , 0.13334 and 0.15234 , plus a rare and complex triple - hi - metal absorption system at @xmath52 , spanning a range of 1200 km s@xmath29 in velocity ( fig .",
    "2 , table 1 , in danforth et al .",
    "in our work , we use these systems as initial gaseous signposts for our x - ray search of either whim filaments ( bla counterparts ) , or highly ionized galaxy outflows and hot circumgalactic medium from nearby galaxies ( counterparts to the triple - hi - metal system ) . however , since the 2011 cos observation observation almost doubled the s / n of the first published spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 , we also retrieved and reduced the total final cos spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 , and present here a re - analysis of it whenever the higher s / n data detect fuv lines associated to the proposed x - ray identifications and that had eluded detections in the published spectrum because of its lower s / n .",
    "_ chandra _ observed 1es  1553 + 113 between may - june 2011 , for 500 ks , with the letg spectrometer ( constant resolution @xmath53 m , i.e. resolving power r@xmath54 at @xmath55  ) dispersed across the high resolution camera for spectroscopy ( hrc - s , murray et al .",
    "1985 ) plates .",
    "the observation consisted of three visits with exposures of 166.3 ks ( 2011 , may 4 - 6 ) , 175.4 ks ( 2011 , may 6 - 9 ) and 153.9 ks ( 2011 , june 18 - 20 ) .",
    "the data were reduced with the latest version of the chandra interactive analysis of observation software ( ciao v. 4.4.1 , caldb v. 4.5.2 ) , following the standard processing procedures outlined in the hrc - s - letg grating analysis thread .",
    "the _ chandra _ hrc - s detector has virtually no spectral resolution , which prevents the separation of the different spectral orders dispersed by the letg . for each observation",
    ", we therefore extracted `` all - order '' negative and positive source and background spectra with the ciao tool _ tg_extract_. this produced a total of six letg spectra , three ( one per letg visit ) negative - order and three positive - order source and background spectra , extracted at a binning pace of @xmath56 m , i.e. oversampling the letg fwhm resolution of 50 m  by a factor of 4 .",
    "due to the impossibility of separating hrc - letg spectral orders , the spectral modeling of these spectra must be performed by folding the fitting models with the sum of the convolution products of the redistribution matrices ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) belonging to the first n positive and negative orders , respectively . for our letg observations of 1es  1553 + 113",
    ", we conservatively decided to build our final `` all - order '' response matrix by adding up positive and negative orders up to n = 10 . for each order",
    ", we used the ciao tools _ mkgarf _ and _ mkgrmf _ to build 20 effective area and photon - redistribution matrices , which were then read together with the data into the ciao fitting - package _ sherpa _ , through the commands _ load_multi_arfs _ and _",
    "load_multi_rmfs_.    to maximize the s / n of our spectra ( we note that the hrc - s - letg combination has an effective area of only a@xmath57 @xmath38 at both @xmath58 and 44  ) , we first co - added the three negative and three positive - order spectra ( source and background ) from the three observations ( ciao tool _ add_grating_spectra _ ) , to produce 2 letg spectra ( one negative- and one positive - order spectrum ) , with net exposures of 495.6 ks each .",
    "effective area matrices of the three observations , for each of the 10 negative and ten positive orders , were averaged together , producing 20 averaged effective area matrices ( arfs ) .",
    "finally , we used the ciao tool _ add_grating_orders _ to co - add the two negative and positive order source and background spectra and arfs , to end up with a single letg spectrum , containing all counts from the ten negative - order and the ten positive - order spectra of the three _ chandra _ observations of 1es  1553 + 113 . the final co - added spectrum , has roughly 250 - 300 net ( i.e. background subtracted ) counts per @xmath59 m , resolution element , over the two interesting spectral bands covering the @xmath60 ovii k@xmath4 ( @xmath61  ) and cv k@xmath4 ( @xmath62  ) ranges at redshifts where whim absorption might be found , for a signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element ( s / n)@xmath63 .",
    "because of our co - adding procedure , particular care must be taken to account for the wavelength calibration inaccuracy .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "letg - hrc - s spectrometer suffers a variable intrinsic wavelength uncertainty owing to the non - linearity in the effective dispersion relation .",
    "this non - linearity is due to a spatial imaging non - linearity of the hrc - s detector caused by the combination of ( 1 ) partial charge loss in the 3-tap read - out algorithm of each of the three hrc - s microchannel plates , each of which is divided into 190 taps along the dispersion direction , and ( 2 ) a hardware problem that corrupts the data from the position taps under a specific set of conditions .",
    "the net result is that photon event positions obtained from processing hrc - s telemetry can be offset from their true values .",
    "the wavelength errors thus depend on the physical location of dispersed photon events on the hrc - s , and so on both precise nominal pointing direction and the deliberate lissajous figure `` dither '' about this point .",
    "an updated version of the degap polynomial coefficients based on empirical wavelength corrections from multiple hrc - s / letg observations of capella has been released since caldb 3.2.15 .",
    "this update allows the correction of the non - linearities in the hrc - s dispersion relation improving the 90% statistical significance uncertainties across the detector ( i.e. @xmath64 ) from 22 m  to 16 m .",
    "since we have co - added three different observations , and then the resulting positive and negative orders , we should consider a larger uncertainty . by propagating four times , in quadrature , the quoted deviations , we obtain 90% uncertainties of 32 m .",
    "however , since the updated wavelength corrections have been applied to the rest - frame position of the strongest soft x - ray metal electronic transitions and the interpolation of the correction may not be strictly valid to the position of blueshifted and redshifted lines , we conservatively adopt a 90% wavalength uncertainty 40 m , 80% of the letg line spread function ( lsf ) fwhm .    in the following",
    "we report all uncertainties at the 1@xmath1 ( 68% ) statistical significance level , with the exception of x - ray wavelength and redshifts , for which we use 90% statistical confidences ( i.e. 1.6@xmath1 ) .",
    "we used the fitting package _ sherpa _",
    ", in ciao , to fit our _ chandra_-letg spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 .",
    "we ignored data outside the @xmath65   spectral interval , where the ( s / n ) was either too low ( @xmath66   and @xmath67  ) and/or the spectral resolving power too low ( at @xmath68  , r@xmath69 , implying @xmath70 km s@xmath29 ) .",
    "we first fitted the spectrum with a model consisting of a single power law absorbed by neutral gas .",
    "this yielded a best - fitting power - law energy spectral index and cold - absorber column density of @xmath71 and n@xmath72 @xmath40 ( fully consistent with the galactic value along the line of sight to 1es  1553 + 113 : n@xmath73 @xmath40 ( kalberla et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the integrated reduced @xmath74 was acceptable , @xmath75 .",
    "however , a visual inspection of the residuals showed both broad deviations around the k instrumental edges of oi ( @xmath76  ) and ci ( @xmath77  ) , the m edges of i and cs ( @xmath78  ) and the hrc - s plate gaps ( @xmath79  ) , as well as narrow deficit of counts at specific wavalengths .",
    "figure 1 , top panel , shows these residuals smoothed through a convolution with the letg lsf , in re - normalized ( after smoothing ) standard deviations .    at first",
    ", we excluded the possible absorption lines ( which do not affect the continuum fitting over the integrated 10 - 60   band ) and focused on curing the residual calibration uncertainties around the positions of the instrumental i , cs , o and c edges and the hrc - s plate gaps , with the aim of reaching an optimal model of the continuum that would allow us to properly assess the statistical significance of true physical spectral features possibly present in the spectrum .",
    "we then added to the continuum model , ( a ) an edge with negative optical depth , to cure the sharp edge - like emission feature present in the residuals at @xmath80   and due to either an over - estimated modeling of the ci instrumental edge in the letg effective area , or a non - accurate modeling of the ci absorption edge in the _ wabs _ model of xspec , or both ( best - fit @xmath81 ) ; ( b ) three broad emission gaussians at @xmath82  , @xmath83   and @xmath84   ( best - fitting @xmath85   for the first two and @xmath86   for the third ) to model residuals broad wiggles at the wavelength of the ci edge , and the dithering - shaped hrc - s plate gaps ; ( c ) five _ notch _ xspec component models : 4 negative ( at @xmath87 , @xmath88 , 48.34 and 52.14  , with total widths of 0.6 , 0.4 , 0.2 and 1.1 a , respectively ) , to model residual narrower ( but still well resolved ) deviations at the i and cs m edges and the c k edge and plate - gaps wavlengths fig .",

    "we re - fitted the data , and obtained an improvement of @xmath90 , for 20 additional degrees of freedom , with almost unchanged best - fitting parameters : @xmath91 and n@xmath92 @xmath40 .",
    "we measure a ( 0.1 - 2 ) kev flux of f@xmath93 erg s@xmath29 @xmath40 ( 1.2 mcrab ) .",
    "the lsf - smoothed residuals now appear flat over the entire 10 - 60   band ( fig .",
    "1 , bottom panel ) .      a visual inspection of the lsf - smoothed residuals in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom panel ) , shows clear narrow ( i.e. unresolved : @xmath94  ) deficit of counts involving 3 - 6 consecutive bins , especially in the spectral region where redshifted c absorption is expected .",
    "this is expected : indeed , the sensitivity of dispersed spectrometers with constant @xmath95 and s / n per resolution element , over a given band - pass , to a given ion column density , increases with wavelengths .",
    "this is because of the concurrence of two independent facts .",
    "first , the absorption line equivalent width ( ew ) sensitivity of a dispersed spectrum with given constant @xmath95 and s / n , down to a statistical significance n@xmath1 , can be written : @xmath96 .",
    "\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] second , the absorption line ew is related to the column density of the ion imprinting the line in the spectrum through the rest - frame position of the line and the redshift of the absorber . for unsaturated lines we can write : @xmath97 with @xmath98 in   and where @xmath99 is the column density of the ion @xmath100 of the element @xmath101 in @xmath40 , @xmath102 is the oscillator strength of the given transition of the ion @xmath103 , @xmath104 the rest - frame wavelength ( in  ) of the given transition of the ion @xmath103 , and @xmath13 the redshift of the absorber .",
    "therefore , from equations [ eq1 ] and [ eq2 ] : @xmath105 let us now consider , the letg spectrometer and , for example , the strongest k@xmath4 transitions of the two stable and most abundant ions of carbon and oxygen at t@xmath106 k , i.e. cv and ovii .",
    "the rest frame wavelengths of these two transitions are in a 1:2 ratio , and fall in regions of the spectrometer with similar effective area ( i.e. similar s / n in the same spectrum ) .",
    "therefore , from eq . [ eq3 ] , one gets @xmath107 \\simeq [ \\lambda(cv k\\alpha ) / \\lambda(ovii k\\alpha ) ] ^{-2 } \\simeq 1/4.\\ ] ] for a broad range of whim temperatures , logt@xmath108 , the fraction of cv and ovii are similar and between 0.7 - 1 . at @xmath109",
    "logt @xmath110 cv largely dominates over ovii .",
    "moreover , in gas with solar - like composition , oxygen is roughly twice more abundant than carbon .",
    "so , for @xmath109 logt @xmath111 the minimum detectable cv column density is at least twice smaller than the minimum detectable ovii column density .      to identify candidate unresolved absorption lines we wrote a routine that scans the lsf - smoothed residuals ( fig",
    "1 , bottom panel ) over @xmath112 m  wide contiguous bins ( 2.5 letg resolution elements ) , to search for negative deficits of counts involving between 3 - 7 consecutive bins ( i.e. 0.75 - 1.75 letg lsf fwhm at our oversampled resolution ) , and line - shaped , i.e. symmetrically distributed around a central negative peak ( at least one left and one right bin with values higher than the peak ) . we do not consider resolved lines here ( i.e. consecutive deficits of counts spreading over more than @xmath113 bins ) , since we assume that any ism or igm absorption lines must have intrinisc fwhm @xmath114 km s@xmath29 . by definition , lsf - smoothing of the residuals tends to smooth flickering in adjacent sub - resolution bins .",
    "thus , on the one hand it highlights real absorption ( or emission ) lines , but on the other hand it also increases the number of false absorption ( or emission ) line - like features with typical lsf width ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "1 bottom panel ) .",
    "we can estimate the expected number of lsf - shaped emission or absorption features exceeding a bin - by - bin integrated ( in quadrature ) significance of 3@xmath1 , by using a simple gaussian argument . at our 4@xmath115 lsf over - sampled binning",
    ", we have a total of ( 60 - 10)/0.0125 = 4000 bins .",
    "therefore the gaussian - predicted number of positive or negative lsf - shaped fluctuations at @xmath116 is ( 1 - 0.997)@xmath117 = 12 .",
    "so , on average , we expect a total of 6 emission and 6 absorption lsf - shaped fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the blind run of the scanning routine over the 10 - 60   lsf - smoothed residuals ( over - sampled at a resolution of 0.25@xmath115 the letg lsf fwhm ) , finds exactly 6 lsf - shaped emission features exceeding the bin - by - bin integrated ( in quadrature ) statistical significance of @xmath118 , according to expectations given the blazar nature of the target and the consequent absence of intrinsic emission in the optical or infrared spectra of 1es  1553 + 113 .",
    "on the contrary , 50 of such features are found in absorption , clearly suggesting that real absorption lines are imprinted on the 10 - 60   letg continuum spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 .",
    "given the way the scanning routine works , moving on contiguous 2.5 letg - lsf wide bins , some of the 50 absorption line candidates found by the routine are simply the same strong feature , detected twice over adjacent scanned bins .",
    "this leaves about 40 absorption - line candidates , still many more than predicted by gaussian statistics and found in emission .    to confirm the real absorption - line nature of these candidates ( at least down to the sensitivity of the current letg spectrum ) , we therefore used unresolved ( line fwhm frozen at 5 m ) absorption gaussians to model the non - smoothed data .",
    "we added these gaussians one by one and refitted the data , by allowing the line position to vary within 0.5   around the scan - routine determined position of the centroid .",
    "this procedure yielded the results summarized in table 1 , columns 1 and 2 .",
    "only 12 of the possible @xmath119 absorption candidates were actually confirmed by the fitting procedure at @xmath120% ( @xmath64 ) statistical significance .",
    "the single - line ( prior to secure identification ) statistical significances of 11 of these lines ( computed as the ratio between the best - fitting line normalization and its 1@xmath1 uncertainty ) are in the range @xmath121 : three lines at @xmath122 , three at @xmath123 , five at @xmath124 .",
    "( table 1 , column 2 and fig . 1 bottom panel ) . an additional line - like feature",
    "is only hinted by the data and can be fitted with a negative gaussian with single - line statistical significance of 1.7@xmath1 . in the following",
    "we consider the six lines with prior - to - identification statistical significance @xmath125 ( 0.04 and 0.08 expected by chance up to @xmath126 in the oxygen and carbon bands , respectively ; see  4.2 ) as real absorption lines , which need to be identified .",
    "the remaining six absorption features are considered as tentative detections that need confirmation , and we consider them here only in association with either higher significance letg absorbers or cos signposts , or both . in figure 2",

    "8 , top panel , red bins ) of the interesting , likely multi - phase , triple - hi - metal system detected in cos , possibly witnessing the on - going interplay between nearby galaxy outflows and a whim filament at @xmath310 , where a cv - ov - bla system is present .",
    "finally , the marginal detection at @xmath312   ( @xmath313 ) can only be redshifted ov or higher .",
    "the ov k@xmath4 transition would be redshifted to @xmath314 .",
    "there is a nla present in cos at @xmath315 , i.e. marginally consistent with the x - ray redshift .",
    "however , in photoionized gas ov shows fractional abundances similar to ovi .",
    "no ovi absorption is seen at this redshift either in the fuse spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 or in its letg spectrum .",
    "the ovi k@xmath4 transition would be redshifted to @xmath316 .",
    "no hi ly@xmath4 or ovi@xmath216 is seen at a consistent redshifts in cos or fuse . finally , the ovii and oviii k@xmath4 transitions , would be redshifted to @xmath317 and @xmath318",
    ". these two redshifts are both consistent with either the broadest ( @xmath319 km s@xmath29 , corresponding to logt@xmath320 k ) and strongest ( ew(bla ) = @xmath321 m ) bla detected in the published cos spectrum , at @xmath322 , or the redshift range of the unusual triple - hi - metal system at @xmath323 , respectively . however , while a possible double - cv counterpart to the triple - hi - metal system seen in cos is possibly detected in the letg (  4.1.5 ) , no ovii counterpart is detected .",
    "so , it appears unlikely that the line at @xmath312   is oviii associated with the triple - hi - metal system .    for this marginal letg detection",
    "we therefore favor the @xmath324 ovii - bla association ( table 1 , columns 3 - 5 ; fig",
    ". 1 magenta line ) , and tentatively identify this association with an intervening whim system at the cos - detected bla signpost ( though an oviii - triple - hi association can not be ruled out ) .",
    "no other associated x - ray line is hinted in the data ( fig .",
    "we stress that this is the weakest system for which we propose an identification in association with a cos system ( only one letg line , at @xmath313 ) .",
    "however , given the nature of this association ( ovii - bla ) , in principle probing the majority of the baryons in the whim , a confirmation of this putative ovii k@xmath4 detection at high statistical significance is highly desirable .",
    "the statistiscal significances of the x - ray absorption lines reported in table 1 ( second column ) , are single - line statistical significances .",
    "that is the ratio between the line flux , and its 1@xmath1 lower - bound uncertainty . for those lines not identifiable with @xmath325 transitions imprinted by galactic or circumgalactic gas",
    ", these significances over - estimate the true absorption - line statistical significances , because they derive from a number of redshift trials .",
    "this number of redshift trials , depends on the wavelength of the transition , the spectrometer resolution , and the available path length over which the blind search is performed : n@xmath326 , where @xmath327 is the rest frame wavelength of the given transition , and @xmath328 the spectrometer lsf fwhm . in our case , @xmath329 and @xmath330 m .",
    "so , the number of independent letg resolution elements is 173 for the ovii k@xmath4 and 322 for the cv k@xmath4 . in such conditions ,",
    "the true statistical significance ( i.e. after correcting for the unknown line position ) of a line blindly detected at a `` single - line '' statistical significance of 4@xmath1 is only 2.6@xmath1 and 2.4@xmath1 , for ovii k@xmath4 and cv k@xmath4 respectively .",
    "however , if an independent ( and physically self - consistent ) redshift prior is known ( ovi or bla in cos ) , then the line identification can be considered `` secure '' and therefore the single - line statistical significance provides a reliable estimate of the true statistical significance of the line .",
    "this is true for five out of the eight intervening lines : ( a ) the highest statistical significance @xmath5 cv and cvi lines , at redshift consistent with that of a strong bla - ovi system with the right temperature to produce cv , ( b ) the @xmath6 cv line , at redshift consistent with that of a shallow bla complex with the right temperature to produce cv ; ( c ) the putative @xmath309 cv - ov lines , at redshifts consistent with that of a bla at @xmath157 in cos , and ( d ) the speculative @xmath324 ovii absorber , at redshift consistent with that of a strong bla whose thermal width is appropriate for the production of ovii .",
    "the remaining three lines are identified as cv k@xmath4 at @xmath308 ( close to the lower boundary of a rare triple hi - metal system detected in cos ) , and cv - cvi k@xmath4 at @xmath7 , a redshift consistent with that of a bla whose column density , however , is probably too low to produce the entire cv and cvi absorption ( given the relatively low temperature derived for this bla ) . for the putative cv k@xmath4 line at @xmath295 ,",
    "its single - line significance is 3.6@xmath1 , which corresponds to a probability of chance detection of 3.5@xmath331 . allowing for the number of redshift trials , the probability of chance detection of this line rises to 0.056 , a gaussian - equivalent significance of 1.9@xmath1 .",
    "fo the cv - cvi system at @xmath7 , the presence of two lines poses a bound on the number of redshift trials for the line detected at lower statistical significance and makes its measured single - line statistical significances close to the true statistical significances .",
    "these two lines are detected at single - line significances of 3.8@xmath1 and @xmath243 , corresponding to probabilities of chance detections of 1.5@xmath331 and @xmath332 , respectively . allowing for the number of redshift trials , the probability of chance detection of the strongest of these two lines rises to 0.024 , a gaussian - equivalent significance of 2.3@xmath1 .",
    "however , considering this as a prior for the second line , the probability of having by chance both lines ( independently ) is the product of the two probabilities : p@xmath333 , corresponding to a gaussian - equivalent significance of 3.8@xmath1 .",
    "we report on the detection of six absorption lines and five additional features associated with either other x - ray lines detected at higher significance and/or far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) signposts , in the 500 ks _",
    "chandra_-letg spectrum of the bright ( f@xmath334 mcrab ) and distant ( @xmath335 ) blazar 1es  1553 + 113 .",
    "the six detections have single - line statistical significances between @xmath336 , while the five additional associations are detected with single - line statistical significances of 2.2 - 2.8@xmath1 .",
    "we tentatively identify these absorption lines as belonging to six different systems : the galaxy cold ism , and five intervening warm - hot igm filaments .",
    "three out of the five intervening absorption systems show multiple - ion associations in the x - rays , have bla ( and ovi for the system at @xmath5 ) counterparts at consistent redshifts in the _ hst _ cos spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 and have true x - ray statistical significances of @xmath8 ( @xmath5 ; 6.3@xmath1 if the low - significance ov and cv k@xmath9 associations are considered ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath6 ) and 3.8@xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "for these three systems , the cos counterparts are also physically consistent with the ionization degree and temperature of the x - ray absorbers in a shock - heated gas scenario . however , for the @xmath7 system , given the temperature implied by the bla width , the hi column density is probably too low to produce all the detected cv and cvi absorption .",
    "the two remaining proposed identifications are x - ray single - ion tentative detections ( with the exception of the cv - bla - ovi @xmath309 system , where ov may also be present ) , both with a possible , physically consistent , cos counterpart : ( b ) the double cv k@xmath4 system at @xmath337 ( 3.6@xmath1 ) and @xmath309 ( 2.2@xmath1 , plus ov k@xmath4 , 1.7@xmath1 ) , both with hi ( bla - ovi for the putative cv - ov at @xmath338 ) counterparts , and ( c ) the possible ovii k@xmath4 absorber at @xmath324 ( 2.3@xmath1 ) with a bla counterpart .    here",
    "we summarize our identifications :    * galactic ism : we detect atomic oi ( and possibly an excess of ism oxygen in compound forms , over the instrumental molecular oi ) , as well as cii at @xmath188 and associate these absorbers with the cold ism of our galaxy along the line of sight to 1es  1553 + 113 . *",
    "intervening system i : this is the highest significance letg system , with two lines detected at single - line statistical significances of 4.1@xmath1 each .",
    "we identify these two lines with cv and cvi absorption at @xmath339 , possibly imprinted by an intervening whim filament , as further suggested by our a - posteriori discovery of an associated strong bla and ovi counterpart in the cos spectrum , with the right temperature ( i.e. line doppler parameters ) and strength .",
    "associated ov and cv k@xmath9 absoprtion are also possibly hinted by the x - ray data .",
    "the combined ( in quadrature ) statistical significance of this system in the letg ( cv and cv k@xmath4 lines only)is 5.8@xmath1 .",
    "if the association with ov k@xmath4 and cvi k@xmath9 is considered , the statistical significance of the system is 6.3@xmath1 ) . *",
    "intervening system ii : we identify cv absorption at @xmath165 , consistent with the redshift of a structured bla complex that we discovered a posteriori in the currently avaiable cos spectrum of 1es  1553 + 113 .",
    "given the presence of a physically self - consistent redshift prior ( the bla complex in cos ) , the true statistical significance of this line in the letg is of 3.9@xmath1 . *",
    "intervening system iii : we identify a cv - cvi - bla system at @xmath275 , and associate this absorber with an intervening warm whim filament , where only part of the x - ray absorption is physically related to the detected bla .",
    "the statistical significance of this system in the letg ( after properly accounting for the number of redshift trials ) is 3.8@xmath1 . *",
    "tentative intervening system iv : we identify 2 cv k@xmath4 absorbers at redshifts @xmath295 and @xmath166 , where also ov k@xmath4 is tentatively detected , adjacent to the redshifts of the extremes of a narrow redshift interval containing a rare triple - hi - metal absorption system .",
    "one of these three hi absorber is a bla - ovi pair , with redshift and temperature fully consistent with that of the cv - ov absorber at @xmath166 .",
    "we speculate that the x - ray cv - ov absorbers trace the same multi - phase medium traced by the triple - hi - metal system in cos , possibly representing the result of the interplay between galaxy winds and a whim filament at @xmath166 . the cv line at @xmath295 is detected at single - line statistical significance of 3.6@xmath1 ( a true statistical significance of only 1.9@xmath1 , after allowing for the number of redshift trials ) , while the cv - bla - ovi system at @xmath166 is detected at a true significane of and 2.2@xmath1 ( 2.8@xmath1 if the ov k@xmath4 association is considered ) .",
    "* tentative intervening system v : we tentatively identify an ovii - bla system at @xmath340 and associate this absorber with an intervening hot whim filament .",
    "this is the weakest system for which we report a possible identification , with only one x - ray line at a single - line statistical significance of 2.3@xmath1 , but with a possible redshift prior identified in the broadest and strongest bla reported in the published cos spectrum .",
    "this moderate quality 500 ks _ chandra_-letg spectrum of the , by far , brightest steady soft x - ray target in the @xmath341 sky , strongly hints at the existence of possible x - ray metal whim counterparts to genuine gaseous signposts , previously secured with the _ hst_-cos ( or viceversa ) , and so demonstrates the efficiency of this observational strategy and the power of the x - ray - fuv synergy for whim studies .",
    "moreover , these results suggest that the gas may be often found to be multiphase , possibly indicating that the igm structure is richer than typically found in hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "longer integrations with both the high resolution soft x - ray spectrometers available ( the _ chandra_-letg and the xmm-_newton_-rgss ) are needed to confirm at high statistical significances and with two indipendent measurements these tentative identifications and associations ( especially for the three lowest statistical - significance associations ) , and to conduct a sensitive exploration of even hotter whim systems along this line of sight .",
