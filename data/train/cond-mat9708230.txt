    "<S> using the numerical diagonalization method , we investigate the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model , simulating a cu - o linear chain with strong coulomb repulsions . paying attention to the effect of the transfer energy @xmath2 between the nearest neighbor oxygen - sites , we calculate the critical exponent of correlation functions @xmath3 based on the luttinger liquid relations and the ground state energy @xmath4 as a function of an external flux @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transfer @xmath2 increases the charge susceptibility and the exponent @xmath3 in cooperation with the repulsion @xmath6 at cu - site . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that anomalous flux quantization occurs for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting region is presented on a phase diagram of @xmath6 vs. @xmath2 plane .    </S>",
    "<S> low - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems attract much interest due to the possible relevance to high-@xmath8 superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> a considerable number of theoretical studies have been performed on the strongly correlated fermion models either in one - band or multi - band version to understand the mechanism of the high temperature superconductivity . however , there is no consensus on what the actual mechanism of the superconductivity is , except for the fact that the strong repulsive interaction on cu - site plays an important role in the mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to achieve a solid understanding of this problem , some rigorous studies , even of the simplest models , are highly desirable at this stage . for such purpose </S>",
    "<S> , numerical diagonalization studies of finite size systems may be successful.@xcite in particular , one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model , simulating a cu - o linear chain with strong coulomb repulsions , provides a good target to investigate the mechanism of the high-@xmath8 superconductivity.@xcite the model contains hopping @xmath9 between cu(@xmath0)-site and oxygen(@xmath1)-site and repulsive interaction at the @xmath0- and @xmath1-site ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it can contain the nearest - neighbor @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction @xmath12 and/or hopping @xmath2 between the nearest - neighbor @xmath1-sites .    in the previous work,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the present authors have studied the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model with large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath10 at cu - sites and inter - site repulsion @xmath12 , by using the numerical diagonalization method . with the help of the luttinger liquid relations , </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting(sc ) correlation is found to be dominant compared with the cdw and sdw correlations in the proximity of the phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> the sc phase appears for @xmath13 almost independent of the filling with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> near the half - filling @xmath15 and the full - filling @xmath16 , however , the sc correlation is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite recently , sudb@xmath17 et al </S>",
    "<S> . showed that the @xmath0-@xmath1 chain with large @xmath12 exhibits flux quantization with charge @xmath18 and slow algebraic decay of the singlet sc correlation function on oxygen sites.@xcite other studies of the @xmath0-@xmath1 chain also showed that @xmath12 enhances the charge fluctuation as well as the sc fluctuations and when it exceeds a certain critical value the system becomes unstable towards phase separation.@xcite all of these studies claimed that the parameter @xmath12 is central in inducing a sc state at @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , if one adds the hopping term @xmath2 to the model , the situation will be changed completely . </S>",
    "<S> it enhances the charge fluctuation and increases the exponent @xmath3 as the parameter @xmath12 does . </S>",
    "<S> therefor , the repulsive interaction @xmath12 is not always necessary for the sc state . in the present paper , to clarify the effect of @xmath2 , we study the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the hopping @xmath2 by the numerical diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the critical exponent of correlation functions @xmath3 and the ground state energy @xmath4 as a function of an external flux @xmath5 . using the results for the critical exponent , we show a sc region on the @xmath20 plane .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following model hamiltonian for the cu - o chain :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand for creation operators of a hole with spin @xmath24 in the cu@xmath25-orbital at site @xmath26 and of a hole with spin @xmath24 in the o@xmath27-orbital at site @xmath28 respectively , and @xmath29 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath9 stands for the transfer energy between the nearest neighbor @xmath0- and @xmath1-sites , which will be set to be unity ( @xmath9=1 ) hereafter in the present study . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic energy levels of @xmath0- and @xmath1-orbitals are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the charge - transfer energy @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 .    to achieve systematic calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we use the periodic boundary condition for @xmath34 and antiperiodic boundary condition for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total hole number and m is an integer . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of the boundary condition removes accidental degeneracy so that the ground state might always be a singlet with zero momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the filling @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total number of unit cells ( each unit cell contains a @xmath0- and a @xmath1-orbitals ) and the fermi wave number @xmath40 is given as @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> we numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian up to 12 sites ( 6unit cells ) using the standard lanczos algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total ground state energy of a system with @xmath39 unit cells and @xmath36 holes . </S>",
    "<S> when the charge gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , the uniform charge susceptibility @xmath45 is obtained from @xmath46    in the luttinger liquid theory , some relations have been established as universal relations in the one - dimensional models.@xcite in the model which is isotropic in spin space , the critical exponents of various types of correlation functions are determined by a single parameter @xmath47 , which is the exponent of the power - law decay of correlation functions . for the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model in the weak coupling regime , </S>",
    "<S> matsunami and kimura @xcite calculated the critical exponents of some correlation functions by using the renormalization group analysis ( @xmath48-ology ) , and shown that the system belongs to the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid . in the present authors recent work,@xcite we have shown the numerical results of the critical exponent @xmath47 and the phase diagram on the @xmath10-@xmath12 plane including the weak coupling region and the strong coupling region . in the weak coupling region , it agrees with the results of the @xmath48-ology . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of spin - gap indicates that the strong coupling region also belongs to the tl regime and not to the luther - emery ( le ) regime . here </S>",
    "<S> , the le regime is characterized by a gap of the spin excitation spectrum , while in the tl regime , the excitation is gapless . @xcite    it is predicted that sc correlation is dominant for @xmath7 ( the correlation function decays as @xmath49 in the tl regime and as @xmath50 in the le regime ) , whereas charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) correlations is dominant for @xmath51 ( correlation functions decay as @xmath52 in the tl regime and as @xmath53 in the le regime ) . in the tl regime , the singlet sc and triplet sc correlation functions have the same critical exponent apart from a logarithmic correction . on the other hand , in the le regime , the correlation functions of sdw and triplet sc decrease exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath3 is related to the charge susceptibility @xmath45 and the charge velocity @xmath54 by the relations , @xcite @xmath55 with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the lowest charge excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> we can also determine the @xmath3 by the drude weight @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the total energy of the ground state as a function of flux @xmath5.@xcite using these two independent equations of the @xmath3 , we will check the consistency of the luttinger liquid relations .    for a non - interacting system ( @xmath62 ) , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is easily diagonalized and a dispersion relation is given as    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is a wave vector and @xmath65 represents a upper ( lower ) band energy . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the case with @xmath66 , the width of the lower band @xmath67 becomes narrower for @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> note that it decreases with @xmath32 and becomes perfectly flat at @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> when one decreases @xmath32 further , the band bends with a peak at @xmath70 . to investigate the band structure of interacting systems , we consider the chemical potential @xmath71 , which is corresponding to fermi energy @xmath72 at @xmath19 . figure [ fig:1](a ) shows @xmath71 as a function of the filling @xmath37 for several values of @xmath10 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the value of @xmath71 by using eq.(2 ) at the hole densities @xmath75 and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> data points with @xmath62 seem to sit closely along on the dispersion curve of @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that the finite - size effect is sufficiently small .    when @xmath10 is large , @xmath71 is large and weekly depends on @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the slope of @xmath71 becomes almost flat at @xmath78 . in this case , the charge susceptibility @xmath45 almost diverges , because of the relation , @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the result suggests that the width of effective hole band becomes very narrow due to a strong correlation effect of large repulsion @xmath10 . in order to see the behavior of the charge susceptibility more qualitatively , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) , we show the inverse of the charge susceptibility @xmath80 as a function of @xmath10 in a system with 6 unit cells for @xmath73 . in the case of @xmath66 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath80 is week and @xmath80 remains as a finite value . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is close to zero at @xmath81 for @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the transfer @xmath2 increases the charge susceptibility in cooperation with the repulsion @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> if we use the hartree - fock(h.f . ) </S>",
    "<S> approximation , the atomic levels of @xmath0-orbitals @xmath30 are pushed up as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the mean value of hole density @xmath84 at a @xmath0-site and determined by solving the self - consistent equation of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the band structure is approximately described as a renormalized band @xmath85 whose @xmath32 is replaced by @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the band width of @xmath87 decreases as @xmath88 decreases and becomes zero at sufficiently large @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the decreases of the band width leads to the enhancement of @xmath45 as shown in fig.1(b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we show the critical exponent of correlation functions @xmath3 as a function of @xmath10 in fig.2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath3 in two ways by using eq.(4 ) and eq.(5 ) independently , one is obtained by combining the charge velocity @xmath54 and the charge susceptibility @xmath45 and the other is expressed by the drude weight . </S>",
    "<S> the result shows that the values of @xmath3 obtained by in the two different ways are well consistent with each other except for @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show @xmath3 obtained by the @xmath48-ology together in fig.2(a ) . in the weak coupling regime , </S>",
    "<S> the results of numerical diagonalization are in good agreement with those of the @xmath48-ology . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the luttinger liquid theory can be applied to the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model successfully and finite - size effect of @xmath3 is not so large .    </S>",
    "<S> to judge which of the two estimations of @xmath3 is better from a point of view of finite - size effect , we watch the values of @xmath3 at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the one from eq.(4 ) is equal to 0.972 and the other from eq.(5 ) is 1.002 . </S>",
    "<S> taking account of @xmath3 being always equal to unity in noninteracting case , we infer that the estimation from eq.(5 ) is better than the other . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , the comparison of those values of @xmath3 with the values obtained in the @xmath48-ology in the weak coupling regime also indicates that the estimation of @xmath3 from eq.(5 ) gives a better result . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will use the value of @xmath3 expressed by eq.(5 ) in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.2(a ) shows that @xmath3 decreases as @xmath10 increases when @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath3 increases with @xmath10 for @xmath91 and diverges at @xmath92 where the charge susceptibility diverges . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence indicates that the width of the effective band @xmath87 is close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 is larger than unity , the sc correlation is expected to be most dominant compared with cdw and sdw correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the region where @xmath93 appears at @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be fairly small , but surely exists . to confirm the ground state to be in the sc state </S>",
    "<S> , we show the ground state energy @xmath4 as a function of an external flux @xmath5 in fig.2(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous flux quantization occurs at @xmath95 , where @xmath3 is about 2.0 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath96 , @xmath3 is less than unity and the anomalous flux quantization is not found . </S>",
    "<S> these results support that the sc phase really appears at @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> generally speaking , the sc phase is induced by an attractive interaction between quasi - particles . to examine the effective attraction </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the repulsive interactions @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) between the nearest - neighbor @xmath0-@xmath0 ( @xmath1-@xmath1 ) sites and the repulsion @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> if those repulsions act between a relevant pair of holes or cancel the effective attraction , the sc state is expected to be suppressed and @xmath3 is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath97 does not affect @xmath3 , but @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , as well as @xmath98 , decreases it . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that the relevant pair of holes sit not on the @xmath0-sites but on the @xmath1-sites and the strength of the attraction is of order of @xmath101.@xcite    finally , we investigate the critical exponent @xmath3 in detail and obtain the phase diagram in the @xmath102 parameter plane . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows a contour map of @xmath3 for @xmath103 system . </S>",
    "<S> the region sandwiched between two lines with @xmath104 and @xmath105 is corresponding to the sc region . </S>",
    "<S> the region is very small for small @xmath10 , however , it increases with @xmath10 .    in the h.f . </S>",
    "<S> approximation , the renormalized band @xmath87 becomes flat at a critical value @xmath106 which is given as @xmath107 here , the approximation breaks down for @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the point of @xmath109 corresponds to that of @xmath105 . in the noninteracting system ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath110 for @xmath73 . as @xmath10 increases </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath106 decreases as shown in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the line of @xmath106 is near that of @xmath105 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have numerically diagonalized the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model with finite sizes . paying special attention to the role of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated chemical potential and critical exponent @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also showed the anomalous flux quantization observed in the sc state . using the luttinger liquid relations , we have found that the sc correlation is dominant compared with the cdw and sdw correlations in the proximity of the parameter region where the renormalized band becomes flat . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed that @xmath2 enhances the charge fluctuation and promotes the sc correlation as @xmath12 does . </S>"
