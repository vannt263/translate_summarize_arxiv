    "the possibility of transforming an atomic condensate into a molecular condensate is presently a major challenge @xcite .",
    "several routes are considered to couple a condensate of free atoms with a condensate of molecules which are all in the same vibrational state of a molecular electronic potential .",
    "a feshbach resonance in the electronic ground state can be swept by a time - dependent magnetic field and recent experiments @xcite have observed oscillations in the number of atoms in the condensate .",
    "alternatively , the photoassociation process , which can be considered as an optically induced feshbach resonance , creates a molecular condensate in an excited electronic state . in the latter case ,",
    "a stabilization process must be introduced to avoid destruction of this condensate by spontaneous emission as was observed recently @xcite . a two - pulse stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage )",
    "scheme has been theoretically discussed @xcite in view of transferring the population to bound levels in the ground electronic state .",
    "+ in a nondegenerate gas , ultracold molecules are formed through combination of a photoassociation step with a stabilization step using spontaneous emission @xcite . in both cases",
    "the efficiency is controlled by the dipole transition moments , which depend markedly upon details of the electronic potential curves : the search for efficient mechanisms relies upon accurate spectroscopic data @xcite and it was shown that whereas photoassociation is efficient at large internuclear distances , the stabilization process is governed by the probability of finding the two atoms at intermediate distances@xcite .",
    "making ultracold molecules thus involves an interplay between long - range and short - range dynamics . up to now , most experiments have used cw lasers .",
    "the use of chirped pulses , _ ie _ laser pulses with a time - dependent frequency , could increase the formation rates @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , sweeping a time - dependent magnetic field through a feshbach resonance is equivalent to photoassociating with a chirped pulse .    in a condensate , most theoretical treatments at present rely upon coupled gross - pitaevski equations , where the dynamics in the atomic and the molecular condensates as well as the coupling between them , are described by mean - field effective potentials @xcite .",
    "details of the potentials are omitted owing to a delta function approximation ( contact potential ) .",
    "the knowledge of the molecular potential curves and dipole transition moments is necessary only to determine scattering lengths , binding energies and to accurately compute the coupling parameter between atomic and molecular phases .",
    "the success of such calculations relies on the very short time scale of the microscopic dynamics compared to the condensate dynamics .",
    "+ the validity of the ( one - body ) mean - field approximation has been recently questioned by several authors , particularly in the case of a time - dependent coupling term , and models using hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations of motion have been proposed @xcite . however , such calculations rely on the delta function approximation for the potentials and coupling terms .",
    "the ultraviolet divergence caused by this approximation is solved by a renormalization procedure , as discussed in detail by kokkelmans et al .",
    "recently , cherny and shanenko @xcite have shown that in the description of the dynamics of an atomic condensate , issues associated with the contact potentials can be avoided by considering the exact potential and pair wave functions having the correct nodal structure at short interatomic distance .",
    "the aim of the present work is to revisit the problem of coupled atomic and molecular condensates in the framework of a cherny treatment . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we shall consider only a two - channel model for feshbach resonance or photoassociation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first present a three - field model describing a two - channel coupling in a bose system .",
    "we then derive one - body and two - body mean - field equations , and show how the pair wave functions can be eliminated and lead to effective one - body mean - field equations , without using contact potentials . in the last section , we interpret the one - colour photoassociation of a bec in terms of one - body and two - body modes .",
    "definitions of the pair wave functions in an inhomogeneous system are given in the appendix .",
    "we consider three kinds of atoms in the atomic - molecular system : the ground - state atoms ( @xmath0 ) , colliding in the lower channel and the atoms ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) of the bound pairs in the upper channel . as described in figs.[fig : channels ] , the free atoms @xmath0 , interact through the potential @xmath3 , while the molecules vibrate in the potential @xmath4 . in the case of photoassociation , the latter potential corresponds to an excited electronic state of the molecule .",

    "indeed , when two atoms come close to each other , their internal states change because their electronic clouds overlap .",
    "this means that , for instance , the ket @xmath13 is related to the `` molecular '' ket @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the molecular electronic ket depending on the distance @xmath16 .",
    "bearing in mind this phenomenological aspect , we can write the many - body hamiltonian of the system in terms of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the atoms and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the internal energies of isolated atoms ( see fig.[fig : channels ] ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the potential trapping the atoms , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the interaction potential between atoms of the lower ( upper ) channel , and @xmath25 is the matrix element coupling the two channels ( which can be time - dependent ) .",

    "let us first consider a purely atomic system ( thus ignoring the terms involving any field @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ operatordyn_a ] ) now simply reads : @xmath58    in the condensed phase , one usually assumes a non - zero expectation value @xmath59 for the field operator @xmath60 , corresponding to a macroscopically occupied state ( see the appendix ) .",
    "what is sometimes referred to as `` naive mean - field '' consists in replacing the field operators by their averages directly in the equation of motion ( [ pureatomicmotion_a ] ) , thus neglecting the quantum fluctuations @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to a non - linear schrdinger equation with a coupling constant of the form @xmath62 .",

    "the interatomic potential exhibits a strong repulsive hard - core which leads to a divergent coupling constant .",
    "the usual remedy is to replace the real interaction by an effective one @xcite , generally a contact potential @xmath64 ( which does satisfy the born approximation ) having the same scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting equation , known as the gross - pitaevski equation @xcite , forms an `` effective mean - field '' theory , in which only the large - scale effects of the interaction are retained : @xmath65    this method can be rigorously justified by considering the effect of two - body correlations @xcite . an intuitive way of taking these correlations into account is to use pair wave functions .",
    "just as most atoms are individually described by the same macroscopic wave function @xmath66 , most pairs of atoms are described by the same macroscopic pair wave function @xmath67 , which turns out to be simply the anomalous average @xmath68 ( see eq .",

    "it is known from collision theory @xcite that this state is related to the s - wave scattering length @xmath0 : @xmath87    when taking the expectation value of the equation of motion ( [ pureatomicmotion_a ] ) , one finds the term @xmath88 , which can be approximated by @xmath89 when neglecting the collisions of non - condensed atoms with condensed atoms @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "if we assume again that the averaged field @xmath91 is nearly uniform on the scale of @xmath72 , the interaction term becomes at equilibrium : @xmath92    where we used ( [ scatteringlength ] ) .",
    "thus we retrieve the mean - field term in the gross - pitavski equation ( [ grosspitaevskii ] ) : it is in fact regularised by the stationary two - body correlations described by @xmath79 .",
    "we now apply these ideas to the atomic - molecular system , with the aim of deriving an effective mean - field theory . a first approach",

    "the condition ( [ condition ] ) shows that the one - body mean - field approach holds for sufficiently low densities , contrary to what has been suggested in ref .",
    "actually , in the case of photoassociation , the condition ( [ condition ] ) is usually achieved in the current experiments where the condensate is always dilute enough ( @xmath128 ) , and the franck - condon factor @xmath129 is sufficiently low ( @xmath130 ) .",

    "this may be seen as a consequence of the relations : @xmath178        @xmath182 is the wave function for two atoms in the same mode @xmath170 , and @xmath183 is the wave function for two atoms in the modes @xmath170 and @xmath184 . from counting arguments , we have @xmath185 pairs in the mode @xmath182 and @xmath186 pairs in the mode @xmath183 .",
    "one can check that this pair distribution does indeed satisfy the relation ( [ relation2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "these correlations @xmath189 are expected to vanish for interatomic distances larger than , say , the range @xmath190 of the interaction .",
    "the pair wave functions are thus asymptotically decorrelated ; this follows from the principle of correlation weakening@xcite .",
    "if the interaction supports bound states , one might also expect bound - pair wave functions @xmath191 , vanishing entirely for interatomic distances larger than @xmath190 .",
    "as the functions @xmath189 will scale like the functions @xmath170 and @xmath184 , it can be useful to express the correlations with dimensionless functions , which we refer to as `` reduced pair wave functions '' : @xmath192          when condensation occurs , most of the atoms are in the same quantum state , say @xmath196 .",
    "this means @xmath197 .",
    "accordingly , most of the pairs are in the same quantum state @xmath198 , corresponding to pairs of condensed atoms .",
    "a way of treating this situation , related to the bogoliubov ansatz , is to assume a breaking of the @xmath199 symmetry@xcite : the system is then in a coherent state @xmath200 satisfying @xmath201 . from the relation @xmath202 , we obtain @xmath203 and @xmath204 , so that the field operator has a non - zero expectation value @xmath205 .",
    "the deviations from the mean @xmath206 are the quantum fluctuations .",
    "this implies that the number of atoms now fluctuates and the relation ( [ relation2 - 1 ] ) derived for a fixed - number state is no more valid .",
    "however , this prescription is very useful to derive expressions for the one - body and two - body modes in terms of the quantum fluctuations . indeed ,",
    "if we expand the two - body density matrix in terms of @xmath207 :          are respectively the pair wave function for two condensed atoms , and the pair wave function for a condensed atom and a non - condensed atom in the mode @xmath100 .",
    "there is no simple expression for the pair wave function @xmath211 of two non - condensed atoms , nor the bound - pair wave functions @xmath212 , since these are contained in the term @xmath213 .",
    "if we assume that there is no interaction between the non - condensed atoms ( which is the case in the usual hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach ) , we may use wick s theorem to expand this term : @xmath214      as expected in this case , only the condensed pairs are correlated , through the anomalous correlation @xmath216 .",
    "this means the condensed atoms interact only with each other , while the non - condensed atoms are treated as an ideal gas .",
    "however , this is an approximation , since all the atoms feel the interaction .",
    "as we shall see , we actually need the correlations in order to regularise mean - field terms appearing in the equations of motion for the one and two - body modes .",
    "the evolution of the condensate mode is simply obtained by taking the average of the equation of motion for the field operator ( [ operatordyn_a ] ) .",
    "doing this , we encounter the average @xmath217 , which can be expanded and then factorized in terms of pair wave functions : @xmath218    we also have to express the average @xmath219 which can be simplified to @xmath220 if we assume that the atoms of the upper channel are paired in a purely coherent field @xmath31 .",
    "the equation of motion for the condensed mode is then : @xmath221    we can then derive the evolution of the one - body density matrix for the non - condensed atoms @xmath222 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ operatordyn_a ] ) , ( [ fourfields ] ) , ( [ fielddyn_0 ] ) , and neglecting the pair wave functions @xmath211 for two non - condensed atoms , we get : @xmath223              as long as its wavelength is greater than @xmath190 .",
    "the interpretation of eqs .",
    "( [ phi_0 ] ) and ( [ phi_i ] ) is straightforward .",
    "every condensed atom evolving in the trap can collide with another condensed atom or with any non - condensed atoms , and it can also associate with another condensed atom to form a molecule . similarly ,",
    "every non - condensed atom evolving in the trap can collide with any condensed atom ( we neglected the collisions with other non - condensed atoms ) .",
    "note that , within the approximation of a purely coherent molecular field , the non - condensed modes are not directly affected by the formation of molecules .        with @xmath232 .",
    "( [ phi_0 ] ) , one can then deduce the equation of motion for the reduced pair wave function @xmath72 : @xmath233    \\varphi_{00}({\\bf x},{\\bf y } )    \\nonumber    \\\\    & + & \\sqrt2 h^*_{int}({\\bf x},{\\bf y})\\frac{\\phi_m({\\bf x},{\\bf y})}{\\psi_0({\\bf x})\\psi_0({\\bf y})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "these many - body terms are caused by the interaction with other atoms external to the pair considered .",
    "at sufficiently low densities , we can make two basic assumptions about the reduced pair wave function :    h1 : : :    its extent @xmath236 is much smaller than the typical    length scale of the condensate h2 : : :    it is not much influenced by remaining many - body terms like    @xmath237 and @xmath83 .",
    "the many - body effects on the pair    dynamics are thus only caused by the mean fields @xmath100 ,    through the relations ( [ reduced_ii ] ) and ( [ reduced_ij ] ) .",
    "the pair wave function @xmath103 for a condensed atom and a non - condensed atom in the mode @xmath239 is given by @xmath240 , following from eq .",
    "( [ threefields ] ) . differentiating this expression and using the assumptions @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    ", we find for the reduced pair wave function @xmath106 : @xmath241 within our approximations , a pair involving a non - condensed atom is not directly affected by the coupling between the channels .",
    "this may indicate that one actually needs the quantum fluctuations of the molecular field for these modes .",
    "these factors are proportional to scattering amplitudes .",
    "note that the amplitudes are twice larger for pairs of condensed and non - condensed atoms ; this comes from the fact that the atoms are in different states , so that the symmetrization ( [ general_psi_ij ] ) induces a factor of two relative to a pair of condensed atoms . as a consequence , the effective potentials felt by the condensed atoms and the non - condensed atoms are different .",
