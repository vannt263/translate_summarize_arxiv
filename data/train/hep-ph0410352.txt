    "in spite of all our recent progress in the understanding of physics at the electroweak scale , the source of dark matter ( dm ) and the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry  @xcite ( bau ) still remain unclear .",
    "it is today well understood that the solution to either of these problems requires physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .    on the one hand",
    "if the standard model baryon number violating interactions  @xcite cease to be in equilibrium in the bubbles of the broken phase , the matter - antimatter asymmetry may be generated at the electroweak phase transition via the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "for such a mechanism to be realized in nature a strongly first order electroweak phase transition is required . however",
    "the phase transition in the standard model for values of the higgs mass consistent with the lep bounds is a crossover  @xcite and hence any baryon asymmetry generated at the weak scale would be erased .",
    "moreover , the sources of cp - violation are insufficient to generate a baryon number consistent with the one observed in nature  @xcite .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis remains nevertheless as an attractive possibility in models of physics beyond the standard model at the weak scale .",
    "it has been shown that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is consistent with this mechanism provided one of the superpartners of the top quark is lighter than the top quark and the higgs boson is lighter than @xmath1120 gev  @xcite@xcite .",
    "this mechanism also demands the presence of charginos and neutralinos at the weak scale , which provide the necessary cp - violating sources  @xcite@xcite and also a natural dark matter candidate .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis may also be realized in the next - to minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( nmssm ) where some of the mssm constraints can be relaxed .",
    "in particular there are modifications to the tree - level effective potential  @xcite that may ensure a strongly first order phase transition  @xcite@xcite without a light stop .    on the other hand the standard model does not provide any natural source for the observed dark matter .",
    "neutrinos are too light to give any sizeable contribution and there is no evidence of the possible existence of sufficient jupiter - like , baryonic objects .",
    "moreover , recent wmap measurements  @xcite-@xcite exclude the presence of a significant baryonic contribution to the observed dark matter density .",
    "the natural candidates for the source of dark matter are new , neutral , stable , weakly interacting particles with masses of the order of the weak scale .",
    "these particles lead naturally to a relic density of the order of the critical density and appear in many models beyond the standard model .",
    "in particular they are present in models of softly broken supersymmetry at the tev scale .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle in these models tends to be neutral and its stability is ensured by a parity symmetry , @xmath2 , which also ensures the proton stability .",
    "acceptable values of the dark matter density and a successful realization of the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis may be simultaneously obtained in minimal supersymmetric models , in certain phenomenologically interesting regions of the parameter space  @xcite ,  @xcite .    in the previous models , as well as in all successfully considered scenarios , the strengthening of the phase transition proceeds from the existence of new , extra scalars in the theory , while the cp - violating and dark matter sources proceed from new fermion fields .",
    "the common lore from all previous works was that the presence of extra bosons was a necessary requirement to induce a strong enough first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "in fact it is currently understood that bosons coupled to the higgs field @xmath3 with coupling @xmath4 favor a first order phase transition : they create a cubic term in the higgs effective potential @xmath5 either at the tree level , as in the nmssm , or by its contribution to the one - loop thermal effective potential @xmath6 . on the other hand fermions",
    "do not give rise to any cubic term in the high temperature expansion in powers of @xmath7 of the thermal integrals and hence they were neither believed to give rise to a barrier between the symmetric @xmath8 and broken @xmath9 phases nor to trigger a first order phase transition .",
    "in this paper we will prove that while the latter statement remains true for weakly coupled fermions @xmath10 it is not for strongly coupled ( but still perturbative ) ones @xmath11 that can indeed induce a strongly first order phase transition consistent with electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "in this work we shall first show that in standard model extensions with extra fermions strongly coupled to the higgs field the first order phase transition may be sufficiently strengthened in order to avoid erasure of the baryon asymmetry in the broken phase .",
    "we shall analyze in detail a simple model , which can be considered as a particular realization of split supersymmetry  @xcite , where the standard supersymmetric relations between the yukawa and gauge couplings are not fulfilled .",
    "we shall stress , however , that in such a model , the physical vacuum becomes unstable and therefore the strength of the electroweak phase transition may not be properly defined without an ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of this model , that includes the presence of heavier , stabilizing fields .",
    "an example of such fields may be provided by softly broken supersymmetry , although other extensions are possible .",
    "we shall show that this low - energy effective theory , with higgsinos and gauginos strongly coupled to the higgs , may arise from a soft supersymmetry breaking model , based on a gauge extension of the standard model gauge group , with new ( asymptotically free ) gauge interactions that become strong at the tev scale , and are responsible for the strong yukawa couplings of higgsinos and gauginos to the sm higgs field .",
    "this gauge extension of the mssm provides a uv completion of the model analyzed in this paper and allows for large higgs masses .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ phase ]",
    "we present the general ideas leading to the strengthening of the phase transition in the presence of strongly coupled fermions , and the need for the presence of stabilizing fields . in section  [ higgsinos ] the phase transition for the standard model extension containing higgsinos , winos and binos strongly coupled to the higgs field",
    "is worked out in detail .",
    "we show that a strong enough first order phase transition can be accommodated even with a heavy higgs , @xmath0 gev . in section  [ cp ]",
    "the cp - violating currents induced by the charginos that lead to the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe for natural values of cp - violating phases are presented .",
    "we show that in order to reproduce the wmap results on the bau the cp - violating phases must be @xmath12 if all squarks are heavy enough to be decoupled from the thermal bath .",
    "otherwise if some light squark ( e.g.  the right - handed stop ) remains in the spectrum , the cp - violating phases can be as small as a few times @xmath13 . in section  [ edm ] the two - loop contributions to the electron electric dipole moment from the charginos and neutralinos in our model ( in the absence of light squarks )",
    "are evaluated , assuming that all relevant cp - violating effects are associated with the new fermions . for the values of the parameters satisfying all other requirements the generated electric dipole moment",
    "is below the present experimental bound , although the model may be tested in the future if experimental bounds improve by a few orders of magnitude . in section  [ dark ]",
    "we discuss the dark matter constraints in our scenario , whereas compatibility of the strongly coupled fermions with electroweak precision measurements is considered in section  [ precision ] .",
    "a natural region in the space of parameters is found where all requirements are fulfilled .",
    "a discussion on a possible uv completion of the model is presented in section  [ strongc ] .",
    "finally we reserve section  [ conclusions ] for our conclusions .",
    "the finite temperature effective potential of the higgs field @xmath3 is , by definition , the free - energy associated with @xmath3 .",
    "the one - loop , finite temperature contribution to the free - energy density is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) of the particle , @xmath16 is the higgs - dependent particle mass , and @xmath17 where @xmath18 [ @xmath19 stands for the contribution from bosons [ fermions ] . in this section",
    "we will consider for simplicity masses of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath4 is the yukawa coupling and @xmath21 is a constant mass parameter   as it will be the case in the model considered in section  [ higgsinos ] . ] .",
    "for large masses ( @xmath22 ) the functions @xmath23 are exponentially small , which means that heavy species are decoupled from the thermal plasma . for small masses ( @xmath24 ) @xmath23 can be expanded in a power series of @xmath25 .",
    "this is the case of the minimal standard model .",
    "in fact adding this expansion to the zero - temperature effective potential in the sm one obtains the well known expression for the free - energy density @xmath26 where the first term comes from the entropy density contribution of relativistic particles , with @xmath27 the number of effectively light species in the plasma  @xcite ( @xmath28 for the sm ) , and the second term is the field dependent effective potential @xmath29 in the sm the parameters of eq .",

    "notice that the parameter @xmath35 is very small because only the ( transverse ) gauge bosons contribute to it and , as a consequence , @xmath36 is much smaller than @xmath37 ( unless @xmath38 ) and the phase transition is very weakly first - order   the transition becomes second order in the one - loop approximation . ] .",
    "moreover , for physical values of the higgs mass , the small value of @xmath39 causes perturbation theory to break down and only non - perturbative calculations become reliable . to overcome this problem sm extensions containing extra bosons",
    "strongly coupled to the higgs sector have been considered in the literature  @xcite .",
    "in general these bosons would contribute to the parameter @xmath35 and would strengthen the first order phase transition . in this paper we will prove that a similar effect is produced by fermions strongly coupled to the higgs sector , even if in the high temperature regime they do not contribute to the cubic term in the effective potential .",
    "in general we will consider particle species that contribute to the one - loop effective potential as in eq .",
    "( [ bucle ] ) , not light enough for the validity of the power expansion of @xmath40 but not necessarily so heavy as to consider them to be decoupled in the typical range of temperatures of the electroweak phase transition . the @xmath3-dependent part of the free energy density",
    "would then be given by @xmath41 /2\\pi ^{2},\\ ] ] where the first term is given by eq .",
    "( [ feffsm ] ) , the last one is the finite temperature contribution of the new , heavy particles , @xmath42 is the zero temperature contribution , and the plus and minus signs in front of @xmath42 correspond to bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "the zero - temperature one - loop effective potential @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a polynomial in @xmath3 that contains quadratic and quartic terms with coefficients that depend on the renormalization conditions  @xcite . by imposing the renormalization conditions already used in the sm , eq .  ( [ veff ] ) , in particular that the tree - level values of the minimum and higgs mass are not shifted by radiative corrections ,  i.e. @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 with @xmath48 where we are using the notation : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and so on . for the case where the @xmath3 dependence of the mass eigenvalue is @xmath51 the potential ( [ vimi ] ) has the familiar expression @xmath52 .\\ ] ]    let us first stress that , unless the higgs is heavy , strongly coupled fermions may create a problem of vacuum stability at scales close to the electroweak scale .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that the tree - level quartic coupling , defined as the coefficient of the quartic term in the effective potential , is given by @xmath53 and the radiative corrections are proportional to the fourth power of the yukawa coupling , @xmath4 , and to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , a relevant effect may only be obtained for a value of the number of degrees of freedom times @xmath54 larger than @xmath55 . for such values vacuum stability",
    "occurs at scales of the order of tev and therefore the presence of new , stabilizing fields is necessary in order to define a consistent low - energy effective theory .",
    "an efficient way of stabilizing the potential in the presence of strongly coupled fermions is to assume the presence of heavy bosonic degrees of freedom with similar couplings and number of degrees of freedom . for simplicity ,",
    "let us here assume that the fermions have a dispersion relation @xmath56 , and a number of degrees of freedom @xmath57 , and there are bosonic , stabilizing fields with a dispersion relation @xmath58 with equal number of degrees of freedom . then , taking into account only the radiative corrections associated with these heavy fields , the maximum value of @xmath59 consistent with vacuum stability may be obtained from the condition of a positive quartic coupling at scales much larger than @xmath60 , and it is given by @xmath61 observe that for heavy higgs bosons and/or weakly coupled fermions @xmath59 becomes much larger than the weak scale .",
    "if , however , @xmath4 takes large values and @xmath62 becomes light then @xmath59 approaches @xmath63 and the effect of stabilizing fields is to cancel the zero temperature contribution of fermions plus giving additional finite temperature contributions .    in order to get an understanding of the effects to be expected by the presence of these new particles , let us first consider a fermion particle with a mass , @xmath64 , much larger than @xmath37 for @xmath65 . if this effect is obtained for large values of the yukawa coupling , then the sum of the effects of the fermions and the stabilizing fields at zero temperature is small and , in this extreme case that maximizes the contribution of fermions ( and that of the stabilizing fields ) to the phase transition , we can ignore the zero temperature contributions .",
    "then , in the symmetric phase the species is light and contributes to @xmath27 , but in the broken - symmetry phase it is heavy and approximately decouples from the thermal plasma .",
    "usually such a decoupling species would transfer its entropy to the thermal bath , causing a temperature rise . during a phase transition we would naively expect that the effect of such a reheating is to _ delay _ the appearance of the true vacuum , to decrease the critical temperature and subsequently to increase the value of @xmath39 .",
    "more quantitatively , at constant @xmath27 the critical temperature is given by the condition @xmath66 , corresponding to degenerate minima of @xmath67  ] .",
    "as we will show below , this condition changes if the number of light degrees of freedom is different in the two phases , @xmath68 . in our example , the decoupling particle has a mass @xmath69 , and its contribution to the free - energy density in the broken phase vanishes , while in the symmetric phase is equal to @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is its number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the condition of degenerate minima of @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ freeen ] ) , then gives  @xcite @xmath73 this condition is attained at a lower critical temperature , @xmath74 .",
    "moreover we have that @xmath75 and the phase transition is more strongly first - order .",
    "it was already noticed in ref .  @xcite that @xmath76 in the context of the electroweak phase transition could be important for baryogenesis .",
    "we can now estimate @xmath77 by noticing that the value of the effective potential  ( [ veff ] ) at the minimum @xmath78 can be written as @xmath79 where we have made the approximation @xmath80 .",
    "( [ tcprima ] ) implies that @xmath81 for the order parameter to increase from @xmath82 to the value @xmath83 , necessary to preserve the baryon asymmetry  @xcite , we need @xmath84 .",
    "so it seems that particles with few d.o.f .",
    "will produce an effect .",
    "conversely given @xmath85 , the bound on the higgs mass is relaxed from @xmath86 to @xmath87 notice that if the new value @xmath36 is @xmath88 , then the perturbative ( one - loop ) approach is fully justified even for small values of @xmath35 .    it should be noticed that eqs .",
    "( [ tcprima])([deltafi ] ) give only an estimate of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , the effective number of light d.o.f . varies continuously from @xmath27 to @xmath91 , as @xmath3 goes from @xmath92 to @xmath90 .",
    "therefore we have a function @xmath93 that contributes to @xmath94 , and the correct value of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is obtained by minimizing the complete free energy , eq .",
    "( [ freeen ] ) .",
    "once the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath3 is taken into account , we can not use analytical approximations and we need to resort to numerical calculations . observe that in the limit studied above fermions and bosons gave equally important contributions to the phase transition strength and the number of degrees of freedom is the sum of the one associated to the fermions and that of stabilizing fields . in the rest of this work",
    "we will consider bosons that are heavier than the fermions , and therefore lead to a smaller finite temperature contribution than in the example above .",
    "we will now consider adding a fermion particle with mass @xmath96 to the sm with a higgs mass @xmath97  gev , but we will retain the effects of the heavy particles in the broken phase .",
    "we consider only fermion species and their ( heavier ) stabilizing fields since , as explained above , the effect of bosons on the phase transition has been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite ,  @xcite@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fermiones ] we plot the number of degrees of freedom @xmath57 that give @xmath98 as a function of the mass parameter @xmath21 , for different values of the yukawa coupling @xmath4 . the invariant mass of the stabilizing fields has been set to their maximum value consistent with vacuum stability , eq .",
    "( [ bosonstab ] ) .",

    "in order to construct an invariant yukawa lagrangian the simplest possibilities are , either doublet and singlet fermions ( as e.g.  a generation of mirror leptons and/or quarks ) or doublet and triplet fermions ( as e.g.  light higgsinos and gauginos ) remnant from ( split ) supersymmetry  @xcite . in the next section",

    "it is therefore an important question to understand under which conditions such a low energy effective theory may be obtained .",
    "one possibility is to assume that , although the quantum numbers of the light particles are those of higgsinos and gauginos of supersymmetric theories , the theory is not related to any supersymmetric theory at high energies .",
    "a more interesting possibility would be to consider this theory as a particular realization of split supersymmetry  @xcite , but where the particular relation between the yukawa couplings and the gauge couplings has been broken by supersymmetry breaking interactions .",
    "one of the problems with this alternative is the one of vacuum stability . in addition , due to the strong yukawa couplings ,",
    "perturbative consistency is lost at scales much lower than the gut scale and therefore perturbative unification of the gauge couplings can not be achieved .    in this section",
    "we shall show that this low energy effective theory may also arise in low energy supersymmetric models with extra , strongly coupled gauge sectors , if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is larger than the scale of spontaneous symmetry breakdown of the extended gauge sector to the standard model one .",

    "breaking terms the superpartners of @xmath393 would become the low energy winos , interacting with higgsinos and higgs bosons with the weak coupling @xmath394 . in order to get a strongly interacting wino - higgsino - higgs sector at low energies we need to decouple the bifundamental higgsinos @xmath395 , as well as the weakly interacting wino @xmath396 from the weak scale theory .",

    "the effective yukawa couplings between the low energy winos and the two higgsinos are therefore given by @xmath400 where we have assumed that the cp - odd higgs mass is larger than the weak scale , and therefore a single , sm - like , cp - even higgs boson remains in the low - energy theory .",
    "assuming @xmath401 we get that , in this realization of the low energy theory , the yukawa couplings @xmath402 .    on the other hand , a very large supersymmetric mass @xmath397 would also demand to be compensated in a precise way by a similarly large supersymmetry breaking mass in order to get the proper @xmath403 breaking scale .",
    "lower values of @xmath397 would reduce the strongly coupled gaugino component of the low - energy wino state and would require a fine - tuning between the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) in order to obtain a small value of the effective low - enegy wino mass . therefore in this model , a moderate amount of fine - tuning is required to get consistency with phenomenological constraints and a strong electroweak phase transition  .",
    "we can now ask if the strongly coupled gauge bosons may serve as the stabilizing bosonic fields defined in section  [ phase ] .",
    "let us first stress that the particular extension of the mssm presented above leads to extra contributions to the precision electroweak observables .",
    "small values of these extra contributions may only be obtained for values of @xmath404 larger than a few tev  @xcite . since @xmath404 acts as the bosonic mass @xmath59 defined in eq .",
    "( [ bosonstab ] ) , these particles can only act as stabilizing fields if the higgs is heavier than the range consistent with a strongly first order phase transition",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate possible regions of parameter space in which cancelations between different contributions take place and consistency with data may be achieved for lighter gauge boson masses . otherwise , additional fields would be necessary to stabilize the higgs potential .",
    "a very simple possibility , that has already been pointed out in section  [ precision ] is that the stabilizing fields are gauge singlets , harmless from the point of view of electroweak precision measurements .",
    "these singlets should couple strongly to the higgs sector , in order to stabilize the fermionic part of the zero - temperature effective potential , but should not contribute strongly to the higgs quartic coupling since in that case the phase transition would become weakly first order .",
    "a simple example of a model producing the required effect is given by a singlet superfield @xmath405 coupled to the higgs field doublets as well as to a set of @xmath350 singlet fields @xmath406 , with superpotential @xmath407 where all couplings and the masses @xmath408 and @xmath409 are positive .",
    "the absence of a coupling of the singlet fields @xmath406 to the higgs doublets as well as the appearence of only terms proportional to @xmath410 in the superpotential may be understood as a result of the invariance of the theory under a global @xmath411 symmetry .",
    "the supersymmetric masses of the singlet fields , @xmath408 and @xmath409 , are assumed to be much larger than the weak scale , suppressing the mixing of light singlet fermions with the standard gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "we shall also assume that there are supersymmetry breaking effects in the bosonic @xmath412-sector that prevent the possibility of integrating out the superfields @xmath412 from the weak - scale theory and allow the bosonic @xmath412-sector to be the stabilizing fields with mass given by ( [ bosonstab ] ) .",
    "such supersymmetry breaking effects should also ensure the preservation of the modifications to the low - energy higgs quartic coupling induced by the presence of the superfields @xmath412 in the theory .",
    "furthermore we will assume that the superfield @xmath405 can be integrated out supersymmetrically so that for scales below @xmath409 it gives rise to an effective superpotential as @xmath413 the above superpotential gives rise to a coupling in the tree - level potential between the @xmath357 sector and the higgs sector , @xmath414 to an @xmath103-quartic coupling as @xmath415 , where ~_2 ^ 22 , and to a self - interacting quartic coupling @xmath416 fields _ s ~ _ 1 ^ 2 .",
    "since we have concentrated in this work on the results obtained in the model with strongly interacting gauginos and higgsinos for small values of @xmath306 , the value of @xmath218 , and therefore @xmath417 . for @xmath418 and @xmath419 , one obtains values @xmath420 , necessary for the singlets @xmath406 to stabilize the one - loop higgs potential against the fermion contribution . on the other hand , for @xmath421 , as required to obtain a good description of the dark matter relic density and precision electroweak observables ,",
    "the contribution to the quartic coupling is not too large .",
    "this has implications for the higgs boson mass .",
    "in fact , for values of @xmath218 , the d - term contribution to the higgs mass is small and the higgs mass may be raised above ( or around ) the mssm values , due to the tree - level contribution m_h^2  2v^2 + ( loop - effects ) + ( d - term )  .",
    "values of the higgs mass of order 115200  gev may be naturally obtained for @xmath422 0.10.3 , that appear in this model for values of @xmath409 of the order of the tev scale and values of @xmath423 somewhat larger than one . by choosing the appropriate value of @xmath350 and the values of the couplings @xmath424",
    ", one can reach a situation similar to the one described in the previous sections .",
    "a detailed analysis of the parameter space in this particular model is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this article we have shown that heavy fermions with strong couplings to the higgs fields may induce a strengthening of the electroweak phase transition and can also provide the proper cp - violating sources for the generation of baryogenesis .",
    "these heavy fermions , however , also induce for light higgs bosons an instability of the higgs potential at zero temperature and therefore require an ultraviolet completion of the theory to recover the consistency of the low - energy theory . in this work",
    ", we have assumed that the heavier , stabilizing fields have oposite statistics but similar couplings and number of degrees of freedom as the fermion fields .",
    "the above properties are then associated with the low energy theory consisting both of the heavy fermions and the heavier , stabilizing fields .",
    "we have illustrated this possibility by considering a model with tev scale higgsinos and gauginos that may lead to a sufficiently strong first order electroweak phase transition for values of the higgs mass as large as 300  gev .",
    "this is quite different from the results of the mssm , in which a light stop is necessary , and the higgs mass should be lower than @xmath1 120  gev to enhance the strength of the electroweak phase transition . also at variance with the case of the mssm",
    "is the fact that in this scenario the particles that induce a strong first order phase transition are the same ones responsible for the generation of the baryon asymmetry at the weak scale .",
    "this model preserves most of the properties of low energy supersymmetry , including a good dark matter candidate . beyond the problem of vacuum stability , however , the low - energy yukawa couplings deviate from the ones obtained in minimal supersymmetric extensions of the sm , and their strength spoils the perturbative consistency of the theory at scales of about a few tev .",
    "we have shown , however , that the model may be considered as the low energy effective description of a gauge extended supersymmetric standard model , in which the strength of the yukawa couplings is related to the gauge couplings of an extended asymptotically free gauge sector , that becomes strongly interacting at tev scales .",
    "this ultraviolet completion of the model solves the strong coupling problem and introduces new heavy particles that , due to their supersymmetric relations to the higgsinos and gauginos , tend to stabilize the higgs potential in a natural way . the stability of the potential , however , may only be achieved for values of the heavy particle masses smaller than about 1 tev .",
    "these relatively small values of the heavy gauge boson masses lead to large corrections to the precision electroweak observables , unless cancellations between different contributions occur .",
    "alternatively , we also have shown that the model can be completed with singlets that may stabilize the zero - temperature effective potential while providing higgs masses consistent with present experimental bounds and with the required strongly first order phase transition .",
    "finally , we have shown that this model may be tested by electron electric dipole moment experiments in the near future .",

    "<S> new fermions , strongly coupled to the standard model higgs boson , provide a well motivated extension of the standard model ( sm ) . in this work we show that , once new physics at heavier scales is added to stabilize the higgs potential , such an extension of the sm can strengthen the first order electroweak phase transition and make the electroweak baryogenesis mechanism feasible . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a sm extension with tev higgsinos , winos and binos that satisfy the following properties : * a ) * the electroweak phase transition is strong enough to avoid sphaleron erasure in the broken phase for values of the higgs mass @xmath0  gev ; * b ) * it provides large cp - violating currents that lead to the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe for natural values of the cp - violating phase ; * c ) * it also provides a natural dark matter candidate that can reproduce the observed dark matter density ; * d ) * it is consistent with electroweak precision measurements ; * e ) * it may arise from a softly broken supersymmetric theory with an extra ( asymptotically free ) gauge sector ; * f ) * it may be tested by electron electric dipole moment experiments in the near future . </S>"
