    "xte  j1817 - 330 was discovered by the rossi x - ray timing experiment ( rxte ) on 26 january 2006 @xcite with a flux of 0.93(@xmath0 )  crab ( 2 - 12 kev ) and a very soft spectrum , typical for black hole transients .",
    "we obtained a target of opportunity observation ( too ) with xmm - newton ( 0.1 - 10.0  kev ) on 13 march 2006 ( obs .",
    "0311590501 , 20  ks ) , when the source flux detected by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board rxte had faded to @xmath1300  mcrab @xcite ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ lcs ] ) .",
    "we fit simultaneously the data of all xmm - newton instruments active during the observation : epic - pn ( 0.610.0  kev ; burst mode ) , rgs1 ( 0.32.0  kev ) and om ( u and uwv1 filters ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "we use a 2-component model consisting of a thermal accretion disk ( _ diskpn _ model available in _ xspec _",
    "@xcite ) plus a comptonization component ( _ comptt _ model @xcite ) to fit the spectrum of xte  j1817 - 330 . the inner radius in the _ diskpn _ model is fixed to 6@xmath2 .",
    "we obtain the best fit for the _ diskpn + comptt _ model ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath4 , a disk with @xmath5 and a comptonization component with kt@xmath6  kev ( fixed ) and @xmath7 .",
    "the observed x - ray flux is @xmath8 ( 0.4 - 10  kev ) , and the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of the source at the time of the observation l@xmath9 .    the normalization constant _ k _ of the _ diskpn _ model is related to the mass of the compact object _ m _ , the distance to the source _ d _ , and the inclination _",
    "i _ of the disk as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the color / effective temperature ratio .",
    "furthermore , the accretion rate can be obtained from the mass of the compact object and the maximum temperature of the disk @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath12 and using the best fit value for the normalization of the _ diskpn _ model ( @xmath13 ) , we can compare the accretion rate for different possible masses , distances , and inclinations with an upper limit for the accretion rate . at the time of the xmm - newton observations ,",
    "the flux of the source had decreased by a factor 6 with respect to the maximum registered by rxte .",
    "taking the eddington limit as the upper limit for the accretion rate at the maximum of the burst , the accretion rate at the time of the observation could not be higher than 16% of @xmath14 .",
    "this sets an upper limit for the mass of the central object of 6  m@xmath15 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "integral observed xte  j1817 - 330 in hard x - rays ( 20 - 150  kev ) as a too on 15 - 18 february 2006 @xcite ( 200  ks exposure ) .",
    "we fit simultaneously jem - x ( 630  kev ) and ibis / isgri ( 20200  kev ) spectral data obtained on 1518 february 2006 with a two component model , _ diskbb + pow_. the best fit ( @xmath16 ) is obtained with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , photon index @xmath19 and power - law normalization @xmath20@1  kev .",
    "on 28 february 2007 a new outburst of the previously known transient source xte  j1856 + 053 was detected with rxte @xcite .",
    "we obtained a too observation with xmm - newton ( 0.1 - 10.0  kev ) on 14 march 2007 ( obs .",

    "we fit simultaneously xmm - newton epic - pn ( 0.5510.0  kev , in timing mode ) , rgs1 and rgs2 ( 0.32.0  kev ) data ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum with a thermal accretion disk ( _ diskpn _ ) .",
    "no indication of a hard component is evident in the residuals , but an excess is present below 1 kev , leading to a poor reduced @xmath21 of 1.99 . adding a recombination emission edge at 0.87  kev ( corresponding to o  viii  k - shell ) with plasma temperature kt@xmath22  ev improves the fit .",
    "the significance of this feature is however to be taken with care , since the excess could be caused by some redistribution of higher energy photons to lower energies not properly taken into account by the calibration . the best fit ( @xmath23 )",
    "is then obtained with @xmath24 , and a disk with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the observed x - ray flux is @xmath27 ( 0.510.0  kev ) , which corrected for absorption corresponds to an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity l@xmath28 .",
    "the low temperature of the accretion disk favours a black - hole as the accreting compact object . with the normalization constant _ k _ of the _ diskpn _ model we can put some contraint to the mass of the compact object _ m _",
    ", as done above for xte j1817 - 330 . at the time of the xmm - newton observations ,",
    "the flux of the source was at the maximum of the first burst detected in march 2007 .",
    "however , a brigther burst was detected by rxte / asm in june 2007 . at the time of our xmm - newton observations , the flux was 70% of the maximum detected in june 2007 .",
    "taking the eddington limit as the upper limit for the accretion rate at the maximum in june 2007 , the accretion rate at the time of the xmm - newton observation could not be higher than @xmath29 .",
    "this sets an upper limit for the mass of the central object of 4.2  m@xmath15 .",
