    "@xmath0 meson decays are a rich source of information on fundamental phases of weak charge - changing couplings , as encoded in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",

    ".    in @xmath8 decays , where @xmath2 is a charmless pseudoscalar meson , flavor su(3 ) symmetries have been employed to extract weak phases in such decays as @xmath9 and various charge states of @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , the recent reviews of @xcite and a recent analysis @xcite of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the decays @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is a charmless vector meson , involve more invariant amplitudes , since one can not use bose statistics to simplify the decays , in contrast to the case of two spinless final pseudoscalars in the same meson multiplet @xcite . nonetheless , after the first report of a charmless @xmath6 decay @xcite , it became possible to perform such analyses by using rates and @xmath4 asymmetries in some decays to predict others .    in the present paper , following upon our recent analysis of @xmath8",
    "decays @xcite , we analyze @xmath6 decays within flavor su(3 ) , incorporating symmetry breaking through ratios of meson decay constants in tree ( @xmath3 ) amplitudes . the magnitudes and relative phases of invariant amplitudes are extracted from data ; the symmetry assumption is tested ; and predictions are made for rates and @xmath4 asymmetries in as - yet - unseen decay modes .",

    "many of these authors were able to fit some data but could not reproduce those processes dominated by strangeness - changing penguin amplitudes , which others have argued should be enhanced .",

    "there are four types of independent amplitudes : a `` tree '' contribution @xmath47 ; a `` color - suppressed '' contribution @xmath48 ; a `` penguin '' contribution @xmath49 ; and a `` singlet penguin '' contribution @xmath50 , in which a color - singlet @xmath51 pair produced by two or more gluons or by a @xmath52 or @xmath5 forms an su(3 ) singlet state .",

    "all fits predict @xmath106 , even if this equality is not enforced .",
    "this is largely due to the need for constructive interference between @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the decays @xmath109 , as proposed in ref.@xcite .",

    "these amplitudes interfere constructively in such processes as @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the corresponding ratio for @xmath120 is slightly larger , about 0.3 , helping to enhance the predicted rates for @xmath121 .",
    "a similar constructive interference between @xmath122 and @xmath3 terms appears to account for an enhancement of the @xmath123 decay ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "small strong phases ( mod @xmath105 ) are favored , implying that the relative strong phase between @xmath91 and @xmath61 is small .",

    "the pattern of strong and weak phases obtained here is such that there is a small amount of constructive tree - penguin interference in the @xmath4-averaged branching ratios for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and a small amount of destructive interference in @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the preference of the fits for large values of @xmath5 ( small values of @xmath128 ) , when final - state phases are small mod @xmath105 , is due in part to the fact that these interference effects are relatively small .",
    "we shall comment below on details which depend on specific assumptions .",
    "first we discuss some specific decay modes for which predictions are fairly stable over the range of assumptions .",
    "the decay @xmath129 is predicted to be dominated by the @xmath130 amplitude and thus to have zero @xmath4 asymmetry .",
    "its branching ratio is expected to be about @xmath131 , considerably below present upper limits .",
    "any deviations from these predictions could indicate the importance of an annihilation amplitude or , equivalently , important rescattering effects .",
    "one expects a similar or slightly larger prediction for @xmath132 .",
    "a non - zero negative @xmath4 asymmetry is predicted for @xmath118 , as a result of the interference of the amplitudes @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in our favored solution ( with @xmath88 ) this arises as the result of a small but non - negligible relative final - state phase @xmath135 .",
    "the same phase contributes a @xmath4 asymmetry of opposite sign to @xmath136 and @xmath137 , as we shall see below .",
    "it appears to be generated in our fit by the appreciable @xmath4 asymmetry in @xmath138 , and also leads to a non - zero prediction for @xmath139 .    the decay @xmath140 is expected to have a branching ratio of about @xmath141 , consistent with the recently reported level @xcite .    the decay @xmath142 , dominated by an amplitude coming from the electroweak penguin in @xmath143 , is included for completeness .",
    "we do not expect it to be observed any time soon .",
    "the corresponding predicted rates for @xmath144 are factors of ( 2,3,6 ) smaller , respectively .    the branching ratio for the newly observed decay @xmath145 @xcite is well reproduced , in part because of the enhancement associated with the constructive interference between @xmath61 and @xmath146 .",
    "the large value of @xmath146 is driven by the attempt to fit an even larger branching ratio for @xmath147 reported in the same experiment .",
    "the penguin contributions are expected to cancel if @xmath148 , so both of these decays are expected to have zero or very small @xmath4 asymmetries .",
    "this stands in contrast to the large asymmetries expected for @xmath149 and @xmath150 @xcite . in @xmath151 , the qcd penguin contributions associated with the @xmath152 and @xmath153 components of the @xmath154 nearly cancel one another if @xmath155 , while in @xmath156 , these contributions reinforce one another .",
    "we predict @xmath157 , whereas the observed ratio exceeds 1 .",
    "this may reflect a shortcoming of our description of the @xmath158 wave function , which has been argued in ref.@xcite to contain important symmetry - breaking effects .",
    "we are unable to accommodate the large central value of the @xmath4 asymmetry in @xmath124",

    "the predictions for @xmath163 and @xmath164 include a small tree contribution whereas no such contribution is expected for the corresponding decays @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "this leads us to expect a slight enhancement of @xmath167 with respect to @xmath168 , as suggested by the data .",
    "the successful prediction of the rates for @xmath169 is due in large part to the inclusion of the ewp contribution , interfering constructively in each case with the main qcd penguin term .",
    "small @xmath4 asymmetries are predicted in @xmath163 and @xmath165 . the considerable suppression of the decays involving @xmath158 reflects the destructive interference of the @xmath160 and @xmath107 contributions @xcite .",

    "this implies that additional electroweak penguin contributions in the form of the @xmath175 term in @xmath176 ( see table [ tab : ds1 ] ) do not considerably affect the branching ratio of this decay .",

    "measurement of its branching ratio would provide valued information on @xmath179 . as noted , the only upper limit on the branching ratio , @xmath180 , comes from the cleo collaboration , so it should be improved ( or the decay discovered ) very soon .    the rate difference sum rule ( [ eqn : ratep ] ) involving @xmath125 is seen in eq .",

    "the electroweak penguin component of the @xmath186 amplitude is responsible for interfering destructively with the @xmath160 component in this process .",
    "we expect a corresponding _ enhancement _ in @xmath187 , since the relative signs of @xmath186 and the dominant penguin amplitude @xmath160 are opposite in the two processes .",

    "most parameters of the fits appear to be relatively stable .",
    "this stability is due in part to the inclusion of @xmath200 and @xmath201 , which are the only quantities in which the interference between @xmath91 and @xmath61 is probed directly .",
    "small changes in relative strong phases occur when we relax the assumption that @xmath202 .",
    "the changes in predicted branching ratios and @xmath4 asymmetries appear to be so small that they will not be detected in the near future .",
    "the least stable aspect of the fits is associated with the amplitudes @xmath146 ( color - suppressed tree ) and @xmath203 , contributing to @xmath204 and @xmath186 .",
    "the need for a @xmath146 amplitude is associated with the large branching ratios for @xmath205 , but we still can not fit the large branching ratio for the last process .",
    "the @xmath81 minima at @xmath206 are associated with larger values of @xmath146 and @xmath203 , which lead to the predictions @xmath207 .",

    "when an independent measurement of the @xmath107 amplitude becomes available through the decay @xmath178 , this assumption will receive an independent check .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we assumed that the strong phase of the electroweak penguin contribution @xmath216 to @xmath115 and @xmath217 is the same as that of @xmath160 , and that the @xmath203 contribution differs in phase by @xmath218 with respect to @xmath107 .",
