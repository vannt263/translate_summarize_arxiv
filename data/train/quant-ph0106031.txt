    "the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) is a standard and important model which describes the interaction of an atom and a single mode radiation field in a cavity @xcite .",
    "the importance of this model is due not only to its exact solvability , but also arises from some of its purely quantum effects , such as the periodic collapse and revival of the atomic number population , and the behaviour of the cavity field which becomes a _",
    "schrdinger cat _ state - a phase - correlated superposition of two coherent states - at certain times . the jcm model has been generalized in many different ways .",
    "one such is the multiphoton generalization @xcite described by the following hamiltonian ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a positive integer , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are atomic operators , @xmath6 is the coupling constant , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the atomic transition frequency and cavity resonant mode frequency respectively .",
    "it is interesting that for both the one @xcite and two @xcite photon cases , the cavity field is in a schrdinger cat state at intervals corresponding to one half of the revival time .",
    "this arises from the fact that the rabi frequency in both cases is proportional to @xmath9 ( up to a constant ) in the approximation of large photon number @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall address the dynamics and quantum characteristics of the 4-photon jcm in the large photon number approximation . under this approximation the generalized rabi frequency ( eq.(2.3 ) ) depends on @xmath9 nonlinearly ( up to @xmath10 ) and this nonlinearity causes kerr nonlinearity in the cavity .",
    "we shall study the photon number distribution ( sec . 3 ) and the entropy of the cavity field ( sec.4 ) and the q - function ( sec . 5 ) .",
    "it is found that the cavity field is in a kerr state or a macroscopic superposition of two kerr states at certain times .",
    "we also study the atomic number inversion and find that it exhibits collapse and revival for short time intervals .",
    "we assume that at the initial time @xmath11 , the atom and field are decoupled and the atom is initially prepared in the excited state @xmath12 , while the field is in the coherent state @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a complex number . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider the on - resonance interaction case @xmath16 as in @xcite .",
    "then the combined atom - field wave function at time @xmath17 is obtained as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the _ scaled time _ and @xmath20 is the _ generalized rabi frequency _",
    "@xcite ( in units of @xmath21 ) @xmath22 in the large photon number case , namely when the average photon number @xmath23 is large enough ( @xmath24 , the poisson distribution @xmath25 is mainly concentrated near @xmath23 and we have @xmath26 .",
    "we now specialize to the case @xmath27 . to facilitate an analytical treatment , we write the generalized rabi frequency @xmath20 as @xmath28 for the large photon number case",
    ", @xmath29 is a small term and we can use the following taylor expansion @xmath30 here we can only neglect the terms in @xmath20 which are much smaller than 1 , namely , we must keep the terms to @xmath31 in ( [ sqx ] ) .",
    "this is because @xmath20 is the argument of _ trigonometric _ functions in the wave function ( [ wavefunc ] ) and a small constant ( for example @xmath32 ) can effect the physical quantity drastically .",
    "we therefore need to calculate the first three terms in ( [ sqx ] ) .",
    "we then obtain the approximate generalized rabi frequency @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here",
    "the constant terms ( 5 or 1 ) are much smaller than @xmath10 but can not be neglected .",
    "taking the trace in the atom space , one finds for the reduced density operator of the cavity field @xmath35,\\ ] ] from which the photon number distribution ( pnd ) @xmath36 is obtained as @xmath37 +      |c_{n-4}|^2 \\sin^2\\left[\\omega_{n-4}\\tau\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the pnd is a @xmath38-periodic function of the scaled time @xmath39 .",
    "this means that at @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 , a poisson distribution . at @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 , where we have used that fact that @xmath44 is always an odd integer .",
    "this means that the pnd is also a poisson distribution , but displaced by 4 .",
    "however , the wave function ( pure state ) is not necessarily a coherent state ; we shall see in the next section that the wave function is actually a kerr state @xcite .",
    "when @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 and therefore @xmath47     + |c_{n-4}|^2   \\sin^2\\left [ ( n^2 - 3n+1)\\pi/4\\right ] .     \\label{pi4}\\ ] ] writing @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 then the pnd is finally obtained as @xmath50 namely , the average of pnd at @xmath51 and @xmath32 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "when @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the pnd is obtained as @xmath54 ,     \\label{pi8}\\ ] ] which is a strongly oscillating function ; in other words , the photon number distribution exhibits strong oscillation .",
    "writing @xmath55 , we can further write ( [ pi8 ] ) as @xmath56 so for any @xmath9 the photon number distribution is non - vanishing and , in that sense , the oscillation is not _",
    "perfect_. however , as can be seen from fig.1 , at the slightly earlier time @xmath57 , the photon number distribution exhibits perfect oscillation in that it becomes zero at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the entropy @xmath60 of a quantum - mechanical system is a measure of how close the system is to a _",
    "pure _ state and is defined by @xcite @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the density operator of the quantum system and the boltzmann constant is assumed to be unity .",
    "@xmath63 for a pure state and @xmath64 for a mixed state . in our model ,",
    "the initial state is prepared in a pure state , so the whole atom - field system remains in a pure state at any time @xmath65 and its entropy is always zero . however , due to the entanglement of the atom and the cavity field at @xmath65 , both the atom and the field are generally in mixed states , although at certain times the field and the atomic subsystems are ` almost ' in pure states .",
    "since the initial state is a pure state , the entropy @xmath66 of the cavity field equals the atomic entropy @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the entropy @xmath68 or @xmath69 , which is referred to as the _ entanglement _ of the total system in quantum information , is used to measure the amount of entanglement between the two subsystems . when @xmath70 , the system is _ disentangled _ or _ separable _ and both the field and atomic subsystems are in pure states .",
    "it is more convenient to calculate the entropy of the 2-level atomic system . from eq.([wavefunc ] ) the atomic reduced density operator @xmath71 can be readily obtained as @xmath72 where @xmath73 the field and atomic entropy @xmath74 can be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the eigenvalues of the atomic reduced field density operator @xmath71 @xmath77    noting that @xmath20 is an odd integer for large photon number , it is easy to see that the entropy @xmath66 of the cavity field is a @xmath38-periodic function of @xmath39 .",
    "we plot the entropy @xmath66 as a function of @xmath39 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 in fig.2 .",
    "we observe that the entropy is dynamically reduced to zero at @xmath32 and the cavity field can be periodically found in pure states .",
    "we also observe that the entropy falls quickly to minima _ near _ @xmath80 ( see also fig.3 ) .",
    "those calculated features can be explained analytically .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath68 implies that @xmath81 for any positive integer @xmath82 . in this case",
    "the wave function ( [ wavefunc ] ) can be readily obtained as @xmath83 namely , the cavity field is in the coherent state @xmath84 ( up to a phase ) .",
    "when @xmath42 , we have @xmath85 and thus the entropy @xmath86 . in this case the wave function of the system is @xmath87 that is , the atom is in its ground state and the field is in a pure state , which is known as a kerr state @xcite @xmath88 when the atom is detected in its ground state , the cavity field will be in the kerr state .    when @xmath45 and @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where we have used the following fact for large photon number @xmath92 the entropy is then @xmath93 ( the exact numerical result is 0.69314 , see fig.3 ) .",
    "this means that the cavity field is in a mixed state .",
    "however , at a slightly earlier or later time @xmath94 , the entropy is dramatically reduced to a minimum , as can be seen in fig.2 and fig.3 . for the specific choice @xmath95",
    "we obtain @xmath96 where we have used the relation @xmath97 for large photon number @xmath23 . in this case",
    "we can see that the entropy is approximately zero .",
    "in fact , at @xmath94 , using ( [ omegad ] ) we obtain the following factorized state ( writing @xmath98 ) @xmath99 \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\otimes      \\left ( e^{4i\\phi}|e\\rangle + i|g\\rangle\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we see that the cavity field is a macroscopic superposition of two kerr states @xmath100    the photon number distribution can be derived from the above wave function . here",
    "we write down the pnd directly from ( [ pndexact ] ) and ( [ omegad ] ) @xmath101.\\ ] ] in fig.4 we compare this approximate result with the numerical result .",
    "we see that the agreement is good .",
    "we now show that the entropy is approximately vanishing . using @xmath102 in ( [ pnddelta1 ] )",
    "we find @xmath103      \\equiv 2\\rho_{11},\\ ] ] from which we have @xmath104 .",
    "> from ( [ omegad ] ) we have @xmath105 so the entropy @xmath106 , as expected .",
    "the quasi - probability distribution q - function is defined as @xcite : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the reduced density operator of the cavity field given in eq.([pndexact ] ) and @xmath109 is a coherent state . inserting eq.([pndexact ] ) into eq.([qfuncdef ] ) we can easily obtain the q - function of the cavity field @xmath110    when @xmath51 and @xmath38 , the cavity field is in a coherent state and its q - function is poissonian , as can be seen from fig.5 . at @xmath42 ,",
    "the q - function has two components . at @xmath52 ,",
    "the q - function has 8 components , and the field is in a mixed state ( its entropy is 0.6888 ) .",
    "so the interference between components results in _ imperfect _ oscillation of the pnd .",
    "when @xmath45 the q - function is composed of 4 well - separated components , the entropy reaches its maximum and the field is in a mixed state . in a short time",
    "@xmath111 , the field is nearly pure and the q - function separates into 8 components , the interference between which resulting in strong oscillation of the pnd , as can be seen from fig.(4 ) .",
    "however , at @xmath112 and @xmath113 the cavity field is less pure and the q - function has less well - separated components , and the oscillation of the pnd is less marked ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "finally , we briefly describe the atomic population inversion ( api ) , given by @xmath114 in the one or two photon cases this exhibits the usual periodic collapse and revival phenomenon .",
    "the 4-photon system also shows this behaviour . in fig.6",
    "we give a plot of the api @xmath115 for @xmath78 , from which one can see that the api for the 4-photon system also exhibits periodic collapse and revival .",
    "however , due to the nonlinearity of the system , this effect does not last as long as in the one or two photon cases .",
    "in this paper we studied the four - photon jc model and its dynamical behaviour . in the large photon number approximation ,",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath20 depends quadratically on @xmath9 and this leads to nonlinear effects in the cavity .    by examining the entropy of the field or atom we found that the system is approximately disentangled at certain times . in this case",
    "both the atom and cavity field are in a pure state and those pure states are explicitly given .",
    "it is interesting that the cavity field exists in both a nonlinear kerr state and a macroscopic superposition of kerr states , analogous to the coherent state and the schrdinger cat states in the one or two photon jc model .",
    "one may refer to this analogous kerr superposition as a kerr cat state .",
    "we analysed the pnd in the large photon number approximation . at certain times",
    "the pnd exhibits strong oscillation . from the q - function we know that the cavity field at those times has eight components ; it is the interference between those components which causes the strong oscillation of the pnd .",
    "note that these oscillations depend more sensitively on the interaction time than in the one or two photon cases due to the quadratic dependence of the generalized rabi frequency on photon number in the present work .",
    "we also considered atomic number inversion and found that the phenomenon of periodic collapse and revival occurs ; it is however a short - lived phenomenon due to the effects of nonlinearity .",
    "experimental implementation of the theoretical idea herein proposed would possibly depend on the use of a trapped neutral atom or ion in a high - q cavity , or an atomic beam in transit through the cavity @xcite . in any realistic scheme",
    "off - resonant effects must be taken into account , and for this reason the atomic species used must provide a good approximation to a two - level system .",
    "we are grateful to dr.andrew greentree for useful discussion and comment , especially with regard to the possible experimental realisation of the scheme proposed here .",
