    "considerable efforts have been made during the last years to empirically confirm the theoretical expectation that the main part of the galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) originates in supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "theoretically progress in the solution of this problem has been due to the development of the theory of diffusive shock acceleration ( see , for example , reviews by drury 1983 ; blandford & eichler 1987 ; berezhko & krymsky 1988 ) .",
    "although still incomplete , the theory is able to explain the main characteristics of the observed cr spectrum under several reasonable assumptions , at least up to an energy of @xmath12  ev .",
    "direct information about the dominant nucleonic cr component in snrs can only be vobtained from @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "if this nuclear component is strongly enhanced inside snrs then through inelastic nuclear collisions , leading to pion production and subsequent decay , @xmath0-rays will be produced .",
    "cr acceleration in snrs expanding in a uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) ( drury et al .",
    "1989 ; markiewicz et al . 1990 ; dorfi 1990 ) , and the properties of the associated @xmath0-ray emission ( dorfi 1991 ; drury et al .",
    "1994 ) were investigated in a number of studies ( we mention here only those papers which include the effects of shock geometry and time - dependent nonlinear cr backreaction ; for a review of others which deal with the test particle approximation , see for example drury 1983 ; blandford & eichler 1987 ; berezhko & krymsky 1988 ; vlk 1997 ) .",
    "all of these studies are based on a two - fluid hydrodynamical approach and directly employ the assumption that the expanding sn shock is locally plane ; as dynamic variables for the crs the pressure and the energy density are determined .",
    "their characteristics are sometimes essentially different from the results obtained in a kinetic approach ( kang & jones 1991 ; berezhko et al . 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) which consistently takes the role of shock geometry and nonlinear cr backreaction into account .",
    "first of all , in kinetic theory the form of the spectrum of accelerated crs and their maximum energy are calculated selfconsistently .",
    "in particular , the maximum particle energy @xmath13 , achieved at any given evolutionary stage , is determined by geometrical factors ( berezhko 1996 ) , in contrast to the hydrodynamic models which in fact postulate that the value of @xmath14 is determined by the time interval @xmath15 that has passed since the explosion ( drury et al . 1989 ; markiewicz et al .",
    "1990 ; dorfi 1990 ; jones & kang 1992 ) .",
    "although the difference between the values of @xmath13 in the two cases is not very large , it critically influences the structure and evolution of the shock .",
    "for example , the shock never becomes completely modified ( smoothed ) by the cr backreaction ( kang & jones 1991 ; berezhko et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) . together with the smooth precursor",
    ", the shock transition always contains a relatively strong subshock which heats the swept - up gas and leads to the injection of suprathermal gas particles into the acceleration process . in this sense diffusive shock acceleration",
    "is somewhat less efficient than predicted by hydrodynamic models .",
    "acceleration always requires some freshly injected particles which are generated during gas heating .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with the observations that show significant gas heating in young snrs .",
    "on the other hand , the shock modification by the cr backreaction is even greater than predicted by hydrodynamic models . the total shock compression ratio @xmath16 ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) is a monotonically rising function of the shock mach number @xmath17 and can significantly exceed the classical value 4 , or even the value @xmath18 that corresponds to a postshock medium dominated by relativistic crs .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the fact that cr acceleration at the front of a spherically expanding shock is accompanied by a temporally increasing dilution of shock energy in the form of crs in the precursor region ( drury et al .",
    "1995 ; berezhko 1996 ) .",
    "qualitatively this leads to the same effect as if energetic particles or thermal gas energy were radiated away from the shock ( berezhko 1996 ; berezhko & ellison 1999 ) .",
    "we note that this energy dilution effect is much stronger than the effect of a decreasing specific heat ratio due to the conversion of shock energy into relativistic crs .    the additional gas heating in the precursor region due to alfvn wave dissipation significantly restricts the shock compression ratio @xmath19 even though its value still considerably exceeds 4 for a strong shock ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ; berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .",
    "the precursor gas heating has a much less pronounced effect in the hydrodynamic description ( e.g. dorfi 1990 ) .",
    "as far as the expected @xmath0-ray emission , produced in snrs by the nuclear cr component , is concerned , there are less significant differences between the kinetic ( berezhko & vlk 1997 ) and the hydrodynamic ( dorfi 1991 ; drury et al .",
    "1994 ) predictions , even though these differences are not unimportant .",
    "the reason is that the peak value of the @xmath0-ray flux is mainly determined by the fraction of overall hydrodynamic explosion energy that is transferred to crs , i.e. by the overall efficiency of cr acceleration which is not strongly dependent on the model used .",
    "the differences in the time variation of the predicted @xmath0-ray fluxes are more essential . kinetic theory ( berezhko & vlk 1997 ) revealed much more effective cr and @xmath0-ray production during the free expansion phase .",
    "it also shows a more rapid decrease of the @xmath0-ray flux during the subsequent sedov phase after reaching its peak value , due to the different spatial distributions of thermal gas and crs inside snrs .",
    "this energy - dependent lack of overlap is not taken into account in hydrodynamic models .",
    "the model developed by ellison and co - workers to describe diffusive shock acceleration of crs and to predict the expected @xmath0-ray emission from snrs , uses a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of pitch angle scattering .",
    "it is applied in the same way to all particles , both cr and thermal particles , and is correspondingly solved numerically from the outset ( e.g. ellison et al . 1995 ; baring et al .",
    "the energetic particle population ( i.e. accelerated crs ) naturally arises in this approach as a high energy tail of the distribution of gas particles which undergo heating in the strongest gradient of the selfconsistently modified shock transition , the subshock in our notation . in this way",
    "the model incorporates not only selfconsistent cr acceleration but also gas heating and particle injection into the acceleration process . since it is a plane - wave steady state model it includes as a free parameter the value of the cr cutoff energy @xmath13 , which can not be calculated in this kind of model . on the other hand , at sufficiently high particle energies",
    "the description corresponds to a diffusive approach based on the diffusive transport equation .",
    "therefore our time - dependent kinetic description in spherical symmetry , with an injection rate that corresponds to the mc - model , and the mc - model , in turn incorporating the same value of cr cutoff energy , give identical cr spectra at any stage of the free expansion phase for the same set of ism and shock parameters ( berezhko & ellison 2000 ) .",
    "this means that in its free expansion phase the snr evolution can be represented as a sequence of quasi - stationary states ; each of them can be reproduced in the framework of the plane - wave steady state description with the corresponding value of the cr cutoff energy @xmath14 .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated in the subsequent sedov phase due to the existence of a so - called escaping particle population near the shock front ( berezhko & ellison 1999b ) , which is a purely nonstationary phenomenon ( berezhko 1986a ; berezhko & krymsky 1988 ) and therefore can not be reproduced in the framework of a steady state approach .",
    "as far as the overall cr spectrum and the associated @xmath0-ray flux at any given evolutionary phase are concerned , the plane wave description can only give an approximate estimate because it does not include such important physical factors as cr adiabatic cooling and the incomplete overlap of the spatial distributions of gas and crs inside the expanding snr .",
    "the evolution of snrs in a uniform ism is typical only for sne type ia .",
    "sne of type ib and ii , which are more numerous in our galaxy , explode into an inhomogeneous circumstellar medium , formed by the intensive wind of their massive progenitor stars ( losinskaya 1991 ) .",
    "this is at least true for progenitor masses @xmath20 whose main sequence winds are very energetic .",
    "their time - integrated hydrodynamic energy output is so large that they create wind cavities which are about as large as the size of a remnant of the subsequent supernova explosion , if it would occur in a uniform ism of the same density .",
    "the more frequent lower mass core collapse progenitors ( @xmath21 ) have at least a massive red supergiant wind region before the transition to the external ism",
    ". therefore the description of snr evolution and cr acceleration becomes considerably more difficult for those cases . due to the complicated structure of the medium",
    "one can expect that the difference between kinetic and hydrodynamic model predictions will be even more pronounced than in the case of a uniform ism .",
    "up to now , except for the paper by berezhko & vlk ( 1995 ) where preliminary results of the present work were presented , the consideration of cr acceleration in the case of a sn type ib and sn type ii was considered only for sn shock propagation through the region of the supersonic stellar wind ( berezinskii & ptuskin 1988 ; vlk & biermann 1988 ; jones & kang 1992 ; kirk et al .",
    "1995 ) . since this region is characterized by an initially very strong if spatially decreasing magnetic field of stellar origin and a very high shock speed , the maximum energy of crs accelerated in the wind region is achieved extremely rapidly during a period of time comparable with the snr age at each phase , and then it remains nearly constant due to a balance of acceleration gains and adiabatic losses ( vlk & biermann 1988 ) . as it is shown below , the expected cr energy spectrum is close to being selfsimilar where the amplitude monotonically decreases with time but the shape remains invariant ( see appendix ) .",
    "thus the situation is very different from that for a uniform circumstellar medium with a standard magnitude ism field strength , where the maximum cr energy is only achieved at the end of the sweep - up phase , after hundreds or even thousands of years .",
    "the direct dependence on the stellar surface field also raised hopes that the cr acceleration in the wind would constitute a major source of the observed galactic crs with energies @xmath22  ev .",
    "the most optimistic assumptions predict cr generation in these regions up to an energy of @xmath23  ev ( biermann 1993 ) . in this context",
    "we would like to make the following remarks :    first of all , the supersonic wind region contains a relatively small amount of mass @xmath24 which is typically smaller than the ejected mass @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the fraction of the sn explosion energy which can be transfered into crs is typically lower than required for the observed cr spectrum , especially in the case of a sn type ib ( see below ) .",
    "second , to achieve a particle energy significantly greater than @xmath4  ev one needs to assume an unusually high magnetic field in the wind .",
    "this tends to violate the condition @xmath26 , necessary for the existence of a supersonic flow in the first place , as pointed out by axford ( 1994 ) , where @xmath27 is the wind speed and @xmath28 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "third , the wind magnetic field is largely azimuthal , except in the very polar region near the stellar rotation axis , and the outer snr shock is almost perpendicular .",
    "therefore not only the suprathermal ion injection is much less efficient but also the cr acceleration itself appears not so efficient as in the case of a quasi - parallel shock . although one can give some physical arguments which assert that particle injection with their subsequent acceleration takes place also in this case , one needs a more rigorous treatment of this complex question .",
    "an example for the acceleration at a shock propagating through a stationary stochastic large yyscale magnetic field that is on average perpendicular to the shock normal is given by kirk et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the process of anomalous diffusion ( see chuvilgin & ptuskin 1993 ) .",
    "this test particle calculation indicates , as intuitively expected , that the spectrum of accelerated particles is steeper than for acceleration at a quasi - parallel shock . as a consequence ,",
    "the nonlinear efficiency of acceleration would also have to be assumed to be significantly reduced .",
    "fourth , the unusually high maximum cr energy predicted by biermann ( 1993 ) is a direct consequence of the assumption of a very small and energy independent cr diffusion coefficient , presumably produced by the chaotic turbulent motions of the medium near the shock , that formally gives very fast acceleration to extremely high energies . leaving aside the important question concerning the justification of the assumption for such shock - produced turbulent motions also significantly ahead of the forward snr shock itself ( see e.g. ellison et al .",
    "1994 , lucek & bell 2000 ) , one has to stress that the final result should in any case depend upon the values of the microscopic cr diffusion tensor which alone allows crs to intersect the shock front many times with a subsequent increase of their energy .",
    "as far as the macroscopic cr diffusion due to chaotic gas motions ( biermann 1993 ) is concerned , it can not itself provide cr acceleration .",
    "in fact , from what has been said before , even our results presented below , based on the usual assumption about bohm type microscopic particle diffusion in a quasi - parallel shock and much less optimistic compared with those in biermann ( 1993 ) , must be considered as an upper limit for the cr energy density which can be achieved during shock acceleration .",
    "this leaves open the question whether the evolving snr shock system can generate a strong scattering wave field and allows the assumption of a favorable ratio of the microscopic parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients over a sufficiently long time , so that the maximum individual particle energy can be increased by something like an order of magnitude or more for a perpendicular shock ( jokipii 1987 ; ostrowski 1988 ; ellison et al .",
    "1995 ; reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , a strong wind modifies the environment of massive progenitors of sn types ib and ii .",
    "it sweeps up the ambient gas into a thin shell surrounding a rarefied bubble ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ; losinskaya 1991 ) .",
    "since the typical cavity is greater than @xmath29  pc in size and contains a considerable amount of matter , it can significantly influence the snr evolution and cr acceleration .",
    "estimates and preliminary numerical calculations indicate that the sn shock propagation through the progenitor s wind region should generate high - energy @xmath5-decay @xmath0-ray emission on a detectable level ( berezinsky & ptuskin 1988 ; kirk et al .",
    "1995 ; berezhko & vlk 1995-ray fluxes in the wind snr cases were plotted with an enlargement factor of 2500 which should be left out ] ) . yet , up to now , all _ detailed _ numerical investigations of cr acceleration in snrs have dealt with the case of a star exploding into a uniform homogeneous medium .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed extension of the kinetic model for cr acceleration in snrs ( berezhko et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; berezhko & vlk 1997 ) to the case of a nonuniform circumstellar medium , spherical symmetry still being assumed .",
    "we study the cr acceleration and @xmath5-decay @xmath0-ray production taking into account that the circumstellar medium can be strongly modified by a wind from the progenitor star . in doing this",
    "we assume energetic particle scattering governed by the bohm diffusion coefficient in the local mean magnetic field , treating the shock normal to be quasi - parallel to the field direction .",
    "we have studied two cases typical for type ib and type ii sne . in the first case , a star with an initial mass of @xmath30 at the end of its evolution explodes as sn into the cavity created by a main - sequence ( ms ) o - star wind and the subsequent winds during the red supergiant ( rsg ) and wolf - rayet ( wr ) phases . for the case of a sn type ii",
    "we take the example of the explosion of a star with initial mass @xmath31 into the cavity created by the winds emitted during the ms and rsg phases . in both cases",
    "we consider the two different interstellar number densities 0.3 and 30 @xmath7 .",
    "we shall not address here the question of @xmath0-ray production by electron synchrotron emission , bremsstrahlung , or the inverse compton ( ic ) effect on ambient low energy photons . especially at very high energies exceeding @xmath32  gev ,",
    "ic @xmath0-rays appear to dominate the emission from plerions like the crab nebula ( e.g. de jager & harding 1992 , atoyan & aharonian 1996 ) , where presumably a relativistic wind of electron - positron pairs from the pulsar is dissipated in a circumstellar termination shock deep inside the snr shell . the ic effect associated with acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons inside the snr shell , or at its leading shock ( along with ions considered here ) , may also contribute quantitatively to the @xmath0-ray luminosity of a snr as simple estimates suggest ( mastichiadis 1996 ; mastichiadis & de jager 1996 ) .",
    "therefore in any specific source this leptonic contribution to the @xmath0-ray flux needs to be estimated before the hadronic @xmath5-decay @xmath0-ray emission can be compared with the theoretical models presented below .",
    "we briefly describe some aspects of the model in sect .",
    "2 since it was in detail described in a previous paper ( berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .",
    "3 contains the results and sect .",
    "4 includes the discussion and the conclusions .",
    "during the early phase of snr evolution the hydrodynamical sn explosion energy @xmath33 is kinetic energy of the expanding shell of ejected mass .",
    "the motion of these ejecta produces a strong shock wave in the background medium , whose size @xmath34 increases with velocity @xmath35 .",
    "diffusive propagation of energetic particles in the collisionless scattering medium allows them to traverse the shock front many times .",
    "each two subsequent shock crossings increase the particle energy . in plane geometry",
    "this diffusive shock acceleration process ( krymsky 1977 ; axford et al .",
    "1977 ; bell 1978 ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) creates a power law - type cr momentum spectrum . due to their large energy content",
    "the crs can dynamically modify the shock structure .",
    "the description of cr acceleration by a spherical snr shock wave is based on the diffusive transport equation for the cr distribution function @xmath36 ( krymsky 1964 ; parker 1965 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the source term due to injection ; @xmath39 , @xmath15 and @xmath40 denote the radial coordinate , the time , and particle momentum , respectively ; @xmath41 is the cr diffusion coefficient ; @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radial mechanical velocity of the scattering medium ( i.e. thermal gas ) , @xmath28 is the speed of forward alfvn waves generated in the upstream region by the anisotropy of the accelerating crs . in the downstream plasma",
    "the propagation directions of the scattering waves are assumed to be isotropized ( e.g. drury et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the thermal matter is described by the gas dynamic equations @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the mass density , specific heat ratio and the pressure of gas , respectively , and @xmath51 is the cr pressure .",
    "these gas dynamic equations include the cr backreaction via term @xmath52 .",
    "they also describe the gas heating due to the dissipation of alfvn waves in the upstream region ( mckenzie & vlk 1982 ; vlk et al .",
    "1984 ) ; it is given by the parameter @xmath53 at @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "we expect that the snr shock always includes a sufficiently strong subshock which heats the gas and plays an important dynamical role , also in the present case of nonuniform background medium .",
    "the gas subshock , situated at @xmath57 , is treated as a discontinuity on which all hydrodynamical quantities undergo a jump .    we assume , that the injection of some ( small ) fraction of gas particles into the acceleration process takes place at the subshock , that is described by the source @xmath58    for the sake of simplicity we restrict our consideration to protons , which are the dominant ions in the cosmic plasma . at present",
    "we only have some experimental ( e.g. lee 1982 ; trattner et al . 1994 ) and theoretical ( quest 1988 ; trattner & scholer 1991 ; giacalone et al . 1993 ; bennett & ellison 1995 ; malkov & vlk 1995 , 1996 ) indications as to what value of the injection rate can be expected .",
    "we use here a simple cr injection model , in which a small fraction @xmath59 of the incoming protons is instantly injected at the gas subshock with a speed @xmath60 times the postshock gas sound speed @xmath61 ( berezhko et al . 1990 ; kang & jones 1991 ; berezhko et al . 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ;",
    "berezhko & vlk 1997 ) :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the proton number density , and @xmath64 is the particle ( proton ) mass . for simplicity , we always use @xmath65 . the subscripts 1(2 )",
    "refer to the point just ahead ( behind ) the subshock .",
    "we assume that the bohm diffusion coefficient is a good approximation for strong shocks ( mckenzie & vlk 1982 ) , characterized by strong wave generation ( bell 1978 ) .",
    "this latter question has been studied very recently in its nonlinear consequences , by lucek & bell ( 2000 ) numerically , and by bell & lucek ( 2000 ) using an analytical model .",
    "the conclusion is that wave generation in very strong shocks should not only lead to bohm diffusion , but also to an amplification of the pre - shock magnetic field that increases the acceleration rate , as had been speculated earlier ( vlk 1984 ) .",
    "we use here the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the gyroradius of a particle with momentum @xmath40 in the magnetic field @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the speed of light .",
    "this coefficient differs from the bohm diffusion coefficient in the non - relativistic energy region , but this difference is absolutely unimportant because of the very high acceleration rate at @xmath70 . in the disturbed region",
    "we use @xmath71 , where the subscript @xmath72 corresponds to the current shock position @xmath57 .",
    "an additional factor @xmath73 was assumed to prevent the instability of the precursor ( drury 1984 ; berezhko 1986b ) .",
    "it can also be interpreted as describing the enhancement of magnetic turbulence in a region of higher gas density .",
    "alfvn wave dissipation ( vlk et al . 1984 ) as an additional heating mechanism strongly influences the structure of a modified shock in the case of large sonic mach number @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the alfvnic mach number , @xmath76 and @xmath28 are the local sound and alfvn speeds correspondingly , at the shock front position @xmath57 .",
    "the wave damping substantially restricts the growth of the shock compression ratio @xmath77 at the level @xmath78 which , in the absence of alfvn wave dissipation , has been found to reach extremely high values @xmath79 for large mach numbers ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ; berezhko & ellison 1999 ) .",
    "the dynamic equations are solved under the initial ( @xmath80 ) conditions : @xmath81 @xmath82 which neglect the background crs and describe some ambient gas distribution modified by the wind from the progenitor star emitted during a preceding time period @xmath83 .",
    "the time @xmath84 corresponds to the instant of sn explosion .",
    "the result of a core collapse supernova , many days after the explosion , is freely expanding gas with velocity @xmath85 . the density profile of the ejecta",
    "is described by ( jones et al .",
    "1981 ; chevalier 1982 ; chevalier & liang 1989 ) @xmath86 where @xmath87^{5/2 } } { [ 10(k-5)e_{sn}]^{3/2 } } , ~~v_t=\\left[\\frac{10(k-5)e_{sn } } { 3(k-3)m_{ej}}\\right]^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath88 is the total ejected mass . for snrs",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath89 typically lies between 7 and 12 .",
    "the pressure in the expanding ejecta is negligible .",
    "interaction with the ambient material modifies the ejecta density distribution .",
    "we describe the ejecta dynamics in a simplified manner , assuming that the modified ejecta consist of two parts ( berezhko & vlk 1997 ) : a thin shell ( or piston ) moving with some speed @xmath90 and a freely expanding part which is described by the distribution ( 9 ) .",
    "the piston includes the decelerated tail of the distribution ( 9 ) with initial velocities @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the piston radius separating the ejecta and the swept - up ism matter .",
    "the evolution of the piston is described in the framework of a simplified thin - shell approximation , in which the thickness of the shell is neglected . behind the piston @xmath93",
    ", the cr distribution is assumed to be uniform .",
    "the high velocity tail in the distribution ( 9 ) ensures a large value of the snr shock speed at an early phase of evolution .",
    "it increases the cr and @xmath0-ray production significantly compared with the case where all the ejecta propagate with a single velocity ( berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .    in the case of a uniform ism",
    "it was shown that the cr penetration through the piston plays no important role for sn shock evolution and overall cr production ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the case of an intensive wind from the progenitor star",
    ", a relatively large volume around the progenitor is occupied by a low density bubble .",
    "the main amount of crs and @xmath0-rays are produced when the snr shock interacts with this bubble .",
    "piston and shock sizes are comparable and much larger than the dynamic scale of the system during the most effective cr production phase",
    ". therefore one can expect that cr penetration through the piston is more important in comparison with the case of a uniform ism .",
    "the efficiency of diffusive cr penetration through the piston depends on the magnetic field structure , which is influenced by the rayleigh - taylor instability at the contact discontinuity ( @xmath94 ) between the ejecta and the swept up medium that is contained in the region @xmath95 . according to chevalier s ( 1982 ) estimate , the energy density of the turbulent motions created by this instability is determined by the value of the thermal pressure @xmath96 at the outer piston surface @xmath97 , and may be as large as @xmath98 .",
    "turbulent motions in the ionized medium lead to the amplification of magnetic fields .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field grows up to the energy density @xmath99 .",
    "this turbulent magnetic field is presumably distributed over a wide range of length scales .",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field fluctuations which resonantly interact with particles in the momentum range from @xmath100 to @xmath101 may be as large as @xmath102 , which is about @xmath103 for a typical cr cutoff momentum @xmath104 .",
    "therefore we use a bohm type diffusion coefficient in the piston region , corresponding to a magnetic field strength of @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "radiative gas cooling is not included in our model .",
    "this process becomes important at the late sedov phase ( dorfi 1991 ) , when cr acceleration becomes inefficient .",
    "detailed descriptions of the model and of the numerical methods have been given earlier ( berezhko et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .",
    "the strong wind from the massive progenitor star interacts with an ambient ism of uniform density @xmath107 , resulting to first approximation in an expanding spherical configuration , which is called a bubble ( weaver et al .",

    "they are : ( a ) the hypersonic stellar wind ( b ) a region of shocked stellar wind ( c ) a shell of shocked interstellar gas , and ( d ) the ambient ism .",
    "we consider here the case of a so - called modified bubble whose structure is significantly influenced by mass transport from the dense and relatively cold shell ( c ) into the hot region ( b ) , and by thermal conduction in the opposite direction , these two energy fluxes balancing each other to first order . during this stage",

    "ultimately , some particles might indeed reach the maximum energy , which is determined by the usual physical factors for a quasi - parallel shock ( see below ) .",
    "however the particle spectrum is expected to be softer than for a quasi - parallel shock . for the suprathermal particles with energy @xmath181 the diffusive length is about @xmath182 .",

    "@xmath9s@xmath10 , reached at @xmath346  yr , would be the peak flux for a uniform medium with number density @xmath347 .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , the @xmath0-ray flux continues to increase for @xmath348  yr because at this period the sn shock enters the region ( c ) , where the gas density starts to increase rapidly ( see fig .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "3 that the @xmath0-ray flux reaches the value @xmath349",
    "@xmath9s@xmath10 at @xmath350  yr .",
    "a comparison with the previous case shows that this peak flux scales as @xmath108 as in the case of a uniform ism ( e.g. berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .",
    "however , it is essentially lower ( at least by a factor of 100 ) than in the case where the ism is uniform with the same density @xmath108 .",
    "the main reason of this low efficiency of @xmath0-ray production is that in the case under discussion the majority of crs is produced in the low density bubble . when the sn shock enters the high density shell region ( c ) it becomes weak and therefore an inefficient cr accelerator . in this phase , in comparison with the case of a uniform ism , the same amount of crs mainly produced at previous evolutionary phases generates a much lower @xmath0-ray flux because of the poor spatial overlap between the cr and gas distributions ( see berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .",
    "the peak of the gas density distribution lies just behind the shock front , whereas the crs are sitting deeper inside where the density of the gas is much lower .",
    "we model the type ii sn case as a progenitor star with initial mass @xmath351 ( e.g. leitherer et al .",
    "1992 ) that spends a time period @xmath352  yr on the main - sequence with a mass - loss rate @xmath353  yr@xmath10 and wind velocity @xmath151  km / s , and then the time @xmath354  yr in the rsg phase with mass - loss rate @xmath355  yr@xmath10 and wind velocity @xmath154  km / s . the ms wind creates a bubble of size @xmath356  pc in the ism with @xmath357  @xmath7 . according to eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) the bubble is characterized by @xmath358  @xmath7 and @xmath359  dyne/@xmath160 .",
    "the rsg wind occupies the region of size @xmath360  pc . at this point",
    "the ram pressure @xmath361 of rsg wind exceeds the thermal pressure @xmath362 in the bubble .",
    "therefore we neglect the shell which can be formed in the rsg wind due to its interaction with the ambient bubble material .",
    "we model the transition zone between the rsg wind and the bubble by the set of parameters @xmath363 , @xmath364 .",
    "we introduce this zone to match smoothly the gas densities @xmath171 between regions ( a ) and ( b ) , see fig .",
    "1 . it contains a small amount of gas and plays no role in the overall snr evolution .",
    "we use a magnetic field strength @xmath365  g in the rsg wind at the distance @xmath366  cm .",
    "it formally correspond to @xmath367  g , @xmath368  cm and @xmath369 .",
    "our b - field is about 60 times smaller than that assumed by vlk & biermann ( 1988 ) .",
    "their magnetic field implies an alfvn velocity @xmath370 which is considerably larger than the wind speed @xmath27 .",
    "this renders the existence of the rsg mass outflow as a supersonic wind problematic ( axford 1994 ) . in our case",
    "the rsg wind is superalfvnic with @xmath371 . it might be possible to model a slow outflow starting with a much higher stellar magnetic field which is then subalfvnic",
    "however , we shall not attempt such a dynamical construction in this paper .",
    "we start the computation of the snr evolution with the initial conditions @xmath372  yr , @xmath373  cm , @xmath374  km / s .",
    "5 illustrates sn shock evolution , cr and @xmath0-ray production for an ism with @xmath335  @xmath7 .",
    "the character of the cr spectrum @xmath375 , shown in fig .",
    "5a , and of the overall cr spectrum @xmath328 , plotted in fig .",
    "5c , are similar to the previous case of the sn ib for @xmath258  yr when the sn shock propagates through the region ( a ) of the supersonic wind .",
    "the value of the cutoff momentum @xmath376  mc is consistent with formula ( 28 ) .",
    "the acceleration efficiency and the corresponding shock modification are very high . during the initial stage @xmath377  yr",
    "the shock compression ratio reaches the value @xmath378 and then slowly decreases due to the shock deceleration ( see fig .",
    "5b ) . as a consequence",
    "the high energy part of the cr spectrum is extremely hard @xmath379 at @xmath380 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath0-ray spectrum @xmath381 ( fig .",
    "5e ) is much steeper at @xmath382  ev than the integral cr spectrum : the crs in the upstream region @xmath54 , which make the integral cr spectrum extremely hard , play a much less important role in the formation of the @xmath0-ray spectrum , because they occupy a relatively lower density region .    in the present case",
    "the @xmath0-ray generation within the ejecta is negligible .",
    "therefore , according to relation ( 30 ) , the expected @xmath0-ray flux @xmath256(1 tev ) should be about @xmath383 times larger than the flux @xmath260(1 tev ) in the case of the wr wind .",
    "one can see from fig.3 and fig.5e , that the calculated @xmath0-ray flux can be represented in the form ( 31 ) with @xmath384@xmath9s@xmath10 in agreement with relation ( 30 ) .    during these initial 500 years",
    "the sn shock sweeps up @xmath385 , crs absorb about 10% of the explosion energy ( see fig .",
    "5f ) and the expected @xmath0-ray flux @xmath256(1 tev ) exceeds the value @xmath386",
    "@xmath9s@xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    during the period @xmath387  yr the sn shock propagates through the intermediate zone ( see fig .",
    "5d ) which contains only a small amount of matter .",
    "the cr energy content slowly increases , but the cr spectrum becomes progressively steeper . together with the decrease of the gas density this leads to a decrease of the @xmath0-ray flux @xmath388 ( see fig.3 ) .    for @xmath389",
    "yr the sn shock propagates through the bubble whose characteristics are similar to the bubble around the progenitor of a type ib sn , in an ism with the same density @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore at this stage the expected @xmath0-ray production continues to decrease up to the time @xmath390  yr , when the @xmath0-ray production by crs accelerated during previous stages drops to a level that corresponds to a flux @xmath391  @xmath9s@xmath10 typical for a uniform medium with @xmath347 . for @xmath392  yr @xmath0-rays produced in the bubble material start to dominate and the @xmath0-ray flux increases with time . at @xmath393  yr the sn shock reaches the shell region ( c )",
    "where the density increases .",
    "therefore the expected @xmath0-ray flux increases more rapidly for @xmath325  yr ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , even though the cr production becomes quite low in this phase ( see fig .",
    "more than 40% of the explosion energy goes into crs during the full snr evolution .    in fig .",
    "3 we present also the calculated @xmath0-ray flux @xmath256(1 tev ) for the case @xmath357  @xmath7 .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath256(1 tev ) for @xmath394  yr is identical to the previous case . for @xmath395  yr the sn shock propagates through the bubble whose characteristics are now similar to the case of a type ib snr with @xmath357  @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the expected @xmath0-ray production during late phases @xmath325  yr is close to that case ( see fig .",
    "our numerical results show that when a sn explodes into a circumstellar medium strongly modified by a wind from a massive progenitor star , then crs are accelerated in the snr almost as effectively as in the case of a uniform ism ( berezhko et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; berezhko & vlk 1997 ) : about @xmath396% of the sn explosion energy is transformed into crs during the active snr evolution .    during sn shock propagation in the supersonic wind region",
    "very soon the acceleration process reaches a quasi - stationary level which is characterized by a high efficiency and a correspondingly large shock modification . despite the fact that the shock modification is much stronger than predicted by a two - fluid hydrodynamical model ( jones & kang 1992 ) , the shock never becomes completely smoothed by cr backreaction : a relatively strong subshock always exists and plays an important dynamical role . as in the case of a uniform ism , the spurious complete shock smoothing in hydrodynamic models is the result of an underestimate of the role of geometric factors .    due to",
    "the relatively small mass contained in the supersonic wind region crs absorb there only a small fraction of the explosion energy ( about 1% in the case of a sn type ib , and 10% in the case of a sn type ii ) and the snr is still very far from the sedov phase after having swept up this region .",
    "therefore we conclude , that the crs produced in this region should not play a very significant role for the formation of the observed galactic cr energy spectrum .",
    "the peak value of the cr energy content in the snr is reached when the sn shock sweeps up an amount of mass roughly equal to several times the ejected mass .",
    "this takes place during the sn shock propagation in the modified bubble . in a purely adiabatic bubble",
    "the sweep - up would occur at the beginning of the shell . compared with the uniform ism case",
    "the subsequent adiabatic cr deceleration is less important in the case of a modified circumstellar medium .",
    "the main amount of crs in this case is produced when the sn shock propagates through the bubble . in this stage",
    "the dynamical scale length is much smaller than the shock size .",
    "therefore the relative increase of the shock radius during the late evolution stage and the corresponding adiabatic effects are small .",
    "these configurational properties lead to potentially interesting changes of the cr chemical composition with particle energy ( see sect .",
    "3.1 )    in the case of the modified circumstellar medium the cr and @xmath0-ray spectra are more variable during the sn shock evolution than in the case of a uniform ism ( berezhko & vlk 1997 ) . at the same time",
    "the form of the resulting overall cr spectrum is rather insensitive to the parameters of the ism as in the case of uniform ism .",
    "the reason is that the main amount of crs are produced in the latest phase which has still a strong enough shock . roughly speaking",
    ", the overall cr spectrum ( except the most energetic crs ) is mainly formed at the stage when the shock compression ratio lies between 4 and 5 .",
    "the maximum energy of the accelerated crs reached during the snr evolution is about @xmath4  ev for protons in all the cases considered .",
    "our results confirm the important conclusion , reached for the case of a uniform ism before , that the diffusive acceleration of crs in snrs is able to generate the observed cr spectrum up to an energy @xmath397  ev , if the cr diffusion coefficient is as small as bohm limit .",
    "this disregards the possibility of turbulent field amplification , as discussed in sect .",
    "2 .    in the case of a sn ib the expected tev - energy @xmath0-ray flux ,",
    "normalized to a distance of 1 kpc , remains lower than @xmath334  @xmath9s@xmath10 during the entire snr evolution if the ism number density is less than 1  @xmath7 except for an initial short period @xmath281  yr when it is about @xmath8  @xmath9s@xmath10 . only for a relatively dense ism with @xmath335  @xmath7",
    "the expected @xmath0-ray flux is about @xmath386  @xmath9s@xmath10 at late phases @xmath325  yr . a similar situation exists at late phases of snr evolution in the case of sn ii .",
    "it is interesting to note that the expected @xmath0-ray flux is considerably lower , at least by a factor of hundred , compared with the case of uniform ism of the same density @xmath108 .",
    "this confirms the preliminary result reported earlier ( berezhko & vlk 1995 )    the type ii sn explodes into the dense wind of the red supergiant progenitor star . during the first several hundred years @xmath398 after the explosion , the expected tev - energy @xmath0-ray flux at a distance @xmath292  kpc exceeds the value @xmath399",
    "@xmath9s@xmath10 and can be detected up to the distance @xmath400  kpc with present instruments like hegra , whipple or cat .",
    "this distance is of the order of the diameter of the galactic disk ( see also kirk et al .",
    "therefore all galactic snrs of this type whose number is @xmath401 should be visible .",
    "but in this case we can expect at best @xmath402 such @xmath0-ray sources at any given time .",
    "the typical value of the cutoff energy of the expected @xmath0-ray flux is about @xmath403  ev , if the cr diffusion coefficient is as small as the bohm limit . in this respect",

    "et al . 1995 ; allen , n.h .",
    "1995 ) in searching of @xmath0-ray emission from galactic snrs is not surprising because their threshold @xmath404  tev exceeds the cutoff energy of the expected @xmath0-ray flux ; marginally this also holds for the negative results of the lower threshold @xmath405  20 tev airobicc array ( prahl & prosch 1997 ; prosch et al .",

    "one can in part explain this fact by the extremely low @xmath5-decay @xmath0-ray intensity expected from such snrs during the period of sn shock propagation through the low - density hot bubble .",
    "an alternative possibility relates to the assumption of the bohm limit for the cr diffusion coefficient which can be too optimistic , in particular for the quai - perpendicular geometry in wind - blown regions from rotating stars . for a slightly more general discussion of snr @xmath0-rays in stellar wind cavities , see vlk ( 1997 ) .",

    "<S> a kinetic model of particle acceleration in supernova remnants ( snrs ) is extended to study the cosmic ray ( cr ) and associated high - energy @xmath0-ray production during sn shock propagation through the inhomogeneous circumstellar medium of a progenitor star that emits a wind . </S>",
    "<S> the wind forms a low - density bubble surrounded by a swept - up shell of interstellar matter . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-rays are produced as a result of decay of pions which in turn are the result of collisions of crs with nuclei of the thermal plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the snrs is followed numerically , taking into account the nonlinear backreaction of the accelerated crs . </S>",
    "<S> the model for snrs includes injection of suprathermal particles at the shock front and heating of the thermal plasma due to dissipation of alfvn waves in the precursor region . </S>",
    "<S> examples typical for sn type ib and sn type ii explosions are considered . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the confirmation of the known fact that acceleration is extremely rapid and that the upper momentum cutoff is reached almost immediately after the explosion due to the high wind magnetic field , it is also shown that the crs are accelerated with a high efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the circumstellar parameters , 20% to 40% of the sn explosion energy is absorbed by crs during the snr evolution for a moderate injection rate , when a fraction @xmath1 of the gas particles , swept up by the supernova shock , is accelerated . </S>",
    "<S> the cr momentum spectrum , ultimately produced in the snrs , has a power law form @xmath2 with an index @xmath3 to 2.1 in a wide energy range up to a maximum energy , which is about @xmath4  ev , if the cr diffusion coefficient is as small as the bohm limiting value . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be expected that the resulting cr chemical composition at high energies reflects more the stellar wind composition , whereas at lower energies it corresponds more to that of the average interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the expected @xmath5-decay @xmath0-ray flux is however considerably lower than in the case of a uniform interstellar medium ; a relatively high @xmath0-ray luminosity in the band @xmath6  tev , detectable at distances of several kpc , is only expected in the case of a relatively dense ism with a number density above 10  @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> extremely high @xmath0-ray emission may be produced when the sn shock propagates through the slow dense wind of a red supergiant , the progenitor of a sn type ii . in this case </S>",
    "<S> snrs might be visible in @xmath0-rays for several hundred years out to distances of tens of kpc . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of a sn type ib the expected @xmath5-decay @xmath0-ray tev - energy flux during the whole snr evolution remains lower than @xmath8  @xmath9s@xmath10 if the interstellar number density is less than @xmath11  @xmath7 . </S>"
