    "among many absorption features in spectra of cool stars , tio molecular absorptions are be recognized as an indicator of basic stellar parameters mainly in two type of stars , cool pulsating giants and super giants and chromospheric active stars which tio absorption can be used as a starspot indicator @xcite .",
    "the temperature sensitivity of tio bands at near - infrared is so pronounced that these bands have always been used as a primary indicator to divide m stars into their subtypes .",
    "another interesting observed fact is that the tio absorption strength is independent of luminosity class , which is approximately the same for dwarf , giants and supergiants @xcite .",
    "@xcite defined an index by measuring the tio@xmath0 absorption band strength at @xmath1 = 886 nm in m giants , and calibrated it versus temperature by using the relation between spectral type and temperature given by ridgway @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 2 of ramsey , the depth of the tio band at 886 nm is a sensitive temperature indicator for giants in the range @xmath2 k. it is also somewhat useful in the range @xmath3 k. at @xmath4 k , the tio bands become too weak to be useful .",
    "@xcite has invented a tio sensitive index which was proposed to measure the absorption strength of tio molecules at 719 nm .",
    "he showed that this index can distinguish between m super giant sub - types .",
    "@xcite used wing tio - index to measure longitudinal distribution of starspots on the surface of the g8iii star @xmath1 andromeda and have estimated a period of 10 - 15 years for chromospheric activity of this star .    to provide a correct measure of absorption at 719 nm wing has estimated the continuum over this absorption band by extrapolating the continuum in 754 and 1024 which he claimed are mostly free of absorption .",
    "this has made a three filter system which is known as the wing filter system .",
    "one of the major advantages of wing tio - index has been its strong sensitivity to effective temperature for atmospheres cooler than 4000 k. the linear reduction of the index by increasing @xmath5 has made it a temperature index which has been used by several authors including himself .",
    "the possible contamination of other molecular absorptions in continuum regions would make this linear relation inaccurate and misleading .",
    "technological advancements in spectroscopic facilities which provide us with ultra high resolution spectra especially in near infrared have made it possible to better investigate the wing continuum bands and to check if they are contaminated or if it is possible to shift them to represent a more accurate continuum , free of molecular absorbtion .",
    "the basic motivation of this paper is investigating the synthetic and also high resolution observed spectra of a sample of cool giants to find a more precise temperature calibration for cool stars .",
    "+ in this paper , we present an updated tio - index which is proposed to measure absorption strength of tio bands at @xmath1 = 719 nm , by using the high - resolution spectroscopic data from the .",
    "we first search in a grid of synthetic spectra to find a spectral band which closely resembles the continuum .",
    "section 2 describes wing system properties for measuring the tio@xmath1719 nm absorption strength and the definition for tio - index . in section 3 ,",
    "a modified continuum band is selected which we claim is less affected from absorption line contamination .",
    "the stellar sample is described in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents the results , including wing tio - index and our index values for a sample of stars along with their calibration as a function of the effective temperature .",

    "the central wavelengths and full width at half - maximum band - pass at these filters are listed in table [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "the central wavelength of the a filter ( full width at half - maximum is 11 nm ) at 719 nm is one of the strongest absorption bands of tio @xmath0 molecules .",
    "the b filter with central wavelength of 754 nm measures the continuum intensity in the right wing of tio absorption band and the c filter ( full width at half - maximum is 42 nm ) with central wavelength of 1024 nm is located in a continuum region far from a and b.      the strength of the tio absorption at 719 nm is measured by dividing the stellar flux received through filter a to filter b. however , this ratio is slightly sensitive to the slope of the energy distribution of the star .",
    "@xcite has removed this effect by linearly extrapolating the b and c band - passes to the center of a band and by introducing a measure of absorption at a band by a tio index :    @xmath6    where a , b and c are the apparent magnitudes in a , b and c filters . the numerical coefficient of 0.13 is measured by the spacings of the filters in wavelength .",
    "as mentioned earlier , tio - index is a measure of the depth of tio@xmath1719 nm molecular absorption band .",
    "precise measurement of the continuum at a band - pass will give a more accurate absorption strength and by the way a more precise calibration .",
    "we use a set of synthetic spectra to search for more appropriate b and c bands , free from contamination of other absorption features , using kurucz model atmosphere @xcite .    with [ m / h ] = 0 ( i.e. , star abundance ) , @xmath7 g between 3 to 5 , @xmath8 g = 0.5 and effective temperature between 2900 and 4000 k , @xmath9 t = 100 k where tio molecules have significant absorbtion at near - infrared , a number of 60 synthetic spectra were obtained .",
