    "in their pioneering work @xcite , gupta and kumar posed and studied the limits of communication in ad hoc wireless networks . assuming @xmath0 nodes are uniformly distributed in a plane and grouped into source - destination ( s - d ) pairs at random , they showed that one can achieve a sum throughput of @xmath8 .",
    "this is achieved using a multihop transmission scheme in which nodes transmit to one of the nodes in their neighboring cells , requiring full connectivity with at least one node per cell . a trade - off between throughput and delay of fully - connected networks",
    "was studied in @xcite and was extended in @xcite to trade - offs between throughput , delay as well as energy .",
    "the work in @xcite has studied relay networks in which a single source transmits its data to the intended destination using the other nodes as relays . using percolation theory @xcite , they showed that a constant rate is achievable for a single s - d pair if we allow a small fraction of nodes to be disconnected .",
    "this result can be applied to ad hoc networks having multiple s - d pairs and the work in @xcite proposed an indirect multihop routing protocol based on such partial connectivity , that is all s - d pairs perform multihop transmissions based on this partially - connected sub - network .",
    "they showed that the indirect multihop routing improves the achievable sum throughput as @xmath9 .",
    "information - theoretic outer bounds on throughput scaling laws of ad hoc wireless networks were derived in @xcite .",
    "these bounds showed that the multihop routing using neighbor nodes is order - optimal in the power - limited and high attenuation regime .",
    "recently , a hierarchical cooperation scheme was proposed in @xcite and was shown to achieve better throughput scaling than the multihop strategy in the interference - limited or low attenuation regime , achieving a scaling very close to their new outer bound .",
    "a more general hierarchical cooperation was proposed in @xcite , which works for an arbitrary node distribution in which a minimum separation between nodes is guaranteed .",
    "recently _ hybrid network _",
    "models have been studied as well .",
    "hybrid networks are ad hoc networks in which the nodes communication is aided by additional infrastructures such as base stations ( bss ) .",
    "these are generally assumed to have high bandwidth connections to each other . in @xcite",
    "the connectivity of hybrid networks has been analyzed . in @xcite",
    "the throughput scaling of hybrid networks has been studied . in order for a hybrid network s throughput scaling to outperform that of a strictly ad hoc network , it was determined that the number of bss should be greater than a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "the existing literatures have focused on the throughput scaling of a _ single _ network .",
    "however , the necessity of extending and expanding results to capture _ multiple _ overlapping networks is becoming apparent .",
    "recent measurements have shown that despite increasing demands for bandwidth , much of the currently licensed spectrum remains unused a surprisingly large portion of the time @xcite . in the us , this has led the federal communications commission ( fcc ) to consider easing the regulations towards _ secondary spectrum sharing _ through their _ secondary markets initiative _ @xcite . the essence of secondary spectrum sharing involves having primary license holders allow secondary license holders to access the spectrum .",
    "different types of spectrum sharing exist but most agree that the primary users have a higher priority access to the spectrum , while secondary users _ opportunistically _ use it .",
    "these secondary users often require greater sensing abilities and more flexible and diverse communication abilities than legacy primary users .",
    "secondary users are often assumed to be _ cognitive radios _ , or wireless devices which are able to transmit and receive according to a variety of protocols and are also able to sense and independently adapt to their environment @xcite .",
    "these features allow them to behave in a more `` intelligent '' manner than current wireless devices .    in this paper , we consider _ cognitive networks _ , which consist of secondary , or cognitive , users who wish to transmit over the spectrum licensed to the primary users .",
    "the single - user case in which a single primary and a single cognitive s - d pairs share the spectrum has been considered in the literature , see for example @xcite and the references therein . in @xcite the primary and cognitive s - d pairs are modeled as an interference channel with asymmetric side - information . in @xcite the communication opportunities are modeled as a two - switch channel . recently , a single - hop cognitive network was considered in @xcite , where multiple secondary s - d pairs transmit in the presence of a single primary s - d pair .",
    "it was shown that a linear scaling law of the single - hop secondary network is obtained when its operation is constrained to guarantee a particular outage constraint for the primary s - d pair .",
    "we study a more general environment in which a _ primary ad hoc network _ and a _ cognitive ad hoc network _ both share the same space , time and frequency dimensions . two types of primary networks are considered in this paper @xmath10 : an ad hoc primary network and an infrastructure - supported primary network . for the ad hoc primary model ,",
    "the primary network consists of @xmath0 nodes randomly distributed and grouped into s - d pairs at random . for the infrastructure - supported primary model , additional @xmath1 bss are regularly deployed and used to support the primary transmissions . in both cases , the cognitive network consists of @xmath2 secondary nodes distributed randomly and s - d pairs are again chosen randomly .",
    "our main assumptions are that ( 1 ) the primary network continues to operate as if no secondary network were present , ( 2 ) the secondary nodes know the locations of the primary nodes and ( 3 ) the secondary network is denser than the primary network . under these assumptions , we will illustrate routing protocols for the primary and secondary networks that result in the _ same throughput scaling _ as if each were a single network .",
    "note that the constraint that the primary network does _ not _ alter its protocol because of the secondary network is what makes the problem non - trivial .",
    "indeed , if the primary network were to change its protocol when the secondary network is present , a simple time - sharing scheme is able to achieve the throughput scaling of homogeneous networks for both primary and secondary networks .    for the ad hoc primary model",
    ", we use a routing protocol that is a simple modification of the nearest neighbor multihop schemes in @xcite . for the infrastructure - supported primary model",
    ", we use a bs - based transmission similar to the scheme in @xcite .",
    "we propose novel routing protocols for the secondary network under each primary network model .",
    "our proposed protocols use multihop routing , in which the secondary routes _ avoid _ passing too close to the primary nodes , reducing the interference to them .",
    "we show that the proposed protocols achieve the throughput scalings of homogeneous networks _",
    "simultaneously_. this implies that when a denser `` intelligent '' network is layered on top of a sparser oblivious one , then both may achieve the same throughput scalings as if each were a single network .",
    "this result may be extended to more than two networks , provided each layered network obeys the same three main assumptions as in the two network case .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we outline the system model : we first look at the network geometry , co - existing primary and secondary ad hoc networks , then turn to the information theoretic achievable rates before stating our assumptions on the primary and secondary network behaviors . in section [ sec : adhoc ]",
    "we outline the protocols used for the ad hoc primary model and prove that the claimed single network throughput scalings may be achieved .",
    "we also prove the claimed single network throughput scalings for the infrastructure - supported primary model in section [ sec : infra ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] and refer the proofs of the lemmas to the appendix .",
    "in order to study throughput scaling laws of ad hoc cognitive networks , we must define the underlying network models .",
    "we first explain the two geometric models that will be considered in sections [ sec : adhoc ] and [ sec : infra ] .",
    "we then look at the transmission schemes , resulting achievable rates , and assumptions made about the primary and secondary networks .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use @xmath11 to denote the probability of an event @xmath12 and we will be dealing with events which take place with high probability ( w.h.p . ) , or with probability 1 as the node density tends to infinity . ] .",
    "we consider a planar area in which a network of primary nodes and a network of secondary nodes co - exist .",
    "that is , the two networks share the same space , time , code , and frequency dimensions .",
    "two types of networks are considered as the primary network : an _ ad hoc network _ and an _ infrastructure - supported network _ , while the secondary network is always ad hoc .",
    "the two geometric models are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2models ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2models ] .",
    "( a ) , in the ad hoc primary model , nodes are distributed according to a poisson point process ( p.p.p . ) of density @xmath0 over a unit square , which are randomly grouped into primary s - d pairs . for the secondary network ,",
    "nodes are distributed according to a p.p.p . of density",
    "@xmath2 over the same unit square and are also randomly grouped into secondary s - d pairs .",
    "our second model is the infrastructure - supported primary model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2models ] .",
    "( b ) . there , primary nodes are still randomly distributed over the square according to a p.p.p . of density @xmath0 , but these nodes are supported by additional @xmath1 regularly spaced bss ( the number of bss is equal to @xmath1 , which is also the density of bss ) .",
    "the bss sole purpose is to relay data for the primary network , they are neither sources nor destinations .",
    "we assume that the bss are connected to each other through wired lines of capacity large enough such that the bs - bs communication is not the limiting factor in the throughput scaling laws .",
    "secondary nodes again form an ad hoc network with random s - d pairs , distributed according to a p.p.p . of density @xmath2 .",
    "the densities of the @xmath0 primary nodes , @xmath2 secondary nodes , and @xmath1 bss are related according to @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we focus on the case where the density of the secondary nodes is higher than that of the primary nodes .",
    "we also assume that the densities of both the primary nodes and secondary nodes are higher than that of the bss , which is reasonable from a practical point of view .",
    "the wireless propagation channel typically includes path loss with distance , shadowing and fading effects .",
    "however , in this work we assume the channel gain depends only on the distance between a transmitter and its receiver , and ignore shadowing and fading .",
    "thus , the channel power gain @xmath16 , normalized by a constant , is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the distance between a transmitter ( tx ) and its receiver ( rx ) and @xmath19 denotes the path - loss exponent .",
    "each network operates based on slotted transmissions .",
    "we assume the duration of each slot , and the coding scheme employed are such that one can achieve the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel capacity . for a given signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) , this capacity is given by the well known formula @xmath20 bps / hz assuming the additive interference is also white , gaussian , and independent from the noise and signal .",
    "we assume that primary slots and secondary slots have the same duration and are synchronized with each other .",
    "we further assume all the primary , secondary , and bs nodes are subject to a transmit power constraint @xmath21 .",
    "we now characterize the rates achieved by the primary and secondary transmit pairs .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 primary pairs and @xmath23 secondary pairs communicate simultaneously . before proceeding with a detailed description ,",
    "let us define the notations used in the paper , given by table [ table : simbols ] .",
    "then , the @xmath24-th primary pair can communicate at a rate of @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the euclidean norm of a vector .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 similarly , the @xmath31-th secondary pair can communicate at a rate of @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36    throughout the paper , the achievable per - node throughput of the primary and secondary networks are defined as follows .",
    "a throughput of @xmath37 per primary node is said to be achievable w.h.p .",
    "if all primary sources can transmit at a rate of @xmath37 ( bps / hz ) to their primary destinations w.h.p . in the presence of the secondary network .",
    "let @xmath38 denote an outage probability of the secondary network , which may vary as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "a throughput of @xmath39 per secondary node is said to be @xmath40-achievable w.h.p .",
    "if at least @xmath41 fraction of secondary sources can transmit at a rate of @xmath39 ( bps / hz ) to their secondary destinations w.h.p . in the presence of the primary network .    for both ad hoc and infrastructure - supported primary models",
    ", we will propose secondary routing schemes that make @xmath42 as @xmath43 is equivalent to @xmath44 since @xmath45 . ] .",
    "thus , although we allow a fraction of secondary s - d pairs to be in outage , for sufficiently large @xmath2 , almost all secondary s - d pairs will be served at a rate of @xmath39 .",
    "let us define @xmath46 as the sum throughput of the primary network , or @xmath37 times the number of primary s - d pairs since the nodes are thrown at random according to a p.p.p . of density @xmath0 .",
    "the actual number of nodes in the network will vary in a particular realization . ] .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath47 as the sum throughput of the secondary network , or @xmath39 times the number of _ served _ secondary s - d pairs at a rate of @xmath39 . while @xmath37 and @xmath46 represent the per - node and sum throughputs of the primary network _ in the presence of the secondary network _ , we use the notations @xmath48 and @xmath49 to denote the per - node and sum throughputs of the primary network _ in the absence of the secondary network _ , respectively .      as primary and secondary nodes must share the spectrum , the rules or assumptions made about this co - existence are of critical importance to the resulting achievable throughputs and scaling laws .",
    "primary networks may be thought of as existing communication systems that operate in licensed bands .",
    "these primary users are the license holders , and thus have higher priority access to the spectrum than secondary users .",
    "thus , our first key assumption is that _ the primary network does not have to change its protocol due to the secondary network . _ in other words , all primary s - d pairs communicate with each other as intended , regardless of the secondary network .",
    "the secondary network , which is opportunistic in nature , is responsible for reducing its interference to the primary network to an `` acceptable level '' , while maximizing its own throughput @xmath39 .",
    "this acceptable level may be defined to be one that does not degrade the throughput scaling of the primary network .",
    "more strictly , the secondary network should satisfy w.h.p .",
    "@xmath50 during its transmission , where @xmath51 is the maximum allowable fraction of throughput loss for the primary network .",
    "notice that the above condition guarantees @xmath52 .",
    "the secondary network may ensure ( [ eq : fraction_loss ] ) by adjusting its protocol based on information about the primary network .",
    "thus , our second key assumption is that _ the secondary network knows the locations of all primary nodes .",
    "_ since the secondary network is denser than the primary network , each secondary node can measure the interference power from its adjacent primary node and send it to a coordinator node . based on these measured values ,",
    "the secondary network can establish the locations of the primary nodes .",
    "we first consider the throughput scaling laws when both the primary and secondary networks are ad hoc in nature . since the primary network needs not change its transmission scheme due to the presence of the secondary network , we assume it transmits according to the direct multihop routing similar to those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also consider the indirect multihop routing proposed in @xcite as a primary protocol . of greater interest",
    "is how the secondary nodes will transmit such that the primary network remains unaffected in terms of throughput scaling .",
    "the main results of this section describe achievable throughput scaling laws of the primary and secondary networks .",
    "we simply state these results here and derive them in the remainder of this section .",
    "_ suppose the ad hoc primary model .",
    "for any @xmath51 , the primary network can achieve the following per - node and sum throughputs w.h.p .",
    ": @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the following per - node and sum throughputs are @xmath40-achievable w.h.p . for the secondary network : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , which converges to zero as @xmath58 . _",
    "this result is of particular interest as it shows that not only can the primary network operate at the same scaling law as when the secondary network does not exist , but the secondary network can also achieve , with an arbitrarily small fraction of outage , the exact same scaling law obtained by the direct multihop routing as when the primary network does not exist .",
    "thus almost all secondary s - d pairs can communicate at a rate of @xmath39 in the limit of large @xmath2 .",
    "in essence , whether the indirect multihop or the direct multihop is adopted as a primary protocol , the secondary network can achieve the sum throughput of @xmath59 w.h.p . while preserving @xmath60 fraction of the primary network s stand - alone throughput .    in the remainder of this section , we first outline the operation of the primary network and then focus on the design of a secondary network protocol under the given primary protocol .",
    "we analyze achievable throughputs of the primary and secondary networks , which will determine the throughput scaling of both co - existing networks . throughout this work ,",
    "we place the proofs of more technical lemmas and theorems in the appendix and outline the main proofs in the text .",
    "we assume the primary network communicates according to the direct multihop routing protocol .",
    "the indirect multihop routing will be explained in section [ subsec : indirect_routing ] , which can be extended from the results of the direct routing .",
    "the challenge is thus to prove that the secondary nodes can exchange information in such a way that satisfies @xmath61 w.h.p .. we first outline a primary network protocol , and then design a secondary network protocol which operates in the presence of the primary network .",
    "we assume that the primary network delivers data using the direct multihop routing , in a manner similar to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic multihop protocol is as follows :    * divide the unit area into square cells of area @xmath62 . *",
    "a @xmath63- time division multiple access ( tdma ) scheme is used , in which each cell is activated during one out of @xmath63 slots .",
    "* define the horizontal data path ( hdp ) and the vertical data path ( vdp ) of a s - d pair as the horizontal line and the vertical line connecting a source to its destination , respectively .",
    "each source transmits data to its destination by first hopping to the adjacent cells on its hdp and then on its vdp .",
    "* when a cell becomes active , it delivers its traffic .",
    "specifically , a tx node in the active cell transmits a packet to a node in an adjacent cell ( or in the same cell ) .",
    "a simple round - robin scheme is used for all tx nodes in the same cell .",
    "* at each transmission , a tx node transmits with power @xmath64 , where @xmath18 denotes the distance between the tx and its rx .",
    "this protocol requires full connectivity , meaning that each cell should have at least one node .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the area of a primary cell .",
    "the following lemma indicates how to determine @xmath65 satisfying this requirement .    [ thm : node_number ] the following facts hold .",
    "+ ( a ) the number of primary nodes in a unit area is within @xmath66 w.h.p . , where @xmath67 is an arbitrarily small constant .",
    "+ ( b ) suppose @xmath68 .",
    "then , each primary cell has at least one primary node w.h.p ..    the proof is in the appendix .",
    "based on lemma [ thm : node_number ] , we set @xmath68 . under the given primary protocol ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are achievable w.h.p . when the secondary network is absent or silent .",
    "results similar to lemma [ thm : node_number ] can be found in @xcite and @xcite , where their proposed schemes also achieve the same @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that the gupta - kumar s model @xcite , @xcite assumes uniformly distributed nodes in the network and a constant rate between tx and rx if sinr is higher than a certain level .",
    "although we assume that the network is constructed according to a p.p.p .",
    "( rather than uniform ) and that the information - theoretic rate @xmath71 is achievable ( rather than a constant rate ) , the above primary network protocol provides the same throughput scaling as that under the gupta - kumar s model .",
    "since the secondary nodes know the primary nodes locations , an intuitive idea is to have the secondary network operate in a multihop fashion in which they circumvent each primary node in order to reduce the effect of secondary transmissions to the primary nodes . in @xcite",
    "a network with holes is considered and geographic forwarding algorithms that establish routing paths around holes are proposed .    around",
    "each primary node we define its _ preservation region : _ a square containing @xmath63 secondary cells , with the primary node at the center cell .",
    "the secondary nodes , when determining their routing paths , need to avoid these preservation regions : our protocol for the secondary ad hoc network is the same as the basic multihop protocol except that    * the secondary cell size is @xmath72 . * at each transmission a secondary node transmits its packet _ three _ times repeatedly ( rather than once ) using three slots .",
    "* the secondary paths avoid the preservation regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : secodary_routing_adhoc ] ) .",
    "that is , if the hdp or vdp of a secondary s - d pair is blocked by a preservation region , this data path circumvents the preservation region by using its adjacent cells .",
    "if a secondary source ( or its destination ) belongs to preservation regions or its data path is disconnected by preservation regions , the corresponding s - d pair is not served .",
    "* at each transmission , a tx node transmits with power @xmath73 , where @xmath18 denotes the distance between the tx and its rx and @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath75 converges to zero as @xmath58 , there exists @xmath76 such that the power constraint is satisfied for any @xmath74 if @xmath77",
    ". we will show in lemma [ thm : primary_rate_adhoc1 ] that adjusting @xmath78 induces a trade - off between the rates of the primary and secondary networks while the scaling laws of both networks are unchanged , which allows the condition ( [ eq : fraction_loss ] ) to be meet .",
    "unlike the primary protocol , each secondary cell transmits a secondary packet three times repeatedly when it is activated . as we will show later",
    ", the repeated secondary transmissions can guarantee the secondary receivers a certain minimum distance from all primary interferers for at least one packet , thus guaranteeing the secondary network a non - trivial rate .",
    "therefore , the duration of the secondary @xmath63-tdma scheme is three times longer than that of the primary @xmath63-tdma .",
    "the main difference between this scheme and previous multihop routing schemes is that the secondary multihop paths must circumvent the preservation regions and that a portion of secondary s - d pairs is not served .",
    "but this portion will be negligible as @xmath43 . by re - routing the secondary nodes transmission around the primary nodes preservation regions",
    ", we can guarantee the primary nodes a non - trivial rate .",
    "similar to lemma [ thm : node_number ] , we can also prove that the total number of secondary nodes is within @xmath79 w.h.p . and that each secondary cell has at least one secondary node w.h.p ..      in this subsection",
    ", we analyze the per - node and sum throughputs of each network under the given protocols and derive throughput scaling laws with respect to the node densities .",
    "let us consider the primary network in the presence of the secondary network .",
    "we first show that each primary cell can sustain a constant aggregate rate ( lemma [ thm : primary_rate_adhoc1 ] ) , which may be used in conjunction with the number of data paths each primary cell must transmit ( lemma [ thm : primary_traffic_adhoc ] ) to obtain the per - node and sum throughputs in theorem [ thm : primary_throughput_adhoc ] .",
    "let @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the achievable aggregate rate of each primary cell in the presence and in the absence of the secondary network , respectively .",
    "we define @xmath82 having a finite value for @xmath19 , which will be used to derive an upper bound on the interference power of the ad hoc primary and secondary networks . then the following lemma holds .",
    "[ thm : primary_rate_adhoc1 ] suppose the ad hoc primary model .",
    "if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is given by ( [ eq : def_i ] ) . moreover , @xmath81 is lower bounded by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a constant independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the proof is in the appendix .",
    "the essence of the proof of lemma [ thm : primary_rate_adhoc1 ] lies in showing that the secondary nodes , even as @xmath43 , do not cause the aggregate rate of each primary cell to decay with @xmath2 .",
    "this is done by introducing the preservation regions , which guarantee the minimum distance of @xmath89 from all secondary txs to the primary rxs .",
    "this lemma will be used to show that ( [ eq : fraction_loss ] ) can be satisfied w.h.p . if @xmath83 in theorem [ thm : primary_throughput_adhoc ] .",
    "the next lemma determines the number of data paths that each cell should carry . to obtain an upper bound",
    ", we extend each hdp to the entire horizontal line and all cells through which this horizontal line passes should deliver the corresponding data of hdp ( see fig .",

    "similarly , we extend each vdp to the entire vertical line .",
    "we define this entire horizontal and vertical line as an _ extended _ hdp and an _ extended _ vdp , respectively . throughout the rest of the paper , our analysis deals with extended hdps and vdps instead of original hdps and vdps .",
    "since we are adding hops to our routing scheme , the extended traffic gives us a lower bound on the achievable throughput .",

    "let us now consider the per - node throughput of the secondary network in the presence of the primary network .",
    "the main difference between the primary and secondary transmission schemes arises from the presence of the preservation regions .",
    "recall that the secondary nodes wish to transmit according to a multihop protocol , but their path may be blocked by a preservation region . in this case , they must circumvent the preservation region , or possibly the _",
    "cluster _ of primary preservation regions .",
    "however , as we will see later circumventing these preservation regions ( clusters ) does not degrade the secondary network s throughput scaling due to the relative primary and secondary node densities : the secondary nodes increase at the rate @xmath101 and @xmath14 .",
    "thus , intuitively , as the density @xmath0 of the primary nodes increases , the area of each preservation region ( which equals 9 secondary cells ) decreases faster than the increase rate of the primary node density ( and thus number of preservation regions ) .",
