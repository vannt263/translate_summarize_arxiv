    "the statistical characterization and modeling of two - phase disordered microstructure is a central problem in many fundamental and applied sciences  @xcite .",
    "predicting the properties of disordered materials relies on the availability of accurate microstructural models , which rely in turn on accurate statistical characterization .",
    "after the volume fraction of each phase , and interfacial surface area , the most important statistical quantity is the two - point correlation function which is obtained from cross - sectional micrographs , or small angle scattering experiments .",
    "although the two - point correlation function is very useful , there are a variety of important problems where more detailed statistical information is necessary .",
    "another useful characteristic of microstructure , which has proved essential in theory and application , is the chord - length distribution function  @xcite .",
    "the chord functions play an important role in stereology  @xcite , mineralogy  @xcite , the interpretation of small angle x - ray scattering data  @xcite , and have been incorporated in theories of mass transport in porous media  @xcite .",
    "recently the chord functions ( and the related `` lineal - path '' function  @xcite ) have been employed in the generation of three - dimensional ( 3d ) microstructural models for predicting macroscopic properties  @xcite . in this paper , we derive approximate forms of the chord functions for a relatively new model of random media based on gaussian random fields .    a useful model of two - phase random porous and composite media is obtained by modeling the internal interface of the microstructure as the iso - surface ( or level - cut ) of a correlated gaussian random field @xmath0",
    "@xcite . a region of space",
    "can be divided into two phases ( e.g.  pore and solid ) according to whether @xmath0 is less or greater than some threshold .",
    "we define phase 1 to occupy the region where @xmath1 and phase 2 to occupy the region where @xmath2 .",
    "this is illustrated for two dimensions in figs .",
    "[ cdf](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the model , and variants , have proved useful in describing the microstructure of many different materials  @xcite ; and a more thorough characterization of the microstructure is an important goal .",
    "the two- and three - point correlation functions of the model can be calculated , but the chord functions are presently measured from simulations  @xcite .",
    "there are advantages ( for speed , accuracy and interpretation ) in obtaining analytic expressions for the chord functions of the model .",
    "as we show , the problem is equivalent to finding the probability density governing the time it takes for a gaussian random process to first cross an arbitrary threshold .",
    "this is a conventional first - passage time problem .",
    "20.5pc = 8.0 cm    first - passage time problems arise in many branches of physics  @xcite , information theory  @xcite , queuing theory  @xcite , ocean science  @xcite and reliability studies in the engineering sciences  @xcite amongst others .",
    "for this reason the problem has received a great deal of attention .",
    "rice actually provided a formal series solution to the problem for gaussian processes  @xcite .",
    "however , the series involves very difficult integrals of which only the first is generally evaluated  @xcite ; the results being accurate for small time .",
    "there are many approaches to finding useful approximations for first - passage times ( the aforementioned references provide reviews of the literature in each field ) . here",
    "we restrict attention to methods based on the assumption that the lengths of successive chords are independent .",
    "this idea can be traced back to siegert  @xcite and mcfadden  @xcite .",
    "the approximation we use is most clearly derived from the independent interval process  @xcite for which the assumption of independent chords is true by definition .",
    "this approach was recently suggested for the calculation of persistence times in coarsening  @xcite .",
    "the method can be extended to obtain the chord - distributions , and actually provides an extremely useful way of viewing related problems in different fields .",
    "in the following sections we derive some properties of the chord function and the independent interval process . the model is then applied to approximate the chord functions of level - cut gaussian random fields .",
    "finally , we compare the theoretical results with experimental data .",
    "for a two - phase medium , there is a chord - distribution associated with each phase @xmath3 ( @xmath4=1,2 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen chord in phase @xmath4 ( a line segment with end points on the phase interface ) has length in the range @xmath6 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ cdf](b ) , we illustrate calculation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for isotropic media : an `` infinite '' line ( or many shorter ones with arbitrary orientation ) is drawn through the material , and the number of chords in phase 1 [ @xmath9 with length in the range @xmath6 $ ] is counted . if @xmath10 is the total number of chords of phase 1 , then @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is defined in an analogous manner .",
    "an important quantity is the number of phase crossings per unit length @xmath13 .",
    "a fundamental relation in stereology gives @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the specific surface , i.e. , the surface area to total volume ratio of a 3d composite .",
    "another useful relation follows from the fact that total length of the chords is equal to that of the original line : @xmath16 . if we divide by @xmath10 and convert the sums to integrals we have @xmath17 .",
    "similarly @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume fraction of phase @xmath4 .",
    "this gives the relation @xmath20 .",
    "these equalities are used extensively below .",
    "a useful statistical quantity is the lineal - path function of each phase @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , which represents the probability that a random line segment of length @xmath23 thrown into the material falls completely within phase @xmath4 and is related to @xmath24 by @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "one reason for the usefulness of the chord function is that @xmath24 can be directly interpreted in terms of observable microstructure features .",
    "first , if @xmath26 then , at the resolution at which it is measured , phase @xmath4 contains sharp corners .",
    "second , the value at which @xmath24 takes a maximum value provides an estimate of the length scale associated with phase @xmath4 .",
    "another is provided by the average chord length @xmath27 .",
    "third , if @xmath28 for large @xmath23 , connected regions in phase @xmath4 at scale @xmath23 exist .",
    "this `` connectedness '' information ( along a lineal path ) is clearly important if long - range phenomena ( like macroscopic properties ) are to be studied .",
    "the direct relationship between @xmath24 and morphology shows that the chord functions give a strong `` signature '' of microstructure and are therefore an important tool in the characterization of porous and composite media .",
    "the chord and lineal - path functions are closely related to first - passage times in the theory of stationary time - dependent random processes . the analogy is shown in fig .  [ cdf](c ) .",
    "if the values of a random - field along a line are plotted against time a one - dimensional ( 1d ) random process @xmath29 is obtained . if a down - crossing of the threshold @xmath30 occurs at @xmath31 [ so @xmath32 , the probability that the process first exceeds the threshold in the interval @xmath33 $ ] is @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding density for the first down - crossing after an up - crossing ( sometimes called the second - passage time ) is @xmath35 .",
    "there are several other common first - passage times which relate to our work .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is a random process representing the response of an electrical or mechanical component which fails if @xmath29 exceeds some ( generally high ) threshold ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "a key quantity is the probability of failure @xmath37 in the interval @xmath38 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "since the safe region is phase 1 the failure probability is just @xmath39 [ @xmath40 being the probability of instantaneous failure ] .",
    "a related quantity is the probability distribution of failure times @xmath41 given that @xmath42 is in the safe region  @xcite .",
    "this is given by @xmath43 .",
    "the independent interval process  @xcite is constructed by taking the lengths of successive intervals to be independent of one another and distributed according to the probability ( chord ) distribution functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 for phase 1 and 2 respectively ( this implies a stationary process ) . since this completely defines the process it is possible to derive all other statistical properties ( such as the two - point correlation function ) from @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the indicator function @xmath44 ( which is unity in phase 1 and zero in phase 2 ) is very useful in this regard . from above we have @xmath45 note that the results are true irrespective of correlations between successive chords .",
    "now consider the two - point correlation function which is defined as @xmath46 stationarity of the process ( and isotropy in more than one dimension ) implies that the average only depends on @xmath47 . to express @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath12 it is necessary to derive some preliminary results .",
    "the method is adapted from ref .",
    "although the model is independent of any random field it is useful to describe the left - hand ends of chords in phase 1 and 2 as down - crossings and up - crossings , respectively ( see fig  [ cdf ] ) . consider the probability @xmath50 that a point at distance @xmath51 to the right of an up - crossing ( or right - hand end of a chord in phase 1 ) falls in phase 1 .",
    "suppose the chord ( of phase 2 ) immediately to the right of the down - crossing has length @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 then the point falls in phase 2 . if @xmath54 the chance that the point falls in phase 1 is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the probability that that a point a distance @xmath57 to the right of a down - crossing falls in phase 1",
    "thus @xmath58 now consider the converse problem for @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the length of the first chord ( of phase 1 ) to the right of a down - crossing .",
    "the probability that a point a distance @xmath51 from the down - crossing falls in phase 1 is unity if @xmath61 and @xmath62 if @xmath63 giving @xmath64 taking laplace transforms of both equations and solving we have @xmath65 where @xmath66=@xmath67=@xmath68 denotes the usual laplace transform .",
    "next we need the probability @xmath69 that an arbitrary point will fall in phase 1 a distance @xmath70 $ ] from the left of the first down - crossing on its right .",
    "the chance that the point falls on a 1-chord of length @xmath71 $ ] is @xmath72 .",
    "the point will be uniformly distributed along the chord , therefore if it falls on a chord of length @xmath60 the probability that it lies a distance @xmath70 $ ] from the left end is just @xmath73 . to obtain the total probability we must sum over all chords with @xmath74 giving , @xmath75 note that @xmath76 as it should since the probability that a point lies within a distance @xmath77 ( to the left ) of a down - crossing must be @xmath78 .",
    "recall that @xmath79 is the probability that two points a distance @xmath51 apart fall in phase 1 .",
    "the chance that the second point falls in phase 1 ( given that the first does ) depends on whether the distance to the first up - crossing @xmath57 is greater or less than the distance @xmath51 . if @xmath80 then the right - hand point falls in phase 1 with unit probability .",
    "if @xmath81 then the right - hand point falls in phase 1 with probability @xmath82 .",
    "thus we have @xmath83 note that @xmath84 as it should since @xmath85 is just the probability that a single point falls in phase 1 .",
    "taking laplace transforms we obtain @xmath86    two other correlation functions of the independent interval process are important for later discussions .",
    "the first , @xmath87 is the 1d analog of the surface - void correlation function which arises in the study of 3d porous materials  @xcite .",
    "the second is the crossing - crossing correlation function @xmath88 analogous to the surface - surface correlation function  @xcite .",
    "again , stationarity implies that @xmath89 and @xmath90 depend only on the distance @xmath47 .    from the definition of @xmath89",
    "we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 is small .",
    "the expression on the right - hand side is the probability that @xmath93 lies within a distance @xmath94 ( which we call an @xmath92-interval ) of a crossing and that @xmath95 lies in phase 1 . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider the case @xmath96 .",
    "now there is an equal chance of the first point landing in an @xmath92-interval of an up or down crossing ( probability @xmath97 ) .",
    "the probability that @xmath95 falls in phase 1 is then either @xmath50 or @xmath59 .",
    "hence , for @xmath98 , @xmath99\\ ] ] or , using laplace transforms , @xmath100    similarly we write the crossing - crossing correlation function as @xmath101 where the expression on the right is clearly the probability that both points lie within an @xmath92-interval of a crossing . to express this quantity in terms of the chord - distributions",
    "several additional functions are needed .",
    "let @xmath102 be the probability that a point a distance @xmath51 from an up - crossing falls in an @xmath92 interval of a down crossing .",
    "this can occur in two ways ; either the first chord of phase 2 adjacent the up - crossing has length @xmath103 , or @xmath54 in which case the point falls near a down crossing with probability @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the probability that a point a distance @xmath57 to the right of a down - crossing is in an @xmath92-interval of a down - crossing .",
    "this is expressed as @xmath106 the functions @xmath107 , @xmath108 are similarly defined and three additional relations amongst the four functions can be derived and solved to give @xmath109 now from the definition of @xmath90 it is clear that @xmath110\\ ] ] as @xmath98 . after taking laplace transforms this gives @xmath111 a final expression which is useful for relating this work to prior approaches is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the probability that a point a distance @xmath51 from a point in phase 1 falls within an @xmath92-interval of an up - crossing , and @xmath114 is the probability distribution of `` failure times '' discussed earlier .",
    "although this analysis of the independent interval process , and the results for @xmath89 and @xmath90 appear new , variants of eq .",
    "( [ s11hat ] ) for @xmath48 have actually been derived in several quite different contexts .",
    "it is useful to briefly demonstrate these connections .",
    "the poisson - boolean model  @xcite of random two - phase media has been widely studied and applied . in this model ,",
    "grains ( which may be of different shapes and sizes ) are placed at uncorrelated random points in space ( so the grains may overlap ) . for spherical inclusions this",

    "for convex grains of any shape or size , the chord - distribution function of the phase exterior to the grains is @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "since the grains are uncorrelated in space and convex it is clear that the length of successive chords along any line through the a realization of the model will be independent .",

    "we have derived a semi - analytic approximation for the chord distribution functions ( @xmath49 and @xmath12 ) of 3d random media .",
