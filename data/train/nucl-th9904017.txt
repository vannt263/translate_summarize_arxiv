    "the description of the masses of the baryon octet in @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory is not in a satisfactory state . using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) borasoy and",
    "meissner @xcite have carried calculations to order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes a small momentum or a meson mass .",
    "the contributions of order @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 are of roughly similar magnitude with alternating sign , thus casting doubt on the convergence of the expansion .",
    "donoghue and holstein @xcite have suggested that the loop integrals should be regularized by introducing form factors . while this can be used to make the loop contributions tiny , it has the disadvantage of being model dependent and it is difficult to see how to apply it consistently in general situations .",
    "an alternative approach has recently been suggested by becher and leutwyler @xcite following the work of ref .",
    "it employs chiral perturbation theory in manifestly lorentz invariant form with the loop integrals evaluated in the so - called infrared regularization ( ir ) scheme .",
    "our purpose here is to examine this scheme in the context of the baryon masses .    in sec .",
    "ii we recall the necessary aspects of chiral perturbation theory and the infrared regularization scheme .",
    "our results are given in sec .",
    "iii , first through third order and then including an estimate of fourth order . finally our conclusions are presented in sec .",

    "the quark mass matrix is @xmath12 and this can be related to the meson masses to leading order @xmath13 for present purposes we can use the above gell - mann - okubo relation for the @xmath14 mass ; we take @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 gev yielding @xmath17 gev .",
    "the order @xmath3 contribution to the baryon masses take the familiar form @xmath18    the order @xmath4 contribution arises from the loop diagram pictured in fig .",
    "1 and the guts of this is the integral @xmath19 in dimension @xmath20 , with @xmath21 denoting the four - momentum of the external baryon leg , @xmath22 . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that  hard \" part of the integral , dominated by poles at momenta of the order of the baryon mass , should be absorbed in the coefficients of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the  soft \" part of the integral on the other hand needs to be calculated explicitly and can be obtained by expanding out @xmath23 from the baryon propagator and interchanging the order of integration and summation ( the latter of course changes the value of the integral ) . in dimensional",
    "regularization the net effect is that @xmath23 is replaced by @xmath24 so that ( [ heq ] ) is replaced by @xmath25 a similar result has been obtained by becher and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "they combine the denominators in eq .",
    "( [ heq ] ) using an integration over a feynman parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the  soft \" part is then defined by extending the integration range from 01 to 0@xmath27 and this includes the infrared singular contribution of leading order @xmath28 in the chiral limit @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the net effect of these maneuvers is to replace the denominator @xmath31 in @xmath32 by the denominator @xmath33^{-1}$ ] to give @xmath34 in ( [ ieq ] ) .",
    "these authors refer to this as infrared regularization . in heavy baryon theory the second denominator in ( [ ieq ] )",
    "is expanded out thus leaving @xmath35 in leading order .",
    "becher and leutwyler have argued against making this expansion since it breaks down in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "the present procedure can be viewed as a summation of the heavy baryon insertions in the baryon propagator to all orders .",
    "the leading order term preserves the weinberg power counting , but in addition higher order contributions are included .",
    "the integral that needs to be evaluated for the loop diagram of fig .",
    "1 is @xmath36 we apply the so - called infrared regularization on shell , @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting integrals contain ultraviolet divergences and these are removed in the standard @xmath38 scheme ; this requires polynomial counterterms of arbitrarily high order in @xmath2 which we do not need to specify .",
    "( [ hfull ] ) becomes @xmath39j(z , m_m)\\ ; , \\label{eqi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 this is equivalent to the expression given in ref .",
    "@xcite and is of leading order @xmath4 .",
    "it is natural to identify the renormalization scale @xmath42 in this equation with the natural scale in the problem , namely the baryon mass in the chiral limit , @xmath43 .",
    "the total third order contribution is then @xmath44 , where the coefficients @xmath45 are easily evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) and are listed in the appendix .    to evaluate the baryon masses in fourth order @xmath46 requires additional terms besides those displayed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l2 ] ) .",
    "they contribute to the loop integrals , but the value of the coefficients is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "further , the finite parts of @xmath47 play a role at tree level , again introducing unknown coefficients .",
    "borasoy and meissner @xcite estimated these low energy constants .",
    "they concluded that , while their effect is not negligible , the dominant fourth order contribution arises from the meson loop diagram pictured in fig .",
    "2 evaluated using the three terms of @xmath46 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l2 ] ) .",
    "therefore we will consider just this contribution in order to get an estimate of the magnitude of fourth order .",
    "since only loops containing baryons require special treatment in order to keep track of the chiral order , the meson tadpole diagram of fig .",
    "2 is evaluated in standard fashion irrespective of whether the ir or hbchpt schemes are used .",
    "for nucleons the result , once divergences have been absorbed in the counterterms , is @xmath48 and , as we have remarked , we take @xmath49 .",
    "the contributions for the remaining baryons can be read off from ref . @xcite .",
    "in order to get a first comparison of ( [ eqi ] ) with the corresponding heavy baryon result we simply use the physical masses of the particles and pick a reasonable value of the renormalization scale , @xmath50 gev . the decay constant @xmath51 is taken to be the average of the kaon and pion decay constants @xcite , @xmath52 gev .",
    "for the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 we take the ratio from close and roberts @xcite and their sum is the axial coupling constant @xcite , giving @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the result is labelled irex in table 1 and can be compared with the heavy baryon case , labelled hb , for which eq . ( [ eqi ] )",
    "is simply replaced by @xmath57 .",
    "the dominant effect comes from the ratio @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ jeq ] ) which is set to zero in the heavy baryon approach , but can be as large as 0.7 in magnitude here .",
    "clearly it is largest when @xmath59 which is always the case for the kaons , since they carry strangeness , and they dominate numerically . in comparison to the heavy baryon case",
    "the net result is a rather small increase for the @xmath60 and @xmath61 and a fairly substantial , @xmath62% , reduction for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "obviously this is not a consistent procedure and since @xmath24 is of @xmath65 we should treat the baryon masses to the same order .",
    "thus we should evaluate @xmath66 .",
    "the total baryon mass through third order is then @xmath67 .",
    "further , as we have remarked , we wish to choose the renormalization scale to be the baryon mass in the chiral limit ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath49 . in order to disentangle the constants @xmath43 and @xmath68 we need a further piece of information for which we select the @xmath69 sigma term , @xmath70 .",
    "the actual value of the sigma term is not precisely known , but for present purposes we will take the currently accepted figure of 45 mev from gasser _ et al .",
    "this allows us to determine the unknown parameters @xmath71 and @xmath43 by performing a least squares fit to the baryon masses and @xmath72 . the strange quark contribution to the nucleon mass @xmath73",
    "can then be calculated .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 mev .",
    "while the magnitude of @xmath75 is poorly known , this appears a little large so we constrained @xmath75 to be 200 mev in the final fit shown under the rubric ir in tables 1 and 2 ; this degraded the accuracy of the fit to the baryon masses by about 10 mev .",
    "note that a positive value for @xmath75 is favored here , whereas the heavy baryon case @xcite gives a negative value of similar magnitude .",
    "this would suggest larger @xmath76 sigma terms here for which there is some weak experimental support @xcite .",
    "( to obtain the parameters listed in the heavy baryon column of table 2 the masses and @xmath72 were fitted with a resulting @xmath77 mev . )",
    "table 1 gives some indication of the sensitivity to the baryon masses employed .",
    "the net loop results evaluated in the ir scheme are now in all cases smaller than in the hb case with the reduction ranging from 9% for the @xmath61 to 63% for the @xmath63 and the bulk of the effect arises from the kaon loop contribution . note that , referring to eq .",
    "( [ jeq ] ) , the magnitude of the ratio @xmath58 varies over a wide range , from 0.04 to almost 2 .",
    "thus the assumption of the heavy baryon scheme that this ratio is small , so that a power series expansion can be made , is questionable .",
    "table 2 shows that the baryon masses are fit in the ir scheme to an accuracy @xmath78 mev .",
    "more relevant is the ratio of the third and second order contributions . in the hb case",
    "this ranges from 1.11 for the @xmath60 to 0.70 for the @xmath61 and @xmath64 , whereas in the ir case it ranges from 0.54 for the @xmath61 to 0.30 for the @xmath63 .",
    "the convergence of the expansion is clearly better in the infrared regularization scheme , due to the smaller loop integrals .",
    "the values of @xmath72 and @xmath75 used in the fit are uncertain .",
    "if @xmath72 is increased to 55 mev or @xmath75 is increased to 300 mev the fit to the masses is improved slightly and the ratio of third to second order becomes slightly smaller .",
    "conversely for a reduction of @xmath72 to 35 mev or a reduction of @xmath75 to 100 mev the results go in the opposite direction .",
    "the changes are reasonably small so that the tabulated case is representative of our results .      here",
    "we estimate fourth order by considering the diagram of fig .",
    "2.if this is calculated using the parameters previously determined , the value of the diagram in the ir scheme is 0.17 , 0.21 , 0.24 and 0.27 gev for the @xmath60 , @xmath63 , @xmath61 and @xmath64 , respectively . for the @xmath60 and the @xmath63 these contributions are similar in magnitude to third order , while for the remaining two baryons they are about half of third order . in the hb approach the renormalization scale enters for the first time in fourth order and , taking @xmath50 gev as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find 0.26 , 0.38 , 0.40 and 0.51 gev for the @xmath60 , @xmath63 , @xmath61 and @xmath64 , respectively . the difference in the magnitudes in the two schemes largely reflects the different values chosen for the renormalization scale .    since the contributions are sizeable , the parameters should be fitted as before with the fourth order contribution included .",
    "the baryon masses thus become @xmath79 .",
    "the results are given in table 3 .",
    "in the ir approach the fitting produces two minima of similar depth .",
    "we reject the solution with a rather low mass @xmath43 of 0.463 gev and a negative value of @xmath80 and display the solution which appears to evolve more naturally from the third order parameterization . here",
    "the value of @xmath43 , 0.653 gev , is about 10% smaller than in table 2 which causes the fourth order contributions to be reduced by about 37% ; the sensitivity is obviously due to the fact that @xmath43 is becoming comparable to the eta and kaon masses .",
    "the second and third order contributions display only modest changes from table 2 , while the totals give a little better fit to the masses here with an average deviation of 40 mev . in the hb case the results displayed correspond to a renormalization scale @xmath50 gev",
    "; they show qualitatively the same trends as the complete fourth order calculation of borasoy and meissner @xcite .",
    "the alternative of choosing the renormalization scale self - consistently results in @xmath81 gev and the fourth order values of table 3 are decreased by 17% , while second order shows a small 5% increase . either way the strong cancellation , and in some cases overcancellation , between second and third",
    "order remains . in the ir case",
    "however the magnitude of third order is about half that of second order , and our fourth order estimate is smaller on average by roughly a further factor of a half .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the order - by - order contributions to the sigma term @xmath82 our values for @xmath83 are quite close to those reported by borasoy and meissner @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the series for @xmath84 is similar in the two schemes , with the ir approach weakly favored . for completeness",
    "we also give breakdown of the strange quark contribution to the nucleon mass , while noting that @xmath75 was fitted in the ir calculation but left free in the hb case , @xmath85 while the behavior of the ir series looks much better , we caution that the very small value of the fourth order contribution is somewhat fortuitous since it is very sensitive to the value of the scale @xmath42 .",
    "in conclusion we have examined the numerical implications of a new form of @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory where the loop integrals are evaluated using the so - called infrared regularization scheme .",
    "we have examined the chiral series through third order and made an estimate of fourth order by evaluating the dominant contribution .",
    "the most important feature is that the magnitude of the third order loop integral contribution to the baryon octet masses is smaller in the infrared scheme than in hbchpt .",
    "this means that the strong cancellation , in some cases overcancellation , of second order that is characteristic of hbchpt no longer occurs .",
    "thus the convergence of the chiral series appears to be better when infrared regularization is used with successive terms decreasing in magnitude by about a factor of a half .",
    "given that the ratio of the kaon and eta masses to the baryon masses is of this order , this is probably the most that one could expect .",
    "we thank the referee for a useful suggestion . this work was supported in part by the us department of energy under grant de - fg02 - 87er40328 .",
    "we list here the non - zero coefficients @xmath45 needed in the evaluation of fig . 1 .",
