    "[ sec : end ] .",
    "in the following , a general description of the inc model is given and angular and energy distributions of generated events are discussed for the quasielastic semi - inclusive @xmath0 reaction on several nuclei .      the inc model was originally applied to the analysis of hadron - nucleus interactions  @xcite .",
    "it can be considered as a quasiclassical numerical representation of the multiple scattering series .",
    "it differs from the standard glauber approximation  @xcite in the description of the multiple incoherent scattering terms . in the latter , with the socalled frozen approximation ,",
    "the motion of the scattering centers is neglected , while the inc model takes it into account explicitly .    within the inc framework the linearized kinetic equation for the many - body distribution function , describing hadron transport in nuclear matter  @xcite ,",
    "is solved numerically by assuming that during the evolution of the cascade the properties of the target nucleus remain unchanged .",
    "this implies that the number of cascade particles @xmath17 is much less than the number of nucleons @xmath5 in the target nucleus . in the case of light nuclei",
    "this condition might be violated at proton momenta larger than 5 gev/@xmath2 , where events with large multiplicities could be overestimated",
    ". this condition does not prevent the application of the inc model to the description of slac  @xcite and tjnaf  @xcite data .",
    "another feature of the inc model is the fact that the model is quasiclassical .",
    "this might appear a limitation because , consequently , it can not describe genuine quantum effects such as the coherent rescattering .",
    "if those effects would be important in the case of quasielastic @xmath0 reactions the application of the inc model would be doubtful .",
    "the struck nucleon , after receiving a large @xmath4 , can in principle scatter on the residual system in a coherent and incoherent way . however , in practice in the present kinematic conditions it can not transfer a small momentum to the recoiling system because of pauli blocking .",
    "therefore , the coherent rescattering is expected to be suppressed , and incoherent rescattering can adequately be described by the inc model . on the contrary , within the conventional glauber approximation",
    "the coherent rescattering is usually overestimated , because its probability is the same as for the incoherent one and its weight is determined by the free nn total cross section .    within the inc model",
    "the target nucleus is regarded as a mixture of degenerate neutron and proton fermi gases in a spherical potential well with a diffuse surface .",
    "the momentum distribution of the nucleons is treated in the local density approximation for a fermi gas .",
    "the nucleus is divided into a series of concentric zones which help to follow the propagation of each produced particle from one zone to another . at the beginning of the cascade a large sample of struck nucleons",
    "is generated .",
    "it corresponds to the kinematic conditions of the quasielastic peak , when the energy @xmath18 of the initial electron and @xmath4 are fixed by the experiment . in this case",
    "the scattering angle for free elastic electron - proton scattering is also fixed .",
    "the momentum and angular distributions of final electrons and struck protons , created in any given zone , are determined by the fermi momentum distributions in the same zone .",
    "if necessary , final cuts in the momentum and angular distributions can be applied according to experimental acceptances .",
    "the relative numbers of struck nucleons produced in different zones are proportional to the local densities .",
    "the model describes in a straightforward way the development of the cascade when the struck proton rescatters elastically or produces any number of additional particles , such as pions . between different collisions",
    "the particles propagate along straight - line trajectories and the location of the next collision is generated assuming a weight function exponentially decreasing with the propagation distance . at each step of the cascade",
    ", the competition among different channels is governed by the channel cross sections , which are taken as in vacuum apart from the effect of the pauli exclusion principle taken into account at each collision .",
    "this means that rescattering may occur only when the momentum of each recoiling nucleon is out of the fermi sphere . in other words ,",
    "the damping of the ejectile flux along its trajectory is determined not by the free nn total cross section , but by a smaller effective cross section due to pauli blocking . in principle , the number of protons counted in the detector includes also those created with different momenta and subsequently modified by rescattering and eventually appeared within the momentum acceptance of the detector .",
    "these events , which correspond to many - fold elastic rescattering , are also taken into account by the inc mechanism .",
    "masses , energies and momentum components for all the particles in the initial , final and any intermediate step of the cascade , are recorded for every event and any necessary distribution involving those quantities can be produced .      in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] momentum and angular distributions in the kinematic conditions of the ne18 experiment  @xcite for carbon are shown for events generated without fsi , i.e. in pwia . in all figures",
    "the solid line refers to @xmath19 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 , @xmath20 gev and the dashed line to @xmath21 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 , @xmath22 gev , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a at @xmath19 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 the momentum distribution @xmath23 of electrons is strongly peaked around 1.5 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 , while at @xmath21 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 it is much broader and extends over a range of roughly 2 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the main reason for this broadening is that at higher electron energies the spreading of the c.m .",
    "energy due to fermi motion is much more pronounced .",
    "in fig.[fig1]b the momentum distributions @xmath24 of final protons are presented .",
    "their shapes are qualitatively similar to those for electrons , they have , however , different positions of the maxima .",
    "the angular distributions of final electrons ( @xmath25 ) and protons ( @xmath26 ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]b , respectively .",

    "the inc model reproduces the expected spread of the angular distributions due to fermi motion .",
    "the angular distribution @xmath30 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for events corresponding to protons ejected out of the scattering plane .",
    "in fact , @xmath31 is the angle between the electron scattering plane and the plane defined by the momenta @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the emitted proton and the incident electron , respectively . if fermi motion would be absent , this distribution in the c.m . of the final system",
    "would be described by the delta function @xmath34 . on the contrary",
    ", the width of this distribution is determined by the ratio between the transverse component of the fermi momentum with respect to the scattering plane and @xmath32 . at larger @xmath4 , @xmath35 is larger and the distribution becomes narrower .",

    "the protons are emitted from carbon ; therefore , the dashed line corresponds to the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b on a smaller scale .",
    "as expected , the struck proton looses part of its momentum because of rescattering and pion production .",
    "consequently , fsi make the spectrum softer and move part of the strength to lower momenta .",
    "the effect is even more pronounced for gold ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .    in a very similar manner ,",
    "the same effect is evident also for the angular distributions of final protons scattered in plane ( @xmath26 ) and out of plane ( @xmath30 ) , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a and fig .",
    "[ fig5]b , respectively , for carbon and gold targets in the same conditions and with the same notations as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , except that the distribution is integrated over the interval @xmath36 gev/@xmath2 . in this case ,",
    "fsi redistribute the events over a wider angular range because of rescattering .",
    "experimental setups usually require kinematic cuts on momentum , angular and missing momentum / energy distributions .",
    "therefore , it is important to compare those distributions in cases where fsi are switched off and on for the same cuts .",
    "this can be done in the inc model in a natural way .",
    "the solid circles in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] describe the ratio @xmath37 between the distributions of events with and without fsi , that is actually equivalent to nt . in the range of angles around the maximum ,",
    "the ratio @xmath38 , integrated over the other variables , is approximately constant .",
    "for example , integrating over @xmath31 for carbon @xmath39 for @xmath40 and for gold @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , integrating over @xmath28 @xmath38 gets the same values for carbon and gold , respectively , in the range @xmath43 .",
    "this stability of @xmath38 over rather wide angular intervals suggests that it depends mainly on the nuclear density along the propagation trajectory of the struck proton .",
    "if the angular cuts would be performed inside the above indicated intervals , the size of @xmath38 would be almost independent of the specific choice of the cuts . as the angular distributions @xmath44 are broader than @xmath45 , the values of @xmath38 increase in the tail regions and have a large uncertainty at those angles , where the proton yield , calculated in pwia , is very small and the dominant contribution comes from rescattering .",
    "the version of the inc model here adopted can not give completely realistic distributions in missing momentum ( @xmath46 ) and missing energy ( @xmath47 ) , because it uses a spectral function corresponding to the fermi gas model .",
    "however it is instructive to analyse the @xmath48 dependence of the ratio @xmath38 in comparison with the one of the conventional glauber approach .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that , after integrating over the missing momentum @xmath49 transverse to the propagation axis , only the inelastic proton - nucleon cross section should contribute to the glauber multiple - scattering series , which describes the attenuation of the ejected proton flux .",
    "the argument is that the elastic cross section leads just to a broadening of the @xmath49 distribution while inelastic rescatterings suppress the ejectile flux at any @xmath49 , according to a mechanism similar to the gribov s inelastic shadowing  @xcite . since at @xmath50 the total proton - nucleon cross section contributes , in this framework nt",
    "is expected to be an increasing function with @xmath49 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a and fig .",
    "[ fig6]b the missing momentum distributions for carbon and gold targets are shown , respectively , at the same @xmath51 and with the same notations as in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the sign of @xmath48 , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , is defined positive ( negative ) when the angle of @xmath32 with respect to the incident beam is larger ( smaller ) than the angle of @xmath9 .",
    "the general trend is that , at least at relatively small outgoing proton angles , @xmath38 decreases with increasing @xmath52 ( and , therefore , @xmath53 ) , contrary to the previous expectations and in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite ( see , in particular , fig . 4 therein at angles corresponding to @xmath48 below the fermi momentum ) .",
    "a possible explanation ( confirmed and justified also in the framework of the ea , see sec .",
    "[ sec : output ] ) relies on the observation that struck protons with higher missing momenta mainly come from deeper zones inside the nucleus .",
    "therefore they must propagate through larger distances inside the nuclear medium before escaping towards the detector .    imposing a constraint on the range of explored missing momenta , as in the ne18 experiment  @xcite where @xmath54 mev/@xmath2 , could affect the previous argument based on the interference between elastic and inelastic channels .",
    "a quantitative estimate is possible in the inc model , where all particles can be tagged and recognized at each step during their propagation inside the nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , one can compute the number @xmath55 of events obtained according to the attenuation of the proton flux in the forward direction and the number @xmath56 of events where the protons fell into the detector acceptance coming from very different initial conditions due to elastic and inelastic rescatterings .",
    "two conditions were selected that correspond to @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( gev/@xmath2)@xmath3 in the ne18 experiment  @xcite , but no cuts were applied on @xmath48 ( see table[tabi ] ) .",
    "the kinematic restrictions for @xmath35 and @xmath31 are slightly softer than in the ne18 experiment  @xcite , but further checks at points with higher statistics have shown that the results are stable againts stronger cuts . as indicated in table  [ tabi ] ,",
    "the ratio @xmath59 is always small .",
    "therefore , under the conditions of the ne18 experiment  @xcite the fraction of indirect protons reaching the detector with large @xmath49 after elastic or inelastic rescattering is small .",
    "in exclusive @xmath60 reactions on nuclei , where the residual system is left in a well defined final state , the basic ingredient of the calculation is the scattering amplitude  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the nuclear charge - current density operator . the scattering wave function @xmath63 is the solution of a schrdinger equation involving an optical potential @xmath64 which effectively describes the interaction between the residual nucleus , recoiling with momentum @xmath65 and mass @xmath66 , and the outgoing proton , detected in the direction defined by @xmath67 .",
    "the proton bound state @xmath68 is the solution of an eigenvalue problem involving a single - particle local potential of the woods - saxon type , which also depends on the excitation energy @xmath69 of the residual nucleus corresponding to the proton removal from the shell with quantum numbers @xmath70 .",
    "since the kinetic energy of the residual nucleus is given by  @xcite @xmath71 also the missing energy of the reaction explicitly depends on the produced hole through the relation @xmath72 therefore , in the following , the complete dependence of the scattering amplitude on the bound - state quantum numbers @xmath70 is exploited by the notation @xmath73 .",
    "here our interest is on the properties of the scattering wave @xmath63 and the simplified picture is considered retaining just the longitudinal component @xmath74 to leading order @xmath75 of the nonrelativistic expansion .",
    "consequently , the cross section becomes proportional to  @xcite @xmath76 which is traditionally identified as the `` distorted '' spectral density @xmath77  @xcite at the missing energy @xmath78 of the residual nucleus with a hole with quantum numbers @xmath70 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the scattering state can be solved for each partial wave of @xmath79 up to a maximum angular momentum @xmath80 , which satisfies a convergence criterion .",
    "the boundary condition is such that each incoming partial wave coincides asymptotically with the corresponding component of the plane wave associated to @xmath35 .",
    "typically , this method has been successfully applied to @xmath60 scattering with proton momenta below 0.5 gev/@xmath2 and @xmath81 for a large variety of complex optical potentials , including also spin degrees of freedom  @xcite .    at higher energies",
    "the glauber method  @xcite suggests an alternative way ( based on the ea ) to solve the schrdinger equation by reducing it to a first - order differential equation along the propagation axis @xmath29 : @xmath82 the standard boundary condition requires that asymptotically @xmath83 corresponding to an incoming unitary flux of plane waves . by substituting the solution of eq .",

    "the ea , whose reliability is supposed to increase with increasing ejectile energy  @xcite , has been successfully tested  @xcite in the momentum range of interest here ( @xmath87 gev/@xmath2 ) against the solution of the schrdinger equation up to @xmath88 , as required by the mentioned convergence criterion .",
    "we adopt here the same simple woods - saxon form for the potential @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath89 where @xmath90 is normalized such that @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the nuclear diffuseness and @xmath93 fm .    at the considered proton momenta ,",
    "the elementary proton - nucleon scattering amplitude is dominated by inelastic processes and @xmath85 is supposed to be mostly sensitive to the imaginary well depth @xmath94  @xcite . however , no phenomenological phase - shift analysis is available beyond the inelastic threshold , which could constrain @xmath95 and @xmath94 .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere  @xcite that @xmath77 is rather clearly insensitive to the sign and magnitude of @xmath95 for different test values of @xmath96 , which justifies the choice @xmath97 , also here adopted .",
    "this choice does not contradict the glauber model , where the ratio @xmath98 should equal the ratio between the real and the imaginary parts of the average proton - nucleon forward - scattering amplitude , because this ratio is expected to be small anyway above the inelastic threshold  @xcite .    as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq : schroglau ] ) , the glauber approach predicts @xmath99 as far as the proton - nucleon total cross section ( and , consequently , the damping of the proton flux ) can be considered constant for different choices of @xmath100 , i.e. for small angles @xmath101 . however , in order to reproduce the ne18 data  @xcite , a smaller proportionality factor @xmath102 seems to be required with respect to the one indicated by the glauber model  @xcite . here",

    "the inc model describes the available data on nt up to @xmath125 gev@xmath3/@xmath126 rather well without the need of free parameters .",
    "our analysis shows that the pauli blocking seems to be the most crucial ingredient and suppresses the otherwise important interference between coherent and incoherent rescatterings  @xcite , while short - range correlations at such @xmath4 are less important .",
    "the results of the inc model are also in qualitative agreement with those obtained in the ea .    in this framework",
    ", the @xmath4 behaviour of nt can be interpreted as a kinematic effect related to the fact that for each @xmath4 different ranges of missing proton momentum are explored according to the experimental setup .",
    "in fact , because in the ea the definition of nt is based on a genuine exclusive cross section , at each @xmath4 it is possible to analyse the angular distribution not only of nt , but also of the contribution of each single target shell .",
    "it turns out that nt at small proton angles is due to the emission from @xmath118 shells , while at larger angles shells with higher angular momentum are important .",
    "the different fsi make nt a decreasing function of the proton angle ( or , equivalently , of the transverse missing momentum @xmath49 ) and large variations of the nt coefficient are possible within the presently available experimental angular acceptance .",
    "the relative angular contribution of each shell depends on @xmath49 .",
    "if the range of explored @xmath49 is kept constant , the transparency coefficient , integrated over the proton angles , does not show any @xmath4 dependence",
    ".    in the kinematic conditions presently investigated nuclear transparency seems under control . in order to test the onset of other transparency mechanisms as a function of @xmath4",
