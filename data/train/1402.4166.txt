    "the full story of the radio galaxy centaurus a is still not known , despite much careful study over the years .",
    "cen a is of course worth study for its own sake , but it also provides a nearby , well - documented example from which we can understand the dynamic evolution of other , similar radio galaxies . in this paper",
    "i focus on two unresolved questions related to cen a s large - scale radio lobes .",
    "the first question is the age of cen a. to answer this we need to understand the physical state of its radio lobes .",
    "so - called fanaroff - riley type ii ( `` frii '' ) radio galaxies are well understood : a collimated , supersonic jet develops a terminal shock where it impacts the ambient medium .",
    "the shock is apparent as an outer hot spot , and jet plasma which has been through the shock is left behind as a cocoon .",
    "ram pressure drives the growth of the source , as the end of the jet advances into the ambient medium .",
    "however , cen a is not an frii , but a fanaroff - riley type i ( `` fri '' ; implicitly defined these days as any radio galaxy that is not an frii ) .",
    "no robust models exist yet for the dynamics and development of fri sources .",
    "the inner jets in some fri s have been modelled as turbulent , entraining flows , but that model does not address the variety of fri morphologies , nor does it describe the history and growth of such a source .",
    "more work is needed before we can understand the dynamics of fri sources .",
    "the second question is how cen a keeps shining long past the radiative lifetimes of its radio - loud and @xmath0-ray loud electrons . in this paper",
    "i discuss three alternative dynamical models which may describe cen a. all of these models require the source to be quite old , with an age between several hundred myr to more than a gyr .",
    "this age range is much longer than the electrons radiative lifetimes , which range from a few to a few tens of myr .",
    "it follows that the radiative lifetimes are not a good indicator of the age of the source ; in situ reacceleration ( isr ) must be ongoing within the large radio lobes .",
    "thus , cen a provides a nearby case study of isr in radio galaxies .    to address these questions",
    ", i begin in section [ basicstuff ] by describing the setting and collecting important facts to be used in the analysis . in section [ internalconditions ]",
    "i review observational constraints on plasma and magnetic field within the outer lobes .",
    "i argue that inhomogeneous models , containing both strong and weak fields , are physically likely and consistent with the data . in section [ modelsthatdontwork ] i show that the short radiative lifetimes require isr ; models fail which try to grow the source so quickly . in section [ modelsthatwork ]",
    "i present three alternative dynamic models",
    " buoyant , magnetic tower and flow - driven  each of which requires the source age to be on the order of a gyr .",
    "the buoyant model does not fare well when compared to the data but both the flow - driven and magnetically - driven models seem consistent with current observations . in section [ insitureacceleration ]",
    "i critique competing isr models .",
    "i speculate that alfven - wave isr is operating throughout the lobes and probably maintains the @xmath0-ray - loud electrons , while the radio - loud electrons are energized by shock or reconnection isr in high - field regions within the source .",
    "finally in section [ conclusions ] i summarize my arguments and discuss what this exercise reveals about the astrophysics of cen a. i relegate necessary but tedious details to the appendices .",
    "cen a s parent galaxy , ngc 5128 , is the dominant galaxy in a small group of galaxies .",
    "it hosts a massive black hole which is currently active , and must have been so for most of the past gyr .",
    "the plasma driven out by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) has created the large radio galaxy which we see today .",
    "cen a is perhaps best known by its large - scale , double - lobed radio source , extending @xmath1 on the sky , or 540 kpc end - to - end in projection ( using 3.8 mpc distance ; harris 2010 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : outerlobes ] .",
    "these outer lobes have been called giant lobes in the literature , but they are not unusually large compared to other double - lobed radio galaxies .",
    "i therefore drop the `` giant '' and just call them `` outer lobes '' or `` radio lobes '' .",
    "the outer lobes have been detected in radio from 5 mhz to 5 ghz ( , alvarez 2000 ) , and recent wmap images detect the outer lobes up to 60 ghz ( hardcastle 2009 , `` h09 '' ) . while generally similar , the radio structures of the north and south outer lobes differ in detail .",
    "the north lobe is straighter ( extending @xmath2 kpc in projection ) , while the south lobe broadens and bends .",
    "the outer lobes are also clearly detected as extended @xmath0-ray sources ( abdo 2010 , `` a10 '' ) , interpreted as inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of photons from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "when numbers are needed i illustrate with the north lobe .",
    "the angle @xmath3 by which the north lobe deviates from the sky plane is unknown ; i keep @xmath4 as a parameter .",
    "the width of the north lobe is also uncertain .",
    "although relatively narrow at high radio frequencies ( , junkes 1993 ) , recent data suggest that it is broader when seen in low radio frequencies ( paper data at 148 mhz from stefan 2013 ; mwa data at 118 mhz from mckinley 2013 ) and even broader when seen at @xmath0-rays ( recent _ fermi_-lat data from yang 2012 , `` y12 '' ) .",
    "based on these data i treat the north lobe as a cylinder , with length @xmath5 kpc , and diameter @xmath6 kpc .",
    "the geometry of the south lobe is less clear ; it may be a broader ovoid , or it may be a longer structure seen in projection .      in the past few myr",
    "the agn in ngc 5128 has created a bipolar inner radio lobe structure , @xmath7 kpc end to end ( in projection ) .",
    "estimates of the power currently being supplied by the agn to each side of the radio source range from @xmath8 erg / s to @xmath9 erg / s ( croston 2009 , wykes 2013 , neff 2014 ) .    although cen a is typical of the general radio galaxy population on large and small scales  both showing bipolar radio lobes ",
    "it is atypical on the transition scales ( @xmath10 kpc ) .",
    "no radio jets have been detected connecting the inner and outer radio lobes .",
    "a previous suggestion of a weak jet extending to ne ( morganti 1999 ) is not supported by newer data ( neff 2014 ) .",
    "the large angular size of cen a makes direct x - ray measurements of the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) challenging . on small scales",
    " probably representative of the inner part of the igm surrounding cen a  kraft ( 2009 ) modelled x - rays from a @xmath11-kpc region surrounding ngc5128 as coming from a sphere with density @xmath12@xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 kev .    to characterize the igm on larger scales",
    ", we must look for analogs among other galaxy groups and poor clusters .",
    "cen a sits in a small group of galaxies ( karachentsev 2007 ) with gravitating mass @xmath15 .",
    "the group is comparable to , but a bit smaller than , other galaxy groups and poor clusters for which good x - ray data is available .",
    "the temperature of the igm has been measured , typically at @xmath16 kev , for quite a few similar galaxy groups ( e.g. , finoguenov 2006 , sun 2009 ) .",
    "when temperature structure can be resolved , the igm tends to be cooler in the core , rising to @xmath17 kev by @xmath18 kpc . determining the density of the igm in faint , irregular galaxy groups is harder .",
    "doe ( 1995 ) studied several poor clusters , a few times more massive than the cen a cluster but of comparable size .",
    "they found the igm density @xmath193 inside @xmath18 kpc , falling off @xmath20 at larger radii .",
    "thus it seems likely that the igm around most of the outer lobes in cen a is less dense than the estimate from kraft ( 2009 ) for the inner region of ngc5128 , perhaps @xmath213 ( see also discussion in osullivan 2013 ) .",
    "this estimate for the igm density differs from that of bouchard ( 2007 ) , who searched for hi in 18 galaxies in the cen a group .",
    "they detected hi in some but not all galaxies , and ascribed the non - detections to stripping by the igm , suggesting @xmath223 .",
    "however , following the basic stripping argument of gunn and gott ( 1972 ) with the galaxy properties assumed by bouchard , it is easy to show that a typical galaxy will be stripped by any igm density @xmath233 .    putting these results together",
    ", i will scale the igm density around the outer lobes of cen a to @xmath243 , the temperature to 1 kev , and estimate the igm pressure as @xmath25 dyn-@xmath26 . the likely density decay in the igm between 100 and 300 kpc means @xmath27 is probably a bit higher around the inner part of the radio lobes , and a bit lower around the outer part .",
    "in order to evaluate models of the outer lobes , we must understand their internal state .",
    "our diagnostics are radio and @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "gamma rays detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat from the outer lobes of cen a are a direct probe of highly relativistic electrons in the outer lobes .",
    "electron energies @xmath28 are needed to make @xmath0-rays at @xmath29 mev @xmath30 gev by ics on the cmb .",
    "radio emission detected from cen a is a separate , less direct , probe of the plasma and magnetic field in the lobes .",
    "synchrotron emission maps the electron energy to a photon energy , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 ( pacholczyk 1970 ; noting the maximum of the @xmath33 synchrotron kernel is at @xmath34 ) .",

    "we know , of course , that the outer lobes of cen a do not resemble the turbulent , entraining plumes which some authors ( , bicknell 1984 , deyoung 1986 ) have suggested as models for tailed radio galaxies .",
    "the outer lobes do not show the gradual broadening , going away from the source , which is characteristic of such plumes . nor is there any sign of the lateral spreading expected if the end of a plume has reached the neutral buoyancy level in the surrounding igm .",
    "however , the growth of the outer lobes may still be dominated by bouyancy if the buoyant force exceeds ram pressure force at the end of the lobe .",
    "there is not much work in the fluid literature describing the advance speed of the end of a driven buoyant plume , but we can estimate an upper limit . we know that the speed at which a small buoyant bubble rises through an atmosphere",
    "is determined by the balance of buoyant and drag forces .",
    "if the ambient medium is hydrostatic , in the gravity of the galaxy group , it is easy to show that this buoyant rise speed is no larger than the sound speed in the external medium , and very likely much less .",
    "we can speculate that a similar limit applies to the buoyancy - dominated end of a continuous plume , so that the end advances into the igm at @xmath217 .",
    "thus , the age of a bouyancy - driven radio lobe will be at least as long as @xmath204 , and probably longer .",
    "the internal state of a buoyancy - driven radio lobe is probably close to the homogeneous models of section [ combinesyics ] .",
    "nothing in the model calls for large - scale spatial gradients .",

    "although some plasma flow can be included in a classic magnetic tower , the energy is mostly carried by poynting flux ( lynden - bell 1996 , li 2001 ) .",
    "numerical models of magnetic towers propagating into an ambient igm ( , nakamura 2006 ) show a magnetically dominated interior , with the field close to a force - free configuration .",
    "as the tower grows , it comes into lateral pressure balance with the igm ; hoop stresses concentrate the field toward the axis and maintain lateral collimation , while allowing vertical growth as the front end advances into the igm ( , uzdensky and macfadyen 2006 ) .",
    "both analytic models and simulations show the end advances at @xmath211 into the igm ( lynden - bell 1996 , nakamura 2006 ) .",
    "the growth rate of other self - organized models , such as those suggested by tang ( 2008 ) or benford and protheroe ( 2008 ) has not been worked out , but we might guess that such structures develop similarly to magnetic towers .    because the internal state of a magnetically self - organized radio lobe includes large - scale gradients in both the b field strength and the plasma density , these models are among the inhomogeneous - field models discussed in section [ alternativemodels ] .",
    "if organized plasma flow from the agn continues to the end of the outer lobes , ram pressure can dominate the growth of the lobe and grow the source faster than bouyancy or magnetic pressure .",
    "a simple model can illustrate this idea , which i summarize here ; details are given in [ appendix : toy_model ] .",
    "assume a channel flowing within each radio lobe carries all of the energy and momentum to drive the lobe .",
    "at the outer end of the lobe  which advances less rapidly than the speed of the plasma within the channel  that plasma must slow down and move aside .",
    "the channel will therefore be surrounded with a `` cocoon '' which acts as a reservoir for mass and energy from the channel .",
    "this cocoon is the observed radio lobe .",
    "this model derives , of course , from standard models of frii radio sources , but must be modified to agree with the lack of strong outer hot spots in fri sources .",
    "the model has two important parts , as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the advance speed of the end , @xmath218 , is governed by momentum conservation , where the outer end of the channel impacts the igm . the momentum flux carried by the channel",
    "will be spread over an area ( @xmath219 ) at least as large as the area of the channel ( @xmath220 ) , and possibly larger .",
    "if the channel impacts the end of the lobe with density @xmath221 and speed @xmath222 , @xmath218 is governed by @xmath223 ( [ ws_advance_speed_short ] , [ limiting_forms ] ) .",
    "if the lobe and igm are also in pressure balance , and the end propagates supersonically into the igm , the channel flow must be _ internally _ transonic : @xmath224 ( [ mach_number_relation ] , [ limiting_forms ] ) .",
    "the lower limits on @xmath222 and @xmath225 obtain when @xmath226 ; if the momentum flux is spread over a larger impact area , the advance speed @xmath218 is correspondingly lower .",
    "\\(2 ) the flow power in the channel , @xmath227 , can be found directly from energy conservation , if we account for growth of the lobe volume and work done on the igm .",
    "this calculation depends on the aspect ratio @xmath228 of the lobe : if the lobe grows self - similarly , with @xmath228 remaining constant , more power is required to grow the lobe at a given @xmath218 than if the lobe radius @xmath229 remains constant .",
    "i parameterize this uncertainty with a factor @xmath230 , describing the range from constant - radius growth to self - similar growth .",
    "the general result for @xmath227 , , contains two terms : one describing the growth of the full lobe , and an additional factor describing the extra power needed to maintain the channel flow . as with the advance speed ,",
    "the result @xmath227 depends on the working surface area , @xmath219 .",
