    "a recent paper @xcite introduced the idea of using a sheet comprising two lenslet ( or microlens ) arrays to mimic refraction .",
    "the two lenslet arrays have to share the same focal plane : they are confocal .",
    "the basis of this idea is that the equations describing the light - ray - direction change due to confocal lenslet arrays ( clas ) and refraction due to refractive - index interfaces are very similar : in the former , the angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 with which a light ray respectively enters and exits a cla sheet ( fig .  [ lens - figure ] ) are related through the equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is minus the ratio of the focal lengths of the two lenslet arrays @xcite ; in the latter , the angle of incidence in a medium with refractive index @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and the angle of refraction in a medium with refractive index @xmath4 , @xmath7 , are related through snell s law , @xmath10 for small angles , when @xmath11 , the equation describing the light - ray - direction change due to clas ( eqn ( [ tan - equation ] ) ) is the same as snell s law , whereby @xmath12    for larger angles , eqn ( [ tan - equation ] ) is different from snell s law ; it does , for example , not lead to total internal reflection .",
    "however , it could be argued that the light - ray - direction change according to eqn ( [ tan - equation ] ) is better than refraction due to snell s law , in the sense that it has the following remarkable imaging property : a planar cla sheet images all space with transverse magnification one and longitudinal magnification @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "( in contrast , a planar refractive - index interface described by snell s law images all of space only if @xmath14 ; in all other cases , it images only approximately . ) fig .  [ etas - figure ] shows an object seen through cla sheets for different values of @xmath13 , demonstrating the apparently different distance of the object behind the cla sheets due to the longitudinal magnification ,  @xmath13 .",
    "cla sheets are examples of metatoys ( maerials fr light ras ) @xcite .",
    "other metatoys include generalizations of clas @xcite and combinations of dove - prism sheets @xcite .",
    "the name stems from a number of similarities with metamaterials @xcite , for example structural similarities ( both metamaterials and metatoys are arrays of small elements ) and ray - optical negative refraction @xcite , that is , negative refraction without negative group velocity @xcite or amplification of evanescent waves required for the sub - wavelength imaging properties of superlenses @xcite and hyperlenses @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the light - ray - direction change due to passage through metatoys is called _ metarefraction _ ; considering the close similarity between eqns ( [ tan - equation ] ) and ( [ snell - equation ] ) , this seems appropriate enough .",

    "the origin for this `` leakage '' is not completely clear , but one possible reason could be the fact that in the simulations for fig .  [ etas - with - critical - angles - figure ] , the apertures of corresponding lenslets were not separated exactly by the sum of the lenslets focal lengths .",
    "this is due to the fact that corresponding lenslets are set up such that the centers of their outside surfaces were separated by the sum of the lenslets focal lengths , but because the lenslet surfaces are curved , the edges of corresponding lenslets  the effective apertures  were separated by a slightly different distance . in the simulations ,",
    "this separation is within less than 1% of the lens - center separation .",
    "the light dimming due to non - standard metarefraction of the second kind is not represented at all in our ray - tracing simulations .",
    "this can be understood by the following argument which considers the light from an arbitrary small part of the chess piece s surface that subsequently passes through a specific lenslet in the first lenslet array .",
    "physically , for given lighting conditions the power of this light is fixed ; losing any of the power leads to dimming .",
    "exactly such loss of power happens for angles above the second critical angles , as represented by the dotted light rays in the cases @xmath28 and @xmath31 in fig .  [",
    "normal - incidence - figure ] : such light rays get refracted into the wrong angle of metarefraction , and are lost from the correct angle of metarefraction ( in the case of fig .  [ normal - incidence - figure ] , @xmath82 ) .",
    "however , if the solid light rays are traced backwards , none of the light appears lost in any way , so this particular dimming is consequently not represented .",
    "( perhaps it is helpful to look at this in the following , slightly different , way .",
    "the solid area in fig .  [ normal - incidence - figure ] can be seen as the standard - refracted _",
    "beam_. in those cases where dotted light rays occur , namely @xmath28 and @xmath31 , the beam diameter is smaller as it enters the first lenslet compared to when it leaves the second lenslet .",
    "this means that the power contained in the beam gets spread across a larger area , which should lead to a reduction in intensity . )",
    "the effect of non - standard metarefraction of the first kind _ is _ represented in fig .",
    "[ etas - with - critical - angles - figure ] , but its effect is far less obvious than that of the third critical angles .",
    "the effect of the lenslet arrays square symmetry obscures the effect further , for example in the frames corresponding to @xmath90 and @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , the dashed circle ( which represent the first critical angles of metarefraction ) arguably gives an indication of the size of the clear circle in the center of each frames , most notably for @xmath90 and @xmath23 .",
    "this paper starts to study optical imperfections of generalized cla sheets , specifically light passing through non - corresponding lenslets , which leads to non - standard metarefraction .",
    "the formulae that were derived for the critical angles contain only the focal lengths of the lenslets and the radius of each lenslet .",
    "they therefore provide a clear guide on what needs to be done to increase the field of view .",
    "however , it should be noted that an increase in the radius of each lenslet aperture without a corresponding increase in the focal length increases the angle at which light rays travel , and with it aberrations , unless great care is taken in the lens design . therefore the field of view needs to be traded off against imaging quality .",
    "several questions remain . in this paper",
    "only the simplest generalized clas were studied , so it is natural to examine the critical angles for more complex , generalized , clas @xcite .",
    "similarly , little is known about the field of view of the closely related dove - prism sheets @xcite , and of combinations of dove - prism sheets that perform negative metarefraction @xcite and light - ray rotation  @xcite .",
