    "extreme environmental events , such as hurricanes , heatwaves , flooding and droughts , can cause havoc to the people affected and typically result in large financial losses .",
    "the impact of this type of event is often exacerbated by the event being severe over a large spatial region .",
    "the statistical modelling of spatial extremes is a rapidly evolving area @xcite and is crucial to understanding , visualizing and predicting the extremes of stochastic processes .",
    "the approach that is currently most used for modelling spatial extreme values assumes the environmental process is a max - stable process @xcite .",
    "the most widely used max - stable processes are the smith @xcite , brown - resnick @xcite , the extremal gaussian @xcite , and the extremal-@xmath0 @xcite processes .",
    "max - stable processes are the only non - trivial limit of point - wise normalised maxima of independent and identically distributed realisations of a stochastic processes .",
    "when max - stable processes are observed at a finite number of locations their joint distribution is a multivariate extreme value distribution ,  which is underpinned by the assumption of the original variables satisfying the dependence structure conditions of multivariate regular variation @xcite .",
    "max - stable processes have marginal generalised extreme value distributions @xcite and a complex non - negative dependence structure which has a restricted form .  to understand this restriction ,",
    "let @xmath1 be a spatial max - stable process with continuous marginal distribution functions @xmath2 and corresponding inverse denoted by @xmath3.then , if for any @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not independent , it follows that the dependence coefficient @xmath7 is positive .",
    "this property is termed asymptotic dependence ;  for max - stable processes it implies that the spatial properties of extreme events are independent of the severity of the event @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced the class of inverted max - stable processes and these are used in @xcite .  any inverted max - stable process @xmath8 with unit exponential margins , i.e. , for all @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 ,",
    "can be represented by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a max - stable process with unit frchet margins , i.e. , for all @xmath14 and @xmath10 , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , for all @xmath16 , the dependence structure between large @xmath17 and @xmath18 is equivalent to the dependence structure between small @xmath19 and @xmath20 and hence differs from the max - stable form .",
    "all non - perfectly dependent inverted max - stable processes are in the domain of attraction of spatially independent max - stable processes ( see section [ sec : ms_and_ims ] ) , meaning that their point - wise normalised maxima are independent , i.e. , for all @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 for any @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 denotes a sequence of independent and identically distributed inverted max - stable processes with unit exponential margins .    to reveal the extremal dependence structure for asymptotically independent random variables , alternative asymptotic properties need to be studied .",
    "@xcite and @xcite explore the joint tail through the limiting joint survivor function , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , known as the coefficient of tail dependence , and @xmath29 is a slowly varying function at @xmath30 , are selected so that @xmath31 ,  and the dependence structure revealed by limit   is known as hidden regular variation .",
    "a weakness with this approach is that it fails to describe the behaviour of the @xmath18 values that occur with the largest values of @xmath17 .",
    "instead a conditioned approach is required which looks at a more subtle normalisation for @xmath18 that focuses on the region of the joint distribution which is most likely when conditioning on variable @xmath17 being large .",
    "this is the approach we take in this paper .    for a bivariate random variable @xmath32 with unit exponential margins and general dependence structure the conditioned extremes limit theory of @xcite and @xcite",
    "is equivalent to the assumption that there exist location and scaling norming functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , such that , for any @xmath10 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a non - degenerate distribution function .  to ensure @xmath38,@xmath39 and @xmath37",

    "@xmath55.however ,  this is not relevant for inverted max - stable processes as they are non - negatively dependent .",
    "a key question is why have we made the restriction of unit exponential margins on the inverted max - stable process .  in the style of copula methods",
    "@xcite we assume identical margins .",
    "conditioned limit theory has studied limiting presentation with the margins @xmath32 taken as identically distributed gumbel variables @xcite ,  which is asymptotically equivalent to unit exponential margins but mathematically less clean ,  whereas @xcite take identically distributed generalised pareto distributions .",
    "in contrast @xcite work with @xmath56 in the domain of attraction of the generalised extreme value distribution distribution , but do not impose any constraint on @xmath57 , and find that it is not always possible to achieve an affine normalisation as in limit   after marginal transformation to identical margins .",
    "@xcite consider @xmath32 with margins that have regularly varying tails ,  with location function @xmath58 .  through the paper we also find that for broad and important classes of inverted max - stable processes , it is possible to achieve affine normalisations after transformation to identical exponential marginal variables .",
    "furthermore , for some of these classes of inverted max - stable distributions limit   does not hold with margins that have regularly varying tails but holds with unit exponential margins.thus our restriction to unit exponential margins provides all the necessary ground work for deriving conditioned limits with any marginal distributions for inverted max - stable processes .  in section  [ sec : exp_scale ]",
    "we discuss the implications of the marginal choice , and in particular show how once the limit relationship has been derived for unit exponential margins alternative limit results follow immediately for other marginal choices .",
    "canonical family  ( [ eq : ht_class ] ) has been subject of criticism @xcite since the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 seem to be ` proof by example ' rather than a general result .  @xcite note that under assumption ( [ eq : cond_rep ] ) and in unit exponential marginals , @xmath59 for any @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are real functions .",
    "for the canonical family  ( [ eq : ht_class ] ) , it readily follows that @xmath63 if @xmath64 and @xmath65 if @xmath49 and this condition is also satisfied by a range of regularly varying functions .",
    "however , no examples have been published to date other than the canonical form  ( [ eq : ht_class ] ) .    for simplicity",
    "we focus on bivariate characterisations of the inverted max - stable process ,  with all joint distributions following inverted bivariate extreme value distributions .",
    "for the rest of the paper we denote by @xmath32 a bivariate random variable with inverted bivariate extreme value distribution with unit exponential margins and derive @xmath38 ,  @xmath39 and @xmath37 .",
    "we find classes of this family where the normalisation required to achieve property  ( [ eq : cond_rep ] ) either falls in the canonical family  ( [ eq : ht_class ] ) or a more general form is required .",
    "examples of the former include the inverted max - stable models with schlather @xcite and extremal-@xmath0 @xcite dependence models , and the latter include inverted max - stable model with smith @xcite dependence model .",
    "we show that the distinction between these classes is determined by the behaviour of the spectral measure of the underlying max - stable process near its lower end point .",
    "the statistical conditioned model of @xcite assumes that the limiting relationship  ( [ eq : cond_rep ] ) holds exactly for all values @xmath66 for a suitably high threshold @xmath67 with the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 in canonical form  ( [ eq : ht_class ] ) .",
    "this model has been found to fit well in various applications @xcite .",
    "our identification of the existence of the new classes that do not fall in canonical family  ( [ eq : ht_class ] ) questions the validity of the generic use of the canonical family for statistical modelling.therefore ,  we compare the new models with the current statistical approach of @xcite and show ,  through simulation ,  that at practical levels ,  that the use of canonical family gives good approximations to the conditional distribution of the inverted max - stable model with smith dependence and highlight examples where a good approximation does not hold .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .  in section  [ sec : inverted_models ] we present the classes of max - stable and inverted max - stable distributions and explore the implications of deriving results on general margins .  in section  [ sec : new_examples ] we present the conditional representation of the class of inverted max - stable distributions with spectral densities of the associated max - stable process being regularly varying and @xmath68-varying spectral densities at their lower end - point .  in section  [ sec :",
    "spatial ] we discuss the spatial extension of our results .",
    "our derivations and proofs are included in the appendix .",
    "max - stable distributions arise naturally as the only non - degenerate limit distributions of appropriately normalised component - wise maxima of random vectors .  in unit frchet margins , and for @xmath69 ,",

    "as the class of bivariate max - stable distributions does not admit a finite dimensional parameterisation , a natural method for modelling the spectral measure @xmath72 of expression  ( [ eq : max_stable ] ) relies on constructing parametric sub - classes of models that are flexible enough to approximate any member from the class @xcite .",
    "two such sub - models are @xcite and @xcite max - stable distributions which have exponent measures , for @xmath83 ,    rcl & v(x , y)=\\ { + ( ) } + \\ { + ( ) } ( 0 , ) , [ eq : hr_model ] +   + & v(x , y)= ( + ) ( -1,1 ) , & [ eq : schl_model ]    respectively , where @xmath84 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution .",
    "these are the exponent measures of the pairwise distributions for the smith and schlather max - stable models respectively .  the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 control the strength of dependence .  in particular ,",
    "increasing and decreasing values of @xmath86 and @xmath85 , respectively , imply stronger dependence between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "given a max - stable distribution with exponent measure @xmath71 as in equation  ( [ eq : max_stable ] ) , the bivariate random variable @xmath32 follows the inverted max - stable distribution with unit exponential margins if , for @xmath83 , its joint survivor function is , @xmath87 as @xmath88,\\ ] ] the inverted max - stable distributions are either perfectly dependent when @xmath89 or asymptotically independent when @xmath90.specifically @xmath91 is the coefficient of tail dependence @xcite .",
    "this property explains the independence in limit  .",
    "a range of results are available to study the conditional limit  .",
    "in particular , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite show that under various conditions , all of the followings limits are identical to @xmath92 in limit  : @xmath93 these conditions hold for all inverted max - stable distributions if the associated spectral measure of the max - stable process places no point mass on the interval @xmath78 ,  i.e. ,  when @xmath32 have a joint density .",
    "so we can use any of these limits to derive the forms of @xmath94 and @xmath37 .  motivated by statistical considerations , we find that the use the last expression is most simple to use",
    ".  however ,  this is the most restrictive in general as it requires the assumption of a joint density .",
    "as all the parametric max - stable models have joint densities so do the associated inverted max - stable distributions , so for us this is not restrictive .  for using this third limit form",
    "it is helpful to note that the conditional survivor function is @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a bivariate random variable with common unit exponential margins and assume that limit   holds.here we consider what this representation then implies for the extremal conditioned distribution of @xmath97 , where the bivariate random variable @xmath98 has continuous marginal distribution functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively and has identical copula to @xmath32 .  for @xmath101 ,  let @xmath102 for @xmath103 and denote its inverse by @xmath104 for @xmath105 .  then @xmath106 have the required joint distribution and from limit   there exist functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 such that for all @xmath109 @xmath110\\mid x_{h_1 } >      u\\right)=g(z ) \\label{eq : different}\\ ] ] for non - degenerate @xmath92 .",
    "therefore ,  if we can find a location - scale normalisation when working with identical unit exponential margins then limit   shows that these results directly provide the appropriate conditioned limit for non - identically distributed marginals .",
    "furthermore , limit   shows that in general margins a location - scale normalisation is not always possible even when it can be achieved with unit exponential margins .",
    "of course the converse is true , but as we will see in section  [ sec : new_examples ] for the class of inverted max - stable distributions limit   holds with unit exponential margins , so limit   is useful to give the conditioned limits in other marginals .    to help understand the implications of limit   it is helpful to focus on specific forms for on @xmath99 and @xmath100.@xcite present limit   with identically distributed generalised pareto distributions.@xcite work with regularly varying tails .",
