    "in recent years there has been considerable interest in topological phases of band insulators , fuelled by their theoretical prediction @xcite and subsequent experimental realization @xcite in two and three dimensional time - reversal invariant systems . on the theoretical side",
    "the obvious question arose : under what circumstances ( dimensions , symmetries , ... ) do topological phases occur ?",
    "for the case of free fermions , a partial answer was given in the seminal paper @xcite using @xmath3-theory , the result of which is displayed in table  [ periodic ] ( the `` periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors '' ) .",
    "it is only a partial answer , since it has a major limitation : it is assumed that the number of occupied as well as empty energy bands is large enough for @xmath3-theory to apply . in this",
    "_ stable regime _ , it can be shown using @xmath3-theory  @xcite that invariants defined for a torus @xmath4 as momentum space factorize into a product of @xmath5 independent invariants over @xmath6 , where @xmath7 runs from @xmath8 to @xmath0 and table  [ periodic ] shows the answer for each @xmath7 .",
    "we give an alternative , homotopy theoretic derivation of this result .",
    "the factorization of the invariants in the stable regime leads to a natural definition of _ strong _ topological insulators as those insulators that have a non - trivial invariant in the factor with domain @xmath9 , while the remaining insulators are dubbed _ weak _ topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "this distinction , which we refer to as definition ( i ) , becomes problematic in the non - stable regime . in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative definition of strong / weak topological insulators ( definition ( ii ) ) , which defines a topological insulator to be strong only if it has a non - trivial invariant over @xmath9 _ and all other invariants in the product are trivial _ , while all remaining insulators are called weak .",
    "the additional restriction is necessary in order to guarantee strong topological insulators to be `` truly @xmath0-dimensional '' .",
    "we demonstrate this by providing an example in the non - stable regime which is strong according to definition ( i ) , but can be realized by stacking lower - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "the latter can not happen for definition ( ii ) .",
    "after formalising the notion of stacking insulators , we further demonstrate through an example in the stable regime that for both definitions , there may be weak topological insulators that can not be realized through stacking .",
    "in other words , there may be also be `` truly @xmath0-dimensional '' weak topological insulators .    in order for definition ( ii ) to be well - defined , we prove that distinct phases over a sphere as momentum space always remain distinct over the torus with the same dimension as momentum space . by a straightforward generalization , we show that they also always remain distinct over any product of sphere and torus with the same ( total ) dimension , which provides a rigorous justification for the replacement @xmath10 in  @xcite , where invariants for topological insulators in @xmath11 dimensions with a defect of codimension @xmath12 are calculated .    in this paper",
    ", we use the natural notion of homotopy ( also known as adiabatic or continuous deformation ) as an equivalence relation between insulator ground states .",
    "this generalizes two definitions of topological insulators in the current literature : the first one is based on @xmath3-theory and the generalization is the extension to the non - stable regime .",
    "the second definition , as adopted in @xcite , defines an insulator to have non - trivial topology if there is no adiabatic deformation to the atomic limit , where fermions are localized at lattice points . while this second definition already uses the notion of homotopy (= adiabatic deformation ) , it only distinguishes non - trivial from trivial and is generalized here by additionally distinguishing between different non - trivial insulators .",
    "a translation invariant free fermion ground state of an insulator in one of the two `` complex '' symmetry classes ( upper two rows in table  [ periodic ] ) is described by a map @xmath13 where @xmath4 is the brillouin zone torus and @xmath14 is either a grassmannian gr@xmath15 for even  @xmath16 ( class a ) describing an @xmath17-band model with @xmath18 filled bands , or a unitary group @xmath19 for odd @xmath16 describing a @xmath20-band model with @xmath17 filled bands in the chiral class aiii . a ground state in one of the eight `` real '' classes ( eight lower rows in table  [ periodic ] )",
    "satisfies the additional requirement @xmath21 restricting the image at time reversal invariant momenta to the space @xmath22 ( see table  [ periodic ] ) .",
    "an equivalent formulation of condition   is to say that @xmath23 is _ equivariant _ with respect to the @xmath24-actions given by @xmath25 on @xmath4 and @xmath26 on @xmath14",
    ". a detailed description of all @xmath14 , @xmath22 and @xmath26 can be found in  @xcite .",

    "the involution on @xmath9 and @xmath14 is trivial , while in the real case , it is non - trivial with fixed point sets @xmath30 and @xmath22 respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a topological phase in this setting is an equivalence class of ground state maps @xmath23 , denoted @xmath31 $ ] . in this paper",
    ", we use the equivalence relation of being homotopic , i.e. having a continuous interpolation respecting the additional equivariance condition   in the real cases .",
    "the set of all topological phases in @xmath0 dimensions will be denoted @xmath32 $ ] for the complex classes and @xmath32_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}$ ] for the real ones .",
    "we will mainly use the latter since it includes the former as the special case with trivial @xmath24-action on @xmath4 and @xmath14 , which is automatically equivariant .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , this definition of a topological phase refines two definitions given in the current literature .",
    "one of them views an insulator ground state as a vector bundle of occupied eigenstates ( of a hamiltonian ) over the brillouin zone and defines equivalence classes through the notion of isomorphism of vector bundles  @xcite .",
    "these bundles may be constructed using pullback under @xmath23 ( the _ classifying map _ ) of the tautological bundle over the grassmannian . if there is no isomorphism between the vector bundles associated to two ground state maps @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", then there is no homotopy between them , i.e. @xmath35\\ne[\\psi_1]$ ] , but the converse is only true for a large number of empty bands ( large  @xmath36 ) .",
    "the equivalence relation of isomorphisms of vector bundles is relaxed further when going to @xmath3-theory , where the equivalence relation called _ stable equivalence _ only requires isomorphism of vector bundles up to direct sums with arbitrary trivial bundles  @xcite . here",
    ", two vector bundles that represent different stable equivalence classes in @xmath3-theory are in particular not isomorphic , but the converse is only true for large bundle dimensions ( large number @xmath18 of occupied bands ) .",
    "therefore , the notion of homotopy classes refines that of isomorphism classes of vector bundles , which in turn refines that of stable equivalence in @xmath3-theory .",
    "note that the intermediate step of considering isomorphism classes of vector bundles is limited to classes a , aii and ai where we have two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath17 ( see table  [ periodic ] ) .",
    "the other definition of topological phases  @xcite uses the atomic limit as a reference ground state , which corresponds to a constant map @xmath23 .",
    "it defines an insulator ground state to have non - trivial topology if there exists no adiabatic deformation to the atomic limit .",
    "this translates to no homotopy existing to the constant map . using homotopy as an equivalence relation also refines this definition since it additionally distinguishes between different non - trivial states .",
    "we note here that the notion of homotopy is natural in that it is the direct mathematical formalization of the physical concept of `` adiabatically connecting '' : two ground states can be adiabatically connected _ if and only if _ there is a homotopy between them .",
    "this implies that two insulators in different topological phases can not be adiabatically connected without a topological phase transition ( closing of the energy gap ) . while , therefore , the situation is clear for translation invariant , infinitely extended systems , the challenging task remains of establishing the bulk - boundary correspondence , which states that the boundary of a topological insulator is gapless .",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence has been addressed primarily in the stable regime  @xcite , but numerical results indicate that it also holds in the non - stable regime  @xcite .",
    "however , spatial symmetries ( symmetries that do not commute with translations ) may violate it in either regime ( see  @xcite , section iv  b  4 ) .",
    "based on the refined definition of equivalence , we propose to define strong topological insulators as the non - trivial classes in the subset @xmath37_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}\\subset[t^d , y]_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2},\\label{inclusion1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while weak topological insulators are defined as the complement .",
    "we will refer to this new definition as definition  ( ii ) . in appendix b",
    ", we prove that the above inclusion is indeed well - defined . using similar arguments ,",
    "we show that there is also an inclusion @xmath38_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}\\subset[s^{d_x}\\times t^{d_k},y]_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2},\\label{inclusion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a useful technical result for determining topological phases in the presence of ( single ) defects with codimension @xmath12 , which is used ( without proof for the non - stable regime ) in  @xcite .",
    "the result   and the corresponding definition ( ii ) is to be contrasted with the usual definition ( i ) ( see  @xcite ) in the stable regime . in terms of homotopy theory ,",
    "the latter is based on the decomposition of @xmath32_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}$ ] into a product containing @xmath39 factors of each set @xmath40^*_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}$ ] with @xmath41 : @xmath42_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}\\simeq\\prod_{l=0}^d\\big([s^l , c_s]^*_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}\\big)^{d \\choose l},\\label{decomposition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43^*_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}$ ] denotes the set of homotopy classes of maps @xmath44 mapping a base point @xmath45 in the fixed point set @xmath46 to a base point @xmath47 with all homotopies respecting this property .",
    "this formula holds for all symmetry classes @xmath16 with a slight modification for classes a , ai and aii , where we replace @xmath14 by its connected components @xmath48 containing the base point ( i.e. we fix a number of occupied bands ) and omit the factor with @xmath49 on the right hand side . the decomposition above can be obtained via @xmath3-theory  @xcite , but we give an independent homotopy theoretic proof in appendix a.    as an example , consider three - dimensional insulators in class aii  @xcite . in that case , @xmath50_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}\\simeq{\\mathbb{z}}_2\\times({\\mathbb{z}}_2\\times{\\mathbb{z}}_2\\times{\\mathbb{z}}_2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath51^*_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}=[s^2,c_2]^*_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}={\\mathbb{z}}_2 $ ] and @xmath52^*_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}=0 $ ] ( we use `` 0 '' here to denote the set with only one element ) . the ( original ) definition ( i ) of a strong topological insulator  @xcite is the subset of @xmath32_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}$ ] which is non - trivial in the factor @xmath27^*_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}$ ] . in the example , this would give a set of _ eight _ strong topological insulators , whereas our definition ( ii ) only gives _ one _ strong topological insulator .",
    "in the language of  @xcite , there is a strong invariant @xmath53 and three weak invariants @xmath54 , @xmath55 , all taking values @xmath8 or @xmath56 so that every phase is described by the tuple @xmath57 .",
    "a strong insulator in  @xcite is any element of the form @xmath58 , giving 8 possibilities , while with our definition only the element @xmath59 is strong . in both definitions ,",
    "_ weak _ topological insulators are the complementary set respectively .",
    "an example which shows that the factorization in   may not hold in the non - stable regime is given by the hopf insulator  @xcite .",
    "this is a three - dimensional insulator with one occupied and one empty band in class a. the topological phases of this model have been computed in  @xcite : @xmath60=\\{(&n_0;n_1,n_2,n_3)\\mid n_1,n_2,n_3\\in{\\mathbb{z}};\\\\ & n_0\\in{\\mathbb{z}}\\text { for } n_1=n_2=n_3=0\\text { and}\\\\ & n_0\\in{\\mathbb{z}}_{2\\cdot\\gcd(n_1,n_2,n_3)}\\text { otherwise}\\}\\label{hopf } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this example demonstrates that the invariants may not be independent of each other as in the stable regime . only for @xmath61",
    "do we find @xmath62\\subset[t^3,\\text{gr}_1(\\mathbb{c}^2)]$ ] and definition ( ii ) only considers the non - trivial elements in this subset to be strong topological insulators .",
    "another example of a strong invariant `` breaking down '' when lower dimensional invariants become non - trivial will be presented in the next section .",
    "crucially , this example will demonstrate that strong topological insulators according to definition ( i ) may be realized by stacking lower - dimensional systems .",
    "hence , only definition ( ii ) has the property that all strong topological insulators in @xmath0 dimensions are `` truly @xmath0-dimensional '' ( we use this phrase synonymously for the property of not being realizable by stacking lower - dimensional systems ) .",
    "before we introduce the example that motivates the use of definition ( ii ) over ( i ) , we introduce a formalism to deal with the possibility of stacking insulators into higher dimensions .",
    "let the translation - invariant hamiltonian @xmath63 of an @xmath17-band model act on the hilbert space of a @xmath0-dimensional lattice .",
    "in a basis @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 to ensure hermiticity .    in the following , we will fix the given basis and work only with the matrix @xmath69 . after a fourier transform ,",
    "the bloch hamiltonian is given by @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "we now view @xmath72 as being embedded into some bigger lattice @xmath73 with @xmath74 . in , a canonical embedding is given by letting @xmath75 and setting @xmath76 whenever @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "physically , this means no hopping into the new @xmath79 directions or , equivalently , stacking of the @xmath0-dimensional system into these directions .    to generalize the stacking direction ,",
    "we introduce an invertible , integer @xmath80-by-@xmath80 matrix @xmath81 and define the stacked hamiltonian to be given by the replacement @xmath82 , corresponding to changing the hopping from the @xmath83-direction to the @xmath84-direction .    defining the projection @xmath85 by @xmath86 ,",
    "the bloch hamiltonian of the stacked system can be expressed by the lower - dimensional bloch hamiltonian : @xmath87 the change in @xmath88-dependence descends to the level of ground state maps .",
    "therefore , given a ground state @xmath89 , stacking it in @xmath80 dimensions according to the matrix @xmath90 yields a map @xmath91      we are now in a position to analyse another example which will illustrate three points :    * in general , only non - trivial elements in @xmath92_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}\\subset[t^d , y]_{{\\mathbb{z}}_2}$ ] can not be realized by stacking lower - dimensional systems * strong invariants can `` break down '' in the non - stable regime * base points make a difference in the non - stable regime    the model we consider is a two - dimensional system with three bands , one of which is occupied .",
    "we assume that the combination @xmath93 of time - reversal @xmath94 ( with @xmath95 ) and inversion @xmath96 ( with @xmath97 ) is a symmetry , but individually , both @xmath98 and @xmath99 symmetries are broken .",
    "since this symmetry fixes all momenta , the image of any ground state map lies within the fixed point set @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , we can consider non - equivariant ground state maps @xmath101 which have been studied in the context of nematics in  @xcite , where the torus plays the role of a measuring surface around closed defect lines .",

    "hence , after identification to obtain the unbased classes ( see appendix b ) , @xmath110 changes to @xmath111 ( skyrmions of charge @xmath106 are homotopic to ones with charge @xmath112 ) .",
    "again , the strong invariants @xmath111 `` break down '' to @xmath24 in the presence of non - trivial lower - dimensional invariants @xmath113 $ ] , which are non - trivial if they involve a @xmath114 rotation of lines along the loop , a configuration known as a moebius strip ( see fig .  [ 01 ] for an example which is canonically embedded into two dimensions ) .    in this model , _ all _ classes except those of the form @xmath115 with @xmath116 , which correspond to non - trivial elements in @xmath107\\subset[t^2,\\text{gr}_1(\\mathbb{r}^3)]$ ] , have representatives that are stacked versions of one - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "this gives a total of _ seven _ stackable classes ( four with @xmath117 and three with @xmath118 ) .",
    "this is remarkable , since naively , the @xmath24 classification in one dimension would suggest only _ four _ classes ( @xmath24 in both linearly independent directions and @xmath117 ) . hence , in general , only definition ( ii ) can guarantee that no stackable strong topological insulators can occur .",
    "notice that the full restriction of strong topological insulators to @xmath107\\subset[t^2,\\text{gr}_1(\\mathbb{r}^3)]$ ] is necessary in order to avoid strong topological insulators that may be stacked , excluding the possibility of a compromise between definitions ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "+   +    fig .",
    "[ skyrmions ] illustrates some representatives .",
    "while a single skyrmion representing @xmath119 can not be realized by stacking , having a skyrmion combined with non - trivial projections allows for this possibility .",
    "the following is an example of a weak topological insulator ( acording to both definitions ) in the stable regime , which can not be realized through stacking : in two dimensions , consider a @xmath120-band model with @xmath20 occupied and @xmath20 empty bands in class aiii .",
    "let there be a @xmath121-symmetry , for example conservation of the spin @xmath122-component , which commutes with the chiral operator ( which in turn anti - commutes with the hamiltonian ) .",
    "then the ground state is a map @xmath123 and the topological phases ( homotopy classes ) are given by @xmath124 & = [ t^2,u_n]\\times[t^2,u_n]\\nonumber\\\\ & = ( { \\mathbb{z}}\\times{\\mathbb{z}})\\times({\\mathbb{z}}\\times{\\mathbb{z}})\\label{4invariants}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath125=0 $ ] ( only weak topological insulators here , according to either definition ) and @xmath19 is connected , the factors @xmath110 originate from @xmath126={\\mathbb{z}}$ ] .",

    "the mathematical reason is the fact that @xmath138 is not generated by a single element .",
    "the physical reason is that the non - trivial winding for spin up happens along a linearly independent direction from that of the non - trivial winding for spin down and therefore there is no corresponding one - dimensional system .",
    "we have proposed to use the natural concept of homotopy theory to extend the results from @xmath3-theory ( and the intermediate step of considering isomorphism classes of vector bundles ) to the non - stable regime , which includes _ all _ insulators independent of the number of occupied / empty bands .",
    "we showed that the definition of strong topological insulators has to be more restrictive in general in order to avoid the possibility of realising them by stacking lower - dimensional systems .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated that there are topological insulators in @xmath0 dimensions that are `` truly @xmath0-dimensional '' despite being weak ( independently of how the latter is defined ) , meaning they can not be realized by stacking lower - dimensional systems .    along the way ,",
    "we derived some useful technical results : we showed how the factorization of topological invariants in the stable regime can be understood from the perspective of homotopy theory and proved that in general ( in the stable and non - stable regime ) , it is legitimate to replace a domain consisting of products of spheres by a single sphere of the same total dimension , even in the presence of @xmath24-equivariance .",
