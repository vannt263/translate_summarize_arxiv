    "<S> the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo method is applied to compute the spin susceptibility and the compressibility of neutron matter at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> results are given for realistic interactions which include both a two  body potential of the argonne type and the urbana ix three  body potential . </S>",
    "<S> simulations have been carried out for about 60 neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> we find an overall reduction of the spin susceptibilty by about a factor of 3 with respect to the pauli susceptibility for a wide range of densities . </S>",
    "<S> results for the compressibility of neutron matter are also presented and compared with other available estimates obtained for semirealistic nucleon  nucleon interactions and with more traditional many  </S>",
    "<S> body techniques , like brueckner s or correlated basis function theories .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that the strong correlations induced by realistic nucleon  nucleon interactions reduce , by up to about a factor of 3 , the spin susceptibility , @xmath0 , of degenerate neutron matter . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction may have important implications for problems of astrophysical interest , like for instance , neutrino scattering rates in dense matter and , more generally , the study of supernovae and proto  neutron stars@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> starting from the pioneering work by sawyer@xcite , several calculations of the neutrino mean free path in uniform nuclear matter have been performed@xcite which show that the effects due to strong interactions are relevant , particularly in the spin - density channel which couples with the axial vector current . a sizable reduction of @xmath0 , or , equivalently , a large value of the @xmath1 landau parameter leads to an appreciable suppression of the gamow  teller transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino momenta and the momentum transfers in many applications are small compared with the neutron fermi momentum , and both energy transfers and the temperature are small compared with the neutron fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the landau parameters of neutron matter at zero temperature are the main quantities to compute in order to evaluate the mean free path of a neutrino in dense matter .    in this respect , _ ab initio _ calculations of the landau parameters or related quantities , such as the compressibility @xmath2 , the effective mass @xmath3 or the spin susceptibility @xmath0 , for degenerate neutron matter are extremely important . </S>",
    "<S> such calculations can now be performed because of recent advances in many  </S>",
    "<S> body methods , particularly those based on quantum simulations , and because of the much improved knowledge of the nucleon  nucleon interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> previous evaluations of the landau parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) for neutron matter were based either on skyrme  type potential models@xcite or on microscopic calculations performed with semirealistic bare interactions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative behaviour of the compressibility ratio is @xmath7 where @xmath8 the compressibility of the non interacting fermi gas , is similar in most of the various calculations . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the spin susceptibility ratio , which is approximately related to @xmath1 by @xmath9 may differ up to a factor of 3 at equilibrium density of nuclear matter @xmath10 , and even more at higher densities .    </S>",
    "<S> the skyrme models generally predict much smaller values of @xmath1 with respect to microscopic calculations , and become unstable to spin oscillations , driving toward ferromagnetic ground states@xcite , since @xmath11 becomes negative for densities in the range @xmath12 . at small momentum transfer , </S>",
    "<S> n  n correlations enhance the spin  </S>",
    "<S> response approximately by a factor @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , skyrme models predict neutrino mean free paths smaller than microscopic models .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the existing microscopic calculations have been performed with old semirealistic interactions , like the reid or the bethe  johnston potentials , and no three  body force . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the many  body methods used until now may be questionable for the convergence of the underlying perturbation theory as well as for the treatment of spin  dependent correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> we report the results of quantum simulations of neutron matter for the old reid@xmath14 potential @xcite and modern realistic interactions , based upon the argonne @xmath15 two  body potential plus the urbana three  body potential , uix , @xcite , denoted hereafter as au18 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that such interactions provide a realistic description of light nuclei and nuclear matter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum simulations have been carried out by using a new diffusion monte carlo method , the so called afdmc method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it introduces auxiliary field variables in the simulation , which makes it the only existing quantum monte carlo method that can handle spin  </S>",
    "<S> dependent nuclear hamiltonians and a relatively large number of nucleons . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the scalar parts of the hamiltonian are propagated as in standard diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> auxiliary fields are introduced to replace the spin  isospin dependent interactions between pairs of particles with interactions between particles and auxiliary fields . </S>",
    "<S> integrating over the auxiliary fields reproduces the original spin  isospin dependent interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the method consists of a monte carlo sampling of the auxiliary fields and then propagating the spin  </S>",
    "<S> isospin variables at the sampled values of the auxiliary fields . </S>",
    "<S> this propagation results in a rotation of each particle s spin  </S>",
    "<S> isospin spinor .    </S>",
    "<S> the guiding function , @xmath16 , in our afdmc calculation is a simple trial function given by a slater determinant of one  body space  </S>",
    "<S> spin orbitals multiplied by a central jastrow correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the orbitals are plane waves that fit in the box times two component spinors , corresponding to neutron  up and neutron  down states . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap of a walker with this wave function is the determinant of the space  </S>",
    "<S> spin orbitals , evaluated at the walker position and spinor for each particle , and multiplied by the scalar jastrow product . </S>",
    "<S> such an overlap is complex , so the usual fermion sign problem becomes a phase problem . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the path of the walkers to a region where the real part of the overlap with our trial function is positive . for spin  </S>",
    "<S> independent potentials this reduces to the fixed  node approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> this method has already been applied to unpolarized neutron matter and neutron drops ( @xmath17 ) with fairly realistic interactions that include tensor , spin  orbit and three  body terms . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron matter calculations have been done with up to 66 neutrons in a periodic box with a low variance ( @xmath18 mev per nucleon ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation scales in particle number roughly like fermion monte carlo with central forces @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we compute the spin susceptibility by applying a magnetic field to the system . ignoring any orbital effects , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the susceptibility is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number density and @xmath24 is the ground energy in field @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us use the pauli expansion of the energy per particle as a function of the spin polarization @xmath26    @xmath27    where the derivatives are with respect to the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> minimizing @xmath28 with respect to @xmath29 one gets the following result for the spin susceptibility    @xmath30    for a noninteracting fermi gas the spin susceptibility is @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> afdmc allows us to get the energy eigenvalue , @xmath32 , for the interacting system in a field @xmath25 for a state of a given spin asymmetry @xmath33 .    assuming that the energy and polarization are known in terms of @xmath34 , @xmath35 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ suspauli ] ) can be obtained as a straightforward application of the chain rule    @xmath36^{-2 } \\left \\ { \\frac{\\partial^2 e_0}{\\partial j_z^2 } - \\frac{\\partial e_0}{\\partial j_z } \\left [ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial j_z } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial j_z^2 } \\right \\ } \\ .\\ ] ]    since we are calculating the lowest energy state , the derivative of the energy with respect to @xmath34 vanishes . </S>",

    "<S> for such systems the energy is not a quadratic function of the external field @xmath25 . in figure [ f1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath32 , as a function of @xmath25 , for four different systems with a finite number @xmath37 of noninteracting neutrons in a periodic box at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the cases , for which we have done simulations , are shown in the figure , namely @xmath39=@xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the various @xmath44 are linear in @xmath25 and each of them is tangent to the pauli parabola ( which refers to infinite fermi gas case ) at some value @xmath45 of the field @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare in the figure the pauli parabola with the exact result for the fermi gas at that density . </S>",
    "<S> they are very close up to @xmath46 mev . </S>",
    "<S> using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ esecond ] ) , one gets @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    in the interacting case , the derivatives in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ esecond ] ) can be easily estimated by computing @xmath32 with afdmc , and using the following equations    @xmath50    whose validity relies on the following reasonable assumptions : ( i ) for @xmath51 , @xmath32 is quadratic in @xmath34 ; ( ii ) for a fixed @xmath34 , @xmath32 is linear in @xmath25 ; ( iii ) the polarization is linear in @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> these assumptions become exact in the limit of an infinite system with @xmath34 and @xmath25 small .    </S>",
    "<S> the non  interacting case indicates the use of @xmath52 and the value for @xmath45 at which @xmath53 is tangent to the pauli parabola ( for the density @xmath54 of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] , @xmath55 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of our calculations have been carried out with @xmath52 . at @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> we have verified the linearity of @xmath53 on @xmath25 beyond @xmath57mev finding that the result for @xmath58 is largely independent on the value of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also verified the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath59 , performing simulations with @xmath60 and found that it is very weak .    </S>",
    "<S> a time step @xmath61 was sufficient in most of the quantum simulations to obtain agreement between the mixed and the growth energies @xcite within the statistical accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> we have made simulations with the reid @xmath14 interaction ( reid6 ) , the same used in the correlated basis function calculation of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our result for @xmath58 , at @xmath62 , is about @xmath63 smaller , which indicates that the cbf perturbative calculations of ref.@xcite , based on jastrow  correlated basis functions , either have not reached a satisfactory convergence for the landau parameter @xmath1 or eq ( [ susc_ratio ] ) may not be sufficiently adequate for the reid6 interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered realistic interactions , characterized by the so called @xmath64 or @xmath65 two  body potentials plus uix three  body potential , and hereafter denoted as au6 and au8 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath65 is a two  body potential of the argonne type which includes the four central spin  isospin components , plus the four tensor and spin  orbit ones . </S>",
    "<S> it fits the nucleon  </S>",
    "<S> nucleon experimental data and embodies the main features of the argonne @xmath15@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath64 potential is the @xmath65 with its spin  orbit components removed .    </S>",
    "<S> our results for @xmath58 , obtained with the reid6 , au6 and au8 interactions are given in table [ t1 ] and compared with previous microscopic calcuations of the same quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the brueckner theory calculations of ref.@xcite are performed with the full reid potential , and , therefore are not directly comparable with our reid6 calculations . </S>",

    "<S> orbit component of the two  body potential . </S>",
    "<S> our results for au6 and au8 coincide within the statistical error . to address the problem of the influence of the three - body force on the results </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the spin susceptibility at @xmath54 using the argonne @xmath64 potential and no three body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that while the energy is reduced by roughly 25 mev per particle , the spin susceptibility ratio is practically unchanged ( 0.31(1 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the compressibility @xmath2 , given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a polynomial fit to the afdmc energies @xmath68 . for a fermi gas </S>",
    "<S> the compressibility is @xmath69 . </S>",

    "<S> for the sake of completeness we show in fig . </S>",
