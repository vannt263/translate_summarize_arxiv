    "the study of periodic surfaces has recently encountered new developments in homogeneous @xmath0-spaces . in @xmath1 ,",

    "other examples are involved in important results such as the resolution of alexandrov problem in a quotient space of @xmath1 by menezes  @xcite or the fact the calabi - yau conjectures do not hold for embedded minimal surface in @xmath1 by rodrguez and tinaglia  @xcite . in heisenberg space ,",
    "new examples are mostly of scherk type like the jenkins - serrin theorem for compact domains obtained by pinheiro  @xcite .    the present paper deals with the construction of another kind of scherk type surfaces , called _ most symmetric saddle towers _ , in heisenberg space .",
    "a saddle tower is a minimal surface that can be thought of as the desingularization of @xmath3 vertical planes , @xmath4 , intersecting along a vertical geodesic ; in particular it is a complete embedded minimal surface with @xmath5 planar ends .",
    "historically , they were first found by scherk  @xcite for @xmath6 in euclidean space @xmath7   a saddle tower with @xmath6 is usually called a _ singly periodic scherk surface _   and ( more than ) a century and half later karcher  @xcite generalized the construction to any @xmath4 .",
    "another couple of decades later , morabito and rodrguez  @xcite and pyo  @xcite constructed saddle towers in @xmath1 .",
    "recently , menezes  @xcite constructed the singly ( and doubly ) periodic scherk surfaces in semi - direct product spaces , including heisenberg space .",
    "we use a classical method to construct saddle towers in heisenberg space ( see section  [ sec : saddle ] ) .",
    "we first construct a sequence of embedded minimal disks   by solving plateau problems on suitable jordan curves   such that it converges to an embedded minimal surface bordered by horizontal geodesic arcs , which we call the _",
    "fundamental piece_. reflecting the fundamental piece along the geodesics in its boundary , we get the desired saddle tower :    thm : saddle for any @xmath4 and @xmath8 , there exists a properly embedded singly periodic minimal surface of genus zero with @xmath5 planar ends distributed at constant angle @xmath9 .",
    "we call it a _ most symmetric saddle tower_.    since the saddle tower is composed of reflections of the fundamental piece , its ends must be equiangularly distributed to ensure the embeddedness of the surface .",
    "note that morabito and rodrguez  @xcite constructed non equiangular saddle towers with a conjugate plateau technique , which does not apply in heisenberg space .",
    "the key step is to prove the convergence of the sequence of minimal disks , which is done by using a suitable barrier .",
    "we construct that barrier in section  [ sec : barrier ] by deforming a minimal plane so that we control the asymptotic behavior of the deformed minimal surfaces .",
    "the deformation technique is based on the existence of an elliptic operator , called the _ compactified mean curvature operator _ , containing information on both the asymptotic behavior and the mean curvature .",
    "this technique has already been used by the author and hauswirth  @xcite for surfaces in @xmath1 of constant mean curvature @xmath2 .",
    "it is an immediate consequence of weierstrass representation that the construction of such surfaces is not possible in euclidean space since   under reasonable asumptions on the total curvature   minimal ends are asymptotically rotational .",
    "the present barrier construction highlights another difference with euclidean case :    thm : disjgraphs in heisenberg space , the number of disjoint domains supporting minimal vertical graphs is unbounded .",
