    "linear mode analyses provide a useful tool in gaining important insight into the relevant physical processes determining the stability of magnetized accretion flows . studies of local linear modes of accretion disks threaded by weak magnetic fields have pointed out important clues on viable mechanisms for angular momentum transport and the subsequent accretion of matter onto the central objects @xcite .",
    "they have also provided simplified physical models and analogies over which more complex physics can , in principle , be added @xcite .",
    "these treatments were carried out in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) limit ( but see quataert , dorland & hammett 2002 who studied the kinetic limit ) and invoked a number of approximations appropriate to the study of the evolution of short - wavelength perturbations , when weak fields are considered . in this context ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath0 , is inferred by comparing the thermal pressure , @xmath1 , to the magnetic pressure and is characterized by a plasma parameter , @xmath2 .",
    "it is not hard to find situations of astrophysical interest , however , in which the condition of weak magnetic fields is not satisfied .",
    "a common example of such a situation is the innermost region of an accretion disk around a magnetic neutron star .",
    "it is widely accepted that x - ray pulsars are powered by accretion of matter onto the polar caps of magnetic neutron stars . for this to occur , matter in the nearly keplerian accretion disk",
    "has to be funneled along the field lines .",
    "this suggests that , at some radius , centrifugal forces and thermal pressure have to be overcome by magnetic stresses , leading naturally to regions where @xmath3 .    in the context of accretion disks ,",
    "the presence of superthermal fields in rarefied coronae also seems hard to avoid , if coronal heating is a direct consequence of the internal dynamics of the disk itself rather than being produced by external irradiation from the central object .",
    "three - dimensional mhd simulations by @xcite showed that magnetic turbulence can effectively couple with buoyancy to transport the magnetic energy produced by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in weakly magnetized disks to create a strongly magnetized corona within a few scale heights from the disk plane . on long time scales ,",
    "the average vertical disk structure consists of a weakly magnetized ( @xmath4 ) turbulent core below two scale heights and a strongly magnetized ( @xmath5 ) non - turbulent corona above it .",
    "the late stages of evolution in these models show that the disks themselves become magnetically dominated .",
    "@xcite also found that the average plasma @xmath6 in disk coronae is @xmath7 and the volume filling factor for regions with @xmath8 is up to @xmath9 . even in the absence of an initial toroidal component",
    ", simulations carried out by @xcite showed that low-@xmath6 regions develop near the equator of the disk because of a strong toroidal component of the magnetic field generated by shear . on more theoretical grounds , strong toroidal magnetic fields produced by strong shear in the boundary layer region",
    "have been suggested as responsible for the observed bipolar outflows in young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite found self - consistent solutions for thin magnetically - supported accretion disks and pointed out the necessity of assessing the stability properties of such configurations .",
    "another case in which magnetic fields seem to play an important dynamical role in rotating fluid configurations is that of magnetically supported molecular clouds",
    ". observations of both large zeeman line - splitting and of broad molecular lines support the presence of superthermal fields ( see myers & goodman 1988 for further references and bourke & goodman 2003 for a review on the current understanding on the role of magnetic fields in molecular clouds ) .",
    "values of the plasma @xmath6 of the order of @xmath10 have also been used in numerical studies of the structural properties of giant molecular clouds @xcite .    as a last example of astrophysical interest",
    ", we mention magnetocentrifugally driven winds , such as those observed in protostars .",
    "these outflows seem to play an important role in the evolution of young stellar objects and in the dynamics of the parent clouds by providing a source of turbulent energy .",
    "magnetocentrifugal jets typically involve internal alfvn speeds comparable to the flow speeds .",
    "these structures are supported mainly by magnetic pressure due to strong toroidal fields",
    ". the ratio of magnetic pressure in the jet to the gas pressure of the ambient medium can be of the order of @xmath11 ( for an extensive study of mhd driven instabilities in these systems see kim & ostriker 2000 and  [ subsec : comparison to previous analytical studies ] ) .    in this paper , we investigate the local linear stability of differentially rotating flows without imposing any _ a priori _ restrictions on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "we do , however , restrict our attention to rotationally supported flows ( we loosely use this term to refer to flows with internal alfvn speeds smaller than the rotational speed ) .",
    "our intent is to demonstrate that the effects of the finite curvature of the toroidal field lines on the stability of small - wavelength vertical perturbations ( i.e. , on the most unstable modes present in the weak - field mri ) can not be neglected when superthermal toroidal fields are present .",
    "in order to achieve this task , we relax the boussinesq approximation ( see also papaloizou & szuszkiewicz 1992 and blaes & balbus 1994 ) , which is valid only when the toroidal component of the field is subthermal @xcite .",
    "we thus consider the mhd fluid to be fully compressible .",
    "moreover , even though we perform a local analysis , we do consider curvature terms when evaluating magnetic forces , for they become important in the strong - field regime ( see also knobloch 1992 and kim & ostriker 2000 ) .    in most early studies addressing the mri",
    ", it was found that the only role played by a toroidal component in the magnetic field is to quench the growth rates of the modes that are already unstable when only weak vertical fields are considered ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; blaes & balbus 1994 ; see quataert , dorland , & hammett 2002 for the kinetic limit ; see also kim & ostriker 2000 for the cold mhd limit ) .",
    "here , we show that , when strong fields are considered and the approximations usually invoked in the study of the weak - field mri are relaxed , the presence of a toroidal component of the magnetic field plays a crucial role not only in the growth rates of the unstable modes but also in determining which modes are subject to instabilities .",
    "as expected , the presence of a toroidal component breaks the symmetry of the problem , also giving rise to traveling modes .",
    "moreover , for a broad range of magnetic field strengths , we find that two different instabilities are present .",
    "they both appear as the result of coupling between the modes that become the alfvn and the slow mode in the limit of no rotation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : mhd equations and dispersion relation ] , we describe the physical setup to be studied , present the dispersion relation to be solved , and discuss the importance of curvature terms in the limit of superthermal fields . in  [ sec : numerical solutions ] , we solve numerically the dispersion relation in some interesting regimes . in  [ sec : onset of instabilities ] , we study the onset of instabilities as a function of magnetic field strengths and present some useful approximate criteria that enable us to study analytically some aspects of the full problem . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare our results to previous investigations and discuss some of the implications of this study . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : summary and conclusions ] , we present a brief summary and our conclusions .",
    "we start with the set of equations that govern the behavior of a polytropic fluid in the mhd approximation , @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 in these equations , @xmath16 is the mass density , @xmath17 the velocity , @xmath1 the gas pressure , and @xmath18 the polytropic index ; @xmath19 is the magnetic field and @xmath20 the gravitational potential . for convenience",
    "we adopt a cylindrical set of coordinates @xmath21 with origin in the central object ( i.e. , the neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "we assume a steady axisymmetric background flow characterized by a velocity field of the form @xmath22 and threaded by a background magnetic field . for consistency ,",
    "our analysis is restricted to background fields of the form @xmath23 since the effect of including a radial component in the field is to generate a linear growth in time of the toroidal component @xcite . under these circumstances ,",
    "all the background quantities depend on the radial and vertical coordinates only . in the present treatment",
    ", we neglect the self gravity of the fluid .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that magnetically dominated accretion disks have lower surface and volume densities for a fixed accretion rate .",
    "this suggests that these systems are lighter than standard disks and thus are not subject to self - gravity instabilities .      in order to perform the local linear mode analysis , we perturb the set of equations ( [ eq : continuity])-([eq : energy ] ) by substituting every physical variable @xmath24 by @xmath25 and retain only linear orders in @xmath26 . in the following , we focus our analysis on the study of axisymmetric perturbations in an axisymmetric background .",
    "we first consider , in some detail , the radial component of the momentum equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) , which becomes @xmath27 -{\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r } } \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\rho } \\left ( b_\\phi   { \\frac{\\partial b_\\phi}{\\partial r } } + b_z   { \\frac{\\partial b_z}{\\partial r } } \\right ) \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho } - \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\rho } \\left [ b_z { \\frac{\\partial \\delta b_r}{\\partial z } }    - 2 \\frac{b_\\phi}{r } \\delta b_\\phi \\right ] - \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\rho }   \\frac{b_\\phi^2}{r } \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho } = 0 ~.\\ ] ] the coefficients in this linear equation for the perturbed variables depend in general on @xmath28 and @xmath29 , [ e.g. , the angular velocity @xmath30 is in general @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , at this point , the decomposition of perturbed quantities in fourier modes  e.g. , symbolically @xmath32  would not result in any particular simplification of the problem .",
    "this can be seen by taking the fourier transform of equation ( [ eq : euler_r_linear_step1 ] ) which results in a sum of convolutions of the fourier transforms of background and perturbed quantities .",
    "further progress can be made if we restrict the wavelengths of the perturbations for which our stability analysis is valid . to this end",
    ", we choose a fiducial point , @xmath33 , around which we perform the local stability analysis .",

    ". equation ( [ eq : euler_r_linear_step2 ] ) is a linear partial - differential equation in the local variables for the perturbed quantities but with constant coefficients .",
    "this is a good approximation as long as the departures @xmath44 are small compared to the length scales over which there are significant variations in the background quantities , i.e , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the characteristic length scales in the radial and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "it is only now that it is useful to expand the perturbed quantities in equation ( [ eq : euler_r_linear_step2 ] ) in fourier modes .",

    "the validity of the analysis is now restricted to modes with wavenumbers satisfying @xmath55 and @xmath56 . without loss of generality , we assume that the fiducial point is inside the disk so we can write the local conditions on the wavenumbers as @xmath57 and @xmath58 . moreover , for fiducial points such that @xmath59 the latter condition also implies @xmath60 .    at this point",

    "the local conditions over the wavenumbers now read @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    the factors @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , are just convenient dummy variables that we introduce in order to help us keep track of the terms that account for the finite curvature of the background and are usually neglected in local studies of the weak - field mri .",
    "their numerical values are to be regarded as unity , unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath84 and @xmath85 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) and the term proportional to @xmath86 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_phi_grads ] ) are due to the effects of magnetic tension and they appear naturally when a cylindrical coordinate system is adopted .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath87 in equations ( [ eq : pert_cont_grads ] ) and ( [ eq : pert_induc_z_grads ] ) are related to flux conservation in cylindrical coordinates . although the three terms labeled by @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 share the same physical origin ( i.e. , magnetic tension introduced by the curvature of toroidal field lines ) , it is useful to be able to distinguish among them because the one labeled with @xmath85 vanishes in the limit of an incompressible flow .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq : pert_induc_r_grads ] ) and ( [ eq : pert_induc_z_grads ] ) ensure a divergence - free perturbed magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath88 , only when the finite curvature of the background is accounted for ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) .",
    "up to this point , our intention has been to keep the discussion as general as possible in order to clearly state all the assumptions that we have made to obtain the set of equations for the perturbations to perform a local linear mode analysis . for the sake of simplicity , and to avoid the parametric study from being too extensive , we further invoke the following assumptions .",
    "we choose the fiducial point @xmath35 to lie in the disk mid - plane and assume that , locally , the vertical gradients in all background quantities are negligible and set them to zero .",
    "this will be a good approximation as long as we consider equilibrium configurations such that @xmath90 note that the solenoidal character of the magnetic field ensures that , for @xmath91 , the condition @xmath92 holds for arbitrary @xmath29 .    in general , the forces induced by the curvature terms ( e.g. , the one proportional to @xmath85 in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ] ) and those induced by background ( logarithmic ) gradients in the radial direction , ( e.g. , the term proportional to @xmath93 in the same equation ) will not cancel each other . as a single exception , for the case in which @xmath94 ,",
    "the most important effects due to the finite curvature of toroidal field lines are canceled out by the gradients in the toroidal field .",
    "this particular case , however , might not be completely relevant to realistic rotating flows since , in order to ensure force balance when the thermal pressure can be neglected against magnetic stresses , the magnetic field strength must decline more slowly than @xmath95 ( see , e.g. , kim & ostriker 2000 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we further focus our attention on the study of differentially rotating , axisymmetric mhd flows with locally negligible radial gradients in the background density and magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath96 in the rest of the paper , we consider that the only background flow variable with a non - negligible local radial gradient is the angular velocity @xmath97 and set all other radial gradients to zero .",
    "note that this assumption is widely invoked in many investigations of the weak - field mri ( e.g. , blaes & balbus 1994 ; balbus & hawley 1998 ; blaes & socrates 2001 ; quataert , dorland , & hammett 2002 ; balbus 2003 ) .",
    "the assumption that the only background variable with a non - negligible radial gradient is the angular velocity is also generally a part of the initial set of conditions used in many numerical analyses of the mri in the shearing box approximation ( e.g. , hawley , gammie , & balbus 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; miller & stone 2000 ) .    in spite of being linear in the perturbed quantities ,",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath82 have been neglected in previous local studies of the mri under the assumption that @xmath80 and @xmath98 ( but see also knobloch 1992 and kim & ostriker 2000 ) .",
    "although comparing an imaginary term against a real one in a stability analysis might seem particularly risky , this might not be a bad argument in order to neglect the terms proportional to @xmath84 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) or @xmath87 in equations ( [ eq : pert_cont_grads ] ) and ( [ eq : pert_induc_z_grads ] ) against @xmath99 ( but see the discussion in appendix a ) .",
    "the same could be said about the terms proportional to @xmath85 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) or @xmath86 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_phi_grads ] ) in the limit of a very weak toroidal component in the magnetic field , given that both of them are proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "it is not evident , however , that we can neglect the terms proportional to either @xmath85 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) or @xmath86 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_phi_grads ] ) if we are to explore the regime of strong toroidal fields .",
    "there are two different reasons for this . in order to neglect the term",
    "proportional to @xmath85 against the one proportional to @xmath101 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) we should be able to ensure that the condition @xmath102 is always satisfied , since both terms are proportional to @xmath103 . in this particular case , neglecting the forces induced by the bending of toroidal field lines becomes a progressively worse approximation the colder the disk is and is not well justified in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "the case presented in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_phi_grads ] ) is even harder to justify a priori since now we would need to guarantee that the condition @xmath105 is always satisfied .",
    "however , this ratio is not only proportional to @xmath106 , which might not be negligible in many astrophysical contexts but , through the ratio @xmath107 , is also a function of @xmath101 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 ; the magnitude of this term is therefore unknown until we solve the problem fully .",
    "a similar situation to this one is encountered if we aim to compare the term @xmath110 with the term proportional to @xmath111 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) ( see  [ subsec : importance ] for further discussion ) .    for the sake of consistency and in order not to impose a constraint on the magnitude of the toroidal alfvn speed with respect to the sound speed we keep all the terms proportional to the parameters @xmath82 .",
    "we will later show that the term proportional to @xmath84 is negligible when superthermal toroidal fields are considered .",
    "we will also discuss under which conditions the terms proportional to @xmath87 can be neglected and why the terms proportional to @xmath85 and @xmath86 are particularly important .      in order to seek for non - trivial solutions of the homogeneous system of linear equations ( [ eq : pert_cont_grads])-([eq : pert_induc_z_grads ] ) we set its determinant to zero .",

    "although the original linear system ( [ eq : pert_cont_grads])-([eq : pert_induc_z_grads ] ) related seven variables ( recall that we had eliminated @xmath113 in terms of @xmath103 using eq .  [ [ eq : energy ] ] which is time - independent ) , the characteristic polynomial is only of @xmath114 degree .",
    "this is easily understood by noting that equations ( [ eq : pert_induc_r_grads ] ) and ( [ eq : pert_induc_z_grads ] ) can be combined into one single equation expressing the solenoidal character of the perturbations in the magnetic field , @xmath115 .",
    "this implies a relationship between @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( or equivalently between @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) that must be satisfied at all times and is , therefore , independent of @xmath120 .",
    "the fact that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) is of @xmath121 and not of @xmath122 degree is because we are taking into account the effects of finite compressibility .",
    "this can be seen immediately by taking the limit @xmath123 .",
    "once all the dimensionless variables have been properly defined , it is not evident that the magnetic - tension terms , proportional to @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , will play a negligible role in determining the eigenfrequencies @xmath120 .",
    "this is because the non - vanishing toroidal component of the magnetic field introduces odd powers in the dispersion relation and hence break its even symmetry .",
    "in fact , small modifications in the odd - power coefficients can and do have an important impact on the nature ( real vs. complex ) of the solutions . as we will see in  [ sec : numerical solutions ] and describe in further detail in ",
    "[ sec : onset of instabilities ] , these curvature terms introduce further coupling between the radial and toroidal directions , which in turn result in a strong coupling between the alfvn and the slow mode .    also important is the fact that some of the coefficients in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) are no longer real due to the factors @xmath99 .",
    "the presence of these terms does not allow us to affirm that complex roots will appear in conjugate pairs .",
    "as we discuss in appendix a , the terms proportional to @xmath99 play an important role in determining the stability of modes for which the ratio @xmath124 is non - negligible , even in the local limit , i.e. , when @xmath80 .",
    "of course the smaller the ratio @xmath124 , the smaller the effects of the factors @xmath99 will be .",
    "if we consider the limit @xmath125 in equation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) , the imaginary part of all the coefficients in the dispersion relation will become negligible . in this limiting case , whenever a given complex root is a solution of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] )",
    "so is its complex conjugate , for the dispersion relation has real coefficients ( see appendix a ) .    in the next section",
    ", we will show that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) reduces to the dispersion relations previously derived in many local studies in different regimes .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that this dispersion relation fully considers the effects of compressibility and magnetic tension simultaneously without imposing any restrictions on the field strength or geometry .",
    "this feature is crucial in determining the stability properties of the mhd flow when strong toroidal fields are considered .",
    "there has been some discussion in the past about the importance of the curvature terms for the stability of magnetized keplerian flows @xcite . in studies in which these terms were considered @xcite , compressibility effects were neglected . on the other hand , there have also been treatments in which compressibility was addressed but the curvature terms were neglected @xcite . both types of studies provided arguments for and against the importance of these terms .",

    "each of these were parameterized as @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 , respectively .",
    "most of their analysis dealt with a constant vertical field and they allowed variations of the exponents @xmath301 , with the restriction that they correspond to a physical equilibrium state with a stationary pressure distribution .",
    "although the majority of that paper dealt with global characteristics , they also performed a wkb analysis and concluded that , for @xmath302 and @xmath303 , the growth rate of unstable modes is suppressed on both short and long wavelengths and it approaches zero when @xmath304 . on the other hand",
    ", for @xmath305 and @xmath306 , they found a new instability , with a growth rate that increased with @xmath307 .",
    "they call this the large field instability ( lfi ) and showed that it can be stabilized for sufficiently large @xmath308 .",
    "it is worth mentioning the major qualitative differences between the lfi and the new instability discussed in ",
    "[ sec : numerical solutions ] that emerges for @xmath309 after the stabilization of the mri .",
    "although it is true that , for our instability to be present , it is necessary for the toroidal alfvn speed to exceed the local sound speed , there is no need to invoke alfvn speeds larger than the local rotational speed .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the lfi which only appears for @xmath310 .",
    "regarding the range of unstable wavenumbers , the lfi remains unstable for @xmath311 , albeit with diminishing growth rate for large values of @xmath312 .",
    "this is not the case for the new instability present at low wavenumbers in our study .",
    "this can be seen , for example , in the left panels in figure [ fig : approx ] .",
    "perhaps the most noticeable difference is that the two instabilities in @xcite that are present in the case @xmath313 do not seem to coexist under any particular circumstances .",
    "the instability present for @xmath314 reaches zero growth for @xmath315 , while the lfi appears for @xmath316 and its growth rate is proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "when compressibility is considered , however , the two new instabilities found in our study can coexist even for alfvn speeds smaller than the local rotational speed .      in an attempt to capture the most relevant physics without all the complexities involved in global simulations ,",
    "the shearing box approach has been widely used in numerical studies of magnetized accretion disks ( see , e.g. , hawley , gammie , & balbus 1994 ) .",
    "the aim of the shearing box approximation is to mimic a small region of a larger disk .",
    "the size of the box is usually @xmath317 , with @xmath318 the thermal scale height of the isothermal disk . in this approach",
    ", it is common to adopt a pseudo - cartesian local system centered at @xmath66 and in corotation with the disk with an angular frequency @xmath39 , with coordinates @xmath319 , @xmath320 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the effects of differential rotation are then considered by imposing a velocity gradient in the radial direction . for a keplerian accretion disk",

    "open circles in upper panels indicate unstable modes .",
    "the vertical line indicates the minimum wavenumber ( i.e. , largest wavelength ) that can be accommodated in the simulations of a strongly - magnetized corona above a weakly magnetized disk by @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in most studies of unstratified shearing boxes , alfvn speeds rarely exceed the value of the local sound speed ( see , e.g. , hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "this is mainly because they are designed to simulate the mid - plane of the disk where the flow is relatively dense . in ",
    "[ subsec : analytic approximations ] , we have seen that , as long as the toroidal alfvn speed does not exceed the critical value @xmath324 , neglecting magnetic tension due to the curvature of toroidal field lines does not seem to affect the outcome of the mri and hence the shearing box approach is well justified .",
    "however , when stratification is taken into account , usually by adopting a density profile of the form @xmath325 $ ] in the case of isothermal disks , the steep drop in the density beyond a few scale heights can potentially lead to a magnetically dominated flow , with alfvn speeds larger than the critical value @xmath326 .    as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "@xcite carried out three - dimensional mhd simulations to study the evolution of a vertically stratified , isothermal , compressible , magnetized shear flow .",
    "the simulations were local in the plane of the disk but vertically extended up to @xmath327 thermal scale heights .",
    "this allowed them to follow the highly coupled dynamics of the weakly magnetized disk core and the rarefied magnetically - dominated ( i.e. , @xmath328 ) corona that formed above the disk , for several ( 10 to 50 ) orbital periods .",
    "miller & stone ( 2000 ) considered a variety of models , all sharing the same initial physical background , but different initial field configurations .",
    "in particular , they considered the following values : @xmath329 , @xmath330 ( so that @xmath331 ) , and @xmath332 .",
    "we mention some of the results they obtained for the models with initial toroidal fields ( by ) , which were qualitatively similar to the zero net @xmath29-field ( znz ) models .",
    "after a few orbital periods , the presence of a highly magnetized ( with plasma @xmath333 ) and rarefied ( with densities two orders of magnitude lower than the disk mid - plane density ) corona above @xmath334 scale heights is evident . within both the disk and the corona , the `` toroidal '' component of the field ( @xmath335 ) , favored by differential rotation , dominates the poloidal component of the field by more than one order of magnitude ( with @xmath336 ) .",
    "we can compare the predictions of our study to the mode structure that one might expect from the standard compressible mri for the particular values of sound and alfvn speeds found in the strongly magnetized corona by @xcite .",
    "to this end , we consider as typical ( dimensionless ) values @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 , where we have assumed @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "the largest features that their simulations are able to accommodate are those with @xmath342 ( corresponding to a wavelength of 10 in the vertical direction ) .",
    "as it can be seen in figure [ fig : shearing_box ] , the role of the curvature terms is not negligible in two different respects .",
    "first , it completely stabilizes the perturbations on the longest scales well inside the numerical domain .",
    "second , the growth rate for the unstable modes is significantly reduced .",
    "it is difficult to extrapolate from the present work to address how the instabilities discussed here would couple to buoyancy in the presence of a stratified medium like the one considered by @xcite .",
    "shearing boxes might also suffer from other problems when used to model strongly magnetized plasmas ( e.g. , the shearing sheet boundary conditions in the radial direction might not be appropriate for strong fields ) .",
    "the question is raised , however , about whether , because of their own cartesian nature , they constitute a good approach at all to simulating compressible flows in which superthermal toroidal fields are present . despite the fact that the generation of strongly magnetized regions via the mri in stratified disks seems hard to avoid",
    ", their stability properties will ultimately depend on both the use of proper boundary conditions and proper accounting of the field geometry .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the role of toroidal fields on the stability of local axisymmetric perturbations in compressible , differentially rotating , mhd flows , when the geometrical curvature of the background is taken into account . in order to accomplish this task , without imposing restrictions on the strength of the background equilibrium field , we relaxed the boussinesq approximation .",
    "in particular , we have studied under which circumstances the curvature terms , intimately linked to magnetic tension in cylindrical coordinate systems , can not be neglected .",
    "we have shown that the mri is stabilized and two distinct instabilities appear for strong toroidal fields .",
    "at least for large wavenumbers , the structure of the modes seems to be the result of a purely local effect that is accounted for when compressibility and curvature terms are consistently taken into account . in particular , we have demonstrated that , even for rotationally supported cylindrical flows , both curvature terms and flow compressibility have to be considered if , locally , the toroidal alfvn speed exceeds the critical value given by @xmath343 ( in physical units ) .",
    "there is little doubt that a realistic treatment of normal modes in magnetized accretion disks has to contemplate gradients in the flow variables over large scales and should , therefore , be global in nature .",
    "the results presented in this paper , however , provide the complete dispersion relation and , more importantly , analytic expressions for some of its solutions that should be recovered , in the appropriate limit , by a study of global modes in magnetized accretion disks , where compressibility effects are likely to be non negligible .",

    "the central dispersion relation obtained in this study , i.e. , equation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) , was derived considering axisymmetric perturbations in both the vertical and the radial directions . throughout the majority of our analysis , however , we focused our attention on the modes with vanishingly small ratios @xmath124 .",
    "particular emphasis has been given to the study of these modes in the literature of weakly magnetized , differentially rotating disks , since these are the modes that exhibit the fastest growth rates @xcite .",
    "after having analyzed the role played by magnetic tension forces due to the finite curvature of strong toroidal field lines on the stability of these modes , we are in a better position to understand their effects on the modes for which the ratio @xmath124 is finite .    in figure [",
    "fig : kr_ne_0 ] , we present the solutions to the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) for three different ratios of the radial to the vertical wavenumber , i.e. , @xmath346 , and 1 . for the sake of comparison , we have used in this figure the same parameters that we used in obtaining the left panels in figure [ fig : approx ] , for which the ratio @xmath124 was considered to be vanishingly small ; we have assumed @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath220 and a keplerian disk . in all the cases , the same instabilities ( ii and iii ) that were present in the case",
    "@xmath139 can be clearly identified .",
    "note however , that even for very small ratios @xmath124 ( e.g. , left panels in figure [ fig : kr_ne_0 ] ) some of the modes that were stable in the case @xmath347 become unstable , albeit with negligible growth rate , when compared with the other unstable modes .",
    "it is also evident that in the limit @xmath125 , the mode structure in figure [ fig : kr_ne_0 ] tends continuously toward the mode structure in the left panels in figure [ fig : approx ] .",
    "it is this continuous behavior that ultimately justifies the study of modes with negligible ratio @xmath124 in a local stability analysis .    in the case",
    "@xmath348 ( right panels in figure [ fig : kr_ne_0 ] ) , the value of the critical vertical wavenumbers for the onset of instabilities , i.e. , @xmath212 and @xmath349 in equations ( [ eq : kc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kc2 ] ) respectively , are different with respect to the case in which @xmath125 by a factor @xmath350 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath108 and @xmath101 play similar roles in establishing these critical wavenumbers .",
    "the growth rates of all these modes are reduced with respect to the case with @xmath125 .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one observed in the case of weak magnetic fields .",
    "it is important to stress that , even for the modes with comparable values of vertical and radial wavenumbers , the general characteristics of the instabilities for strong toroidal fields that we discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : unstable modes ] are insensitive to the inclusion of a non - negligible @xmath101 .",
    "the completely new feature in figure [ fig : kr_ne_0 ] is the appearance of another instability with a growth rate that does not seem to depended on wavenumber ; the terms proportional to @xmath99 in equation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) are crucial for the appearance of this new instability .",
    "the mode that is unstable seems to correspond to the mode that becomes the alfvn mode in the limit of no rotation . with increasing values of the ratio @xmath124 , the growth rates of the instabilities studied in ",
    "[ subsec : unstable modes ] go to zero , but the new instability in figure [ fig : kr_ne_0 ] persists .",
    "note that for @xmath351 the growth rates of all the instabilities in figure [ fig : kr_ne_0 ] are comparable .",
    "as an aside , we point out that all the terms that are proportional to @xmath352 , as opposed to @xmath137 , in equation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) are also proportional to some factor @xmath82 with @xmath353 .",
    "all of these terms are negligible for sufficiently small ratios @xmath124 no matter how strong the toroidal field is . indeed ,",
    "if we consider perturbations with small enough radial wavelengths , at some point , curvature effects will not be important .",
    "however , this is not true in the vertical direction . in that case",
    ", we can ignore the curvature terms only when the toroidal field is weak .",
    "in the various sections of the present study , we have seen that the toroidal component of the magnetic field does play a role in determining the stability criteria .",
    "in fact , for superthermal fields and quasi toroidal configurations .",
    "it dictates the values of some of the critical wavenumbers for the onset of instabilities ( see  [ subsec : analytic approximations ] ) .",
    "a particular , simple case , in which the importance of considering both compressibility and magnetic tension terms can be appreciated , is the study of modes with negligible frequency , i.e. , with @xmath354 .",
    "we can obtain the wavenumber of these modes by imposing @xmath142 to be a solution of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp_full_nodim_kr ] ) .",

    "the alfvn speed @xmath308 appears in all three terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : k_critical ] ) and therefore it does not play a role in determining the relative magnitudes between them . unlike the second term ,",
    "the third term is not necessarily small with respect to the first one , when superthermal fields are considered . in this case",
    ", it seems again ( see  [ subsec : analytic approximations ] ) safe to neglect the curvature term proportional to @xmath357 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) .",
    "however , had we neglected the curvature term proportional to @xmath358 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_r_grads ] ) or the one proportional to @xmath359 in equation ( [ eq : pert_euler_phi_grads ] ) , we would have missed the important impact that the third term in equation ( [ eq : k_critical ] ) has on the stability of modes with @xmath360 , in the limit of strong toroidal fields ( see fig . [",
    "fig : unstable_regions_num ] ) .",
    "this is somewhat counterintuitive because there does not seem to be any _ a priori _ indication about which of the magnetic tension terms ( related to the curvature of the toroidal field component ) is less relevant in the original set of equations ( [ eq : pert_cont_grads])-([eq : pert_induc_z_grads ] ) for the perturbations .",
    "this particular example illustrates the risks associated with neglecting terms that are not strictly @xmath206 order in the perturbed quantities but rather address the geometrical characteristics of the background in which the ( local ) analysis is being carried out .    from equation ( [ eq : k_critical ] ) it is also straightforward to see under which circumstances it is safe to neglect the curvature terms .",
    "for subthermal fields , @xmath184 will not differ significantly from @xmath129 ( eq .  [ [ eq : k_bh ] ] ) regardless of the geometry of the field configuration .",
    "this is because , if the field is weak enough ( @xmath361 ) , no matter how strong of a ( subthermal ) @xmath280 component we consider , the second and third term are negligible with respect to the first one .",
    "we conclude this short analysis by commenting that , while a strong vertical field plays a stabilizing role , in the sense that it drives @xmath184 toward small values leaving all modes with shorter wavelengths stable , the consequences of considering strong toroidal fields is a little more subtle as it can be seen in the evolution of the structure of the modes in figure [ fig : comp_real ] ."
