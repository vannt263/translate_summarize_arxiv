    "understanding the nature and origin of both the dark energy @xcite and cold dark matter @xcite constitutes a significant challenge to modern cosmology . the simplest particle physics explanation for the cold dark matter is , perhaps , that of the lightest supersymmetric particle , an axion , or a heavy ( e.g. `` sterile '' ) neutrino .",
    "the dark energy , on the other hand is generally attributed to a cosmological constant , or possibly a vacuum energy in the form of a `` quintessence '' scalar field @xcite or @xmath2-essence @xcite which must be slowly evolving along an effective potential .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "in addition to these explanations , however , the simple coincidence that both of these unknown entities currently contribute comparable mass energy toward the closure of the universe begs the question as to whether they could be different manifestations of the same physical phenomenon .",
    "indeed , suggestions along this line have been made by many @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review .    in ref .",
    "@xcite yet another mechanism was considered by which a dark - matter particle could produce the cosmic acceleration . in that work",
    "it was shown that entropy production and an associated bulk viscosity could result from a decaying dark - matter particle . moreover , that bulk viscosity would act as a negative pressure similar to a cosmological constant or quintessence . however , in that paper it was shown the decay alone was not sufficient to produce the observed cosmic acceleration .",
    "it was proposed , however , @xcite that some , but not all of the desired cosmic acceleration could be accounted for if the particle decay was delayed by proceeding thorough a cascade of long lived intermediate states before the final entropy - producing decay .    in this paper",
    "we expand on the hypothesis that the dark energy could be produced from a delayed decaying dark - matter particle . here",
    ", we show that a dark - matter particle which , though initially stable , begins to decay to relativistic particles near the time of the present epoch will produce a cosmology consistent with the observed cosmic acceleration deduced from the type ia supernova distance - redshift relation without the need for a cosmological constant .",
    "hence , this paradigm has the possibility to account for the apparent dark energy without the well known fine tuning and smallness problems @xcite associated with a cosmological constant .",
    "also , for the model proposed herein , the apparent acceleration is a temporary phenomenon .",
    "this avoids the difficulties @xcite in accommodating a cosmological constant in string theory .",
    "the idea of delayed dark matter decay is not new .",
    "it was previously introduced @xcite as a means to provide an @xmath3 without curvature ( @xmath4 ) by hiding matter in weakly interacting relativistic particles . here , we point out that such a cosmology not only allows for a flat cosmology with low apparent cold dark matter matter content , but can produce an accelerating cosmology consistent with observations .",
    "we show that the bulk viscosity produced during the decay will briefly accelerate the cosmic expansion as matter is being converted from nonrelativistic to relativistic particles .",
    "this model thus shifts the dilemma in modern cosmology from that of explaining dark energy to one of explaining how an otherwise stable heavy particle might begin to decay at a late epoch .    in the next section",
    "we summarize the cosmology of late decaying dark matter and its associated bulk viscosity . in the following section we discuss candidate particles for such decays , and in section iv we present fits to the supernova magnitude - redshift relation which show that these data can be reasonably well fit in a flat @xmath5 , @xmath1 cosmology with recent dark - matter decay .",
    "we summarize the constraints that the supernova data places on the properties of the decay along with independent constraint from the ages of oldest stars and globular clusters .",
    "numerous papers have appeared in recent years which deal with the subject of bulk viscosity as a dark energy @xcite .",
    "what is needed , however , is a physical model for the generation of the bulk viscosity .",
    "below , we consider one possible means to produce a bulk viscosity in the cosmic fluid by decaying dark matter particles . to begin with , however , we first examine the effects on the cosmic acceleration of the bulk viscosity . for this purpose",
    "we utilize a flat ( @xmath6 , @xmath1 ) cosmology in a comoving friedman - robertson - walker metric .",
    "@xmath7~~ , \\label{rw}\\ ] ] for which @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a fluid with total mass - energy density @xmath11 given by , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the baryon density , while @xmath14 is the contribution from stable dark matter , @xmath15 is the energy density in the usual stable relativistic particles ( i.e. photons , neutrinos , etc . ) , and we denote the relativistic particles specifically produced by decaying dark matter as @xmath16 ( although these products may well be normal neutrinos ) .    prior to decay , by fiat @xmath17 and the other terms in eq .",
    "( [ rhotot ] ) obey the usual relations as given by the the conservation condition @xmath18 and their respective equations of state , i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 the partial pressure from each species , so that @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the initial energy densities at some arbitrary start time .",
    "we begin our models well into the time of the matter dominated epoch .",
    "hence , @xmath23 and the cosmology is nearly pressureless . however , once decay begins , the total energy density in relativistic particles @xmath24 is not negligible even at the present epoch , neither is the pressure .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath25~~.\\ ] ]    with the introduction of bulk viscosity produced ( as described below ) from decaying dark - matter particles , the energy momentum tensor then becomes @xcite @xmath26 where this last equation shows that the effect of bulk viscosity is to replace the fluid pressure with an effective pressure given by , @xmath27 thus , for large @xmath28 it is possible for the negative pressure term to dominate and an accelerating cosmology to ensue .",
    "it is necessary , therefore , to clearly define the bulk viscosity for the system of interest .",
    "the friedmann equation derives from the @xmath29 component of the einstein equation .",
    "therefore , it does not depend upon the effective pressure and is exactly the same as for a non dissipative cosmology , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath11 represents to total mass - energy density from matter and relativistic particles ( eq .  [ rhotot ] ) .",
    "even so , the bulk viscosity from particle decays can briefly affect the cosmic acceleration by producing a temporary condition of nearly constant @xmath11 .",
    "once decay begins , @xmath11 remains as given above in eq .",
    "( [ rhotot ] ) .",
    "however , the conservation equations give new equations for energy densities in decaying matter and produced relativistic particles . for @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "we then have ,    @xmath33    and @xmath34 denoting @xmath35 as the time at which decays begin , for @xmath36 we have the following analytic solutions : @xmath37 and @xmath38~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is an effective dissipated energy in light relativistic species due to the cosmic bulk viscosity , @xmath40    the total density for the friedmann equation will then include not only terms from heavy and light dark matter , but a dissipated energy density in bulk viscosity .",
    "the introduction of this @xmath41 term can lead to a cosmic acceleration as we shall see , but first , for completeness , we summarize the derivation of the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath28 given in @xcite and show how it results from the delayed decay of interest here .",
    "bulk viscosity can be thought of @xcite as a relaxation phenomenon .",
    "it derives from the fact that the fluid requires time to restore its equilibrium pressure from a departure which occurs during expansion .",
    "the viscosity coefficient @xmath28 depends upon the difference between the pressure @xmath42 of a fluid being compressed or expanded and the pressure @xmath43 of a constant volume system in equilibrium . of the several formulations @xcite the basic non - equilibrium method @xcite is identical @xcite with eq .",
    "( [ peff ] ) .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the difference between the constant volume equilibrium pressure and the actual fluid pressure .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the bulk viscosity coefficient was derived for a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature @xmath46 into which radiation is injected with a temperature @xmath47 and a mean pressure equilibration time @xmath48 .",
    "the solution for the relativistic transport equation @xcite can then be used to infer @xcite the bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "more specifically , the form of the pressure deficit and associated bulk viscosity can be deduced from eq .",
    "( 2.31 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite which we have generalized slightly and write as , @xmath49 \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^\\alpha } ~~ , \\label{weinbv}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath50 denotes a partial derivative at fixed comoving number density",
    ". the factor of 4 on the _ r.h.s .",
    "_  comes from the derivative of the radiation pressure @xmath51 of the injected relativistic particles , and the term in square brackets derives from a detailed solution to the linearized relativistic transport equation @xcite .",
    "this term guarantees that no bulk viscosity can exist for a completely relativistic gas ( for which @xmath52 ) . in the cosmic fluid , however , we must consider a total mass - energy density @xmath11 given by both nonrelativistic and relativistic components .",
    "the timescale @xmath53 to obtain pressure equilibrium in an expanding cosmology from an initial pressure deficit of @xmath54 can be determined @xcite from , @xmath55    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the present context we also have a thermalized gas into which relativistic particles at some effective temperature are injected .",
    "there are , however , some differences .",
    "for one , eq .  ( [ weinbv ] )",
    "was derived under the assumption of a short relaxation time @xmath53 so that only the terms of linear order in @xmath53 were retained in the solution to the transport equation . in",
    "what follows we will keep this form of the solution even for long relaxation times @xmath53 with the caveat that this is only deduced from a leading order approximation to the full transport solution .",
    "we will , however , also consider a phenomenological analysis of the effects of terms of higher order in @xmath53 .",
    "another difference in the present approach involves the nature of the pressure equilibration time @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , this term contains the essential physics of the bulk viscosity .",
    "there are in principle two ways in which pressure equilibrium can be restored .",
    "one is from particle collisions and the other is for simply all of the unstable particles to decay .",
    "that is , we can write an instantaneous pressure restoration lifetime @xmath56 as , @xmath57    for the cosmological application of interest here the mean collision time @xmath58 for weakly interacting ( or electromagnetic ) particles is very long ( many hubble times ) and can be ignored .",
    "hence , one only need consider the timescale to restore pressure equilibrium from the decay of unstable nonrelativistic dark matter .",
    "that is , at any time in the cosmic expansion the pressure deficit will be 1/3 of the remaining mass - energy density of unstable heavy particles .",
    "hence , we replace @xmath59 with the pressure deficit from remaining ( undecayed ) mass energy @xmath60 in eq .",

    "( [ weinbv2 ] ) into the linearized relativistic transport equation of ref .",
    "note that equation ( [ zeta ] ) implies a non - vanishing bulk viscosity even in the limit of long ( infinite ) relaxation times @xmath56 as long as the total mass energy density @xmath11 in the denominator is comprised of a mixture of relativistic and nonrelativistic particles so that the term in square brackets does not vanish .",
    "this apparent contradiction arises from keeping only the linear terms in the transport equation .",
    "hence , one should be cautious about using this linearized approximation in the long pressure relaxation - time limit .",
    "even so , a more general derivation has been made @xcite which shows that , even in the limit of interest here of a long radiation equilibration time there is a non - vanishing bulk viscosity consistent with experimental determinations .",

    "[ zeta ] with @xmath66 where @xmath67 or @xmath68 is a parameter to be adjusted to fit the cosmological data .      to illustrate how an accelerating cosmology arises we plot the evolution of various energy densities in figure [ rhoplot ] for a model with @xmath69 gyr and the onset of dark - matter decay at @xmath70 ( @xmath71 gyr ) . in this figure",
    "the dashed line shows the evolution of the energy density in relativistic particles denoted @xmath72 .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the evolution of the total matter density @xmath73 . from this figure",
    "it is evident that once the late decay begins , the sudden increase in radiation plus dissipative bulk viscosity leads to a finite period of nearly constant total mass - energy density from the onset until well past the present epoch ( at @xmath74 gyr ) .",
    "this mimics a @xmath75-dominated ( @xmath76 ) cosmology until nearly all of the unstable nonrelativistic dark matter has been converted to radiation .",
    "afterward , the total energy density continues to diminish as a radiation - dominated gas and eventually becomes a simple flat cosmology dominated by the remaining stable dark matter and baryons .",

    "the central dotted line is to aid the eye to identify and also the flattening of the total density during the decay epoch .",
    "this flattening leads to cosmic acceleration and apparent dark energy .",
    "the present age for this model ( @xmath74 gyr ) occurs at ( @xmath77 .",
    ", width=336 ]",
    "to avoid observational constraints , the decay products of any cold dark - matter particle must not be in the form of observable photons or charged particles .",
    "otherwise the implied background in energetic photons would have been easily detectable @xcite .",
    "neutrinos or some other light weakly interacting particle would thus be the most natural products from such decay .",
    "we now summarize some suggestions for this type of decaying particle .    a good candidate considered in @xcite",
    "is that of a heavy right - handed ( sterile ) neutrino .",
    "such particles could decay into into light @xmath78 `` active '' neutrinos @xcite . in this case , the limitation of decays to non - detectable neutrinos places some constraints on the sterile neutrino as summarized in @xcite .",
    "even so , various models have been proposed in which singlet `` sterile '' neutrinos @xmath79 mix in vacuum with active neutrinos ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) .",
    "such models provide both warm and cold dark matter candidates . by virtue of the mixing with active neutrino species ,",
    "the sterile neutrinos are not truly `` sterile '' and , as a result , can decay . in most of these models , however , the sterile neutrinos are produced in the very early universe through active neutrino scattering - induced de - coherence and have a relatively low abundance .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , however , this production process could be augmented by medium enhancement stemming from a significant lepton number . here",
    "we speculate that a similar medium effect at late times might also induce a late time enhancement of the decay rate .",
    "there are several other ways by which such a heavy neutrino might be delayed from decaying until the present epoch .",
    "the possibility of delayed decay by a cascade of intermediate decays prior to the final bulk - viscosity generating decay was explored in @xcite .",
    "however , this possibility was found to be incapable of accounting for all of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "here we propose that the decay of heavy neutrinos at late times requires one of two other possibilities : 1 ) a late low - temperature cosmic phase transition whereby a new ground state causes the previously stable dark matter to become stable ; or 2 ) a time varying effective mass for either the decaying particle or its decay products whereby a new ground state appears due to a level crossing at a late epoch .",
    "the first possibility was considered in ref .",
    "a suitable late decaying heavy neutrino could be obtained if the decay is caused by some horizontal interaction ( e.g.   as in the majoron @xcite or familion @xcite models ) .",
    "the decay within the familion model can be written ; @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a massless nambu - goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously broken `` family symmetry . ''",
    "the lifetime for the heavy neutrino decay then becomes : @xmath85 ^ 2 ~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the scale of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and @xmath87 is the neutrino mass .",
    "an appropriately chosen symmetry breaking scale is required @xcite to induce the decay at the desired epoch .    regarding the second possibility",
    ", a number of papers have been written @xcite which consider dark matter neutrinos with a time varying mass of ( the so - called mavan model ) .",
    "those models were proposed @xcite as a means to account for dark energy from self interaction among dark matter neutrinos . in our context",
    "we would require the self interaction of the neutrino to produce a time - dependent heavy neutrino mass such that the lifetime for decay of an initially unstable long - lived neutrino becomes significantly shorter at late times .",
    "another possibility might be a more generic long - lived dark - matter particle @xmath88 whose rest mass increases with time @xcite . this could be achieved ( for example in scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite ) by having the rest mass derive from the expectation value of a scalar field @xmath89 .",
    "if the potential for @xmath89 depends upon the number density of @xmath90 particles then the mass of the particles could increase naturally with the cosmic expansion .",
    "this could lead to a late - time instability to decay .    in another proposal @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that in string effective theories there can exist a dilaton scalar field which couples to gravity matter and radiation . in general , different particle masses will have different dilaton couplings .",
    "this can lead to dark matter with variable mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dilaton couples to radiation in the form of a variable gauge coupling .",
    "this could also lead to a variable decay rate of a long - lived dark - matter particle such that an initially neglegible decay rate quickly accelerates at some late epoch .",
    "another possible candidate may be from supersymmetric dark matter .",
    "it is now popular to presume that the initially produced dark matter relic must be a superwimp in order to produce the correct relic density @xcite .",
    "this superwimp then decays to a lighter stable dark - matter particle .",
    "one interpretation of a candidate for late decaying dark matter here , then might be a decaying superwimp with time - dependent couplings and hence a variable lifetime .",
    "alternatively , the light supersymmetric particle , might also be unstable with a variable decay lifetime",
    ". it has been proposed @xcite for example that there are discrete gauge symmetries ( e.g. @xmath91 ) which naturally protect heavy @xmath92 gauge particles from decaying into ordinary light particles so that the @xmath92 particles become a candidate for long - lived dark matter .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath92 , however is strongly dependent upon the ratio of the cutoff scale ( @xmath93 gev ) to the mass of the @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath94 from this it is apparent that even a small variation in either @xmath95 or @xmath96 could lead to a drastic speed up in the decay lifetime .",
    "having defined the cosmology of interest we now examine the magnitude - redshift relation for type ia supernovae ( snia ) .",
    "the apparent brightness of the type ia supernova standard candle with redshift is given @xcite by a simple relation for a flat @xmath1 cosmology .",

    "for now , the data slightly favor the bulk - viscosity models .    of particular interest regarding figures [ fig : mag ] , [",
    "fig : magc ] , and table 1 is the fact that a @xmath1 model can produce a reduced @xmath123 which is as good as the best fit standard @xmath75cdm cosmology .",

    "this we plan to do in a future work .",

    "we have considered models in which the present cosmic acceleration derives from the temporary insertion of dissipative mass energy due to the bulk viscosity created by the recent decay of a cold dark - matter particle into light ( undetectable ) relativistic species . as illustrative examples we have considered initially matter dominated flat ( @xmath142 ) cosmologies plus late - time particle decay .",
    "we find that models with bulk viscosity from late - time dark - matter decay are consistent with observations of the supernova magnitude - redshift relation , and ages from the oldest stars and globular clusters .",
    "we argue that it will likely satisfy other constraints as well .",
    "moreover , there is a difference in the snia magnitude - redshift relation for this cosmology compared to the standard @xmath75cdm model .",
    "this is because the deceleration is faster at high redshift due to a higher matter content during the matter - dominated epoch .",
    "thus , as more data are accumulated at the highest redshifts , it may be possible to distinguish between this cosmology and a standard @xmath75cdm model . for now , however , there is sufficient success in the present model to motivate further work . in a subsequent paper",
    "we plan to consider higher order terms in the transport equation in detail as well as the effects of such late decays on the observed power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and the growth of large scale structure .",
    "ultimately , of course , one must decide whether the dilemma of a cosmological constant with all of its difficulties is less palatable than the dilemma of a bulk viscosity produced by the delayed onset of dark - matter decay . for now , however , our purpose has simply been to establish that such a possibility exists and that it warrants further investigation .",
