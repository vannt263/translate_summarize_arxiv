    "polder interaction between microscopic particles ( atoms and molecules ) with macroscopic bodies are prototypical forces that result from quantum vacuum fluctuations of a physical quantity , in this case the electromagnetic field @xcite .",

    "polder force is usually attractive and perpendicular to the surface .",
    "however , in more complex geometries this force can be modified to a large extent .",
    "for example , surfaces with gratings can induce force components that are parallel to the ( spatially averaged ) interface .",
    "this has been shown for casimir forces between corrugated surfaces @xcite as well as for casimir  polder forces @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sign of the dispersion force can be reversed .",
    "a repulsive force with associated equilibrium , at least in the form of a saddle point , has been predicted for objects above a metal plate with a circular hole @xcite and near wedges @xcite .",

    "_ finally , we consider symmetries imposed by the geometry of the grating .",
