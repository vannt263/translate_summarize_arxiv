    "the physical region in @xmath1 invariant mass distribution for @xmath2 decay extends below the charged two - pion threshold .",
    "it means that a cusp structure should be visible in this distribution around @xmath3 , in analogy with the pronounced cusp in @xmath4 decay , observed recently by na48/2 collaboration  @xcite . in this paper , in particular , it has been shown that measuring charged kaon decays in the cusp region enables one to precisely determine @xmath5-wave @xmath6 scattering lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 , provided an accurate theoretical parameterization of the invariant mass distribution in terms of these scattering lengths is known  @xcite ( the strong impact of the unitarity cusp on @xmath9 scattering was already mentioned in ref .",
    ". moreover , the same logic applies to the neutral kaon decays into three pions , which have been studied in the recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework for analysis of the neutral kaon decays is provided in refs .",
    "@xcite and the systematic inclusion of the electromagnetic effects both in charged and neutral kaon decays is considered in ref .",
    "we further mention that the general structure of the amplitude in the neutral kaon decays is similar to the @xmath2 decay amplitude . for this reason ,",
    "e.g. , the two - loop representation of the amplitude in terms of the @xmath6 effective - range expansion parameters , derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be directly used to predict the cusp in the @xmath2 decay , which is studied in kloe , crystal ball and wasa collaboration experiments @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the two - loop formula for the kaon decay amplitudes , which was mentioned above , have been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite within the non - relativistic effective field theory framework .",
    "this framework is ideally suited for parameterizing the final - state interactions in terms of the _ @xmath6 scattering lengths _ ( effective - range parameters , in general ) , whereas the expansion of the amplitudes in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is performed in powers of the _ quark masses _ and is less convenient for expressing the amplitude in the cusp region in terms of the observable quantities .",
    "( note that , aside from the three - pion decays of charged and neutral kaons , the non - relativistic approach has been successfully applied recently to study of the @xmath10 decays  @xcite . )",
    "the aim of the present paper is to use the two - loop representation , derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , to estimate the size of the cusp in the invariant mass distribution for @xmath11 decays .",
    "this will finally allow one to judge , whether the forthcoming high - precision experiment will be able to see the cusp structure in the amplitude .",
    "note that the cusp effect in the @xmath11 decay has been addressed already in various settings , e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , we shall apply the same framework to study the experimental extraction of the slope parameter for the decay into three neutral pions . at present , the theory and experiment have not yet converged to a common denominator for this parameter .",
    "chpt at one loop in the isospin symmetry limit  @xcite predicts a different sign for this parameter as compared to the experimentally measured one . at two loops ,",
    "the sign of this quantity is no more fixed due to the large error bars coming from the unknown low - energy constants in chpt  @xcite albeit the central value is still positive ( the isospin - breaking corrections at one loop have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite and are found to be small . ) .",
    "however , the predicted sign in ref .",
    "@xcite where the calculations were done in the framework of unitarized chpt , as well as the sign emerging in dispersive calculations  @xcite , agree with the existing experimental data .",
    "we believe that in the forthcoming high - precision measurements of the slope parameter it will be very important to use as accurate a parameterization of the decay amplitude , as possible .",
    "the parameterization should be based on solid theoretical ground and , in particular , should take into account the cusp phenomenon which emerges at the physical values of the pion masses .",
    "below we mainly follow the notations from ref .  @xcite .",
    "the tree - level amplitudes are expressed in terms of the kinetic energies @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 denote the pion energies in the eta rest frame . up to the quadratic terms , @xmath15    { \\cal m}_{+-0}^{\\rm tree}&=&l_0+l_1x_3+l_2x_3 ^ 2+l_3(x_1-x_2)^2\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are the effective couplings in the non - relativistic lagrangian that describe",
    "@xmath17 decays at tree level .",
    "note that we use the same notation for these couplings as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they denote the couplings describing the 3-pion decays of the neutral kaons .",
    "assuming @xmath18 rule in the @xmath17 vertex , the isospin symmetry relates the amplitudes for @xmath11 and @xmath19 ( we use condon - shortley phase convention ) @xmath20 & -&{\\cal m}_{+-0}(s_2,s_3,s_1 ) -{\\cal m}_{+-0}(s_3,s_1,s_2)\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at tree level , this allows one to express the couplings @xmath21 through @xmath22 @xmath23 k_1&=&-(l_2 + 3l_3)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",
    "in general , @xmath17 decay amplitudes are given in a form of a sum of the tree , one - loop , two - loop ,  @xmath25 contributions @xmath26 , and similarly for @xmath27 .",
    "the pertinent ( rather lengthy ) expressions are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . we do not display them here .",
    "it can be checked that these amplitudes in the isospin symmetry limit explicitly obey the constraints  ( [ eq : constraints ] ) at one- and two - loop level .",
    "we wish to stress that the representations given in refs .",
    "@xcite should be understood as a parameterization which should be fit to the data . in other words ,",
    "the constants @xmath28 are considered as free parameters to be fixed from the fit . in this paper",
    ", we however make an attempt to _ predict _ the size of the cusp  fitting first the tree - level amplitude in order to determine @xmath22 and then using one- and two - loop representation to produce the cusp in the synthetic data . in doing this ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath29 to their theoretical values  @xcite and neglected isospin breaking in the derivative 4-pion couplings , as well as the shape parameter and the @xmath30-waves .",

    "the decay amplitude is normalized in the center of the dalitz plot @xmath39 we display the result for @xmath16 matched to the tree - level result of chpt , or to the kloe amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the resulting cusp in both cases amounts roughly up to a @xmath40 effect .",
    "we would like to mention that the sign of the cusp effect is fixed by the isospin symmetry , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : constraints ] ) and ( [ eq : constraints - tree ] ) and is thus a robust theoretical prediction .    in order to check the convergence of the method , in fig .",
    "( [ fig:2 ] ) we show the invariant mass distribution calculated at tree level , one and two loops , with the couplings @xmath22 matched to the kloe amplitude .",
    "it is seen that the shape of the cusp does not change much from one- to two - loop calculations , indicating at a rather robust prediction for a size of this effect .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] contains our prediction for the differential decay rate in the variable @xmath41  again with @xmath16 matched either to the tree - level result of chpt , or to the kloe amplitude .",
    "as expected , the slope parameter in the former case has the opposite sign as compared to the experimentally observed .",
    "apart from a small dip around @xmath42 , corresponding to the cusp , the differential decay rate is seen to be fairly linear in @xmath41 .    the convergence of the loop expansion for the differential decay rate in the variable @xmath41 and the comparison with the crystal ball data  @xcite is shown in fig .  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "as seen , the data are described quite well .",
    "using the two - loop parameterization of the @xmath17 decay amplitudes  @xcite , we have shown that the size of the cusp effect in the invariant mass distribution for @xmath11 process amounts up to around @xmath40 . despite such tiny effect",
    ", one may expect that forthcoming high - precision experiments at crystal ball , kloe and wasa - at - cosy with about @xmath43 events in the dalitz plot will be able to observe it .",
    "it is however unlikely that one could determine @xmath6 scattering lengths at a reasonable accuracy from these experiments .",
    "moreover , the cusp effect modifies the differential decay rate for the @xmath11 decay in the variable @xmath41 , producing a dip around the value @xmath42 .",
    "we expect that , in order to carry out an accurate analysis of the dalitz plot distributions , this effect should be taken into account .",
    "finally , we wish to mention that for the cusp - like structure , which has been seen recently by the crystal ball collaboration experiment at mami - c  @xcite , the _ sign _ of the effect is claimed to be different from the theoretical prediction . to resolve this contradiction , experimental study of",
