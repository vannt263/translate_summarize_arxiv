    "recently a range of ultra - cold gases with appreciable magnetic @xcite and electric @xcite dipoles have been realized in experiments .",
    "the key feature of these gases is that the constituent particles interact via a dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) that is long - ranged and anisotropic .",

    "we show that position space magnetostriction is qualitatively similar for bose and fermi gases : the gas tends to elongate along the dipole polarization direction to reduce the direct interaction energy .",
    "momentum space magnetostriction arises solely from exchange interactions and distinguishes the quantum statistics of the particles : the fermi gas momentum distribution elongates along the polarization direction , while the bose gas instead contracts along this direction .",
