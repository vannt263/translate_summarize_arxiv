    "the representation and characterization of real - world systems with complex networks has been useful to describe a large variety of systems found in the real world  @xcite .",
    "some examples include the cell , which can be described as a network of substances linked by chemical reactions , and the internet , a network of routers and computers connected by physical links  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the study of networks was mostly limited to the analysis of random graphs .",
    "one of the pioneers in graph theory was the mathematician leonard euler who , in 1736 , solved the famous problem known as the knigsberg bridges  @xcite .",
    "since then , graph theory has benefited from major advances  @xcite , mainly after the works of watts and strogatz  @xcite and barabsi and albert  @xcite on the ubiquitous properties of real - world networks .",
    "mathematically , a network is an ordered pair @xmath0 formed by a set @xmath1 of vertices ( or nodes ) and a set @xmath2 of edges .",
    "the network connectivity can be represented with an adjacency matrix @xmath3 . in this matrix ,",
    "the possible values for the element @xmath4 are 0 or 1 , where @xmath5 iff nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected .",
    "networks can be directed or undirected , a property that depends on the reciprocity of the modelled system .",
    "in addition , networks can be formed of weighted or unweighted edges  @xcite .    in the last few years , the finding that many real systems could be characterized by networks with non - trivial patterns  @xcite allowed rapid development in the area .",
    "some non - trivial patterns include the universal properties known as small - world  @xcite and scale - free  @xcite . a rapid increase in data availability and computational capacity allowed the analysis and development of efficient algorithms in several applications , including text analysis via topological characterization of networks .",
    "there are several representations of texts as networks , where both nodes and edges may represent distinct textual aspects . in the most common models ,",
    "nodes represent words and edges are established according to syntactic  @xcite , semantic  @xcite or empirical  @xcite relationships .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that the small - world and scale - free properties arise in such networks  @xcite , in many cases as a consequence of zipf s law  @xcite .",
    "a special case of syntactic networks is the word co - occurrence network ( or adjacency network )  @xcite . in this type of network ,",
    "links are established by connecting adjacent words , since most of the syntactical relations occur among neighbouring words  @xcite .",
    "the representation of texts as word co - occurrence networks has proven useful to tackle different tasks , for example , to create automatic extractive summarizers  @xcite and to identify the authorship of books  @xcite .",
    "authorship attribution methods are relevant in practice because they can be applied to classify literary works and solve copyright disputes  @xcite .",
    "the first statistical authorship attribution techniques were devised by mosteller and wallace to probe the authorship of the so - called federalist papers  @xcite . since then , many works tried to define characteristics to quantify the writing style of authors  @xcite .",
    "recent authorship attribution approaches based on networks  @xcite quantify authors writing style by using various measurements that characterize the topology of networks . in general ,",
    "the topology of a complex network can also be characterized by the number of _ motifs _ found on its structure .",
    "motifs are small interconnection patterns ( subgraphs ) forming the topology of networks .",
    "such structures have been able to characterize networks from different fields , as biochemistry , neurobiology , ecology , engineering and social networks  @xcite . in most of these areas ,",
    "specific network motifs have been found to play specific roles in the functional network activity . as a consequence",
    ", it has been shown that the prominence of particular subgraphs might be used to automatically identify the function of networks in many fields .",
    "although motifs have been used to detect universal patterns in different languages  @xcite and to perform textual analysis  @xcite , no comprehensive study has used these structures to characterize and distinguish different writing styles . in particular , we test the hypothesis that authors writing preferences can be captured in an artlessly manner via identification of network motifs . as such ,",
    "the main goal of this paper is to probe the relevance of network motifs as features for the authorship attribution problem .",
    "in a typical authorship attribution problem , a text whose authorship is unknown is assigned to an author from a set of candidates .",
    "the first authorship attribution activities supported by statistical methods are from the xix century .",
    "the goal of these methods is to maximize the probability for a text _ x _ to belong to a possible author _",
    "a_. mosteller and wallace  @xcite analysed the authorship of a collection of political essays , known as the federalist papers . with that study",
    ", they made a paramount contribution to the area showing that the frequency of common ( function ) words ( as _ and _ and _ to _ ) can distinguish different authors .",
    "the research carried out by mosteller and wallace  @xcite was based mostly on simple textual statistics .",
    "after that seminal study , researchers have been proposing new attributes in order to characterize writing styles  @xcite .",
    "some attributes traditionally used in the task include statistical properties of words ( e.g. , the average length , the frequency , burstiness and the vocabulary richness )  @xcite and characters ( frequencies and long - range correlations )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , syntactic ( for example , frequency of specific chunks ) and semantic attributes have been used as relevant attributes  @xcite .    in the context of authorship attribution , uzuner and",
    "katz  @xcite used a corpus comprising @xmath8 books .",
    "they reported accuracies between 34% and 87% .",
    "their best performance was achieved with the frequency of function words .",
    "grieve  @xcite used 34 features and analysed their performance for different sets of authors .",
    "an accuracy of 80% was reached with the frequency of words and punctuation marks using a set of 10 authors .",
    "hirst and feiguina  @xcite combined the idea of bigram frequencies with syntactic analysis .",
    "their syntactic label bigrams were found useful to distinguish the works of anne bront and charlotte bront , with an accuracy of 99.5% .",
    "jankowska et al .",
    "@xcite observed that differences in the usage frequencies of the most common n - grams of characters and words could distinguish different authors .",
    "sapkota et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that character 3-grams that capture information about affixes and punctuation marks are important features for the authorship attribution task .",
    "the dependencies between the topology of word co - occurrence networks and the writing style of authors were observed in some works  @xcite .",
    "the measurements extracted from the networks by antiqueira et al .",
    "@xcite were able to distinguish different authors .",
    "after the combination of some measurements , it was also possible to cluster different authors , characterizing a common writing style .",
    "amancio et al .",
    "@xcite obtained an accuracy rate of 65% when network measurements were combined with the intermittency of the distribution of words along the text .",
    "they found that most topological measurements captures syntactic and stylistic characteristics of the language .",
    "lastly mehri , darooneh and shariati  @xcite modelled 36 persian books as co - occurrence networks to be used in the authorship attribution task .",
    "they did not employ any pre - processing step .",
    "the authorship was correctly assigned for 28 books , which represents an accuracy of 77.7% .",
    "in addition to some measurements in complex networks , motifs are structures that can be used to characterize the topology of co - occurrence networks .",
    "motifs are recurrent interconnection patterns found more frequently in real - world networks than in randomized ones  @xcite . these structures are represented by small subgraphs , generally involving three or four nodes .",
    "milo et al .",
    "@xcite used a variety of real - world networks ( as such transcription networks , food webs and neuronal networks ) and extracted the frequency of all possible subgraphs in those networks .",
    "the frequency of each subgraph was analysed and compared to its frequency in random graphs . as a consequence",
    ", the authors discovered the significant presence of motifs in all networks .",
    "as one of their conclusions , they pointed out a structural similarity between the neuronal connectivity and the transcription networks , because these networks presented similar frequencies of their motifs . moreover , completely different frequencies of motifs were found in electronic circuits with distinct functionalities  @xcite .",
    "motifs were already used to analyse text  @xcite .",
    "milo et al .",
    "@xcite analysed the frequency of motifs in word adjacency networks from texts in english , french , spanish and japanese .",
    "despite the differences among these four languages , the authors discovered that they present very similar interconnection patterns .",
    "one possible explanation for that is that languages possess an intrinsic structure , which divides words into categories .",
    "therefore , words from one category ( e.g. prepositions ) tend to be adjacent with others from different categories ( e.g. nouns or articles )  @xcite .",
    "amancio et al .",
    "@xcite realized that some motifs , as the ones labelled as 12 and 13 in figure  [ motifs ] below , rarely happen in real texts .",
    "the dataset employed in this work comprises 40 novels , written by eight authors .",
    "the novels were published between 1835 and 1922 .",
    "we obtained electronic versions of the books from the project gutenberg repository .",
    "the full list with the @xmath9 books is summarized in appendix  [ books ] . to avoid the influence of different text lengths in the frequency of motifs and network measurements",
    ", each novel was truncated to the length of the shortest book in each scenario used in this paper .",
    "the task of modelling text as a complex network can be divided into two steps , the pre - processing of the text and the connection of words .",
    "one of the first pre - processing activities is to remove punctuation marks . in this paper ,",
    "contractions ( as _ he s _ and _ is nt _ ) were kept . we believe that the choice of writing _ is nt _ instead of its equivalent form _ is not _",
    "is related to the writing style and , therefore , this should be mapped differently in the network .",
    "one of the pre - processing steps usually applied in text analysis via networked models is the removal of function words or stopwords .",
    "these words are mainly prepositions , articles and pronouns that convey little semantic content .",
    "the set of stopwords removed in some of our scenarios is presented in appendix  [ stopwords ] .",
    "however , these words will be included in the creation of the network in some of our experiments .",
    "this is based on the fact that these words are very useful in traditional techniques of authorship attribution  @xcite .",
    "the lemmatization of the text is another pre - processing step that can be applied .",
    "it is performed with a part - of - speech tagger . in this step ,",
    "plural words are changed to their singular version , verbs to their infinitive form and names to their masculine form .",
    "after this step , words with the same lemma are mapped into the same node .",
    "the part - of - speech tagger used to perform the lemmatization process is described in  @xcite .    to demonstrate the two different pre - processing steps that will be used in this paper , table  [ preprocessingtable ] illustrates their applications in an extract of the book _ the adventures of sherlock holmes _ , by arthur conan doyle . here",
    ", these two steps will be combined and evaluated in order to find the best scenario for the authorship attribution task .",
    "l*4lr * original extract * & * without stopwords + lemmatization * + & three men wait + the door \" , said holmes .",
    " oh , indeed !",
    "& door say holmes oh indeed + you seem to have done the thing very & seem do thing + completely .",
    "i must compliment you . \"",
    "& completely must complement +  and i you \" , holmes answered .",
    "& holmes answer +      after the pre - processing steps , we need to connect each word to create the network . the written language is formed by linear chains of words ; therefore , the easiest way to represent it is to connect adjacent words .",
    "this type of network , known as a co - occurrence or adjacency network , is widely used in the literature  @xcite . in a word co - occurrence network ,",
    "words are mapped into nodes , and a link between two nodes is established if the corresponding words appear adjacent at least once in the ( pre - processed ) text .",
    "the directed network that represents the pre - processed sentences of table  [ preprocessingtable ] is illustrated in figure  [ network ] .",
    "the topological structure of a complex network can be characterized by several metrics .",
    "firstly , the directed networks derived from our dataset will be characterized by the absolute frequency of all directed motifs involving three nodes .",
    "we did not employ motifs involving more nodes because we aimed to use a small set of attributes .",
    "the set of directed motifs with three nodes is presented in figure  [ motifs ] .",
    "the frequencies were extracted with the software _ mfinder _",
    "@xcite .        in order to compare the classification results obtained with the frequency of motifs and the ones when other networked measurements are used , we extracted five measurements from complex networks .",
    "we modified the directed network to obtain its undirected version .",
    "this was easily achieved by transforming the adjacency matrix @xmath3 into its symmetric form .",
    "each one of the measurements are described below :    * average degree of neighbors ( @xmath10 ) : the degree indicates the amount of distinct neighbors .",
    "the @xmath10 quantifies the average degree of all neighbors of @xmath6  @xcite . * average shortest path length ( @xmath11 )",
    ": this measurement represents the average distance between node @xmath6 and all other nodes . in textual networks",
    ", @xmath11 quantifies the relevance of each word @xmath6 according to its distance to the most frequent words  @xcite .",
    "* betweenness centrality ( @xmath12 ) : the betweenness centrality measures the relevance of a node @xmath6 according to the number of shortest paths that include this node  @xcite . in textual networks , frequent words tend to have a high value for this measurement .",
    "in addition , some words may act as _ bridges _ ( or articulation points ) connecting concepts from different communities and thus they also may take high values of betweenness , regardless of their frequency .",
    "therefore , this measurement may quantify the diversity of contexts in which a word can be used  @xcite .",
    "* clustering coefficient ( @xmath13 ) : the clustering coefficient of a node @xmath6 indicates the probability of two of its neighbors being connected .",
    "as it happens in many small - world networks , cancho and sol  @xcite found that the clustering coefficient in textual networks is much higher than the expected value in equivalent random networks .",
    "* assortativity ( @xmath14 ) : in some networks , nodes of certain degree tend to connect with similar nodes  @xcite .",
    "this measurement quantifies the degree correlation and it can be calculated with the pearson correlation coefficient , @xmath14  @xcite . in most of the cases ,",
    "co - occurrence networks are disassortative , @xmath15 .",
    "apart from assortativity and motifs , all measurements are locally defined , i.e. a value is assigned for each word .",
    "the goal is to obtain values that can be used as global measurements of each book , not only of each single word .",
    "therefore , we adopted a summarization procedure . for each local measurement @xmath16 , the most natural choice is to calculate the average @xmath17 , i.e. the average of @xmath16 over all the @xmath18 unique words .",
    "we also computed the deviation and skewness of the distribution , denoted as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "note that this type of summarization has been performed in related studies  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the three features we use for each measurement @xmath21 are :    @xmath22    @xmath23}^{1/2 } , \\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath24      in order to quantify the ability of the motifs to distinguish among authors , we employed four machine learning algorithms to induce classifiers from a training set .",
    "the techniques are _ support vector machines _ , knn , _ naive bayes _ and c4.5  @xcite .",
    "we used the default configuration of these methods available in weka  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the default configuration of parameters in weka provides near optimal performance for most of the cases  @xcite .",
    "these methods were applied to a training set independent of the test set using the cross validation technique with 10 folds  @xcite . in this technique , at each cycle one tenth of the books are used as test while the other nine tenths are used for training the algorithm .",
    "as we described in section  [ preprocessing ] , different pre - processing steps may be applied before creating the network of each text . for each one of our experiments",
    ", we considered four different input scenarios : ( i ) original text , ( ii ) without stopwords , ( iii ) after the lemmatization process and ( iv ) after the removal of stopwords and the lemmatization process . for each input scenario",
    ", we derived one network for each book . in the first experiment ,",
    "the absolute frequency of all thirteen motifs was extracted .",
    "finding the set of motifs of size 3 is computationally feasible .",
    "the average time to extract all motifs in scenarios ( ii ) and ( iv ) was around 30 seconds per book .",
    "the derived networks in scenarios ( i ) and ( iii ) have more nodes and edges and , therefore , the time to extract the motifs increased to an average of 4 minutes per book .",
    "we applied the machine learning methods described in section  [ patternmethods ] .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ motifresultsdirected ] . in these results ,",
    "the function words play an important role during the extraction of the motifs because the overall performance drops to very low values when such very frequent words are disregarded .",
