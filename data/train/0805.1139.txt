    "in this paper we develop a model that allows us to predict quantitatively the absorptive and dispersive properties of rubidium vapour probed in the vicinity of the @xmath0 lines   transition is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the principal quantum number of the valence electron , and the @xmath6 transition is @xmath7 . ] , and compare the predictions with an experimental study of the absolute doppler - broadened absorption spectrum . in alkali - metal atoms the @xmath0 lines have a high oscillator strength , and from an experimental perspective rubidium and cesium",
    "are ideal species as they have sufficient room temperature vapour pressure to yield large absorption ( 10 - 50% ) in cells of modest length ( 5 - 7  cm ) .",
    "in addition , for these atoms the @xmath0 lines occur at wavelengths where inexpensive and reliable diode laser sources exist .",
    "these transitions are frequently studied in atomic physics ; the @xmath2 transition is used extensively in laser - cooling experiments  @xcite , whereas non - linear optical processes such as electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite and chip - scale atomic magnetometers  @xcite are realized with the @xmath6 transition .",
    "controlling the propagation of light through a medium by modifying its absorptive and dispersive properties is a flourishing area of research  @xcite . having a model which calculates the absorption and refractive index of a doppler - broadened medium is useful for predicting the magnitude of relevant pulse propagation properties , a topical example being the group delay which enables construction of an all - optical delay line  @xcite or a slow - light fourier transform interferometer  @xcite . a model which predicts absolute absorption",
    "has a number of applications e.g. in analysing eit spectra  @xcite .",
    "absolute absorption spectroscopy can yield the number density of the sample being studied and has many applications in physics , chemistry , metallurgy and industry @xcite ; when applied to the measurement of different spectral lines the populations of occupied levels are revealed , from which a temperature can be deduced @xcite .",
    "in addition , rb and cs spectroscopy is frequently used for generating a signal used for frequency reference (  locking \" ) of a laser .",
    "understanding the evolution of the absorption profile aids in the decision of , e.g. which temperature to use to maximise the signal  @xcite .",
    "the importance of using a weak probe in order to maximise the absorption will be highlighted below .",
    "many laser - lock schemes have signals which have a non - trivial dependence of signal amplitude on absorption , e.g. , polarization spectroscopy  @xcite or the dichroic atomic vapour laser lock ( davll ) @xcite .",
    "the choice of which probe power to use is a trade - off between two competing effects : a weak probe beam ensures that the largest absorption is obtained , whereas higher probe power gives a better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a detailed model of the absorption and refractive index for the doppler - broadened rb @xmath8 transition , and to compare the expected spectral dependence of the absorption with experimental data .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows : section  [ absorption ] explains how to calculate the expected doppler - broadened spectra for rb atoms on the @xmath0 lines ; section  [ experimental ] describes the experimental apparatus and details of the methodology used to measure the absorption profile ; section  [ results ] presents and discusses the results , and finally , in section  [ conc ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the absorption of monochromatic light as it propagates along the @xmath9direction through a uniform density atomic vapour is given by the beer - lambert law :    @xmath10 , \\label{eq : beer}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the intensity of light at position @xmath12 inside the medium with an absorption coefficient @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the beam intensity at the entrance of the medium .",
    "the absorption coefficient is dependent on the frequency , @xmath15 , of incident light and the temperature , @xmath16 , of the medium .",
    "we assume that the probe beam is sufficiently weak that the absorption coefficient is independent of intensity . a full discussion of how weak the light has to be for this simplification to be valid is given in section  [ hyperpump ] .",
    "the transmission , @xmath17 , of a beam through a medium of length @xmath18 is defined as    @xmath19    in general , a medium consists of multiple species , each with multiple transitions .",
    "a beam of light will interact with all species according to    @xmath20 , \\label{eq : totaltransmission}\\ ] ]    where the total absorption coefficient , @xmath21 is the sum over @xmath22 , the absorption coefficient for each transition for each species .",
    "the macroscopic absorption coefficient of the medium can be written  @xcite in terms of @xmath23 , the microscopic atomic absorption cross - section and @xmath24 , the number density of the atomic gas , @xmath25 .",
    "there are two reasons why the medium s absorption coefficient is temperature dependent : ( i ) the atomic cross - section is influenced by the doppler width , proportional to the square root of the temperature ; and ( ii ) the number density is a strong function of temperature .",
    "doppler broadening of the spectral lines is dealt with in section  [ velocity ] , and the temperature dependence of the atomic density in appendix a.    we label each hyperfine state of the atom with the usual angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath26 for the @xmath27 term , and @xmath28 for the @xmath29 or @xmath30 term , where the subscript @xmath31 denotes the ground ( excited ) state . for a multi - level atom , such as rubidium ,",
    "the calculation of the atomic cross - section is in two parts : first , the relative linestrengths among the different @xmath32 transitions are calculated , then the absolute value is deduced .",
    "these calculations are facilitated by initially assuming the atoms are at rest , with the manifestation of atomic motion ( doppler broadening ) incorporated later .",
    "we neglect pressure broadening in these calculations .",
    "gorris - neveux _ et al .",
    "_ measured the rb - rb collisional self - broadening to be of the order of @xmath33  hz @xmath34  @xcite ; for the temperature range spanned in this work the pressure broadening is at least four orders of magnitude less than the natural broadening . for temperatures greater than approximately @xmath35c",
    "the self - broadening becomes comparable to the natural width .      in order to predict the absorption spectrum the relative spacing of the hyperfine - resolved energy levels for both rb isotopes",
    "are needed .",
    "zero detuning frequency for @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) is set to be the centre of mass frequency of the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) transition in the absence of hyperfine splitting , taking into account the natural abundance of each isotope .",
    "the atomic energy level intervals were obtained for @xmath2 from @xcite and for @xmath6 from @xcite .",
