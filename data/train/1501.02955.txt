    "recently , it is shown that extended de gennes theory should be used in the case of semi - flexible polymers when @xmath2 @xcite . here , @xmath3 is the monomer width .",
    "most of the studies on confined polymers focus on double - stranded dna , which is a semi - flexible polymer . recently",
    ", single stranded dna is introduced as a model system for study on flexible polymers @xcite .",
    "also , many proteins and synthetic polymers are flexible . for flexible polymers ,",
    "the only relevant theory is the de gennes blob model and it would be useful to better understand its limitations and regime of applicability .",
    "the blob model has broad applications in different problems of polymer physics , such as polyelectrolytes @xcite , polymers under tension @xcite , and polymers adsorbed to surfaces @xcite or confined near surfaces unfer external fields @xcite .    in the blob model , the confined polymer",
    "is divided into smaller sections , called @xmath4 , that have the size of the confining geometry , @xmath0 .",
    "inside blobs , polymer does not feel that it is confined .",
    "the number of monomers inside each blob is found from the relations of the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) in free space , @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the flory exponent in 3d and @xmath7 is the monomer size .",
    "in length scales larger than the blob size , the polymer ( with @xmath8 real monomers ) behaves like an effective polymer with @xmath9 monomers of size @xmath0 .",
    "this effective polymer has a saw in one or two dimensions for a nano - channel or a nano - slit , respectively .",
    "the number of monomers inside each blob , @xmath10 , and total number of the blobs , @xmath9 , should be large enough , to be able to use the relations of statistical mechanics for saw inside or outside the blobs , respectively @xcite .",
    "a number of studies on confined polymers are performed in conditions that the above two requirements are not satisfied .",
    "it is shown that the blob model is applicable in micro - devices , where the number of blobs is very small @xcite .",
    "also in some practical situations , the polymer is confined in severe conditions that the number of monomers inside each blob is very small @xcite . specially in nano - devices for dna barcoding ,",
    "full stretching of dna is required @xcite .",

    "a flexible polymer confined inside a nano - slit is studied using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "the extreme condition that the number of monomers inside each blob is small is considered .",
    "it is shown that our results for the radius of gyration and confinement free energy of the polymer can be explained very well , using the blob model . despite previous studies ( ref . @xcite and references therein )",
    ", no correction is made to the slit width ( distance between the two plates ) .",
    "agreement between simulation results and the blob model is observed even for very narrow slits with 1 - 2 monomer(s ) width .",
    "these widths are completely below the regime of applicability of the blob model .",
    "extension of the polymer inside the nano - slit has fluctuations around its mean value . from these fluctuations , an effective spring constant can be obtained .",
    "it is a dynamic variable for the polymer and is a measure of elasticity of the polymer .",
    "our results for the effective spring constant are in good agreement with the blob model , unlike the case of the polymer inside the nano - channel @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the difference between the origins of the effective spring constant of a polymer confined in a nano - channel and a nano - slit .",
    "two factors govern the fluctuations of a polymer confined in a nano - slit : fluctuations in the size of blobs and fluctuations in the self - avoiding walk of the blobs .",
    "it is obvious that the latter factor is dominant .",
    "however , for a polymer confined in a nano - channel , the blobs are arranged one after the other along the channel .",
    "so , fluctuations in the blob size are the only source of fluctuations in the extension of the polymer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "this makes the internal dynamics of the blobs important , in the dynamics of the whole polymer . as a result",
    ", it is determining to have the sufficient number of monomers inside each blob , for a polymer confined inside a nano - channel .    in the next section",

    "finally , a summary of the results is presented in the last section .",
    "consider a flexible polymer confined between two parallel plates ( fig . [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "confinement extends the polymer on the walls , to a radius of gyration larger than its free radius of gyration @xmath11 . here , @xmath8 is the number of monomers of the polymer , @xmath7 is the monomer size and @xmath12 is the flory exponent in 3d .",
    "sections of the chain smaller than the distance between the plates , @xmath0 , do not feel the constraints .",
    "these sections , called blobs , have a statistics similar to a chain in free space @xmath13 , where @xmath10 is the number of monomers inside each blob .",
    "the polymer is composed of @xmath9 blobs that can not penetrate into each other .",
    "so , it can be regarded as an effective two - dimensional polymer with @xmath9 monomers of size @xmath0 .",
    "we use the exponent of a self - avoiding walk in two dimensions , @xmath14 , to find the extension of the polymer parallel to the plates @xmath15 .",
    "this gives the relation between the average extension of the polymer with the total number of monomers and the distance between the plates ,    @xmath16    free energy of confining the polymer is @xmath17 per blob , @xmath18 .",
    "substituting @xmath10 in this relation gives    @xmath19    the force exerted on the plates is found by differentiating the confinement free energy with respect to d , @xmath20    the polymer has fluctuations around its average extension .",
    "the mean square deviation from the average extension is described by an effective spring constant @xmath21 .",
    "the simplest way to calculate the spring constant , @xmath22 , is to eliminate @xmath0 between the relations [ equi - ext ] and [ equi - energy ] .",
    "this gives the free energy as a function of extension .",
    "differentiating the polymer free energy twice with respect to its extension and substituting the equilibrium extension gives a spring constant @xcite .",
    "this calculation does not give a correct result , because equation [ equi - energy ] is the free energy of the polymer at its equilibrium extension .",
    "indeed , the free energy of the polymer for any desired extension should be used in the calculation .",
    "suppose the two ends of the confined polymer are under tension and it is elongated to the extension @xmath23 .",
    "free energy of a two- or three - dimensional polymer with @xmath8 monomers of size @xmath7 which is extended to size @xmath23 is @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is equal to @xmath25 for 3d and equal to @xmath26 for 2d . by differentiating this free energy twice with respect to @xmath23 and substituting the equilibrium extension @xmath27 ,",

    "this is in agreement with the relation used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", the confined polymer is described as an effective polymer with @xmath9 monomers of size @xmath0 in two dimensions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "so , the spring constant becomes @xmath29 .",
    "substituting for @xmath10 , we get the spring constant for the confined polymer @xmath30 in the final relation , @xmath31 is substituted from eq .",
    "[ equi - ext ] . to derive this relation ,",
    "the confined polymer is simply modeled as an effective two - dimensional polymer composed of blobs and the effect of the external tension is to move the confinement blobs toward a linear alignment .",
    "this simple description is valid for small tensions with @xmath32 .",
    "the blob model is accurate when the number of monomers inside each blob , @xmath10 , and total number of the blobs , @xmath9 , are considerable .",
    "this is necessary to be able to use statistical mechanics relations for a self - avoiding walk inside and outside the blobs , respectively .",
    "the size spanned by a self - avoiding walker in space is proportional to the number of steps to the power of the flory exponent in two or three dimensions , when the number of steps is large enough . for @xmath10 to be large enough , the confining geometry ( nano - slit or nano - channel ) should be much larger than one monomer size .",
    "it is instructive to compare the effect of an external tension on a polymer confined inside a nano - channel or a nano - slit .",
    "prior to tension , the polymer inside the nano - slit arranges its blobs in two dimensions .",
    "the effect of the external tension is to move the blobs toward a one dimensional arrangement .",
    "however , the blobs of the polymer inside a nano - channel have already lost two degrees of freedom and lie on a one dimensional line .",
    "so , the polymer has to stretch its blobs to respond to the external tension .",
    "one can conclude that the elasticity of a polymer inside a nano - slit has its origin in the arrangement of the blobs .",
    "this is in contrast to the elasticity of a polymer inside a nano - channel which originates from the elasticity of each blob . as a result , to use the blob model for the former case",
