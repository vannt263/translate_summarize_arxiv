    "aerial robotics are getting integrated into a wide variety of critical applications . among the most promising ones ,",
    "is that of infrastructure inspection and maintenance operations  @xcite .",
    "aerial robots correspond to a safety  ensuring , efficiency  improving and cost  saving asset that can revolutionize this field . within such missions , one of the most challenging problems  alongside those of perception , estimation and control  is that of being able to autonomously derive the inspection path which handles the structural and spatial distribution properties of the infrastructure , is efficient and respects the often tight endurance limitations of the vehicle as well as any sensor or kinematic  constraints that apply . especially in the case of distributed infrastructure",
    "such as wind farms , solar panels , oil rigs or the power network the complexity of this problem is particularly high .",
    "the work presented in this article augments in terms of results the paper in  @xcite and deals exactly with the problem of distributed infrastructure inspection path planning for aerial robotics that are subject to time constraints .",
    "the new algorithm considers the fact that given a set of spatially distributed _ infrastructure facilities of interest _ ( ifis ) and a robot with time constraints , intelligent inspection path planning should aim to derive the best _ possible _ path and not be constrained on a potentially infeasible attempt to find a full  coverage solution .",
    "therefore , the proposed algorithm considers an _ exploration function _ ( ef ) for each ifi as well as an _ importance weight _ ( iw ) and aims to compute the path that maximizes the totally collected _ inspection rewards _ ( irs ) ( combination of iws and efs ) while respecting the vehicle endurance or other mission time constraints , as well as the vehicle motion and sensor limitations .",
    "it is highlighted that the algorithm is free to select the partial structural inspection of a subset of the spatially distributed ifis as long as this maximizes the totally collected ir given that the imposed time constraints do not allow complete inspection of all ifis . to the authors best knowledge , there is only a small body of research activities trying to address this problem in an autonomous manner despite its importance for robotic inspection operations .",
    "subject to specific limiting assumptions , this problem shares certain similarities with the orienteering problem ( op ) class . considering constant , time independent , inspection rewards",
    "it can be solved using methods for op  @xcite . assuming a time  only dependent and nondecreasing learning curve , the problem shares similarities with the traveling tourist problem ( ttp ) and the planning of optimal tourist itineraries given trip time constraints  @xcite .",
    "however , in practice the exploration function for a structure is not a single function of time since two equal duration inspection paths that start at different points or follow different directions can lead to largely different coverage percentages .",
    "this fact further increases the complexity of the problem .",
    "the proposed algorithm is specifically designed to be able to deal with this situation and employs an iterative @xmath1step optimization paradigm , within which it randomy samples a subset of the facilities that should be visited and partially or fully inspected _ ( first step ) _ , subsequently solves the derived traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) and computes the travel costs _ ( second step ) _ , and finally _ ( third step ) _ samples and assigns inspection times and subsets of the full  coverage path of each ifi that respect the time constraints and then evaluates the overall gained inspection reward .",
    "the computation of the full  coverage path per ifi is achieved by interfacing another inspection path planner that is capable of computing optimized inspection paths for a single structure .",
    "any relevant path planner can be employed for this task , while within the framework of this work , an algorithm previously proposed and open  sourced by one of the authors is employed  @xcite .    the proposed approach is thoroughly analyzed using both simulation as well as experimental studies that employ the autonomous aerial robot shown in figure  [ fig : intro_photo ] .",
    "computational analysis is provided with a detailed description of the breakdown of the computational cost for each main algorithmical step .",
    "the collected dataset from the experimental studies and a large family of simulation results are publicly released in order to allow easier future comparison with other methods and strategies proposed by the research community  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm will also be open ",
    "sourced including the interfaces to the employed single structure inspection planner with the aim to release a public and complete infrastructure inspection path  planning framework .",
    "the distributed structural inspection path planning problem is defined in section  [ sec : problem ] , followed by the detailed description of the proposed approach in section  [ sec : approach ] .",
    "finally , evaluation studies are presented in section  [ sec : evaluation ] , while conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the problem of distributed infrastructure structural inspection path planning subject to time constraints , as considered in this paper , consists of a ) a set of spatially distributed _ infrastructure facilities of interest _ ( ifis ) that are modeled using @xmath0 meshes , and each of them is associated with an _ inspection reward _ ( ir ) that is computed as the multiplication of the _ importance weight _ ( iw ) and the _ exploration function _ ( ef ) ,",
    "b ) a time constraint ( either due to the endurance of the robot or mission  specific limits ) , c ) dynamic constraints of the vehicle as well as d ) sensor field  of  view ( fov ) limitations . assuming that for each ifi , an _ admissible _ full  coverage path exists and can be computed using a dedicated single structure inspection path  planner ( ssip ) , the goal is to maximize the total collected irs by finding the best combination of a subset of ifis to be visited , associated inspection times for each ifi and corresponding subsets of its full  coverage inspection path , as well as the tour among the selected ifis .",
    "note again , that the problem of ssip is decoupled and addressed by interfacing a relevant solver such as the one previously proposed by one of the authors  @xcite . in the following",
    ", the addressed problem is defined more formally while the basic notation is also introduced .",
    "let @xmath2 be a graph , where @xmath3 is the set of vertices each one corresponding to the couple of entry and exit pose configurations of the coverage path of one ifi @xmath0 structure @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the corresponding arc set .",
    "note that incoming connections to a vertex @xmath6 are attached to the entry point of the coverage path of the ifi @xmath7 while outbound connections start from the exit point of the coverage path .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 is the set of ir functions for each of the ifis vertices with @xmath9 being the iw and @xmath10 is the ef as a function of the inspection time @xmath11 and starting point @xmath12 in the full  coverage path @xmath13 of @xmath7 , and @xmath14 is the transition time associated with each arc @xmath15 .",
    "the subset of the full  coverage path @xmath13 that starts from @xmath12 and has a duration @xmath11 for a maximum travel speed @xmath16 is denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "now let a feasible solution to the problem be the 5tuple @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the hamiltonian path among the sampled vertices @xmath20 associated with the sampled ifis set @xmath21 and the arc set @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the sampled subsets of the full  coverage paths for the selected ifis and @xmath24 is the relevant set of inspection rewards .",
    "the optimal solution to the problem is the 5tuple @xmath25 such that :    @xmath26 note that not only the aforementioned time constraint of the mission should be respected but also the dynamic constraints of the vehicle and the limitations of the sensor as part of the selected ssip calculations and the boundary value solver ( bvs ) that is employed for the vehicle dynamics and will be explained in the next section .",
    "the proposed distributed infrastructure structural inspection planner _ ( disip ) _ is overviewed within this section .",
    "it relies on an iterative , @xmath1step optimization strategy that allows it to compute inspection paths that improve the gained inspection reward while respecting the imposed time constraints . within each iteration ,",
    "the three steps executed are : a ) random sampling of a subset of the possible ifis to be inspected , b ) solution of the derived tsp problem and finally c ) randomized assignment of inspection times ( up to the limit of the time constraint ) and corresponding subsets of the full  coverage path for each sampled ifi .",
    "as this procedure runs iteratively , the algorithm manages to provide improved solutions over the course of time , while a first solution is available from the first run .",
    "these steps are summarized in algorithm  [ alg : disip_algorithm ] while the most important functions are detailed in the subsequent sections .",

    "planner ( ssip ) that is capable of computing a complete coverage path for a given connected structure as well as a sensor model and vehicle kinematic constraints . given the maximum travel speed for inspection @xmath28 and max yaw rate @xmath29 , the computed full coverage path is timed at each step .",
    "different ssip algorithms can be used , while within this work the algorithm previously proposed by one of the authors  @xcite is employed both due to its performance as well as due to its open  source availability .",
    "the algorithm is executed once per ifi type , considers a triangular mesh representation of the structure and computes the path via an optimization method that alternates between two steps , namely a step that samples and computes new viewpoints in order to reduce the cost  to  travel between each viewpoint and its neighbours , and a step that computes the optimal connecting tour for the current iteration .",
    "the specific planner supports both rotorcraft as well as fixed ",
    "wing aerial vehicles and accounts for their different motion model .",
    "furthermore , its computational cost is particularly small due to the convexification of the viewpoint computation problem and the utilization of the lin  kernighan  helsgaun ( lkh ) solver for the tour computation step .",
    "computational analysis is included in the relevant publication  @xcite , while demo scenarios and experimental datasets are available online .      within the ifis set @xmath30 and the associated graph vertices @xmath31 , the subsets @xmath32 , @xmath33",
    "are randomly sampled at each iteration @xmath34 .",
    "the rest of the steps of the disip algorithm are now executed based on this set of ifis and the corresponding graph @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the set of all possible connections between the members of @xmath37 .",
    "the paths among all @xmath38 are computed via the utilization of a two state bvs applicable to rotorcraft aerial robots .",
    "this bvs is employed to connect two @xmath39 based on the start and end points of the corresponding sampled inspection path of the two ifis @xmath40 respectively ( asymmetric connections ) .",
    "it is noted that the employed bvs of a rotorcraft aerial robot consists of position as well as yaw @xmath41 , while as long as low speeds are considered , roll and pitch are approximated to be zero .",
    "consequently , the path from configuration @xmath42 to @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the two limitations considered are the maximum translational velocity constraint @xmath46 and the yaw rate constraint @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting execution time is @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the euclidean distance .",
    "the cost of a path segment within the disip algorithm execution corresponds to its travel  execution time @xmath50 .",
    "this calculation is conducted for all possible connections between the sampled ifis of any iteration and the corresponding cost matrix @xmath51 is derived . as a remark ,",
    "it is noted that a local collision  free point  to  point navigation algorithm such as rrt@xmath52 may be used to avoid collision with the ifi from which a connection departs , arrives or other ifis in between .",
    "given the cost matrix @xmath51 , the next goal is to compute the hamiltonian path @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the arc set of the hamiltonian path .",
    "essentially , at this step the algorithm derives the solution to the ( possibly asymmetric ) tsp problem of visiting the sampled vertices @xmath37 of the sampled ifis set @xmath55 . among the multiple algorithms that have been proposed for the tsp , the approach of lin ",
    "kernighan  @xcite and its methodology of implementation by keld helsgaun ( lkh solver )  @xcite corresponds to the best known local search algorithm solution .",
    "the lkh solver relies on the concept of @xmath56optimality , according to which a tour is said to be @xmath56optimal ( or simply @xmath56opt ) if it is impossible to obtain a shorter tour by replacing any @xmath56 of its links by any other set of @xmath56 links .",
    "similarly , a @xmath56opt neighborhood for tour @xmath57 , @xmath58 , consists of all tours which can be constructed by deleting and adding @xmath56 edges . based on the observation that two hamiltonian cycles only differ in @xmath56 edges ( @xmath59 ) ( @xmath60 the sampled number of ifis at the @xmath34th iteration ) , i.e. @xmath61 and in order to address the problem that @xmath56optimality can be tested in @xmath62 while @xmath56 is unknown",
    ", lkh employs the alternative of choosing an _ efficient searchable _ neighborhood such that @xmath56 can be chosen dynamically .",
    "this is the concept of _ sequential _",
    "moves_. more formally , a @xmath56opt move is called sequential if it can be described by a path alternating process between deleted and added edges .",
    "the code implementation of the lkh solver is found online at  @xcite .",
    "using such a solver , the derived tsp problem from the sampled graph @xmath63 is computed , leading to the tour @xmath64 ( the solution to the problem of finding the hamiltonian path @xmath65 ) which represents the sequence based on which the sampled ifis should be visited as well as the travel costs of this route @xmath66 .      for each ifi @xmath7 ,",
    "a ssip path @xmath13 is computed , has @xmath67 number of points and @xmath68 path segments , traveled in time based on the same bvs described above .",
    "given the overall ssip path duration @xmath11 of each ifi , an inspection time @xmath69 for each ifi @xmath70 and disip iteration @xmath34 is sampled while accounting that the overall assigned time @xmath71 should be less than the available time @xmath72 . as by random sampling ,",
    "a set of @xmath73 that would overall lead to @xmath74 exactly is unlikely , an additional step of adjusting the assigned times by an amount proportional to the ratio of the sampled @xmath73 and leads to the satisfaction of the aforementioned equation takes place . based on the @xmath73 values , the algorithm further samples an entry @xmath75 point to each of the ssip paths @xmath13 as well as an exit point @xmath76 such that the corresponding subset of the ssip path @xmath77 has an overall duration time as close as possible ( given the discrete points of the ssip path ) to @xmath73 .",
    "minor adjustments ( interpolation ) may take place afterwards to account for the discretized nature of the ssip paths .      for a ssip path @xmath13",
    ", each point corresponds to a viewpoint configuration that covers a specific subset of the ifi structure model ( one of its triangular mesh faces ) .",
    "therefore , for the sampled subset of each ssip path @xmath77 , the overall covered area of the ifi @xmath78 can be computed , which then allows the computation of the coverage ratio @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 the overall area of the @xmath81th ifi ) .",
    "once this value is computed for all sampled inspection paths for the given set of ifis within the @xmath34th iteration , the inspection reward of each path is derived as @xmath82 .",
    "finally , the total inspection reward is computed as @xmath83 .",
    "if this reward is higher than the previous best value @xmath84 , then the @xmath34th iteration of the algorithm is considered as the so ",
    "far best solution and the reward value gets updated @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , the elements of this best disip solution @xmath86 are exported .",
    "note that this 5tuple contains the information for the best tsp tour @xmath87 within the hamiltonian path @xmath88 .      at this final step , which is performed after the execution of all the iterations of the disip algorithm , the ssip paths @xmath89 and the connecting segments of the tsp tour @xmath90 are combined to form the overall disip path .",
    "this connected timed path @xmath91 is the result used for the guidance of the aerial robot .",
    "the proposed solution to the problem of distributed infrastructure structural inspection path planning subject to time constraints is motivated from the need to provide high  quality inspection paths that respect all the constraints , are computed fast , while given that more time is available for the mission preparation , updated and improved solutions can be found .",
    "the algorithm does not possess the feature of optimality , it however produces high quality paths that make use of all the time that is available to the robot even from the first solution .",
    "as each iteration requires a very short computation time , its iterative execution quickly leads to paths of very high quality .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm makes no constraining assumption on the nature of the exploration function and uses any possible full  coverage path for each of the distributed structures from which it extracts subsets based on the sampled time assignments .",
    "to the authors best knowledge this is the first attempt of its kind while the provided simulation and experimental studies further demonstrate its efficiency and suitability for the problem .",
    "in order to enable thorough evaluation of the properties and performance of the proposed distributed infrastructure inspection path planner , a wide set of evaluation test  cases both in simulation as well as using experimental studies were considered . within those ,",
    "the goal is to assess the quality of the inspection path for different spatial sparsity and distribution of the infrastructure as well as different robot endurances or mission time constraints and finally the computational properties of the algorithm .",
    "the experimental studies were conducted using a quadrotor mav that is capable of autonomous navigation using a visual  inertial localization and mapping framework  @xcite .      in order to evaluate the properties of the disip algorithm and especially the quality of the inspection paths for different levels of spatial sparsity of the ifis , we followed a process of creating multiple randomized distributed infrastructure scenarios .",
    "all scenarios consist of a combination of four ( @xmath92 ) different infrastructure facilities and more specifically , a ) a solar  panels park , b ) a vessel tank , c ) a turbine storage and a d ) distribution network power transformer .",

    "furthermore , it is pointed out that for the smaller scenarios , an aerial robot with an endurance of @xmath101 , a traveling speed @xmath102 , and inspection speed @xmath103 and a yaw rate constraint @xmath104 was considered ( values achievable by a large multirotor ) , while for the larger scenarios the endurance was set to @xmath105 ( achievable by a gasoline  powered helicopter uav ) . regarding , the assumed on  board camera sensor , all scenarios were conducted assuming a fov of @xmath106 in both dimensions . without loss of generality , all importance weight ( iw ) factors except those refering to the solar panel park",
