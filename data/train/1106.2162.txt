    "cosmological observations now provide overwhelming evidence that about @xmath6 of the energy density of the universe is some unknown form of cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "the most popular candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) which can produce the correct relic abundance after freeze out , @xmath7 a natural candidate for wimp dark matter arises in extensions of the standard model with low - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) and @xmath8-parity .",
    "in such models the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is automatically stable and generically has mass on the order of the weak scale @xcite .",
    "the ` wimp miracle ' is the statement that a particle with a mass and annihilation cross section typical of the weak scale will automatically yield a relic abundance that is within a few orders of magnitude of the observed value .",
    "this paradigm has been challenged by recent direct detection searches for wimps . in particular",
    ", xenon100 recently set the most stringent upper limit on the spin - independent elastic wimp  nucleon scattering cross section , @xmath9 , for a @xmath10 gev wimp at 90% confidence @xcite .",
    "this large discrepancy between the necessary annihilation cross section and the direct detection bound is increasingly difficult to explain in the usual wimp dark matter scenarios .",
    "for example , within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , one must typically tune parameters in order to explain this difference @xcite .",
    "a standard approach is to consider parameters in which @xmath11 is suppressed below direct detection constraints . at generic points in the parameter space",
    "this will also imply a suppressed annihilation cross section and thus a relic abundance that is too large . in order to overcome this problem one needs to assume special relations among a priori unrelated parameters in order to boost the annihilation rate .",
    "for example , a pure bino lsp would require coannihilation ( due to an accidental slepton degeneracy ) or resonant annihilation to obtain the correct annihilation cross section @xcite .",
    "alternately , the observation that higgsinos and winos have annihilation cross sections that are typically too large allows one to tune the lsp to be a specific combination of bino , higgsino , and wino to generate the correct abundance @xcite .",
    "this ` well - tempered neutralino ' scenario , however , is now strongly disfavored by xenon100 @xcite .    in light of this tension ,",
    "it is natural to consider non - minimal susy models in which    * the wimp is a weak scale lsp , * the direct detection cross section is suppressed while maintaining the correct relic abundance without any fine tuning , and * the experimental prospects in near future include novel collider signatures .",
    "we therefore extend the mssm by a new sector with an approximate global symmetry which is spontaneously broken in the supersymmetric limit . a natural wimp candidate that satisfies the above criteria",
    "is the fermionic partner of the goldstone boson which we refer to as the _ goldstone fermion _ , @xmath12 .",
    "this particle can naturally sit at the bottom of the spectrum because it lives in the same chiral supermultiplet as the goldstone boson @xmath13 and is thus protected by goldstone s theorem and susy .",
    "even when susy is broken , the goldstone fermion can remain light with mass at or below @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this scenario is a weak scale version of axino dark matter @xcite ; for an early attempt containing similar elements see @xcite .",
    "similar realizations also appear in dark matter models where the lsp has a large `` singlino '' component @xcite ; such models can reproduce the mass spectrum of goldstone fermion dark matter but do not have a limit where the global symmetry is broken while susy is exact .",
    "in particular the singlino dark matter effective interactions do not come from an effective low - energy khler potential as discussed in section [ effective_kahler ] .",
    "further , due to singlino  higgsino mixing , such models typically require tuning to avoid direct detection bounds .",
    "the susy non - linear sigma model is a generic low - energy theory of the goldstone supermultiplet based only on the symmetry breaking pattern @xcite .",
    "it can be organized as an expansion in inverse powers of the symmetry breaking scale , @xmath15 . in particular",
    "the leading order contribution to dark matter annihilation is controlled by a trilinear derivative coupling @xmath16 . if the global symmetry is anomalous with respect the sm gauge group , the goldstone bosons will , in turn , decay to stable sm particles , @xmath17 .",
    "all the interactions can be perturbative and compatible with gauge coupling unification if the mediators of the anomaly come in complete gut multiplets .",
    "if the goldstone fermion mass @xmath18 is around the weak scale and the symmetry breaking scale @xmath15 is around the tev scale , then the resulting annihilation cross section is automatically in the thermal wimp range @xmath19 the freeze - out temperature @xmath20 is insensitive to details of the model and appears because @xmath21 is a @xmath0-wave process .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking at @xmath22 , the cp - even scalar component of the goldstone chiral multiplet mixes with the higgs boson and generates an effective @xmath23 coupling which is suppressed by @xmath24 . while standard higgsino - like dark matter in the mssm gives a large direct detection cross section , goldstone fermion scattering off nuclei lies just below the xenon100 bound , @xmath25 note that this suppression factor in @xmath11 is roughly of the same order as the suppression needed in the annihilation cross section for a standard weak - scale wimp , @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 , to obtain the correct abundance ( [ abundance_intro ] ) .    finally , goldstone fermion dark matter has novel consequences on higgs phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "the global symmetry requires a derivative coupling between the goldstone boson and the higgs boson @xmath29 .",
    "if kinematically allowed , the higgs boson decays into four light unflavored jets , @xmath30 , with a sizeable branching ratio .",
    "this decay mode is ` buried ' under the qcd background .",
    "such non - standard higgs decays have recently been investigated in susy models motivated by the little hierarchy problem @xcite . for goldstone fermion dark matter , the higgs",
    "might only be ` partially buried ' with a branching ratio of 30% to the standard model .",
    "alternately , one can hope to discover the goldstone boson itself by looking for the @xmath31 decay .",
    "together with the direct detection of its fermionic superpartner , such a discovery would be strong evidence that the dark matter particle emerges because of the goldstone mechanism and susy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the effective low - energy theory of a goldstone supermultiplet in section [ goldstones ] and extend this by including susy and explicit global symmetry breaking in sections [ susy_breaking_sect ] and [ sec : w : from : explicit : breaking ] .",
    "readers who are primarily interested in dark matter phenomenology can proceed directly to sections [ abundance_sect ] and [ sec : direct_indirect_detection ] , where we review ( in)direct detection prospects and calculate the relic abundance .",
    "we discuss the lhc phenomenology in section [ colliderpheno ] . in appendix",
    "[ app : models ] we present simple models that realize this scenario .",
    "details of the annihilation cross section calculation are given in appendix  [ appannihilation ] .",
    "remarks on a possible sommerfeld enhancement are presented in appendix  [ app : sommerfeld ] .",
    "we consider a supersymmetric gauge theory with a global u(1 ) symmetry that is broken by fields @xmath32 which obtain vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath33 . in the limit of unbroken supersymmetry",
    ", the theory has a massless goldstone chiral superfield , @xmath34 which is the low - energy degree of freedom of the high - energy fields , @xmath35 where the effective symmetry breaking scale is @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the u(1 ) charge of @xmath38 .",
    "we refer to the component fields as the _ goldstone boson _ @xmath13 , the _ sgoldstone _ @xmath1 , and the _ goldstone fermion _ @xmath12 . in models where the u(1 ) is a peccei - quinn symmetry ,",
    "these are typically called the axion , saxion , and axino , respectively .",
    "the mass of the cp - odd scalar @xmath13 is directly protected by the goldstone theorem while the @xmath1 and @xmath39 masses are , in turn , protected by supersymmetry .",
    "the goldstone boson shift symmetry acts on the chiral superfield as @xmath40 .",
    "it is thus often convenient to consider a non - linear realization of the goldstone chiral superfield , @xmath41 , which naturally transforms under the u(1 ) shift symmetry , @xmath42 . in the absence of explicit global symmetry breaking , this shift symmetry forbids any superpotential term involving @xmath43 .",
    "the shift symmetry restricts the dependence of the khler potential on the goldstone superfield to take the form @xmath44 we have written @xmath45 to denote light fields which are uncharged under the global symmetry .",
    "note this general form includes the canonical term @xmath46 which is @xmath47 up to a khler transformation .",

    "the @xmath57 coefficient is particularly important for the dark matter abundance since it controls the size of the @xmath58 vertex .",
    "the tree - level contribution to @xmath57 can be determined by comparing ( [ eq : kahler : metric : a ] ) to the canonical khler potential of the high - energy fields @xmath38 , @xmath59 note that in the absence of explicit u(1)-breaking terms , @xmath43 does not get a vev and @xmath60 is canonically normalized with respect to the goldstone superfield .",
    "all goldstone self - interactions are calculable from the physical khler metric , @xmath61 in particular , the tree - level contribution to the @xmath62 coefficient is given by @xmath63 note that @xmath57 is invariant under overall charge scaling .",
    "in simple models with just two fields @xmath64 of opposite charge , @xmath57 is bounded , @xmath65 .",
    "in general , however , there is no such restriction on @xmath57 in theories with more fields or with dynamical u(1 ) breaking .",
    "even though the mssm fields are uncharged under the global symmetry , they may couple to the spontaneously broken sector through higher - order terms in the khler potential",
    ". we will particularly be interested in the coupling of the goldstone multiplet with the higgs doublets @xmath66 .",
    "explicit symmetry breaking terms can generate superpotential couplings between the mssm and the goldstone sector ; these are discussed in section  [ sec : w : from : explicit : breaking ] .",
    "the khler potential interactions between the higgses and the goldstone superfield can be parameterized by expanding in @xmath54 , @xmath67 note that the first term vanishes if there is a @xmath68 discrete symmetry @xmath69 .",
    "the presence of such symmetry depends on the choice of uv completion . a mixing between the higgs and the sgoldstone arises , for example , from the khler metric term @xmath70 the @xmath71 terms",
    "can also give rise to mixing if the sgoldstone also gets a vev of order @xmath72 .",
    "after rotating the higgs and sgoldtone fields , the coupling between @xmath73 and the goldstone multiplet appears in the effective lagrangian as @xmath74 \\left(1+b_1\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{f}s+c_h \\frac { v_{\\text{ew}}}{f^2 } h+\\ldots\\right ) + \\ldots\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 is a function of the coefficients @xmath76 and the higgs sector mixing angles .",

    "where @xmath83 , the goldstone fermion has a small higgsino component roughly given by @xmath84 .",
    "the khler terms involving the other mssm matter fields are typically more suppressed .",
    "assuming minimal flavor violation to control flavor - changing neutral currents , these terms take the form @xmath85 the suppression scales @xmath86 are not necessarily related to the global symmetry breaking scale @xmath15 , and can be much larger depending on the uv completion of the theory .",
    "we assume that soft susy breaking terms which simultaneously break the u(1 ) global symmetry are negligible .",
    "the remaining soft terms generate an explicit sgoldstone mass , but leave the goldstone boson massless .",
    "the goldstone fermion may only get a mass from the superpotential or from @xmath87-terms via mixing with gauginos . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the latter possibility so that the fermion mass matrix is the second derivative matrix of the superpotential , @xmath88 while the superpotential terms are u(1 ) invariant and supersymmetric , a goldstone fermion mass can still be induced if the vacuum is shifted from its supersymmetric value due to the presence of soft breaking terms .",
    "the u(1 ) invariance of the superpotential implies @xmath89 so that the goldstone fermion @xmath90 is indeed a zero mode of the fermion mass matrix when none of the u(1)-charged @xmath91-terms obtain a vev @xcite .",
    "the mass of the goldstone fermion then depends on whether the u(1)-charged fields pick up @xmath91-terms in the presence of soft breaking terms @xcite : @xmath92 if the superpotential has an unbroken @xmath8-symmetry which is left unbroken by the soft terms , then @xmath12 necessarily carries @xmath8-charge @xmath93 and a majorana mass is prohibited - symmetry . ] . in particular , soft scalar masses always preserve @xmath8-symmetry and hence can not generate a goldstone fermion mass in the @xmath8-symmetric case . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath43-terms are holomorphic and generically break @xmath8-symmetries .",
    "thus @xmath43-terms are expected to always contribute to the goldstone fermion mass , while soft scalar masses may or may not contribute .",
    "the effect of @xmath43-terms is equivalent to the mixing between the @xmath91-terms between u(1)-charged fields and the susy breaking spurion @xmath94 . for concreteness",
    ", we consider gravity mediation with @xmath95 .",
    "it was recently emphasized in @xcite that @xmath96 type mixing terms are always expected and will contribute a mass of order @xmath97 to the goldstone fermion .",
    "indeed , such mixing terms arise from higher dimensional khler terms of the form @xmath98 using the technique of analytic continuation into superspace @xcite , one may absorb @xmath99 into a redefinition of the chiral superfields @xmath100 this canonically normalizes @xmath60 and generates soft terms that include the @xmath43-terms @xmath101 these terms completely incorporate the mixing between @xmath91-terms of the form @xmath102 .",
    "the goldstone fermion mass is determined by the induced @xmath103s obtained by minimizing the scalar potential , @xmath104 to summarize this section , we find that @xmath43-terms will always contribute to the goldstone fermion mass .",
    "assuming that @xmath105 for all @xmath106 , the generic size of the induced @xmath91-terms is @xmath107 and , consequently , the induced goldstone fermion mass is @xmath108 . in many situations the @xmath43-terms",
    "can be suppressed relative to other soft breaking terms and it is thus reasonable to expect that the goldstone fermion remains lighter than the other superpartners .",
    "soft scalar masses may also contribute .",
    "if they do , their contribution to the @xmath103 is expected to be of order @xmath109 so that the contribution to the goldstone fermion mass is of order @xmath110 , which again can easily be suppressed .",
    "the shift symmetry forbids any superpotential for the goldstone chiral multiplet @xmath43 . in order to generate a small goldstone boson mass",
    "one must include terms which break the global symmetry .",
    "these can come from an anomaly in the global symmetry or through explicit breaking terms .",
    "if the global symmetry is anomalous then the triangle diagram generates a @xmath111 term which fits into a superpotential term @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the field strength chiral superfield for the gauge group g which has a u(1)g@xmath114 anomaly . in practice",

    "sources of explicit global symmetry breaking terms can be parametrized by spurion chiral superfields @xmath140 which carry charge @xmath141 under the global symmetry and obtain a vev @xmath142 , where @xmath143 .",
    "this permits a superpotential term @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "unbroken supersymmetry requires that there are two sources of global symmetry breaking , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , with opposite charges , @xmath148 .",
    "this produces a sgoldstone boson vev and an effective superpotential with a common supersymmetry preserving masses @xmath149 .",

    "after susy breaking , the sgoldstone boson and the goldstone fermion masses are lifted while the goldstone boson remains light , @xmath152 .",
    "up to integration by parts , the the on - shell trilinear axial coupling @xmath153 is equivalent to an effective @xmath57 coupling in ( [ lagrangian_self ] ) . finally , the explicit breaking can also generate additional terms in the superpotential of the form @xmath154 these lead to mixing with the higgs and decays to sm fermions .",
    "the goldstone fermion @xmath12 is a natural dark matter candidate if it is the lsp and produces the observed abundance @xcite , @xmath155 where @xmath73 is the hubble constant .",

    "goldstone fermion dark matter can also be produced from the cascade decay of heavier @xmath8-parity odd particles , such as gluinos or squarks .",
    "due to the small coupling between the mssm and the goldstone sectors , the cascade decays will all go through the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle ( losp ) .",

    "the details of the decay modes depends on the nature of the lsp .",
    "for example , a bino - like losp will decay to the lsp via the anomaly , @xmath274 .",

    "for example , the natural width for a pure bino losp is around @xmath278  gev .",
    "finally , the presence of exotic heavy fermions @xmath32 also has interesting implications at colliders . these fermions may be considered to be `` fourth generation '' quarks which , if they are sufficiently light , can be probed at the early stages of the lhc ( see the discussion in @xcite for an example ) .",
    "+      the largest natural coupling of the goldstone boson and fermion to the sm is through higgs boson via the kinetic terms , ( [ higgs_coupling ] ) .",

    "such non - standard higgs boson decays have recently been investigated in susy models where the higgs boson itself is also a pseudo - goldstone boson emerging from the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry .",
    "in particular , the spontaneous breaking of @xmath281 gives rise both to a light goldstone multiplet @xmath43 and a light higgs multiplet @xcite .",
    "the resulting coupling @xmath282 is set by the kinetic mixing between the two multiplets which , in turn , is fixed by the scale @xmath15 of the global symmetry breaking .",
    "a more recent example of a ` buried higgs ' in susy has been discussed in the context of a spontaneously broken @xmath283 symmetry where @xmath75 depends on couplings in the superpotential because the higgs is no longer a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "even though these non - standard goldstone fermion decay modes can dominate , the branching ratio to sm particles is still larger than @xmath284 at low higgs masses and therefore the lep bound on the higgs mass can not be lowered below @xmath285  gev .",
    "furthermore , while the discovery of a completely buried higgs is challenging at the lhc @xcite , this ` partially buried ' higgs would be discovered in sm channels with a missing piece in the total width .",
    "the invisible higgs boson decays ( @xmath12s leave the detectors ) can be probed at the lhc through the missing energy signal @xcite .",

    "acceptable dark matter scenarios within the mssm must become increasingly contrived as the sensitivity of direct detection experiments increases . in order to remain consistent with recent xenon100 results",
    ", neutralino wimp models must typically invoke accidental mass relations to boost the annihilation cross - section through co - annihilations or strategically placed resonances .",
    "inspired by this tension , we have explored a general supersymmetric framework compatible with gut unification in which the lsp is the fermionic component @xmath12 of a goldstone supermultiplet associated with a u(1 ) global symmetry that is spontaneously broken at the tev scale . because the goldstone fermion s couplings to the standard model are suppressed by @xmath286 ( and additional loop factors in some cases ) , these models are able to avoid direct detection constraints from xenon100 and indirect detection constraints from fermi and pamela .",
    "the annihilation cross section of a weak - scale goldstone fermion at freeze out is on the order of 1 pb , with dominant contributions coming from @xmath0-wave annihilation into goldstone bosons . typically subdominant @xmath1-wave annihilations into gluons arise through anomalies of the new global symmetry .",
    "the observed dark matter relic density is obtained with natural values for the model parameters .",
    "this class of models also offers novel and distinctive signatures at colliders .",
    "goldstone fermions can be produced at the lhc in pairs through the anomalous coupling to gluons , leading to monojet signals when there is additional hard qcd radiation from the initial state .",
