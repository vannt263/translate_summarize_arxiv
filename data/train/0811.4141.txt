    "qcd simplifies in the t  hooft limit of a large number of colors , and as a result it has been a long - standing goal to understand the properties of the theory in that limit  @xcite , including on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "one alternative to conventional large volume simulations is the use the large-@xmath2 equivalence of qcd at large volume to qcd with zero volume @xcite ( see also the related ref .",
    "these large-@xmath2 volume reductions allows one , in principle , to study very large values of @xmath4 with modest resources .",
    "volume reduction holds only if the ground states of the large and zero volume theories respect certain symmetries  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the most interesting case of qcd in four dimensions these symmetries spontaneously break in the continuum limit when a naive reduction prescription is used @xcite .",
    "an extension of that prescription is thus required and for a recent summary of the literature on this topic we refer to the reviews in the recent refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of two space - time dimensions  the  t hooft model  a naive large-@xmath2 volume reduction is expected to hold and so this theory is generally thought to be completely independent of its volume . in the current paper we analyze this volume dependence .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "firstly , the  t hooft model is analytically soluble at large-@xmath2 .",
    "thus we can explicitly see how large-@xmath2 volume reduction works in this case , and what may cause it to fail .",
    "this topic was also addressed for zero baryon number by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , and our treatment here differs from that paper by being manifestly gauge invariant , by going beyond zero baryon number , and by using the lattice regularization .",
    "our approach also makes a direct connection with eguchi - kawai reduction , and shows how the expectation values of spatial polyakov loops play a crucial role in the validity of volume independence .",
    "secondly , this paper is a prelude to our companion publication ref .",
    "@xcite where we use the formalism presented here to solve the theory in the presence of nonzero baryon density . considering the current incomplete understanding of the way four - dimensional qcd behaves at low temperatures and large ( but not asymptotic ) baryon densities",
    ", we believe that such a study is useful .",
    "also , there exist certain confusions in the literature about the way large-@xmath2 gauge theories behave at nonzero baryon number @xcite , and seeing how these confusions go away in the soluble two - dimensional case is very helpful .",
    "surprisingly , qcd in two dimensions and nonzero density has not been solved yet : while ref .",
    "@xcite studied only one and two baryons in an infinite volume , then ref .",
    "@xcite attempted to extend this but restricted to either ( 1 ) translational invariant states which were seen to be inconsistent , or ( 2 ) a particular translational non - invariant ansatz for a baryon crystal in the vicinity of the chiral limit .",
    "since @xmath0-dimensional baryons become massless for massless quarks , it is natural to expect that they behave very differently than four - dimensional massive baryons .",
    "furthermore , most of the current literature on the  t hooft model has so far focused on its infinite volume limit where a certain set of gluonic zero modes are irrelevant . with a finite density of baryons ,",
    "however , these become important and can not be neglected ( at least if the density is increased by fixing the baryon number and decreasing the volume ) . thus , given the current status surveyed above , it seems wise to study the dense ",
    "t hooft model for arbitrary quark mass , by making as few assumptions on the form of the ground state as possible , and by incorporating correctly the gluonic zero modes . in this paper",
    "we develop the machinery to achieve this goal . for the actual solution of the theory for arbitrary baryon numbers we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and for all other discussions on the way nonzero chemical potential affects the system to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "former studies of the  t hooft model used a plethora of mathematical methods  for example see @xcite for some papers relevant to this work .",
    "common to all these is the need to control the severe ir divergences of this two - dimensional model .",
    "a particular clear approach , that we will follow in our study , is the one advocated in the seminal refs .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", one works in the hamiltonian formalism defined in a spatial box of side @xmath1 , and uses the axial gauge to remove all redundant degrees of freedom .",
    "this approach is also most suitable for our purpose of investigating the @xmath1-dependence of this hamiltonian s ground state .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ lqcdh ]",
    "we present the details of the hamiltonian approach to lattice qcd . a reader who is familiar with this approach can skip to section  [ haxial ] where , by generalizing refs .",
    "@xcite to the lattice , we show how to fix the axial gauge in the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "since such gauge fixing is less familiar than the gauge fixing in the euclidean formalism , we do so in detail .",
    "in section  [ glresolve ] , we show how to resolve gauss law and re - write the electric fields in terms of the fermion color charge densities .",
    "this rewriting can be done for all components of the electric field except for those conjugate to the eigenvalues of the spatial polyakov loops .",
    "this set of eigenvalues and their conjugate electric fields is what we refer to above as zero modes , and in section  [ 0mode ] we focus on them .",
    "specifically , we show how to represent the zero modes electric fields in the schredinger picture as differential operators .",
    "the end result of sections  [ lqcdh]-[hrecap ] is a hamiltonian that depends only on the fermions and on the zero - modes , with an overall color neutrality enforced on its hilbert space . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we summarize this emerging structure in section  [ hrecap ] .",
    "we then turn to find the ground state of this hamiltonian . at large-@xmath2",
    "this is done in two steps : ( 1 ) solution of the gluon zero modes dynamics - discussed in section  [ sectorg ] .",
    "( 2 ) solution of the fermion sector - section  [ sectorf ] . in the second step we use the coherent state approach of refs .",

    "t hooft classical hamiltonian describing color neutral operators that correspond to quark - antiquark pairs and polyakov - loops ( that wrap around the spatial circle ) , and that interact in the presence of a fixed overall baryon number . in section  [ otherworks ] we survey other relevant works in the literature that obtain a similar hamiltonian , pointing out the way they differ from our approach . in section  [ decompact ]",
    "we analyze the resulting hamiltonian and its @xmath1 dependence for arbitrary baryon number @xmath5 .",
    "we show how large-@xmath2 volume dependence emerges and that for it to hold we need to assume that the ground state has some degree of translation invariance .",
    "we also show how it can be violated by giving the polyakov loops nonzero expectation values .",
    "an interesting phenomena occurs when the ground state contains a baryon crystal and we show how a ` soft ' form of volume independence emerges .",
    "this leads us to remark on the way our results affect studies of nonzero chemical potential that try to rely on large-@xmath2 volume independence .",
    "we conclude in section  [ summary ] by noting some general lessons one can learn about the way large-@xmath2 qcd behaves in the presence of baryons .",
    "in this section we introduce the hamiltonian formalism of lattice qcd restricted to one spatial dimension and one flavor . a reader familiar with this formalism",
    "can skip to section  [ haxial ] .",
    "this hamiltonian of lattice qcd was first introduced by kogut and susskind in 1975 @xcite , shortly after wilson s euclidean formulation .",
    "this canonical formalism defines the theory of strong interactions on a spatial lattice with lattice spacing @xmath6 and continuous time @xmath7 . in one dimension a lattice site is denoted by a single index @xmath8 taking integer values .",
    "we also use @xmath8 to denote the lattice link that is to the right of the site @xmath8 . because we define the theory on a finite box we set @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of lattice sites , and @xmath1 the physical length of the box .",
    "the boundary conditions of the gauge fields are taken to be periodic . in this section and throughout the paper we use standard lattice notations and so the factors of the lattice spacings are implicit and all fields are dimensionless .",
    "the quantum fields that describe quarks are the fermion fields @xmath11 that live on the sites @xmath8 of the lattice .",
    "they have color indices @xmath12 , and dirac indices @xmath13 ( again , recall we are in @xmath0 dimensions ) .",
    "the fermi fields obey the following anti - commutation relations @xmath14    choosing to work in the temporal gauge that fixes @xmath15 removes one degree of freedom ( and its conjugate momentum ) .",
    "this leaves the spatial gauge field operators @xmath16 living on the lattice link between @xmath8 and @xmath17 .",
    "for definiteness we note that the operator @xmath18 is _ defined _ to be equal to @xmath19 , and so the following holds as a operator identity @xmath20 the conjugate momenta of the @xmath21 s also reside on links and are denoted by @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",

    "we also write it as a direct product of the form @xmath52 next , we denote the state with no electric field @xmath53 by @xmath54 , @xmath55 any application of the link operators @xmath56 on @xmath54 , creates states which correspond to flux lines on the link @xmath8 .",
    "the state @xmath57 is the only state with no flux at all .",

    "in this section we show how to fix the axial gauge . since axial gauge fixing in the hamiltonian approach is less familiar than it is in the euclidean approach we begin with an explanation of the general strategy .",
    "temporal gauge fixing left us with a hamiltonian that is invariant under time - independent gauge transformations discussed in the previous section . with no external charges",
    "the generator of such transforms needs to vanish on physical states and this gives rise to a set of local and global gauss - law constraints that the quantum fields and their conjugate momenta need to obey . of these constraints ,",
    "the local ones can be solved ( and will be solved in the next section ) and consequently a large subset of the gauge fields conjugate momenta is written in terms of the fermion color charges . the fact that these momenta become non - dynamical implies that their conjugate gauge fields are not physical and can be removed from the hamiltonian .",
    "these are the fields that , in the action formalism , can be ` gauged away ' .",
    "indeed , from the path integral formalism we know that in a compact system of one spatial dimension almost all gauge fields can be gauged away .",
    "the only gluonic modes that remain are those corresponding to a constant spatial gauge field .",
    "furthermore , one can gauge away all but the @xmath113 independent eigenvalues of this zero mode .",
    "anticipating a similar scenario in the hamiltonian approach , one expects that the following fermionic hamiltonian will be the remnant of the hamiltonian after the axial gauge fixing : @xmath114 here we denote by @xmath115 the @xmath116 eigenvalues of the constant spatial gauge field operator .",
    "clearly , to get from one needs to remove all but the eigenvalues of the spatial polyakov loops operator from the system . using a sequence of a change of variables , this is easy to do in the path integral approach .",
    "but in the hamiltonian there seems to be a conceptual difficulty with such a process : the degrees of freedom we wish to gauge away are represented by quantum operators and it is not clear how to ` gauge them away ' .    to proceed we choose to generalize , to the lattice , the formalism constructed in the seminal ref .",
    "the general idea is to find a hilbert space realization of a unitary operator @xmath117 that will rotate quantum states into a basis where the hamiltonian looks like . to do",

    "specifically , we write @xmath215 in terms of the new wave function the vandermond disappears from the measure and the kinetic term becomes the simple quadratic form ( here we rescaled @xmath216 ) : @xmath217 this will be our final simplified form for the zero mode contribution to @xmath218 .",
    "to conclude let us write the lattice hamiltonian @xmath92 in terms of the operators that can not be gauged away .",
    "it describes the interactions between the lattice fermions @xmath219 and the eigenvalues of the spatial polyakov loop @xmath179 , and is given by @xmath220 here the primed sum in means we that we should not sum over terms whose denominator is zero ( for the derivation of this restriction see section [ glresolve ] ) . from here on we discard the lower component of the fermions , and so discuss the staggered fermions formulation of lattice qcd @xcite ( this also means that we need to replace the r.h.s .",
    "of by @xmath221 , and choose the number of lattice sites , @xmath222 , to be even ) .",
    "the reason we choose to work with staggered fermions is two - fold .",
    "firstly , these one - component grassmann variables are simpler to treat in our formalism and the computational effort involved in the numerical minimization of their classical hamiltonian ( for details see @xcite ) is a factor of two smaller than for the naive prescription of fermions considered above .",
    "secondly , unlike the situation in four dimensional euclidean calculations , staggered fermions in the one dimensional hamiltonian approach are ` un - doubled ' and correspond to a single dirac fermion in the continuum limit .",
    "finally , the hilbert space of the system obeys the following :    * the operators @xmath223 are , for each value of the color index @xmath12 , constants and equal to @xmath221 .",
    "in this section we use the coherent state approach to study the ground state properties of the hamiltonian in its large-@xmath2 limit . this approach is summarized in refs .",
    "@xcite and we refer to these papers for detailed discussions , while here we only describe its strategy .    the main paradigm that underlies the coherent state approach is that qcd , in its large-@xmath2 limit , becomes a classical theory .",
    "limit when all other parameters are fixed .",
    "these includes the volume @xmath1 , the temperature @xmath224 , the mass @xmath225 , the  t hooft coupling @xmath226 , and the baryon number @xmath5 . ]",
    "this means that instead of diagonalizing its quantum hamiltonian , one can instead minimize a corresponding classical function @xmath3 , referred to as the ` classical hamiltonian ' .",
    "the minimization is done with respect to a set of coordinates , @xmath227 , that corresponds to expectation values of gauge invariant operators .",
    "the coherent state approach provides the mathematical prescription for calculating the function @xmath228 and it is shown to be given by @xmath229 here @xmath230 is the so called ` coherent state ' obtained by applying a unitary color singlet operator , that we denote by @xmath231 , on an arbitrary color singlet element @xmath232 of hilbert space , the so called ` reference ' state : @xmath233 the operator @xmath234 is a functional of gauge invariant operators like spatial wilson loops of contour @xmath235 @xmath236 as well as spatial wilson loops decorated by a single insertion of the electric field matrix operator @xmath237 , at point @xmath8 along the loop , i.e. @xmath238 ( the two operators that appear in are different since the electric fields do not commute with the gauge fields ) .",
    "also , in the presence of fermions , @xmath234 depends on string - like operators of the form @xmath239 where here @xmath240 is a string of gauge field operators connecting site @xmath8 with site @xmath241 .",

    "indeed @xmath244 , and @xmath245 parameterize this lie group and furnish coordinates on its manifold .",
    "more precisely , the fermionic part of the coherence group is parameterized by the fermionic coordinates @xmath246 , and the gluonic part by @xmath247 and @xmath248 . is unitary ,",

    "kept fixed , the minimization of @xmath3 process proceeds in two steps : one begins by minimizing the leading @xmath254 contribution of @xmath228 . at",
    "leading order the latter is equal to the classical function @xmath255 given by the classical hamiltonian of the pure gauge theory @xmath256 where the operator @xmath257 is given in and @xmath258 is a reference state in the pure gauge system .",
    "this step sets the value of the expectation values of the gluonic color singlet operators such as the spatial polyakov loops . for brevity ,",
    "let us refer to these expectation values by the generic symbol @xmath259 , and by @xmath260 to their value at the minimum of @xmath255 .",
    "next , one minimizes the @xmath261 contribution to @xmath3 . to leading order",
    "it is given by calculating the expectation value of @xmath262 from eqs .",
    "( [ h_f ] ) and ( [ hc ] ) in the subset of coherent states whose gluonic coordinates have already been determined by the gauge dynamics .",
    "this contribution is thus given by @xmath263 with @xmath264 denoting a fermionic reference state .",
    "this two step process reflects the dominance of the gauge field dynamics over the fermion dynamics . indeed",
    "the back - reaction of the fermions on the gauge fields comes from terms which we do not consider in this work and that are subleading in @xmath265 .",
    "this is true as long as there is no enhancement of these @xmath265 terms by massless modes , which we assume to be the case .",
    "for our purposes it will be easier to simply calculate @xmath266 and substitute the set of expectation values @xmath259 by its value in the _ exact _ ground state of @xmath257 .",
    "the latter is known analytically and we repeat its derivation in section  [ sectorg ] .",
    "the solution of the fermion sector , however , is done as described above and we calculate the classical function @xmath267 in section  [ sectorf ] .",
    "we now turn to make the following remark on the way @xmath3 is calculated and minimized . as mentioned above , the coordinates @xmath227 corresponds to expectation values of different color singlet operators .",
    "more accurately , one can focus ones attentions to expectation values of only ` non - factorizable ' operators such as the string operators of . naively , however , one might expect that @xmath3 should also be minimized with respect to coordinates that correspond to expectation values of ` factorizable ' operators such as @xmath268 this , however , is incorrect : at large-@xmath2 the expectation values of such operators factorize , and for example , @xmath269 as a result , the expectation values of factorizable operators become determined by the expectation values of the non - factorizable operators and should not be thought of as independent coordinates that parameterize the coherent state manifold or the point within that manifold that represents the ground state .",
    "the unique role of non - factorizable operators operators is also reflected by the structure of the unitary operator of eqs .",
    "( [ udef1][udef3 ] ) which depends only on such operators . indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that to generate the whole coherence group , it is sufficient to include in its algebra only the non - factorizable operators that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ udef1][udef3 ] ) . adding other operators",
    "greatly complicates the algebra of the coherence group and is unnecessary .",
    "an important result of the discussion above , which we wish to emphasize , is that the coherent state @xmath230 defined in is sufficiently general to look for all possible large-@xmath2 ground states .",
    "put differently , the form in does _ not _ correspond to assuming an ansatz for the ground state of the gauge theory .    in the next two subsections",
    "we show how to implement the program outlined above in practice .",
    "we begin in section  [ sectorg ] with the treatment of the pure gauge case that allows us to calculate the expectation values of the color singlet gluonic operators , namely the traces of different powers of spatial polyakov loops .",
    "the pure gauge hamiltonian in our two - dimensional case is sufficiently simple that we can do so exactly and for any value of @xmath2 .",
    "the next step is to apply the coherent state approach to the fermionic part of the hamiltonian and we do so in section  [ sectorf ] .",
    "the solution of the pure gauge sector is well known @xcite .",
    "the starting point is to notice that means that the gauge wave functions need to be anti - symmetric to an exchange of two angles , and for odd values of @xmath2 , periodic in @xmath270 : @xmath271 these properties , together with the form of the hamiltonian , tell us to think of the @xmath120 as the positions of @xmath2 non - relativistic fermions with mass @xmath272 , moving on a circle with periodic boundary conditions and a fixed center of mass .",
    "the single particle wave functions of such a system are the plane waves @xmath273 with @xmath274 , and the ground state wave function of this @xmath2-fermion system is , up to a phase , the @xmath275 slater determinant obtained by occupying momentum states distributed symmetrically around zero and limited by ` fermi momenta ' @xmath276 : @xmath277 this wave function is an eigenstate of @xmath257 with eigen - energy that has the large-@xmath2 limit of @xmath278 .",
    "it is easy to show that this determinant differs from the vandermond determinant by a phase that depends only on the ` center of mass ' of the fermions , @xmath279 , and in @xmath26 we set this phase to zero .",
    "the result is @xmath280 and so when we calculate expectation values of gauge invariant gluonic operators @xmath281 we need to perform the following integral ( here we set the normalization such that @xmath282 and denote @xmath283 by @xmath205 ) @xmath284      we diagonalize the fermion sector in a variational manner . as discussed above , the most general form of the coherent state @xmath285",

    "more precisely @xmath232 is defined to obey @xmath288 on the complementary set of sites , @xmath289 , the reference state is annihilated by @xmath290 .",
    "this means that we choose @xmath221 of the lattice sites to be full of baryons and the rest empty of baryons .",
    "this choice is convenient for our calculation , but the results are insensitive to it : the only thing that matters is that the overall baryon number that @xmath232 contains is @xmath221 ( such that the renormalized baryon number is @xmath5 ) .",

    "they are shown to be subleading in appendix  [ apphf ] .    to obtain a compact form for the classical hamiltonian @xmath307",
    "we define @xmath308 to be the polyakov loop operator that winds @xmath309 times around the torus as @xmath310 and use the identity @xmath311 with @xmath312 regularizing the pole of the left hand side , to re - write the second term of as a sum over terms that only contain powers of @xmath313 . indeed , substituting into the second term of , we find that the terms contributing to the sum over the momentum variable @xmath314 can be isolated and read @xmath315 this allows us to substitute @xmath316 in by @xmath317 .",

    "the expectation values of the latter are determined by the gauge dynamics and feel no back reaction from the fermions .",
    "thus , performing the minimization in section  [ sectorg ] correctly , and determining the properties of the gluonic vacuum in a consistent way , is crucial to get the correct fermion dynamics .",
    "for example , in the sections  [ otherworks ] and  [ decompact ] we emphasize that mistreating the glue sector , which is what one does when one ignores the zero modes , leads , through the way couples the glue sector to the fermion sector , to erroneous results for various fermionic expectation values .",
    "in particular , one can see that if the expectation values of the different polyakov loops are incorrectly chosen to be unity , @xmath322 then by using large-@xmath2 factorization of the double trace term @xmath323 , one finds that the second term in is strongly dependent on @xmath222 ( this is shown explicitly in section  [ symm ] ) .",
    "this volume dependence is contradicting general arguments on large-@xmath2 gauge theories such as those of ref .",

    "we make further important simplifications of that will also allow us to minimize it ( see for example ref .",

    "terms in that sum for which @xmath338 is small are causing this divergence .",

    "the list we give above demonstrates the usefulness of our current paper : firstly , it uses the coherent state approach , which is manifestly gauge invariant throughout .",
    "secondly , it generalize all former studies to the lattice regularization , and extends the study of volume independence to systems with nonzero baryon density and partial translation invariance .",
    "thirdly , it opens the way to study the  t hooft model for arbitrary values of the quark mass , spatial volume , and baryon number . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time these steps are taken .",
    "it is generally expected of large-@xmath2 qcd in @xmath0 dimensions to be independent of its volume .",
    "this equivalence of large-@xmath2 gauge theories with different volumes was first suggested in @xcite and caused great excitement since it was seen to be a potentially easy way to solve large-@xmath2 qcd on the lattice . shortly after @xcite , the papers @xcite showed that this equivalence breaks down in the continuum limit for three or more space - time dimensions .",
    "this breaking of reduction is signaled by the fact that polyakov loops that wrap around the volume acquire nonzero expectation values .",
    "it is useful to put this large-@xmath2 equivalence in the more general context of orbifold projections between mother and daughter gauge theories : in our case the mother theory is large volume qcd while the daughter theory is small volume qcd .",
    "these projections are expected to become equivalences when the rank of the gauge group , @xmath2 , becomes large . for a review on this topic",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "as shown there , these equivalences hold only between certain sectors of the mother and daughter theories which are defined to be neutral under certain symmetries . in the original eguchi - kawai paper",
    "it was stressed explicitly that the ground state in both theories needs to be symmetric under the center of the gauge group . for @xmath26 gauge theories",
    "this means that the global @xmath372 subgroups of the local @xmath26 , that correspond to multiplying polyakov loops in different directions by a @xmath372 phase @xmath373 , must be unbroken .",
    "thus these polyakov loops are the order parameters of these symmetries and must have vanishing expectation values for the equivalence to hold .",
    "another symmetry that the ground states of the mother and daughter theories should respect in the volume projection case is translation symmetry .",
    "this is clear intuitively  how can we describe a theory which breaks translations and that as a result has operators with expectation values that depends on the space - time coordinate , by a theory that has no volume ?",
    "the requirement of intact translation symmetry can of course be anticipated from the construction of ref .",
    "@xcite , since this is one of the symmetries that define that neutral sectors of a large - to - small volume mapping .",
    "indeed this was already explicitly pointed out in the first paper in @xcite .",
    "when this symmetry breaks it is no longer true that the physical observables in the large volume theory have a one - to - one mapping to observables in the zero volume theory .",
    "if the attempt to map the large and small volume theories fails , then clearly they can not be large-@xmath2 equivalent .",
    "unfortunately , we believe that the role of translation symmetry in the eguchi - kawai equivalence is not fully stressed in some of the relevant literature .",
    "the reason , however , is obvious : the qcd vacuum respects translation symmetry !",
    "but there is at least one physical scenario where one can expect to get broken translation symmetry in qcd and that is at nonzero baryon number or chemical potential , where crystals of different sort can form ( for relevant literature on the topic we refer the interested reader to the review in @xcite ) .",
    "what happens to large-@xmath2 volume independence in that case ? to answer this question",
    "we find it useful to see what happens in a well defined and systematic calculation , and the choice of this paper is the  t hooft model .",
    "for any value of the separation @xmath8 , and to measure the meson mass from the exponential decay in @xmath374 .",

    "this can be done by working in the canonical ensemble , or by increasing the chemical potential in the grand canonical ensemble . because the volume is small",
    ", the baryon density will be huge , @xmath441 ( here @xmath442 is the number of spatial dimensions ) , and what we prove in the previous section tells us that at large-@xmath2 this small volume system is equivalent to a ` standard ' large - volume system which is extremely dense . for a lattice theory",
    "the density will be one in units of the cutoff and the following consequence is immediate : trying to study baryons with single - site reduced models of the eguchi - kawai type drives the theory towards the saturation regime of the lattice , where the density is of @xmath443 .",
    "this regime is dominated by lattice artifacts and is unphysical",

    "@xcite , which works with a single site model at nonzero chemical potential @xmath439 , sees either a ground state that is empty of baryons ( for small @xmath439 ) or a ground state that is full of baryons , with density of @xmath443 , and that disappears in the continuum limit . as we discuss above , such behavior is expected from a single - site construction , and can not be used to study the physical regime where the baryon density is not at the cutoff scale .",
    "in this paper we study the way large-@xmath2 qcd depends on its volume .",
    "general arguments , such as those found in ref .",
    "@xcite and in its references , tell us what are the requirements that the ground state of a large-@xmath2 gauge theory needs in order to be volume independent . nonetheless , we find it is useful to see how this phenomenon emerges explicitly in a theory which is exactly soluble .",
    "this is the reason we chose to study the  t hooft model in this paper .",
    "the formalism we use is the lattice hamiltonian formalism in axial gauge .",
    "since we are working with a finite box size , the gauge fields can not be gauged away completely and , in the gluon sector , one is left with a set of @xmath113 curvilinear quantum zero modes .",
    "these describe the @xmath113 eigenvalues of the spatial polyakov loop .",
    "together with their conjugate momenta these zero modes determine the leading @xmath254 dynamics .",

    "@xcite in the hamiltonian to the lattice .",
    "we solve the fermion sector with the coherent state approach of ref .",
    "the reason we choose this approach is that it is manifestly gauge invariant and easy to justify at large-@xmath2 .",
    "we then end up with a regularized form of the  t hooft hamiltonian that explicitly depends on traces of the polyakov loops , and describes their interaction with quark - antiquark pairs in the background of baryons .",
    "our next step was to analyze the volume dependence of the emerging ",
    "t hooft hamiltonian .",
    "we showed that if translation symmetry is intact then    1 .   when the @xmath372 symmetry , whose order parameters are the spatial polyakov loops , is intact , then the spatial coordinate in the  t hooft hamiltonian decompactifies and volume independence emerges .",

    "we see how this condition arises explicitly .",
    "moreover in the case that translation invariance breaks down by a crystal of baryons , we show that a softer form of volume independence takes place and that , at large-@xmath2 , instead of studying a crystal of @xmath5 baryons in a volume @xmath1 , one can study a single baryon in a volume @xmath446 . in both cases",
    "the baryon number density is the same and together with the gauge coupling and the quark mass , these are the only relevant parameters determining the properties of the large-@xmath2 ground state  the volume is irrelevant .    another aspect of large-@xmath2 gauge theories which is explicitly exposed in this work is the dominance of the gauge fields dynamics over the fermions dynamics at large-@xmath2 , and that it also happens at nonzero baryon number .",

    "@xcite does not hold there .",
    "briefly , the way this contradiction gets resolved is by non - perturbative effects , and so using perturbation theory ( even if it is planar ) is quite misleading .",

    "further discussion on this point will be given in ref .",

    "the latter may be useful in our companion study  @xcite where we aim to solve the  t hooft hamiltonian of given a baryon number @xmath449 .",

    "in @xcite we also plan to see what will be the effect of correcting this issue .",
    "finally we hope that knowing how two - dimensional qcd behaves at nonzero baryon number will be of value for studies of the physical four - dimensional system .",
