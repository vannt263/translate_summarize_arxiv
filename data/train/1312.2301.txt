    "our knowledge of the sky at high radio frequency ( @xmath8 ) is poor compared with that at 1.4  ghz because the small field - of - view of ground - based diffraction - limited telescopes makes high - radio - frequency surveys very time - consuming .",
    "however , they are extremely important both to complete some of the gaps in information obtained from lower - frequency surveys as well as to enable different classes of sources to be studied .    in a high - frequency survey",
    ", there is preferential detection of sources with flat spectra up to high frequencies or with peaks in their spectra at high frequencies .",
    "the emission from such sources mainly originates from the compact cores of radio galaxies ( rather than from the extended jets and lobes ) .",
    "it follows that a survey at high frequency probes current and very recent agn activity , whereas a survey at lower frequencies ( e.g. at 1.4  ghz ) probes agn activity on longer timescales ( as well as a large population of star - forming galaxies ) . in combination with a 1.4-ghz survey",
    ", it can therefore provide new insights into the lifetimes and duty cycles of radio - loud agn .",
    "two examples of sources which are preferentially detected at high frequency are : blazars ( the beamed products of fri and frii sources ) , which are prone to variability in flux density , and gigahertz - peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sources .",
    "the latter are compact , powerful radio sources with spectral peaks at ghz frequencies and sizes @xmath9  kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are thought to represent the earliest stages of radio - galaxy evolution and evolve into large - scale radio galaxies , although there are still large gaps in our knowledge of their evolutionary properties .    our knowledge of the sky at 1520  ghz",
    "has much improved over the past 10 years or so thanks to the completion of the australia telescope 20  ghz ( at20 g ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey , the 15.2-ghz ninth cambridge ( 9c ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey and the 15.7-ghz tenth cambridge ( 10c ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey .",
    "correlation of the catalogues from these high - frequency surveys with the 1.4-ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) catalogue suggests strong changes in the 1520-ghz source population with flux density .",
    "the at20 g survey , completed in 2008 , covers the whole southern sky down to a limiting flux density of 40  mjy .",
    "the at20 g source catalogue is dominated by compact , flat - spectrum qsos and bl - lac objects , but the fraction of sources which are unbeamed galaxies begins to rise at fainter flux densities @xcite and this shift is accompanied by a steepening in the median 120-ghz radio spectral index @xcite .",
    "a similar trend was found in the 9c survey which covers a smaller area but probes deeper flux - density levels ( complete to 5.5  mjy ) .",
    "in contrast , in the 10c survey , which covers @xmath10  deg@xmath11 complete to 1.0  mjy and @xmath12  deg@xmath11 complete to 0.5  mjy , a completely different trend was found in which the fraction of steep - spectrum sources _ declined _ with flux density for these fainter sources .",
    "a sub - sample of 10c sources in the lockman hole was studied in detail by @xcite at 610  mhz and 1.4  ghz .",
    "they think it is likely that the faint , flat - spectrum sources are a result of the cores of fri sources becoming dominant at 15.7  ghz .",
    "the advent of the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) makes it possible to carry out a new large - area continuum survey going significantly deeper than the at20 g survey ; the evolutionary map of the universe ( emu ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a wide - field radio continuum survey planned for the new australian square kilometre array pathfinder telescope , would provide deep ( @xmath13 rms ) coverage at 1.4  ghz .",
    "we have carried out a pilot survey , in advance of a larger at20g - deep survey , covering two regions which are well studied at other wavelengths : the chandra deep field south ( 03  hr ; @xmath14  deg ) and part of sdss stripe 82 ( 21  hr ; @xmath15  deg ) .",
    "sources detected in the survey were followed up with atca at 5.5 , 9 and 18  ghz , allowing a detailed study of their radio properties .    in this paper , we present some first results from the at20g - deep pilot survey . we also attempt to provide an interpretation of the spectral index shifts in the 1520-ghz source population described above .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ choice of fields ] describes the survey fields .",
    "section  [ survey observations and data reduction ] outlines our observing strategy , and imaging and source finding techniques . in section",
    "[ correlation with nvss , atlas and first at 1.4 ghz ] , we measure the spectral index distribution of our sample between 1.4 and 20  ghz .",
    "section  [ multi - frequency follow - up observations and data reduction ] describes the reduction of the data from the follow - up observations .",
    "the results from the follow - up observations are presented in sections  [ flux density variability at 20 ghz ] and  [ spectral curvature between 1.4 and 18 ghz ] ; in section  [ flux density variability at 20 ghz ] , we look at variability at 20  ghz over a 3-yr timescale and in section  [ spectral curvature between 1.4 and 18 ghz ] , we investigate spectral curvature between 1.4 and 18  ghz . in section",
    "[ exploring the relationship between spectral index and flux density in the high - radio - frequency source population ] , we combine data from the at20 g , 9c and 10c surveys to explore the relationship between spectral index and flux density .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the sources in the at20g - deep pilot survey will be studied further in an accompanying paper , hereafter paper ii , where we will study their angular sizes and polarisation properties , and look at their optical and infrared characteristics .",
    "two fields form part of the at20g - deep pilot survey : the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) , hereafter referred to as the ` 03hr ' field , and the sdss stripe 82 region , hereafter referred to as the ` 21hr ' field .",
    "each field covers an area of @xmath16 .",
    "the lines of ra and dec . bounding the region complete to 2.5  mjy , for each of the fields , are given in table  [ tab : survey_regions ] ."

    "<S> sources , 10 have clearly defined peaks in their spectra with @xmath4 and @xmath5 . on a 3-yr timescale , at least 10 sources varied by more than 15% at 20  ghz , showing that variability is still common at the low flux densities probed by the at20g - deep pilot survey .    we find a strong and puzzling shift in the typical spectral index of the 1520-ghz source population when combining data from the at20 g , ninth cambridge and tenth cambridge surveys : there is a shift towards a steeper - spectrum population when going from @xmath6  jy to @xmath7  mjy , which is followed by a shift back towards a flatter - spectrum population below @xmath7  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> the 5-ghz source - count model by @xcite , which only includes contributions from fri and frii sources , and star - forming galaxies , does not reproduce the observed flattening of the flat - spectrum counts below @xmath7  mjy . </S>",
