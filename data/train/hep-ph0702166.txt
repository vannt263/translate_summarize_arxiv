    "the @xmath2 mesons provide a unique window into the heavy quark dynamics .",
    "although they are intermediate to the charmonium and bottomonium systems the properties of @xmath2 mesons are a special case in quarkonium spectroscopy as they are the only quarkonia consisting of heavy quarks with different flavours .",
    "because they carry flavour they can not annihilate into gluons so are more stable and excited @xmath2-states lying below @xmath5 ( and @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) threshold can only undergo radiative or hadronic transitions to the ground state @xmath8 which then decays weakly .",
