    "in a recent paper , shen @xcite has extended mashhoon s spin - rotation coupling @xcite to include the coupling of a graviton s spin to a weak gravitomagnetic field and has stressed the role of the self - interaction of the gravitational field itself . ramos and mashhoon @xcite have then studied the effect of the helicity - gravitomagnetic field coupling on weak gravitational waves and shown that a gravitational skrotskii effect @xcite exists .",
    "they further show that the skrotskii rotation angle is twice that expected for electromagnetic waves .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend some of the results of these authors to include any type of weak inertial and gravitational fields and massive as well as massless spin-2 particles and to provide a general framework for the study of spin-@xmath0 particles in external inertial and gravitational fields .",
    "this is accomplished by solving the equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the particle and @xmath3 indicates covariant differentiation .",
    "we use units @xmath4 .    the solution of covariant wave equations for scalar @xcite , spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles @xcite yields in general meaningful insights into aspects of the interaction of quantum systems with gravity whenever the gravitational field need not be quantized .",
    "the interaction of quantum systems with inertial and gravitational fields produces quantum phases .",
    "though these are in general path - dependent , phase differences are observable , in principle , by means of earth bound , or space interferometers , or by gravitational lensing .",
    "the choice of ( [ spin2 ] ) requires some justification .",
    "the propagation equations of higher spin fields contain in general curvature dependent terms that make the formulation of these fields particularly difficult when @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "for spin-@xmath0 fields , the simplest equation of propagation used in lensing is derived in @xcite and is given by @xmath6 the second term in ( [ mtw ] ) is localized in a region surrounding the lens that is small relative to the distances between lens , source and observer and is neglected when the wavelength @xmath7 associated with @xmath8 is smaller than the typical radius of curvature of the gravitational background @xcite . for the metric used in sections iii and iv , we find , in particular , that the curvature term may be neglected when @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the distance from the lens and @xmath11 its schwarzschild radius .",
    "this condition is satisfied in most lensing problems .",
    "it also is adequate to treat the problems discussed in @xcite .    equation ( [ mtw ] ) can be generalized to include a mass term @xmath12 here too the curvature term is smaller than the mass term whenever @xmath13 . for earth",
    "bound experiments @xmath14 and the curvature term becomes negligible for @xmath15 .",
    "in view of the applications discussed below , the curvature term is therefore neglected and ( [ mtw1 ] ) reduces to our initial equation ( [ spin2 ] ) .",
    "the background gravitational field is represented by the metric deviation @xmath16 , and the minkowski metric @xmath17 has signature @xmath18 . to first order in @xmath19 , ( [ spin2 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the linearized ricci tensor of the background metric and @xmath22 is the corresponding christoffel symbol of the first kind .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we give the solution of ( [ spin2 ] ) and illustrate some of its properties in section ii . in section iii",
    "we discuss spin - gravity coupling and geometrical optics .",

    "the solution ( [ solution ] ) applies equally well when @xmath29 is a plane wave or a wave packet solution of ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "no additional approximations are made regarding @xmath31 that obviously satisfies the equation ( [ ff ] ) when @xmath19 vanishes .",

    "the helicity - rotation coupling for massless , or massive spin-@xmath0 particles follows immediately from the @xmath50 term in ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "in fact , the particle energy is changed by virtue of its spin by an amount given by the time integral of this spin term @xmath51 that must then be applied to a solution of ( [ ff ] ) . for rotation about the @xmath52-axis , @xmath53 ,",

    "this proves the frequently quoted statement @xcite that gravitational radiation propagating in a gravitational background is affected by gravitation in the same way that electromagnetic radiation is ( when the photon spin is neglected ) .",
    "the geometrical optics approximation follows immediately from ( [ sol ] ) with @xmath68 .",

    "since only phase differences are physical , it is convenient to choose the space - time path by placing the particle source at a distance very large relative to the dimensions of @xmath87 , while the generic point is located at @xmath88 along the @xmath71 direction and @xmath89 .",

    "the framework developed can also be used in the interferometry of atoms and molecules . a laboratory instrument capable of using coherent beams of atoms or molecules",
    "would go a long way in probing the interface between gravitational theories and quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , the phase shift of a particle beam in the lense - thirring field of the earth is @xcite @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the angular momentum of earth ( assumed spherical and homogeneous ) , @xmath174 its radius and @xmath175 the typical dimension of the interferometer . for neutron interferometers with @xmath176",
