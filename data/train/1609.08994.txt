    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has ruled the collider scene for decades .",
    "varied and very detailed tests of the sm have confirmed its validity at the available energies .",
    "searches for new physics phenomena beyond the sm in dilepton ( electron or muon ) final states provide clean signatures and have been a mainstay of the quest strategy .",
    "resonant or non - resonant effects have been searched for extensively at hadron colliders like the lhc , see e.g  @xcite , and in the cleaner environment of lepton colliders at lower energies , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the backgrounds for new high mass resonant ( like z ) or non - resonant ( like contact interactions or extra dimensions ) effects are dominated by the drell - yan ( dy ) process of opposite sign lepton pair production , mediated through photon or z exchange from the initial partons in the incoming protons . with the rapidly increasing accumulated luminosity at the lhc precise estimations of the background",
    "are a key ingredient of the dilepton searches , especially of the non - resonant variety . to reach the required precision , calculations at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) are needed .",
    "nnlo cross section calculations reduce the dependence of the results on the renormalization and factorization scale choices to the couple of percent level , as expected when enough orders are included in the calculation .",
    "the qcd calculations depend on the parton density functions ( pdf ) of the protons .",
    "the following modern pdfs  @xcite are used in this study .",
    "the pdf uncertainties are estimated using the latest pdf4lhc  @xcite prescriptions . in most cases",
    "the ct14 pdf set , the pdf4lhc15 set ( which is an average of the ct14 , mmht14 and nnpdf3.0 pdf sets ) or the luxqed_plus_pdf4lhc15 set are used .",
    "additional pdf sets are utilized for special purposes .",
    "the reweighting technique  @xcite for pdf uncertainties is used .    beside the qcd effects ,",
    "electroweak ( ewk ) effects become very important at lhc energies . technically ( and as implemented in various calculation or simulation tools ) , they fall in two classes :    1 .   quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) only effects : final state radiation ( fsr ) , initial state radiation ( isr ) and their interference 2 .   pure weak corrections : vertex , ww and zz box , and self - energy contributions .",
    "in addition to the dy process , lepton pairs can be produced in gamma - gamma collisions , where photons radiated by the incoming protons collide .",
    "to calculate this process , usually labeled photon - initiated ( pi ) background in various searches , we need parton density functions including the photon component .",
    "quantum electrodynamics introduces corrections to the parton evolution : photon parton distributions @xmath1 are present for the proton ( neutron ) , and part of the proton ( or neutron ) momentum is carried by the photons .",
    "the pdf depends on the parton momentum fraction - bjorken @xmath2 , and the momentum transfer @xmath3 . in this study",
    "the modern photon pdfs  @xcite are used . in drell - yan ,",
    "w and z production at the lhc the photon contribution is suppressed by a factor @xmath4 compared to the canonical quark - antiquark contribution .    for an up - to - date paper on the issues involved in precision studies of the dy process , see e.g.  @xcite , which concentrates on w and z boson production . in contrast , the focus of this paper is on the high mass search region up to the lhc kinematic limit - a not so well explored area of phase space .",
    "the calculations for the drell - yan process and the photon - induced background are carried out with the program . the @xmath5 scheme with the w mass , the z mass and the fermi constant @xmath5 ( measured in muon decay ) as input parameters besides the fermion masses is used .",
    "the strong coupling is set to @xmath6 .",
    "the pdfs considered in this study are ct14 , nnpdf30 , pdf4lhc15 and luxqed_plus_pdf4lhc15 , as provided by the lhapdf libraries version 5 or 6  @xcite .",
    "full electroweak corrections at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) are computed ( the flag ew control = 0 is used ) .",
    "qcd effects are computed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . when the pi background is added to the drell - yan cross section we label the results .",
    "calculations for dielectrons or dimuons in the acceptance of a generic general purpose lhc experiment are presented : both outgoing leptons are required to have pseudorapidity @xmath7 .",
    "relatively hard cuts suitable for searches at high invariant masses extending to the multi-@xmath8 region are used - the transverse momenta for both leptons have to satisfy @xmath9 .    an important difference between the two channels",
    "is the treatment of photons located close in space to the leptons .",
    "they can originate from final state radiation , or from unrelated sources , e.g. the copious decays of @xmath10 in a hadron collider environment .",
    "the variable @xmath11 is used to measure `` closeness '' : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pseudorapidities and azimuthal angles of the lepton and the photon .    in the case of electrons",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeters of the experiments provide a natural `` integration '' of the energies of close - by photons with the electron energies . as a result",
    "the invariant mass reconstructed from the electron energies is closer to the electron pair mass before fsr . in the case of muons where the transverse momenta can be measured both in the central trackers , and in the outer muon detectors",
    "after the photons are absorbed , there is no such effect .",
    "two lepton definitions as available in fewz are used in the calculations :    1 .",
    "`` dressed '' electrons : photons within @xmath15 , and with @xmath16 and transverse momentum @xmath17 are included in the electron energies 2 .",
    "`` bare '' muons : photon energy is not included .",
    "the ct14qed set is introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the initial photon distribution is defined by the initial photon momentum fraction @xmath18 at scale @xmath191.295  @xmath20 .    from the zeus data on deep inelastic scattering with isolated photons  @xcite the photon pdf is constrained to @xmath21 .",
    "the constraint can be improved in measurements where the photon contribution is enhanced by selecting exclusive dimuon pair production in elastic , single dissociative and double dissociative pp collisions  @xcite .",
    "these cms measurements are used in  @xcite to update the ct14qed analysis : @xmath22 consistent with the zeus data analysis .",
    "recent developments determine the photon pdfs to even higher precision .",
    "the importance of taking into account both the coherent ( photon emission from the proton as a whole ) and non - coherent components in the initial photon distribution is highlighted in  @xcite , and a well determined photon pdf is obtained for high mass lepton pair production . a model - independent approach  @xcite looks in great detail at the photon distribution , and constrains it quite well with electron - proton scattering data .",
    "the result is the luxqed_plus_pdf4lhc15 photon pdf set .",
    "in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] the cross section ratios at nlo in qcd and electroweak corrections are shown .",
    "we compare three sets of calculations :    1 .",
    "qcd at nlo , no ewk corrections 2 .",
    "qcd at nlo and qed corrections : fsr , isr and their interference ; weak corrections off 3 .",
    "qcd at nlo and full ewk corrections .",
    "as can be seen the pure qed corrections are bigger in the dimuon channel due to the use of `` bare '' muons .",
    "the full ewk corrections are very important at high invariant masses : they reduce the cross section by more than 20% in the dielectron channel and by up to 30 % in the dimuon channel . in some monte - carlo simulations only qed effects",
    "are taken into account . clearly",
    "the inclusion of full ewk effects is key for successful comparisons to data .",
    "the importance of complete ewk corrections for lhc at 14 @xmath8 was recognized early  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here agree well with calculations in this exploratory study .",
    "higher order corrections of mixed qcd - ewk type @xmath23 are ignored in fewz .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] the pdf uncertainties for the nlo cross sections ( qcd and full ewk ) , using the ct14nlo pdf , are shown as a function of mass .",
    "they become sizable above 2  @xmath8 and approach @xmath24  40% for masses above 5  @xmath0 . as discussed later , the pdf uncertainties are dominant at high mass .    the dependence of the cross sections on the choice of pdf is displayed in figure  [ fig : fig2a]a for the ct14nlo and pdf4lhc_nlo_100 sets . for masses below 5  @xmath8 the variation is below 5% , reaching @xmath25  15% for the highest masses .",
    "the variation from one is covered by the pdf uncertainties , and could become important only for very high integrated luminosities - as shown in the next section even for 100 fb@xmath26 no events from sm sources are expected above 5  @xmath8 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2a]b the dependence of the cross sections on variations in the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath27 is examined . for variations larger",
    "then the current error from the world average  @xcite : @xmath28 the effects are below 1% for the whole mass range under study .",
    "the effect of photon - initiated lepton pair production on the cross sections is shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , where the ratios ( dy+pi)/dy are displayed .",
    "the ct14qed_proton pdf is used .",
    "it includes the photon contribution .",
    "the initial photon momentum fraction @xmath29 , which is a free parameter , is varied between 0.00% and 0.09% as discussed earlier , and the two limiting cases are displayed .",
    "their difference is used as one standard deviation in the first event rates estimate .",
    "the recent photon pdfs , publicly available as of this writing , are compared in figure  [ fig : fig3a ] for the dimuon channel .",
    "the ct14qed_inc_proton pdf is based on ct14nlo with the initial photon pdf defined by the sum of the inelastic photon pdf and the elastic photon pdf , obtained from the equivalent photon approximation .",
    "the inclusion of the elastic component enhances the pi contribution .",
    "the results from the luxqed_plus_pdf4lhc15 set show the highest pi effects  .",
    "this set is used for the second estimate of event rates .",
    "it benefits also from smaller pdf uncertainties at nnlo , see figure  [ fig : fig3a ] .",
    "the photon - initiated effects are generally small , not above the 5% level for masses of up to @xmath25  2  @xmath8 , and can reach @xmath25  1520% above 5  @xmath8 if the photon momentum fraction is taken to be 0.09% or if the luxqed_plus_pdf4lhc15 set is used . the one @xmath30 band defined above for ct14qed_proton pdf",
    "is also shown in figure  [ fig : fig3a ] .",
    "the predictions from the ct14qed_inc_proton pdf are inside this band for masses above 1.5  @xmath8 , while for the luxqed_plus_pdf4lhc15 set they fall inside the band only for the highest masses .",
    "the newest photon pdfs predict somewhat stronger pi effects in the lower half of the mass range under study .    the results presented here agree well with the results from  @xcite based on the pioneering mrst2004qed  @xcite pdf set .",
    "the predictions from the freely parametrized nnpdf photon pdf  @xcite , also analyzed in  @xcite , and the newer version  @xcite , have large pdf uncertainties in the most interesting search region .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] the cross section ratios for calculations at nnlo or nlo in qcd , the so called k functions , are shown for dielectrons and dimuons . in all cases full ewk corrections",
    "are included .",
    "the k functions are below 1.04 for the whole mass range under study , so the nnlo qcd effects are quite small .",
    "the k functions exhibit a complex behavior as a function of mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] compares the pdf uncertainties for nlo and nnlo cross sections ( qcd and full ewk ) , using the order - matched ct14nlo and ct14nnlo pdfs .",
    "the good news is that the uncertainties are reduced at nnlo .",
    "if enough orders are included in the perturbative expansion , the results should not depend on the choice of renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "traditionally this effect is estimated by varying the scales by a factor of two around the nominal scale , which for drell - yan is taken to be the mass of the outgoing dilepton system .",
    "an example of such variation for nnlo calculations is shown in figure  [ fig : fig5a ] .",
    "the cross sections change by less than 3% below masses of 5  @xmath8 . for the highest masses the variation reaches 3.6% . at nnlo in qcd",

    "are combined .",

    "the ct14 pdfs are used for the first set of results .",
    "the uncertainty of the photon - induced background , as defined in the previous section , can be seen on the plots .",

    "the expected numbers of events are summarized in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the yield is slightly higher in the dielectron channel due to the recovery of fsr radiation by the electromagnetic calorimeters . as a result",

    "all things being equal the dielectron channel might be first in a discovery .",
    "additional search options are provided by measuring the forward - backward asymmetry . here",
    "the muon channel may have an advantage , as the charge determination for electrons relies on the central trackers with much shorter lever arm , so it becomes increasingly difficult at high energies .",
    "around one event with mass exceeding 3 @xmath8 per channel is expected for luminosity of 100 fb@xmath26 .",
