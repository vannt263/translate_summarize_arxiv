    "it is remarkable that one hundred years after the general theory of relativity was first formulated that there are still no known exact analytical solutions to einstein s equations describing an isolated rotating body .",
    "there are of course highly accurate numerical solutions of rotating stars  @xcite , but mathematically it is of interest to obtain analytic solutions . in particular , and of main interest in this paper , there are no exact solutions describing an interior rotating charged perfect fluid which can be matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior .",
    "one reason for this is the sparsity of known analytic charged rotating fluid interiors .",
    "one such interior is the garca solution  @xcite , also known as the wahlquist - newman metric  @xcite , which is the charged generalisation of the rotating wahlquist solution  @xcite .",
    "the wahlquist solution is in turn the rotating generalisation of the static whittaker metric .",
    "these metrics all have unphysical equations of state , in the wahlquist and whittaker case the simple relation @xmath0 holds , where @xmath1 is the energy density and @xmath2 is the pressure . nonetheless due to the lack of explicit solutions the possibility of matching these solutions to external vacuum domains should be investigated .    the slow rotation formalism developed by hartle in 1967",
    "@xcite has been important in deriving results about the possibility of matching these interior solutions to exterior vacuum regions .",
    "if the matching is not possible to a particular exterior in the slow rotation limit , then it will not be possible for a more rapid rotation .",
    "this argument has been used to show that the wahlquist metric can not be matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum  @xcite , and one proves this by expanding the wahlquist metric to second order in the fluid s angular velocity .",
    "if one drops the requirement that the vacuum is asymptotically flat , the matching becomes possible  @xcite , however this means the wahlquist metric can not serve as a model for an isolated body , as a far away quadrupole mass distribution is required to keep the body in equilibrium .",
    "the matching conditions become more restrictive once charge is included . in the absence of charge , if one linearises the einstein equations in the angular velocity of the metric , one can show that the general slowly rotating exterior vacuum solution of a perfect fluid sphere coincides with the kerr solution , and one can match any slow rotating perfect fluid interior to this .",
    "however in the presence of charge , the general exterior vacuum solution to the linearised einstein maxwell equations does not in general coincide with the kerr - newman solution , and in fact is in general not asymptotically flat  @xcite .",
    "thus if one requires asymptotic flatness , as necessary for describing an isolated rotating body in a flat background , then the matching conditions become overdetermined in general . in the particular case of the garca metric",
    ", it was shown in  @xcite that to first order in angular velocity this metric can not be matched to an asymptotically flat exterior metric .",
    "it is found the fluid needs to be embedded in an external magnetic field , parallel to the axes of rotation , and thus the authors conclude that the garca metric can not be suitable for describing an isolated charged body .",
    "it is now consensus that the universe is accelerating in expansion , which can be well explained by the presence of a small non - zero positive cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "thus the universe is not asymptotically flat , rather asymptotically it behaves like de sitter space .",
    "this observation has resurrected interest in studying such spacetimes , which are either asymptotically de sitter or anti - de sitter .",
    "of course , the small observed value of the cosmological constant means that its effects on astrophysical objects are negligible",
    ". however the presence of even a tiny cosmological constant completely changes the asymptotic structure of spacetime  @xcite .",
    "moreover a given perfect fluid solution to einstein s equation in the absence of a cosmological constant is also a solution to einstein s equation with cosmological constant , achieved by making the substitution @xmath3 for the pressure @xmath2 , and @xmath4 for the energy density .",
    "this of course changes the equation of state of the fluid , but for the wahlquist metric , the equation of state retains the same form , @xmath0 . therefore the possibility of matching rotating fluids to asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter spaces should be investigated .",
    "recently this approach was considered in  @xcite , where it was shown that to second order in the angular velocity the wahlquist metric can be matched to an asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter external vacuum .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate this possibility for the garca metric in the slow rotation limit .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin in section 2 by reviewing the garca solution and its form in the slow rotation limit . in section 3",
    "we examine the general slow rotating electro - lambda - vacuum exterior metric , which we show is always asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter , with the electromagnetic field tensor likewise asymptotically decaying . finally in section 4 we describe the matching procedure and we show that up to first order in the angular velocity one can in fact match the garca metric to an asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter vacuum . thus we conclude by noting that the garca metric may be suitable for describing an isolated rotating charged body in ( anti)-de sitter spaces .",
    "in this section we briefly review the garca solution and dicuss its form in the slow rotation limit .",
    "the garca solution , first discovered in 1991  @xcite , is the charged generalisation of the wahlquist metric  @xcite and is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6\\sinh(2kx)\\nonumber+[b-(g+\\beta x)^2]\\cosh(2kx ) , \\nonumber\\\\ q&= a-\\frac{1}{2k}[2m+y(\\alpha+\\beta^2)]\\sin(2ky)\\nonumber+[b+(e+\\beta y)^2]\\cos(2ky).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above @xmath7 and @xmath8 are eleven constants . up to diffeomorphism invariance only eight of these are independent parameters  @xcite .",
    "this metric is a solution to the einstein - maxwell equations with a cosmological constant @xmath9}=0 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the electromagnetic field tensor which can be written in terms of the four potential @xmath11 as @xmath12 @xmath13 is the stress energy tensor of the electromagnetic field @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the stress energy tensor of a standard perfect fluid with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the four velocity .    the pressure @xmath2 and density @xmath1 of this particular solution are given in terms of the metric components by @xmath18 where the quantity @xmath19 has been defined as @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the four potential @xmath21 is given by @xmath22.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "now we examine its form in the slow rotation limit .",
    "one can write the general metric of a slowly rotating perfect fluid sphere in the following form  @xcite @xmath23 \\label{slow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where an expansion in the angular velocity @xmath24 of the fluid is made . in this paper",
    "we consider only the first order perturbations in @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the metric functions @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are simply the static non - rotating solutions , to first order in @xmath24 they remain unmodified .",
    "rotation is added through the function @xmath28 which is assumed to be of @xmath29 ( and thus we follow others and slightly abuse notation by neglecting the @xmath30 component of the above metric ) . in",
    "@xcite coordinate transformations of the garca metric were derived which allowed it to be put into the above slowly rotating form .",
    "it was found that @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath32 and @xmath28 are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 is of order @xmath24 and is taken as the slow rotation parameter . in the static limit @xmath35",
    "this metric reduces to the charged whittaker metric .",
    "the density and pressure are now given by @xmath36 we must also expand the four potential @xmath21 up to first order in @xmath34 , and it is found that @xmath37d\\varphi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath38 is the magnetic monopole charge parameter .",
    "the metric is completely independent of this parameter , and it only contributes to the maxwell equations .    the set of constants in the original metric have now been transformed to a new set of five constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the number of constants has been reduced from the original eight independent parameters ( modulo diffeomorphisms ) by fixing a coordinate system and ensuring that the metric is completely regular at the center .",
    "now in this section we will find the corresponding slow rotating form of the vacuum exterior .",
    "we make a slow rotation approximation around reissner - nordstrm - de sitter space by expanding the metric up to first order in the angular velocity @xmath24 .",
    "we write the metric in the same form as the slow rotating garca metric  ( [ slow ] ) . now from the einstein equations , to first order in the angular velocity ,",
    "the diagonal components of the metric are unmodified and the only modification is to the @xmath41 component , see  @xcite .",
    "hence we may write the electrovacuum exterior as @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the mass , @xmath44 is the charge and @xmath45 is the cosmological constant , which we consider either to be positive or negative .",
    "the function @xmath28 is first order in the angular velocity , and again we ignore the @xmath30 component of the above metric . in the garca interior solution ,",
    "the function @xmath28 is dependent on @xmath46 only , and we will make the additional assumption that this to be true in the exterior metric also .",
    "we can choose a gauge such that the four potential of the electromagnetic field @xmath47 , to zero - th order in angular velocity , is @xmath48 from the einstein equations we will see that the only component of the four potential that is perturbed to first order in @xmath24 is @xmath49 .",
    "let us first examine the slow rotating form of the kerr - newman - de sitter metric .",
    "the full metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 and the electromagnetic potential of this metric is given by @xmath53    to write this in the slow rotating form  ( [ slow ] ) , we simply expand this metric up to first order in the parameter @xmath54 , which we take to be the rotation parameter and is of order @xmath24 .",
    "it is readily seen that the functions @xmath55 and @xmath28 are given by @xmath56 @xmath57 we are free to perform a rigid rotation of our coordinate system , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a suitably chosen constant to remove the contribution @xmath60 from this expression .",
    "this is done so that we are working in an asymptotically non - rotating frame .",
    "let us now return to working with a general exterior .",
    "for a general @xmath45-electrovacuum , the @xmath61 components of einstein s equation gives us the following differential equation @xmath62 we can solve this equation to find the general solution of @xmath55 for a non - zero charge @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an arbitrary function of @xmath65 .",
    "we now insert this solution back into the maxwell equation @xmath66 and we find the following differential equation relating @xmath28 to @xmath64 @xmath67 this is a separable equation , with the left - hand side independent of @xmath65 , and hence we may write @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant",
    ". we can write the left - hand side of this equation simply as @xmath70 so that this equation  ( [ feqn ] ) has the simple general solution @xmath71    now examining the radial part of the equation  ( [ ome1eqn ] ) gives us a third order inhomogeneous differential equation for @xmath28 @xmath72 the presence of @xmath45 in this equation makes finding an analytic solution difficult",
    ". however we can find a particular solution , and noting that a constant is also clearly a solution allows us to write the following ansatz for @xmath28 @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are all first order constants in @xmath24 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are two linearly independent solutions of  ( [ omegaequation ] ) .",
    "we will analyse the form of these solutions shortly .",
    "now since we know that the slow rotating kerr - newman - de sitter is a particular solution to the above equation , we see that we can set @xmath79 , so that taking @xmath80 , @xmath81 we have simply the slow rotating kerr - newmann - de sitter metric . and",
    "again , we are always free to set @xmath74 to zero by adjusting to an asymptotically non rotating frame via a rigid rotation of our coordinate system .    substituting this solution back into the potential we obtain @xmath82",
    "the term @xmath83 simply gives rise to a magnetic monopole .",
    "now the form of the solutions @xmath77 and  @xmath78 of  ( [ omegaequation ] ) are completely different depending on whether @xmath84 .",
    "we investigate the two distinct cases below .",
    "the solution for @xmath84 was derived in  @xcite , and we review its properties here . assuming @xmath85 , it was found @xmath86}{m^2(e^2-m^2)^2r^4}+\\frac{2e^2(e^2 - 2mr)}{3m^3 r^4(e^2-m^2 ) } \\\\ \\omega_2&=\\frac{2}{r}+\\frac{e^2(e^2 - 2 m r)}{mr^4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is implicitly defined through @xmath88 and can be written in terms of @xmath89 or @xmath90 depending on whether the discriminant of the metric component @xmath91 , which is given by @xmath92 , is positive or negative respectively .",
    "asymptotically expanding these functions in powers of @xmath93 we find the following far field behaviour @xmath94    now we can find the asymptotic behaviour of the metric and electromagnetic field tensor by using the following tetrad @xmath95 expressed in this tetrad , it can be shown the electromagnetic field does not vanish asymptotically unless the constant @xmath76 vanishes , since @xmath96 and similarly by expanding the weyl curvature tensor in this tetrad , it is also found that the metric is not asymptotically flat unless @xmath81 .",
    "thus the general vacuum exterior rotating charged metric can not describe an isolated object .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that if one attempts to match the garca metric to this exterior vacuum , the matching conditions dictate that this constant @xmath97 , and so the exterior vacuum will not be asymptotically flat .",
    "therefore the garca metric can not describe an isolated rotating body in an asymptotically flat spacetime .      when @xmath98 we are unable to find the exact analytic solutions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 from equation  ( [ omegaequation ] ) .",
    "however we are able to find the form of the solutions asymptotically by making an expansion in powers of @xmath93 @xmath99 and we note the function @xmath77 now falls off like @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath78 now falls of like @xmath101 .    to confirm these results",
    ", we can also integrate  ( [ omegaequation ] ) numerically .",
    "we set @xmath102 in the equation so we ignore the particular solution corresponding to the kerr - newman - de sitter contribution and find simply the form of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 contribution .",
    "we also numerically integrate the solution for @xmath103 , since we are only interested in how the solution decays for large @xmath46 , and this will allow us to ignore the constant contribution which arises when numerically integrating @xmath28 .    a plot of @xmath103 against @xmath46 is plotted on a logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "( [ fig : num1 ] ) for a negative cosmological constant .",
    "a positive cosmological constant leads to numerical difficulties at the cosmological horizon , meaning different coordinates would need to be used , however numerically integrating the equation above the horizon gives very much the same result . on logarithmic graphs ,",
    "the functions @xmath104 are straight lines with gradient @xmath105 , so analysing the gradient of the line on the logarithmic scale allows us to measure the power at which @xmath46 decays .",
    "we find for all three graphs @xmath106 , which supports our asymptotic result that @xmath107 decays like @xmath108 for large @xmath46 .     against @xmath46 on a logarithmic scale on both axes .",
    "the parameter values are @xmath109 and @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this means the black hole horizon is located at @xmath112 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    now we must investigate whether this observed asymptotic behaviour means that the metric is asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter , and we must also investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "this time we use the tetrad @xmath115 in this tetrad , we obtain the following behaviour of the electromagnetic field asymptotically @xmath116 and in fact these components decay like @xmath117 , exactly the same as kerr - newman - de sitter space .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the @xmath84 case .",
    "it is also readily seen that this exterior metric is always asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter .",
    "we can see this by examining the asymptotic behaviour of the weyl tensor .",
    "we use the standard definition for the gravitoelectric fields @xmath118 and the gravitomagnetic fields @xmath119 @xmath120 with the remaining four components of the weyl tensor vanishing identically . using the asymptotic expansion for @xmath28 , we find the following expansions for large  @xmath46 @xmath121 for the gravitomagnetic fields @xmath119 it is found @xmath122 which decays appropriately quickly to be asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter",
    ". the remaining requirements of being asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter are easily checked and can be done in a similar way to the examples in  @xcite . in the case of de sitter space",
    "it is of course important to be careful with coordinates above the cosmological horizon , and this can be dealt with in a rigorous way , again see  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to observe that the extra contributions to @xmath28 decay as quickly as kerr - newman - de sitter space , which is asymptotically de sitter .",
    "thus the general vacuum exterior is asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter , and hence the possibility of matching the slow rotating garca metric to this exterior vacuum should be investigated , considering we now have one extra constant available to perform the matching with .",
    "we investigate this in the next section .",
    "in this section we describe the matching procedure and prove the following result :    _ the linearised garca metric can be matched to an asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter vacuum exterior .",
    "_    now we have already written both the interior and exterior metrics in the form @xmath123.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows we will denote the vacuum region and the interior region by superscripts @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively .",
    "we first apply the following coordinate transformations to the interior fluid region @xmath126 in order to perform the matching .",
    "the matching conditions up to first order in the angular velocity of the fluid were derived in  @xcite . up to this order the matching surface , or the zero pressure surface ,",
    "remains a sphere , which we take to be at radius @xmath127 .",
    "deviations from the spherical symmetry of this surface do nt appear until one considers second order corrections to the metric . in order to have a global model in which surface layers of matter are absent ,",
    "the following darmois - israel  @xcite conditions on the metric are required @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the extrinsic curvature of the metric .",
    "these conditions imply the metric functions @xmath25 and @xmath28 are @xmath130 continuous and @xmath26 is @xmath131 continuous at the zero pressure surface @xmath127 . to ensure absence of surface charges and currents the components @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 of the electromagnetic field tensor are required to be @xmath131 on this surface .",
    "the zero - th order matching conditions allow us to find the constants @xmath135 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the radius @xmath136 of the zero pressure surface in terms of the parameters @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 of the internal static fluid .",
    "matching of the @xmath140 component gives @xmath141 using continuity of @xmath142 and @xmath91 we obtain @xmath143 and continuity of @xmath144 gives @xmath145 the equation of the zero pressure surface , which can equivalently be derived from the junction condition for @xmath91 and @xmath146 , lets us solve for the constant @xmath147 @xmath148 and finally the mass of the fluid is derived from the continuity of @xmath91 @xmath149      now if we consider the first order matching conditions , we are able to find the values of the first order constants @xmath54 , @xmath24 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath83 in terms of the parameters of the interior fluid .",
    "continuity of the @xmath41 component of the metric gives the angular velocity of the fluid @xmath150 while continuity of @xmath151 allows us to find the kerr parameter @xmath54 @xmath152 equating magnetic monopole terms gives , as in the @xmath84 case , we find simply @xmath153 finally the continuity of @xmath154 and @xmath155 allow us to solve for both @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath156 @xmath157 where the quantity @xmath158 is defined as @xmath159 we can then insert the solution for @xmath54  ( [ asolution ] ) into  ( [ c1 ] ) and  ( [ c2 ] ) , which will then give two linear simultaneous equations for @xmath75 and @xmath76 which can then easily be solved , although the expressions are lengthy so we omit the details here .",
    "this means that all the matching conditions are now satisfied , and therefore our main result is shown to be true .",
    "we have shown that the garca metric can be matched to an exterior @xmath45-vacuum solution up to first order in the fluids angular velocity .",
    "this exterior solution is asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter .",
    "this contrasts with the @xmath84 case , where it is the case that the exterior of the slow rotating garca metric is not asymptotically flat in general .",
    "the addition of a cosmological constant essentially gives rise to an additional degree of freedom by allowing one extra constant in the exterior , meaning there are now enough parameters to match to all of the interior parameters .",
    "this allows us to interpret the slow rotating garca solution as an isolated body in a cosmological background , an interpretation not possible in the absence of the cosmological term .",
    "this is a very similar result to the one recently obtained in  @xcite for the wahlquist metric , where to second order in angular velocity the matching to an asymptotically empty domain was found only to be possible once @xmath45 was introduced .",
    "the addition of charge does not drastically change this result , however the requirement of needing a cosmological constant to perform the matching now appears at first order in the angular velocity rather than second order .",
    "in fact with this extra degree of freedom , it can easily be shown , using the same procedure outlined above , that any slow rotating charged perfect fluid interior can be matched to an asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter metric up to first order in angular velocity .",
