    "this allowed us to define the cross section for particle capture into these long - lived states in the spirit of the optical model @xcite , by averaging over a small energy interval containing many resonances .",
    "note that this capture emerges in a purely potential scattering problem , without any absorption introduced _ a priori_. somewhat unexpectedly , the capture cross section turned out to be equal to the cross section obtained by assuming total absorption at the event horizon .    in particular , in the zero - energy limit our result coincides with unruh s absorption cross section @xmath10 for a black hole @xcite .",
    "this shows that a non - singular static metric can acquire black - hole properties prior to the actual formation of the black hole .",
    "it is interesting to see whether this resonance absorption phenomenon is specific to near - black - hole metrics , or if there are other instances of similar behaviour .",
    "for example , consider a massive star modelled as an incompressible fluid sphere .",
    "the interior of such a body is described by the schwarzschild interior metric @xcite .",
    "this metric develops a pressure singularity at the origin for @xmath3 , far form the black - hole limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite we examined the spectrum of discrete bound states for a massive scalar particle in the gravitational field described by this metric .",
    "it was found that near the singularity this spectrum acquires some black - hole - like features . in particular , all the levels with finite principal quantum number @xmath11 collapse towards zero energy ( binding energy is @xmath12 ) , i.e. , the spectral density becomes infinite , similar to that of a near - black - hole metric ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this gives us a motivation to search for narrow resonances in the schwarzschild interior metric .",
    "indeed , in the present work we find such resonances in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "however , in contrast to the black - hole - like case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective potential produced by the schwarzschild interior metric possesses a barrier near the boundary , and the long resonance lifetimes are due to the particle having to tunnel through this barrier to the surface of the body .",
    "similar to the black - hole - like behaviour for @xmath13 , the resonance width @xmath6 and energy spacing @xmath5 tend to zero for the schwarzschild interior metric in the limit @xmath3 , while their ratio @xmath14 remains finite and tends to zero at small energies @xmath8 .",
    "one can thus define the `` optical '' capture cross section by averaging over a small energy interval containing many resonances .",
    "in contrast to the near - black - hole case , where the cross section remains finite , the absorption cross section for the schwarzschild interior metric tends to zero at zero energy .",
    "however , this metric still possesses black - hole - like absorption for nonzero energies .",
    "this means that such an object may gravitationally absorb particles in a black - hole - like manner despite the fact that its metric never approaches that of a black hole .    in what follows",
    "we analyse the massless scalar particle scattering problem for the schwarzschild interior metric both numerically and analytically .",
