    "@xmath6 orionis is the brightest member of a young ( @xmath7myr ) stellar cluster of the same name , located in the orion ob1b association at a distance modulus of @xmath8-@xmath9 ( bjar et al .",
    "assuming that all members of this cluster are coeval , it represents an ideal hunting ground for very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , since such objects are at their most luminous when young .",
    "when combined with the fact that the cluster is unlikely to have undergone any dynamical evolution , such as evaporation or mass segregation , @xmath6 orionis seems like an ideal candidate for studying the initial mass function .",
    "the mass function can be determined from photometry but it is possible that contaminating objects , such as foreground m - dwarfs , bias the result .",
    "one way of eliminating these polluting objects from the colour magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is to perform a spectroscopic survey of cluster candidates .",
    "since the cluster is very young all low - mass members should retain their initial lithium .",
    "the int wide - field camera was used to obtain @xmath10 and @xmath4 band photometry of a one square degree area of the @xmath6 orionis cluster during october 1999 .",
    "complete to @xmath11 and centered on the star after which the cluster is named , the photometry was used to select @xmath12 cluster candidates for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "unfortunately , eleven of these targets were `` lost '' from the dataset because they fell down fibres of poor transmission ( see below ) .",
    "the targets covered an @xmath4 magnitude range of @xmath13-@xmath14 , the fainter end of this scale corresponding to an object with an age - dependent mass of @xmath15-@xmath16 ( at @xmath17-@xmath18myr ) , i.e. , just into the realm of brown dwarfs ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "figure @xmath17 shows the spectroscopic targets as triangles on an ( @xmath4 , ) colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "spectroscopic targets are shown as triangles - filled ones indicating cluster membership , open indicating no evidence of lithium .",
    "baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) isochrones are also shown.,width=264 ]    during december 1999 we obtained follow - up high - resolution ( @xmath17  fwhm ) optical spectroscopy for the photometric members using the wide field fibre optic spectrograph ( wyffos ) on the @xmath20 m william herschel telescope .",
    "the large - fibre module was used ( @xmath21diameter fibres ) with spectra being recorded via the tek 6 1024 pixel ccd . the @xmath22  echelle filter",
    "was selected , giving a spectral coverage of approximately @xmath23-@xmath24 , with a nominal dispersion of @xmath25  pixel@xmath26 .",
    "spectra were taken over two nights and of the @xmath27 targets observed , @xmath28 were common to both of these runs .",
    "total exposure times were ; @xmath29 hours per target on the night of december @xmath30 , and @xmath31 hours on december @xmath32 .",
    "arc spectra were obtained using a tungsten lamp and sky exposures were taken following each target frame .",
    "reduction was carried out predominantly within the iraf environment , using the wyfred procedure .",
    "all images were initially bias subtracted by interpolating the overscan region across the whole of the frame .",
    "flats were then used to remove the instrumental signature of the ccds .",
    "wyfred employed an optimal method to extract the spectra from a frame , each spectrum was dispersion corrected and wavelength calibrated using a function determined from the arc spectra . finally , a fibre - to - fibre throughput correction was applied using offset - sky frames , and sky subtraction performed with mean sky spectra obtained with dedicated sky fibres .",
    "spectra from the same night were co - added to increase the signal to noise ratio , but the decision was made not to combine spectra from the two nights as this could mask any short period binaries .",
    "the `` lithium test '' exploits the fact that objects with masses @xmath33 never attain the high internal temperatures ( @xmath34k ) required to burn lithium as a nuclear fuel .",
    "stars above this mass - limit will consume the element , the age at which lithium destruction begins is determined by the mass of the star - the lower the mass , the longer until the onset of burning . the current work investigates the cluster surrounding @xmath6 orionis , members of which are believed to have ages of @xmath35myr . at this age ,",
    "stars in the approximate mass range @xmath25-@xmath36 will have consumed most of their initial lithium .",
    "all of our spectroscopic targets are believed to be less massive than @xmath37 , hence if the true cluster age is @xmath38myr , and there is little or no age spread , one would expect all the genuine cluster members to contain lithium .",
    "each spectrum was visually inspected for the characteristic @xmath39 lithium i doublet , and equivalent widths calculated . briefly",
    ", thirty - five objects were found to contain significant lithium and are classified accordingly as definite cluster members . assuming a cluster age of @xmath40myr , they range in mass from @xmath41-@xmath37 . a selection of these are shown in figure 2 , labelled with their @xmath4 magnitudes .",
    "all spectra have been normalised and had a constant offset applied , labels are @xmath4 magnitudes , width=264 ]",
    "figure 1 shows an ( @xmath4 , ) cmd with the lithium members drawn as closed triangles and non - members as open triangles , isochrones are calculated from the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models .",
    "there appears to be little correlation between the isochrones and the observed cluster sequence .",
    "this seems to confirm the known mis - match between model calculations of colours and their empirical counterparts .",
    "2mass @xmath42 band photometry was obtained for all but two of our targets , allowing us to construct an ( @xmath4 , @xmath43 ) cmd , see figure 3 .",
    "comparison between the identified cluster members and @xmath43 isochrones does provide a better match but suggests an age spread of @xmath44-@xmath18myr , even allowing for unresolved binary systems .",
    "figure 4 shows two histograms , the blue area representing the distribution of all @xmath27 spectroscopic targets in the survey , the red overlay corresponds to the @xmath45 objects in which lithium was detected .",
    "the inference drawn from this figure is that photometric selection alone is insufficient to identify cluster members .",
    "in addition , the fraction of non - members appears to increase with magnitude .",
    "thus a mass function based only on photometric criteria would over - estimate the numbers of brown dwarfs in the cluster with respect to higher mass stars .",
    "it is important to note though , that of the @xmath46 objects classified as non - members , several have spectra which display a very small signal to noise ratio .",
    "this means that we can not entirely rule out the presence of undepleted lithium within these objects , and consequently they may turn out to be cluster members .",
    "bejar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) present @xmath47 very low - mass @xmath6 orionis cluster member candidates using three colour ( @xmath4 , @xmath48 and @xmath42 ) photometry .",
    "we are able to identify eighteen of their objects within our own survey , of these we are convinced that eight definitely show lithium .",
    "however , five of their candidates show no clear evidence of cluster membership , these objects are all fainter than @xmath49 and are shown in figure 5 .",
    "this goes some way to demonstrating the importance of backing up photometric cluster membership with spectroscopy .",
    "we believe there is still much to be done with the dataset - current work involves determining radial velocities for all objects .",
    "this will provide a further discriminant between cluster members and contaminating objects , plus allow the detection of binary systems . to date , we have found seven potential spectroscopic binary systems among the @xmath45 lithium - rich objects , with implied maximum orbital periods of a few days .",
