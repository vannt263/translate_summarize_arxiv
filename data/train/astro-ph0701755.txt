    "large - scale galactic disk evolution is governed by the interaction between self - gravity and other reinforcing and/or countervailing forces .",
    "some of these forces are associated with sheared galactocentric rotation , and others are associated with random velocities ( thermal and turbulent ) of the gas and stars . under certain circumstances , gravitational instabilities may grow and radically alter the disk structure as they develop nonlinearly .",
    "this is believed to be how giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , and subsequently star - forming regions , originate . under other circumstances ,",
    "the overall disk morphology is not changed , but self - gravitating modes grow and interact in such a way that significant energy is transfered from ordered to disordered forms .",
    "this `` disk heating '' may in turn affect the system s subsequent susceptibility to self - gravitating instabilities .    because the gas component is much cooler than that of the stars , and because gas can radiate energy as it nonlinearly compressed , the effects of self - gravitating instabilities are much more pronounced in the interstellar medium ( ism ) than in the stellar disk .",
    "the stellar component can nevertheless be quite important to the initial growth of self - gravitating modes ( or waves ) , because it contains so much of the disk s mass ( @xmath8 , compared to @xmath9 in gas ) . while the stars are essentially collisionless , most previous work on gravitational instability in two - component disks has treated both stars and gas as two isothermal fluids with different sound speeds .",
    "this approach was taken by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in studying axisymmetric self - gravitating modes , and by @xcite in studying non - axisymmetric self - gravitating modes , for combined star / gas disks . adopting a full kinetic treatment for the stellar component in two - component disks , on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite used linear perturbation theory to derive dispersion relations for non - axisymmetric wkb waves and axisymmetric modes , respectively .",
    "these linear - theory analyses can not capture , however , the ultimate outcomes  including gmc formation and turbulent driving  which result when localized , self - gravitating structures grow ; quantifying this development requires nonlinear numerical simulations .    the main class of self - gravitating instability that develops under conditions of strong sheared rotation ( in outer galaxies , away from spiral arms ) is the swing amplifier @xcite . in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , we identified the basic requirements for swing to occur , and reported on the results of extensive numerical simulations of swing amplification in gaseous disks with or without magnetic fields .",
    "although in linear theory the amplification magnitude varies continuously with respect to the toomre parameter @xmath10 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ tq ] ] for definition ) , paper i showed that nonlinear interactions among swing - amplified density filaments or wavelets lead to a threshold phenomenon .",
    "disks with @xmath11 remain stable , while disks with @xmath12 experience gravitational runaway , forming bound condensations . for the razor - thin disk models of paper i",
    ", we found that @xmath13 , with the largest value resulting from models with subthermal magnetic fields .",
    "given the similarity between the numerically - obtained @xmath1 values and observationally inferred thresholds for active star formation in external galaxies @xcite , paper i supported the notion that self - gravitating instabilities define the star - formation `` edges '' of disks .    while successfully demonstrating the nonlinear threshold behavior of the swing amplifier , and quantitatively yielding good agreement with observations , the models considered in paper i suffered from two important drawbacks .",
    "first , by assuming infinitesimally thin disks , they overestimated self - gravity , which tends to overestimate @xmath1 ; second , they did not allow for a dynamically - active stellar disk , which tends to underestimate @xmath1 .",
    "subsequent simulations of pure - gas disks in three dimensions confirmed the basic nonlinear threshold behavior , but also showed that for realistic disk temperatures the nonzero thickness of the disk can indeed significantly lower the value of @xmath1 to @xmath14 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the second limitation of paper i by studying nonlinear evolution of gravitational instabilities in _ two - component _ galactic disks , consisting of both stars and gas .",
    "we distribute collisionless particles to represent stars and follow their orbits using a direct @xmath15-body method , while adopting a hydrodynamical approach for gas .",
    "the two components are allowed to interact with each other through the combined gravitational potential ( calculated on a single mesh ) .",
    "we also allow for nonzero ( and differing ) vertical thickness of both stellar and gaseous disks in solving the poisson equation for each component .",
    "given that finite thickness effects tend to reduce @xmath1 values below observed star formation thresholds in gas - only models , a compelling question is whether allowing for an active stellar disk compensates for this effect .",
    "thus , one of our primary objectives is to quantify the critical @xmath10 value for gravitational runaway when both a live stellar component and a thick disk are explicitly considered .",
    "a second important goal is to understand what happens when @xmath10 is sufficiently large that gravitational runaway does _ not _ occur .",
    "in particular , the large - scale flows that are driven when gravity is strong ( but not too strong ) may be a key to powering turbulence within the disk .",
    "many processes may contribute to turbulence in the diffuse gas .",
    "in addition to self - gravitating instabilities , other candidate mechanisms that have been proposed include thermal instabilities , the parker and magnetorotational instabilities , dynamical instabilities in spiral shocks , stellar winds , and expanding stellar regions and supernova blast waves ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . traditionally , stellar processes have been presumed to be the dominant turbulence drivers , but the lack of observed spatial correlation between velocity dispersions of gas and regions of high mass star formation @xcite argues that other sources must be important as well . in particular , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the swing amplifier generates large - scale motions that cascade to produce turbulence and structure on small scales as well as large scales .",
    "initial numerical studies of this process have been pursued by @xcite , who performed two - dimensional , thin - disk galactic simulations with ism cooling .",
    "they found that a cloudy medium develops , with a velocity dispersion @xmath16 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found via three - dimensional isothermal simulations , with sound speed @xmath17 and @xmath18 , that turbulence was driven to levels less than @xmath19 .",
    "based on just these few models , it has not yet been clear how important `` swing - driven '' turbulence is more generally .    in the present work ,",
    "we determine how the turbulent velocity amplitude of the gas , @xmath20 , varies as a function of @xmath10 , and also assess how the presence of a live stellar component affects @xmath20 . by running a number of models with a range of particle numbers , and also performing control models with `` passively - evolving '' stars ,",
    "we are able to subtract out the contribution to @xmath20 due to poisson noise in the particle distribution .",
    "we show that quite high particle resolution is in fact necessary for accurate determination of @xmath20 in the case when @xmath10 is near @xmath1 ; this is of practical importance because real disks naturally evolve toward near - critical states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we present the basic equations we solve for gas and stars , introduce `` thick - disk '' gravity , and describe our model parameters . in  3 , we revisit the linear theory for axisymmetric gravitational instability in two - component disks with an emphasis on the stabilizing effect of nonzero disk thickness ( omitted in previous studies ) . in  4 ,",
    "we describe numerical methods we employ for our simulations , and present results of code tests .",
    "we demonstrate that large poisson noise in the stellar particle distribution can lead to spurious results for @xmath15-body systems that are nearly or marginally gravitationally unstable . in  5 , we report on our simulations of two - component disks .",
    "we present numerical results on @xmath10 thresholds for ( non - axisymmetric ) gravitational runaway , and quantify the overall level and spectral properties of gravity - driven turbulence when @xmath21 finally , we summarize our results and discuss their astronomical implications in  6 .",
    "in this paper we investigate the dynamics of local galactic disks composed of gas and stars .",
    "we follow the evolution of the gas by solving the hydrodynamic equations , while employing an @xmath15-body method for the stars .",
    "the gas is assumed to be isothermal and unmagnetized , and we assume that all physical variables other than the gravitational potential are independent of the vertical height . as in paper",
    "i , we consider a patch of the disk orbiting the galaxy with a fixed angular frequency @xmath22 , and set up a local cartesian frame with @xmath23 and @xmath24 referring to radial and azimuthal coordinates , respectively .",
    "we consider a simulation box with size @xmath25 . the equilibrium background velocity arising from galactic rotation relative to the center of the box at @xmath26",
    "is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the dimensionless local shear rate .",
    "the basic dynamical equations we solve for the gaseous part in the local frame are identical to those presented in paper i , except that we adopt here a `` thick - disk '' gravitational kernel in solving the poisson equation ( see below ) .",
    "to follow the evolution of the stellar component , we use collisionless particles . restricting particle motions to be in - plane",
    ", the shearing - sheet equations of motion relative to the center of the box are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the position vector of a particle , the dots denote derivatives with respect to time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the gravitational potentials from gas and stars , respectively",
    ". the spatial distribution of the particles at any given time will give the stellar surface density @xmath33 , which in turn yields @xmath32 via @xmath34 here , @xmath35 represents the vertical distribution of the stellar density and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath36 . the poisson equation for",
    "the gas takes the same form as equation ( [ pstar ] ) with subscripts changed appropriately .",
    "studies of disk dynamics often assume @xmath37 for simplicity .",
    "this thin - disk approximation would be valid as long as perturbations of interest do not critically rely on the vertical dimension and their wavelengths @xmath38 are much larger than the disk scale height @xmath39 . for waves with @xmath38 approaching @xmath40 , however , the thin - disk approximation overestimates self - gravity at the disk midplane",
    ". this can be particularly severe in a two - component system in which the characteristic length scales and disk scale heights for gas and stars are quite different from each other .",
    "for instance , the critical wavelengths for axisymmetric gravitational instability under solar neighborhood conditions are @xmath41 kpc for stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath42 kpc for gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper i ) . the stellar scale height @xmath43 pc @xcite is non - negligible compared with the wavelength of the most vulnerable modes in the combined system .",
    "moreover , as perturbations grow via swing amplification they form thin overdense filaments with widths comparable to the gas disk s scale height ( paper i ; see also  [ nswing ] ) , so that the thin - disk gravity may potentially lead to spurious fragmentation .",
    "it is thus desirable to allow for finite disk thickness in solving equation ( [ pstar ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 does not vary with time and that @xmath44 is periodic in @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( or linear combinations of coordinates ; see  4.1 ) . using the green s function method , one can show that equation ( [ pstar ] ) yields the solution at @xmath45 ( omitting the subscript @xmath46 ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 refer to the fourier components with wavevector @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath51 , equation ( [ fou1 ] ) simply becomes @xmath52 which we refer to as `` thick - disk '' gravity , as opposed to thin - disk gravity for which @xmath53 is set equal to zero .",
    "this result was obtained through a different technique by @xcite and has been shown to be quite a good approximation for the reduction of self - gravity in disks with various density profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by direct numeral integration",

    "@xcite further found that when equation ( [ thick ] ) is used to calculate self - gravity , simulations of gas flow across two - dimensional spiral shocks produce results very similar to fully three - dimensional models . in",

    "the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 will vary over time as the particles respond to the perturbed gravitational potential .",

    "we initially adopt @xmath70 and @xmath71 corresponding to solar neighborhood conditions with a flat ( @xmath72 ) rotation curve @xcite .",
    "when written in dimensionless form , the basic dynamical equations are characterized by the following parameters @xmath73 @xmath74 together with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the toomre @xmath77 parameters defined by equation ( [ tq ] ) give the surface densities relative to the critical values at @xmath78 for axisymmetric gravitational instability in a razor - thin , gas - only or star - only disk @xcite . in equations ( [ nx ] ) , the @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) parameter is the ratio of the simulation box size @xmath81 to the critical wavelength @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for axisymmetric gravitational instability in a razor - thin , non - rotating gaseous ( rotating , cold stellar ) disk .",
    "since the parameter space is very large and since we are primarily interested in the dynamical evolution of the gaseous component in combined disks , we vary only @xmath10 ( or equivalently @xmath60 ) and fix all the other disk properties .",
    "for the stellar part , we adopt solar neighborhood values @xmath84 km s@xmath85 kpc@xmath85 @xcite , @xmath86 pc@xmath87 @xcite , and @xmath88 330 pc @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath89 , so that in our model disks the stellar component _",
    "alone _ , even in the razor - thin limit , would be immune to axisymmetric instability .",
    "we adopt @xmath90 pc for the effective scale height of the local ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the box size ,",
    "we adopt @xmath91 or @xmath92 kpc , which is large enough to resolve the most susceptible modes of the swing amplifier in stellar disks @xcite ; test simulations we have performed confirm that results are insensitive to @xmath80 as long as @xmath93 .",
    "our fiducial model has @xmath94 corresponding to @xmath95 pc@xmath87 for the gas disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but we also allow for various values of @xmath10 in the range of 1  3 .",
    "these models will allow us to determine the critical @xmath10 value for gravitational runaway and to study the characteristics and level of turbulence driven by self - gravity when @xmath21 .",
    "since equations ( [ tq ] ) and ( [ nx ] ) give @xmath96 for the adopted set of parameters , we see that our simulation box is large enough to contain at least 5 jeans wavelengths of the gaseous medium .",
    "we define the orbital period @xmath97 and use it as the time unit in our presentation .",
    "the gravitational stability of two - component disks to axisymmetric perturbations was first analyzed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who treated the stellar disk as an isothermal fluid .",
    "while a fluid description of stellar particles is a good approximation for a range of wavenumbers in disks near the threshold , it generally fails when disks are further from instability or when the wavelengths of perturbations are small compared to the epicyclic excursions of stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite instead used a collisionless description of the stellar population and derived a dispersion relation for axisymmetric waves in star - gas disks assuming that the disk is razor - thin . in this section ,",
    "we revisit axisymmetric instability with a particular emphasis on the effect of nonzero disk thickness .",
    "the results of this section will be used to check our numerical technique in ",
    "[ test ] .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed derivation leading to the thin - disk dispersion relation for two - component disks .",
    "we follow the same steps , except we use thick - disk equation ( [ thick ] ) for the potential and density pairs in place of rafikov s equation ( 14 ) .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation for axisymmetric modes in a two - component disk of finite vertical extent reads @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the frequency and radial wavenumber of perturbations , respectively , and @xmath101 is the stellar `` reduction factor '' defined by equation ( 6 - 45 ) of @xcite , which accounts for the effects of the stellar velocity dispersion . a similar relation was presented in @xcite who introduced a single effective scale height for the combined disk instead of using different heights @xmath56 and @xmath59 for each component . in the limit of @xmath102 , equation ( [ disp ] ) recovers the thin - disk dispersion relation of @xcite .",
    "note that although a combined thick disk can be mapped to a razor - thin counterpart with lower surface density , the density reduction factors of the gaseous and stellar components differ from each other and can not be determined a priori since they depend on the perturbation wavenumber .",
    "we determine the marginal stability condition by solving equation ( [ disp ] ) with @xmath103 , and plot the results in figure [ marg ] for selected values of @xmath104 .",
    "thick curves are for thick disks with scale heights @xmath90 pc and @xmath105 pc .",
    "results from @xcite for razor - thin disks are also plotted as light curves for comparison .",
    "the parameter domain below each marginal curve corresponds to the stable regime .",
    "it is apparent that axisymmetric gravitational instability is mainly determined by the gaseous component for small @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "when @xmath106 is small , the characteristic unstable length scales in ( standalone ) gaseous disks are much smaller than those of the stellar disk . in this case , the relative dominance of the gaseous to stellar components changes rather abruptly as @xmath10 and @xmath108 vary along a given marginal stability curve , as manifested by the cusp in the @xmath109 curve .",
    "as @xmath106 increases , the distinction between the characteristic length scales in the gas and stars becomes smaller , and the marginal curve bends smoothly .",
    "a system with solar neighborhood parameters , marked by the dot at @xmath110 , is highly stable to axisymmetric modes when treated as thick , while it would be marginally stable under the thin - disk approximation .    for varying disk thicknesses , figure [ qcrit ] plots the @xmath1 values , and the corresponding marginal wavelength of perturbations , @xmath111 ( @xmath112 modes are stable ) .",

    "this indicates that the stabilization caused by finite disk thickness is considerable , even larger than the destabilizing effect of stars .",
    "solutions of equation ( [ disp ] ) show that when @xmath115 and @xmath116 are fixed , thick disks with @xmath119 are stable to axisymmetric perturbations unless @xmath120 ( which is a very unrealistic range ) . therefore , the naive expectation that including a stellar component increases @xmath1 over unity fails in disks with realistic thickness .",
    "the fact that @xmath121 for observed star formation thresholds in disk galaxies has often been attributed to gravitational instabilities in two - component systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , our results show that _ axisymmetric _ modes can not be providing the needed instability , when disk thickness is properly considered .",
    "we will show in  5 that instead , swing amplification of _ non - axisymmetric _ perturbations are in fact able to drive two - component thick disks with @xmath122 into eventual gravitational runaway .",
    "we have run a number of two - dimensional simulations for star plus gas systems , varying @xmath10 and the number of stellar particles while fixing @xmath56 , @xmath59 , and @xmath108 .",
    "all the models have @xmath123 resolution .",
    "we follow the nonlinear evolution of the gaseous part using the same version of the zeus code @xcite as in paper i ; the reader is refereed to paper i for a detailed description of the code and the boundary conditions we adopt . in this subsection",
    ", we describe the numerical methods mainly for the stellar part .",
    "we use up to @xmath124 particles to represent a stellar disk and evolve them based on a particle - mesh ( pm ) algorithm . with its high velocity dispersion",
    ", the stellar component has a characteristic jeans scale much larger than that of gas , so the resolution limit imposed by the pm method is entirely tolerable . in addition , the relaxation time of the particles amounts to @xmath125 for the parameters we adopt , where @xmath126 is the grid size and @xmath127 is the mass of individual particles @xcite .",
    "this time is long enough to ensure that the evolution of the stellar system in our pm code is not seriously influenced by particle noise and relaxation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the initial distribution ( eq .  [ [ dist ] ] ) of the particle positions and velocities",
    "are realized using a pseudo - random number generator . at each time step , the stellar surface density @xmath33 is calculated on a @xmath123 mesh via the triangular - shaped - cloud assignment scheme @xcite .",
    "we solve equation ( [ thick ] ) by employing the fast fourier transform method on a sheared coordinate grid in which the surface density is perfectly periodic @xcite .",
    "the calculated potential is differentiated to give the gravitational force field at cartesian mesh zone centers , which is then interpolated back to the particle locations .",
    "we integrate equation ( [ eom ] ) using a modified predictor - corrector scheme which is second order accurate in time ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to handle the kinematics of the background shear self - consistently , we apply the shearing - box boundary conditions in which @xmath24-boundaries are perfectly periodic and the @xmath23-boundaries are shearing - periodic @xcite .",

    "evolution of linear waves in two - dimensional , shearing disks in principle would provide stringent tests for the current purposes , but we are unaware of test problems that have analytic solutions for comparison with numerical results",
    ". swing amplification in a combined disk would also be a useful test , but it is difficult to accurately measure the amplification magnitude from numerical simulations . propagating non - axisymmetric waves in a shearing disk also would be an excellent test problem for the gas component ( cf .",
    "paper i ) , but because of the lagrangian character it does not work as well for a stellar disk .",
    "we thus consider evolution of non - axisymmetric perturbations in non - shearing disks , for which equation ( [ disp ] ) still holds true if @xmath144 and @xmath145 are used .",
    "we have run a set of numerical simulations for stable / unstable waves in various types of non - shearing disks , and confirmed that numerical results are consistent with the analytic predictions , verifying again the accuracy of our numerical code .    of particular interest",
    "is the effect of poisson noise on gravitational instability in a stellar ( or combined ) system near the marginal state .",

    "although the linear theory suggests that a disk with these parameters should be stable , the maximum surface density in a model with @xmath131 grows secularly , prompting the formation of 4 clumps , as the left panel of figure [ 2d_test ] shows .",
    "the growth of perturbations in a model with @xmath148 is slower , displaying over - density honeycomb structures ( middle panel ) , while a model with @xmath149 has a stable density field oscillating mildly ( right panel ) . the mass - assignment scheme in our two - dimensional pm code yields poisson noise at the level @xmath150 , as measured by the standard deviation @xmath151 of the initial surface density @xmath61 .",

    "this implies that poisson noise can erroneously alter the fate of a numerically - modeled stellar system , especially when it is close to being marginal .",
    "this point has sometimes been overlooked in previous @xmath15-body simulations of disks .",
    "for example , @xcite simulated dynamics of non - shearing , local stellar disks using about 6,500 particles and found that disks with @xmath157 were unstable .",
    "they argued that the apparent discrepancy between the numerical and theoretical results might be partly because @xcite s wkb theory for density waves is incomplete and partly because their method for computing self - gravity is not very accurate .",
    "we suggest that large poisson noise alone , simply associated with a small number of particles , can explain their numerical results .",
    "adequate resolution is particularly an issue for global disk models , since the poisson noise on a given spatial scale is proportional to the linear size of the disk",
    ". some of the global simulations of @xcite and @xcite ( with @xmath158 star particles for the whole disk ) , for example , may be affected by amplification of noise .",
    "to investigate nonlinear evolution of two - component differentially - rotating disks with a range of gas mass fractions , we have run a number of non - axisymmetric models .",
    "we fix @xmath72 , @xmath89 , @xmath91 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and vary @xmath10 in the range of 1 to 3 . for these parameters ,",

    "solutions for self - consistent vertical equilibria show that @xmath56 decreases only by @xmath161 as @xmath10 decreases from 1.4 to 1.0 @xcite , so that we expect using a fixed value of @xmath56 does not significantly impact our quantitative results .",
    "we set up initially uniform gaseous and stellar disks , and apply density perturbations only to the gaseous component . due to randomness in particle locations , the stellar part already has white - noise density perturbations with amplitudes of @xmath162 when @xmath124 which will be immediately transmitted into the gaseous disk . in order to keep the poisson noise from dominating the evolution of the gaseous disk , we impose rather strong gaseous density perturbations using a gaussian random field with a power spectrum @xmath163 for @xmath164 in fourier space .",

    "although this level of density fluctuations is chosen as a compromise between maintaining the initial perturbations in the linear regime and reducing the effect of poisson noise on the simulation outcomes , it may in fact well represent initial conditions for the highly - turbulent ism observed in real disk galaxies .",
    "we begin with a high - resolution model with @xmath166 and @xmath124 . for this model ,",
    "the combined gravity of gas and stars induces efficient swing amplification , leading to gravitational runaway .",

    "coherent perturbations in stars and gas begin to develop through gravitational interactions . due to the uniform background shear ,",
    "the radial wavenumber @xmath169 of perturbations increases linearly with time as @xmath170 where @xmath171 denotes the @xmath24-wavenumber and @xmath172 is the initial @xmath23-wavenumber of perturbations .",
    "this kinematic shift of @xmath169 causes wavefronts to swing from leading to trailing .",
    "epicyclic motion of both stellar particles and gaseous fluid elements has the same rotational sense as the wavefronts , extending their exposure to self - gravity as they linger in wave crests .",
    "perturbations keep growing until the radial wavenumber becomes large , forming over - dense , trailing wavelets ( @xcite ; paper i ) .    the modal growth of density perturbations via swing amplification in the @xmath166 model",
    "is well illustrated in figure [ modes ] where we plot the evolution of power spectra of the gaseous surface density as functions of the normalized wavenumber @xmath173 . only the modes with @xmath174 and @xmath175 that have large amplitudes are shown .",
    "note that a unity increment of @xmath176 along each curve corresponds to a time elapse of @xmath177 .",
    "it is apparent that swing amplification is active only when waves are loosely wound with @xmath178 above which sonic oscillations quench the perturbation growth .",
    "the @xmath179 mode that happens to have the largest initial power grows and emerges first , as manifested by the trailing modes with @xmath180 shown in the top panels of figure [ snapq10 ] .",
    "however , it is the modes with @xmath181 that eventually dominate the initial swing amplification , since they have longer time for growth .",
    "as figures [ 2d_evol ] and [ modes ] show , the initial swing amplification in the @xmath182 model saturates at around @xmath183 . at this time",
    ", the gaseous surface density reaches @xmath184 , while the stellar component reaches only @xmath185 . the stellar component s density increases less due to its larger initial values of @xmath108 and @xmath59 , and the steady heating associated with particle scattering off shearing wavelets . while the maximum gas surface density is rather high when the swing amplifier saturates , the gas filaments are very thin . reduction of self - gravity due to finite disk thickness prevents these filaments from immediately undergoing gravitational collapse .",
    "the filaments expand slightly , reducing their surface density .",
    "some filaments have sufficient perturbed velocities to offset the tendency for wave rotation of the background shear .",
    "consequently , the pitch angles of these high - density filaments vary little ; they can be viewed as transient ( swing - generated ) spiral density waves in a two - component disk .",
    "figure [ spiral ] plots sample cut profiles of various quantities along the @xmath186 dotted lines in the snapshot shown in the middle row of figure [ snapq10 ] .",
    "the gas filament has a pitch angle @xmath187 and is almost corotating with the center of the box ; it coincides with a local stellar enhancement such that the composite may be considered a transient , local spiral arm segment . as the gas at @xmath188 enters the arm , it is decelerated and compressed , analogous to a supersonic de laval flow .",
    "this in turn increases the velocity parallel to the arm due to the constraint of potential vorticity conservation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the gravitational potential is dominated by the gaseous component , which tends to symmetrize the density profile with respect to the peak @xcite .",
    "the structure of this filament persists until @xmath189 when collisions with other filaments make it highly self - gravitating .",
    "paper i found that formation of bound clouds in swing - amplified disks occurs generically through one of the three secondary instabilities . in order of decreasing self - gravity ,",
    "these are : ( i ) parallel fragmentation of filaments ; ( ii ) gravitational collisions of shearing wavelets ; and ( iii ) rejuvenated swing amplification preceded by nonlinear wave interactions .",
    "as explained above , high - density filaments in the @xmath166 model do not immediately fragment due to thick - disk gravity . only after several collisions with neighboring filaments",
    "is the density high enough to form gravitationally bound condensations .",
    "as figure [ snapq10 ] shows , the @xmath166 model forms 14 bound gaseous clouds , the average mass of which is @xmath190 , roughly 10 times larger than the jeans mass @xmath191 in the corresponding gas - only , razor - thin disk . for comparison , in the @xmath182 models of paper i , the condensations that formed had @xmath192 , suggesting that the effect of finite disk thickness ( combined with an active stellar disk ) is non - negligible in setting the cloud masses that form .",
    "we note that the bound condensations that form in our models may represent superclouds observed in many disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our models ( isothermal , without feedback ) , these superclouds keep collapsing in a runaway fashion to the resolution limit .",
    "an artificial consequence of the runaway cloud collapse , at highly nonlinear stages , is the formation of loose stellar aggregates , as figure [ snapq10 ] displays .",
    "note that all the stellar clumps coincide with the massive gaseous clumps .",
    "in realistic situations , however , gaseous superclouds would presumably fragment into lower - mass gmcs when appropriate physical processes such as internal turbulence are included .",
    "if @xmath193 and @xmath194 denote the mass and size of superclouds , respectively , stars would be drawn in strongly only if @xmath195 pc for @xmath196 and @xmath70 .",
    "this corresponds to a supercloud surface density @xmath197 pc@xmath87 , comparable to the typical surface density of a gmc . as long as gmcs are destroyed by star formation before the whole supercloud reaches a density as large as that of an individual gmc ( which is observationally true ) , stellar clumps would not be produced in reality .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure [ 2d_evol ] , the stellar velocity dispersion in",
    "this model continually increases as individual stars scatter off stellar and , more importantly , gaseous filaments formed via swing amplification .",
    "this process is somewhat analogous to heating of a stellar disk by transient spiral density waves ( e.g , @xcite ) , although the runaway fragmentation and collapse of gaseous fragments in our two - component models cause the stellar velocity dispersions to rise more rapidly than in star - only systems .",
    "figure [ 2d_evol ] shows that a model with @xmath133 also becomes unstable , but with weaker gaseous gravity it takes longer to reach gravitational collapse .",
    "the first - generation filaments formed in this model do not fragment directly , and unlike in the @xmath182 model collisions do not yield merger - induced fragmentation .",
    "instead , the structures nonlinearly interact with each other and supply fresh , small-@xmath198 modes that undergo subsequent swing amplification ( paper i ; see also @xcite for its stellar analog ) .",
    "four successive stages of `` rejuvenated '' swing amplification ( from interactions of filaments of order unity amplitudes ) are required to drive the @xmath133 model into eventual gravitational runaway .",
    "the average mass of gaseous clouds that form is again @xmath199 .    when we further reduce the gas surface density so that @xmath94 , the initial swing amplification yields a moderately self - gravitating state that never forms bound clumps over the course of the simulation .",
    "as figure [ snapq14 ] shows , the gaseous component in this model is dominated by shearing wavelets ( and the related velocity field ) .",
    "mild rejuvenated swing amplification allows the peak gaseous surface density and velocities to grow steadily , reaching the nonlinear regime",
    ". the stellar velocity dispersions also grow , but the net increase is less than 10% at @xmath200 ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d_evol ] ) ; the stellar disk also remains virtually uniform with only very low fluctuations in density .",
    "we regard this model as `` marginal '' because it would almost certainly end up with bound condensations if evolved over a sufficiently long time .",
    "in other models with @xmath201 , growth is so weak that perturbed surface densities remain in the linear regime at saturation of the first swing amplification .",
    "rejuvenation of swing is almost absent in these models , so that the combined systems can be considered nonlinearly stable .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the threshold for gravitational instability in combined gas - star disks has @xmath10 near 1.4 .",
    "we now examine the properties of turbulence generated by swing amplification in two - component disks .",
    "we define @xmath202 , representing the specific kinetic energy associated with turbulent velocities in the the gas .",

    "[ test ] that large poisson noise in a particle distribution effectively increases the mean surface density of stars in local regions , and can even incur spurious gravitational instability .",
    "similarly , random particle noise can artificially  and possibly significantly  enhance the saturated state value of @xmath203 .",
    "we want to measure @xmath203 in a way that minimizes the effect of particle noise . to this end",

    "no initial perturbation is applied to the gas , but the gas responds to the poisson noise of the stars .",

    "figure [ q14 ] displays evolutionary histories of @xmath203 for @xmath94 models that differ in the number of particles and the treatment of gravity for the stellar component .",
    "the thick curves correspond to runs following ( i ) above , while thin lines correspond to runs following ( ii ) . in the cases with full gravity ,",
    "the systems relax after the initial swing amplification , with @xmath204 decreasing temporarily as some of the gaseous kinetic energy is transferred via sound waves and/or weak shocks into thermal energy that dissipates under the isothermal prescription . the continuous input from stellar perturbations as well as nonlinear feedback from the shearing wavelets cause a resumed increase in @xmath204 .",
    "after @xmath209 orbits , models with gravitating stars show a secular increase of @xmath204 . on the other hand , in models where the stars evolve passively , the initial swing is weak enough that @xmath206 simply saturates at a constant ( low ) value .",
    "other models ( not shown ) with @xmath210 show that both @xmath204 and @xmath206 are more or less constant after @xmath211 , because swing amplification is very mild .",

    "more generally , it is clear that there are progressively smaller differences between @xmath20 and @xmath216 as @xmath10 decreases , indicating that the contribution from swing - amplified poisson noise to @xmath216 becomes increasingly unimportant at lower @xmath10 .    even after @xmath206  embodying the kinetic energy directly induced in the _ gaseous _ disk by the _",
    "stellar _ poisson noise  has been subtracted , figure [ turb ] shows that @xmath20 still depends on @xmath142 .",
    "this is because the gas responds to swing - amplified perturbations in the stars that partly originate as noise in the initial stellar distribution .",
    "note , however , that @xmath20 clearly converges with increasing @xmath142 , implying that this secondary noise effect becomes negligible .",
    "the convergence study suggests that @xmath20 at @xmath124 provides a clean measure of the turbulent energy that is uncontaminated by effects of poisson noise .",
    "our results also imply that numerical simulations of marginally - unstable galactic disks are not reliable if insufficiently many particles are employed for the collisionless part .",
    "figure [ turb](b ) plots @xmath20 for two - component disks with @xmath217 as well as the velocity dispersion for gas - only disks . for stable systems with @xmath218 ,",

    "this suggests not only that the stellar disk can significantly affect driving of gaseous turbulence , but also that self - gravity combined with galactic shear is capable of inducing sonic - level gaseous turbulence under realistic disk conditions .    to characterize the turbulence generated by swing amplification , we plot in figure [ vpow ] fourier power spectra of the compressive and shear components of gaseous velocities defined by @xmath220 respectively . here",

    "we have also calculated the density power spectra and confirmed that they follow the compressive velocity power spectra very closely .",
    "the velocity power spectra are clearly anisotropic , as is typical of turbulence in systems with strong background shear ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "comparisons of figure [ vpow]@xmath225,@xmath226 reveal that the ratio of total power in the shearing to compressive parts is about 1.5 .",
    "this value is quite small compared to @xmath227 found in recent simulations of hypersonic turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , presumably reflecting the facts that ( i ) our models are subsonic or weakly supersonic at best , so that compressions are not strongly dissipated , and ( ii ) driving by self - gravity favors pumping of compressive motions .",
    "although the power spectra vary too much at low @xmath100 to yield clean power - law indices and are affected by numerical dissipation at high @xmath100 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our results are consistent with @xmath228 in the inertial range .",
    "the cuts along the @xmath229-axis exhibit a break near @xmath230 , below which the power flattens and above which @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "about 85% of the turbulent power is in large scales modes with @xmath233 , suggesting that the small - scale turbulent velocity dispersion is a small fraction of the total ; this proportion could , however , differ in three - dimensional models .",

    "nonlinear interactions of shearing wavelets evidently supply fresh power into small-@xmath198 modes at just the rate needed to compensate for the kinematic shift of @xmath229 due to shear , such that the shape of the power spectrum is nearly flat . while turbulent energy cascades to small scales appear to shape power spectra along the @xmath171-direction , shear and nonlinear feedback clearly dominate energy flows in the @xmath229-direction .",

    "this result is in fact nearly identical to the nonlinear threshold value @xmath246 we found in paper i ( for unmagnetized models ) , due to compensation between two effects that were not accounted for in paper i. the current models allow for a ( stabilizing ) nonzero disk thickness , and include a ( destabilizing ) active stellar component ; although each effect by itself makes a significant difference in @xmath1 , in net they nearly cancel each other .",
    "while the present models do not include magnetic fields , we expect that inclusion of magnetic effects would not significantly change the results ; in paper i , there was only a @xmath165 change in @xmath1 even with equipartition - strength large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "an open question is how sensitive @xmath1 is to the precise parameters characterizing the stellar disk . to define a manageable parameter space , we have fixed the value of @xmath108 to 2.1 , the ( initial ) ratio of the stellar velocity dispersion to the gas sound speed to 4.3 , and the ratio of stellar to gas disk thicknesses to 1.9 .",
    "the values chosen for these parameters are based on solar - neighborhood observations , and thus are representative of conditions in the middle of the galactic disk for a late - type spiral .",
    "although the stellar component s parameters surely vary from the deep interior to the outer reaches of a galactic disk , constraining the relevant quantities observationally is in fact quite challenging .",
    "extragalactic studies @xcite are consistent with the stellar disk thicknesses being independent of radius at least for late - type spirals . in this case ,",
    "a ( self - gravitating ) stellar disk with a constant ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersion will have @xmath247 .",
    "for an exponential stellar surface density @xmath248 with scale length @xmath249 , this would imply that the variation of @xmath108 over @xmath250 is less than 30% .",
    "furthermore , @xmath108 varies over only a small range from one galaxy to another ; @xcite found that @xmath251 fits the data well ( consistent with theoretical predictions of e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , although we obtained the result @xmath252 for a specific set of stellar parameters , the modest variation in these parameters among and within real galaxies suggests that there would be a correspondingly modest variation in @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that measured values of @xmath10 at the observed threshold radii for star formation are around @xmath253 @xcite . unless the stellar properties at these threshold radii differ dramatically from those we have adopted , the results of our work , showing @xmath254 within the same range , quantitatively support the possibility that star formation thresholds and ( nonaxisymmetric ) gravitational instability thresholds are likely to be one and the same .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached very recently by @xcite , who performed global sph + @xmath15-body simulations and found that a critical `` combined star - gas '' toomre parameter of @xmath255 defines the limit between gravitationally - stable and unstable disks .",
    "of course , turbulence driven by swing amplification could change the effective value of @xmath10 if it contributes a stabilizing pressure in a manner similar to the microphysical random motions , and if the turbulent amplitudes are large .",
    "since the threshold radii are by definition where disks become stable , however , then @xmath256 in those locations and there would not be a significant contribution from swing - driven turbulence .",
    "we note that many physical processes not included in the current models may potentially change @xmath1 for gravitational runaway .",
    "these include turbulence pervasive in the ism , and thermal and other dynamical instabilities .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that nonlinear density fluctuations driven by magnetorotational instability in gas - only , three - dimensional disks enhance @xmath1 by about 50% relative to those in unmagnetized counterparts .",
    "it is especially important to explore the effects of turbulent motions and magnetic fields in multiphase systems , because the thermal velocity dispersion of cold gas is so low .",
    "the usual assumption is that an effective @xmath77 can be defined by appropriate weighting of various contributing effective pressures and surface density components ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; an important direction for future research is to test this idea rigorously . , since naive inclusion of the radial turbulent velocities that are present ( @xmath257 ) at both small and large scales increases @xmath10 by @xmath258 . ] in future work , it will be interesting to test whether realistic turbulent , multi - phase models ( in 3d or with thick - disk 2d gravity ) show nonlinear threshold behavior for a suitably defined @xmath259 , and how a live stellar component quantitatively affects critical @xmath77 values .    the fact that the stellar disk plays a significant role in destabilizing the gas disk",
    "may help explain the very low star formation rates in late - type , low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "while lsb galaxies are often comparable in total gas mass to normal galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , most of them have gas surface densities below the threshold values @xmath260 corresponding to @xmath94 , such that low star formation rates and weak stellar disks are easily explained ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , some lsb galaxies with @xmath261 still evidence little star formation ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in part , this is probably because @xmath108 is so large that the stellar disk does little to encourage instability in the gas disk ; we found that pure - gas disks are still quite stable when @xmath133 .",
    "in addition , without the vertical gravity of a massive stellar disk , the gas disk thickness will increase by a factor of 1.52 ( e.g. @xcite ) compared to that in a normal galaxy",
    ". a larger value of @xmath56 dilutes gravity , which tends to further lower @xmath1 .",
    "together , these effects will reduce @xmath1 below 1 for lsb galaxies , making them more stable than previously thought .",
    "galactic differential rotation represents a bountiful store of kinetic energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and we have shown that swing amplification in two - component disks is able to transform this energy into ism turbulent motions with appreciable amplitudes .",
    "other mechanisms that can channel sheared rotation into turbulence in the diffuse ism include the magnetorotational instability @xcite , and interactions with spiral arms ( @xcite ) .",
    "our current simulations show that provided that the disk is marginal or unstable , swing amplification is at least as efficient as the magnetorotational instability under conditions of comparable surface density .",
    "two - phase self - gravitating hydrodynamic models @xcite and self - gravitating dissipative cloud - fluid models @xcite have similarly concluded that self - gravity coupled with galactic rotation can produce ism turbulence that is sustained over many galactic rotations .",
    "driving of turbulence at levels @xmath262 requires a disk to be at least marginally unstable . because the outer , low - surface density regions of disks are quite stable , this mechanism can not drive turbulence there .",
    "but in the inner parts of disks , self - gravitational stirring in some regions ( having slightly lower density ) may go hand - in - hand with formation of massive , star - forming clouds in other regions ( having slightly higher density ) . because the fraction of gas converted to stars per cloud formation epoch is quite small ( @xmath263% ) , the rate of reduction in the mean gas surface density  and hence rate of increase in @xmath10  is very low . as @xmath10 increases over time , the timescale for cloud formation via gravitational instability also increases .",
    "the overall evolution is toward an asymptotic state in which @xmath10 approaches @xmath1 .",
    "galaxies may naturally `` fine - tune '' their parameters in such a way that self - gravity can help stabilize small scales  by generating turbulence  even as it forces large scales into collapse .",

    "<S> galactic disks consist of both stars and gas . </S>",
    "<S> the gas is more dynamically responsive than the stars , and strongly nonlinear structures and velocities can develop in the interstellar medium ( ism ) even while stellar surface density perturbations remain fractionally small . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the stellar component still significantly influences the gas . </S>",
    "<S> we use two - dimensional numerical simulations to explore formation of bound condensations and turbulence generation in the gas of two - component galactic disks . </S>",
    "<S> we represent the stars with collisionless particles and follow their orbits using a particle - mesh method , and treat the gas as an isothermal , unmagnetized fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the two components interact through a combined gravitational potential , which accounts for the distinct vertical thickness of each disk . </S>",
    "<S> we ensure our results are not contaminated by particle poisson noise , which can seriously compromise simulations of self - gravitating systems . using stellar parameters typical of mid - disk conditions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that models with gaseous toomre parameter @xmath0 experience gravitational runaway and eventually form bound condensations . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath1 value is nearly the same as previously found for razor - thin , gas - only models , indicating that the destabilizing effect of live stars is offsets the reduced self - gravity of thick disks . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also consistent with empirical studies showing that star formation is suppressed when @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the bound gaseous structures that form have mass @xmath3 each , @xmath4 times larger than the thin - disk jeans mass for a gas - only disk ; these represent superclouds that would subsequently fragment into gmcs . </S>",
    "<S> self - gravity and sheared rotation also interact to drive turbulence in the gas when @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this turbulence is anisotropic , with more power in sheared than compressive motions . </S>",
    "<S> the gaseous velocity dispersion is @xmath6 times the thermal speed when @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that gravity is important in driving ism turbulence in many spiral galaxies , since the low efficiency of star formation naturally leads to a state of marginal instability . </S>"
