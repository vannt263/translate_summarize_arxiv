    "the question we address is whether the incoherent state is stable . in particular , as a system parameter such as the coupling strength varies , the onset of instability of the incoherent state signals the start of coherent , synchronous behavior of the ensemble .",
    "to perform the stability analysis , we assume that the system is in the incoherent state , so that at any fixed time @xmath35 , and for each @xmath18 , @xmath36 is distributed according to the natural measure .",

    "( [ mtilde_avginside ] ) is independent of @xmath35 .",

    "then , at @xmath67 , we apply an equal infinitesimal displacement @xmath78 in the direction @xmath75 to each orbit in the cloud .",
    "that is , we replace @xmath21 by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a unit vector in @xmath81-space in the direction @xmath75 . since the particle cloud is displaced from the attractor , it relaxes back to the attractor as time evolves .",

    "we now argue that @xmath83 decays to zero exponentially with increasing time .",
    "we consider the general case where the support of the smooth density @xmath30 contains open regions of @xmath84 for which the dynamical system ( [ ithuncoupled ] ) has attracting periodic orbits as well as a positive measure of @xmath84 on which eq .",
    "( [ ithuncoupled ] ) has chaotic orbits .",
    "numerical experiments on chaotic attractors ( including structurally unstable attractors ) generally show that they are strongly mixing ; i.e. , a cloud of many particles rapidly arranges itself on the attractor according to the natural measure .",
    "thus , for each @xmath85 giving a chaotic attractor , it is reasonable to assume that the average of @xmath48 over initial conditions @xmath21 , denoted @xmath86 , decays exponentially . for a periodic attractor , however",
    ", @xmath86 does not decay : a distribution of orbits along a limit cycle comes to the same distribution after one period , and this repeats forever . thus , if the distribution on the limit cycle was noninvariant , it remains noninvariant and oscillates forever at the period of the periodic orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "periodic orbits exist in open regions of @xmath84 , and , when we average over @xmath84 , there is the possibility that with increasing time cancellation causing decay occurs via the process of `` phase mixing''@xcite .",
    "for this case we appeal to an example .",
    "in particular , the explicit computation of @xmath86 for a simple model limit cycle ensemble is given in sec .",

    "however , if we average over the oscillator distribution @xmath88 we obtain @xmath89,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for any analytic @xmath88 these integrals decay",
    "exponentially with time .",
    "thus , based on these considerations of chaotic and periodic attractors , we see that for sufficiently smooth @xmath92 , there is reason to believe that @xmath83 , the average of @xmath48 over @xmath21 and over @xmath85 , decays exponentially to zero with increasing time .",
    "conjecturing this decay to be exponential , @xmath93 for positive constants @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we see that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ mtilde_timeindep ] ) converges for @xmath96 .",
    "this conjecture is supported by our numerical results in sec .",
    "[ numericalexperiments ] .",
    "thus , while eq .",
    "( [ mtilde_timeindep ] ) was derived under the assumption @xmath97 , using analytic continuation , we can regard eq .",
    "( [ mtilde_timeindep ] ) as valid for @xmath98 .",
    "note that , for our purposes , it suffices to require only that @xmath99 be bounded , rather than that it decay exponentially .",
    "boundedness corresponds to @xmath100 , which is enough for us , since , as soon as instability occurs , the relevant root of @xmath3 has @xmath2 .",
    "we can envision the following numerical method for finding @xmath101 .",
    "first approximate the natural measure of each attractor @xmath18 by a large _ finite _ number of orbits initially distributed according to the natural measure .",
    "for each initial condition , obtain @xmath36 from eq .",
    "( [ ithuncoupled ] ) . then use these solutions in @xmath102 and solve eq .",
    "( [ variationaleq ] ) . finally , average the resulting matrix solutions @xmath48 over the orbits .",
    "while this may look attractive , it can present difficulties in the case of chaotic orbits .",
    "in particular , chaos implies that the individual @xmath48 diverge exponentially , while the average over the natural invariant measure @xmath86 decays .",
    "that is , when we average over the natural invariant measure , the exponential divergence of the individual @xmath41 cancel to yield decay .",
    "numerically , however , we average over a large but finite number of orbits . for early time",
    ", one can expect that this will give a good approximation to @xmath86 .",
    "however , as time goes on , the decay of @xmath86 implies that the cancellation must become more and more accurate because the individual @xmath48 become larger and larger .",
    "thus , eventually , any numerical approximation using a finite number of orbits must diverge .",
    "the question is , can one obtain results by this method that are accurate for long enough time to provide a useful basis for approximating @xmath53 .",
    "we expand and illustrate this issue in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ numericalexperiments ] .",
    "a variant of the above numerical technique is to obtain @xmath83 by working directly with the uncoupled nonlinear equations ( [ ithuncoupled ] ) .",
    "we use a large finite number of initial conditions chosen randomly with respect to @xmath30 and the natural invariant measure .",
    "these initial conditions are then all displaced , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is small . denoting the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ ithuncoupled ] ) with these displaced initial conditions @xmath106 , we then approximate the quantity @xmath107 , which represents the relaxation of the measure s centroid after a displacement @xmath108 . in the limit @xmath109 , we have that the @xmath75th column of @xmath101 is @xmath110_k=\\delta _ k^{-1}(\\langle \\langle { \\bf x}\\rangle \\rangle _ * - \\langle \\langle { \\bf x}'\\rangle \\rangle ) , \\label{kthcolofm}\\ ] ] and eq .",
    "( [ kthcolofm ] ) is used , with small @xmath111 , as an approximation . again , practical numerical issues exist for this technique",
    ". in particular , @xmath105 must be small for linearity to be approximated , but this makes the cancellation of @xmath112 stronger , which , in turn , necessitates using many initial conditions .",
    "also , as time increases , @xmath101 decreases , and fluctuations of @xmath112 due to the finite number of initial conditions can overwhelm the computation of the coherent relaxation to the attractor ( see sec .",
    "[ numericalexperiments ] ) .",
    "since @xmath83 is the response to an impulse drive , its laplace transform multiplied by @xmath114 , @xmath115 , is the response to a drive @xmath116 .",
    "we now show this more formally .",
    "first we note that eq .",
    "( [ variationaleq ] ) with the initial condition @xmath117 at @xmath67 can be written in the impulse response form , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a delta function , and @xmath48 satisfies the initial condition @xmath120 at @xmath121 . shifting time by @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 where we have explicitly included the dependence of @xmath48 on time and on the initial state @xmath124 of the unperturbed orbit @xmath36 . multiplying by @xmath125 and integrating over all @xmath122 we obtain @xmath126 where @xmath127 which converges at the lower limit provided @xmath128 is sufficiently large . introducing @xmath129 , averaging , and , as before , interchanging the order of the average and the integral , we have that the response to @xmath116 is , as claimed , @xmath130 .",
    "this suggests the following numerical technique for finding @xmath53 .",

    "thus the @xmath75th column of @xmath53 is @xmath135_k\\simeq \\delta _ k^{-1}e^{-st}[\\langle \\langle { \\bf x}\\rangle \\rangle _ * - \\langle \\langle \\tilde { \\bf x}\\rangle \\rangle ] , \\label{afterfreqresponse}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 .",
    "numerically @xmath137 can be approximated using a large finite number of orbits . in ref .",

    "numerically , it is observed that as the coupling is varied , a hopf bifurcation occurs .",
    "thus , for conditions just past the bifurcation , the order parameter variation is sinusoidal , @xmath139 . using this as the drive in the nonlinear equation , as in eq .",

    ", the frobenius - perron equation plays the role of eq .",
    "( [ distfunappr ] ) , and the average over parameters is not present .",

    ", we note that @xmath156 is often extremely singular both in its dependence on @xmath81 ( because the measure on a chaotic attractor is typically a multifractal ) and on @xmath84 ( because chaotic attractors are often structurally unstable ) .",

    "( [ first ] ) , we can seek intuition from standard results on the generic bifurcations of a fixed point of a system of ordinary differential equations ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are two linear means by which such a fixed point can become unstable :  ( i ) a real solution of @xmath0 can pass from negative to positive @xmath1 values , and ( ii ) two complex conjugate solutions , @xmath1 and @xmath165 , can cross the imaginary @xmath1-axis , moving from @xmath166 to @xmath2 .    in reference to case ( i ) , we note that the incoherent steady state always exists for our formulation in sec .",

    "[ numericalexperiments ] we find cases of apparent subcritical and supercritical hopf bifurcations , as well as a case of what we believe is a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "the reason we believe it is a pitchfork rather than a transcritical bifurcation is that our globally coupled system is a collection of coupled lorenz equations . since the lorenz equations @xmath169 have the symmetry @xmath170 , and since the form of the coupling used in sec .",
