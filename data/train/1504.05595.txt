    ". the normalization of the electron distribution is parametrized by the emitted synchrotron luminosity , @xmath30 .",
    "the emitting regions contain a tangled magnetic field @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the relativistic beaming is specified by the two lorentz factors @xmath33 , @xmath34 and by the viewing angle @xmath35 .",
    "electrons emit through synchrotron and ic mechanisms .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath36 = 10@xmath37@xmath38@xmath39 cm and for @xmath40 = 3@xmath3810@xmath41 erg s@xmath12 we obtain @xmath36 = 2@xmath3810@xmath42 cm .",
    "therefore the emitting region should be beyond the blr and for this reason the external compton of the blr seed photons should be negligible . for the ic besides the local synchrotron radiation field ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ) we consider the beamed radiation field of the other component . indeed , because of the relative motion , the energy density of radiation produced in one component is boosted by the square of the relative lorentz factor @xmath43 in the rest frame of the other , where @xmath44 .",
    "as we will see , absorption of @xmath1-rays through the interaction with the soft radiation field , @xmath45 can be important . in the case under study",

    "we note that the number of the parameters is large ( almost twice that of the simple ssc model ) . however , the model has to satisfy constraints that can be used as guidelines in selecting the suitable setup .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion .    following the indications recalled in the previous subsections we consider angles larger than those usually associated with blazar jets , @xmath48 .",
    "[ sed ] we show the results of the modeling of the sed with three different angles , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding parameters are reported in table  [ tabparam ] .",
    "we expect that , for relatively small angles , the spine radiation is much more boosted than that of the layer , implying that the spine emission component largely dominates the observed sed .",
    "this solution is that assumed for the case @xmath49 ( upper panel ) .",
    "the relative stability of the low - energy component accompanied by the variation which occurred in the ic peak is obtained by changing the layer luminosity ( and maintaining almost the same parameters for the spine ) .",
    "in fact , the spine ic bump is dominated in the high state by the component resulting from the ic scattering of the electrons in the spine with the photons coming from the layer .",
    "variations of the layer luminosity are thus accompanied by substantial variations of the ic luminosity of the spine .    for larger angles",
    "the only suitable solution is that the two bumps are dominated by the two jet components , i.e. the low energy bump by the synchrotron component of the spine and the high energy bump by the ic emission of the layer ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for @xmath52 ( middle panel )",
    "the model still reproduces quite well the data . in this case",
    "we also assume a stationary spine and a variable layer component .",
    "a further increase of the angle ( lower panel ) is limited by a problem already discussed in @xcite . indeed , to compensate the reduced relativistic amplification of the spine emission one has to increase its intrinsic luminosity .",
    "this radiation field  concentrated in the optical - ir band  is the ideal target for the pair producing reactions @xmath53 with @xmath1-ray photons produced in the layer . in fig .",
    "[ tau ] , we show the optical depth @xmath54 and the corresponding  suppression factor \" @xmath55/\\tau_{\\gamma \\gamma}$ ] as a function of the frequency for the case @xmath52 and @xmath56 .",
    "the shapes of the curves , related to the spine target photon spectrum , are similar .",
    "however , due to the larger intrinsic luminosity , for @xmath57 the optical depth is larger by a factor of @xmath58 . as a consequence , while @xmath59 the source is transparent ( @xmath60 up to @xmath61 gev , corresponding to the highest - energy lat bin in the high state , energy marked by the vertical yellow line ) , for @xmath57 , the optical depth reaches unity already at @xmath62 gev and rapidly increases , determining the abrupt cut  off visible in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that , in the framework of the structured jet model , the angle can not be larger than about @xmath50 .",
    "in the unification scheme for radio galaxies and blazars we expect that , once observed at small angles , the sed of a radio galaxy resembles that of a typical blazar . therefore for the remaining two cases , @xmath49 and @xmath50 one can further ask what kind of sed would the source present if observed at angles more typical for blazars .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ aligned ] , in which we report the sed as recorded by an observer at @xmath63 , not changing the other parameters .",
    "for comparison we also display the historical sed of bl lacertae .",
    "the case @xmath52 ( green ) results in an sed strongly unbalanced ( by a factor @xmath64 ) toward the synchrotron luminosity , at odds with the typical blazar sed .",
    "this effect is clearly related to the fact that the high - energy bump in the case @xmath52 is associated with the layer . at small angles ,",
    "the layer radiation is much less beamed than that of the spine and this determines the substantial prominence of the low - energy peak . on the contrary , the sed for case @xmath49 ( red ) resembles that of the prototypical bl lac .",
    "this suggests that a viewing angle between @xmath65 and @xmath50 is favored .",
    "in addition in the spine - layer scenario proposed here , the fast variability observed in @xmath1-rays is difficult to reconcile with the cases that have @xmath52 , in which the region responsible for the @xmath1-ray emission is relatively large ( 5@xmath3810@xmath42 cm ) and the doppler factor small ( @xmath66 = 4 ) .",
    "reducing the size of the emitting region in these two cases should lead to an increase of the compactness of the region and thus of the corresponding @xmath1ray opacity .",
    "this is another indication in favour of a relatively small viewing angle .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that pks 0521@xmath036 is an agn seen at @xmath35 @xmath415@xmath3 and its ` aligned ' counterpart is a blazar belonging to a population of synchrotron - dominated objects .",
    "we investigated the properties of pks 0521@xmath036 , an agn with uncertain classification .",
    "we report results on multiwavelength observations of this source obtained from radio through @xmath1 rays by sma , umrao , vla , _ swift _ and _ fermi_-lat , mostly during 2008 august2012 august . in addition",
    "archival _ xmm  newton _ , _ chandra _ , and vlba observations were analyzed .",
    "the historical classification of this source as a bl lac object is in contrast with the broad emission lines observed in optical and uv , with ew larger than 5  ( rest - frame ) .",
    "the presence of broad emission lines may suggest a classification as an fsrq , but the radio spectrum below 1.4 ghz is not flat ( @xmath67 0.7 ) . the radio spectral shape and",
    "the optical emission lines indicate a possible classification as an intermediate object between blrg and ssrq . on pc - scales pks",
    "0521@xmath036 shows a one - sided jet with a brightness distribution along the axis decreasing down to the noise level and then rising in an extended , stationary feature at nearly 30 pc .",
    "this is similar to what was observed in m87 and 3c 120 , two @xmath1-ray emitting misaligned agn . the core dominance estimated for pks 0521@xmath036 is similar to those of the @xmath1-ray emitting ssrq 3c 380 and 3c 207 and blrg 3c 111 , suggesting an intermediate viewing angle with respect to the observer .",
    "the fit of the _ xmm  newton _ epic pn spectrum confirmed the presence of a contribution of the thermal component identified by @xcite in the _ chandra _ image as a diffuse halo around the agn .",
    "no significant fe k@xmath68 emission was detected in the _ xmm  newton _ spectrum .",
    "this seems to disagree with the possible classification of pks 0521@xmath036 as a blrg , although a smaller viewing angle with respect to the other blrg may lead to a significant increase of the jet component that overwhelms the fe k@xmath68 line in this object ( similarly to the case of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn j0948@xmath690022 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the contemporaneous flux increase observed from optical to @xmath1 rays during 2010 june suggests the identification of the @xmath1-ray source with pks 0521@xmath036 .",
    "the 230 ghz light curve showed an increase of activity peaking on 2011 january . a delay of @xmath46 months between the emission at mm and @xmath1 rays is unlikely , suggesting that different parts of the jet are responsible for those activities .",
    "however , we can not rule out that a mm peak contemporaneous to the @xmath1-ray one was missed due to the lack of observations at 230 ghz in 2010 may  june",
    ". the average @xmath1-ray photon index of the source ( @xmath23 = 2.45 @xmath70 0.02 ) is similar to the average value observed for fsrq as well as for the fr ii radio galaxies ( in particular the ssrq ) .",
    "moreover , the average apparent isotropic luminosity of the source ( l@xmath71 = 5.2 @xmath3810@xmath72 erg s@xmath12 ) is in agreement with the values observed for bl lacs and radio galaxies .",
    "however , the lower luminosity with respect to ssrq may be due to the close proximity of the source .",
    "thus , taking into account its low redshift , the @xmath1-ray properties of pks 0521@xmath036 are compatible with those observed in ssrq and blrg . in this context the strong flaring activity detected from this source by _",
    "fermi_-lat starting from 2010 june , with daily peak flux of 12@xmath3810@xmath73 ph @xmath74 s@xmath12 , is very intriguing .",
    "we discuss the @xmath1-ray emission of this source in the framework of the ` spine - layer ' scenario , with a fast spine surrounded by a slower layer , like in the case of the radio galaxy ngc 1275 @xcite .",
    "we compare the sed of the flaring state ( 2010 june ) with that of a low activity state ( 2010 february - march ) .",
    "we present three alternative models , corresponding to three different choices of the viewing angles @xmath2 = 6@xmath3 , 15@xmath3 , and 20@xmath3 . for the case with @xmath2",
    "= 6@xmath3 and 15@xmath3 we obtain a good fit . according to the unification scheme for radio galaxies and blazars ,",
    "reporting the sed obtained with @xmath2 = 15@xmath3 as recorded by an observer at @xmath2 = 4@xmath3 , this sed would correspond to that of the ` aligned ' counterpart of the radio galaxy .",
    "on the contrary , the resulting sed is strongly unbalanced toward the synchrotron luminosity ( by a factor of @xmath64 ) , at odds with the typical blazar sed .",
    "this suggests that a viewing angle between 6@xmath3 and 15@xmath3 is preferred .",
    "in the spine - layer scenario proposed here the rapid variability observed during @xmath1-ray flares favours a relatively small angle .",
