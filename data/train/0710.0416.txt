    "the comprehensive formulation for loop quantum cosmology ( lqc , see @xcite for a review ) in the spatially flat and isotropic model has been constructed in detail @xcite , giving a conceptual framework and a solid foundation to analyze the physical issues of the quantum theory . with a massless scalar field serving as the _ emergent time _",
    ", the investigation shows that the quantum evolution is _ deterministic across the deep planck regime _ and in the backward evolution of the states which are semiclassical at late times , _ the big bang is replaced by a big bounce_.    in the original construction ( called `` @xmath0-scheme '' ) of @xcite , the discreteness variable introduced to impose the fundamental discreteness of quantum geometry is taken to be constant ( referred to as @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , it has been shown that this prescription leads to the wrong semiclassical behavior that , in particular , the critical value of matter density at which the big bounce takes place can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the scalar field momentum @xmath1 . to fix this problem ,",
    "the construction was further improved by a more sophisticated implementation of the underlying physical ideas of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) with the discreteness variable ( referred to as @xmath2 ) varying adaptively @xcite . in this",
    "improved dynamics ( called `` @xmath2-scheme '' ) , the big bounce occurs precisely when the matter density enters the planck regime , regardless of the value of @xmath1 . this construction was also extended to @xmath3 and @xmath4 robertson - walker models @xcite .    in order to further develop this formulation and",
    "extend its domain of validity , based on the same principles of @xcite , both the precursor strategy ( @xmath0-scheme ) and the improved strategy ( @xmath2-scheme ) were applied and reconstructed for the bianchi i model to include anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the analytical investigation shows that the state in the kinematical hilbert space associated with the classical singularity is _ completely decoupled _ in the difference evolution equation , indicating that the classical singularity is resolved in the quantum evolution and the big bounce may take place when any of the area scales undergoes the vanishing behavior .",
    "while a thorough numerical investigation for @xcite remains to be done to draw the definite conclusion for the details of the quantum evolution in the bianchi i model , the effective dynamics with lqc discreteness corrections was first studied in @xcite using @xmath5-scheme for the vacuum solution and the @xmath2-scheme effective dynamics has also been done in @xcite for the case with a massless scalar field and in @xcite with the inclusion of generic matters .",
    "not only do the results at the level of effective dynamics agree with the anticipations in @xcite but more intuitive pictures are also obtained in the semiclassical approach , giving insights into how and why the big bounces take place .    because of the variety of bianchi i models , extending the improved scheme is slightly ambiguous as a few strategies are possible . among them",
    ", two schemes are of particular interest ( referred to as `` @xmath2-scheme '' and `` @xmath6-scheme '' in this paper ) .",
    "the @xmath2-scheme is suggested in @xcite and used in @xcite , while the @xmath6-scheme is disfavored by @xcite and only mentioned briefly in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "it is later realized that the virtues of @xmath6-scheme might have been overlooked and we should not dismiss either of them prematurely in favor of the other before more physics is understood , as either scheme has both advantageous and disadvantageous features .",
    "to better understand the difference of their phenomenological ramifications , this paper presents the details of effective dynamics for the bianchi i model with a massless scalar field in both @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes .",
    "the investigation shows that in both schemes the big bang singularity is replaced by the big bounces , which take place _ up to three times , once in each diagonal direction_. however , @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes give different evolutions , distinct from each other not only in detail but also qualitatively .",
    "for instance , the indication of the occurrence of big bounces is the matter density @xmath7 in @xmath6-scheme while it is the `` directional density '' @xmath8 in @xmath2-scheme .",
    "furthermore , in the different schemes , the big bounces conjoin the different pairs ( `` antipodal '' pair _ vs _ `` conjugate '' pair ) of classical solutions on the two asymptotic sides of classical regime .    in the hamiltonian framework , we have to restrict the spatial integration to a finite sized cell @xmath9 to make the hamiltonian finite .",
    "this prescription raises the question whether the resulting dynamics is independent of the choice of @xmath9 .",
    "this issue is very subtle and has caused a great deal of confusion because the dependence on @xmath9 of the ashtekar variables is rather obscure . in order to elucidate the subtleties , the classical dynamics is carefully studied both in metric variables and in ashtekar variables ; the precise physical meanings of ashtekar variables are then obtained .",
    "with the subtleties clarified , it can be shown that the effective dynamics in @xmath6-scheme is completely independent of the choice of @xmath9 as is the classical dynamics , while the effective dynamics in @xmath2-scheme in fact reacts to the macroscopic scales introduced by the boundary conditions of @xmath9 .",
    "this is an important difference between these two schemes .",
    "in addition to the issues related to the dependence on @xmath9 , the effective dynamics in both schemes also reveals other interesting symmetries of scaling , which are reminiscent of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is also suggested that the fundamental scale ( area gap ) imposed for the spatial geometry may gives rise to a fundamental scale in temporal measurement .",
    "these observations could simply be technical artifacts but encourage further investigations for more sophisticated models to tell their profundity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : classical dynamics ] , the classical dynamics of the bianchi i cosmology with a massless scalar source is solved in hamiltonian formalism in terms of both metric variables and ashtekar variables .",

    "while the @xmath6-scheme has the advantage that its effective dynamics is independent of @xmath9 , the full theory of lqc based on @xmath6-scheme is difficult to construct .",
    "both @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes have desirable merits and it is still disputable which one is more faithful implementation of the underlying physics of quantum geometry .",
    "in addition to the symmetry related to the choice of @xmath9 , both schemes admit additional symmetries of scaling , which are reminiscent of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics , featuring the ideas of real rods and clocks . furthermore , the symmetry involving the barbero - immirzi parameter is suggestive that the fundamental scale ( area gap ) in spatial geometry may give rise to a fundamental scale in temporal measurement .",
    "these symmetries however break down in the construction for the full theory of lqc .",
    "a few possible extensions following the treatment of this paper seem to be within reach .",
    "first , as this paper focuses specifically on the model with a massless scalar field , it should be straightforward ( with necessary approximation ) to extend the results to the models with inclusion of generic matters , which will fulfill the investigation in @xcite for the @xmath6-scheme .",
    "another extension involves the inclusion of nontrivial potentials for the scalar field . in both extensions ,",
    "most of the observations we obtained here are to be expected and the investigations in broader context would further support or oppose some of our speculations .",
    "second , it would be instructive to compare the results of this paper with the perturbative treatment of anisotropies , since it has been suggested that the big bang singularity is not resolved if anisotropies are treated as perturbations of an isotropic background @xcite .",
    "incorporation of inhomogeneities , on the other hand , will be substantially more difficult . in order to determine whether @xmath2- or @xmath6-scheme is more physically sensible",
    ", we have to incorporate inhomogeneities at least approximately or perturbatively in the background of bianchi i type . the perturbative treatment such as developed in @xcite or the strong gravity approximation proposed in @xcite might be useful for this purpose .",
    "finally , the results in principle could be extended to the bianchi ix model . since bianchi ix model , along with bianchi i model , plays a pivotal role for the infinite fragmentation of the homogeneous patches close to the singularity in the bkl scenario , the analysis may provide hints to how the loop quantum effects resolve the classical singularities in generic situations and in return it may help arbitrate the tension between @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes for the bianchi i model .",
    "the author is grateful for the valuable discussions with abhay ashtekar , martin bojowald , golam hossain , kevin vandersloot and especially tomasz pawlowski and parampreet singh , who helped clarify confusions and inspired important ideas .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nsf grant phy-0456913 .",
    "one of the virtues of the improved strategy ( @xmath2-scheme ) in the isotropic model is to fix the serious drawback in the old precursor strategy ( @xmath0-scheme ) that the critical value of the matter density at which the bounce occurs can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the momentum @xmath1 , thereby leading to wrong semiclassical behavior .    in the bianchi i model , either the directional densities @xmath8 ( in @xmath2-scheme ) or the matter density @xmath7 ( in @xmath6-scheme ) plays the same role as @xmath7 does in the isotropic case .",
    "having learned from the isotropic case , we expect that the critical values of @xmath8 or @xmath7 at which the bounces occur can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the momentum @xmath1 in @xmath153-scheme but is independent of @xmath1 in @xmath2- or @xmath6-scheme .",

    ", we have [ eqn : qm0 dpc / dt ] = 0 , which gives [ eqn : qm0 pc ] p_i = 8gk_i . taking ( [ eqn : qm0 pc ] ) into ( [ eqn : qm0 eom 5 ] ) gives the same constraints on the constant parameters as in ( [ eqn : k ] ) .    substituting ( [ eqn : qm0 pc ] ) into ( [ eqn : qm0 eom 4 ] ) yields [ eqn : qm0 diff eq 1 ] = 8 g ( ^o_1c_1)(k_2+k_3 ) . by ( [ eqn : qm0 eom 2 ] ) and @xmath156 , ( [ eqn : qm0 diff eq 1 ] ) leads to [ eqn : qm0 diff eq 2 ] = ( ) ^1/2 , which gives the bouncing solutions with the behaviors similar to those given by ( [ eqn : qm diff eq 2 ] ) except that the critical value of @xmath8 at which the big bounce takes place is given by ^_o_i , crit:= ^3/2 , which can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the value of @xmath1 .",
    "as a result , @xmath0-scheme gives wrong semiclassical behavior and should be improved by @xmath2- or @xmath6-scheme to fix this problem .",
    "in this appendix , we give a heuristic argument for the prescription given by ( [ eqn : c to sin ] ) , starting from the hamiltonian constraint of lqg .",
    "the motivations for both @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes are addressed in detail .",
    "the advantages and drawbacks of both schemes are also remarked .",
    "the gravitational part of the classical hamiltonian constraint in the full theory of lqg is given by [ eqn : hamiltonian full ] h_grav&=&d^3x n e^-1 \\{_i^jkf^i_ab^a_j^b_k + & & -2(1+^2)k_[a^ik_b]^j^a_i^b_j } + & = & -d^3x n e^-1 _ i^jkf^i_ab^a_j^b_k , where @xmath157 and in the last line we exploit the fact that for homogeneous and spatially flat models the two terms inside the curly bracket are proportional to each other ( because @xmath158 as the spatial slice is flat and @xmath159 as it is homogeneous ) .",
    "furthermore , the lapse @xmath160 can be assumed to be constant because of homogeneity and we set @xmath161 .    when applied to bianchi i models , the integral",
    "is restricted to a finite sized cell @xmath9 as prescribed by ( [ eqn : finite cell ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we should also adopt the replacement rules ( [ eqn : replacement rule1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : replacement rule2 ] ) .",
    "this procedure gives h_grav&=&-_vd^3x e^-1v_o^-2v^-2 + & & ( _ i^jk^i_lma_p^la_q^me^p_je^q_k ) + & = & -_vd^3x e^-1v_o^-2v^-2 + & & ( _ 2_3_2_3 + ) + & = & - and e^2&=&||=v^-3|(e^j_i^o e^a_j)| + & = & v^-3|| = v^-2|p_1p_2p_3| . consequently , we have [ eqn : h grav ] h_grav= - , which is exactly the same as @xmath162 given in ( [ eqn : cl hamiltonian ] )",
    ".    when the quantization is performed in the context of lqc , there are two loop quantum corrections .",
    "the first is the modification on the inverse triad operator @xmath163 as indicated in ( [ eqn : f(p_i ) ] ) , which is negligible and ignored in this paper .",
    "the second is due to the fact that the connections @xmath164 ( or @xmath60 ) do not exist and should be replaced with holonomies ( or exponentials of @xmath60 ) .    following the standard techniques in gauge theories ,",
    "the curvature component @xmath165 can be expressed in terms of holonomies ( i.e. wilson loops ) .",
    "given a small surface @xmath166 center in @xmath167 , stokes theorem allows us to write the curvature component as [ eqn : curvature ] _",
    "i f^i_ab()&&__i f^i_cd dx^cdx^d + & & , where @xmath168 are the pauli matrices ; @xmath169 is the boundary loop of @xmath166 ; and the _ coordinate _ area of @xmath166 projected in `` @xmath170-direction '' is given by ^_ab=_dx^adx^b .",
    "this is a good approximation provided @xmath171 is small enough and in fact it becomes exact in the continuous limit @xmath172 .    for the bianchi i model ,",
    "we choose @xmath173 to be a small rectangular surface parallel to the @xmath174-@xmath175 plane .",
    "the _ coordinate _ lengthes of the edges of @xmath166 are denoted as @xmath176 and @xmath177 and accordingly the _ coordinate _ area is given by @xmath178 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) . applying ( [ eqn : replacement rule2 ] ) and noting that @xmath179 gives [ eqn : fab ] f^i_abf^i_jk:=_ijk(l_jl_k)^-1c_jc_k",
    ", we read off from ( [ eqn : curvature ] ) that [ eqn : fjk ] f^i_jk - , where @xmath180 is any permutation of @xmath181 and the holonomy along the edges of @xmath182 is : h__jk^(|_j,|_k):=h_j^(|_j)h_k^(|_k ) ( h_j^(|_j))^-1(h_k^(|_k))^-1 with @xmath183 being the holonomy along the individual edge : h_i^(|_i)&:=&p(_0^|_i l_i_ia_a^i dx^a ) ( |_i c_i_i ) + & = & ( ) + 2()_i , which follows [ eqn : trace ] tr=-(|_jc_j)(|_kc_k ) .",
    "putting ( [ eqn : fab ] ) , ( [ eqn : fjk ] ) and ( [ eqn : trace ] ) altogether , we then have c_jc_k , which is exactly the prescription used in ( [ eqn : c to sin ] ) .",
    "if @xmath182 shrinks to a point , this gives the continuous limit @xmath184 and we recover the classical hamiltonian constraint in ( [ eqn : h grav ] ) .",
    "however , the very feature of lgc is that the continuous limit does not exist and the failure of the limit to exist is intimately related with the underlying quantum geometry of lqg , where eigenvalues of the area operator are _",
    "discrete_. in lqc , to implement the discreteness as imprint from the full theory of lqg , we have to set @xmath66 to be finite .",
    "the question now is : what values should @xmath66 be set to faithfully reflect the fundamental discreteness of quantum geometry ?",
    "two strategies ( @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes ) are discussed below .",
    "since the eigenvalue spectrum of the area operator has an _ area gap _ @xmath143 , to impose the discreteness , it is straightforward to set the _ physical _ area of @xmath182 to be @xmath143 ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5].a ) ; i.e. a_ja_k^_jk&=&a_ja_k|_j|_kl_jl_k + & = & |_ijkp_i||_j|_k= , which gives the `` @xmath6-scheme '' in ( [ eqn : mubar ] ) .",
    "however , a closer consideration seems to suggest that equating the physical area of @xmath182 to @xmath143 might not be completely sensible .",
    "recall that the validity of ( [ eqn : curvature ] ) is based on stokes theorem , which does _ not _ invoke the metric of the surface @xmath166 at all .",
    "the smallness of @xmath166 to ensure good approximation of ( [ eqn : curvature ] ) does not directly refer to metric smallness , either .",
    "furthermore , if we think of the picture of spin networks in lqg , what associated with the physical areas are links ( holonomies ) of the spin network ; the area enclosed by the loop of holonomy links is irrelevant !",
    "therefore , back to lqc , instead of shrinking the area of @xmath182 , we should associate each _ edge _ of @xmath182 with an area and then shrink the associated areas to @xmath143 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5].b . )",
    "the edge of @xmath182 in @xmath174-direction is of _ coordinate _ length @xmath185 , with which , most naturally , we associate a rectangle @xmath186 parallel to @xmath80-@xmath175 plane of _ coordinate _ lengths @xmath187 and @xmath188 on its edges .",
    "( that is , the ratio of the edge of @xmath186 to the edge of @xmath9 in the @xmath80/@xmath175-direction is set to be the same as the ratio of the edge of @xmath182 to the edge of @xmath9 in the @xmath174-direction . )",
    "we then set the _",
    "physical _ area of @xmath186 to @xmath143 ; i.e. a_ia_k|_j^2l_il_k=|_j^2|p_j|= , which gives the `` @xmath2-scheme '' in ( [ eqn : mubar ] ) .",
    "[ note that in both pictures of @xmath6- and @xmath2-schemes , if we rather set the _ coordinate _ area of @xmath182 or @xmath186 to be @xmath143 , we end up with constant @xmath66 .",
    "this is the `` @xmath0-scheme '' used in the precursor strategy .",
    "the wrong semiclassical behavior of the @xmath0-scheme originates from the problem that the _ coordinate _ area ( both of @xmath182 and of @xmath189 ) is not totally physically relevant . ]    in the full theory of lqg , when the hamiltonian acts on an spin network state , it adds a new link of spin-@xmath190 and the coloring of the links on which the new link is attached is increased or decreased by @xmath190 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6].a - b ) .",
    "the resulting spin network state is equivalent to the original state superimposed with a triangular loop of spin-@xmath190 links ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6].c ) .",
    "this triangular loop is essentially the wilson loop discussed above . from this perspective , the @xmath6-scheme can be understood as associating the area in pink in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6].d with @xmath143 , whereas the @xmath2-scheme as associating the area in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6].e with @xmath143 . in the context of spin network states , the coloring of a link corresponds to the area of the surface to which the link penetrates and the smallest coloring spin-@xmath190 gives rise to the _ area gap _ @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , it is in this sense that @xmath2-scheme is a more direct implementation of the underlying discreteness of quantum geometry than @xmath6-scheme .",
    "furthermore , in the full quantum theory of lqc , @xmath2-scheme has the important virtue that we can define the affine variables @xmath191 via : = 4_pl^2|_i such that hamiltonian constraint of the full quantum theory gives the evolution as a difference equation in terms of @xmath191 and therefore the methodology used for the isotropic lqc can be easily applied @xcite .",
    "this strategy fails in @xmath6-scheme since 0 and hence the corresponding affine variables do not exist .",
    "this makes it difficult to construct the full quantum theory of bianchi i lqc in @xmath6-scheme .    on the other hand , as studied in section  [ sec : effective dynamics ] , @xmath6-scheme has the advantage over @xmath2-scheme that the effective dynamics in @xmath6-scheme is independent of the choice of @xmath9 . the difference for this point between @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes",
    "can be understood , heuristically but instructively , by estimating the quantity @xmath192 with the classical formulae ; that is , plugging ( [ eqn : c and hi ] ) for @xmath60 , we have [ eqn : mubar c ]    [ eqn : mubar c ] |_ic_i&&^1/2h_i .",
    "since the quantity @xmath192 indicates how significant the quantum corrections are ( quantum corrections are negligible if @xmath193 ) , ( [ eqn : mubar c ] ) tells that in @xmath2-scheme , the place at which the quantum effects become appreciable is tied up with not only the hubble rates @xmath194 but also the physical geometry of @xmath9 .",
    "by contrast , ( [ eqn : mubar c ] ) shows that the different choice of @xmath9 is irrelevant in @xmath6-scheme .    in the language of @xcite",
    ", @xmath2-scheme corresponds to a lattice refinement model whereby the number of vertices is proportional to the transverse area .",
    "a stability analysis suggests that @xmath2-scheme leads to an unstable difference equation in the full theory of lqc and thus may not represent a good quantization scheme .",
    "both @xmath2- and @xmath6-schemes have desirable and undesirable features of their own . in order to understood them more deeply , in the main text we study both schemes and their ramifications at the level of effective dynamics ."
