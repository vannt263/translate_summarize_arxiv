    "for @xmath0 , let @xmath1 denote the infinite sector of opening @xmath2 , @xmath21 in the present paper , we are interested in the spectral properties of the associated robin laplacian , to be denoted @xmath4 , which is defined as follows : for @xmath9 , the operator @xmath4 acts in @xmath5 as @xmath22 on the functions @xmath23 satisfying the boundary condition @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the outer unit normal .",
    "more precisely , @xmath26 is defined as the unique self - adjoint operator in @xmath5 corresponding to the quadratic form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the one - dimensional hausdorff measure .    during the last years",
    ", the spectral analysis of robin laplacians attracted a considerable attention .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the spectral properties of such operators are sensible to the regularity of the boundary , and the case of smooth domains has been studied in detail  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "only partial results are available for domains with a non - smooth boundary , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of the above operator @xmath4 has several interesting aspects from the point of view of the existing results .",
    "first , it can be viewed as the simplest non - smooth domain in two dimensions and depending in an explicit way of the single geometric parameter @xmath10 .",
    "second , its spectral properties play an important role in the study of more general non - smooth domains in the strong coupling limit , see @xcite , as the sectors @xmath1 exhaust the whole family of possible tangent cones to the boundary in two dimensions .",
    "third , the domain @xmath1 and its boundary are non - compact , which may potentially lead to quite unusual spectral properties , such as the presence of an infinite discrete spectrum , and the respective studies in higher dimensions @xcite do not extend directly to the planar case : we will see below that the results are actually quite different .",
    "in fact , the only spectral result on @xmath4 available in the existing literature is as follows , see @xcite : @xmath29 and for @xmath30 the value indicated is an eigenvalue with an explicitly known eigenfunction @xmath31 . the aim of the present work is to provide a more detailed spectral analysis .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "first , as the essential spectrum of @xmath4 does not depend on the angle @xmath10 and equals @xmath11 , see theorem  [ spec ] , it follows from that the discrete spectrum is non - empty if and only if @xmath30 , i.e. if and only if the sector is strictly smaller than the half - plane . in theorem  [ thm31 ]",
    "we show that the discrete spectrum is always finite , which is a non - trivial result due to the non - compactness of the boundary . in subsection  [ monotone ]",
    "we obtain more detailed results : in theorem  [ increase ] we show that each individual eigenvalue is a strictly increasing continuous function of the angle @xmath10 and , moreover , that there is just one discrete eigenvalue for @xmath13 , see theorem  [ thmpi6 ] . in section  [ small1 ]",
    "we discuss the behavior of the discrete eigenvalues for small @xmath10 .",
    "we show that the @xmath17th eigenvalue @xmath18 behaves as @xmath32 see corollary  [ corol43 ] , and , moreover , admits an asymptotic expansion up to any order with respect to the powers of @xmath20 , see theorem  [ full ] .",
    "the number of discrete eigenvalues becomes arbitrary large and is minorated by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , as @xmath10 approaches @xmath14 , see corollary  [ cor42 ] . in theorem  [ agmon ]",
    "we show that the associated eigenfunctions are localized , in a suitable sense , near the vertex .",
    "our proofs are mostly variational and based on the min - max characterization of the essential spectrum and the eigenvalues .",
    "the proof of the finiteness of the discrete spectrum uses an idea proposed in @xcite for a different operator involving a similar geometry , while the continuity and the monotonicity of the eigenvalues are established using a suitable change of variables .",
    "the asymptotics for small @xmath10 is based on the well - known born - oppenheimer strategy @xcite and , similar to various problems involving small parameters @xcite , on a reduction to a one - dimensional effective operator , which in our case acts in @xmath33 as @xmath34 with a suitable boundary condition at the origin , while an additional work is required due to the singularity of the potential .",
    "we remark that the use of an improved hardy inequality @xcite allows one to perform the reduction in a rather direct way , without any preliminary localization argument for the associated eigenfunctions .",
    "the properties of the eigenfunctions are studied with the help of the standard agmon - type approach using a suitable decomposition of the domain .",
    "we remark that in the present paper we are not discussing the ( non-)existence of eigenvalues embedded into the continuous spectrum .",
    "some partial information can be easily obtained , for example , the recent rellich - type result @xcite implies the absence of positive embedded eigenvalues for @xmath35 , but a specific separate study is needed in order to cover all possible cases .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "for @xmath9 denote by @xmath36 the self - adjoint operator acting in @xmath33 by @xmath37 one easily checks that @xmath38 and that the unique eigenvalue is @xmath39 with @xmath40 the associated eigenfunction .",

    "as @xmath91 is continuous , the result follows .",
    "recall first the min - max principle giving a variational characterization of eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath93 be a self - adjoint operator acting in a hilbert space @xmath94 of infinite dimension .",

    "let @xmath103 and @xmath104 be a dense subset of the hilbert space @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath105 be the @xmath17th _ rayleigh quotient _ of @xmath93 , which is defined by @xmath106 then one and only one of the following assertions is true :    1 .",
    "@xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "2 .   @xmath109 and @xmath110 for all @xmath111 .    in order to use the min - max principle for the robin laplacians we need the following density result , which is quite standard ( see appendix  [ appa ] for the proof )",
    ".    [ density ] the set @xmath112 is dense in @xmath113 .",
    "we remark that most of the subsequent constructions are heavily based on estimates for the rayleigh quotients of various operators .",
