    "bps monopoles for the @xmath0 yang  mills  higgs gauge theory have been studied for over twenty years , using a number of different approaches .",
    "twistor methods , relating the solutions of the integrable differential equations of the model to holomorphic vector bundles over a so - called twistor space , were first introduced by ward , adapting previous work on the self - duality equations for the pure yang  mills theory on @xmath1 .",
    "they enabled solutions of magnetic charge @xmath2 to be constructed for the first time @xcite .",
    "a twistor approach intrinsic to the geometry of @xmath3 was developed later by hitchin in @xcite and  @xcite . in his formulation",
    ", a monopole is associated to a spectral curve , a compact complex curve in @xmath4 , the total space of the holomorphic tangent bundle of @xmath5 , satisfying a number of conditions which were stated in @xcite .",
    "based on this approach , new solutions have been constructed and new characterisations of monopoles developed ; we refer to @xcite for a brief overview .",
    "the ( reduced ) moduli space @xmath6 of gauge - inequivalent bps monopoles of a given charge @xmath7 is a @xmath8-dimensional manifold , which has been described in several ways .",
    "if we adopt the twistor formulation in terms of spectral curves , it can be characterised as the space of complex curves in @xmath4 satisfying a number of transcendental constraints . for the case where the curve is nonsingular , ercolani and",
    "sinha attempted to formulate these constraints explicitly in  @xcite ; they followed essentially the method of hurtubise in  @xcite , who achieved a satisfactory description of  @xmath9 .",
    "their approach leads to a method of determining constraints on spectral curves by analysing objects of the function theory obtained on them .",
    "these constraints parallel the corrigan ",
    "goddard conditions @xcite for constructing @xmath0 monopoles , and we shall clarify how they relate to each other .    this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the relevant aspects of the twistor approach for monopoles in section  [ twistor ] , in order to fix the notation . in section  [ ercsin ]",
    ", we review the method of ercolani and sinha , and present a new version ( [ oures ] ) of their constraint equations which involves a special 1-cycle @xmath10 on the spectral curve . the corrigan ",
    "goddard conditions were originally formulated in terms of integrals around the equator of @xmath5 , but we show in section  [ corgod ] how to interpret them equivalently as integrals on the spectral curve .",
    "moreover , we establish that the conditions in the two methods agree except for one detail : the corrigan ",
    "goddard approach enforces @xmath10 to be of a special sort , namely a combination of lifts of the equator of @xmath5 to the spectral curve . in section  [ 4hedral ] ,",
    "we apply the ercolani  sinha method to compute the spectral curve of the tetrahedral 3-monopole discussed in @xcite .",
    "thereby , the corresponding 1-cycle @xmath10 is determined and the result shows that the corrigan ",
    "goddard assumption about @xmath10 is too restrictive in general ; we also consider the action of the tetrahedral group @xmath11 on the homology of the spectral curve and show that it leaves @xmath10 invariant",
    ". finally , we present some concluding remarks in section  [ cnclsn ] .",
    "magnetic bps monopoles with gauge group @xmath0 are defined as gauge equivalence classes of solutions @xmath12 to the bogomolnyequations in @xmath3 @xmath13 satisfying boundary conditions ( see @xcite ) that ensure finiteness of the energy functional ; here @xmath14 is a connection 1-form ( with covariant derivative @xmath15 and curvature 2-form @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 ( the higgs field ) a function , both taking values in @xmath18 .",
    "such solutions can be interpreted as particle - like solitons carrying discrete magnetic charge .",
    "they are associated with an integer @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 according to the sign in equation ( [ bgmln ] ) ) , which corresponds to the magnetic charge of the field configuration in suitable units and classifies the solutions homotopically ; we take @xmath21 throughout . the bianchi identity together with ( [ bgmln ] ) imply that bps monopoles are also static classical solutions of the corresponding yang  mills ",
    "higgs theory in the bps limit , in which the higgs potential is set to zero , and they correspond exactly to the minima of the energy functional .    the equations ( [ bgmln ] ) are integrable and their solutions can be studied using methods of complex algebraic geometry .",
    "this was formulated by hitchin in @xcite as follows .",
    "the space @xmath22 of oriented geodesics ( straight lines ) of @xmath3 is a 4-dimensional manifold  a point on it can be specified by a pair of vectors @xmath23 , where @xmath24 has unit length and defines the orientation of the line , while @xmath25 gives the position of the point on the line closest to the origin and is thus orthogonal to @xmath24 .",
    "this manifold admits a natural integrable almost complex structure , given at each point @xmath26 by taking the cross product with @xmath24 of each of the pair of vectors representing a tangent vector .",
    "it turns out that @xmath22 , endowed with this complex structure , is isomorphic as a complex surface to the total space @xmath4 of the holomorphic tangent bundle to the riemann sphere .",
    "the isomorphism takes @xmath24 to the corresponding point in @xmath27 and @xmath25 to the obvious complex coordinate on the fibre .",
    "we will consider the standard affine pieces @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath5 , identifying the affine coordinate @xmath30 on @xmath28 with the stereographic projection from the south pole and letting @xmath31 denote the corresponding coordinate on the fibre ; thus a tangent vector @xmath32 is assigned the pair @xmath33 .",
    "we let @xmath34 be the natural projection @xmath35 , given in these coordinates by @xmath36 , and denote again by @xmath28 , @xmath29 the pre - images under @xmath34 of the affine pieces of @xmath5 .    in the literature",
    ", @xmath22 is often called mini - twistor space .",
    "it admits a real structure @xmath37 , which is the anti - holomorphic involution corresponding to the reversal of direction of oriented lines in @xmath3 ; it obviously has no fixed points . in terms of our coordinates",
    ", it can be seen to be given by @xmath38 the group @xmath39 of rotations in @xmath3 induces an action on @xmath22 , which can be easily described in the coordinates @xmath33 in terms of the corresponding @xmath40 transformations : the matrix @xmath41 acts on the affine coordinate @xmath30 as @xmath42 and this corresponds to a rotation by @xmath43 around the direction @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; @xmath31 transforms by multiplication by the derivative of ( [ psu2 ] ) , @xmath49 since it is the fibre coordinate of @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear from the definitions that the action of @xmath39 commutes with the @xmath50 action generated by @xmath51 .    for each @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we define a holomorphic line bundle @xmath54 on @xmath22 through the transition function @xmath55 with respect to the trivialising cover @xmath56 of @xmath22 ; this definition is independent of the stereographic projection used on @xmath5 .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "these line bundles play a rle in the formulation of the twistor correspondence for monopoles , which we now describe . to a monopole @xmath12 we associate the complex vector bundle @xmath61 ,",
    "whose fibre at an oriented line @xmath62 is the complex 2-dimensional space of solutions @xmath63 to the equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the restriction of @xmath15 to @xmath66 .",
    "the bogomolny   equation ( [ bgmln ] ) implies that @xmath67 is holomorphic ; it can be regarded as an extension @xmath68 of the line subbundles @xmath69 of solutions decaying exponentially as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the natural coordinate on @xmath66 .",
    "it can be shown that , for any monopole of charge @xmath7 , @xmath72 is isomorphic to @xmath73 ; different monopoles correspond to different extensions @xmath67 .",
    "given the two short exact sequences ( [ ext ] ) , we consider the composite morphism @xmath74 , which defines a holomorphic section @xmath75 of the line bundle @xmath76 .",
    "it will determine a compact curve @xmath77 , which is given in our coordinates by an equation @xmath78 where each @xmath79 is a complex polynomial of degree not exceeding @xmath80 .",
    "notice that the real structure @xmath51 induces antiholomorphic morphisms @xmath81 and thus restricts to a real structure on @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that the polynomials @xmath79 in equation ( [ speccv ] ) must satisfy the reality conditions @xmath83 it can be shown that the three independent real coefficients of @xmath84 may be interpreted as giving the center @xmath85 of the monopole in @xmath3 , @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and are thus trivial moduli in the solution , related to the translational symmetry of ( [ bgmln ] ) . in the following , we shall only consider centred monopoles ; these are defined as having the origin as center and thus have @xmath88 .    in @xcite",
    ", hitchin proved that , conversely , any compact real curve @xmath82 of the linear system @xmath89 on @xmath22 for which @xmath90 is trivial determines a charge @xmath7 monopole , which will be smooth if the additional condition @xmath91 holds for @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath82 is called the spectral curve of the monopole and completely determines the gauge equivalence class of the field configuration .",
    "it encodes all the information about the monopole ; in particular , its genus @xmath93 is related to the magnetic charge @xmath7 by @xmath94 and every symmetry of @xmath82 is also a symmetry of the corresponding solution to  ( [ bgmln ] ) .",
    "in @xcite , ercolani and sinha rephrase the condition of triviality of the line bundle @xmath90 in terms of @xmath93 equations involving periods of 1-forms on the spectral curve @xmath82 . starting with these equations , which they call the `` quantisation conditions '' , they propose an algorithm for constructing monopoles in the case where the underlying spectral curve is nonsingular .",
    "we now review their argument .    recall that when @xmath82 is nonsingular the group @xmath95 of global holomorphic 1-forms on @xmath82 is a finite - dimensional @xmath96-vector space , whose dimension is the genus @xmath93 of @xmath82 .",
    "locally , these forms @xmath97 can be described , using the adjunction formula , as poincar residues of meromorphic 1-forms on @xmath22 with at most simple poles along @xmath82 . imposing global regularity , it is easy to show that they can be written in our coordinates as @xmath98 ( on @xmath99 and away from the branch points of @xmath100 ) , where each @xmath101 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath80 with arbitrary coefficients .",
    "it is clear from this formula that equation ( [ genus ] ) indeed holds .    from equation ( [ speccv ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that the spectral curve @xmath82 can be described as a @xmath7-sheeted branched cover of @xmath5 , with projection @xmath102 .",
    "the reality symmetry implies that the number of branch points is even and that they occur in antipodal pairs . to define the sheets of the cover , which we will label by integers @xmath103",
    ", we have to introduce appropriate branch cuts .",
    "we may start by choosing a great circle on the sphere passing through no branch points , and joining the branch points in one of the corresponding hemispheres by non - intersecting cuts ; then we apply the antipodal map to these to get further cuts joining the branch points on the other side of the great circle we have chosen . to ensure that each sheet is simply connected , we have to make one last cut , connecting the cuts introduced on the two hemispheres . for the spectral curves we shall consider below",
    ", one can argue that this last cut has trivial monodromy and is thus unnecessary ; in this situation , the reality structure maps cuts to cuts and can therefore be described in terms of the antipodal map together with an order two permutation of the sheets",
    ".    we will be interested in the local behaviour of certain meromorphic forms at the points of the fibre above @xmath104 , which we shall denote by @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and assume to be distinct ; this is no loss of generality since there is the freedom of rotating the monopole .",
    "consider the meromorphic function on @xmath82 defined by @xmath107 on @xmath99 ; it is easy to see that it has simple poles at the @xmath108 points of @xmath109 and is holomorphic elsewhere . in a neighbourhood of @xmath105 , @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the local solution of ( [ speccv ] ) on the @xmath112th sheet .",
    "given a global holomorphic 1-form @xmath97 , we introduce the notation @xmath113 for the coefficient of @xmath97 at the point @xmath105 in terms of the local coordinate @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath114    the triviality of the line bundle @xmath90 is equivalent to the existence of a nowhere vanishing holomorphic section @xmath115 ; with respect to the trivialisation of @xmath90 over the open sets @xmath99 and @xmath116 , @xmath115 is given by two nowhere vanishing holomorphic functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 on @xmath99 , @xmath116 respectively , satisfying @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "this implies that the meromorphic 1-forms @xmath121 ( : = @xmath122 ) and @xmath123 are related by @xmath124 on @xmath125 .",
    "notice that @xmath126 for any homology 1-cycle @xmath127 ; moreover , these integrals are nonzero in general , since the 1-forms @xmath128 do not have to be exact . from equations ( [ defrho ] ) and ( [ dlog ] )",
    ", we conclude that @xmath123 must have the local behaviour near @xmath105 @xmath129 in order for @xmath117 not to have an essential singularity at @xmath130 .",
    "it should be noted that the section @xmath115 is uniquely determined up to a multiplicative constant , since the quotient of @xmath115 by any other nowhere vanishing section of @xmath90 yields a global holomorphic function on the compact riemann surface @xmath82 .",
    "notice also that the modulus of this constant can be fixed by imposing the symmetry @xmath131 since the right - hand side has the regularity and nowhere vanishing properties of @xmath118 , and @xmath132 changes sign under pull - back by @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath133 be a canonical basis of @xmath134 , i.e. satisfying the orthonormality conditions @xmath135 for the intersection pairing .",
    "following ercolani and sinha , we apply the reciprocity law for differentials of the first and second kinds ( cf  @xcite , p.  241 ) to an arbitrary holomorphic 1-form @xmath97 and @xmath123 to get @xmath136 let @xmath137 and @xmath138 be the integers @xmath139 consistently with ( [ 2piiz ] ) , and let us define the 1-cycle @xmath140 then equation ( [ quant1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath141    the existence of @xmath142 satisfying ( [ quant2 ] ) is equivalent to the line bundle @xmath90 being trivial .",
    "unfortunately , the condition  ( [ smooth ] ) which would ensure smoothness can not be implemented directly in the ercolani ",
    "sinha approach if @xmath143 , but we can include a weaker statement in the analysis as follows . since for @xmath144 there is an inclusion @xmath145 given by tensoring with a section of @xmath146 , the condition @xmath147 is necessary for ( [ smooth ] ) to hold .",
    "now we can repeat the argument above to investigate the existence of global sections of @xmath148 , arriving at the same equation ( [ quant2 ] ) with @xmath149 replaced by  @xmath150 , and we can conclude that there will be no nontrivial global sections of @xmath148 for @xmath92 if and only if @xmath10 is primitive in @xmath151 .    we can still simplify the left - hand side of ( [ quant2 ] ) . consider a global holomorphic 1-form @xmath97 on @xmath82 , as given by ( [ adjunction ] ) . after defining the branch cuts ,",
    "we can write @xmath152 and so @xmath153 on sheet @xmath154 , @xmath155 and all the terms in the sum above vanish except one , @xmath156 we can use this to write the coefficient @xmath157 in ( [ defg ] ) for @xmath97 as @xmath158 so the left - hand side of ( [ quant2 ] ) takes the form @xmath159 this appears to be a very complicated expression , but we can simplify it considerably if we make use of the identity @xmath160 taking @xmath161 , we obtain @xmath162 and substitution in ( [ quant2 ] ) yields @xmath163 so our version of the ercolani",
    " sinha conditions amounts to the existence of a primitive 1-cycle @xmath10 such that equation ( [ oures ] ) is satisfied for every global holomorphic 1-form @xmath97 , where @xmath164 is the coefficient in ( [ adjunction ] ) for @xmath97 .    to prove ( [ niceid ] )",
    ", we first note that the cases @xmath165 follow from the @xmath166 case : a translation @xmath167 of all the @xmath168 s leaves the denominators in the sum invariant , @xmath169 so by expanding the binomials and collecting equal powers of @xmath170 we get the statement for all @xmath171 .",
    "the proof of the @xmath166 case by induction on @xmath7 is rather lengthy and we prefer to argue as follows . it is readily seen that the whole sum is symmetric under the action of the symmetric group @xmath172 permuting the @xmath168 s . reducing to a common fraction yields as denominator @xmath173 and this polynomial is completely antisymmetric under @xmath172 ; in fact , the space of antisymmetric polynomials in @xmath7 variables is generated by @xmath174 over the ring of symmetric polynomials .",
    "the numerator is then necessarily antisymmetric and a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath175 , which is also the degree of @xmath174 , so it has to be equal to @xmath174 times a constant .",
    "taking the asymptotic limit @xmath176 in the original sum , we conclude that this constant has to be 1 .",
    "it is convenient , when we come to investigate particular examples , to introduce bases for both the global holomorphic 1-forms and the homology 1-cycles on @xmath82 .",
    "an obvious basis @xmath177 for @xmath95 corresponds to taking monomials @xmath178 for the allowed powers @xmath179 and @xmath150 ( in lexicographical order of decreasing @xmath179 and increasing @xmath150 ) as numerators of ( [ adjunction ] ) , @xmath180 the condition ( [ oures ] ) for a general @xmath97 is then equivalent to the @xmath93 conditions @xmath181 let us also fix a canonical basis ( [ h1basis ] ) for @xmath151 .",
    "the ( @xmath182 ) period matrix for @xmath82 corresponding to the two choices of bases is then defined as usual by @xmath183 $ ] , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are square matrices with entries @xmath186 recalling ( [ esc ] ) , equation ( [ justleq1 ] ) can now be written as @xmath187    although the number of integers to be determined in ( [ exples ] ) is @xmath188 , they still have to satisfy constraints coming from the reality structure of @xmath82 .",
    "we prove below that these imply that @xmath10 is antisymmetric under the action of @xmath51 on the first homology group , @xmath189 this imposes @xmath93 linear constraints on the @xmath188 components of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath51 is anti - holomorphic , @xmath190 for any @xmath191 , and this shows that the matrix @xmath192 representing @xmath193 in the canonical basis ( [ h1basis ] ) of @xmath151 satisfies @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the matrix representing the intersection pairing in this basis , @xmath196 since @xmath197 , @xmath192 is diagonalisable and has eigenvalues @xmath198 ; then ( [ almostsymp ] ) implies that these have to occur with equal multiplicities .",
    "hence the antisymmetric 1-cycles lie in a @xmath199 subgroup of @xmath151 .",
    "to prove ( [ casym ] ) , we consider the basis ( [ obvbasis ] ) .",
    "since @xmath51 is antiholomorphic , it pulls back holomorphic 1-forms on @xmath82 to antiholomorphic 1-forms and vice - versa ; the forms above are mapped as @xmath200 for @xmath201 and @xmath202 . using ( [ pbtau ] ) and ( [ justleq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath203 and for @xmath204 @xmath205 for some @xmath206 .",
    "we conclude that the integral of any global holomorphic 1-form around @xmath207 vanishes , and this implies ( [ casym ] ) .    to illustrate how we can use the conditions ( [ exples ] ) to determine spectral curves of monopoles , we take as example the well - known charge 2 monopole ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which is also considered in @xcite .",
    "the general spectral curve for a centred monopole of charge 2 , after imposing the reality conditions ( [ real ] ) , has the form @xmath208 where @xmath209 is real .",

    "@xmath82 is an elliptic curve and can be constructed by gluing together two copies of the riemann sphere along two branch cuts , that we choose to be on the equator @xmath216 .",
    "we label the two sheets of @xmath82 by @xmath217 , which correspond to the two possible choices of sign for @xmath31 when solving ( [ chrg2 ] ) ; sheet @xmath112 is defined by the function @xmath218 obtained by analytic continuation , avoiding the cuts above , of @xmath219 regarded as a germ at @xmath220 . here , and elsewhere , we consider the principal branch of the root , viz @xmath221 .",
    "we choose a canonical basis @xmath222 of @xmath151 as in figure  [ figchrg2 ] , where we draw the paths as dashed or dotted lines if they lie on sheets @xmath223 or @xmath149 , and write @xmath224 . in this case",
    "@xmath95 is 1-dimensional and a generator is @xmath225 the periods can be expressed in terms of legendre s complete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath226 @xmath227 so equation ( [ exples ] ) reads @xmath228 therefore @xmath229 , and @xmath230 must then be a generator of @xmath231 , which we can take to be @xmath232 , obtaining @xmath233 this can be checked to agree with the result of hurtubise @xcite .",

    "this will be illustrated in section  [ 4hedralspec ] , where we consider a monopole with a spectral curve of higher genus .",
    "in @xcite , corrigan and goddard used the so - called @xmath238 ansatz of atiyah ",
    "ward for instantons to construct a charge @xmath7 solution to the bogomolny  equations ( [ bgmln ] ) with @xmath239 free parameters .",

    "goddard approach does not assume smoothness of the underlying spectral curves ; indeed , it can be used to obtain for example the axially symmetric monopole of arbitrary charge @xmath7 , whose spectral curve is reducible to @xmath7 spherical components .    in the notation",
    "we have introduced , the construction goes as follows .",
    "start with a polynomial @xmath240 as in ( [ speccv ] ) , satisfying the reality constraints ( [ real ] ) .",
    "orient the monopole so that there is an open annulus @xmath14 in @xmath5 which contains the equator @xmath241 but does not contain any of the branch points of @xmath100 .",
    "assume that @xmath14 lifts to @xmath7 disjoint annuli on the spectral curve ; then one can define the branch cuts so that sheet @xmath112 contains one of the lifted annuli , which we denote by @xmath242 . on @xmath243 , consider the function @xmath244 where @xmath245 are some integers to be determined .",
    "this is a lagrange interpolation polynomial in @xmath31 of the @xmath7 conditions that @xmath246 should take the value @xmath247 on @xmath242 . for @xmath248 , define the functions @xmath249 from the coefficients of @xmath250 in @xmath246 as follows : @xmath251 corrigan and goddard s analysis then leads to the conditions @xmath252 and @xmath253 these are @xmath254 constraints on the @xmath255 coefficients of @xmath240 , just as one obtains using the ercolani  sinha algorithm .",
    "when the spectral curve is nonsingular , we would expect them to be equivalent to ( [ justleq1 ] ) .",

    "therefore , we can read off the functions @xmath249 in ( [ thetar ] ) as @xmath266 so far , we have shown that , for the @xmath112th term in the sum , the numerator depends only on @xmath111 and @xmath30 . using ( [ dpdej ] )",
    ", we can eliminate altogether the dependence on the functions @xmath267 with @xmath268 , and this allows us to write for @xmath269 @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the lift of @xmath67 to sheet @xmath112 .",

    "we conclude that all the homogeneous equations ( @xmath204 ) in ( [ justleq1 ] ) can be obtained from ( [ newcgr ] ) if we consider first the @xmath286 equations corresponding to @xmath287 and continue decreasing @xmath179 down to @xmath149 , using at each stage the vanishing of the integrals for greater @xmath179 from the previous steps .",
    "the @xmath288 equation also agrees with ( [ newcg1 ] ) , since we can use ( [ newcgr ] ) and the coefficient of @xmath289 in the numerator of @xmath290 is @xmath232 .",

    "now we apply the method of section [ ercsin ] to investigate the spectral curve of the tetrahedrally symmetric monopole of charge  @xmath291 .",
    "this was first studied in  @xcite , where the existence of the monopole was proved by imposing tetrahedral symmetry to simplify nahm s equations and solve them in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "a numerical treatment of the adhmn construction was developed and applied to this monopole in  @xcite , which allowed the fields to be computed and , using these , level surfaces for the energy density were plotted .",
    "as in @xcite , we start with the ansatz @xmath292 for the spectral curve @xmath82 , where @xmath293 is a nonzero constant to be determined ; the reality conditions imply @xmath294 .",

    "we choose to connect the @xmath297 s and the @xmath298 s together along arcs of circles centred at the origin and antipodal to each other as shown in figure  [ figcuts ] .",

    "it is not hard to see that one obtains a compact riemann surface of genus four when three copies of the riemann sphere are identified along the branch cuts as specified in figure  [ figcuts ] .",
    "in fact , by identifying three copies of the upper or lower hemispheres along the pair of cuts as above , one obtains a torus with three discs removed ; the circles of the boundary correspond to the equators of the spheres we started with .",
    "gluing together the two surfaces obtained in this way along their boundaries gives a compact curve of genus four .",

    "the version of the ercolani  sinha constraints that we derived in section  [ ercsin ] generalises the corrigan ",
    "goddard conditions to all monopoles with a nonsingular spectral curve .",
    "an interesting aspect is the existence of a distinguished 1-cycle @xmath10 on the spectral curve . the premises in the corrigan ",
    "goddard approach lead to the constraint ( [ cgc ] ) for @xmath10 , but their conditions are otherwise equivalent to equation ( [ oures ] ) . in section [ 4hedral ] , we have applied ( [ oures ] ) to rederive the scale parameter @xmath293 in the spectral curve of the tetrahedrally symmetric monopole of charge 3 .",
    "we also verified that this monopole provides an example where our condition ( [ oures ] ) can be satisfied but those of corrigan and goddard are not .",
    "let us make some remarks about the nature of the special 1-cycle @xmath10 . given a nonsingular spectral curve @xmath82 in @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath10 is uniquely determined as the solution to equation ( [ oures ] ) ; we have established that it is always antisymmetric under the real structure . moreover , although the left - hand side of ( [ oures ] ) depends on the spatial orientation of the monopole , @xmath10 remains constant along the @xmath39 orbit of @xmath82 in the moduli space @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , its components in a given homology basis are integer solutions to a linear equation and can not change when the spectral curve is rotated , since the period matrix occurring in ( [ quant1 ] ) never becomes singular .",
    "this argument applies to more general deformations in @xmath6 that do not pass through monopoles with a singular spectral curve .",
    "it also implies that @xmath10 has to be invariant under any rotational symmetry of the spectral curve , and this imposes further restrictions  for example , in the case of the tetrahedrally symmetric 3-monopole that we studied in section [ 4hedral ] , this consideration together with the @xmath51-antisymmetry completely determines @xmath10 up to sign .",
    "as implied in @xcite , the components of the 1-cycle @xmath10 are the characteristics of the line bundle @xmath90 and can thus be interpreted as giving the direction of the linear flow determined by nahm s equations on the jacobian of the spectral curve @xmath82 .",
    "another interpretation for @xmath10 is afforded by equation ( [ defmn ] ) .",
    "recall that the triviality of @xmath90 provides for two nowhere vanishing functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 on the open sets @xmath99 and @xmath116 .",
    "we may wonder whether we can define logarithms of these functions .",
    "and of course the answer is no : the nonzero components of @xmath10 correspond to nontrivial periods of both @xmath416 and @xmath417 , and so they can not be exact 1-forms . to define the logarithms , one should eliminate the 1-cycles correponding to the nonzero periods , by cutting @xmath82 along their conjugate homology 1-cyles in the canonical basis ( [ h1basis ] ) .",
    "but we can see from ( [ esc ] ) that this is equivalent to cutting @xmath82 along @xmath10 .",
    "the riemann surface of @xmath418 or @xmath419 is then obtained from the cut surfaces @xmath99 or @xmath116 by analytic continuation across the cuts , and this yields an infinite cover of the original open sets .",
    "so we may regard @xmath10 as a topological obstruction to defining the logarithms of the nowhere vanishing functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 on the spectral curve punctured at the points lying over @xmath420 and @xmath421 , respectively .",
    "we should emphasise that the ercolani ",
    "sinha algorithm is still not sufficient to ensure smoothness of the fields if @xmath143 , since it does not include the condition ( [ smooth ] ) .",
    "the family of nonsingular spectral curves of monopoles has codimension zero in the family of real curves in @xmath89 satisfying equation ( [ oures ] ) , but the inclusion is proper in general .",
    "for example , it can be shown that the icosahedrally symmetric curve @xmath422 satisfies ( [ oures ] ) for some constant @xmath293 , but not ( [ smooth ] ) ; this follows from the conclusion in @xcite that there is no 6-monopole with icosahedral symmetry .",
    "it is known @xcite that an icosahedrally symmetric monopole of charge @xmath423 exists , and its spectral curve is reducible to a projective line and a smooth genus @xmath424 curve of the form ( [ pseudo6 ] ) , with @xmath425 .",
    "an interesting question is to understand how ( [ oures ] ) degenerates when a spectral curve becomes singular .",
    "some singularities arise by imposing interesting symmetries on the monopoles , as in the case of the axially symmetric monopoles that we have mentioned already .",
    "we may expect that the condition still holds for other singular spectral curves , but it is not clear how the 1-cycle @xmath10 is to be determined in general .",
