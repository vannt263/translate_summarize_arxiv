    "there is an analogy among certain boundary conditions and the effect of external fields .",
    "some boundary conditions lead to new physical effects as it is for instance the anisotropic box created by two parallel metallic plates of length @xmath3 separated by a distance @xmath4 , placed in vacuum . for @xmath5",
    "an attractive force appears in between the plates , as produced by the zero point vacuum energy of electromagnetic modes , leading to the well - known casimir effect @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the casimir effect shows that if one breaks the symmetry in a region of space , the energy @xmath6 of the vacuum modes results distributed anisotropically .",
    "we may consider the vector @xmath7 perpendicular to the plates as characterizing the symmetry breakdown .",
    "only vacuum modes of momentum @xmath8 in the direction of symmetry breakdown are allowed inside the cavity ( then @xmath9 ) .",
    "a negative pressure dependent on @xmath4 arises inside the plates , and perpendicular to them .    on the other hand",
    ", it is known that in an external magnetic field @xmath10 , the momentum of an electron ( positron ) in the direction perpendicular to the field is quantized @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting to inquire then if an effect similar to the casimir one is produced by the zero point electron - positron energy of vacuum in an external constant magnetic field .",
    "the electron - positron zero point vacuum energy in an external electromagnetic field was obtained by heisenberg and euler @xcite . in the specific case of an external constant magnetic field",
    ", this expression results as the pure vacuum term contribution when calculating the tadpole term of the thermodynamic potential @xmath12 in a medium @xcite . in this calculation one",
    "starts from the energy eigenvalues of the dirac equation for an electron ( positron ) in a constant magnetic field @xmath10 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , are the landau quantum numbers , @xmath15 is the momentum component along the magnetic field ( we consider @xmath10 parallel to the third axes ) and @xmath16 is the electron mass .",
    "the general expression for @xmath12 contains two terms @xmath17 the first one is the quantum statistical contribution which vanishes in the limit of zero temperature and zero density .",
    "the second term accounts for the zero - point energy : it contains the contribution coming from the virtual electron - positron pairs created and annihilated spontaneously in vacuum and interacting with the field @xmath10 . in the one loop approximation , where no radiative corrections are considered , it has the expression @xmath18 with @xmath19 . as can be observed , ( [ pot1 ] ) is a divergent quantity .",
    "after regularization it leads to the euler - heisenberg expression @xmath20\\frac{d x}{x}. \\label{eh}\\ ] ] we observe that the vacuum term regularization demands the addition of a negative infinite term proportional to @xmath21 which absorbs the classical energy term @xmath22 .",
    "the vacuum thermodynamic potential is actually negative .",
    "we interpret it according to the general energy - momentum tensor expression in a constant magnetic field ( see i.e. @xcite ) for the case of zero temperature and zero chemical potential , @xmath23 leading to a positive pressure @xmath24 along the magnetic field @xmath10 , and to a negative pressure @xmath25 in the direction perpendicular to the field , where @xmath26 is the magnetization , which is obtained from ( [ eh ] ) as @xmath27d x\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the magnetization ( [ magnetization ] ) is a positive quantity .",
    "moreover , it has a non- linear dependence on the field @xmath10 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] . in this sense",
    ", vacuum has ferromagnetic properties , although in our present one - loop approximation we do not consider the spin - spin interaction between virtual particles .    concerning the transverse pressure @xmath28",
    ", we get @xmath29d x.\\ ] ] @xmath30 is negative and it may lead to some effects for small as well for high fields . it must be stressed that the term @xmath31 subtracted to @xmath32 in @xmath30 is the quantum statistical analogue of the pressure due to the lorentz force for particles ( in the present case virtual ) bearing a magnetic moment , which leads to @xmath33 @xcite",
    "fields currently achieved in laboratories are very small if compared with the critical field @xmath35 . when this limit condition holds @xmath36 , one can write , @xmath37 and in consequence @xmath38 in usual units it reads @xmath39 where the characteristic parameter @xmath40 is @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the magnetic wavelength @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the compton wavelength @xmath45 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath46 coincides with the area corresponding to one magnetic flux quantum @xmath47 .",
    "pressure then is a function of the field dependent parameter @xmath40 , which is determined by the ratio between the compton wavelength and the `` one fluxon area '' .",
    "the expression for the transverse pressure ( [ pv ] ) looks similar to the expression for the negative pressure due to the casimir effect between parallel metallic plates @xcite @xmath48    @xmath30 is then a casimir- like pressure , in the sense that it is due to the bounded motion of virtual electron - positron pairs . for small fields , of order @xmath49 g , it is negligible as compared with the usual casimir pressure .",
    "but for larger fields , e.g. for @xmath50 g it becomes larger ; one may obtain then pressures up to @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : casimir ] ) . for a distance between plates @xmath52 , gives @xmath53 , i.e. , five orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "this suggests that vacuum interaction with the magnetic field may produce observable effects for fields , which can be realized in nature or in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "at this point , thinking in possible astrophysical consequences , it is useful to analyze the behavior of transverse vacuum pressure for large magnetic fields , i.e. , for fields of the order of the critical one @xmath54 and larger .",
    "fields of these orders can be generated due to gravitational and rotational effects in stellar objects @xcite , where the electron - positron gas play an important role .",
    "we use a model of white dwarf , in which the main contribution to thermodynamic magnitudes comes from the electron sector , described as a degenerate quantum gas .",
    "there is also a nuclei background , which compensate the electrical charge , but it behaves like a classical gas , and leads to quantities negligible small as compared with those of the electron gas .",
    "the statistical contribution of electrons to the transverse pressure , in the degenerate limit , is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the landau state number , and @xmath57 is the chemical potential , related to the electron density through the expression @xmath58 and @xmath59 is an integer @xmath60    in the extreme case of sufficiently strong magnetic field @xmath61 , all the electron system is in the landau ground state @xmath62 . but it is easy to note that this state does not contribute to the statistical pressure . in other words , when the electrons are confined to the landau ground state , the total transverse pressure is equal to the vacuum one and is negative .",
    "it causes system instability .",
    "it means that there is a limit value of magnetic field for which the system stability may be preserved , and it depends on the electron density @xmath63 for fields @xmath64 the instability is produced , and the transverse pressure becomes negative due to the vacuum term . for less fields , that is for @xmath65 , we must consider both contributions : statistical and vacuum one . for typical densities of a white dwarf @xmath66 we find @xmath67 . in this particular case , if @xmath65 we get @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for @xmath64 .",
    "we conclude that when @xmath64 the star collapses .",
    "it agree with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "a different situation is produced for larger fields . for @xmath0 ,",
    "pressures of order @xmath70 are found , and thus , _ it may be of the same order than the statistical term _ , although densities @xmath1 are required to keep @xmath71 .",
    "the vacuum contribution becomes of the same importance of the statistical one and must be taken into account in any analysis of the system stability .",
    "in fact for these field intensities , it may happen that the total transverse pressure may not vanish , and even become negative , although the electron system were not confined to the landau ground state @xmath62 .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the effects of vacuum interaction with the magnetic field can not be neglected if we compare them with the effects produced due to the same interaction of the real particle system , for @xmath0 .",
    "we can expect then , that the vacuum role becomes more and more relevant for larger fields .",
    "one way of handling this problem is by including the effect of radiative corrections through an anomalous magnetic moment , and modifying consequently the energy spectrum , which would appear as a solution of the dirac equation for a charged particle with anomalous magnetic moment @xcite @xmath73 for @xmath14 , where @xmath74 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath75 are the @xmath76 eigenvalues corresponding to the two orientations of the magnetic moment with respect to the field @xmath10 .",
    "the vacuum thermodynamic potential has now the form @xmath77 after regularization , it transforms in to @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 . due to the smallness of the factor @xmath82 , in the series expansion ( [ pot2.1 ] ) we can neglect all terms @xmath83 with @xmath81 , except for fields @xmath84 , being @xmath85 , when more terms should be include .",
    "the magnetization and transverse pressure become @xmath86 @xmath87 it must be noted that for @xmath88 although @xmath89 remains negative , it grows more slowly than for fields @xmath90 , and its absolute value is smaller than @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pr.anom ] ) .",
    "fields of very high orders @xmath91 have been suggested to be found in the cores of extremely magnetized neutron stars .",
    "but an electron system is hardly in equilibrium for this range of fields , and for these stellar objects the neutron and proton gases are the most important . the last suggests that the interaction of quark - antiquark virtual pairs with the magnetic field should be studied . as the interaction energy with the magnetic field may become comparable with the color field interaction among quarks , we may consider the quark interaction with the magnetic field in a similar way as the electron gas .",
    "we may write the electromagnetic vacuum energy of the quark - antiquark field in presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the main contribution comes from the u - type quark , which has a smaller mass than other quarks . for u - type quark we can write    @xmath92    where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the u - quark charge and mass , respectively , and @xmath95 .",
    "the expression ( [ upot ] ) for the vacuum quark - antiquark electromagnetic energy is valid for fields up to @xmath96 .",
    "the magnetization has the form @xmath97 and the transverse pressure is @xmath98    the transverse vacuum pressure gives figures of the order of @xmath99 for fields @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for fields @xmath102 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upressure ] .",
    "a magnetic field modify the electron - positron zero - point energy of vacuum , leading to new physical effects .",
    "the vacuum shows a nonlinear response , as a ferromagnetic medium .",
    "a negative pressure , exerted in the direction perpendicular to the field , appears as a casimir- like force , which must produce observable effects for fields @xmath103 .",
    "the electron - positron zero - point energy leads to a transverse pressure of similar order of the statistical one for fields @xmath0 , and densities @xmath1 or larger would be required in order to avoid the collapse .",
    "vacuum shrinks perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this leads us to conclude that nuclear and/or quark matter is unstable for fields @xmath104 , @xmath105 being the nucleon mass .",
    "as the contribution of the transverse quark pressure is smaller than its longitudinal term , the vacuum negative transverse pressure makes the system to implode .",
