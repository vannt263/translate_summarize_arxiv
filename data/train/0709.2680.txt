    "granular materials are being widely studied by the physics community since they exhibit unusual and distinctive properties @xcite .",
    "these materials are composed of macroscopic particles that interact by a dissipative contact force and can be thought of as displaying gas , liquid and solid phases .",
    "a suitable model for the study of granular materials is to consider each grain as a hard sphere , ignoring fragmentation and moving the effect of deformation to the dissipative term .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , the wide applicability of these model to the study of liquids , glasses and colloids implies a paramount importance of the geometrical properties of the packing of hard spheres in determining the physics exhibited by the materials analyzed .",
    "the geometry of granular packing has been investigated _",
    "i.e. _ by @xcite and @xcite using voronoi - delaunay partitioning to identify structures in the former and volume distributions in the latter .    in the present work",
    "we propose , in the same line of those and other works @xcite , a structural study of granular packing but using tools specifically developed in the frame of complex networks .",
    "as will be explained later we define for each packing a network of contacts , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which topological properties are studied afterwards .",
    "the contact topology of a granular packing can be studied as a graph where particles are _ nodes _ and the interacting force pairs _ edges_. this approach has important advantages . for one hand , it is a quantitative tool as are not other ideas proposed in the granular community , namely , that of  force chains \" @xcite ; it is an abstract point of view that allows to reach very primitive concepts such as connectivity over which to elaborate more complex definitions ; and , finally , the field of complex networks provides us with a great amount of concepts and algorithms among which we can chose the most suitable for our proposes of characterization .",
    "the remainder of this work is structured as follows : in section @xmath0 we explain the numerical method used and the protocol followed to obtain the samples that we study . in section",
    "@xmath1 the topological properties analyzed are defined and results presented for several different conditions .",
    "finally , in section @xmath2 we summarize our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "we perform soft particle molecular dynamics simulations of discs in two dimensions .",
    "the model of contact includes a linear restoring force in the normal direction of the impact and a tangential force providing static friction .",
    "the complete details of the simulation protocol are carefully described in @xcite .",
    "the values used for the parameters of the force model are : the frictional coefficient ( @xmath3 ) , the elastic constant ( @xmath4 ) , a dissipative coefficient @xmath5 , and the corresponding ones for the tangential component ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) with an integration time step @xmath8 .",
    "the stiffness constants @xmath9 are measured in units of @xmath10 , the damping constants @xmath11 in @xmath12 and time in @xmath13 . here ,",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand , respectively , for the mass of the discs , the diameter of the discs and the acceleration of gravity .    a typical simulation starts by randomly placing the discs in a wide horizontal area such that no one of them is in contact with any other and the packing fraction is around @xmath17 .",
    "discs are given random velocities drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "four walls made up with the same grains that constitute the bulk compress the system until a certain predefined threshold of force is attained .",
    "it is important to note that due to the dissipative nature of the interactions the final kinetic energy is vanishing small .",
    "the final configuration obtained is saved in order to be carefully analysed .",
    "this configuration is named a  jammed state \" by the granular community and essentially corresponds to a metastable equilibrium state compatible with the history of the configuration .",
    "we run simulations under several different conditions to check the variation of the results with the number of grains , polydispersity , friction coefficient , maximum applied pressure and geometry of the compression cell .",
    "let us call sample a that obtained with a bidisperse mixture of discs , @xmath18 with radii @xmath15 and the rest with radii @xmath19 and parameter values as given above ; sample b has the same properties than a but the disks are monodisperse with radius @xmath15 ; sample c is bidisperse as a but the friction coefficient is @xmath20 ; sample d is the same as c but the final pressure is increased a @xmath21 ; finally , sample e is the same as a but the bounadary conditions are circular instead of square . for samples a and b we run simulations with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 discs , for samples c , d and e only with @xmath24 since , as will be shown , no significant dependence on system size is found . in order to attain good statistics we perform @xmath25 independent simulations for each sample and average the results .",
    "in the first place we define our network , i.e. a set of nodes connected by edges @xcite , as follows . every grain with",
    ", at least , one contact constitutes a node and edges are the connections between the grains ( nodes ) in contact .",
    "there is a contact between two grains if the distance between the centre of them is smaller or equal to its diameter .",
    "a contact defines a certain amount of normal force @xmath26 between the grains .",
    "such situation has been deeply studied by many authors using mainly lattices diffusive models @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of these works is that , independently of the system details , the mean value of the force distribution @xmath27 is a typical scale of the problem .",
    "nevertheless , many open questions remain open about the properties of these systems : why the fluctuations in the force distribution are as large as @xmath28 ?",
    "which statistical framework is suitable to explain the experimental results ?    in order to study the role of the topology on this problem we will use the tools introduced in the theory of complex networks .",
    "we introduce a force threshold @xmath29 such that any contact with a normal force bigger than @xmath29 is an edge , but contacts with lower values of normal force are not edges and grains with no contact are not nodes .",
    "thus we obtain a network which depends on @xmath29 , and hence its topological properties can be studied as a function of @xmath29 . in our definitions",
    "we do not consider the grains of the walls . in the remainder of this section we present the results obtained for each of the topological properties studied along with their definitions @xcite .      in our case , the connectivity @xmath9 of a node represents the number of contacts between neighboring particles .",
    "then , the degree distribution @xmath30 is the distribution function of the number of contacts per particle . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a we show the degree distribution of sample a for three different sample sizes showing that there is no substantial variation . in all the cases the maximum @xmath30",
    "is found for @xmath31 and around @xmath32 of the particles present values of @xmath9 between 2 and 4 .",
    "the degree distribution for the rest of the samples with @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "the overall behavior of the function @xmath30 remains the same for all samples and only slight deviations are appreciated for samples c and d. in particular , samples c and d display higher number of nodes with higher values of @xmath9 .",
    "this result can be understood if it is considered that samples c and d are the ones with the smaller friction coefficient .",
    "this will result in a small amount of arches inside the sample and consequently a reduction of the amount of particles that display just two contacts .     for sample a using @xmath34 discs .",
    "in the right panel we show @xmath30 with @xmath33 for all samples.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in figure fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we show the behavior of the average connectivity @xmath35 as a function of the force threshold @xmath36 for sample a. again , this property seems independent of the system size . the figure fig .",
    "[ fig3]b shows the results obtained for the different samples .",
    "again , small differences are appreciable for samples c and d without modification of the overall behavior .",
    "the most prominent feature is a fast decay of the connectivity upon increasing the force threshold .",
    "it could be said that the small forces are the ones which keep the network connected and the connectivity almost disappears when they are removed .",
    "the geodesic distance @xmath37 between two nodes is the smallest number of edges that separate them .",
    "this quantity can be measured by a number of algorithms , we used the _ breadth first search_. the diameter @xmath38 of the network is the longest of the geodesic distances . in figure fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the normalized geodesic distance @xmath39 as a function of @xmath36 is shown for sample a. the geodesic distance is normalized by @xmath40 since the geodesic distance increases with the number of particles conforming the sample @xmath41 .",
    "this scaling of @xmath37 with the network size is what would correspond to a square lattice , so in the limit case of @xmath42 our network seems to be not very different of a square one .",
    "the peak near @xmath43 can be explained in terms of the polygons that appear in the network as will be shown later . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] it is shown that there is no difference in the behavior of the geodesic distance for the different samples .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows @xmath44 , the network diameter normalized by @xmath45 .",
    "this normalization factor is applied to show that the diameter of the network scales with the diagonal of the compression cell .",
    "the behavior is entirely similar to that of the geodesic distance and only a small deviation is noticeable for sample e which was generated with a circular cell .",
    "for this reason we can attribute this minor difference to the scaling factor .",
    "we define a cluster as a group of nodes mutually connected .",
    "the total number of nodes in the network includes nodes from different clusters . in the inset of fig .",

    "the number of nodes in the network decays exponentially , the line in both figures has slope @xmath46 , as the force threshold @xmath36 is increased beyond @xmath43 .",
    "before the point @xmath43 the number of nodes decays only slightly . for @xmath47",
    "the normalized number of nodes is not @xmath48 implying that there are grains without any contact .",
    "this is due to the frictional nature of the medium which is able to create arches surrounding one or more grains .",

    "the inset shows the power @xmath56 of the cluster size distribution @xmath52 as a function of @xmath36.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the average cluster size @xmath57 as a function of @xmath36 with an inset showing the behavior of @xmath56 .",
    "if we had retained the largest cluster to compute the sizes distribution , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] would display a monotonically increasing function upon decreasing @xmath36 .",
    "instead , it reveals a characteristic feature , a peak around @xmath58 which is accompanied by a minimum in @xmath59 around @xmath60",
    ".      in the theory of critical phenomena the value of the fractal dimension determines the universality of a system , and thus , a set of properties . in this section",
    "we compute the fractal dimension as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "two such fractal dimensions can be defined @xcite : the mass fractal dimension and the box counting fractal dimension .",
    "the former is computed choosing a node and tracing circumferences of increasing radius @xmath61 around it .",
    "the mass @xmath62 , in number of nodes , inside each circumference is computed and if it behaves like @xmath63 then @xmath64 is the mass fractal dimension .",
    "this procedure is repeated changing the initial node and averaging the results .",
    "the boxcounting fractal dimension is computed analyzing how the minimum @xmath65 number of boxes necessary to cover the network changes with the box size @xmath66 .",
    "if this verifies @xmath67 then @xmath68 is the box counting fractal dimension .",
    "the process of minimization involved in the last calculation renders it non immediate and we followed the methods exposed in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for both , the mass fractal dimension and the box counting fractal dimension , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] as a function of the force threshold @xmath36 .",
    "both dimensions are fairly equal to @xmath69 for values of @xmath36 , roughly , lower than @xmath48 .",
    "a slight increase can be perceived from @xmath47 until @xmath70 where a marked drop takes place .",
    "this fall of the fractal dimension is sharper and deeper for the mass dimension but clearly present in both cases .",
    "the calculation of the fractal dimensions can not be carried out beyond the limit shown since the network rapidly disaggregates .",
    "thus we find a change of behavior of the contact network in the vicinity of @xmath43 that could be assigned to a change in the universality class that describes the network as a function of the force threshold .",
    "for all samples with @xmath33 .",
    "right panel : the box counting fractal dimension as a function of @xmath36 for all samples with @xmath33.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      a third order loop is defined as a three - step walk whose first and last nodes are the same .",
    "third order loops are thus contacts arranged in a triangular fashion whose number can be computed by the clustering coefficient @xcite or the third moment of the adjacency matrix @xcite . in rigidity theory",
    "@xcite these are , in two dimensions , the simplest rigid structures . indeed",
    "if we think in a triangle whose edges are rigid and joined by freely rotational hinges it remains undeformed upon external perturbations . on the contrary a square made of rigid edges and freely rotational hinges",
    "is easily deformed by shear in parallel sides .",
    "it is important to note that it is a sufficient , but not necessary , condition for a polygon to be rigid that all its faces are composed of triangles .",
    "thus , triangles may be important for the rigidity displayed by granular packings in two dimensions .     for all samples with @xmath33 .",
    "the inset shows the same data in semilogarithmic scale.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the number of triangles is reported for all samples .",
    "there are no triangles beyond @xmath71 and they concentrate in the edges carrying a small amount of normal force , increasing exponentially when decreasing the force threshold .",
    "we believe that the apparition of third order loops of contacts is at the heart of the behavior found for some of the topological properties presented in this paper as the geodesic distance and the network diameter . for force values above @xmath72",
    "a decrease in the force threshold provokes the connection of different clusters of the network and then , both the geodesic distance and the network diameter grow .",
    "however , a further decrease in the force threshold below @xmath72 implies the apparition of third order loops which will reduce the geodesic distance between the nodes that belong to them , and hence the diameter of the network .",
    "the way in which a third order loop reduces the geodesic distance between nodes can be easily understood .",
    "if we imagine three nodes ( a , b , c ) where the connections are a - b and b - c , the mean geodesic distance in the cluster will be 1.33 as a - b and b - c are separated by one edge but a - c are separated by two edges . in the same way the diameter of this small network will be @xmath0 as it is the maximum geodesic distance between the nodes .",
    "if now the nodes a and c are also connected giving rise to a third order loop , both the mean geodesic distance and the diameter of the network will be reduced to 1 .",
    "in this work we report on some topological properties of the force interactions of granular packings by means of ideas specifically introduced for complex networks .",
    "our aim is to characterize the heterogeneity of these systems without using definitions that may change from one author to another , like usually occurs in the case of force chains .     and @xmath73 have been treated separately .",
    "the subnetworks thus obtained exhibit well differentiated behaviors in the region of low connectivity.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the set of properties analyzed is insensitive to the size of the system and shows only slight variations of behavior when the friction coefficient or the applied pressure are changed .",
    "thus , they constitute a robust and useful description of an heterogeneous material like the packing studied .",
    "it is noteworthy that all the properties that have been analyzed as a function of the force threshold @xmath36 , that determines if an edge is present in the network or not , display some distinctive feature or sharp variation in the vicinity of @xmath70 .",
    "this behavior is indicative of a change in the structural properties of the network in this point . as has been pointed out by radjai _",
    "_ there seems to be two subnetworks in the network of contacts , one  weak \" network composed of small forces and containing around @xmath74 of grains , and a  strong \" network constituted by edges carrying a force above the average .",
    "our findings seem to support the existence of these two subnetworks . as the force threshold",
    "is increased we remove the weak network and retain only the strong one , leading to dramatic changes that signal the change of behavior expected if both subnetworks exist and are intrinsically different . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show the connectivities distribution for both subnetworks .",
    "it can be checked that they are quite similar for high connectivities while differ significatively around @xmath75 .",
    "a natural extension of this work is to consider the intensity of the force in every edge of the network and define weighted networks .",
    "this point of view could be a more suitable tool in order to relate structural features of the network with the physical properties of the packing ; in particular , it could shed light into the question of the change of behavior at @xmath70 .",
