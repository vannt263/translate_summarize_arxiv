    "<S> also the nominally pure crystals has always some impurities and defects .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest variant of disorder is the intercalation of impurities into the interlayer space , which does not modify the intralayer magnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> similar model explains the glassy features of @xmath1 - small concentration of @xmath2 ions in the ferromagnetic layers containing @xmath3 does not essentially affect them , while the presence of @xmath3 ions in @xmath2 layers results in appearance of local ferromagnetic interlayer exchange on the background of small antiferromagnetic one @xcite . in this case one may hope to get comparatively simple description of disorder effects , especially when radius of magnetic intralayer interaction is much greater than a lattice parameter . </S>",
    "<S> then intralayer ordering can be considered in the mean - field approximation everywhere except a narrow vicinity of transition point . here the interlayer exchange fluctuations are averaged over intralayer interaction range , which can be put infinite in this mean - field region . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we get a quasi one - dimensional situation with some average interlayer interaction @xcite . then theoretical description becomes simpler than in case of @xmath4 disorder and one may try to get some analytical results on the thermodynamics of such random layered magnet , preserving some specific features of spin glasses , particularly , the presence of multiple metastable states . </S>",
    "<S> the origin and properties of such states is a central issue of the theory of random magnets , so the study of such model could give not only approximate description of thermodynamics of real crystals but also shed some light on the mechanism of emergence of multiple metastable states responsible for the inergodic behavior of spin glasses .    </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the simplest model of ising magnet having infinite - range ferromagnetic intralayer interaction and random exchange between spins in neighboring layers . </S>",
    "<S> it allows to obtain rather easily an effective thermodynamic potential for the layers magnetizations near transition point . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can make sufficiently complete study of the origin and the properties of various metastable states for the case of zero average interlayer exchange . </S>",
    "<S> further we establish the existence of a number of equilibrium spin - glass phases for different values of random exchange fluctuations and describe phase transitions between them . </S>"
