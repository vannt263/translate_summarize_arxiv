    "in relativistic mean field theories with scalar and vector potentials the dirac hamiltonian for a fermion ( nucleon ) of mass @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the usual dirac matrices .",
    "we have introduced the  sum \" and the  difference \" potentials defined by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . when @xmath9 or @xmath10 , due to the matrix structure of @xmath11 , the dirac hamiltonian is invariant under a su(2 ) symmetry @xcite . this is a general feature which does not depend on the particular form of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we will consider only the case @xmath12 ( @xmath2 ) and a harmonic oscillator potential with angular frequency @xmath13 for the @xmath14 potential , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath15 .    a more generalized form of the relativistic harmonic oscillator where the case @xmath10 is also discussed has been presented recently @xcite . following the details of that paper",
    "it is easy to prove that , for the case @xmath9 , the lower component of the dirac spinor satisfies the differential equation @xmath16f_\\kappa(r)=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : d2ordfofr2}\\ ] ] as shown in @xcite , @xmath17 is not the non - relativistic angular momentum @xmath18 but rather the pseudo - orbital angular momentum of the lower component of the dirac spinor .",
    "they are related by @xmath19 , where the quantum number @xmath20 determines whether spins are parallel or antiparallel .",
    "pseudospin symmetry is exact when doublets with @xmath21 are degenerate , where @xmath22 is the pseudospin quantum number .",
    "the eigenenergies are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the radial quantum number related to the nodes of the lower component @xmath25 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : enrohpapertilde ] ) one concludes that the real solutions must have positive binding energy @xmath26 .",
    "the second order equation ( [ eq : d2ordfofr2 ] ) , which only depends on @xmath17 , and also the eigenenergy equation ( [ eq : enrohpapertilde ] ) , show that there is no pseudospin  orbit coupling .",
    "therefore the states with same @xmath27 , but with @xmath28 and @xmath29 are degenerate : they can be seen as pseudospin doublets as discussed in @xcite .",
    "thus , when @xmath14 is a harmonic oscillator potential and @xmath9 , pseudospin symmetry is exact and there are only positive - energy bound states , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath14 acts as a binding potential .",
    "this is an interesting result in view of the fact that the pseudospin symmetry obtained in the limit @xmath30 can not be realized for nuclear vector and scalar mean - fields which go to zero as @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , in that case , @xmath32 acts as a binding negative central potential well and therefore",
    "no bound states may exist when @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of single particle states for the case @xmath9 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spcposignl ] ( a ) using the quantum numbers of the upper component , that can be related to the non - relativistic quantum numbers .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spcposignl ] ( b ) we classify the same energy levels by the quantum numbers of the lower components @xmath35 .",
    "the comparison between these two figures exhibits the pseudospin symmetry and its quantum numbers .",
    "for example , the doublets @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] , which have the same pseudo angular momentum @xmath17 and the same @xmath24 , are , in the new notation , @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] , respectively .",
    "therefore , the harmonic oscillator with @xmath9 and @xmath40 provides an example of exact pseudospin symmetry .",
    "[ fig : spcposignl ] ( a ) also shows the @xmath41 degeneracy , which means that not only the states with same @xmath42 are degenerate ( pseudospin partners ) but also , for example , @xmath43 or @xmath44 have the same energy .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of the eigenvalue equation in eq.([eq : enrohpapertilde ] ) is reached when @xmath45 , which , in turn , means that @xmath46 , giving @xmath47 this equation , valid for @xmath9 , shows that the energy is of second order in the ratio @xmath48 , meaning that the energy is zero up to first order in @xmath48 .",
    "we can interpret this fact by saying that , up to this order , there is no non - relativistic limit for @xmath9 and therefore the theory is intrinsically relativistic and so is the pseudospin symmetry .",
    "when @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) a pseudospin orbit term shows up in the equation for the lower component given by @xmath51 where the prime denote the derivative with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath20 is the quantum number referred to before .",
    "so when @xmath53 the denominator , @xmath54 , can become very small near the pole and the contribution of this term can be quite significant , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this manifests the non - perturbative breaking of this symmetry when @xmath55 , as it is the case for the nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , we may overcome this problem if we keep @xmath56 but a tensor potential @xmath57 is introduced in the dirac equation . in this case",
    "a new term appears in the spin - orbit term , @xmath58 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "because of the product @xmath59 , the pole structure in the denominator discussed before is absent .     with @xmath33 and @xmath60 as a function of @xmath61.,width=234 ]     with @xmath33 , @xmath62 and @xmath60.,width=234 ]    if we choose a linear form for @xmath63 , we have an additional quadratic central potential with a frequency @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d2ordfofr2 ] ) , so that we still have a global harmonic oscillator central potential .",
    "moreover , we generate a pseudospin orbit term @xmath65 .",
    "thus , with this new term , the @xmath17 degeneracy ( pseudospin symmetry ) can be broken perturbatively in the sense that can be made so small as the @xmath64 frequency .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : oh_04 ] how this symmetry is broken for the @xmath66 states , for positive @xmath64 , and present the eigenenergies in the spectroscopic notation @xmath67 , where states with @xmath68 are denoted by @xmath69 respectively .",
    "interestingly , from fig .  [",
    "fig : oh_05 ] we see that with the breaking tensor potential there is a value of @xmath64 for which @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , a state with @xmath72 rather than @xmath73 , becomes the ground state .    finally , the relativistic nature of the pseudospin symmetry with harmonic oscillator potentials shown here suggests that this symmetry may be more important in ultra - relativistic systems .",
    "thus , this symmetry may play a role in high density matter , such as the matter inside compact stars .",
