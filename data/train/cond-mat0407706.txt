    "@xmath0 is a magnetic semiconductor in which magnetic order apparently controls the bandgap .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition at @xmath1 is signaled by a sharp increase in plasma frequency@xcite and a sharp drop in resistivity@xcite @xcite @xcite . in this paper",
    "we formulate a model which captures the physics of @xmath0 , and solve it in the dynamical mean field approximation .",
    "the important technical step is the accurate determination of first order phase boundaries via the construction of the free energies of competing phases .",
    "we present a general phase diagram , which includes a change in the order of the transition from first to second .",
    "remarkably , the change occurs not by the vanishing of a fourth order coefficient but simply by an exchange of stabilities .",
    "we show that for a choice of parameters consistent with what is calculated for @xmath0 @xcite , the various experimental data are semiquantitatively reproduced . for these parameters",
    ", we predict that @xmath0 should exhibit a metamagnetic phase transition , and we estimate the location of the transition line and its endpoints .",
    "the change in order of the phase transition might be accessible in pressure experiments .",
    "the analysis reported here may be thought of as a more precise solution of a model proposed by @xcite .",
    "our solution agrees with theirs in essential aspects but provides a sharper picture of physics and includes some new features .",
    "we also note that the band structure of the material is presently the subject of controversy with photoemission experiments @xcite indicating a large gap ( implying that the material is intrinsically insulating so the metallic behavior is due to defects which dope the system ) while some band calculations @xcite @xcite and quantum oscillation measurements@xcite indicating a small negative gap causing the semimatal behavior .",
    "we comment below on the implications of our work for these controversies .",
    "the electronic structure of @xmath0 has been calculated @xcite @xcite .",
    "experiment , quantum chemical intuition and band calculations all agree that the @xmath2 @xmath3-shell is half filled and , as the scale relevant for electronic behavior , electronically inert .",
    "crystal field effects are negligible and to a good approximation , each @xmath2 may be regarded as carrying a @xmath4 `` core spin '' .",
    "band theory calculations @xcite reveal two near fermi surface bands : a nearly empty band with a minimum at x - point , derived mainly from @xmath5 , @xmath6 orbitals , and a nearly full band with a maximum at the x - point , derived mainly from @xmath7 , @xmath6 ones .",
    "the hybridization between these bands is negligible because they arise from different symmetry orbitals .    because we shall be interested in low energies and weak couplings , we expand the bands near the x - point so the minimal model describing @xmath0 becomes : @xmath8 here @xmath9 represents the @xmath4 @xmath2 core spin , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent upper ( conduction ) and lower ( valence ) bands and @xmath12 controls the band overlap .",
    "we take @xmath13 , absorbing the actual magnitude into the coupling @xmath14 .",
    "because @xmath9 originates from a filled ( spin polarized ) @xmath2 shell , and the latest band structure calculation @xcite shows that two bands arises from different @xmath2 orbitals ( @xmath3 and @xmath15 ) , we may therefore take @xmath14 to be diagonal in orbital indices",
    ". the high spin and low carrier density means the kondo effect is irrelevant , so the sign of @xmath14 is arbitrary .",
    "kunes and pickett s calculation @xcite implies @xmath16 ( kondo coupling ) and @xmath17 ( anti - kondo coupling ) and indicates that the splitting of the conduction and valence bands are roughly the same , we choose @xmath18 .",
    "our results turn out to depend mainly on @xmath19 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath20 is determined by the neutrality of the system , i.e. number of particles equals number of holes .",
    "fig([fig : band ] ) shows the simplified band structure implied by eqn([eqn : h ] ) .     with momentum @xmath21 measured from @xmath22 [ @xmath23 , in units of inverse lattice constant @xmath24 .",
    "curved ( flat ) dashed line represents valence ( defect ) band and heavy line conduction band.,width=288 ]    the model described in eqn([eqn : h ] ) can be easily modified to match the bandstructure implied by the photoemission experiment@xcite as follows : we interpret the lower band ( @xmath11 ) as arising from defect states which in this picture must exist so that carriers are donated to the conduction band , and thus take @xmath25 to be infinite , and assure there is no coupling between @xmath11 band and the core spin @xmath9 ( @xmath26 ) . at these parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath26 ) , the @xmath11 band serves as a particle reservoir and the chemical potential is fixed at 0 .",
    "this choice in fact does not change the structure of the phase diagram or the qualitative features of our results .",
    "the @xmath28 phase diagram is straightforward .",
    "the ground state is ferromagnetic . if @xmath29 , the majority spin of band 1 crosses the minority spin of band 2 , which results in metallic behavior . if not , the ground state is insulating . at @xmath30 ,",
    "the random spin orientations mean that the band shift are much less ( especially at small @xmath14 ) .",
    "roughly , @xmath31 implies metallic behavior while @xmath32 implies insulating state .",
    "to study eqn([eqn : h ] ) , we use the single site dynamical mean field method @xcite",
    ". this amounts to assuming that the electron self energy is momentum independent : @xmath33 .",

    "the free energy so determined is a functional of the applied field @xmath40 and the system magnetization is given by @xmath41 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to perform a legendre transformation to obtain @xmath42 .",
    "we have not found an efficient method for performing this transformation : to obtain @xmath42 , we solve the dynamical mean field equations numerically for a range of @xmath40 , and then construct @xmath43 explicitly .",
    "we note however that in some parameter ranges , the dmft equations have two stable ( symmetry un - related ) solutions at @xmath44 , corresponding to states with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the two states so determined are extrema of @xmath42 and their free energies are the extremal values of @xmath42 , so first order transition points may be located without constructing @xmath42 explicitly .",
    "we have solved the dynamical mean field equations corresponding to extremizing eqn([eqn : latfreeenergy ] ) with respect to @xmath47 . for simplicity",
    "we adopted a semicircular density of states @xmath48 with @xmath49 chosen to match the band theory band - edge density of states .",
    "we also assumed @xmath50 ( because this is the limit relevent for the materials of interest ) and @xmath51 ( we will see below that the calculated transition temperature is much less than @xmath14 ) .",
    "these approximations simplify calculations considerably , in particular , in this limit we may retain only the @xmath52 component of the core spin , simplifying the quantum trace .    to simplify the expression ,",
