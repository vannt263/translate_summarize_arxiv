    "in multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) communications , space - time coding techniques have emerged as a promising method for effectively utilizing the advantages of multi - antenna diversity . in particular , orthogonal space - time block codes ( ostbc ) have attracted considerable attention in recent literature ( for example @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) because of their maximal diversity gain , simple code construction , and low maximum - likelihood ( ml ) detection complexity when channel state information ( csi ) is available at the receiver . however , in some scenarios , perfect knowledge of csi may be not available at the receiver .",
    "for example , csi might be out - dated due to fast channel fading , or inaccurate if the pilot symbols are under attack .",
    "therefore , the request for blind ostbc detection with unknown csi arises .",
    "the blind detection algorithms have been investigated in the past few years . in @xcite , @xcite , a suboptimal algorithm called the cyclic ml",
    "was proposed .",
    "the idea behind is to decompose the difficult blind detection problem into several simpler subproblems , one of which is coherent ml detection problem .",
    "this cyclic ml method can solve the blind detection problem but the accuracy is not satisfactory in some scenarios . in @xcite-@xcite , semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) and sphere based blind ostbc decoding algorithms are proposed .",
    "the motivation of this type of approaches is to simplify the blind detection problem to a boolean quadratic program ( bqp ) and seek a suboptimal solution to bqp that guarantees polynomial - time worst - case complexity with respect to the data length .",
    "later on , a novel non - coherent ml ostbc blind detection algorithm is presented in @xcite which can be performed in polynomial time . while all these algorithms have improved performance of the blind detection with reasonable computational efficiency , there still exists a performance gap between them and the optimal ml decoder with csi .",
    "therefore , the development of blind detection of ostbc with both higher performance and lower complexity is needed .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of blind ostbc detection without any knowledge of csi at the receiver .",
    "particularly , to simplify the development of the algorithm , we focus our attention on blindly decoding alamouti code , which is the foundation of ostbcs . after introducing signal model in section [ sc : system model ] , in section [ sc : blind detection problem ]",
    "we first develop a core iterative least - squares ( ils ) algorithm to blindly detect symbols in alamouti codes .",
    "this ils algorithm has low computational complexity but may converge to unreliable solution . in an effort to improve detection performance , particularly for small sample size that pose the greatest challenge , in section [ sc : enhanced algorithm ] we propose an algorithmic upgrade referred to as enhanced ils ( e - ils ) .",
    "this proposed e - ils algorithm relies on statistical analysis of independent ils executions on the received data samples .",
    "the extensive simulation studies in section [ sc : simulation ] prove the efficiency of the proposed e - ils algorithm with blind detection performance approaching the optimal maximum - likelihood detector with known csi . finally , a few concluding remarks are drawn in section [ sc : conclusions ]",
