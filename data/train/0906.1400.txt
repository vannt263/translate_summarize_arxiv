    "the formation of planetary systems is intimately connected to the properties of the circumstellar disks in which they are born .",
    "most studies to date have focused on young disks in taurus - auriga and @xmath5 ophiuchus for their proximity .",
    "however , most stars do not form in relative isolation as in taurus and @xmath5 ophiuchus , but rather in dense , massive star clusters that produce ionizing radiation @xcite , which threatens the persistence of nearby circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "there is even clear evidence based on the presence of short - lived radionucleides , particularly @xmath6fe , in meteorites @xcite , which indicate our own solar system originated in a massive star forming environment @xcite .",
    "orion is the nearest young massive star forming region , and its favourable geometry due to a `` blister hii '' region aligned toward the sun has allowed over 200 young protoplanetary disks ( `` proplyds '' ) to be discovered in projection against the bright background nebula by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "the potential for the proplyds to form planetary systems depends on how much mass remains in the disks , in spite of the hostile environment .",
    "several millimeter interferometric surveys have been undertaken to determine the masses of these disks , but few proplyds were detected in excess of the ionized gas emission , which swamps the dust emission at centimeter to millimeter wavelengths @xcite . with its higher frequency observations ,",
    "the submillimeter array ( sma ) is more sensitive to dust - disk emission from the orion proplyds than any existing interferometer @xcite .",
    "the initial results of our sma survey of disk masses in the orion trapezium cluster revealed this region is missing the most massive disks found in taurus and @xmath5ophiuchus , most likely a result of photoevaporation by the most massive star of the cluster , @xmath7oric ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "photoevaporation rapidly erodes large and massive disks near o - stars , but at larger distances , the flux of ionizing radiation drops significantly and no longer influences the disks . using our observations , we searched for a disk mass dependence on distance from @xmath7oric , but did not find one .",
    "in order to explore the extent of the disk mass truncation in orion , we imaged two hst identified proplyds at larger distances from the trapezium cluster .    in this letter , we present our submillimeter observations of two hst - identified disks , 216 - 0939 and 253 - 1536 , located in the outskirts of the orion nebula ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these disks are seen in silhouette and were discovered by @xcite .",
    "proplyd 216 - 0939 is a 2.6@xmath8 flared disk surrounding a @xmath9 star ( hillenbrand 1997 ) , while proplyd 253 - 1536 is a suspected binary system @xcite , with a disk surrounding the apparently fainter companion .",
    "both disks lie many arcminutes ( @xmath11-pc ) north of the trapezium cluster ( see figure 1 ) , well away from the ionizing radiation of @xmath7 ori c. the sma observations are described in section  2 , followed by our determination of disk masses in section  3 .",
    "we discuss the implications of our observations for planet formation in orion in section  4 .",
    "submillimeter interferometric observations at @xmath0 m were conducted with the submillimeter array ( sma ) in its compact configuration on 2008 dec 23 and 2008 dec 24 on mauna kea towards disks 216 - 0939 and 253 - 1536 . in this arrangement ,",
    "the sma s eight 6-m antennas provide a maximum baseline of 70-m .",
    "additional observations of 253 - 1536 were obtained on 2009 march 26 and 27 using the very extended ( vex ) configuration , which provides baselines up to 508-m .",
    "double sideband receivers were tuned to an intermediate frequency ( if ) of 340.175 ghz .",
    "each sideband provides 2ghz of bandwidth , separated by @xmath105ghz from the if .",
    "we simultaneously observed the co(32 ) transition , which was strongly detected but maps show any line emission from the disk is substantially contaminated by confusion with the more extended molecular cloud background .",
    "weather conditions for the observations were good , with @xmath113-mm precipitable water vapor , resulting in system temperatures ranging from 100 - 400k .",
    "the raw visibilities for each night were calibrated and edited using the mir software package . the phase and amplitudes",
    "were monitored with 5 minute integrations of two quasars ( j0423013 and j0530 + 135 ) , which were interleaved with 20 minute on - source integrations .",
    "passband calibration was conducted with the bright quasar 3c273 and uranus was used to set the absolute flux scale , which is accurate to @xmath12 10% .",
    "the calibrated visibilities were weighted by system temperature and inverted , then deconvolved to generate continuum maps using the miriad software package .",
    "co(32 ) was edited out of the @xmath13 m observations to generate a line - free continuum , which was used to produce the final maps shown in figure 2 .",
    "images were created for uv - spacings greater than 27k@xmath14 , or physical baselines longer than 23-m , to filter out uniform extended emission greater than 7.5@xmath15 in size , larger than resolved hst disk sizes .",
    "the map of 216 - 0939 was made with only compact array observations , so longer baseline data was weighted higher ( super - uniform weighting ) in order to maximize the resolution to get a circular @xmath16 beam .",
    "the map of 253 - 1536 combined the compact and vex sma observations .",
    "the addition of vex observations to the compact configuration data significantly improved the beam size from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the improvement in resolution allowed us to resolve and distinguish disk emission from each source in the binary , and we label the primary and secondary disks 253 - 1536a and 253 - 1536b , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0 m continuum images of proplyds 216 - 0939 and 253 - 1536 alongside their discovery hst h@xmath19 images taken from @xcite .",
    "all three disks were very strongly detected , and their integrated flux densities are listed in table 1 .    as the silhouette disks show no signs of being photoevaporated , the free - free emission from ionized gas emission is not expected to be significant .",
    "the disks lie in regions where the molecular cloud emission is lower and more uniform than for the central trapezium cluster surveyed in paper i. bolometer maps made with the scuba camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope by @xcite were used to correct background emission in a similar way to paper i. the background was found to contribute @xmath201mjy@xmath21 to the disk fluxes , much less than calibration errors . therefore , since both the ionized gas and background molecular cloud emission are negligible , the @xmath0 m fluxes arise entirely from the dust - disks and unlike paper i , we do not make any corrections .",
    "the disk masses were derived from the dust fluxes using the standard relationship from @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23pc is the distance to orion @xcite , @xmath24 is the dust grain opacity with an implicit gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100:1 , and @xmath25 is the planck function .",
    "a dust temperature of @xmath26k was used , which is the average for disks in taurus - auriga and @xmath5ophiuchus @xcite .",
    "we used the same temperature and opacity as these disk surveys and also of orion @xcite for consistency .",
    "the resulting disk masses are @xmath2 for proplyd 216 - 0939 , @xmath3 for 253 - 1536a and @xmath4 for 253 - 1536b ( see table 1 ) . both 216 - 0939 and 253 - 1536a , are more massive than the upper limit of @xmath27 found for the orion trapezium cluster proplyds in paper i.    lcccccr 216 - 0939 & 91.9 & 1.3 & 4.50 @xmath10 0.06 & 291 & k5 + 253 - 1536a & 134.2 & 1.0 & 6.62 @xmath10 0.13 & 282 & unknown + 253 - 1536b & 37.5 & 1.0 & 1.84 @xmath10 0.04 & @xmath1160 & m2.5 +    both disks 216 - 0939 and 253 - 1536a are resolved .",
    "an elliptical gaussian fit to the visibilities gives a size of @xmath28 at a position angle of @xmath29 ( measured east of north ) for disk 216 - 0939 , which corresponds to a disk radius of @xmath30au and inclination @xmath1280@xmath31 .",
    "the fit to disk 253 - 1536a gives a size of @xmath32 at a position angle of 73@xmath31 , corresponding to a radius of 280au and inclination of @xmath1265@xmath31 .",
    "the secondary disk , 253 - 1536b , is unresolved , implying a radius @xmath1160au .",
    "we found in paper i that the disk mass distribution in the trapezium cluster is truncated , with a lack of massive disks ( m@xmath33 ) relative to taurus and @xmath5ophiuchus .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the relatively low disk luminosities in the center of the trapezium cluster can not be due to heating from the o stars because that would operate in the opposite way to produce higher submillimeter fluxes for a given dust mass .",
    "the dust opacity in disks is unknown and a lower value in the trapezium cluster disks , due to substantial grain growth , might explain the discrepancy@xcite .",
    "however , given that the cluster disks tend to have smaller sizes than the massive taurus disks and the objects in this letter , a more reasonable interpretation for the truncation of the trapezium cluster disk mass distribution is the loss of the outer edges of the largest disks due to photoevaporation .",
    "our finding here , of more massive disks beyond the trapezium cluster , reinforces this interpretation .",
    "proplyds 216 - 0939 and 253 - 1536 show no signs of photoevaporation and are similar in size and mass to the largest disks seen in taurus .",
    "stellar encounters are much more common in the trapezium cluster than in the more sparsely populated lower mass star forming regions .",
    "although @xcite found that they are an insignificant factor in disk destruction at the 1 - 2myr age of the cluster , @xcite reasoned otherwise based on more detailed modeling of the disk - disk interaction and considering encounters with massive stars .",
    "our disk mass measurements provide an important constraint on these theories .",
    "the most massive disk we have measured here , @xmath3 , is almost twice that of the most massive disk we observed in the trapezium cluster , @xmath27 .",
    "if this discrepancy were only due to stellar encounters , it would require not only a close encounter but also a high stellar mass ratio : @xmath34au for @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "yet , these same conditions imply a very high photoevaporative loss rate due to an o star .",
    "the low disk masses within the trapezium cluster together with the high disk masses at larger distances firmly establish photoevaporation as the dominant disk erosive agent .",
    "counting 216 - 0939 and the two resolved disks in the binary 253 - 1536 , we have measured the masses of three disks .",
    "unless they have very flat surface density profiles , all satisfy the mass and size requirement to form a planetary system on the scale of our own ; m@xmath36 within 60 au ( paper i ) .",
    "@xcite stated that the @xmath0 m emission may become optically thick in such compact disks .",
    "but for the @xcite dust opacity we have used here , @xmath37 , where the average surface density , @xmath38 g@xmath39 , for a face - on disk with m=@xmath40 and r=60au .",
    "the innermost regions may be optically thicker if the surface density strongly increases and @xmath41 may approach unity for edge - on disks such as 216 - 0939 but we did not see a correlation between flux and disk orientation in paper i and believe that our observations are a good measure of the amount of small grains in the disks .",
    "there may well be undetected centimeter - sized and larger particles in the proplyds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these massive silhouette disks at large distances from @xmath7oric have no detectable free - free emission at the mjy level and are good candidates for longer wavelength observations to study the larger grain population .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , of course , that the main uncertainty in any mass estimate based on the dust continuum is the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the hst image of proplyd 253 - 1536a by @xcite shows that it is very large , classified as a `` giant '' , with a radius @xmath42au .",
    "a neighboring star lies only @xmath43 ( 440au ) away , with a low probability ( @xmath112% ; @xcite ) of chance alignment .",
    "our sma observations reveal substantial dusty disks around both stars with masses of 0.066@xmath44 and 0.018@xmath44 . there is no evidence for any circumbinary material in the hst or sma data , which is not surprising given the large separation .",
    "binary stars are important , not only because they make up a significant fraction of stars in the orion nebula @xcite but also because at least 20% of extra - solar planet discoveries are hosted by binary star systems @xcite .",
    "however , millimeter wavelength detections of binary protostars in taurus - auriga @xcite and @xmath5ophiuchus @xcite generally find disks only around the primary stars .",
    "this agrees well with numerical models of core fragmentation which predict a higher disk mass around the more massive star @xcite .",
    "@xcite found massive disks @xmath45 0.01 - 0.05@xmath44 toward each of the binary protostars in l1551 , the range due to the uncertain contribution from free - free emission at the long 7-mm wavelength of the observations .",
    "these are deeply embedded class 0 protostars , however , with substantial circumstellar material and no clear dividing line between envelope and disks . @xcite",
    "detected two disks in the hk tau binary system but with low masses , @xmath46 .",
    "the binary proplyd 253 - 1536 stands out as the first example of two optically visible stars each with sufficient mass to form a solar system their separation , @xmath47 440 au in projection , is large enough that both the evolution of the disks and their prospects for planet formation can be considered independently of each other @xcite .    the discovery of this binary disk system was serendipitous .",
    "the disk around the optically brighter member of 253 - 1536 is too small to be seen in the glare of the star in the hst data .",
    "optical images reveal the presence of similarly sized disks in the trapezium cluster only through the presence of their photoevaporative tails .",
    "if the 253 - 1536 system was closer to the cluster center , both disks would be more apparent .",
    "there are probably many other more small disks in orion that are not being photoevaporated and therefore not being detected by hst imaging .    the optically fainter star , 253 - 1536a has the larger and more massive disk .",
    "it is spatially resolved in both the hst and sma data .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to meaningly constrain the surface density profile without knowledge of the mid- and far - infrared spectral energy distribution .",
    "@xcite noted that the disk silhouette appeared slightly de - centered from the stellar position .",
    "the effect would be at the limit of the sma resolution but is not seen .",
    "the position angle of the disk in the hst image also appears slightly smaller than the sma image .",
    "these differences are probably due to lower density material that absorbs optical light but emits little in the submillimeter .",
    "we speculate that an asymmetric flaring of the disk , such as seen in 216 - 0939 , could produce this effect .    as a binary system , the two circumstellar disks in 253 - 1536 formed at the same time .",
    "yet they have quite different masses and radii .",
    "the stellar masses play a large role in the initial disk conditions and subsequent evolution .",
    "@xcite noted that the hk tau binary has a stellar mass ratio close to unity and that other binaries with disk detections only around the primary had higher mass ratios .",
    "although the optically brighter star 253 - 1535b is known to be of spectral type m2.5 ( hillenbrand 1997 ) , the spectral type of 253 - 1535a with the larger disk , is unknown .",
    "it is fainter by a factor of 40 in h@xmath19 @xcite , by a factor of 6 at @xmath48 m @xcite and a factor of 1.7 at @xmath49 m @xcite .",
    "the nearly edge - on disk obscures a considerable fraction of the light at these wavelengths , however , and a spectrum is required for definitive typing and to determine the stellar mass ratio in this system . with this information",
    ", this system will be an important benchmark for comparison with theories of disk formation and early evolution .",
    "we have detected strong @xmath0 m emission from two silhouette disks in m43 , just north of the orion trapezium cluster .",
    "the implied disk masses , 0.045@xmath44 and 0.066@xmath44 , are the largest yet discovered in this massive star forming region and strengthen our conclusion from paper i that orion disks likely had similar initial properties to those in the lower mass and less crowded taurus - auriga and @xmath5ophiuchus regions .",
    "we have also found that each star in the binary system 253 - 1536 possesses its own disk .",
    "only the larger disk is visible in hst images but our sma data , at comparable 0.2@xmath15 resolution , reveal a 0.018@xmath44 disk around the optically brighter star . both disks in this binary have sufficient mass within 60 au radius to form planetary systems on the scale of our own but their different masses and sizes demonstrate that the disks may have formed with quite different initial conditions or that their evolution is strongly dependent on additional parameters than time alone .",
    "our sma survey of circumstellar disks in orion both in and beyond the trapezium cluster shows that about half the mass can be lost in the outer edges of disks around stars within 0.2-pc of @xmath7oric but large , massive disks can survive beyond 1-pc .",
    "further observations of a statistically representative sample of disks at intermediate distances are necessary to determine the sphere of influence of this o6 star more precisely .",
    "additional observations are also required to better characterize the upper end of the orion disk mass distribution .",
    "finally , the high disk masses that we have observed would be detectable out to 2-kpc and suggest that studies of other hii regions could be fruitful .",
