    "elzerman @xcite have reported the usage of gate - voltage pulses for a single - shot readout of the spin configuration of a single - electron transistor in a finite magnetic field . such a system can be modeled by an anderson impurity model @xcite coupled to a noninteracting metallic host .",
    "while the normal single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) has a well - established and rather simple phase diagram @xcite , it can be viewed as a special case ( @xmath1 ) of a more general class of models @xcite whose coupling function @xmath2 to the local impurity contains a pseudogap ; @xmath3 .",

    "we employ a recent extension of wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite to the nonequilibrium quench dynamics , the time - dependent nrg ( td - nrg ) @xcite .",
    "while the quench dynamics in the siam ( @xmath1 ) has been investigated @xcite using the td - nrg , the non - equilibrium dynamics in the pg - siam within and across the qcp has only recently been addressed by a time - dependent gutzwiller ansatz @xcite . using this extension of the well - established variational gutzwiller technique @xcite to nonequilibrium @xcite",
    "it has been demonstrated that the pseudogap coupling function can yield nontrivial dynamics as a consequence of the diverse low - energy fixed points of the model @xcite .",
    "the pg - siam has been extensively investigated in the context of kondo impurities in unconventional superconductors @xcite or in the context of defects in graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "some of the low - energy properties of the fixed points have been worked out in detail @xcite and it has been shown that the universality class of the fixed point changes with the coupling function exponent @xmath5 .",
    "one intriguing property of this model is the absence of the kondo screening at low coupling strength @xcite while for a large coupling a sc fixed point is found but with an only partially screened moment for particle - hole symmetric models .",
    "the question arises how these orthogonal ground states of the different phases influence the real - time dynamics of a system driven out of equilibrium by a quantum quench .    since an effective spin degree of freedom decouples from the impurity in the lm phase , this fixed point",
    "( fp ) property is expected to have a strong influence on the steady - state formation and the thermalization when quenched into the lm phase .",
    "we will show , however , that an oversimplified picture does not hold and requires some modification .    in all our quenches",
    "we find a well - defined steady state at long times .",
    "the distance from the thermal equilibrium for the same final hamiltonian serves as a measure for the degree of thermalization . while for quenches within the sc phase ,",
    "the system thermalizes within the numerical accuracy of the td - nrg @xcite , the deviations from the thermal equilibrium remain negligible even for quenches across the qcp very close to the qcp .",
    "the deviation appears to be a continuous function of the distance to the critical coupling .",
    "the surprising finding of a well - defined steady state even for quenches across the qcp into the lm phase can be understood in terms of the known fixed point properties of the model .",
    "it has been already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the local thermodynamic properties such as double occupancy as well as the fractional local moment on the impurity are continuous across the qcp .    in the strong - coupling ( sc ) phase",
    ", the kondo temperature @xmath8 governing the excitations around the sc fp vanishes at the qcp and increases with increasing coupling to the pseudogap metallic host .",
    "the crossover scale @xmath9 taking the role of @xmath8 in the lm phase characterizes the excitations around the lm fp , decreases with increasing coupling and also vanishes at the qcp",
    ".    the associated length scales @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ",
    "@xmath12 being the average fermi velocity of the host material  can be interpreted as estimate for the spatial extension of the decoupled local moment ( or the kondo singlet in the sc phase . ) only for a very large local coulomb repulsion @xmath13 , the crossover scale @xmath9 becomes large indicating that the local moment is mainly formed closely to or on the impurity .",
    "bearing in mind these known equilibrium properties @xcite of the model it becomes apparent that an ansatz for the ground state restricted to a local moment formation on the impurity site only , as used in the gutzwiller approach @xcite , significantly underestimates the critical coupling @xmath7 .",
    "then , the local moment formation can only occur in such an approach at much lower coupling @xmath14 or much larger local coulomb repulsion @xmath13 compared to the solution provided by the nrg .",
    "this has also a profound consequence for the observed real - time dynamics .",
    "due to the extended nature of the decoupled local moment , the local observable still can explore a larger phase space of itinerant states and , therefore , shows signs of thermalization close to the qcp .    reducing the size of the local moment by increasing @xmath13 away from the critical @xmath15 will still yield a steady state whose asymptotic properties start to deviate significantly from the thermal expectation values : due to the increase of the nondecaying fraction of the expectation value @xcite the difference between the steady - state and the thermal expectation value increases in the lm phase .",
    "this difference , however , will strongly depend on the matrix element of the operator with the decoupling degree of freedom ( dof ) . while for the local double occupancy as a measure for the local correlations we find an increasing deviation between the long - time steady - state value and the thermal expectation value , the energy flow into the hybridization energy seems to be unaffected when crossing over to the localized regime .",
    "it is a rather surprising finding that hybridization energy shows thermalization even in the lm phase , although it has been conjectured that the td - nrg might have problems in describing properly the energy flow @xcite .",
