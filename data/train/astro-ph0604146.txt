    "stars in nature are usually rotating and may be subject to non - axisymmetric rotational instabilities .",
    "an analytically exact treatment of these instabilities in linearized theory exists only for incompressible equilibrium fluids in newtonian gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . for these configurations",
    ", global rotational instabilities may arise from non - radial toroidal modes @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle ) .    for sufficiently rapid rotation ,",
    "the @xmath6 bar mode becomes either _ secularly _ or _ dynamically _ unstable .",
    "the onset of instability can typically be marked by a critical value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath2 the gravitational potential energy .",
    "uniformly rotating , incompressible stars in newtonian theory are secularly unstable to bar - mode formation when @xmath8 .",
    "this instability can grow only in the presence of some dissipative mechanism , like viscosity or gravitational radiation , and the associated growth time - scale is the dissipative time - scale , which is usually much longer than the dynamical time - scale of the system .",
    "by contrast , a dynamical instability to bar formation sets in when @xmath9 .",
    "this instability is present independent of any dissipative mechanism , and the growth time is the hydrodynamic time - scale .",
    "in addition to the classical dynamical instability mentioned above , there have been several studies indicating that a dynamical instability of the rotating stars occurs at low @xmath0 , which is far below the classical criterion of dynamical instability in newtonian gravity .",
    "@xcite find in the self - gravitating ring and tori that an @xmath6 dynamical instability occurs around @xmath10 in the lowest case in the centrally condensed configurations . for rotating stellar models",
    ", @xcite find that @xmath6 dynamical instability occurs around @xmath11 for a high degree ( @xmath12 ) of differential rotation .",
    "note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the angular velocity at the centre and at the equatorial surface , respectively .",
    "@xcite found dynamical @xmath15 instability around @xmath16 in the @xmath17 polytropic `` toroidal '' star with a high degree ( @xmath18 ) of differential rotation , and @xcite extended the results of dynamical @xmath15 instability to the cases with polytropic index @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "computation of the onset of the dynamical instability , as well as the subsequent evolution of an unstable star , performed in a fully nonlinear hydrodynamic simulation in newtonian gravity have shown that @xmath21 depends only very weakly on the stiffness of the equation of state .",
    "once a bar has developed , the formation of a two - arm spiral plays an important role in redistributing the angular momentum and forming a core - halo structure .",
    "@xmath21 are smaller for stars with high degree of differential rotation @xcite",
    ". simulations in relativistic gravitation @xcite have shown that @xmath21 decreases with the compaction of the star , indicating that relativistic gravitation enhances the bar mode instability .",
    "one of the remarkable features of these low @xmath0 instabilities is an appearance of the corotation modes .",
    "as it is pointed out by @xcite the low @xmath0 unstable oscillation of bar - typed one found by @xcite has a corotation point . here",
    "corotation means the pattern speed of oscillation in the azimuthal direction coincides with a local rotational angular velocity of the star .",
    "it is well - known in the context of stellar or gaseous disk system that the corotation of oscillation may lead to instabilities .",
    "for instance , there have been several density wave models proposed to explain spiral pattern in galaxies , in which wave amplification at the corotation radius of spiral pattern is a key issue .",
    "another example of importance of corotation is found in the theory of thick disk ( torus ) around black holes",
    ". initiated by a discovery of a dynamical instability of geometrically thick disk by @xcite .",
    "instabilities of these systems are thought not to be unique in their origin and in their characteristics .",
    "some seem to be related to local shear of flow and to share a nature with kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "others may be related to corotation of oscillation modes with averaged flow on which the oscillation is present",
    ". the mechanisms of instabilities by corotation , however , seem not unique .",
    "as is reminiscent to `` landau amplification '' of plasma wave , a resonant interaction of corotating wave with the background flow ( in the case of landau amplification , background flow is that of charged particles ) may amplify the wave , by direct pumping of energy from background flow to the oscillation .",
    "the other may be an overreflection of waves at the corotation which may be seen in waves propagating towards shear layer .",
    "the main purpose of this paper , in contrast to the preceding studies of this issue , is to investigate the nature of low @xmath0 dynamical instabilities , especially to study the qualitative difference of them from the classical bar instability .",
    "as is mentioned above , recent studies have shown that dynamical instabilities are possible for different region of the parameter space of rotating stars . observing the existence of dynamical instabilities whose critical @xmath0 value are well below the classical criterion of bar instability , it is natural to raise a question on whether these two types ,",
    "`` high @xmath0 '' and `` low @xmath0 '' , of dynamical instability are categorized in the same type of dynamical instability or not .",
    "our study is done with both eigenmode analysis and hydrodynamical analysis .",
    "a non - linear hydrodynamical simulation is indispensable for investigation of evolutionary process and final outcome of instability , such as bar formation and spiral structure formation .",
    "the nature of instability as a source of gravitational wave , which interests us most , is only accessible through non - linear hydrodynamical computations . on the other hand ,",
    "a linear eigenmode analysis is in general easier to approach the dynamical instability of a given equilibrium and it may be helpful to have physical insight on the mechanism and the origin of the instability .",
    "therefore , a linear eigenmode analysis and a non - linear simulation are complementary to each other and they both help us to understand the nature of dynamical instability .    as a simplified system mimicking the physical nature of the differentially rotating fluid , we choose to study self - gravitating cylinder models .",
    "they have been used to study general dynamical nature of such gaseous masses as stars , accretion disks and of stellar system as galaxies .",
    "although there is no infinite - length cylinder in the real world , it is expected to share some qualitative similarities with realistic astrophysical objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . especially it has served as a useful model to investigate secular and dynamical instabilities of rotating masses .",
    "these works took advantage of a simple configuration of a cylinder compared with a spheroid .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section : dynamical instabilities in differentially rotating stars , we present our hydrodynamical results of dynamical one - armed spiral and dynamical bar instabilities .",
    "we present our diagnosis of dynamical @xmath15 and @xmath6 instabilities by using a canonical angular momentum in the section : canonical angular momentum to diagnose dynamical instability , and summarize our findings in the section : summary and discussion . throughout this paper",
    "we use gravitational units with @xmath22 .",
    "latin indices run over spatial coordinates .",
    "a more detailed discussion is presented in @xcite .",
    "we explain three types of dynamical instabilities in differentially rotating stars based on non - linear hydrodynamical computations . we assume a polytropic equation of state only to construct an equilibrium star as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a pressure , @xmath25 a rest - mass density , @xmath26 a constant , @xmath27 the polytropic index .",
    "we also assume the `` @xmath28-constant '' rotation law , which has an exact meaning in the limit of @xmath29 , of the rotating stars @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angular velocity , @xmath32 a constant parameter with units of specific angular momentum , and @xmath33 the cylindrical radius .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 determines the length scale over which @xmath31 changes ; uniform rotation is achieved in the limit @xmath35 , with keeping the ratio @xmath36 finite .",
    "we choose the same data sets as @xcite for investigating low @xmath0 dynamical instabilities in differentially rotating stars ( models i and ii in table  [ tab : initial ] corresponds to tables ii and i of @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "we also construct an equilibrium star with weak differential rotation in high @xmath0 , which excites the standard dynamical bar instability , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the characteristic parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : initial ] .",
    ".three differentially rotating equilibrium stars that trigger dynamical instability [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we adopt the method of canonical angular momentum to the nonlinear hydrodynamics . we identify the complex eigenfrequency and the corotation radius from dipole or quadrupole diagnostics which is summarized in table [ tab : freq ] .",
    "note that we read off the eigenfrequency from those plots at the early stage of the evolution .",
    "the eulerian perturbed velocity is defined by subtracting the velocity at equilibrium from the velocity .",
    "the lagrangian displacement vector is extracted by using a linear formula for a dominant mode in each case .",
    "we show the snapshots of canonical angular momentum density in figure  [ fig : jc ] . since we determine the corotation radius using the extracted eigenfrequency and the angular velocity profile at equilibrium , the radius does not change throughout the evolution . for low @xmath0 dynamical instability ,",
    "the distribution of the canonical angular momentum drastically changes its sign around the corotation radius , and the maximum amount of canonical angular momentum density increases at the early stage of evolution .",
    "this means that the angular momentum flows inside the corotation radius in the evolution . on the other hand , for high @xmath0 dynamical instability ( panel  iii of figure  [ fig : jc ] ) , which may be regarded as a classical bar instability modified by differential rotation ,",
    "the distribution of the canonical angular momentum is smooth and with no particular feature .",
    "note that the amplitude of @xmath37 is orders of magnitude smaller than those in the corotating cases in top and middle panels of figure  [ fig : jc ] .",
    "contrary to the linear perturbation analysis , the amplitude here is not scale free and the relative amplitude has a physical meaning .",
    "thus the smallness of it for model  iii suggest that it should be exactly zero everywhere in the limit of linearized oscillation .",
    "the deviation from zero may come from the imperfect assumption of linearized oscillation , that is made here to extract oscillation frequency and lagrangian displacement vector .    from these different behaviours of the distribution of the canonical angular momentum ,",
    "we find that the mechanisms working in the low @xmath0 instabilities and the classical bar instability may be quite different , i.e. , in the former the corotation resonance of modes are essential , while the instability is global in the latter case .",
    "we have studied the nature of three different types of dynamical instability in differentially rotating stars both in linear eigenmode analysis and in hydrodynamic simulation using canonical angular momentum distribution .",
    "we have found that the low @xmath0 dynamical instability occurs around the corotation radius of the star by investigating the distribution of the canonical angular momentum .",
    "we have also found by investigating the canonical angular momentum that the instability grows through the inflow of the angular momentum inside the corotation radius .",
    "the feature also holds for the dynamical bar instability in low @xmath0 , which is in clear contrast to that of classical dynamical bar instability in high @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the existence of corotation point inside the star plays a significant role of exciting one - armed spiral mode and bar mode dynamically in low @xmath0 .",
    "however , we made our statement from the behaviour of the canonical angular momentum , the statement holds only in a sense of necessary condition . in order to understand the physical mechanism of the low @xmath0 dynamical instability",
    ", we need another tool and it will be the next step of this study .",
    "the feature of gravitational waves generated from these instabilities are also compared .",
    "quasi - periodic gravitational waves emitted by stars with @xmath15 instabilities have smaller amplitudes than those emitted by stars unstable to the @xmath6 bar mode . for @xmath15 modes ,",
    "the gravitational radiation is emitted not directly by the primary mode itself , but by the @xmath6 secondary harmonic which is simultaneously excited .",
    "possibly this @xmath6 oscillation is generated through a quadratic nonlinear selfcoupling of @xmath15 eigenmode .",
    "remarkably the precedent studies @xcite found that the pattern speed of @xmath6 mode is almost the same as that of @xmath15 mode , which suggest the former is the harmonic of the latter . unlike the case for bar - unstable stars ,",
    "the gravitational wave signal does not persist for many periods , but instead is damped fairly rapidly .",
    "we have not understood this remarkable difference between @xmath15 and @xmath6 unstable cases .",
    "one of the possibility may be that the unstable @xmath15 eigenmode tends to couple to higher and higher @xmath38 modes ( which are not necessarily unstable and could be in the continuous spectrum ) and pump its energy to them in a cascade way .",
    "however , we have not found the feature that prevents @xmath6 mode from this cascade dissipation .",
    "another possibility is that the spiral pattern formed in @xmath15 instability redistributes the angular momentum of the original unstable flow , so that the flow is quickly stabilized . inside the corotation radius ,",
    "the background flow is faster than the pattern , while it is slower outside . a similar mechanism to landau damping in plasma wave which transfer the momentum of wave to background flow may work at the spiral pattern .",
    "the pattern may decelerate the background flow inside the corotation and accelerate it outside the corotation , which may change the unstable flow profile to stable one . as we do not see a spiral pattern forming in the low @xmath0 bar instability",
    ", it may eludes this damping process .",
