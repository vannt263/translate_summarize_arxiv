    "the existence of @xmath2-mesic nucleus , a bound state of @xmath2 meson in a nucleus , was first predicted by us in 1986  @xcite .",
    "the formation of such bound systems is caused by the attractive interaction between the @xmath2 meson and all the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the attractive nature of the interaction followed naturally from the work of bhalerao and liu  @xcite who found , from a detailed coupled - channel analysis of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 reactions , that near - threshold @xmath3 interaction is attractive . we can easily understand this attraction by observing that the @xmath3 threshold is situated just below the @xmath7 resonance . however , the attraction given in ref.@xcite is not strong enough to support a bound state in nuclei with mass number @xmath8 .",
    "this latter conclusion@xcite was confirmed by li et al .",
    "@xcite , who used a standard green s function technique of many - body theory to study the formation of @xmath2-mesic nuclei . before proceeding further",
    ", we would like to mention that in the literature the @xmath2-nucleus bound states are also called @xmath2-nucleus quasibound states .",
    "this is because these bound states have a finite width and they eventually decay . in this work",
    ", we shall simply call them bound states .",
    "if the existence of @xmath2-mesic nucleus is experimentally confirmed , many new studies of nuclear and particle physics will become possible .",
    "for example , because the binding energies of @xmath2 meson depend strongly on the coupling between the @xmath3 and the @xmath7 channels  @xcite , studies of @xmath2-mesic nucleus can yield additional information on the @xmath9 coupling constant involving bound nucleons .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath2-mesic nuclear levels correspond to an excitation energy of @xmath10 mev , to be compared with an excitation energy of @xmath11 mev associated with the @xmath12- and @xmath13-hypernuclei .",
    "the existence of nuclear bound states with such high excitation energies provides the possibility of studying nuclear structure far from equilibrium .",
    "several experiments  @xcite using @xmath14 beam , as motivated by the theoretical works of refs .",
    "@xcite , were performed to search for @xmath2-mesic nuclei .",
    "while these experiments could not confirm the existence of @xmath2-mesic nucleus , they did not rule out such possibility either .",
    "more recently , sokol et al .",
    "@xcite have claimed observing the @xmath2-mesic nucleus @xmath15c through measuring the invariant mass of correlated @xmath16 pairs in a photo - mesonic reaction .",
    "further confirmation of their experimental result , with improved statistics , is needed before arriving at a definite conclusion .",
    "the existence of these @xmath2-mesic nuclear states depends on the value of the @xmath3 scattering length @xmath17 .",
    "( for the scattering length , we use the sign convention of goldberger and watson  @xcite . ) after 1990 , many theoretical models were proposed for @xmath3 interaction .",
    "fits to various data have yielded very different @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the real part of @xmath17 ranges from as low as 0.270  fm  @xcite to as high as 1.000  fm  @xcite , while the imaginary part varies between 0.190  fm  @xcite to 0.399  fm  @xcite .",
    "this wide range of values of @xmath17 are summarized in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "these very different values arise because @xmath17 is not directly measurable and must be inferred indirectly from other observables , such as the @xmath18 phase shifts . in this latter case ,",
    "the calculated @xmath17 depends strongly on the model used to relate the @xmath3 to the @xmath18 channels . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of both the @xmath7 and @xmath19 resonances leads to larger scattering lengths .",
    "however , this general rule does not account for all the reasons .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite the inclusion of both these @xmath20 resonances , but with fit to different reaction data , does not lead to a @xmath21 as high as @xmath22 fm rather only to a @xmath23 fm .",
    "we caution the readers that it is premature to conclude which published @xmath17 is the realistic one .",
    "such a determination can be made only after @xmath2-mesic nuclei are experimentally discovered , as only their experimental observation can set a stringent constraint on the in - medium scattering length and enable one to differentiate between different theoretical models .    using final - state - interaction ( fsi ) analysis ,",
    "several theoretical studies have suggested an @xmath24  fm and the possibility of the formation of bound @xmath2-nucleus states in light nuclei , such as @xmath25he  @xcite and deuteron  @xcite .",
    "we will revisit the fsi analysis in this work and show the limitation of the method . in spite of the fact that many predicted @xmath17 ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) are much larger than the one used in the above - mentioned fsi analysis , to this date there has been no direct observation of these bound states in light nuclei .",
    "consequently , we believe it is valuable to understand the current experimental situation by analyzing in detail the dynamics pertinent to the formation of @xmath2-mesic nucleus .    we have learned from studying pion - nucleus scattering that , because of the fermi motion and binding of the target nucleon , the pion - nucleon interaction in nuclei occurs at energies below its free - space value , i.e. , below the energy that the pion - nucleon system would have when the nucleon is unbound@xcite . as the above causes for the lowering of the interaction energy",
    "are also present in @xmath2-nucleus scattering , we believe that the @xmath2-nucleon interaction energy in @xmath2-mesic nucleus formation will occur below its free - space threshold and this subthreshold interaction can have important effects on the formation of @xmath2-nucleus bound states .",
    "this observation has motivated us to examine in this work the reliability of using the free - space @xmath3 information , such as the @xmath3 scattering length , to make predictions of the nuclear binding of the @xmath2 .    we will , therefore , study the dependence of @xmath2-nucleus bound - state formation on off - shell behavior of @xmath3 interaction in nuclei with @xmath26 through comparing three different theoretical approaches .",
    "they are : ( 1 ) a fully off - shell microscopic optical potential that uses an off - shell @xmath3 model ; ( 2 )  a factorization approximation ( fa ) to the preceeding microscopic potential , where an energy shift parameter is used to calculate the @xmath3 interaction at subthreshold energies ; and ( 3 ) an `` on - shell '' optical potential whose strength depends solely on the scattering length @xmath17 .",
    "the last approach has its root in the study of k- and @xmath27-mesic atoms  @xcite and is also extensively used in predicting @xmath2-mesic nuclei .",
    "finally , we mention that as the existence of @xmath2-mesic nucleus has not yet been experimentally confirmed with certainty , there is no data to be fitted . hence , all of our results as well as those of others are purely predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the important differences in their underlying reaction dynamics are outlined .",
    "results and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "as we shall see , for a given @xmath3 interaction model , the `` on - shell '' approach gives much stronger binding for @xmath2 than does the microscopic calculation , making evident the important effects of off - shell dynamics .",
    "we will further show that these effects are of very general nature and are independent of the specific unitary off - shell model used in the comparative study .",
    "the ramifications of off - shell effects on both experimental and theoretical studies of bound states of @xmath28 systems , particularly in systems with @xmath29 , are discussed . in view of the interest in the method of fsi , we also reexamine in more detail this method and its applications to the study of @xmath2-@xmath25he systems .",

    "details of the calculation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . as can be seen from the table , the binding energy increases as the nucleus becomes heavier . in addition , the number of nuclear orbital in which the @xmath2 is bound ( @xmath131 , etc . ) increases with increasing mass number @xmath132 .",
    "the reason for this trend is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that our microscopic calculation does not use on - shell scattering length as an input .",
    "we emphasize that the reason we use the off - shell model of ref.@xcite in our comparative analysis is because we have at our disposal the detailed unitary off - shell momenta and energy dependences of that model , which allow us to study the off - shell effects in the formation of @xmath2-nucleus bound - state .",
    "such off - shell information is not readily obtainable from other @xmath3 models , either because the models can not be extended to off - shell domain or because of the elaborate computation required to generate the needed off - shell @xmath133 , and @xmath134 dependences of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "fortunately , as we shall see later , the effects of off - shell dynamics on any reasonable off - shell model will be qualitatively similar .    in table",

    "[ table:2 ] and [ table:3 ] indicates that the fa results with @xmath136  mev are very close to the off - shell results .",
    "this value of @xmath114 is similar to the one found in pion - nucleus elastic scattering  @xcite and can be understood by noting that the average nuclear binding and fermi motion amount to about 30  mev downward shift  @xcite of the hadron - nucleon interaction energy @xmath134 .",
    "our full off - shell dynamical calculations indicate , therefore , that the @xmath3 interaction in @xmath2 bound state formation takes place at energies about 30 mev below the ( free - space ) threshold .",
    "the subthreshold nature of the hadron - nucleon interaction in a nucleus is also evident in @xmath137-mesic and @xmath27-mesic atoms .",
    "for example , although the free - space @xmath138 scattering length is repulsive , the effective @xmath138 scattering length needed to fit the @xmath137-mesic atom data is attractive@xcite .",
    "the sign change of the scattering length can be easily understood .",
    "indeed , one may note that the @xmath139 resonance is situated about 26 mev below the @xmath138 threshold@xcite . using a downward shift of 30 mev found in this work",
    ", we can see that the in - medium @xmath138 interaction occurs actually below the resonance .",
    "hence , an attraction arises ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] ) . in the @xmath27-mesic atom studies , a strong @xmath85-wave repulsion of the effective @xmath18 interaction",
    "is indicated by the data .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the free - space @xmath18 @xmath85-wave interaction where there is a near - perfect cancellation between the @xmath140 and @xmath141 scattering lengths .",
    "bhalerao and shakin@xcite showed that the strong @xmath85-wave repulsion is due to different energy dependences of the @xmath140 and @xmath141 interactions , which make the cancellation no longer near complete at subthreshold energies .",
    "the mesic - atom experiments , therefore , indicate unambiguously that in bound - state formation the hadron - nucleon interaction inside a nucleus occurs at subthreshold energies .",
    "the results of the `` on - shell '' optical potential [ eq.([eq:2.3.1 ] ) ] are given in table  [ table:4 ] for two different values of @xmath17 .",
    "the first one is the same one used for tables  [ table:2 ] and [ table:3 ] , the other is chosen from table  [ table:1 ] , such that it has an imaginary part very similar to the former one .",
    "the nuclear form factors are the same as those used in the fa calculations .",
    "for these two scattering lengths , no bound state can exist in @xmath142he . upon comparing the third column of table  [ table:4 ] with the off - shell calculation ( table  [ table:2 ] )",
    ", we can see that the `` on - shell '' approximation predicts more strongly bound @xmath2-mesic nuclei .",
    "also , as expected , the `` on - shell '' results for @xmath143  fm are similar to those of fa with @xmath144  mev .",
    "we further note from table  [ table:4 ] that the effect on decreasing the calculated nuclear binding energies as caused by the decrease in @xmath21 is not a linear function of the nuclear mass number @xmath132 . for light nuclei ( @xmath145 )",
    "a decrease of @xmath146 by a factor of @xmath147 causes @xmath0 to decrease by a factor greater than 10 .    while the in - medium @xmath3 interaction strength is a function of the off - shell variables @xmath148 , one can appreciate the main feature of the off - shell effects by considering only the @xmath134 , or the energy , dependence .",
    "our study of the three different optical potentials indicates that this strength decreases with energy .",
    "however , specific subthreshold energy dependence is model - dependent .",
    "we may define a phenomenological reduction factor @xmath149 by @xmath150 and introduce an effective in - medium scattering length by @xmath151 in the model of ref.@xcite , @xmath152 $ ] [ eqs.([eq:2.1.10 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.1.12])([eq:2.1.12c ] ) ] .",

    ", it was mentioned that at 20 and 30 mev below the threshold , @xmath159  fm and @xmath160  fm , respectively . upon comparing these values with @xmath161  fm given by that model at the threshold ,",
    "we see a reduction of more than 1/3 of the real part of @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath162 ) .",
    "it seems that higher is the @xmath21 at the threshold greater is the subthreshold reduction .",
    "we note that at 20 to 30 mev below the threshold , both models give an imaginary part of @xmath163 about @xmath164 fm .",
    "this is because the @xmath165 is related to the reaction channel . at the subthreshold region , the only reaction channels that the @xmath3 channel can couple to are the @xmath18 and @xmath99 channels which were taken into account by both the models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the real part of the effective scattering length is still very model dependent , though in lesser degree than at the threshold .",
    "because of this model dependence , it is not possible to guess the subthreshold reduction for the other models listed in table  [ table:1 ] for which the off - shell dependence can not be easily reconstructed from the corresponding publications .",
    "we conclude from the two models analyzed above that a substantial reduction of attractive strength , @xmath21 , must occur at subthreshold energies .",
    "this reduction in attractive strength is of very general nature as it is a direct consequence of the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "we recall that the attraction between the @xmath2 and nucleon at low energies arises because the @xmath3 threshold is situated below this resonance .",
    "however , as the energy shift @xmath114 becomes larger , the @xmath3 interaction energy moves farther downward away from the resonance .",
    "any reasonable off - shell model leads , therefore , to a reduced attraction .",
    "consequently , calculations making use of free - space scattering length ( corresponding to @xmath166 ) necessarily overestimate @xmath0 .",
    "because of the large sensitivity of the binding energies to @xmath2-nucleon interaction in light nuclei and because @xmath167 , many @xmath2-nucleus bound states in very light nuclei , as predicted by using some of the @xmath17 in table  [ table:1 ] , may not exist in real situation .",
    "we caution , therefore , against using `` on - shell '' ( or scattering - length ) prediction as guide for searching @xmath2-mesic nuclei .    in view of the existing interest in searching for @xmath2-nucleus bound states in light nuclear systems , we believe that it is informative to determine values of the `` minimal '' scattering length , @xmath168 , which represents the least value of an @xmath163 that can bind the @xmath2 into an @xmath169 nuclear orbital . clearly , the real and imaginary parts of this scattering length are not independent of each other .",
    "we fixed @xmath170 to 0.09  fm , as suggested by the two off - shell models discussed above , and searched for @xmath171 .",
    "the results for several light nuclei are given in table  [ table:5 ] .",
    "it is interesting to revisit the fsi analysis and to examine the results of refs .",
    "@xcite in the light of our findings .",

    "this requires that @xmath194 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath182he ) of ref.@xcite does not satisfy this inequality while the @xmath186he ) does .",
    "our optical - potential calculations have verified this , namely , with the @xmath17 used in ref.@xcite we have found that there is no bound state in @xmath142he but there is one in @xmath173he . in other words",
    ", @xmath195 is not a sufficient condition for having a bound state .",
    "consequently , in spite of the much greater slope of @xmath180 with respect to @xmath177 in the @xmath2-@xmath142he system @xcite , we conclude that there is no @xmath2-nuclear bound state in @xmath142he . for the same reason",
    ", @xmath2 can not be bound onto the deuteron because none of the various calculated @xmath196 of ref .",
    "@xcite can satisfy the condition @xmath197 . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of a bound state in @xmath173he remains a possibility .",
    "this possibility is , however , hampered by the fact that @xmath180 is insensitive to the sign of @xmath198 , as can be seen from eq.([eq:5.1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we have found an @xmath188 that has a positive real part and can equally describe the data . for example , with @xmath199 fm , we have obtained from our optical potential , eq.([eq:2.3.1 ] ) , an @xmath182he)= 2.10 + 2.88i fm which can well describe the @xmath142he data .",
    "similarly , a good representation of the @xmath173he data can be obtained with an @xmath186he ) @xmath200 fm by using @xmath201 fm .",
    "the quality of representation is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in both cases @xmath202 which corresponds to the situation where the interaction is attractive but not strong enough to support a bound state .",
    "hence , we have shown that fsi can also admit solutions corresponding to having no @xmath2 bound state .",
    "we emphasize that our above analysis does not imply our preference for weaker @xmath17 but rather to exemplify numerically that fsi can not provide a unique answer concerning the formation of bound state .    at this point ,",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "firstly , although we need different @xmath17 for @xmath142he and @xmath173he while in ref .",
    "@xcite only one @xmath17 was needed , our result is reasonable because it reflects the fact that the transition amplitudes @xmath178 in the two reactions may not be treated as @xmath177-independent and , thus , do not scale each other by a multiplicative constant . indeed , by using the two - step model of ref.@xcite , willis _",
    "et al._@xcite can not fit the data of @xmath203 for the @xmath2-@xmath142he and @xmath2-@xmath173he systems with the same @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , one may note that second - order @xmath2-nucleus optical potential is important in light nuclei .",
    "this potential is sensitive to the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath204 ) correlation which is very different in @xmath142he and @xmath173he , as evidenced by the fact that the matter densities derived from the measured charge densities of these two nuclei have spatial dependences that do not scale each other .",
    "inclusion of second - order optical potential will lead to different modifications of @xmath205he ) . consequently , when only first - order optical potential is used to generate the @xmath188 in fitting the data , the effective @xmath17 will be different . in a similar manner , the different @xmath204 correlations in the two helium nuclei also contribute to the nonscaling of the @xmath178 .",
    "indeed , many reaction processes contribute to the transition matrix element . an important subset of the processes are those that can not be approximated by the @xmath206 and @xmath207 @xmath208he doorway mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "this is because in these processes the intermediate pion interacts with two different nucleons that do not belong to the same deuteron cluster in the nucleus .",
    "hence , these processes depend strongly on @xmath204 correlations having momentum dependence that can not be obtained from using the deuteron wave function . the non - simple nature of @xmath178 is further exemplified by the work of santra and jain  @xcite , who can describe the @xmath2-@xmath142he data even without fsi when the exchanges of @xmath209 and other mesons are included in the calculation of @xmath178 . while we strongly believe that fsi must be taken into account , ref.@xcite",
    "does indicate that there are many more aspects of the dynamics left to be thoroughly investigated before a definitive conclusion could be drawn from the @xmath2-@xmath25he data .",
    "secondly , our use of @xmath210 = 0.09 fm is merely suggested by the 30-mev downward shift of the effective @xmath3 interaction energy , as has been discussed after eq.([eq:4.1.2 ] ) . with @xmath210= 0.09 fm ,",
    "the helium data constrain the real part of the effective scattering length to be between 0.16 and 0.30 fm .",
    "however , we emphasize that the value of 0.09 fm is model - dependent and it is important to see if different @xmath3 off - shell models would give a similar subthreshold value . consequently",
    ", our finding of repulsive scattering length for the helium systems should not be interpreted as if @xmath210=0.09 fm were the final answer , but rather as an example showing the nonuniqueness of the solution to the problem . in view of the many needed improvements in the modeling of the transition amplitude , searching a same repulsive effective @xmath17 for both data sets is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "one would certainly like to be able to use the @xmath2-@xmath25he data to obtain a more stringent constraint on the effective subthreshold @xmath3 interaction .",
    "however , we conclude from the above discussion that the currently used fsi analysis can not provide an unequivocal answer not only because there is no simple correspondence between the sign of @xmath198 and the existence of an @xmath2-nucleus bound state , but also because the assumption of a @xmath177-independent @xmath178 is uncertain .",
    "consequently , our main message is that one should not rely on using on - shell scattering length and that direct detection of bound states is necessary .",
    "finally , we have also examined effects of nuclear form factor on the binding of @xmath2 .",
    "the results for @xmath142he are presented in table  [ table:7 ] .",
    "an inspection of this last table indicates that the binding of @xmath2 is not very sensitive to the finer aspect of a realistic nuclear form factor .",
    "a similar situation has also been noted for @xmath173he .",
    "the binding energies and widths of the @xmath2 as given by using the 3-parameter fermi or the frosch form factor are close to each other .",
    "the most important effect on the formation of @xmath2-mesic nucleus is , therefore , from the subthreshold dynamics of the @xmath2n interaction .",
    "our study shows that calculated binding energies and widths of @xmath2-nucleus bound states strongly depend on the subthreshold dynamics of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "the results of mesic atoms and the present analysis indicate that the average @xmath3 interaction energy in mesic - nucleus formation is below the threshold .",
    "what matters for the bound - state formation is not the @xmath3 interaction at the threshold but the effective in - medium interaction .",
    "because the subthreshold behavior of @xmath3 interaction is very model dependent , we believe that it is useful for theorists to publish not only the @xmath2-nucleon scattering length @xmath17 , but also the corresponding subthreshold values as a function of @xmath114 . before the availability of this information , we suggest to look for bound states in nuclear systems much heavier than those indicated by on - shell scattering length .",
    "the fsi analysis represents an interesting approach . since the analysis by itself can not provide a definitive answer as to whether there is an attractive @xmath2-nucleus interaction strong enough to bind the @xmath2 , more direct measurements such as the one used in ref.@xcite are necessary",
    ".    the downward shift in the effective interaction energy can lead to a substantial reduction of the attraction of in - medium @xmath2-nucleon interaction with respect to its free - space value .",
    "consequently , predictions based upon using free - space @xmath3 scattering length inevitably overestimates the binding of @xmath2 .",
    "this overestimation of the binding , as revealed by this study , has never been taken into account in discussing @xmath2-nuclear bound states .",
    "one must bear this in mind when using the predictions given by such calculations as guide in searching for @xmath2-nucleus bound states .",
