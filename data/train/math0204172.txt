    "this gives rise to ask if this property can be generalized for a wider class of affine semigroup rings , probably in connection with a suitable combinatorial parametrization resulting from partitions of minimal generating sets ( also called `` semigroup gluings '' ) , decomposition theorems of dominating matrices or even from graph - theoretic objects ( like coloured paths etc ) , cf .",
