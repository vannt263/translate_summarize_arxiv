    "hw virginis systems are eclipsing subdwarf binaries with cool , low - mass companion .",
    "they are a very important group among the subdwarf binaries , as a combined spectroscopic and lightcurve analysis can determine the masses and radii of both stars .",
    "they are easily recognized from their very characteristic lightcurve with the prominent reflection effect resulting from the large temperature difference of both stars .",
    "the hemisphere of the cool companion facing the hot subdwarf is heated up .",
    "therefore the contribution of the companion to the light varies with the orbital phase and reaches its maximum shortly before the secondary eclipse , where almost the complete hot side of the companion can be seen , and its minimum in the primary eclipse , where only the cool side is visible .",
    "+ based on the lightcurve it is possible to distinguish between a low mass main sequence companion and a white dwarf , as a white dwarf does not show a reflection effect because of its small radius .",
    "therefore we started a photometric follow - up campaign of the hot subdwarf binaries selected in the course of the muchfuss project (;",
    "geier et al .",
    "these proceedings ) . for the photometric follow - up we used the bonn simultaneous camera ( busca , see @xcite ) at the 2.2 m telescope at the calar alto , which can observe in 4 bands simultaneously .",
    "we did not use any filters but instead the intrinsic transmission curve given by the beam splitter .",
    "for the spectroscopic analysis we used medium resolution spectra . to determine the radial velocity , a fit of gaussians , lorentzians and polynomials to the balmer and helium lines was performed . to derive the radial velocity curve ,",
    "sine curves were fitted to the radial velocities .",
    "the atmospheric parameters are determined by a fit of a grid of synthetic spectra , that was calculated using lte model atmospheres with solar metallicity and metal line blanketing @xcite , to the balmer and helium lines .",
    "+ for the lightcurve analysis we used moro ( see @xcite and @xcite for more information ) .",
    "as the lightcurve analysis involves 12 + 5n ( n is the number of lightcurves ) not independent parameters , a degeneracy in the solutions can be seen and a single solution can not be determined .",
    "therefore it is necessary to constrain as many parameters as possible from the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "moreover , several solutions are calculated for different fixed mass ratios , as the mass ratio can not be determined because of the degeneracy .",
    "j1920 was selected as a high priority target for the muchfuss project as it shows a significant radial velocity shift in the four sdss spectra , which were obtained within 1.5h .",
    "therefore we observed a 1.75 h lightcurve with busca , which showed a reflection effect .",
    "another lightcurve of the complete orbit revealed the grazing eclipses .",
    "hence we declared it a high priority target for spectroscopic follow - up and obtained 39 spectra with twin at the 3.5 m telescope at the calar alto and 11 spectra with isis at the william herschel telescope at the roques de los muchachos observatory in la palma .",
    "+ the radial velocity curve , which covers the whole orbit nicely , is shown in fig.[1920 ] .",
    "it gives a semiamplitude of 59.8 @xmath1 2.5 @xmath2 and a period of 0.169 d. the lightcurves in @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the best fit are also shown in fig .",
    "we used only two of the four lightcurves as the s / n in the other two bands is not high enough .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to determine the period of the system from the lightcurve as we have only one full orbit . until now only a solution for the canonical sdb mass ( 0.47 @xmath0 ) is being calculated .",
    "the results of the spectroscopic and photometric analysis are compiled in table [ result_1922 ] the companion is a late m dwarf with a mass of 0.116 @xmath0 , if the sdb has the canonical mass .    , and @xmath5 band is illustrated together with the lightcurve solution for a canonical sdb mass . ]",
    ".results of the spectroscopic and lightcurve analysis for j1920 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "fig . [ teff - logg ] shows the position of the hw virginis systems in the @xmath6 diagram .",
    "our two new systems have typical parameters for an hw virginis system .",
    "j1920 is more evolved and seems to leave the horizontal branch .",
    "it is obvious that all the hw virginis systems with two exceptions seem to have very similar atmospheric parameters .",
    "normally the hw virginis systems are found in photometric surveys due to there characteristic lightcurve .",
    "we pursue a different approach . as we are looking for hw virginis systems in a sample of radial velocity variable sdb stars ,",
    "it is possible for us to determine the fraction of reflection effect binaries in the short period sdb binaries .",
    "66 sdb binaries have been observed , 4 of them show a reflection effect and/or eclipses .",
    "this means about 6% of the companions are low mass main sequence stars .",
    "two of the companions are brown dwarfs , which means that we find about 3% of the sdb binaries have substellar companions ( see also geier et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
