    "more useful is analogue of eq .",
    "( [ hs2 ] ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath73 , controlling of switch between two different output lines .",
    "such hamiltonians describe a controlled scalar excitation , but for transfer of a qubit state it is enough to double number of lattices .    in general , we can consider such a kind of models as a tensor product of three hilbert spaces @xmath74 , _ viz _ , transmitted state , program and distributed target respectively .",
    "it is also can be considered as an extension of a control system to @xmath75 , when only subsystem @xmath1 may affect on transfer by @xmath2 .",
    "most methods discussed here may be used almost without change both for lattices and spin chains , because for the state transfer via spin chains with @xmath23 nodes nowadays @xcite often is used only @xmath23-dimensional subspace of whole @xmath76-dimensional hilbert space and a lattice with @xmath23 nodes may be used instead .    for a spin chain",
    "a simple relation with a lattice model exists only for spin - half particles and so , using one lattice with an internal space @xmath77 for the control and the transferred state , we lose the analogy with spin chains .",
    "it is possible to realize the control with some quantum system attached to a single lattice or use multiple parallel lattices or spin chains @xcite .",

    "realistic models of quantum information devices appropriate for such purposes may be found in many papers , from earliest suggestions @xcite till more recent works @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized , that there is some difference between a model of a global control of such chains @xcite and the programmable dynamics discussed in the present paper .",
    "it is usual distinction between general and programmable quantum networks @xcite , between the external control and the transfer driven by an internal state encoding a program of motion .",
    "a coined quantum walk on a circle @xcite may be considered _ formally _ as a special example of conditional quantum dynamics @xmath78 eq .",
    "( [ qubot ] ) with a control register , altered on each step by the hadamard transform @xmath79 ( or symmetric analogue @xmath80 @xcite ) with @xmath81 steps of evolution described by the operator @xmath82 .",
    "the theory of coined quantum walk has interesting outcome to analysis of the programmable quantum networks , because produces a wide set of examples with feeding a control register by nonorthogonal states .",
    "it was mentioned , that for usual theory of ( non - stochastic ) programmable quantum networks @xcite different states of a program should be orthogonal to ensure eq .",
    "( [ prog ] ) and prevent entanglement between the program and a data eq .",
    "( [ cent ] ) .",
    "it is convenient also to compare the coined quantum walk with the _ programmable quantum processors _",
    "@xcite containing third system , `` a tape '' and a gate @xmath83 for altering of a state of a control register after each step of evolution .",
    "so , instead of one gate @xmath3 eq .  ( [ prog ] ) is used an analogue of classical processor timing @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "a similar design may be used for programmable implementation of a coined quantum walk controlled by altered coin(s ) .",
    "different models with set of ( random ) coins provide possibility of `` tuning '' from the quantum to classical - like behavior @xcite .",
    "the programmable implementation of such a model could be compared with the generation of ( pseudo)random numbers and the monte - carlo simulations by a classical computer .",

    "an application @xmath85 with coins like @xmath86 , @xmath87 $ ] provide a smooth transition between an uniform motion and behavior of quantum walk @xcite .",
    "it is possible to introduce a simplest controlled coined quantum walk with @xmath23 different coins @xmath88 and three quantum systems with a step composed from two operators : @xmath89 .",

    "( [ cond ] ) for first and second systems , @xmath91 is the operator @xmath78 eq .",
    "( [ qubot ] ) on second and third systems .",
    "if first system has a state @xmath14 during @xmath81 steps , @xmath92 is a `` qubot driven '' quantum walk on third system with a coin @xmath88 .",
    "a state of a coin may be entangled with a state of a lattice .",
    "in such a case the second and third systems may be considered as a joint target , controlled by a state of first system .",
    "generalization of @xmath15 eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) for continuous parameters may be produced by the simple change of the sum to an integral @xcite and let us use smooth tuning of coins like @xmath93 above .",
    "in this work was considered unified approach to different models of the programmable quantum state transfer . it was used some methods of construction of programmable quantum networks with a higher - dimensional target system adapted for specific properties of distributed dynamical models .",
    "it was shown , that a simple `` qubot '' model may be extended to a programmable system associated with a short - range hamiltonian , coinciding with @xmath68 operator for some fictitious particle with high spin and widely used nowadays in the theory of the perfect state transfer .    in the paper",
    "was considered only the _ coined _ quantum walk because of particular structure .",
    "formally , the coin space resembles a specific version of a control register and so a programmable model of such a system should use a `` cascade '' with two control registers for a single target system .",
    "it may be formally treated also using a joint system with a coin and a lattice as a new target for control .",
