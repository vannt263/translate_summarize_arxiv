    "an electrorheological ( er ) fluid is a material whose viscosity changes substantially with the application of an electric field@xcite .",
    "generally , such fluids are suspensions of spherical inclusions of dielectric constant @xmath0 in a host fluid of a different dielectric constant @xmath1 .",
    "the viscosity is believed to change because the spheres acquire electric moments ( dipole and higher ) when an electric field is applied , then move under the influence of the electrical forces between these induced moments .",
    "these forces typically cause the spheres to line up in long chains parallel to the applied field , thereby increasing the viscosity of the suspension .",
    "the viscosity relaxes to its usual value when the field is turned off , and the chain - like structure disappears .",
    "er fluids have potential applications as variable viscosity fluids in automobile devices@xcite , vibration control@xcite , and elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , their operating principle is also relevant to other materials , such as magnetorheological ( mr ) fluids@xcite .",
    "these are suspensions of magnetically permeable spheres in a fluid of different permeability , whose viscosity can be controlled by an applied magnetic field .    to obtain a quantitative theory of er ( and mr ) fluids , one needs to understand the electric - field - induced force among the spheres . at low sphere concentrations and large inter - sphere separations ,",
    "this force is just that between two interacting electric dipoles whose magnitude is that of a single sphere in an external electric field .",
    "but at smaller separations , the force deviates from the dipole - dipole form . besides this electrostatic interaction between the spheres , there are other forces acting on the spheres , including a viscous frictional force from the host fluid , and a hard - sphere force when the two dielectric spheres come in contact . in the present paper , we will be concerned only with the electrostatic force .",
    "a number of existing theories go beyond the dipole - dipole approximation in calculating electrostatic forces in er fluids@xcite , and several experiments have been carried out which are relevant to forces in the non - dipole regime ( see , e.  g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "et al._@xcite have incorporated both multipole and multi - body effects into the sphere - sphere interactions , using a perturbation analysis .",
    "et al._@xcite have described a multipole expansion for the forces acting on one sphere in a chain of spheres in a fluid of different dielectric constant , and find a strong departure from the dipolar limit when the particles are closer than about one diameter .",
    "davis@xcite has calculated the electrostatic forces between dielectric spheres in a host fluid directly , using a finite element approach to solve laplace s equation for a chain of particles in a host dielectric . in a more recent work@xcite",
    ", he has used an integral equation approach to calculate the interparticle forces in er fluids , including effects due to time - dependent application of an external field , and nonlinear fluid conductivity",
    ". a finite - element approach has also been used by tao _",
    "et al._@xcite to solve laplace s equation and obtain the electrostatic interactions between particles in a chain of dielectric spheres in a host fluid ; they found , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the dipole - dipole approximation is reasonably accurate for large separations or moderate dielectric mismatches , but fails in closely spaced particles and large mismatches .",
    "clercx and bossis@xcite have gone beyond the approximation of dipolar interactions to include multipolar and many - body interactions , expressed in terms of the induced multipole moments on each sphere ; they also obtain an expression for the forces in terms of these induced multipole moments .    as discussed further below ,",
    "the electrical force acting on a sphere in an electrorheological fluid is basically the gradient of the total electrostatic energy of that fluid with respect to the position of the sphere .",
    "this total electrostatic energy can , in turn , be expressed in terms of the effective dielectric tensor of the suspension , a quantity which has been studied since the time of maxwell .",
    "indeed , numerous authors have calculated this tensor in a wide variety of geometries , going well beyond the regime of purely dipolar interactions .",
    "for example , jeffrey@xcite has calculated the total energy of two spheres in a suspension as a function of their separation and the dielectric mismatch . from this total energy ,",
    "the force can be obtained numerically as the derivative of this energy with respect to separation .",
    "recently , the pairwise forces between spheres of different sizes have been calculated using the so - called dipole - induced - dipole approximation , and even approximately including the effects of other spheres@xcite . once again",
    ", the forces were obtained explicitly by numerically differentiating the total electrostatic energy with respect to particle coordinates .",
    "mcphedran and mckenzie@xcite , and suen _ et al._@xcite , and many others , have calculated the total energy of spheres arranged in a periodic structure . in principle , forces could also be extracted from this calculation by taking numerical derivatives , provided that the distortions of the structure leave it periodic .",
    "the energy of a non - periodic suspension of many spheres has been studied by grardy and ausloos@xcite and by fu _",
    "et al._@xcite , in both cases including large numbers of multipoles .",
    "once again , forces can be extracted , in principle , from these calculations by taking numerical derivatives of the computed total energies with respect to sphere coordinates .",
    "several authors have included the effects of finite conductivity on forces in electrorheological fluids , and have also considered how such forces depend on frequency .",
    "davis@xcite has analyzed polarization forces and related effects of conductivity in er fluids .",
    "et al._@xcite have calculated the attractive force between spherical dielectric particles in a conducting film .",
    "khusid and acrivos@xcite have considered electric - field - induced aggregation in er fluids , including interfacial polarization of the particles , the conductivities of both the particles and the host fluid , and dynamics arising from dielectric relaxation .",
    "claro and rojas@xcite have calculated the frequency - dependent interaction energy of polarizable particles in the presence of an applied laser field within the dipole approximation ; they considered primarily optical frequencies rather than the low frequencies more characteristic of er fluids .",
    "et al._@xcite have considered several frequency - dependent properties of er systems , starting from a well - known spectral representation@xcite for the dielectric function of a two - component composite medium .",
    "finally , huang@xcite has carried out a calculation of the force acting in electrorheological _ solids _ under the application of a non - uniform electric field , and considering both finite frequency and finite conductivity effects .",
    "a common feature of most of the above approaches is that they involve first calculating the _ total electrostatic energy _ of the suspensions , then obtaining the forces by numerically differentiating this energy with respect to a particle coordinate .",
    "this numerical differentiation is cumbersome and can be inaccurate .",
    "@xcite does give an expression for the force , but in terms of implicitly defined multipoles .",
    "in this paper , by contrast , we describe a method for calculating these forces _ explicitly _ , _ without numerical differentiation_. this approach is computationally much more accurate than numerically differentiating the energy . while our new method may appear to be merely a computational advance , its additional accuracy and flexibility should make it widely applicable .    specifically , our approach allows one to calculate the electric - field - induced force between two dielectric spheres in a host of a different dielectric constant , at any separation .",
    "it is applicable , in principle , to spheres of unequal sizes , to particles of shape other than spheres , to suspensions in which either the particle or the host or both have nonzero conductivities , and to systems whose constituents have frequency - dependent complex dielectric functions . it can also be used to calculate the electrostatic force on one particle which is part of a _ many - particle _ system , and thus is not limited to two - body interaction .",
    "it should thus be useful in quite general circumstances including , in particular , non - dilute suspensions .",
    "our approach starts , as do previous calculations , with a method for calculating the total electrostatic energy of a suspension of ( two or more ) spheres in a host material of different dielectric constant .",
    "we choose to express this total energy in terms of a certain pole spectrum arising from the quasistatic resonances of the multi - sphere system@xcite .",
    "this representation has previously been used to calculate the frequency - dependent shear modulus , static yield stress , and structures of certain er systems@xcite .",
    "the force on a given sphere in a multi - sphere system involves a gradient of this energy with respect to the position of that sphere .",
    "but rather than evaluating this derivative numerically , as in previous work@xcite , we express this derivative in closed analytical form in terms of the pole spectrum and certain matrix elements involving the resonances .",
    "this expression is readily evaluated simply by diagonalizing a certain matrix , all of whose components are readily computed .",
    "our approach has formal similarities to the well - known hellmann - feynman expression for forces in quantum - mechanical systems@xcite . in the quantum - mechanical case ,",
    "the force is expressed as the negative gradient of system energy with respect to an ionic position .",
    "this energy is the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the ground state . according to the hellmann - feynman theorem",
    ", the gradient operator can be moved inside the matrix element , thereby eliminating the need to take numerical derivatives .",
    "the hellmann - feynman force expression is the basis for many highly successful molecular dynamics studies in quantum systems ( see , e.  g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present classical case ,",
    "the total energy can also be expressed as a certain matrix element of an operator , and thus , just as in the quantum problem , the force is the gradient of that expectation value . in this paper",
    ", we shall show that , again as in the quantum case , the gradient operator can be moved to within the matrix element , and the need to take a numerical derivative is eliminated .",
    "this simplification allows , in principle , the calculation of forces in very complicated geometries , even though , in the present paper we shall give only relatively simple numerical illustrations involving forces between two spherical particles .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : level2 ] , we present the formalism necessary to calculate the forces in a system of two or more dielectric spheres in a host medium , without taking a numerical derivative . in section [ sec : level3 ] , we give several numerical examples of these forces , at both zero and finite frequencies , for a two - sphere system .",
    "section [ sec : level4 ] presents a concluding discussion and suggestions for future work .",
    "let us assume that we have a composite consisting of spherical inclusions of isotropic dielectric constant @xmath0 in a host of isotropic dielectric constant @xmath1 , both of which may be complex and frequency - dependent .",
    "we will assume that a spatially uniform electric field @xmath2 $ ] is applied in an arbitrary direction ( we take @xmath3 real ) .",
    "we also assume that the system is in the  quasistatic regime .  in this regime , the product @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wave vector and @xmath6 is a characteristic length scale describing the spatial variation of @xmath7 . under these conditions , the local electric field @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the electrostatic potential .",
    "finally , we assume that the @xmath10 spherical inclusion is centered at @xmath11 , and has radius @xmath12 .",
    "the approach which we use automatically includes all local field effects .",
    "since our force expressions differ slightly at zero and finite frequencies , we will first present the formalism at @xmath13 , and then generalize the results to finite @xmath14 .",
    "* a. zero frequency *    if the position of the spheres is fixed , the total electrostatic energy may be written in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the system volume , @xmath17 is a component of the macroscopic effective dielectric tensor , and @xmath18 is a component of the applied electric field .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) is , in fact , a possible definition of @xmath19@xcite . to produce this applied field ,",
    "we require that @xmath20 at the boundary @xmath21 of the system , which is assumed to be a closed surface enclosing @xmath16 .",
    "in writing eq.([eq : w ] ) , we allow for the possibility that the spheres in the composite are arranged in such a way that the composite is anisotropic even though its components are not . for an _ isotropic _ composite ,",
    "@xmath22 may be written in terms of a certain pole spectrum of the composite as@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 is a pole , and @xmath26 is the corresponding residue .",
    "the poles @xmath25 are confined to the interval @xmath27 . for an _ anisotropic _ composite",
    ", this form may be generalized to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a kronecker delta function and @xmath30 is a matrix of residues .",
    "this form is general , applicable to any two - component composite material which is made up of isotropic constituents , but is not necessarily isotropic macroscopically . as in the isotropic case ,",
    "the poles are confined to the interval @xmath31 .",
    "the poles @xmath25 are the eigenvalues of a certain hermitian operator @xmath32 , and the residues @xmath26 are determined by the eigenvectors of that operator .",
    "@xmath32 is defined in terms of its operation on an arbitrary function @xmath33 by the relation @xmath34 where the integration runs over the total volume @xmath35 of all the inclusions of @xmath0 . as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we introduce a `` bra - ket '' notation for two potential functions to denote their inner product , @xmath36 physically , the eigenvalues correspond to the frequencies of the natural electrostatic modes of the composites , at which charge can oscillate without any applied field , and the corresponding eigenvectors describe the electric fields of those modes .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath32 in terms of its matrix elements between the normalized eigenstates of isolated spheres . in this basis , and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : integro ] ) and ( [ eq : inner ] ) , it is found that @xmath32 has the following matrix elements : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 will be given further below . inside the sphere centered at * r * , @xmath40 is equal to an eigenfunction or resonance state of that isolated sphere , while outside that sphere @xmath41 .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath40 is given by the spherical harmonic @xmath42 , which has an order @xmath43 multipole moment of electric polarization .",
    "however , the eigenvalue of this state depends only on @xmath44 : @xmath45    the quantity @xmath46 represents the matrix element of @xmath32 between two states of two different , non - overlapping spheres ( i.  e. , @xmath47 ) and is given by @xmath48^{1/2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\ , e^{i\\,\\phi_{{\\bf r}^\\prime-{\\bf r}}(m^\\prime - m ) } p_{\\ell^\\prime + \\ell}^{\\,m^\\prime - m } ( \\cos\\theta_{{\\bf r}^\\prime-{\\bf r } } ) , \\label{eq : q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are polar and azimuthal angles of the vector @xmath51 , and the functions @xmath52 are the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "if we denote the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 by @xmath53 , then @xmath25 and @xmath54 satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath55 since @xmath32 is a hermitian operator , the eigenvalues @xmath25 are real , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are orthogonal and can be chosen to be orthonormal .",

    "it is convenient to expand both the eigenfunctions @xmath56 and the states @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , in terms of the single - sphere eigenfunctions @xmath66 mentioned above . in bra - ket notation ,",

    "combining these results , we can re - express the matrix elements ( [ eq : epseij ] ) of the dielectric tensor in bra - ket notation first as @xmath78 where the explicit forms of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : malphi ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : dwdrk ] ) bears a resemblance to the hellmann - feynman theorem in quantum mechanics@xcite : in both cases , the derivative of an operator with respect to a parameter appears inside a matrix element .",
    "but there is a significant difference between the two . in the hellmann - feynman case ,",
    "the ket which plays the role of @xmath62 is an eigenstate of an operator , which is the actual hamiltonian of the system .",

    "this simplification allows forces to be computed without carrying out numerical derivatives .",
    "( [ eq : force2 ] ) may appear to be rather difficult to apply in practice .",
    "but in fact it is computationally quite tractable",

    "likewise , the matrix elements of @xmath103 can be obtained from @xmath32 purely by elementary calculus .",
    "thus , in order to compute the force component @xmath104 , one first finds the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath32 ( and hence of @xmath100 ) , then computes the matrix @xmath105 in the basis in which @xmath32 is diagonal , and finally the matrix elements @xmath106 , from which the force can be computed for any direction of the applied field @xmath3 . since the diagonalization can be done with standard computer packages , the whole procedure is well defined and straightforward .",
    "furthermore , once @xmath32 has been diagonalized , the same basis can be used to compute the forces for any value of the variable @xmath107 .    to illustrate how this formalism can actually be used to compute the force explicitly",

    "the forces exhibit a large departure from the predictions of the dipole - dipole interaction , and this departure becomes greater as @xmath0 deviates more and more from unity .",
    "next , we consider an example in which the dielectric functions of both the inclusion and the host depend on frequency .",
    "specifically , we choose @xmath174 and @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the imaginary unit , @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the dielectric constants of the inclusion and the host , and @xmath179 and @xmath180 are their conductivities , assumed frequency - independent .",
    "the _ time - averaged _ forces are now calculated from the generalization of eq .",

    "( [ eq : fcomplex ] ) .",
    "we have chosen to use parameters given by ref .",
    "@xcite , in a recent experimental study .",
    "these are listed in table ii .",
    "however , as discussed further below , it is possible that the experimentally measured forces include effects beyond the purely electrostatic interactions included in our model ( such as spatially dependent conductivities of the host fluid ) .",
    "therefore , our numerical results should again be considered as model calculations , not necessarily applicable to the specific experiments of ref .  @xcite . in all cases , we assume that the two spherical inclusions are identical , with a dielectric constant and conductivity characteristic of @xmath181 . for the host fluid , we have considered the various materials used in the measurements of ref .",
    "( in practice , the nonzero conductivity of srtio@xmath182 has negligible effect on force ; we have checked this by recalculating the forces with the conductivity set equal to zero , and obtained the same results . ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the radial component of the calculated time - averaged force on a sphere of @xmath181 at @xmath183 in the parallel and perpendicular geometries , for the host materials of silicone oil and castor oil . in both cases ,",
    "we assume spheres of radius @xmath184 , intersphere spacing @xmath185 and applied electric field @xmath186 , as in ref .",
    "the magnitude of force decreases with increasing frequency , but rapidly converges to a constant value in both cases .",
    "the sign of the force is negative in ( a ) , corresponding to an attractive force , and positive ( repulsive ) in ( b ) .",
    "if these were strictly dipole - dipole forces , the time - averaged force on the sphere at @xmath11 would be given by the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdipole ] ) to complex dielectric functions and @xmath187 , namely @xmath188 .",
    "\\label{eq : force1a}\\ ] ] thus , in particular , the magnitude of the force in the parallel case would be twice as large as that in the perpendicular case , as in our previous examples .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] , this force ratio is about @xmath168 .",
    "this difference occurs , as in fig.[fig : eqsize ] , because of the very small separation ( @xmath185 ) , which corresponds to a very short - ranged interaction . in the long range limit ( @xmath166 )",
    ", our calculated magnitude ratio agrees well with the dipole - dipole prediction , as discussed further below .",
    "this short - distance deviation from dipole - dipole forces is similar to that seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : eqsize][fig : leich ] .",
    "[ fig : sc ] also shows that there is a substantial difference between the forces for silicone oil and castor oil hosts .",
    "this difference is due almost entirely to the difference in the static dielectric constants of these two hosts : the effect of the finite conductivity disappears by about @xmath189 in both cases , whereas the difference between the forces persists to much higher frequencies .",
    "the calculated time - averaged force between spheres of srtio@xmath182 in a silicone oil host is plotted versus separation in fig.[fig : distance ] at a frequency of @xmath190 . in order to see the effects of a finite host conductivity",
    ", we include this conductivity in figs .",
    "[ fig : distance ] ( a ) and [ fig : distance ] ( b ) but not in [ fig : distance ] ( c ) or [ fig : distance ] ( d ) .",
    "we also set the conductivity of the sphere equal to zero in ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "clearly , the host conductivity has very little influence on the forces at this frequency . for comparison",
    ", we also show the forces as calculated in the dipole - dipole approximation . as can be seen , there is very little difference between the two except for @xmath191 .",
    "even at such small spacings , the deviation from the dipole - dipole force is much larger for the parallel than the perpendicular configuration . at a spacing of @xmath192 , the calculated ratio of force magnitudes in the parallel and perpendicular configurations exceeds a factor of @xmath193 . at sufficiently high host conductivity",
    ", our model predicts that the force between spheres changes sign as a function of frequency .",
    "this trend is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebesms ] for a separation of @xmath185 between spheres .",
    "the host materials used here are ethyl benzoate , ethyl salicylate , and methyl salicylate , all of which have much greater conductivities than silicone oil .",
    "the sign change is due mainly to the greater conductivities , not the differences in static dielectric constants . to check this point",
    ", we recalculated the points of fig .",
    "[ fig : ebesms ] assuming the same value of the real part of the dielectric constant for all three host materials ; we found that the time - averaged forces changed sign at the same frequencies as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebesms ] .",
    "mathematically , the origin of the sign change is , of course , the dependence of the variable @xmath194 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) and ( [ eq : fcomplex ] ) on the host conductivity .    the time - averaged force for this separation ranges from about @xmath195 to @xmath196 for the parallel case , depending on the frequency , and from about @xmath197 to @xmath198 for the perpendicular case .",
    "at high frequencies , the force approaches @xmath199 for the parallel case , whatever the host fluid is , and approaches a much smaller magnitude in the perpendicular case .",
    "the ratio of these forces differs greatly from the predictions of the dipole - dipole interaction , as expected for such a small separation .",
    "at very low frequencies , however , the force ratio appears to approach the dipole - dipole prediction .",
    "[ fig : sn2 ] shows the frequency dependence of the time - averaged force between two spheres of srtio@xmath182 for silicone oil and @xmath200 hosts .",
    "both the spacings @xmath201 between the two spheres and the electric field @xmath202 are larger than those for fig.[fig : sc ] ; they are given in the legends of each figure .",
    "we chose these values for the parameters because they are used in the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite . evidently , the force between the two spheres is stronger when the two spheres are immersed in a liquid host than in a gas , all the other parameters of the forces being held constant .",
    "this behavior can be understood even in the dipole - dipole limit : it is due to the dependence of the force on @xmath1 as in eq.([eq : force1a ] ) . also , the low - frequency forces in fig.[fig : sn2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) and especially ( c ) and ( d ) depend more weakly on frequency than those in fig .  [",
    "fig : sc ] .",
    "another point is that , even though the intersphere spacing @xmath201 has been increased to @xmath203 and @xmath204 in these calculations , the calculated forces are still far from the dipole - dipole limit . specifically , the ratio of the force magnitudes in the parallel and perpendicular geometries greatly exceeds the factor of two expected in the dipole - dipole limit . however , this ratio is smaller than that of fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] , presumably because the intersphere separations are larger than in that figure .",
    "the present work permits calculation of electrical forces in er fluids in a concise closed form , which permits inclusion of all multipoles and all many - body forces in a simple way . in our approach",
    ", the forces do not need to be calculated as numerical derivatives ; instead , we give explicit analytical expressions for these derivatives , in terms of a pole spectrum which characterizes the microgeometry of the material .",
    "the explicit form for the derivatives is somewhat reminiscent of the hellmann - feynman description of quantum - mechanical forces in electronic structure theory , but differs from it in the important respects .",
    "one striking feature of the present formalism is that it allows for the calculation of frequency - dependent forces in a simple closed form .",
    "although such forces have been discussed in previous work@xcite , the present approach is relatively simple and more general , and places both zero and finite frequency forces within the same formalism . in our numerical work , we find that these forces can even change sign as a function of frequency .",
    "such frequency - dependence is , of course , also present in the long - range ( dipole - dipole ) limit treated by others in the previous work , but it is even more apparent in the present study .",
    "although in the present work calculations have been carried out explicitly for two - body interaction , they can readily be extended to three - body ( or multi - body ) forces .",
    "the general equation ( [ eq : force2 ] ) or ( [ eq : fcomplex ] ) can be used to find the force on a sphere , no matter how many particles are contained in the suspension . indeed , such multi - body forces are very likely to play important roles in dense suspensions , where they could possibly lead to  bond - angle - dependent  forces analogous to angle dependent interatomic elastic forces in liquid and solid semiconductors .",
    "likewise , the calculations could be readily extended to more complex particles ( e.  g. , hollow spherical shells ) , and to non - spherical particles , provided that the requisite pole spectra and matrix elements can be calculated . also ,",
    "although we have restricted our calculations in this paper to the radial component of the interparticle forces , other components can be straightforwardly computed .",
    "finally , the present formalism can be immediately extended to the important case of magnetorheological fluids . for such fluids , eq.([eq : force2 ] ) or ( [ eq : fcomplex ] ) for the force would continue to be valid , provided that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are replaced by @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "our calculated frequency - dependent forces , obtained using parameters quoted for srtio@xmath182 spheres in a conducting host , may appear to disagree with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite at close spacing .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the host fluid does not exhibit its usual bulk conductivity when two highly polarizable spheres are placed in it in close proximity . instead",
    ", there could well be non - linear screening effects of the debye - hckel type@xcite , which would mean that the picture of a two - component composite is simply not appropriate in this regime . in support of this hypothesis",
    ", we note that the reported experimental forces are still frequency - dependent at high frequencies , while the complex dielectric functions of both host and sphere should be nearly frequency - independent in this regime , leading to a frequency - independent force in this range .",
    "the present method could readily be combined with standard molecular dynamics approaches to compute _ dynamical _ properties of electrorheological ( or magnetorheological ) fluids .",
    "specifically , one could carry out molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations , following the approach of several authors@xcite .",
    "in such approaches , the force on a given sphere is typically expressed as the sum of a hard - sphere repulsion , a viscous force , and an electrostatic force .",
    "the first two of these forces would be the same as in the previous md studies , but the third would be calculated using the present method , rather than the dipole - dipole force generally used in most other md studies .",
    "it would be of great interest to see how such quantities as viscous relaxation time would be affected by using our forces in these calculations .",
    "in addition to such calculations , one could study minimum - energy configurations of dielectric suspensions in an applied electric field , based on the forces calculated using the methods outlined here .",
    "many such studies can already be found in the literature ( see , e.  g. , ref .  @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "it would be of interest to extend the present approach to calculating minimum - energy configurations including non - dipolar forces , as outlined in the present work .",
