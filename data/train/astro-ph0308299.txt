    "radio pulsars are categorized as either `` normal '' or `` recycled '' objects .",
    "normal pulsars are observationally more numerous and are predominantly young isolated objects with spin periods in the range 30 ms @xmath3 s , strong inferred surface dipole magnetic field strengths ( @xmath4 g ) and characteristic ages in the range @xmath5 yr .",
    "recycled pulsars have shorter spin periods ( 1.5 ms @xmath6 ms ) , weaker magnetic fields ( @xmath7 g ) , larger ages ( @xmath8 yr ) and are usually members of binary systems with either white dwarf or neutron star companions .    the normal pulsars are thought to be born in supernovae and spin down due to magnetic dipole braking ( see e.g.  gunn & ostriker 1970 ) . the favoured theory for the origin of recycled pulsars",
    "involves an old neutron star that is spun up ( recycled ) through the accretion of matter from a binary companion which overflows its roche lobe ( bisnovatyi - kogan & komberg 1974 ) . during the spin - up phase",
    ", the system is expected to be visible as an x - ray binary .",
    "the duration of the x - ray phase and amount of spin up depends upon the mass of the companion star . for those companions massive enough to explode as a supernova , the x - ray lifetime is relatively short ( @xmath9 yr ) and the most likely outcome is the disruption of the binary .",
    "those systems fortunate enough to survive the explosion are the double neutron star ( hereafter dns ) binaries ( e.g. , the original binary pulsar b1913 + 16 ) . for less massive companions , where the period of spin up is longer ( @xmath10 yr )",
    ", the subsequent collapse leaves a white dwarf star in orbit around a rapidly spinning millisecond pulsar . for a detailed review of these evolutionary scenarios , see bhattacharya & van den heuvel ( 1991 ) and references therein .    in order to understand the population of recycled pulsars in detail ,",
    "a statistically significant sample is required .",
    "because of their short spin periods and , often , binary orbits , detecting these elusive objects is a computationally intensive process requiring state - of - the - art data acquisition systems , significant data storage and computational power for post processing . in 1994",
    "the penn state pulsar machine ( pspm ) , a new analogue filterbank spectrometer ( cadwell 1997 ) , was installed at the 305-m arecibo telescope and has been in regular use as a pulsar search and timing instrument ever since . in march 2002 , we began using part of a high - speed computer cluster to process various sets of pspm data taken during the latter stages of the arecibo upgrade ( 19968 ) .",
    "to date , we have discovered a dozen new pulsars and re - detected over 40 previously known ones .",
    "preliminary details of the search were given by mclaughlin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    here",
    "we report on an isolated 55.7-ms pulsar j0609 + 2130 , one of the first new discoveries from our searches .",
    "while the spin parameters of the new pulsar are similar to other recycled pulsars , the lack of a binary companion poses interesting questions as to its origin .",
    "the layout of the rest of this paper is as follows : in  [ sec : obs ] we briefly describe the survey observations , data acquisition system and analysis pipelines .",
    "the results of the analysis and subsequent timing observations of j0609 + 2130 are given in ",
    "[ sec : res ] .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : disc ] , we discuss the new pulsar s properties in the context of its likely origin and evolution .",
    "the data presented here were taken with the arecibo radio telescope during a 9.5-hr maintenance period in october 1998 when upgrade operations required that the telescope was parked at @xmath11 azimuth .",
    "the 430-mhz line - feed system , traditionally used for pulsar observations , was not available for use on this occasion .",
    "we therefore took advantage of the newly commissioned 430-mhz receiver in the gregorian dome which was in a fixed position at @xmath12 from the zenith .",
    "although the 430-mhz gregorian receiver illuminates less of the dish than the line - feed so that the forward gain is lower ( 11 k / jy cf .  18 k / jy for the line feed ) ,",
    "the lower system temperature ( 45 k cf .  120 k ) and reduced levels of interference make it a very attractive receiver for pulsar searching . in this setup ,",
    "sources at declination @xmath13 drift through the 11-arcmin primary beam in @xmath14 s. the total area covered was @xmath15 deg@xmath16 along an 11-arcmin slice through the galactic anti - centre in the right ascension range @xmath17 centred at @xmath18 .",
    "the incoming signals from the telescope were passed to the pspm which summed the two independent polarizations before 4-bit sampling the band into @xmath19-khz channels every 80 @xmath20s . for this choice of sampling interval ,",
    "a @xmath21-pt fourier transform is well matched to the 44-s transit time of sources through the 430-mhz beam .",
    "the resulting data were then written directly to magnetic tape for offline analysis .    searches for periodic and transient radio signals in the data were carried out using cobra , a 180-processor beowulf cluster at jodrell bank observatory . deferring a more complete discussion for a future paper , we now briefly outline the main procedures . to correct for the dispersive effects of the interstellar medium",
    ", the raw pspm data were dedispersed at 392 different trial dispersion measures ( dms ) in the range @xmath22 dm @xmath23 @xmath24 pc using freely available analysis tools ( lorimer 2001 ) .",
    "the resulting dedispersed time series were then passed to two different analysis pipelines . in the first ,",
    "the data were fourier transformed and the resulting amplitude spectra were searched for significant features indicating the presence of a periodic signal . to increase the sensitivity to narrow duty cycle pulses , spectra summing 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 harmonics were also searched .",
    "candidates with signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios above 8 were then analysed in the time and radio frequency domain to produce diagnostic plots which were saved for later visual inspection .",
    "further details can be found in lorimer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    in the second analysis pipeline ,",
    "the dedispersed data were searched in the time domain for pulses with s / n @xmath25 using software developed by cordes & mclaughlin ( 2003 ) .",
    "this search was aimed at finding individual and giant pulses from some pulsars where the periodic signal may be below the threshold of the fourier analysis ( see e.g.  nice 1999 ) . to maximize sensitivity over a variety of pulse widths ,",
    "each time series was smoothed by up to 64 adjacent samples .",
    "given the measured system equivalent flux density of the 430-mhz gregorian receiver ( 3.3 jy ) , we estimate the sensitivity of the fourier analysis to be @xmath26 mjy to long - period pulsars observed away from the galactic plane . for millisecond pulsars , with typical periods of 5 ms and pulse duty cycles of order 60%",
    ", we estimate the sensitivity to be closer to 3 mjy .",
    "the detection threshold of the single - pulse search is about 0.5 jy to the narrowest pulses .",
    "full details of the search sensitivity will be presented elsewhere .",
    "two pulsar - like signals were detected in the periodicity search .",
    "one of these was the 33-ms crab pulsar , b0531 + 21 ( also seen in the single - pulse analysis ) detected in several adjacent beams with s / n @xmath27 .",
    "the remaining candidate , a 55.7-ms signal with dm @xmath28 and s / n @xmath29 , was re - observed and confirmed as the new pulsar j0609 + 2130 in april 2002 . only one other previously known pulsar , b0525 + 21 , lies within the region covered by this search .",
    "this was not detected in either the periodicity or the single - pulse search .",
    "a closer scrutiny of the raw search data revealed no detectable signal . since the data were not obviously affected by radio - frequency interference ,",
    "two possible effects are responsible for the non - detection : either ( a ) since this pulsar is known to null for approximately 25% of the time ( biggs 1990 ) it is quite likely that the survey observations caught this pulsar in a null state ; or ( b ) the pulsar s flux density was significantly reduced by diffractive interstellar scintillation . given the normally high mean flux density of this pulsar ( 57 mjy at 408 mhz ; lorimer et al .",
    "1995 ) , nulling seems the most likely explanation for the non - detection .    to determine the detailed spin and astrometric parameters of j0609 + 2130 ,",
    "we have been carrying out regular 430-mhz timing observations since june 2002 .",
    "these observations use the pspm in timing mode , where the incoming signals are folded modulo the period predicted from an ephemeris initially derived from the confirmation observation . in timing mode , folded 1024-bin pulse profiles for each of the 128 frequency channels of the pspm are written to disk every 180 s. we initially collected at least three of these 180-s observations per epoch in order to enable high - precision estimates of the pulse period . the timing analysis proceeded by forming the dedispersed profile across the band of the pspm for each 180-s observation and estimating the pulse phase by cross correlating each profile with a high s / n template using procedures identical to those described in detail by lorimer , camilo & xilouris ( 2002 ) .",

    "although our observations at other frequencies are not yet numerous enough to characterize the radio spectrum of j0609 + 2130 with any certainty , our preliminary flux estimate of 2 mjy at 327-mhz implies that it is a steep - spectrum source that is most readily detectable in low - frequency surveys .",
    "our timing measurements of psr  j0609 + 2130 reveal a period derivative @xmath46 .",

    "we expect pulsars like them to be quite common in the galaxy . indeed , kalogera & lorimer ( 2000 ) estimated the galactic population of pulsars like j2235 + 1506 to be @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the fraction of @xmath53 sr covered by the radio beam . for a beaming fraction of 30%",
    "( i.e.  @xmath54 ) the galactic population of these objects is likely to be of order 15,000 .    what is the origin of weakly magnetized isolated pulsars like j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 ?",
    "one possibility is that they are simply part of the same population as the normal pulsars .",
    "to investigate this idea quantitatively , we can take the best - fitting initial magnetic field distribution in a recent population study of isolated pulsars by arzoumanian , chernoff & cordes ( 2002 ) . for their distribution ,",
    "only about one in the expected galactic population of @xmath38 neutron stars is born with @xmath55 g , clearly inconsistent with the population estimates made above . unless there is a weak - field component to the neutron star magnetic field distribution that has been overlooked by population studies so far , a more efficient means of forming these weakly - magnetized neutron stars is required .",
    "a pulsar born with a stronger magnetic field could , in principle , evolve to resemble psr  j0609 + 2130 through long - term decay of the magnetic field . while the existence of field decay for the pulsar population at large remains controversial ( see e.g.  bhattacharya et al .",
    "1992 ) , available evidence suggests that , for objects comparable in age and magnetic - field strength to j0609 + 2130 , any decay must act on extremely long timescales .",
    "where such pulsars are found in binary systems , studies of their white - dwarf companions provide an independent age estimate through cooling models , affirming the long - lived nature of the pulsars and constraining the existence of field decay ( kulkarni 1986 ) .",
    "of course , j0609 + 2130 is an isolated pulsar , but it seems unlikely that non - binarity would somehow encourage rapid field decay .",
    "camilo , nice & taylor ( 1993 ) suggested that j2235 + 1506 might be the remains of a high - mass binary system that disrupted at the time of the second supernova explosion . in this scenario , psrs j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 are the first - born neutron stars in their respective binaries and initially spin down as regular neutron stars . during roche - lobe overflow from the subsequently evolved secondary star ,",
    "mass accretion reduces the magnetic field ( see e.g.  romani 1990 ) , and also spins up the neutron star in the process .",
    "if the secondary is sufficiently massive to undergo a supernova explosion , the most likely outcome is disruption of the binary , releasing a newly - born neutron star and a recycled pulsar .",
    "those binary systems more likely to survive this explosion as dns binaries are the tightly - bound systems with short orbital periods .",
    "the wider binaries , which are much less likely to survive the explosion , release recycled pulsars with spin properties akin to j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 into the galactic field .",
    "we hereafter refer to these as `` disrupted recycled pulsars '' ( drps ) .    using this evolutionary scenario for drps as a working hypothesis ,",
    "we now return to the @xmath50 diagram in fig .  [ fig : bp ] to investigate the post - accretion spin periods of drps after the accretion phase . in their analysis of dns binaries , arzoumanian , cordes & wasserman ( 1999 ; hereafter acw )",
    "discuss two equilibrium spin period relations for the spin - up of a neutron star in a binary system .",
    "the first of these is the familiar limit for spherical accretion of matter in which the limiting spin period is set by the corresponding keplerian orbital period at the so - called alfvn radius ( see e.g.  ghosh & lamb 1992 ) . on the @xmath50 plane",
    ", this translates to a relationship of the form @xmath56 .",
    "the constant of proportionality in this expression depends on a number of factors such as the mass accretion rate , the radius and moment of inertia of the neutron star and the opacity of the accreting material .",
    "the uncertainties in these parameters result in a family of @xmath56 curves .",
    "two such curves , assuming accretion at the eddington rate and at one - fifth of this value , are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : bp ] using the relationship quoted by acw . for any pulsar , in the absence of magnetic field decay , we can estimate the spin period at the end of the accretion phase by tracing a horizontal line from the current position on fig .",
    "[ fig : bp ] to the spin - up line . under these assumptions",
    ", we infer that the intial spin period of j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 would have been in the range 1020 ms .",
    "acw pointed out that , for high - mass binary systems , the above picture is oversimplified since the lifetime of the donor star will be much less than the accretion time scale at which the alfvn limit is reached .",
    "they show that this condition produces a second family of limiting period curves which , on the @xmath50 plane , take the form @xmath57 . as noted by acw ,",
    "these curves are much more sensitive to uncertainties in the accretion parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bp ] we plot two such spin - up lines , again assuming accretion at the eddington rate and one - fifth of this limit .",
    "it is clear that , for sub - eddington accretion , the initial spin period of these drps would be much longer , perhaps very similar to their currently observed spin periods .    as noted by acw , since pulsar characteristic ages @xmath58 assume a negligible post - accretion spin period",
    ", one consequence of these accretion scenarios is that dns binaries are younger objects than their characteristic ages suggest .",
    "if drps are formed by a similar process , the same applies to them .",
    "for example , a more likely `` post - spinup '' age for j0609 + 2130 based on a limiting spin period of 40 ms would be about half its characteristic age ( i.e.  about 1.5 gyr ) .      is the drp hypothesis consistent with the observations ?",
    "one parameter that can be confronted by both theory and observation is the `` survival probability '' of the binary system , hereafter @xmath59 , defined as the fraction of binary systems that remain bound after the second supernova explosion .",
    "numerous authors have followed the orbital evolution of a wide variety of binary systems containing neutron stars using detailed monte carlo simulations ( see e.g.  lipunov & prokhorov 1984 ; dewey & cordes 1987 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ) .",
    "we use the relatively up - to - date simulations of portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) who include a maxwellian kick velocity distribution with a mean of 415 km s@xmath1 in their simulations . from the results presented in table 1 of their paper , for this model",
    ", we infer @xmath60 .",
    "based upon this low survival probability , we therefore expect drps to be much more common in the galaxy than the dns binaries .",
    "to estimate @xmath59 from an observational perspective , we note that the expected spin parameters of the recycled pulsar we observe in a dns binary are the same as those of the putative drps .",
    "we can therefore reasonably expect the pulsars in dns binaries to have the same radio lifetimes as the drps .",
    "hence , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the total numbers of dns binaries and drps in the galaxy , it follows that @xmath63 using the results of a recent population study of dns binaries by kim , kalogera & lorimer ( 2003 ) , we take @xmath64 population to be @xmath65 ( a factor of 2 higher than quoted by kim , kalogera & lorimer 2003 , to crudely account for the population of dns binaries that do not coalesce in a hubble time ) . using the above estimate of @xmath66",
    ", we find @xmath67 .",
    "one outstanding issue is the observed numbers of drps . given the above estimate for @xmath59 , we would expect to see roughly 10 drps for each dns binary .",
    "so far , however , we have identified only two drps : j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 , compared to four dns binaries in fig .",
    "[ fig : bp ] .",
    "three main possibilities which might explain this apparently significant deficit of drps are : ( a ) drps are present in the observed sample , but are hard to identify since they have no binary companion .",
    "although there are perhaps a further four drp - like pulsars known ( see table 1 of kalogera & lorimer 2000 ) , a more thorough analysis of the sample would be worthwhile .",
    "( b ) the neutron star kick velocity distribution could be lower than assumed in the population synthesis .",
    "this would lead to an increase in @xmath59 and reduce the discrepancy .",
    "a population synthesis dedicated to this question would certainly be useful .",
    "( c ) the above drp population estimates are somewhat crude and are based currently on j2235 + 1506 which is a nearby , low - luminosity object .",
    "a revision of these estimates to better account for small - number statistics is strongly recommended .    in summary ,",
    "while it seems currently plausible that j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 are examples of disrupted x - ray binary systems , there are a number of open issues linking the two populations .",
    "careful population studies to properly identify and estimate the drp population and binary population syntheses to predict the survival rate are both strongly recommended .",
    "further observational input should come both in the substantial numbers of pulsars now being found in the parkes multibeam survey ( manchester et al .",
    "2001 ) , and also proper motion measurements . for j2235 + 1506 ,",
    "the implied transverse speed is @xmath68 km s@xmath1 ( camilo , nice & taylor 1996 ) .",
    "if j0609 + 2130 has a similar proper motion , it should be detectable in our on - going arecibo timing observations by early 2005 .",
