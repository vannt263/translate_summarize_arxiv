    "the diffuse background from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) is an important tracer of the interstellar dust and most of our knowledge of the large scale distribution of the dust has come from missions such as _ iras _  and _ cobe _ ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "scattering in the uv is complementary to the ir emission and the combination of the two can lead to a unique determination of the interstellar dust parameters .",
    "unfortunately , there have been few observations of the diffuse uv radiation field and those have been , to a large degree , controversial as indicated by the conflicting reviews by @xcite and @xcite . in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv - below 1200",
    " ) band , which we address in this paper , the only significant body of observations comes from @xcite .",
    "they used the ultraviolet spectrographs ( uvs ) aboard the two _ voyager _",
    "spacecraft finding that the fuv sky was very patchy with both dark and bright regions .    in this work",
    ", we have used serendipitous observations from the _ far ultraviolet spectrographic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) under the s405/505 program to further probe the diffuse fuv sky .",
    "although _ fuse _  can not match the sensitivity of the _ voyager _",
    "uvs for observations of diffuse sources because of its relatively small field of view , we have , nevertheless , found many locations that do indeed have a strong enough signal to be detected by _",
    "fuse_. we concentrate here on presenting the overall results from our study and will discuss individual locations in detail in subsequent papers .",
    "the _ fuse _  spacecraft and mission has been described by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the instrument consists of four coaligned optical channels , two of which are coated with silicon carbide ( sic ) and two with lithium fluoride ( lif ) over aluminum providing coverage over the spectral range from 905  1187  .",
    "observations may be made through any of 3 apertures : the lwrs ( @xmath3 ) aperture ; the mdrs ( @xmath4 ) aperture ; and the hirs ( @xmath5 ) aperture . in principle",
    ", extended radiation will be visible in all 4 channels and through all the apertures but , in practice , only the brightest sources can be detected in any other than the lif lwrs channel .",
    "_ fuse _  was launched on june 24 , 1999 into a low earth orbit ( leo ) by a delta ii rocket and has been observing astronomical targets , mostly point sources , since then .",
    "the s405/505 program is intended to allow the _ fuse _  spectrographs to thermalize prior to a channel realignment . as such",
    ", these pointings are generally observations of blank sky near one of a number of alignment stars with exposure times on the order of a few thousand seconds .",
    "the complete list of pointings is available from the mast archive at stsci ( http://archive.stsci.edu ) and , of those , we have examined all that were available before sept 1 , 2003 .",
    "we downloaded the raw data and processed them using the standard calfuse pipeline ( v2.4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with two major modifications .",
    "the standard _ fuse _",
    "observation consists of a number of different exposures including both the `` day '' and the `` night '' part of the orbit . because of the faintness of the diffuse background , we used only the `` night '' photons , thereby eliminating most of the airglow lines other than the lyman lines of atmospheric hydrogen .",
    "there may still be residual amounts of the lines around 1040   and the lines at 1134   but these are generally weak and will not be a significant contributor to the continuum emission reported on here @xcite . finally , we combined the different exposures ( using the program _",
    "ttag_combine.c _ available as part of the standard _ fuse _  distribution ) .    we have found that the standard background subtraction considerably overestimates the instrumental background for the faint extended sources observed in this program and so , instead , empirically estimated the background from the counts in the detector just off the aperture and subtracted that from the spectrum . in most of the targets in this program , the signal was too faint to obtain a useful spectrum even though a diffuse continuum was clearly apparent to the eye .",
    "we , therefore , used the _ ttgd _ image of the detector plane ( step 19 from the calfuse pipeline reference guide 2002 : * ? ? ? * ) and integrated over bands selected to avoid the airglow lines ( table [ tbands ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ttagimg ] where we have shown an image of one of the detector segments ( 1a ) for the s4050201 observation .",
    "the two bands ( rows 1 and 2 ) of table [ tbands ] are shown as large boxes on either side of the lif lwrs ly @xmath6 feature .",
    "the enhancement due to the diffuse continuum is readily visible in the lif lwrs aperture , and , upon integration over the bands , all the apertures stand out over the background .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig . [ ttagimg ] where we have superimposed a cut across the image in which the data have been collapsed in the spectral direction over the right hand box of the figure ( columns 7500 - 15000 from row 2 of table [ tbands ] ) .",
    "although , in principle , a diffuse signal will be visible in all the apertures , we have used only the data from the lif lwrs aperture because its throughput is so much greater than the others . similarly , the data from the 2b detector do not add any any value to the diffuse sky determination because of its much lower sensitivity .",
    "llll 1 & lif 1a & 1100  6000 & 987.08  1020.77 + 2 & lif 1a & 7500  15000 & 1034.84  1081.37 + 3 & lif 1b & 2000  7000 & 1100.28  1133.69 + 4 & lif 1b & 7000  14000 & 1133.69  1180.07 + 5 & lif 2a & 2000  7000 & 1175.32  1141.97 + 6 & lif 2a & 9000  14000 & 1128.57  1095.03 + [ tbands ]    as we have seen from fig .",
    "[ ttagimg ] , the emission in the lif lwrs aperture , in particular , stands out from the background and we have replotted the signal in the immediate neighbourhood of the aperture in fig . [ profile ] .",
    "we have then fit this profile with a gaussian ( plus a background ) with uncertainties defined by the root mean square deviations adjacent to the aperture and found 90% confidence limits on the level of the diffuse background using the procedure of @xcite .",
    "those targets in which we have observed a diffuse astronomical signal are listed in table [ pos_det ] .",
    "the sensitivity limit of the _ fuse _  spectrographs to diffuse radiation is on the order of about 2000 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  and so the null detections are not interesting .    this procedure is tantamount to assuming that the instrumental background is the same in the aperture as off",
    ". there are several instrumental effects which may affect this , of which the most likely to be a problem is scattering in the spectral direction from the lyman lines of atmospheric .",
    "we have tested for this by plotting the observed signal against the counts under the ly @xmath6 line ( fig .",
    "[ lyb_fig ] ) for a representative sample and found no correlation between the astronomical and geocoronal lines .",
    "while there are other possibilities , we have found no evidence for any aperture dependent effects in our null detections  the signal is flat over the entire detector .",
    "perhaps the strongest argument for the quality of our background subtraction comes from the excellent agreement between different segments and different observations , separated in time by as much as a year and a half , in all of which the derived background agrees within the error bars .",
    "the only exception is s4055401 in which the background derived from segment 2a is much higher than the others .",
    "an examination of the raw data shows that the count rate is much higher at the beginning of each exposure suggesting contamination from daylight photons .",
    "the signal levels are so low that stellar contamination might be a serious problem . the sensitivity limit of 2000 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  corresponds to an unreddened b star of about @xmath7 magnitude in v. we have examined each of the fields using the digital sky survey ( dss ) plates and have rejected those few fields in which there were stars that were bright enough to possibly affect our determination of the diffuse background .",
    "most of these were in the smc or lmc where there are many hot bright stars , some of which did fall in the _ fuse _  fov .",
    "another test of stellar contamination comes from the much broader spread for a diffuse source , which fills the aperture , as opposed to a point source ( fig .",
    "[ ps_comp ] ) and we have confirmed that the spread for those sources identified as diffuse is really larger than that of a star . in practice ,",
    "there are few unreddened early - type stars in the sky and any stellar contribution in the _ fuse _  bandpass will be heavily depressed because of interstellar extinction . finally , we excluded those observations in which the pointing was particularly poor .",
    "we have also considered whether scattering from the nearby alignment star , which may be quite bright in the fuv , can contribute to the diffuse signal .",
    "the _ fuse _  instrument team has studied the scattered light from @xmath8 cas and found that the scattered light at a distance of 90  from the star is on the order of 7 @xmath9 the stellar flux ( personal communication : b .- g .",
    "anderson 2003 ) . even the brightest stars in our sample , with an observed intensity of @xmath10 ergs @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 , will not contribute more than 200 photons @xmath0",
    "sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  to the signal , much less than our sensitivity limit .",
    "of the 107 total observations ( 71 independent targets ) in the s405/505 program ( to our cutoff date ) , we have identified 45 ( 32 independent locations ) as unquestionable detections of a diffuse astronomical signal .",
    "these positive detections are listed in table [ pos_det ] and range in strength from 1600 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  to a maximum of @xmath11 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  ( in the orion nebular region ) .",
    "the brightest of these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fuse_spectra ] and show a variety of spectral shapes , perhaps indicative of the local radiation field . for instance , the scattered spectrum for s40546  a field in orion  is very similar to that of the nearby star hd36981 @xcite .",
    "we will discuss each of the individual regions in subsequent papers and concentrate on the global distribution of the diffuse background in this work .",
    "images and further description of each of the fields may be found at http://www.iiap.res.in/personnel/murthy/projects/fuse/fuse_background_analysis.html .",
    "there have been three studies of the uv/100  correlation in the near uv .",
    "@xcite found a ratio of 128 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  ( mjy sr@xmath1)@xmath1 for an isolated cirrus cloud at high galactic latitude using faust data ; @xcite found a latitude dependent ratio of between 60 ( b @xmath12 30 ) and 100 ( b @xmath12 15 ) photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  ( mjy sr@xmath1)@xmath1 using the nuviews instrument ; and @xcite found ratios varying between 30 and 300 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  ( mjy sr@xmath1)@xmath1 in _ midcourse space experiment _ ( _ msx _ )",

    "our corresponding data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fuse_ir ] with the flux from the 1b spectrum at an effective wavelength of 1058   ( mean wavelength for band 2 in table [ tbands ] ) plotted against the 100  flux from @xcite .",
    "although there is a trend of increasing fuv emission with increasing ir , there is considerable variation in the ratio ranging from only 28 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  ( mjy sr@xmath1)@xmath1 near the wolf - rayet star hd 92809 ( s40515 ) to 2800 photons @xmath0",
    "sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  ( mjy sr@xmath1)@xmath1 near the star hd36487 in orion ( s40545 ) .",
    "in fact , this variation should not be surprising .",
    "the uv signal arises from scattering of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) by interstellar dust and so depends heavily on the relative orientation of the stars and the dust , particularly in the fuv where there are only a relatively small number of bright stars which dominate the isrf . on the other hand ,",
    "the ir emission is due to the thermal emission from the heated interstellar dust and is not dependent on the direction of the incoming radiation .",
    "moreover , the optical depth in the uv is much higher than in the ir and saturation effects may be expected to become important even with low column densities of dust .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the only other major body of observations in the fuv are from observations made with the voyager uvx @xcite and we have plotted those data as well as the data in this work in an aitoff projection of the sky in fig .",
    "[ fuse_ait ] . in the figure ,",
    "the area of the circles is proportional to the observed surface brightness with the large open circle in orion corresponding to a surface brightness of @xmath13 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1 .",
    "note that we have not shown the _ fuse _",
    "null detections because the detection limit is too high to be useful . on the other hand ,",
    "the voyager null detections are at a level of only about 100 photons @xmath0",
    "sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  and are shown in the figure .",

    "it is clear from the data presented in this paper that the intensity and the spectrum of the diffuse radiation in the fuv does vary considerably over the sky .",
    "although other studies ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have claimed simple correlations between the diffuse uv radiation and tracers of interstellar dust such as 21 cm column densities or 100  intensities in the nuv , we can not support such from our data in the fuv .",
    "the optical depth of the interstellar dust is much higher in the fuv and it is possible that local effects are more important than in the nuv .",
    "thus we will defer modeling of our results to extract such important quantities as the optical properties of the interstellar dust grains .",
    "we have used serendipitous observations of blank sky with the _ fuse _  spacecraft to investigate the diffuse sky background in many areas over the sky . of the total 71 independent pointings ,",
    "we have observed a signal which we can unambiguously attribute to a diffuse background in 32 targets . considering that the s405/505 targets were chosen simply on the basis of a nearby alignment star and considering that _ fuse _  is only sensitive to signals of greater than 2000 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1 , this is a surprisingly large percentage .",
    "by contrast , in the _ voyager _  sample of @xcite only 63 of the total 426 targets have a flux of greater than 2000 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1 .",
    "of course , in neither case was an unbiased survey of the diffuse radiation field intended and it is likely that selection effects play an important role in these ratios .",
    "we have found that there is a trend of increasing fuv flux with the 100  flux indicating that the observed radiation is due to light scattered from the interstellar dust .",
    "however , the ratio between the fuv and the ir varies much more than was found by either @xcite or @xcite in the nuv .",
    "our targets are in quite different locations in the sky and it is apparent that local effects  such as exposure to the intense radiation field in orion  play an important role in determining the scattering of the stellar radiation .",
    "@xcite derived their ratio for a single isolated cirrus cloud while schiminovich et al . surveyed a large fraction of the sky .",
    "if we combine our data with the _ voyager _",
    "data of @xcite , we see that the fuv sky is quite patchy with intensities ranging from upper limits of less than 100 photons @xmath0 sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1  to intense regions as high as @xmath15 photons @xmath0",
    "sr@xmath1 s@xmath1 @xmath1 . these regions are scattered throughout the sky with both bright and faint regions being found at all latitudes , again suggesting that local effects dominate the fuv diffuse radiation field .",
