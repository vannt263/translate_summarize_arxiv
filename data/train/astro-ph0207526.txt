    "most theories of the early universe predict the temperature and polarisation fluctuations of the cmb to be gaussian distributed . in such models ,",
    "the angular temperature and polarisation power spectra contain all the information about the cosmological parameters which one can determine from observations of the cmb sky .",
    "as several combinations of the cosmological parameters can give rise to similar temperature power spectra , estimating the polarisation power spectra will break the degeneracy and will be of great importance for accurate estimation of cosmological parameters .",
    "also the error bars on these parameters can be reduced by exploiting the extra information present in the cmb polarisation power spectra .",
    "+ much effort has been made recently in order to find methods to analyse the cmb temperature power spectrum @xcite .",
    "there has been very few publications confronting the even harder task of estimating the polarisation power spectra .",
    "the framework for analysing the polarisation power spectra has been set in @xcite but these papers only describe the full likelihood method which is far too time consuming also when only considering the temperature power spectrum . in @xcite",
    "a quadratic polarisation power spectrum estimation method was introduced , similar to the one presented in @xcite for temperature only .",
    "+ in this paper we will extend the method of using the pseudo power spectrum as input to a likelihood estimation procedure of the power spectrum as described in @xcite ( from now on called hgh ) .",
    "we will include the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mode polarisation pseudo power spectra in the data vector and use techniques similar to those described in hgh to estimate the power spectra .",
    "this can be done because the kernels that connect the full sky polarisation power spectra with the polarisation pseudo power spectra on an apodised sky are similar to the kernel for the temperature power spectrum . in the first part of this paper",
    "we will derive the formulae for these kernels and for the polarisation pseudo power spectra and discuss their shapes .",
    "then in the second part this will be used for likelihood estimation .",
    "+ in this paper the @xmath2 component polarisation will mostly be neglected .",
    "the @xmath2 polarisation power spectrum is expected to be very small and will hardly be detectable by the upcoming @xmath3 or @xmath4 satellite experiments @xcite .",
    "also the @xmath0 and @xmath2 components of polarisation mix on the cut sky as will be discussed in this paper , making the @xmath2 polarisation pseudo spectrum to be dominated by the @xmath0 component @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will use the polarisation power spectra as they are defined in @xcite .",
    "there are three polarisation power spectra , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "these are defined as @xmath8 where the @xmath9 coefficients are given in appendix ( [ app : pseudopol ] ) . in the following when we write the full sky power spectrum @xmath10 for temperature or polarisation",
    ", we will always mean the ensemble averaged power spectrum @xmath11 . + as discussed in more detail in hgh , the gabor transformation of a dataset @xcite is just the fourier transformation of the dataset multiplied with a window function called the gabor window .",
    "the window function can be used to cut out parts of the dataset in order to study only smaller segments of the dataset at a time .",
    "the window can be a top - hat window , just setting the unwanted parts of the dataset to zero .",
    "another option is to use a function like a gaussian to smooth the edges between the segment which one wants to study and the parts which are set to zero in order to avoid ringing in the fourier spectrum . in hgh",
    "this formalism was extended to the sphere and used for cmb analysis .",
    "a disc on the cmb sky was cut out , using either a top - hat or a gaussian window .",
    "the gabor coefficients on this cut sky , called the pseudo power spectrum was expressed in terms of the full - sky power spectrum and the kernel connecting the full - sky and the cut - sky power spectrum was studied .",
    "the aim of this first section is to extend this to polarisation .",
    "+ when multiplying the polarisation map with a gabor window @xmath12 which is axissymmetric about the point @xmath13 , the pseudo spectra on this apodised cmb sky can be written in terms of the full - sky spectra as ( appendix [ app : pseudopol ] ) @xmath14 where the kernels @xmath15 and @xmath16 are given in appendix ( [ app : pseudopol ] ) .",
    "these kernels are expression in terms of the @xmath17 function which is defined similar to the @xmath18 function used to express the kernel for the temperature power spectrum in hgh . + as with the temperature kernels , the polarisation kernels can be evaluated either using the analytical wigner symbol expressions ( [ eq : kpm2 ] ) and ( [ eq : k0 ] ) or faster by direct integration and recursion of the @xmath17 functions . the recursion for the @xmath17 functions in appendix ( [ app : recpol ] ) is one of the major results in this paper .",
    "this is an extension of the recursion for @xmath18 derived in hgh .",
    "+ in appendix ( [ app : pseudopol ] ) and ( [ app : rotinv ] ) we show that the polarisation pseudo power spectra are rotationally invariant . for this reason we will in the rest of the paper put the centre of the gabor window on the north pole .",
    "this makes the calculations easier while keeping the generality of the results .",
    "+ in this section we will study the gabor kernel for a gaussian and a top - hat gabor window . the gaussian is defined as @xmath19 where we will use @xmath20 and @xmath21 degrees fwhm ( corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and a cut - off angle @xmath24 .",
    "we will also be comparing with a top - hat window covering the same area on the sky ( @xmath25 is the same ) .",
    "the top - hat window is defined as @xmath26    studying equation ( [ eq : pcle ] ) and ( [ eq : pclb ] ) one sees that the @xmath0 and @xmath2 modes are mixing when only a portion of the sky is observed .",
    "the kernel @xmath27 is the kernel which takes full sky @xmath5 modes to the pseudo coefficients @xmath28 and similarly for @xmath6 .",
    "the kernel @xmath29 is the one which causes the mixing . in figure ( [ fig : k2g5 ] ) and ( [ fig : k2g15 ] ) we have plotted the kernels @xmath27 together with @xmath29 for a @xmath20 and @xmath21 degree fwhm gaussian gabor window with @xmath24 .",
    "one can see that the diagonal of the @xmath27 kernel is about an order of magnitude larger than the diagonal of the mixing kernel @xmath29 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 would dominate @xmath30 and @xmath6 would dominate @xmath31 provided that the two spectra @xmath5 and @xmath6 were of the same order of magnitude .",
    "however as discussed before , the @xmath6 are expected to be considerably smaller than @xmath5 in most cosmological models . for the @xmath0 mode",
    "this is not a problem as @xmath5 will then hardly be affected .",
    "the problem is the @xmath2 mode which in this case will be dominated by the @xmath0 mode .",
    "+    the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath2 modes of polarisation on the cut sky was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will in this paper assume that the @xmath2 mode polarisation component is neglible , but note that a possible extension of the power spectrum estimation method outlined here to @xmath2 mode polarisation would be to define @xmath32 with the corresponding pseudo quantities @xmath33 written in terms of the @xmath34 functions defined in appendix ( [ app : pseudopol ] ) .",

    "when going from smaller to larger windows , the diagonals get sharper .",
    "also the tophat kernels have more long range correlations than the gaussian kernels ( note that all the plots have the same vertical scale and can be compared directly ) .",
    "+ in figure ( [ fig : polcutg ] ) we have plotted slices of the different kernels at @xmath40 for comparison .",
    "the slices are made of the kernels for @xmath20 and @xmath21 degree fwhm gaussian gabor windows .",

    "for this reason the relation shown in hgh between the width of the kernel and the width of the size of the window for the temperature power spectrum is also valid for polarisation .",
    "this is an important result to be used for the likelihood estimation of the polarisation power spectra in the next section .",
    "it shows that the number of polarisation pseudo spectrum coefficients to be used in the likelihood analysis should be the same as for the likelihood estimation of the temperature power spectrum .",
    "+ in figure ( [ fig : polcutth ] ) a similar plot is shown for the corresponding tophat windows .",
    "the plot shows that the conclusions made for the gaussian windows are also valid in this case . the shape and size of the three kernels are the same around the diagonal .",
    "for this reason the results shown for the temperature kernel that the tophat window has larger long range correlations whereas the gaussian window has large short range correlations and therefore a wider kernel is also valid for polarisation .",
    "+    the kernel @xmath29 which mixes the @xmath0 and @xmath2 modes on the cut sky is plotted as a dashed line in figures ( [ fig : polcutg ] ) and ( [ fig : polcutth ] ) .",
    "it is much smaller than the three other kernels and the shape seems to differ as well .",
    "note that the height of the mixing kernel relative to the other kernels is lower for the @xmath21 degree window than for the @xmath20 degree window .",
    "that the size of the mixing kernel relative to the other kernels is dropping when the size of the window is increasing was to be expected since in the limit of full sky coverage the @xmath0-@xmath2 mixing disappears and the mixing kernel must go to zero .",
    "+ in figure ( [ fig : km2cutg ] ) a slice at @xmath40 of the temperature kernel and the mixing kernel is shown for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 degree fwhm gaussian gabor window .",
    "the kernels are normalised to one at the peak so that the shapes can be compared . for the gaussian window",
    ", the shapes of the kernels still seem to be the same .",
    "but the kernels for the corresponding tophat windows shown in figure ( [ fig : km2cutth ] ) does not have a gaussian shape and differs significantly from the other kernels .",
    "+    since the kernels for the polarisation power spectra have a shape similar to that of the temperature power spectrum the effect of a gabor window on the shape of the power spectrum should also be similar .",
    "this can be seen in figure ( [ fig : pcle ] ) and ( [ fig : pclc ] ) .",
    "the figures show the full sky polarisation power spectra ( dashed line ) @xmath42 ( figure [ fig : pcle ] ) and @xmath43 ( figure [ fig : pclc ] ) for a standard cdm model . in this model",
    "the @xmath2 component of polarisation is zero . on top of the full sky power spectra",

    "the pseudo spectra for the corresponding tophat windows are plotted as dotted lines .",
    "as expected the shape of the polarisation pseudo spectra relative to the full sky spectra is similar to that for the temperature spectrum shown in hgh .",
    "one difference is that the polarisation pseudo spectra for the gaussian window do not have the characteristic extra peak at low multipole which is seen in the temperature pseudo spectrum .",
    "this peak in the temperature spectrum arose due to the steep @xmath44 fall - off of the temperature spectrum at low multipole .",
    "the polarisation spectra do not have this steep fall - off and for this reason there is no extra peak .",
    "+     +    because of the mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath2 modes there is also a @xmath2 polarisation component @xmath31 for the pseudo spectrum even when the input full sky @xmath6 were zero .",
    "this is shown in figure ( [ fig : pclb ] ) where we have plotted the full sky spectrum @xmath5 and the pseudo spectra @xmath45 for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 degree fwhm gaussian gabor windows and corresponding tophat windows .",
    "the pseudo spectra are normalised so that they can be compared directly to the full sky spectrum .",
    "the dashed lines show the pseudo spectra for the gaussian window .",

    "as expected the size of the @xmath2 component is dropping with increasing window size .",
    "the @xmath31 for the tophat windows are plotted as dotted lines .",
    "the shape of the pseudo spectra @xmath31 for the gaussian windows are roughly following the shape of the full sky @xmath5 .",
    "this could be expected because the mixing kernel @xmath29 for the gaussian window has a gaussian shape close to the diagonal , similar to the other kernels ( see figure ( [ fig : km2cutg ] ) ) .",
    "the pseudo spectra @xmath6 for the tophat windows however are much smoother due to the much broader kernel ( figure [ fig : km2cutth ] ) .    in the same way as for the temperature power spectrum",
    ", we have shown that the polarisation pseudo spectra resemble the full sky polarisation spectra when the patches on the sky are large enough .",
    "this motivates the use of the polarisation pseudo power spectra as input to a likelihood estimation of the polarisation power spectra in the same way as for the temperature power spectrum showed in hgh . to do likelihood analysis one needs to find theoretical expressions for the correlations between different @xmath46 ( z=\\{t , e , c } )",
    "in hgh a gaussian likelihood ansatz with the pseudo power spectrum as the input data was successfully used to estimate the power spectrum . because of the similarities between the kernels of the polarisation power spectra and the temperature power spectrum we can assume that this works for the estimation of the polarisation power spectra as well .",
    "we will now show the results of some monte carlo simulations confirming this assumption . in this section",
    "we will assume that the @xmath2 component of polarisation is so small that it can be neglected .",
    "we will only concentrate on the @xmath47 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 components as in most standard theories of the early universe the @xmath2 component will be too small to be measured by the map and planck satellite experiments @xcite .",
    "+ in figure ( [ fig : probpcleg5 ] ) and ( [ fig : probpclcg5 ] ) we have plotted the probability distribution of the @xmath30 and @xmath48 from 10000 simulations . the probability distribution ( histogram ) is plotted on top of a gaussian ( dashed line ) with mean and fwhm taken from the theoretical expressions derived in appendix ( [ app : polcormat ] ) . in these simulations",
    "we were using a @xmath20 degree fwhm gaussian gabor window with @xmath24 . in figure ( [ fig : probpcleg15 ] ) and ( [ fig : probpclcg15 ] ) we show the results of similar simulations with a @xmath21 degree fwhm gaussian gabor window . as expected the trend is that the distributions get more and more gaussian for higher multipoles and for bigger windows . for the @xmath49 fwhm window ,",
    "the distribution is very close to a gaussian for the multipoles above @xmath50 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : probpcleth15 ] ) and ( [ fig : probpclcth15 ] ) show the probability distribution for a tophat window covering the same area on the sky as the gaussian window used in figure ( [ fig : probpcleg15 ] ) and ( [ fig : probpclcg15 ] ) .",
    "also this distribution is very close to a gaussian .",
    "+    the previous plots have shown that a gaussian likelihood ansatz for the polarisation pseudo spectra seems to be a very good approximation provided that the window is big enough .",
    "as for the temperature spectrum , the approximation is no longer valid for the lowest multipoles , but as was shown for the temperature power spectrum , this might only give rise to a very small downward bias for the estimates of the lowest multipoles .",
    "+ the form of the log - likelihood to minimise is therefore still @xmath51 where the data vector now consists of the temperature and polarisation power spectra @xmath52 . here",

    "+    for fast likelihood estimation , it is crucial that one can calculate the average pseudo spectra @xmath59 and correlation matrix @xmath56 fast .",
    "the formalism in hgh which enabled fast calculations of these quantities for the temperature power spectrum is extended to polarisation in appendix ( [ app : polcormat ] ) ( signal ) and appendix ( [ app : polnoise ] ) ( noise ) .    in figure ( [ fig : corttee ] )",
    "we have plotted the signal correlation matrix @xmath60 next to the matrix @xmath61 .",
    "a standard cdm power spectrum without @xmath2 mode polarisation was used .",
    "the two matrices are very similar .",
    "one big difference is that the matrix for @xmath0 mode polarisation is missing the wall at low multipoles present in the temperature matrix . as discussed before this is because of the different shapes for the @xmath47 and @xmath0 power spectra at low multipoles .",
    "the temperature power spectrum drops steeply at low @xmath62 while this is not the case for the @xmath0 mode polarisation spectrum .",
    "+    in figures ( [ fig : corcctc ] ) and ( [ fig : corteec ] ) the @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 matrices are shown .",
    "all matrices are diagonally dominant and since the values on the diagonals all have the same order of magnitude , they all have to be included in the total matrix @xmath67 .",
    "the likelihood estimation was carried out in the same way as for the temperature power spectrum .",
    "as discussed in hgh , when we observe the cut - sky we do not have enough information to estimate the full - sky @xmath10 for all multipoles .",
    "one has to estimate the @xmath10 in @xmath68 bins .",
    "also , the @xmath69 coefficients are not independent on the cut sky , so a limited number @xmath70 of pseudo spectrum coefficients have to be used as input to the likelihood .",
    "how many multipoles depends on the width @xmath71 of the gabor kernel for a given window which is discussed in more detail in hgh .",
    "+ the power spectra were estimated in bins defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the first multipole in bin @xmath74 .",
    "a similar binning does not work for for the temperature - polarisation cross correlation power spectrum .",
    "the reason for this is the schwarz inequality @xmath75 . during likelihood",
    "maximisation one must make sure that the estimated value of @xmath7 never exceeds @xmath76 .",
    "the way we solved this problem was to estimate for @xmath77 under the constraint that this value never exceeds @xmath78 .",
    "so the binning is then @xmath79 where as before @xmath80 .",
    "+ as an example we simulated a sky using @xmath81 resolution in healpix @xcite and a @xmath82 beam .",
    "we added non - uniform noise to the map .",
    "a reasonable assumption about the size of the noise deviations for polarisation is to take @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "this is what we used in this test , but note that the formalism do not require any relation between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the noise level was set so that the signal to noise ration for the temperature power spectrum was always well above @xmath78 below the maximum multipole @xmath86 whereas for the @xmath0 mode polarisation power spectrum it was mostly below @xmath78 ( see figure ( [ fig : polpclnoavg ] ) ) .",
    "this is close to the values expected for the planck hfi @xmath87 @xcite channel . for the analysis we used a @xmath21 degree gaussian gabor window .",
    "the result of one single estimation is shown in figure ( [ fig : polpclnoavg ] ) . in this estimation",
    "we used @xmath88 pseudo spectrum multipoles as input and estimated for @xmath89 multipole bins for each of the @xmath47 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes .",
    "+ to test whether the method is bias or not , we did 60 monte carlo simulations .",
    "the result of the average of these simulations is shown in figure ( [ fig : polpcl ] ) .",
    "the method seems to be unbiased also for the estimates of the polarisation power spectra .",
    "note that the expected noise variance taken from the often used analytic formula for uniform noise ( shaded areas on the plot ) given in @xcite and hgh here fails to predict the size of the error bars on the estimates .",
    "the expected variance taken from the inverse fisher matrix ( dashed lines ) fits better with the error bars from monte carlo .",
    "the reason is that we used a noise profile with increasing noise from the centre of the disc and down to the edges , opposite of the gaussian window .",
    "this gives the observation with high @xmath90 higher significance in the analysis .",
    "this is similar to a result for the temperature power spectrum discussed further in hgh .",
    "we have presented a maximum likelihood method to simultaneously estimate the temperature and polarisation power spectra from high resolution cmb data in the presence of non - uniform noise and a symmetric gabor window .",
    "an extension of the power spectrum estimation method developed in hgh has been made in order to estimate for the polarisation power spectra in addition to the temperature power spectrum . in most standard theories for the early universe",
    ", the @xmath2 component polarisation will be too small to be observed by the map and planck experiments .",
    "for this reason , the method has been tested here under the assumption that the @xmath2 mode polarisation is negligible . in this case",
    "the method appears to give unbiased estimates of the polarisation power spectra also in the presence of non - uniform noise and a gabor window .",
    "+ the kernels connecting the full sky polarisation power spectra with the cut sky polarisation pseudo power spectra were studied and found to be very similar to the kernel for the temperature power spectrum . for this reason",
    "the effect of a cut sky and a gabor window on the polarisation power spectra is similar to the effect on the temperature power spectrum .",
    "this explains that the method of estimating the power spectrum from the pseudo power spectrum for polarisation was as successful as it was for temperature .",
    "+ one issue which has not been studied fully here is the inclusion of the @xmath2 mode polarisation .",
    "we demonstrated that the @xmath0 and @xmath2 mode polarisation power spectra are mixing on the cut sky making detections of the much weaker @xmath2 component difficult .",
    "further work needs to be done in order to include the @xmath2 component in the likelihood analysis .",
    "+ in hgh it was discussed how one can find the noise correlation matrix for temperature using monte carlo .",
    "this might be faster than the analytical approach presented here when the size of the dataset is very huge . with a sufficient number of monte carlo simulations this",
    "was shown to give similar error bars as the analytic treatment .",
    "the results for the temperature noise matrix is expected to be valid also for the polarisation noise matrices and can be used when the dataset is so big that the monte - carlo approach is significantly faster , or when correlated noise is present .",
    "+ another extension which was discussed in hgh was the simultaneous analysis of several patches on the cmb sky .",
    "this extension was shown to work for the temperature power spectrum and we expect that this could work also for polarisation , allowing data from several different experiments to be analysed together . in hgh",
    "it was shown that with this power spectrum estimation method , huge datasets like the ones to be expected from map or planck can be analysed in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "the most time - consuming step in the method is the construction of the correlation matrix , which in the case of polarisation is 9 times longer .",
    "this makes also the joint temperature and polarisation power spectrum estimation feasible for huge datasets .",
