    "face - to - face meeting has been necessary for effective communication , but time , financial cost , and also environmental concerns are becoming less tolerable . with the advent of network and multimedia technologies , virtual meeting has become increasingly popular to enable more frequent and less costly person - to - person communication .",
    "however , most traditional virtual meeting systems in both business and consumer spaces such as skype or cisco webex still provide rather limited and sometimes unsatisfying functionalities and hardly maintain the experience of an in - person meeting .",
    "for instance , the separate displays of remote participants fail to provide a sense of co - location as in face - to - face meetings , while their poor integration with the shared collaborative contents and virtual environments leads to limited non - verbal cues and interaction among them . to address these issues , tele - immersive ( ti ) systems with the vision of providing natural user experiences and interaction",
    "have attracted many research interests in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "high - end telepresence products such as cisco telepresence  @xcite and hp s hallo are designed to create the perception of meeting in the same physical space , which demand a proprietary installation and high - cost setup .",
    "recently , some 3d tele - immersive ( ti ) systems have been developed to enhance the remote collaboration by presenting remote participants into the same 3d virtual space  @xcite .",
    "however , these systems still fall short of stimulating a face - to - face collaboration with the presence of shared contents .",
    "also , requiring bulky and expensive hardware with nontrivial calibration and setup hinders their wide deployment in real life .",
    "[ pt ]     required hardware and various setups of the item system . ( a )  microphone array .",
    "( b )  item system setup with microphone array and depth camera .",
    "( c )  item system setup with webcam .",
    "( all the figures in this paper are best viewed in color . ) ]    motivated by these challenges and more , we present in this paper an immersive telepresence system for entertainment and meetings ( item ) based on a low - cost , flexible setup ( e.g. a webcam and/or a depth camera , an optional low - cost microphone array , a desktop / laptop connected to the public internet ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the system allows putting two or more remote participants into the same virtual space and seamlessly integrating them with any shared collaborative contents for a more natural person - to - person interaction . with an addition of a depth camera and a low - cost microphone array , item supports spatialized 3d audio , active speaker detection , and gesture - based controls to reproduce nonverbal signals and interactions with the shared contents in an intuitive and effective manner .",
    "this paper describes a complete design and implementation of such a system by addressing the challenges in the whole pipeline of media processing , communication , and displaying .",
    "we consider major practical requirements in our design to build a system that supports _ multimodality _ ( audio / video , shared contents ) , _ scalability _ for a large number of participants and concurrent meetings , _ flexibility _ in a system setup ( 2d color webcam and/or 3d depth camera ) , and desirable _ functionality _ to best suit different application contexts . taking a systematic and integrated approach , we seamlessly combine various key components from the high - quality video object cutout , efficient media coding delivery , 3d sound source capture and localization , and immersive composition to improve system performance and enhance immersive experience . as an end result , we present several interesting applications and user experiences created by item .",
    "in summary , we particularly focus on the system aspects in building such a lightweight practical ti system that maximizes the end - user experience , optimizes the system and network resources , and enables a variety of teleimmersive application scenarios .",
    "our major effort is to investigate and optimize the key system components , individually and collectively , and efficient end - to - end integration by taking user needs and preferences into consideration .",
    "the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows    * an end - to - end optimized practical ti system using inexpensive and widely available hardware ( e.g. common video peripherals and cpus ) * a fine - tuned object - based fast video coding technique for real world data * spatialized audio capture and 3d sound localization using a low - cost microphone array for group teleconferencing * detailed objective and subjective evaluation for extensive user study of this first lightweight ti system .    as a result , the proposed item system advances the state of the art ti systems in four major and unique ways    * a low - cost and simple setup for minimal deployment requirement of a real - time ti system . *",
    "stimulate immersive experience in the same environment and sense of being together for remote participants . * new user experiences in group teleconferencing created by the microphone array and its seamless integration with the visual processing .",
    "* reduce the computation load and bandwidth requirement by a factor of 3 to 4 compared to existing ti systems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the literature review of the state - of - the - art immersive telepresence systems .",
    "we present in section iii the overview and architecture design of the proposed item system , while the key developed technologies are discussed in section iv .",
    "section v presents the proposed fast object based coding component of the item system . in section",
    "vi , we present the proposed 3d audio capturing and localization technology for group teleconferencing . the system performances are shown in section vii . in section viii",
    ", we briefly discuss several immersive applications and user experiences created by item .",
    "section ix provides the concluding remarks .",
    "a preliminary version of this work has been presented in  @xcite .",

    "this section presents the potential utilization of item to enhance the communication experience and effectiveness in various business and consumer solutions through an appropriate configuration and customization to meet the practical requirements of application scenarios .",
    "these potential applications share the same unique and key added feature provided by item where all remote parties are put in a same shared environment , stimulating sense of being together .      stimulating in - person meeting characteristics ( e.g. interaction among participants and collaborative contents with a sense of belonging to the same place ) with scalability support",
    "is the critical element for effective tele - meeting .",
    "we discuss here some choices when configuring and customizing item to realize such required characteristics . for networking structure ,",
    "we use the decentralized ad - hoc structure to : 1 ) easily support concurrent meeting scalability , and 2 ) reduce total bandwidth within a session .",
    "furthermore , item supports a variety of collaborative contents from slides , documents , media - rich contents , and even desktop windows through the meta channel . to support ti functionalities , we currently customize two rendering modes to naturally put participants in the same designed virtual meeting space or shared contents , allowing participants a freedom to navigate around ( fig .  [",
    "fig : meeting ] ) .",
    "_ presentation mode : _ the active speaker is segmented and immersively merged with the shared contents . _",
    "discussion mode : _ without any shared contents , the entire remote room is displayed with the active speaker in focus and the blurring effect for other participants .",
    "we have deployed our system for the internal trials and collected some initial useful feedbacks .",
    "users like the virtual meeting room design that gives them a strong sense of presence in the same physical space without any distracting , private backgrounds .",
    "although users are not fully satisfied with the current layout in the content sharing mode when having many remote participants , this mode is often preferred due to the need of sharing collaborative contents during a meeting and its effectiveness for conveying the gesture signals to the shared contents .",
    "it is observed that when there is a single participant at a location , the user prefers a simple setup of a webcam without the need of using a depth camera for the gesture - based control .",
    "users liked the speaker detection and immersive visual composition features in the presentation mode .",
    "they felt the quality of the meeting was more effective with the ease to keep track of both the slide contents and the speaker video at the same time .",
    "they commented that the engagement of the active speaker with the shared contents also led to a more effective presentation and discussion .",
    "the survey results also show that the 3d audio reproduction feature was more useful in the discussion mode than the presentation mode . in the presentation mode ,",
    "the main focus was usually on the shared contents and the current speaker .",
    "therefore , users commented that they did not strongly perceive and pay much attention to the spatialized audio .",
    "[ t ]      fusion of users into the shared contents and virtual spaces in real time offers a variety of uses in distance learning and education . by merging a lecturer into the course materials , the gesture signals of a lecturer and her interactions with the slides",
    "are easily perceived as in a physical classroom , which is an important factor for an effective e - learning course . inviting another lecturer from a different location to join and discuss during a live lecture",
    "is made possible by simply adding her as an active item client . in a long - distance training course ( e.g. yoga or rehabilitation )",
    ", a proper rendering mode is designed to effectively put participants in a virtual class room , allowing a learner to easily see and follow the trainer s movement that is hardly feasible or effective with the existing commodity video communication systems .",
    "when natural interaction with the course contents or full - body tracking is required , a depth camera is recommended for the active item participants . to support a large number of students ( passive item participants ) in an e - course ,",
    "multicast - based networking structure is employed . for the case of yoga or rehabilitation training or a small virtual class room requiring interactive collaborations ,",
    "the decentralized ad - hoc structure is employed instead .",
    "we have deployed item as a light - weight tele - immersive video chat application to bring fun , exciting additions to the video chat experience . the system allows friends and long - distance family members to experience a sense of togetherness by creating a virtual space to let them see , interact , and do something fun together .",
    "being able to separate an user from the background , the application lets users change the background , swap in another , and apply cool , fun video effects such as blurring the background or stylizing the user video ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cutout ] - bottom - right image ) . with a similar , simple setup as any video chat application in the consumer space",
    ", our application creates endless exciting uses with just one click from sharing vacation photos , covering up a messy room , pretending at some places , or hiding someone else who is watching and listening .",
    "we have also allowed users easily creating a fun , immersive video clip and share with friends and relatives on social networks . creating a photo , video clip with all family members becomes easier than ever regardless of their distant locations .",
    "we have demonstrated our application at various technical festivals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mp1 ] ) and conducted user experience surveys .",
    "the results show users like this new feature of instantly sharing something fun , exciting as the background while conducting video chats at the same time .",
    "they are impressed by the real - time segmentation of foreground at high quality from live videos , feeling that his / her webcam has been transformed into an intelligent one magically .",
    "users also really enjoy the immersive video chat features , in which they feel more tightly connected with remote friends and selected background contents .",
    "being simple and fun , the application attracts much attention from users ( especially children ) and gets them involved longer in a long - distance video chat .",
    "we find this observation is consistent with a recent hci study  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the complete design and realization of an immersive telepresence system for entertainment and meetings based on truly commodity capturing , computing , and networking setups .",
    "we addressed the challenges in the key components of the proposed item system , but also exploited the synergy between different modules to maximize the overall system performance .",
    "we objectively demonstrated how to design and fit all components with the stress of computing resources and different application requirements .",
    "the realization of the item system is indeed a proof of feasibility for such a lightweight practical system , in which the performance is verified through field trials .",
    "this allowed us an opportunity to conduct an extensive evaluation of user experience both objectively and subjectively .",
    "our future plan is to further improve the current system and related key technology to ultimately make the ti system practical and accessible to massive users .",
    "in fact , the constructed ti system could also be served as an open platform for the community to develop and integrate the related novel technologies for the key system components , which include but are not limited to video object cutout , networking , and visual presentation . for this purpose",
    ", we plan to release the back - bone system software under a free software license .",
