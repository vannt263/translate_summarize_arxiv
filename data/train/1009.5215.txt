    "dense plasmas composed of ions , degenerate electrons , positrons , and/or holes ( in the context of semiconductors ) are referred to as quantum plasmas . in the latter , the degeneracy of the lighter plasma species ( electrons , positrons , holes ) appears at very high densities and relatively low temperatures , where the mean inter - particle distance is smaller than ( or of the same order as ) the de broglie thermal wavelength .",
    "the ions are typically non - degenerate due to their relatively large mass in comparison with the electron mass . in quantum physics , heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite dictates that conjugate variables , such as the position and momentum of a particle can not be precisely determined simultaneously ; the product of the uncertainties of the position and momentum is equal to or larger than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ) is planck s constant divided by @xmath3 .",
    "the position of an electron subjected to the influence of an atomic nucleus is very well defined ( the force to which it is subjected is large ) .",
    "however , owing to heisenberg s uncertainty principle , the electron momentum is ill defined .",
    "an electron has a continuous motion around the position it occupies .",
    "this motion exerts pressure on the surrounding medium , exactly as the thermal agitation of the particles of a gas exerts its pressure .",
    "this pressure is called the electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "this pressure , since it is nonthermal in origin , is , of course , independent of the electron temperature ; the pressure of degenerate electrons increases with increasing electron number density .",
    "it is , however , only at very high densities that the degeneracy pressure becomes comparable or larger to the thermal gas pressure .",
    "one then says that the plasma matter is in an exotic state , comprising degenerate electrons and positrons or holes .",
    "plasmas with degenerate electrons and positrons with number densities comparable with solids and temperatures of several electron volts fall under the category of dense matter @xcite that appears in the core of giant planets @xcite and the crusts of old stars @xcite .",
    "dense compressed plasmas are currently of wide interest due to their applications to astrophysical and cosmological environments @xcite , as well as to inertial fusion science involving intense laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments @xcite for inertial confinement fusion @xcite based on the high - energy density plasma physics @xcite .",
    "plasma - like collective behavior is well studied experimentally and theoretically in solid state physics @xcite , in which metals and semi - conductors support both transverse optical modes , and longitudinal electrostatic modes , such as plasmons and phonons on electron and ion time - scales , and , in addition various lattice modes .",
    "plasmons and phonons are usually probed by measuring the energy of electrons which have been passed through thin foils , or by laser scattering techniques .",
    "for example , the dispersion relation of collective electron plasma waves has been measured for several metal specimen by using an electron velocity analyzer of mllenstedt type @xcite .",
    "collective dispersive behavior of plasmons , including shifts in the plasmon frequency due to quantum effects , in solid - density plasmas have been observed by @xcite and @xcite using spectrally resolved x - ray scattering techniques @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "powerful x - ray sources are employed for accessing narrow bandwidth spectral lines via collective thomson scattering of light off electron - density fluctuations .",
    "these experimental techniques also allow accurate measurements of the electron velocity distribution function , temperature , and ionization state in the dense matter regime .",
    "@xcite also proposed future experiments to measure low - frequency oscillations in plasmas when kev free - electron lasers will become available . @xcite",
    "summarizes the measurement techniques using scattering of em waves in plasmas , and recent experimental results from x - ray scattering experiments in dense plasmas reveal that quantum mechanical effects are indeed important @xcite .    furthermore , due to recent experimental progress in femtosecond pump - probe spectroscopy ,",
    "the field of quantum plasmas is also gaining significant attention @xcite in connection with the collective dynamics of an ensemble of degenerate electrons in metallic nanostructures and thin metal films .",

    "the latter can be used as nanoscale magnetic switches .",
    "collective interactions between an ensemble of degenerate electrons and positrons / holes give rise to novel waves and structures in quantum plasmas .",
    "studies of linear waves in a non - relativistic unmagnetized quantum plasma with degenerate electrons begun with the pioneering theoretical works of @xcite and @xcite , who studied the dispersion properties of high - frequency electron plasma oscillations ( epos ) .",
    "the frequencies of the latter with an arbitrary electron degeneracy have been found by @xcite . in the theoretical description of the epos ,",
    "klimontovich - silin and bohm - pines used the wigner distribution function @xcite and the density matrix approach to demonstrate that in a quantum plasma with a fermi - dirac equilibrium distribution function for degenerate electrons , the frequency of the epos is significantly different from the bohm - gross frequency in a classical electron - ion plasma with non - degenerate electrons obeying the maxwell - boltzmann distribution function .",
    "the dispersion to the epos appears through the electron fermi pressure and electron tunneling effects @xcite .",
    "the quantum bohm potential , responsible for electron tunneling , appeared first in the quantum fluid description of a single electron by @xcite and @xcite . for systems of degenerate electrons , different forms of the potential",

    "@xcite studied the dispersive properties of a magnetized quantum plasma by using the wigner distribution function and the maxwell equations .",

    "one thus has the coupled nls and poisson equations , governing the dynamics of nonlinearly interacting epos is a quantum plasma .",
    "both non - relativistic qhd and nls - poisson equations exclude strong interactions among the quantum particles and electron exchange interactions @xcite between an electron and the background plasma particles ( e.g. degenerate electrons and non - degenerate ions ) .",
    "however , it has turned out that the qhd and nls - poisson equations have been quite useful for studying linear and nonlinear plasma waves , as well as stability of quantum plasmas @xcite at nanoscales involving the quantum force @xcite and the quantum statistical pressure law for an unmagnetized quantum plasma with degenerate electrons",

    "we first describe the salient properties of quantum plasmas in which degenerate electrons follow the fermi - dirac distribution .",

    "specifically , we discuss the formation and dynamics of nanostructures ( e.g. 1d quantum electron density cavity and 2d quantum vortices ) , as well as discuss the properties of 3d quantum electron fluid turbulence at nanoscales .",

    "the effects of an external magnetic field on linear and nonlinear wave phenomena in a quantum magnetoplasma are examined .",
    "finally , we highlight possible applications , as well as future perspectives and outlook of nonlinear quantum plasma physics .",
    "let us first summarize some of the basic properties of quantum plasmas that are quite distinct from classical plasmas . while classical plasmas are composed of non - degenerate plasma particles with low number densities and relatively high electron and ion temperatures , quantum plasmas have degenerate electrons and/or positrons with extremely high number densities and relatively low temperatures .",

    "the typical timescale for electron - ion ( lattice ) collisions is @xmath56 fs , which is one order of magnitude greater than the electron plasma period .",

    "the mean distance @xmath57 between electrons become comparable to the compton length @xmath58 , and accordingly the speed of an electron on the fermi surface becomes comparable to the speed of light @xmath59 in vacuum , so that one has to take relativistic effects into account .",

    "the interior of white dwarf stars usually consists of fully ionized helium , carbon , and oxygen , which approximately consist of equal amounts of protons and neutrons .",
