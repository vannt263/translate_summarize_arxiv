    "since the discovery of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows there has been growing evidence linking grbs to massive stars : the host galaxies of grbs are star - forming galaxies and the position of grbs appear to trace the blue light of young stars @xcite ; some of the host galaxies appear to be dusty with star - formation rates comparable to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies @xcite . on smaller spatial scales ,",
    "there is growing evidence tying grbs to regions of high ambient density @xcite and the so - called dark grbs arise in or behind regions of high extinction @xcite .",
    "however , the most direct evidence linking grbs to massive stars comes from observations of underlying supernovae ( sne ) and x - ray lines .",
    "the presence of x - ray lines would require a significant amount of matter on stellar scales ( e.g. @xcite ) , as may be expected in models involving the death of massive stars .",
    "however , to date , these detections ( e.g. @xcite ) have not been made with high significance .",
    "if grbs do arise from the death of massive stars , then it is reasonable to expect associated sne .",
    "the grb - sn link was observationally motivated by two discoveries : the association of grb  980425 with the peculiar type ic sn 1998bw @xcite and an excess of red light superposed on the rapidly decaying afterglow of grb  980326 @xcite .",
    "however , these two discoveries were not conclusive .",
    "the sn association would require grb  980425 to be extra - ordinarily under - energetic as compared to all other cosmologically located grbs and the case for grb 980326 is weakened by the lack of a redshift for the grb or the host galaxy .    nonetheless , the two discoveries motivated searches for similar underlying sn components .",
    "as summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , suggestions of similar red `` bumps '' in the light curves of various other grb afterglows have been made ( to varying degrees of confidence ) .    however , there is little dispute that the well - studied red bump in the afterglow of grb  011121 is most easily explained by an underlying supernova @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from radio and ir observations of the afterglow @xcite , there is excellent evidence that the circumburst medium was inhomogeneous with ambient density @xmath2 , as expected from a massive star progenitor @xcite ; here , @xmath3 is the distance from the progenitor .",
    "these developments are in accordance with the expectation of the `` collapsar '' model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the core of a rotating massive star collapses to a black hole which then accretes matter and drives a relativistic jet .",
    "internal shocks within this jet first cause bursts of @xmath4-rays and then subsequently result in afterglow emission as the jet shocks the ambient medium .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the sn light is primarily powered by radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized @xmath5ni whereas the burst of @xmath4-rays are powered by the activity of the central engine . in the current generation of collapsar models",
    ", there is sufficient flexibility to allow for a large dispersion of @xmath5ni and the energy of the engine .",
    "thus , the next phase of understanding the grb - sn connection will benefit from ( and require ) observational measures of these parameters .",
    "motivated thus , we have an ongoing program of searches for sne in grb afterglows with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) . here",
    ", we present a systematic search for a sn underlying grb  010921 . in  [ sec : observations ] we present our observations and the details of photometry in  [ sec : subphot ] .",
    "we fit afterglow models and constrain the brightness of an underlying sn in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we then present an overview of previous such efforts and conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "grb  010921 was detected by the high energy transient explorer ( hete-2 ) satellite at 2001 september 21.219 ut @xcite and the position was refined by the interplanetary network error - box @xcite . using the 5-m hale telescope and the very large array we discovered the afterglow of this event as well as the redshift of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the low redshift of this event , @xmath6 , made it a prime candidate for a search for an underlying sn .",
    "accordingly , as a part of our large _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) cycle 9 program ( go-8867 , p.  i. : kulkarni ) , we triggered a series of observations with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard hst .",
    "owing to the lateness in identifying the afterglow candidate , the first observation was on day 35 , slightly after the expected peak of the sn . at each of epochs 13 we obtained @xmath7  s exposures in each of five filters ( f450w , f555w , f702w , f814w and f850lp ) with a single diagonal dither by 2.5 pixels to recover the under - sampled point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the fourth epoch was optimized for photometry of the host galaxy and , accordingly , we increased the exposure time to @xmath8  s.    we used `` on - the - fly '' pre - processing to produce debiased , flattened images .",
    "the images were then drizzled @xcite onto an image with pixels smaller than the original by a factor of 0.7 using a pixfrac of 0.8 .",
    "after rotation to a common orientation the images were registered to the first epoch images using the centroids of common objects in the field . the typical r.m.s .",
    "registration errors were less than 0.15 drizzled pixels .",
    "the host galaxy of grb  010921 has an integrated magnitude of @xmath9 mag or about 5@xmath10jy @xcite .",
    "consequently great care has to be taken to properly photometer the fading afterglow .",
    "below , we review various photometric techniques .",
    "* total magnitudes : * the simplest technique is to perform aperture photometry ( e.g. @xcite ) . the afterglow flux is obtained by subtracting the host flux estimated from a very late time measurement .",
    "a major concern is that the host flux is dependent upon the choice of aperture ( both center and size ) .",
    "thus , if different images have different seeing then it is possible to obtain an artificial bump in the light curve .",
    "* host subtraction : * the above concern can be alleviated by subtracting a late - time image from the earlier images .",
    "the afterglow may then be easily photometered in the host - subtracted images .",
    "this method has been used with considerable success by those observing sne  ia ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath11 subtraction : * in this technique , each image is subtracted from every other image and the afterglow residual photometered .",
    "the flux at each epoch can be fit through least - squares , assuming the flux at the final epoch is zero ( novicki and tonry , personal communication ) .",
    "this method makes use of the fact that the host galaxy has not been observed only once at late times , but at each epoch and thus better s / n can be obtained from the over - constrained system .",
    "we employed the @xmath11 subtraction technique to photometer the grb  010921 afterglow in our hst images .",
    "the images were subtracted using a modified version of isis @xcite and photometered using the analytic psf - fitting routine within vista ( j.  tonry , personal communication ) .",
    "we used the synphot package within iraf to calculate the response of the instrument and filter combination to a source with constant flux of 1  mjy ; the resulting values are ab magnitudes @xcite , expressed as fluxes .",
    "corrections were made for charge - transfer ( in)efficiency ( cte ) using the prescription of @xcite and aperture - corrected to infinity .",
    "we have also re - analyzed and photometered ground - based images @xcite of the afterglow , applying @xmath11 subtraction .",
    "since this technique assumes that the flux of the afterglow in the final epoch is zero , which may not be correct for these images , we subtracted the appropriate fourth - epoch hst observation ( which we have assumed contains no afterglow ) from the final ground - based images , measured the flux of the afterglow and added this value to the fluxes derived from the @xmath11 subtraction .",
    "the results of the photometry are host - subtracted fluxes for the afterglow in each of the images , under the assumption that the afterglow flux in the final hst image ( 2001 dec 21 ) is zero ( or negligible ) .",
    "these values are presented in tables  [ tab : hst ] and [ tab : ground ] .",
    "the values in table  [ tab : ground ] supersede the corresponding measurements presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we plot the afterglow light curves in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the light - curves are monotonically decreasing ( i.e. do not level off ) , and hence we deduce that our assumption of negligible flux in the final hst image is justified .",
    "temporal breaks in optical light - curves have been seen in many afterglows and are usually attributed to a `` jet '' geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a standard optical afterglow model , consisting of a broken power - law temporal decay with power - law indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and a power - law spectral index , @xmath14 @xcite .    each of these indices are functions of the electron energy distribution index , @xmath15 , dependent upon the location of the cooling break relative to the optical bands , and so we consider two cases : the cooling break is redward of the optical ( hereafter , case r ) ; and the cooling break is blueward of the optical ( case b ) .",
    "we consider , in addition to a constant circumburst medium , an inhomogeneous circumburst medium , @xmath16 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we apply the parametric extinction curves of @xcite and @xcite using the interpolation calculated by @xcite .",
    "these extinction curves are characterized by two values , the magnitude of the extinction in the rest - frame of the host galaxy , @xmath17 , and the slope of the uv extinction curve , @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath19 , corresponding to an lmc - like extinction curve . adopting other extinction curves ( e.g. mw , smc ) yields similar , but more - constraining results ( i.e. any underlying sn must be even fainter than the upper limit we derive below )",
    "; see @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the light curves contain an sn component . to this end",
    ", we use the observations of sn  1998bw for an sn template since it is one of the well observed bright ib / c sne which may be related to a grb @xcite .",
    "specifically , we used the @xmath20 photometry of @xcite and derived the flux distribution of sn  1998bw , using the zero - points and filter curves of @xcite . the resulting low resolution spectrum ( consisting of 5 points at the effective wavelength of each broadband filter ) , is redshifted to @xmath6 @xcite , assuming a flat lambda cosmology with @xmath21 and @xmath22 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 . the redshifted spectrum , which represents what sn  1998bw would look like at cosmological distances , is integrated with the appropriate filter curve to derive the apparent brightness at this redshift .",
    "sn  1998bw at @xmath6 would peak in the rest - frame @xmath24-band at approximately 4 @xmath25jy .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : lc ] that the afterglow is much fainter than this , and , further , that there is no clear bump in the afterglow light curve .",
    "we therefore allow the sn component to be scaled by @xmath26 magnitudes in our model .",
    "the sn is placed behind the same foreground ( i.e.  milky way ) and host galaxy extinction as the afterglow ( which can be inferred by demanding that the temporal and intrinsic spectral slopes , which both depend on the electron distribution index , @xmath15 , be consistent ; see e.g.  @xcite ) .    to calculate the sn detection limit of our observations",
    ", we fit the model by minimizing @xmath27 .",
    "the afterglow was not detected in any of the f450w images , and so we exclude them from our analysis .",
    "subtracting the host f450w image from our ground - based @xmath28 image left a large residual at the position of the host galaxy ( not of the ot ) .",
    "this poor subtraction is likely due to the filter mis - match , and so we do not include this point in our analysis .",
    "our analyses are summarized in table  [ tab : fit ] . in short ,",
    "we find no evidence for an underlying sn . in order to calculate the formal limits",
    ", we re - fit the data for a range of values of the sn brightness and computed the probability distribution from the resultant @xmath29 . as can be seen from table  [ tab : sn ] , the least constraining limit comes from the case where the afterglow evolves in a wind - stratified medium with the cooling break redward of the optical band , and even in this case , a sn brighter than @xmath30 mag is excluded at 99.7% confidence , and a sn as bright as sn  1998bw ( @xmath31 mag ) is ruled out at greater than 99.999% confidence .    the peak brightness and",
    "the time scales for sne ib / c are generally correlated such that fainter sne may peak earlier @xcite .",
    "it may be important to take this into account for our analysis , since the observations most sensitive to the presence of an underlying sn are all after the peak . to do this , we shifted the @xmath20 photometry of the ( intrinsically-)fainter type ic sn  1994i @xcite to @xmath0 , and derived the transformation between the redshifted sn  1998bw and 1994i light curves using a similar method as @xcite .",
    "this method is analogous to the `` stretch '' method for sne ia @xcite .",
    "if we use this transformation in our model to transform the redshifted sn  1998bw light curve to the light curve of a sn fainter than sn  1998bw by @xmath26 magnitudes , then our least - constraining limit on an underlying sn becomes @xmath32 mag fainter than sn  1998bw ( at 99.7% confidence ) .",
    "the agreement with the above limit indicates that the uncertainty in our knowledge of the the light - curve shape and luminosity scaling light - curve is not important for this analysis .",
    "leaving aside the sn issue , our fits provide a jet - break time of approximately 35 days . from the fregate 8  400 kev fluence of @xmath33 erg @xmath34",
    ", we calculate the @xmath35-corrected isotropic - equivalent energy release @xcite in the @xmath4-ray band , @xmath36 erg . applying the geometric correction from our measurement of the jet break ( using the formulation and normalization of @xcite ) ,",
    "we obtain a jet opening angle of @xmath37 .",
    "thus the true energy release is @xmath38 erg  consistent with the clustering of energy releases around @xmath39 erg @xcite .",
    "here we report the search for an underlying sn in the afterglow of grb  010921 .",
    "thanks to the superb photometric stability of hst and the @xmath11 subtraction technique , we have been able to trace the light curve of the afterglow of grb  010921 over two months .",
    "the resulting photometry is unbiased by aperture effects that are so prevalent in simple aperture and psf - fitting photometry .",
    "we report two results .",
    "first , we find a jet break time of 35 days , using only optical data .",
    "second , we find no evidence for an sn .",
    "a sn , if present , must be fainter than sn  1998bw by @xmath40 mag at 99.7% confidence . to our knowledge , to date , this is the most stringent limit for an underlying sn associated with a cosmologically located grb .    as noted in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , the collapsar model as currently understood has little power in predicting the dispersion in the amount of @xmath5ni synthesized as compared to the energy in relativistic ejecta .",
    "underlying sne are directly powered by the former whereas the grb is powered by the latter .",
    "observations are needed to start mapping the distribution in these critical explosion parameters .",
    "progress can be expected with such observational inputs accompanied by further refinements in the model .",
    "motivated thus , we summarize in table  [ tab : previous ] the status of sn searches for all table  [ tab : previous ] all known grbs with redshift less than 1.2 .",
    "the most secure case for an sn is that for grb  011121 @xcite .",
    "grb  980326 shows a strong red excess at about a month but unfortunately a redshift is lacking .",
    "grb  970228 shows a less clear excess but benefits from a known redshift",
    ". stated conservatively , a sn as bright as that of sn  1998bw can be ruled out in grb  000911 . in all cases",
    ", save that of grbs  980326 and 011121 , the presence of a host with a magnitude comparable to the brightness of the peak of the sn , makes it difficult to identify an sn component . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : subphot ] , `` bumps '' can arise from host contamination . combining hst and ground based measurements ( as is the case for grb  970228 ) is prone to considerable errors (  [ sec : subphot ] ) .    in summary , there is good evidence for an sn comparable in brightness to sn  1998bw in grb  011121 @xcite . for grb  010921 ,",
    "using the hst observations reported here , we constrain any putative underlying sn to be 1.34  mag fainter than sn  1998bw . in the collapsar framework",
    ", this absence could be most readily attributed to the well known dispersion of the peak luminosity of type ib / c sne .",
    "an alternative possibility is that there may be more than one type of progenitor for long duration grbs . along these lines",
    "we note that @xcite claim that some afterglows ( e.g. grb  990123 ) are incompatible with a @xmath16 inhomogeneous circumburst distribution whereas other afterglows ( e.g. grbs  970228 and 970508 ) are better explained by invoking an inhomogeneous circumburst medium .",
    "progress requires both searches for underlying sne as well as characterizing the circumburst medium via modeling of the early - time afterglow ( e.g. grb  011121 , see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the afterglow of grb  010921 ( and any coincident sn ) was extincted by @xmath41 mag of dust in the foreground , and @xmath42 mag of dust in the host galaxy ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "thus , in the future , using acs aboard hst it should be possible to extend sn searches to at least 3 mag fainter than sn  1998bw , at which point it will be possible to detect more typical sne ib / c coincident with grbs .",
    "we thank pete challis for helpful discussions about wfpc2 reduction , and megan novicki and john tonry for an advance copy of their @xmath11 subtraction paper .",
    "srk and sgd thank nsf for supporting our ground - based grb observing program .",
    "bps and pap thank the arc for supporting australian grb research .",
