    "the postfilter is realized as a wiener filter , where an estimate of the ratio between direct and diffuse signal components at the output of the baseline beamformer are used as an approximation of the short - time to compute the time- and frequency - dependent postfilter gains .",
    "the employed postfilter is -independent and has a low computational complexity .",

    "the beamformer output @xmath20 is obtained by multiplying each microphone signal with a complex - valued filter weight @xmath21 , followed by a summation over all microphone channels : @xmath22 where @xmath23^{t }      \\label{eq : bfweights_vector}\\ ] ] contains the beamformer filter coefficients @xmath21 .",

    ", the employed estimator does not require the of the speech source , since @xmath51 is not required for calculating @xmath50 . in @xcite it was shown that the employed estimator ( [ eq : cdr_estimator ] ) is unbiased and robust in the sense that deviations of the coherence estimate @xmath52 from the assumed model do not lead to large deviations of the estimate . a more detailed investigation of the employed estimator ( [ eq : cdr_estimator ] ) and a comparison to different estimators with respect to bias , robustness , and dereverberation performance ,",

    "when applying the coherence - based postfilter to the output of a beamformer , two aspects need to be considered : first , since the microphone array of the challenge consists of five forward - facing microphones , the estimator ( initially designed for a pair of microphones ) has to be adapted to exploit all available microphone signals . to do so",
