    "the @xmath11 reaction is one of the critical links in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 branches of the @xmath14chain of solar hydrogen burning [ 13 ] .",
    "the total capture rate determined by processes of this chain is sensitive to the cross section @xmath15 ( or the astrophysical @xmath0 factor @xmath6 ) for the @xmath16 reaction and predicted neutrino rate varies as @xmath17^{0.8}$ ] @xcite .    despite the impressive improvements in our understanding of the @xmath11 reaction made in the past decades ( see refs [ 411 ] and references therein ) , however",
    ", some ambiguities connected with both the extrapolation of the measured cross sections for the aforesaid reaction to the solar energy region and the theoretical predictions for @xmath15 ( or @xmath6 ) still exist and they may influence the predictions of the standard solar model @xcite",
    ".    experimentally , there are two types of data for the @xmath16 reaction at extremely low energies : i ) six measurements based on detecting of @xmath18-rays capture ( see @xcite and references therein ) from which the astrophysical @xmath0 factor @xmath19 extracted by the authors of those works changes within the range 0.47@xmath200.58 @xmath21 and ii ) six measurements based on detecting of @xmath12 ( see @xcite references therein as well as [ 6 - 11 ] ) from which @xmath19 extracted by the authors of these works changes within the range 0.53@xmath220.63 @xmath23 . all of these measured data have a similar energy dependence for the astrophysical @xmath0 factors @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , the adaptation of the available energy dependencies predicted in @xcite for the extrapolation of each of the measured data to low experimentally inaccessible energy regions , including @xmath8=0 , leads to a value of @xmath19 that differs from others and this difference exceeds the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the theoretical calculations of @xmath19 performed within different methods also show considerable spread [ 12,1419 ] and the result depends on a specific model used .",
    "for example , the resonating - group method calculations of @xmath19 performed in ref.@xcite show considerable sensitivity to the form of the effective nn interaction used and the estimates have been obtained within the range of 0.312@xmath20 0.841 @xmath23 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath19=0.52@xmath24 0.03 @xmath25 @xcite also should be noted .",
    "the latter has been obtained from the analysis of the experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors @xcite , which were performed within the framework of the standard two - body potential model in the assumption that the dominant contribution to the peripheral reaction comes from the surface and external regions of the nucleus @xmath12 @xcite . at this , in @xcite the contribution from the nuclear interior ( @xmath26 , @xmath27=4 fm ) to the amplitude is ignored . in this case , the astrophysical @xmath0 factor is directly expressed in terms of the nuclear vertex constants ( nvc ) for the virtual decays @xmath28 ( or respective the asymptotic normalization coefficients ( anc ) for @xmath29 ) @xcite . as a result , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nvc - values for the virtual decays @xmath30 and @xmath31 were obtained , which were then used for calculations of the astrophysical @xmath0 factors at @xmath32180 kev , including @xmath8=0 .",
    "however , the values of the ancs ( or nvcs ) @xmath33 and the @xmath19 obtained in @xcite may not be enough accurate associated both with the aforesaid assumption in respect to the contribution from the nuclear interior ( @xmath26 ) and with a presence of the spread in the experimental data @xcite used for the analysis . as far available values of these ancs obtained in @xcite",
    ", they depend noticeably on a specific model used .",
    "therefore , determination of precise experimental values of the ancs for @xmath33(g.s . ) and @xmath29(0.429 mev ) is highly desirable since it has direct effects in the correct extrapolation of the @xmath34 astrophysical @xmath0 factor at solar energies .",
    "recently , a modified two - body potential approach ( mtbpa ) was proposed in @xcite for the peripheral direct capture @xmath35 reaction , which is based on the idea proposed in paper @xcite that low - energy direct radiative captures of particle @xmath36 by light nuclei @xmath37 proceed mainly in regions well outside the range of the internuclear @xmath38 interactions .",
    "one notes that in mtbpa the direct astrophysical @xmath0 factor is expressed in terms of anc for @xmath39 rather than through the spectroscopic factor for the nucleus @xmath40 in the ( @xmath41 ) configuration as it is made within the standard two - body potential method @xcite . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "mtbpa has been successfully applied to the radiative proton and @xmath9-particle capture by some light nuclei .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to apply the mtbpa for analysis of the @xmath42 reaction .    in this work new analysis of the modern precise experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors for the direct capture @xmath16 reaction at extremely low energies ( @xmath43 90 kev )",

    "we quantitatively show that the @xmath45 reaction within the aforesaid energy region is mainly peripheral and one can extract ancs for @xmath46 directly from the @xmath47 reaction where the ambiguities inherent for the standard two -body potential model calculation of the @xmath48 reaction , which is connected with the choice of the geometric parameters ( the radius @xmath49 and the diffuseness @xmath36 ) for the woods ",

    "whereas , in @xcite the experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors have been separated for all experimental points of @xmath8 from the aforesaid energy region by means of detecting the prompt @xmath18 ray ( the prompt method ) and by counting the @xmath60 activity ( the activation ) .    the woods ",

    "[ 3032 ] is used here for the calculations of both bound state radial wave function @xmath70 and scattering wave function @xmath71 .",
    "such the choice is based on the following considerations .",
    "firstly , this potential form is justified from the microscopic point of view because it makes it possible to take into account the pauli principle between nucleons in @xmath52- and @xmath9-clusters in the ( @xmath72 ) bound state by means of inclusion of deeply bound states forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the latter imitates the additional node ( @xmath73 ) arising in the wave functions of @xmath74 relative motion in @xmath12 similarly as the result of the microscopic resonating - group method @xcite .",
    "secondly , this potential describes well the phase shifts for @xmath75-scattering in the wide energy range @xcite and reproduces the energies of low - lying states of the @xmath76 nucleus @xcite .",
    "we vary the geometric parameters ( radius @xmath49 and diffuseness @xmath36 ) of the adopted woods ",
    "saxon potential in the physically acceptable ranges ( @xmath49 in 1.621.98 fm and @xmath36 in 0.630.77 fm @xcite ) in respect to the standard values ( @xmath49=1.80 fm and @xmath36=0.70 fm @xcite ) using the procedure of the depth adjusted to fit the binding energies . as",
    "an illustration , fig.[fig1 ] shows plots of the @xmath77 dependence on the single - particle anc , @xmath78 for @xmath50= 1 and @xmath51=3/2 and 1/2 only for the two values of energy @xmath8 .",
    "the width of the band for these curves is the result of the weak @xmath3residual@xmath79-dependence of the @xmath80 on the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath36 ( up to @xmath81 ) for the @xmath82 @xcite . the same dependence is also observed at other energies .",
    "for example , for fig.1 plotted for @xmath8=0.1056 ( 0.1477 ) mev overall uncertainty ( @xmath83 ) of the function @xmath80 in respect to the central values @xmath77 corresponding to the central values of @xmath84 comes to @xmath83=@xmath24 4.5(@xmath244.5)% for the ground state of @xmath12 and @xmath83 = @xmath24 3.4(@xmath242.9)% for the excited state of @xmath12 . as it is seen from here that the @xmath11(0.429 mev ) reaction is slightly more peripheral than the @xmath16(g.s . )",
    "reaction since the binging energy for @xmath12(0.429 mev ) is less than that for @xmath85(g.s ) .",
    "the similar dependence of @xmath80 on the @xmath78 values is observed for the other aforesaid energies @xmath8 and the value of @xmath83 is no more than @xmath86 5.0% .",
    "it follows from here that the condition ( a2 ) is satisfied for the considered reaction at the energies above mentioned within the uncertainties not exceeding the experimental errors of @xmath66 .",
    "it should be noted that values of @xmath83 becomes larger as the energy @xmath8 increases ( for @xmath8 more than 1.3 mev ) .",
    "thus , over the energy region 92.9@xmath7e@xmath7 1200 kev the @xmath87-dependence on @xmath88 is exactly sufficiently weak being within the experimental uncertainties for the @xmath66 .",
    "such dependence is apparently associated also with the indirect taking into account the pauli principle mentioned above within the nuclear interior in the adopted nuclear @xmath89 potential leading as a whole to reduction of the contribution from the interior part of the radial matrix element into the @xmath87 function , which is typical for peripheral reactions .",
    "we also calculated the @xmath90-elastic scattering phase shifts by variation of the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath36 in the same range for the adopted woods ",
    "saxon potential . as an illustration ,",
    "the results of the calculations corresponding to the @xmath91 and @xmath92 waves are only presented in fig.[fig2 ] in which the width of the bands corresponds to a change of phase shifts values with respect to variation of values of the @xmath49 and @xmath36 parameters . as it is seen from fig.[fig2 ] ,",
    "the experimental phase shifts @xcite are well reproduced within uncertainty of about @xmath24 5% .",
    "the same results are also obtained for the @xmath93 and @xmath94 waves .",
    "this circumstance allows us to test the condition ( a3 ) at the energies of @xmath8= 92.9 , 105.6 and 147.7 kev for which the @xmath16(g.s . ) and @xmath16(0.429 mev ) astrophysical @xmath0 factors were separately measured in @xcite . as an illustration , for the same energies @xmath8 as in fig.[fig1 ] we present in fig.[fig3 ] ( the upper panels ) the results of @xmath95-value calculation given by eq.(a3 ) ( @xmath96=(1@xmath97 3/2 ) and ( 1@xmath97 1/2 ) ) in which instead of the @xmath98 the experimental @xmath0 factors for the @xmath99 reaction populating to the ground and first excited states of @xmath12 were taken .",
    "it should be noted that the same dependence occurs for other considered energies .",
    "the calculation shows the obtained @xmath95 values also weakly ( up to 5.0 % ) depend on the @xmath78-value .",
    "consequently , the @xmath11 reaction within the considered energy ranges is peripheral and a use of parametrization in terms of the ancs given by eq.(a1 ) is adequate to the physics of the reaction under consideration .",
    "however , the values of the spectroscopic factors @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponding to the @xmath102-configuration for @xmath12(g.s . ) and @xmath85(0.429 kev ) , respectively , change strongly about 1.7 times since calculated @xmath103 that vary by 1.75 times ( see , the lower panels in fig.[fig3 ] ) .    for each energy",

    "this fact allows us to conclude that the energy dependence of the experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors [ 611 ] is well determined by the calculated function @xmath80 and @xmath127 .",
    "hence , the experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors presented in [ 611 ] can be used as an independent source of reliable information about the ancs for @xmath121(g.s . ) and @xmath128(0.429 mev ) . also , in fig.[fig5 ] and table [ table2 ] the weighted means of the ancs - values and their uncertainties ( the solid line and the band width , respectively ) , derived both separately from each experimental data and from all of the experimental points , are presented .    as it is seen also from the first and second ( fifth and sixth ) lines of table [ table2 ] the weighted means of the ancs - values for @xmath121(g.s . ) and @xmath128(0.429 mev ) obtained by the analysis performed separately for the activation , the prompt method and the @xmath60 recoils of the experimental data from the works [ 69 ] ( @xcite ) are in a good agreement with one another .",
    "these results are the first ones of the present work .",
    "nevertheless , the weighted means @xcite of the anc - values obtained by using separately the experimental data of the works refs.[69 ] and of the works refs.@xcite noticeably differ from one another ( up to 1.13 times for @xmath129(g.s . ) and up to 1.12 times for @xmath122(0.429 mev ) , see the parenthetical figures in table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the main reason of this difference is in the systematical discrepancy observed in absolute values of the experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors measured by authors of works refs [ 69](the set i ) and of the works ref .",
    "@xcite ( the set ii , see fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "also , the central values of the weighted means for the anc - values for @xmath130(g.s . ) and @xmath131(0.429 mev ) obtained from all of the experimental data [ 611 ] , which is presented in the last line of table [ table2 ] , differ up to 10% more ( 3% less ) than those deduced from the data of [ 69](@xcite ) . as , at present , there is no a reasonable argument to prosecute to some of these experimental data measured by two groups ( [ 6 - 9](the set i ) and @xcite(the set ii ) ) , it seems , it is reasonable to obtain the weighted means of the ancs derived from all these real experimental ancs with upper and lower limits corresponding to the experimental data of the set ii and set i , respectively .",
    "this leads to the asymmetric uncertainty for the weighted means of ancs and this is caused with the aforesaid systematical discrepancy observed in absolute values of the experimental data of the sets i and ii ( see the last line of table [ table2 ] ) . in this connection , from our point of view a new precisely measurement of @xmath132 is highly encouraged since it allows one to get an additional information about the ancs .",

    "a comparison of the present result and that obtained in paper @xcite shows that the underestimation of the contribution both of the nuclear interior and of the nuclear exterior indeed occurs in @xcite since the contribution of the nuclear interior ( @xmath133 4.0 fm ) to the calculated astrophysical @xmath0 factors and use the experimental data [ 6 - 11 ] more accurate than those in ref.@xcite can influence the extracted values of the ancs . besides",

    "we tested again the fulfilment of the condition ( a2 ) in the same way as it is done above for e@xmath221 90 kev and similar results plotted in fig.[fig1 ] are also observed at energies of e@xmath222 kev .    the experimental and calculated astrophysical @xmath0 factors for the @xmath11(g.s . ) , @xmath16 ( 0.429 mev ) and @xmath16 ( g.s.+0.429 mev ) reactions are presented in table [ table1 ] and displayed in fig.[fig6]_a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ , respectively . in figs.[fig6]_a _ and _ b _ , the open diamond and triangle symbols ( the filled triangle symbols ) show our results for the @xmath11(g.s . ) and @xmath16(0.429 mev ) reactions ( see table [ table1 ] also ) , which are obtained from the analysis of the total experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors of [ 79 ] and @xcite(@xcite ) , respectively , by using the corresponding values of the ancs for each energy @xmath8 experimental point presented figs.[fig5]_a _ and _ b _ ( see table [ table1 ] too ) . there the open circle symbols lying along the smooth solid lines are the results of the extrapolation obtained by us in which each of the quoted uncertainties is the uncertainty associated with that for the ancs adopted .",

    "but , these weighted means of @xmath19 obtained by us from the independent analysis of the different data ( the set i and the set ii ) differ also noticeably from one another ( about 11% ) and this distinction is mainly associated with the aforesaid difference observed in magnitudes of the corresponding ancs presented in the third and seventh lines of table [ table2 ] .",

    "but , it is interesting to note that the central value of it is closer to that given in the third line of table [ table2 ] , than to the central value of the weighted mean given in the seventh line of table [ table2 ] . also , the astrophysical @xmath0 factors , calculated by using the values of the ancs obtained separately from the set i , the set ii and both them ( see table [ table2 ] ) , are fitted independently using a second - order polynomial within three energy intervals ( 0@xmath227 500 kev , 0@xmath227 1000 kev and 0@xmath227 1200 kev ) .",

    "one notes that they also are in agreement with -0.73 mev@xmath229 @xcite and -0.92@xmath240.18 mev@xmath229 @xcite .",
    "it is seen from here that the @xmath6 calculated by us ( the solid lines in fig.[fig6]_a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ ) and that obtained in @xcite have practically the same energy dependence within the aforesaid energy interval but they differ mainly with each other by a normalization .",
    "our result for @xmath19 differs noticeably on that recommended in refs.@xcite @xcite and @xcite(@xmath230 40 kevb , 0.52@xmath240.03 kevb and 0.51@xmath240.04 kev b , respectively ) .",
    "this circumstance is apparently connected with the underestimation of the contribution from the external part in the amplitude admitted in these works .",
    "besides , the result of the present work is noticeably larger than the result of @xmath19=0.516 ( 0.53 ) kev b @xcite(@xcite ) obtained within the standard two - body ( @xmath147 ) potential by using @xmath89 potential deduced by a double - folding procedure .",
    "one of the possible reason of this discrepancy can be apparently associated with the assumption admitted in @xcite that a value of the ratio @xmath174 for the bound mirror ( @xmath231)-pair is taken equal to unity ( @xmath232 = @xmath233=1.17 @xcite ) , which in turn results in the observed systematical underestimation of the calculated @xmath6 in respect to the experimental @xmath0 factors ( see the dashed line in fig.[fig6]_c _ ) .",
    "but , as shown in subsection 2.3 the values of @xmath174 for the ground and first excited states of the mirror ( @xmath234)-pair are large unity . therefore , the underestimated values of @xmath232 and @xmath233 used in @xcite also result in the underestimated value of @xmath19 for the direct capture @xmath235 reaction .",
    "perhaps , the assumption about equal values of the spectroscopic factor ( @xmath236 = @xmath237=1.17 @xcite ) is correct only for the spectroscopic factors @xmath238 since the value of @xmath19 obtained in @xcite and @xcite for the direct capture @xmath239 reaction agree excellently with each other .",
    "one notes that in ref.@xcite the analysis of the @xmath239 experimental astrophysical @xmath0 factors @xcite has also been performed within mtbpa and the anc for @xmath208(g.s . ) , which has been deduced there from the results of ref.@xcite , also is in good agreement with that recommended by authors of ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that the value of @xmath19= 0.56 @xmath226 @xcite obtained within the microscopical ( @xmath147)-cluster approach is in agreement with our result within the uncertainty .",
    "besides , our result is also in excellent agreement with that of @xmath19= 0.609 @xmath226 @xcite and @xmath19= 0.621 @xmath240 @xcite obtained within the ( @xmath241)-channel of version of the resonating - group method by using the modified wildermuth - tang ( mwt ) and the near - serber exchange mixture forms for the effective nn potential , respectively .",
    "it follows from here that the mutual agreement between the results obtained in the present work and works of @xcite , which is based on the common approximation about the cluster @xmath242 structure of the @xmath60 , allows one to draw a conclusion about the dominant contribution of the @xmath242 clusterization to the low - energy @xmath56 cross section both in the absolute normalization and in the energy dependence [ 611 ] .",
    "therefore , single - channel @xmath243 approximation for @xmath60 @xcite is quite appropriate for this reaction in the considered energy range .    also , it is interesting to note that the ratios of the @xmath3indirectly determined astrophysical @xmath0 factors , @xmath244(0 ) and @xmath245 , for the @xmath246 reaction populating to the ground and first excited states obtained in the present work to those for the mirror @xmath247 reaction populating to the ground and first excited states deduced in ref.@xcite are equal to @xmath248=6.87@xmath249 and @xmath250=6.11@xmath251 , respectively .",
    "these values are in a good agreement with those of @xmath248=6.6 and @xmath250=5.9 deduced in ref.@xcite within the microscopic cluster model .",
    "this result also confirms directly our estimation for the ratio @xmath252 obtained above since the ancs for @xmath253(g.s ) and @xmath253(0.478 mev ) as well as the ancs for @xmath65(g.s ) and @xmath33(0.429 mev ) determine the astrophysical @xmath0 factors for the @xmath254 and @xmath219 reactions at zero energies and , consequently , the ratios @xmath248 and @xmath250 are proportional to @xmath255 and @xmath172 , respectively .    fig .",
    "[ fig6]_d _ shows a comparison between the branching ratio @xmath113 obtained in the present work ( the open triangle and square symbols ) and that recommended in refs.@xcite ( the filled square symbols ) , in @xcite ( the filled circle symbols ) and @xcite ( the filled triangle symbols ) .",

    "the present result for @xmath256 is in an excellent agreement with those of 0.43@xmath24 0.02 @xcite and 0.43 @xcite but is noticeably larger than 0.37 @xcite and 0.32@xmath24 0.01 @xcite .",
