    "note that @xmath21 for sneutrinos and @xmath22 for charged sleptons .",
    "in particular , for the charged sleptons each @xmath23 is a 6@xmath243 matrix defined as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , ( @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 is a 6@xmath246 mixing matrix for charged sleptons of all three generations . for 3 sneutrinos , @xmath29 directly diagonalizes the 3@xmath243 sneutrino mass matrix .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the chargino , neutralino , sneutrino and charged slepton mass eigenvalues , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the muon mass and diagonal muon yukawa coupling , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the electroweak gauge couplings",

    "in fact , any combination of chiral muon states contributes to @xmath46 with the net contribution _ suppressed _ by small yukawa coupling @xmath35 , as one can see , for instance , from the relevant feynman diagrams in terms of flavor eigenstates ( _ i.e. _ , in the interaction basis ) . that also explains why the electron anomalous magnetic moment is less sensitive to new physics than its muon analogy . ]",
    "the enhancement by tan@xmath47 can be traced back to the diagrams with the chirality flip inside the loop ( or in one of the vertices ) as opposed to the terms proportional to @xmath48 and @xmath49 where the chirality flip takes place in the external muon leg .",
    "there are no similarly enhanced terms in the sm , where the chirality can only be flipped in the external muon leg .",
    "thus for tan@xmath50 we expect that the terms proportional to @xmath38 and @xmath39 dominate in eqs.([eq : dac ] ) and ( [ eq : dan ] ) , and that compared to the sm electroweak gauge boson contribution @xmath51 , the susy contribution scales approximately as a_^susy a_^ew ( ) ^2 15 10 ^ -10 ( ) ^2 , [ eq : compew ] where @xmath52 stands for the heaviest sparticle mass in the loop .",

    "we present our results in terms of the contour lines of constant @xmath2 drawn in the susy parameter space . in section 2",
    ", we review our numerical analysis .",
    "sections 3 and 4 discuss the results and prospects for the future .",
    "our numerical analysis has relied on the top down global analysis introduced in @xcite .",
    "the soft susy breaking mediated by supergravity ( sugra)@xcite was assumed throughout this paper . as explained at the end of the previous section , the magnitude of tan@xmath47 is of special interest for the analysis .",
    "hence we discuss separately three cases with low , medium , and large value of tan@xmath47 .",
    "first , fixed tan@xmath54 was considered , along with the scalar trilinear parameter @xmath56 set to zero to simplify the analysis which is insensitive to @xmath56 in this case .",
    "next , tan@xmath47 was raised to @xmath57 and @xmath56 set free to vary . in the third case",
    ", we used the results of the global analysis of model 4c , a simple so(10 ) model with minimal number of effective operators leading to realistic yukawa matrices .",
    "the model was suggested by lucas and raby @xcite and its low - energy analysis was presented in @xcite .",
    "a direct model dependence of @xmath1 on the details of the yukawa matrices is , however , very limited . in this case",
    ", tan@xmath47 was not fixed to any particular value .",
    "instead , it was a free parameter of the global analysis but since the model predicted exact @xmath58 yukawa coupling unification , the best fit values of tan@xmath47 were always found between 50 and 55 , dependent on a particular @xmath59 point as explained below .",
    "@xmath56 was free to vary  as for tan@xmath55  which allowed the best fits to optimize the effects of the left - right stop mixing , which is enhanced by tan@xmath47 , in the analysis .",
    "in each of the three cases , gauge coupling unification was imposed up to a small ( less than 5% ) negative correction , called @xmath60 , to @xmath61 at the unification scale @xmath62 .",
    "scale @xmath62 has been defined as the scale where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are exactly equal to the common value @xmath65 . for low and medium tan@xmath47 ( @xmath66 and @xmath57 ) ,",
    "the minimal set of the initial susy parameters m_1/2 , m_0 , a_0 , , [ 4params ] was assumed , with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath56 ( the universal gaugino mass , scalar mass and trilinear coupling ) introduced at @xmath62 .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the third generation fermions at @xmath62 were unconstrained and free to vary independently on each other . for large tan@xmath47 in the third case ,",
    "the scalar higgs masses were allowed to deviate from @xmath68 in order to alleviate strong fine - tuning required for the correct electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus instead of ( [ 4params ] ) , the set m_1/2 , m_0 , ( m_h_d / m_0)^2 , ( m_h_u / m_0)^2 , a_0 , , [ 6params ] was actually used as initial susy parameters .",
    "as already mentioned , the third generation yukawas were strictly set equal to each other at @xmath62 in this case .",
    "in fact , the so(10)-based equality among them is the main reason why such a large tan@xmath47 is attractive .",
    "the rest of the analysis was then the same for each of the three cases .",
    "particular values of @xmath68 and @xmath67 were picked up , while the rest of the initial parameters varied . that included varying @xmath65 , @xmath62 , @xmath60 , the third generation yukawa couplings , and @xmath56 ( for medium and large tan@xmath47 ) . using the 2-loop rges for the dimensionless couplings and 1-loop rges for the dimensionful couplings",
    "the theory was renormalized down to the susy scale , which was set equal to the mass of the @xmath28 boson .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking was checked to one loop as in @xcite , based on the effective potential method of ref.@xcite .",
    "one - loop susy threshold corrections to fermion masses were calculated consistently at this scale .",
    "that is of particular importance for @xmath3 which receives significant corrections if tan@xmath47 is large .",
    "also , the experimental constraints imposed by the observed branching ratio @xmath69 and by direct sparticle searches were taken into account .",
    "finally , @xmath70 was evaluated following eqs.([eq : dac ] ) and ( [ eq : dan ] ) for those values of the initial parameters which gave the lowest @xmath71 calculated out of the ten low energy observables @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath69",
    ". details of the low energy analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath81 did not have any effect on the @xmath71 calculation and the subsequent selection of the susy parameter space .",
    "the results for tan@xmath54 and tan@xmath55 are shown in figures [ famu_tb2_susy][famu_tb20_mm ] .",
    "the figures [ famu_tb2_susy ] and [ famu_tb20_susy ] show the contour lines of constant @xmath82 in the @xmath59 plane .",
    "these results are then transformed into the dependence on physical masses in figures [ famu_tb2_mm ] and [ famu_tb20_mm ] , where we chose the @xmath83 plane , with @xmath84 being the muon sneutrino mass and @xmath85 being the mass of the lighter chargino .",
    "the contour lines in these figures are bound from below by the limit on the neutralino mass ( a limit @xmath86gev was imposed flatly , for simplicity ) , and from above by the stau mass ( @xmath87gev , in this analysis ) .",
    "the important observation is that the present limits on @xmath81 , eq.([da_now ] ) are not excluding any region of the parameter space which is left available by other experiments .",
    "the size of @xmath46 is in agreement with the results of chattopadhyay and nath , and of moroi @xcite .",
    "we can also confirm their observation that the neutralino contribution @xmath88 is generally much smaller than the chargino contribution @xmath89 in the whole parameter space available . yet",
    "several interesting characteristics of the presented results can not be read off directly from the earlier studies .",
    "it is first of all the simple pattern suggested by figures [ famu_tb2_mm ] and [ famu_tb20_mm ] .",
    "the pattern in the figures shows a strong dependence of @xmath81 on the sneutrino mass and very little sensitivity to the mass of the lighter chargino .",
    "that can be understood from the fact that the loop integrals are in general most sensitive to the heaviest mass in the loop , and the universal initial conditions ( see ( [ 4params ] ) ) together with the experimental limits from direct searches always lead to @xmath90 at the electroweak scale .",
    "actually , the figures show how well the approximate relation ( [ eq : compew ] ) works .",
    "one could _",
    "e.g. _ , directly read out the value of sneutrino mass from a figure of this type once a more accurate measurement of @xmath1 and the value of tan@xmath47 become available . alternatively , a more accurate measurement of @xmath1 can be converted into a limit on tan@xmath47 in a straightforward way , if the sneutrino mass is known .",
    "also note how well the linear dependence @xmath91 holds",
    ". if we overlapped figures [ famu_tb2_mm ] and [ famu_tb20_mm ] , the contour lines marked as 10 , 5 , 2 , 1 , and 0.5 in figure [ famu_tb2_mm ] would be practically on top of the contour lines marked as 100 , 50 , 20 , 10 , and 5 in figure [ famu_tb20_mm ] .",
    "that suggests that the tan@xmath47 enhanced terms in eqs.([eq : dac ] ) and ( [ eq : dan ] ) become dominant already for tan@xmath92 .",
    "we checked this feature in the numerical analysis : typically , the term proportional to @xmath38 in eq.([eq : dac ] ) accounts for about 8085% of the net @xmath93 for tan@xmath54 , while it is 97 - 99% for tan@xmath55 .",
    "( the analogous term in eq.([eq : dan ] ) is less dominant , but has a smaller net effect since @xmath94 . )    from these results one could extrapolate that the current @xmath1 limit , eq.([da_now ] ) , places an important constraint on the analysis if tan@xmath47 is as large as 50 .",
    "however , case tan@xmath0 is qualitatively different . as discussed in the study by blaek and raby @xcite , the global analysis yields two distinct fits , figs .",
    "[ f_f4c110]a  b .",
    "the fits differ by the sign of the wilson coefficient @xmath95 in the effective quark hamiltonian below the electroweak scale .",
    "( the coefficient @xmath96 determines the @xmath97 decay amplitude , after the qcd renormalization effects are taken into account @xcite . ) in the mssm with large tan@xmath47 , the sign of @xmath96 can be the same , or the opposite , as in the sm .",
    "it can be reversed due to the fact that the chargino contribution can be of either sign .",
    "this contribution is enhanced by tan@xmath47 compared to the sm and charged higgs contributions , whose signs are fixed and alike , and thus the flipped sign of @xmath95 can not be obtained for low tan@xmath47 . for tan@xmath0",
    "the fit with the flipped sign is equally good as the fit with the sign unchanged , see figure [ f_f4c110 ] .",
    "the fits differ in the range of the allowed susy parameter space : to reverse the sign the chargino contribution accepts lower squark masses and different values of @xmath56 than in the case when the sign is unchanged .",
    "one can anticipate that these differences will be reflected in the analysis of @xmath98 with tan@xmath0 , since the quark sector is correlated with the lepton sector through the unification constraint , and the soft masses are interrelated through the universality assumption . due to differences in susy spectra",
    "we can expect @xmath98 to be more significant in the fit with the flipped sign of @xmath95 than in the fit where the signs are the same .",
    "these expectations are indeed realized in our results in figs .",
    "[ famu_f4c]a and [ famu_f4c]b . in these figures",
    ", we plot the contour lines in the ( @xmath99 ) plane of @xmath98 , calculated according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dac ] ) and ( [ eq : dan ] ) , with all the masses , mixings and couplings taken over from the best fit values at the specific ( @xmath99 ) point in the susy space .",
    "plane in this case . for large tan@xmath47",
    "the best fits of the global analysis result in the lightest chargino being higgsino - like , with its mass close to the electroweak scale across the whole @xmath100 plane . thus the two - dimensional plots in the @xmath83 plane would contract to a dependence on @xmath84 only . ]",
    "the important feature , which runs contrary to the naive extrapolation from the previous two cases , is that the mssm contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment _ stays within the currently allowed range at @xmath101 , even for tan@xmath47 as large as predicted by simple so(10 ) guts_. despite the fact that figures [ famu_tb2_susy]-[famu_tb20_mm ] suggest that the analysis with tan@xmath102 becomes sensitive to the current constraint on @xmath1 , eq.([da_now ] ) , our results in fig.[famu_f4c ] clearly indicate that this is not the case .",
    "the reson for this is that we consistently demand that all known particle physics constraints ( besides those imposed by @xmath1 ) are accounted for . for tan@xmath47 as large as 50 ,",
    "the allowed susy parameter range is further reduced by strong constraints on the @xmath103 quark mass and the branching ratio @xmath69 , when compared to the regime where tan@xmath54 or @xmath57 .    finally , we make a note on the sign of @xmath104 .",
    "as clearly indicated on the top of each figure , we have presented our results just for @xmath105 . for this sign of the @xmath104 parameter , the susy contributions to @xmath1 are positive across the whole ( @xmath99 ) plane . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the contributions change sign too .",
    "however , the chargino contribution to @xmath96 also changes sign in this case , which leads to unacceptable values of @xmath69 for medium and large tan@xmath47 .",
    "it is amazing to observe that for this range of tan@xmath47 the sign of the @xmath104 parameter favored by @xmath97 is the same as the sign preferred by the experimental window open for @xmath107 .",
    ", the @xmath97 constraint disappears ( the chargino contribution to @xmath96 is small ) and @xmath104 can be negative .",
    "however , figure [ famu_tb2_susy ] shows that @xmath98 is very small in this case .",
    "we know from the earlier studies @xcite that no substantial change in the magnitude of @xmath98 occurs for different signs of @xmath104 .",
    "thus we conclude that for @xmath106 only the low tan@xmath47 case is viable , but then the susy contributions to @xmath1 stay below the electroweak contributions and will be hard to observe even after the e821 experiment is completed . ]",
    "when the future bnl experiment reduces the uncertainty on @xmath1 down to @xmath108 at 90%c.l . , eq.([da_99 ] ) , the muon anomalous magnetic moment will undoubtfully turn into a powerful constraint on the mssm analysis .",
    "it is already clear from figures [ famu_tb2_susy ] , [ famu_tb20_susy ] , and [ famu_f4c ] that it will be a major constraint for large and medium tan@xmath47 in the region @xmath109gev . of course",
    ", the bnl result may drastically affect the mssm analysis with any value of tan@xmath47 if the observed central value turns out to be below ( or well above ) the sm prediction .",
    "for such an outcome , the muon anomalous magnetic moment will actually become a dominant constraint for the mssm analysis with the universal sugra - mediated susy breaking terms .",
