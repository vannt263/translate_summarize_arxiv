    "not all the required lattice calculations have been done , but so far , the lattice evidence is against @xmath15 .",
    "as the lattice spacing is reduced , while keeping hadronic physics fixed , the lattice bare couplings evolve according to their anomalous dimensions . in the quenched approximation ,",
    "these anomalous dimensions are slightly wrong , due to the absence of light quark loops .",
    "the strong coupling constant evolves according to the zero - quark @xmath60 function coefficient @xmath61 rather than the correct three - quark coefficient @xmath62 .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath63 in the quenched approximation is expected to be too small by a factor of about 9/11 .",
    "since the short - distance quark mass evolution is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , this implies that the quark mass evolves too slowly in the quenched approximation , and at small lattice spacings is larger than in real life . at high energies , running mass evolution",
    "is given by @xmath66 to leading log accuracy , therefore , the effect of the absence of quark loops due to _ perturbative _ effects on the evolution of the running mass from the strong coupling region ( where @xmath67 ) to the high energy region can be approximated by @xcite @xmath68 for @xmath69 to 1/8 .",
    "there are also quenching effects arising from the nonperturbative region . unlike the case of quarkonium systems , for pions there is no argument that these should be smaller than the perturbative effects .",

    "they differ by as much as a factor of two from quenched results , and do not seem to reproduce the lattice spacing dependence of the quenched results as would have been expected ( see ref .",

    "the unquenched results indeed lie below the quenched results by roughly the expected amount , and i will use them to estimate the effects of quenching .",
    "the large corrections in staggered fermion mass renormalization cancel out in the ratio of the quenched and unquenched determinations , making this an useful quantity to examine . to minimize effects due to differences in analysis methods",
    ", we estimate the ratio from the results of a single group , at similar volumes and lattice spacings ( about 0.4 gev@xmath70 ) @xcite , and obtain @xmath71 since there are , in fact , three flavors of light quarks in the world and not two , i will this ratio as a lower bound on the actual ratio and use the square ( corresponding to four light quarks ) as an upper bound .",
    "lattice determinations of light quark masses are more difficult than the analogous determinations of @xmath9 .",
    "pion masses have worse @xmath32 dependence than the quarkonium splittings . finding nonperturbative ways of eliminating the perturbative relations with the bare lattice quark mass requires more work .    nevertheless , with a few exceptions , most lattice quark mass extractions are consistent with a reasonably simple picture .",
    "i ignore results with very large @xmath32 or very small volume .",
    "unquenched wilson results , which are also hard to interpret in most other quantities , do not seem to make sense compared with quenched wilson results .",
