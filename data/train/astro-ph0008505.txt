    "according to well - established unified schemes for radio - loud agn ( urry & padovani 1995 ) , blazars are distinguished by the fortuitous alignment of their jets along the line of sight .",
    "this greatly enhances the jet radiation , making them ideal sources for understanding jet physics in all radio - loud agn .",
    "the required high energies of the radiating electrons indicate very efficient particle acceleration in the relativistic jets of these sources ( kubo et al .",
    "1998 ; ghisellini et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the bl lac object mrk  421 is unique as the first  and so far , the brightest  high frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) with @xmath1ray emission extending up to tev energies , at a level allowing detailed spectral and variability studies in the broadest spectral range .",
    "the simple continuum spectra of mrk  421 from radio to uv and x  ray bands obtained previously imply that the emission in these energy bands is due to charged particles radiating via the synchrotron process ( e.g. , george , warwick , & bromage 1988 ) .",
    "the hard x  rays and @xmath1rays from this object are likely to be produced by inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons by the same electrons ( e.g. , ulrich , maraschi , & urry 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "judging from the results of previous tev and multi - wavelength monitoring campaigns of mrk  421 , correlations among light curves at different energies ( and , in particular , the pronounced spectral evolution during flares seen in x  rays ) have provided our best opportunity to understand the high energy emission from blazar jets ( macomb et al .",
    "1995 ; buckley et al . 1996",
    "; takahashi et al . 1996 ; wagner 1996 ; takahashi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "specifically , the previous ( 1994 ) campaigns found a soft lag of about 4000  s for soft x  ray ( 0.5  1.0  kev ) photons with respect to the hard x  ray ( 2  7.5  kev ) band , which was interpreted as an effect of radiative cooling ( takahashi et al .",
    "however , the sparse sampling of previous campaigns has prevented us from obtaining definitive conclusions .",
    "uninterrupted monitoring , lasting several times the characteristic time scale , is the only way to investigate quantitatively the extreme physical conditions at the sites of high - energy radiation .",
    "accordingly , we carried out a one - week continuous observation with _ asca _ ,",
    "coordinated with _",
    "euve _ , and _ sax _ . at the same time , tev detectors ( cat , hegra , and whipple ) , optical telescopes , radio antennae at 22  ghz and 37  ghz attempted to monitor the source every night . in this paper , we only present the most important result of the multi - wavelength campaign .",
    "the essential information on the observations is summarized in fig .  1 , which shows the normalized multi - wavelength ( euv , x  ray and tev ) light curves",
    ". the logarithmic flux scale allows flares with equal amplitudes to be represented by equal vertical excursions .",
    "complete details about the data analyses will be given in separate wavelength - based papers ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999 ; fossati et al .",
    "2000a , b ; kataoka et al . 2000a ) ; here we summarize the key points .",
    "continuous coverage in x ",
    "rays with _ asca _ lasted from 1998 april 23.97 to april 30.8 ut , yielding a net exposure of @xmath2 280  ks .",
    "the results presented here are from the sis detectors operated in 1-ccd mode because the count rate of the gis detectors exceeded its telemetry limit for 20  30 % of the observation time .",
    "the background count rate and its fluctuations are negligible , so we did not perform any background subtraction , so as to avoid any artificial effects .",
    "_ sax _ observations of mrk  421 preceded the _",
    "observation by about three days ( maraschi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "_ rxte _ observed the source primarily only in low background orbits in order to minimize uncertainties in the background subtraction .",
    "euve observations covered the whole campaign , lasting from april 19.4 to may 1.2 the @xmath1ray observations at tev energies were made with the cat , hegra and whipple atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "optical observations with bvri filters were performed by the webt collaboration ( mattox et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "radio observations were done at the metshovi radio observatory ( tersranta et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the campaign began during a pronounced high amplitude flare recorded simultaneously by _ sax _ and _ whipple _ ( maraschi et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the high activity of mrk  421 continued throughout the campaign ( fig .  1 ) . the 2  10  kev flux at the beginning of the _ asca _ observation was @xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 and increased up to @xmath6  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 at the maximum .",
    "thanks to the continuous coverage with _ asca _ , the x  ray variations are fully resolved _ with no gaps_. many `` flares '' are seen clearly in the _ asca _ data , superimposed on a general increasing trend .",
    "the _ euve _ light curve also shows a series of flares , less well - defined because of lower amplitude and lower signal - to - noise ratio but well correlated in time with the x  ray flares .",
    "the optical data for the period 24  30 april indicate an r - band flux with mean value 12.6  mag , and variability of less than 0.1  mag about this mean .",
    "the high frequency radio flux did not changed within statistics ; the mean fluxes during the metshovi observations are 0.5  jy for 22  ghz ( 20 - 26 april ) and 0.6  jy for 37 ghz ( 18 - 21 april ) .",
    "in mrk  421 , the euv through x  ray emission comprises the high energy part of the synchrotron component .",
    "comparison of the data from _ asca _ , _ euve _ and _ rxte _ indicates that the variability amplitude in the synchrotron component increases with photon energy . to show this quantitatively",
    ", we computed the fractional rms variability including the general , increasing trend . the calculated rms variability during _ asca _ campaign increases with energy , from @xmath7 in the _ euve _ light curve , to @xmath8 in _ asca _ ( 0.5  7  kev ) , to @xmath9 and @xmath10 for 8  16  kev and 16  40  kev in the _ rxte _ pca data , respectively .",
    "this energy dependence is clear in the multi - epoch multi - frequency spectrum of mrk  421 shown in fig .  2 , where the largest changes in the synchrotron component occur at the highest frequencies .",
    "the complete flare recorded both in x  rays by _ sax _ and in tev @xmath1rays by the whipple telescope demonstrates the correlation between x  ray and tev @xmath1ray emission on the time scale of hours ( maraschi et al .",
    "the tev flux also follows the general week - long rise of the _ asca _ flux ( fig .",
    "10 of takahashi et al . 1999 ) . assuming the cross - calibration among the three tev telescopes is accurate ,",
    "the relative tev intensities at nearby times indicate that large intra - day variations are occuring at these high energies .",
    "fractional tev variability is respectively @xmath11 for the whipple data and @xmath12 for the hegra data .",
    "note that , for the whipple data , @xmath13 during the whole campaign .",
    "these values are similar to the values for the hard x  ray data above 8  kev , consistent with the scenario that both tev and hard x - ray emissons are due to the same electron distribution .    in the subsequent discussion",
    ", we divided the _ asca _",
    "light curve into segments as marked in fig .  3 , with one flare per segment .",
    "in the _ asca _ light curve , most of flares are characterized by nearly equal rise and decay times , i.e. , by a nearly symmetric time profile .",
    "the time constants from the bottom to the top are also similar from one flare to the next , @xmath14  day .",
    "the long , uninterrupted _ asca _ light curve gives an excellent opportunity to study the temporal characteristics of the x  ray variability .",
    "we therefore calculated the first - order _ normalized _ structure function ( sf ) at time lag @xmath15 , which is defined as @xmath16^{2}$ ] , where @xmath17 is the count rate and @xmath18 is the average count rate .",
    "@xmath19 is the total number of data pairs used in the calculation .",
    "the sf is closely related to the power density spectrum ( pds ) distribution ( its slope , @xmath20 , is one less than the pds slope ) but is more suitable when the data sampling is uneven .",
    "the sf calculated from the 2  7.5  kev _ asca _ light curve is shown in fig .",
    "4 . it has a relatively steep slope at high temporal frequencies ( short time scales ) , @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) .",
    "this is at the steep end of the slopes seen in other types of mass - accreting black hole systems , such as seyfert galaxies ( hayashida et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "a sharp break in the structure function of mrk  421 occurs at @xmath23 days , to a flatter slope at low temporal frequencies ( long time scales ) , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is the first report of a clear turnover in the structure function of a blazar x  ray light curve , and it suggests there is at least one characteristic time scale for the variability of mrk  421 . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the same flat slope at longer lag is seen in the structure function for the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) light curve ( 2  10  kev ) , thus confirming the reality of the turnover . in order for the total variability power not to diverge ,",
    "the structure function must flatten still further at longer time scales ; we infer this from the asm data to be at @xmath26  days .",
    "the shape of the structure function is roughly independent of energy from 0.07  7.5  kev , as can be seen from the comparison of structure functions for the _ asca _ data and the _ euve _ data .",
    "the normalized light curves obtained with the sis in two energy bands ( 0.5  1  kev and 3  7.5  kev ) are shown in figs .",
    "3a and 3b , respectively . in general , the amplitude of the variability is larger in hard x ",
    "rays than in soft x  rays . as can be seen from the hardness ratio ( fig .",
    "3c ) , the spectrum becomes harder when the source gets brighter .",
    "generally the spectral changes during individual flares are complex and rapid but in some cases , the hardness ratio remains almost constant . in the flare # 8",
    ", there is a plateau in the soft x  ray band , which is rarely seen . according to detailed analysis of the spectral variability ( kataoka 2000b ) , flare # 1 shows clockwise hysteresis in the correlation between flux and photon index , similar to that reported by takahashi et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "in contrast , we found anti - clockwise hysteresis in flare # 7 . in order to quantify the lag",
    ", we used the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) .",
    "first , we calculated the dcf for the _ asca _ data comparing each of several energy bands to the 4  7.5  kev band using all data .",
    "our results are consistent with zero - lag .",
    "we find the same result even using the _ euve _ data , which offers the largest separation in energy from the hard _ asca _ band .",
    "however , inspection of x  ray light curves at different energies does suggest some energy dependence of the flare shape .",
    "we therefore calculated the lags separately for each flare ( as marked in fig .",
    "3 ) to see if individual flares have different behavior .",
    "3d shows the time lag between 0.5  1  kev photons ( the softest _",
    "asca _ band ) and 4.0  7.5  kev photons , calculated for each flare .",
    "errors of lags are determined from the quadratic sum of the uncertainty in determining the maximum of the dcf distribution and the results of montecarlo calculation which simulate the effect of time windows ( kataoka 2000b ) .",
    "there are both soft ( positive ) and hard ( negative ) lags , with some flares consistent with zero .",
    "the soft lag for flare # 1 is @xmath27  s for 0.5  1.0  kev photons , which is roughly half that found in previous monitoring in 1994 ( takahashi et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in contrast , the lag calculated for flare # 7 is negative ( a hard lag ) , @xmath28  s. these lags may not be real , as it is not possible to reliably determine lags which are much smaller than an orbit .",
    "systematic effects could also produce these lags .",
    "the present multi - wavelength monitoring campaign showed that mrk  421 is much more variable , and that the variability , and its energy dependence , is more complex than anticipated .",
    "the object flares daily ( or perhaps even more often ) , and the correlation of variations in the x  ray and tev energy bands is confirmed , supporting the idea that the same electron distribution in the same physical region is responsible for the emission in both energy bands .",
    "the 2  7  kev energy index obtained with _ asca",
    "_ ranges from @xmath29 to 1.8 .",
    "the energy ranges covered by _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ are thus at or above the peak in the @xmath30f@xmath30 spectrum .",
    "the increasing amplitude of variability at the higher x  ray energies is therefore consistent with the expectations for the synchrotron process , specifically that the higher energy electrons lose their energy more rapidly .",
    "the x  ray variability of mrk  421 is very similar to the intra - day variability observed in the optical light curves of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , for which the high - energy component peaks in the gev @xmath1ray energy band ( wagner et al .",
    "1996 ) . for synchrotron radiation due to a single population of relativistic electrons with a broken power law distribution of index @xmath31 and",
    "a break at @xmath32 , the correspondign frequency for @xmath32 is ( as measured in the observer s frame ) is @xmath33  hz . here",
    "@xmath34 is magnetic field in gauss , measured in the comoving frame , and @xmath35 is the doppler `` beaming '' factor defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the angle of the jet to the line of sight .",
    "several analyses have shown that @xmath32 is lower for fsrqs ( @xmath40  @xmath41 ) and higher for hbls ( @xmath42  @xmath43 ) , as is the case for mrk  421 ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 ; kubo et al . 1998 ; fossati et al .",
    "since the synchrotron emission due to the electrons with @xmath32 corresponds to the ev ( or sub - ev ) range for fsrqs and the kev range for mrk  421 , the rapid , large - amplitude variability observed above @xmath32 is likely the result of the rapid change of the electron distribution , in the regime where acceleration and cooling are approximately balanced ( e.g. , inoue & takahara 1996 ; kirk et al . 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , the structure function of mrk  421 derived from the x  ray light curve is very similar to the structure functions found in optical and radio studies of fsrqs , with a break at a characteristic time scale of one day ( wagner & witzel 1995 ; wagner et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the _ asca _ light curve constrains the dominant variability time scales to be less than one day .",
    "the quasi - symmetric flare profiles imply that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are shorter than the source light - crossing time @xmath46 , because faster time scales will always be smoothed out by @xmath46 ( chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ; kataoka et al .",
    "a plateau also occurs when the time scale for injecting energetic electrons , @xmath47 , is longer than @xmath45 .",
    "in this situation , emission from individual slices does not fade as quickly after an increase , hence the observation of a plateau in the light curve occurs when the entire volume is radiating .",
    "we do observe a plateau in the last flare ( segment # 8) , which is much more obvious at low energies , where the cooling time is longer .",
    "a simple conceptual scenario for multiple flares is that a cloud , or a `` blob '' of plasma passes through the region where shock fronts are formed and electrons are accelerated .",
    "if we assume the opening angle of the jet is proportional to @xmath48 , where the size of the blob at distance @xmath49 from the base of the jet can be expressed as @xmath50 . with this",
    ", the characteristic time scale of @xmath14  days ( from the structure function analysis ) implies that the emission region has size @xmath51 @xmath52  cm at distance @xmath53  cm from the black hole , if we assume that @xmath54 .",
    "further discussion of the characteristic time scale and a comparison with other tev blazars and seyfert galaxies is presented elsewhere ( kataoka et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "if the detection of both positive and negative lags are real , it implies that cooling is sometimes but not always the dominant process , and that acceleration is also important .",
    "the ( familiar ) soft lag can be explained by the fact that @xmath45 is shorter for higher energy electrons ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the energy densities of the magnetic field and the soft photons to be upscattered , respectively . when high energy electrons are injected into the emitting region and then cool radiatively , the soft photons lag the hard , by a time roughly equal to the cooling time at the soft energy ( takahashi et al .",
    "conversely , the suggested hard lag can be explained , at least qualitatively , if the acceleration time is sufficiently long , @xmath58 , electrons appear first at low energies and gradually build up at higher energies ( georganopoulos & marscher 1998 ) .",
    "the relatively small lags , also mean @xmath59 at x  ray energies , at least during the present observations .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the x  ray band is emitted by the highest energy regime of the electron distribution , where @xmath44 is approximately balanced with @xmath45 . according to the shock acceleration scenario , @xmath44 depends on energy in an opposite sense to @xmath45 .",
    "it follows @xmath60 for diffusive acceleration with a ` gyro - bohm ' process ( e.g. inoue & takahara 1996 ) or @xmath61 for fully developed kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "similar discussions have been made by several authors ( e.g. sambruna 1999 ) .    at a minimum ,",
    "the present observations underline the need for detailed time - dependent synchrotron models , in which the time scales for electron acceleration and injection , and for radiative cooling and escape , are free to vary ( e.g. , kirk et al .",
    "depending on the relative values of these time scales , a variety of behaviors can be expected in the light curves .",
    "the fact that plateaus are rarely seen implies the dominant time scale is similar to the light - crossing time , which in term supports the idea the the size of the emitting region is determined by diffusion and cooling .",
