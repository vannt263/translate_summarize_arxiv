    "self - avoiding walks ( saws ) and polygons ( saps ) on regular lattices are among the most important and classic combinatorial problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "saws are often considered in the context of lattice models of polymers while saps are used to model vesicles .",
    "the fundamental problem is the calculation ( up to translation ) of the number of saws , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 steps ( saps , @xmath2 , of perimeter @xmath1 ) . as for many interesting combinatorial problems ,",
    "saws have exponential growth , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the connective constant , @xmath5 is a critical exponent , and @xmath6 is a critical amplitude .",
    "a major challenge ( short of an exact solution ) is the calculation , or at least accurate estimation of , @xmath4 , critical exponents and amplitudes . here",
    "our focus is on the numerical estimation of such quantities from exact enumeration data .    the success of series expansions as a numerical technique has relied crucially on several of tony guttmann s contributions to the field a asymptotic series analysis . in pioneering the method of differential approximants",
    "( see @xcite for a review and ` historical notes ' ) tony guttmann has given us an invaluable tool which over the years has been proved to be by far the best ( in terms both of accuracy and versatility ) method for analysing series . in this paper",
    "we use long series expansions for self - avoiding polygons and walks on the honeycomb lattice to test the accuracy of various methods for series analysis . for the honeycomb lattice",
    "the connective constant , critical exponents and many amplitude ratios are known exactly , making it the perfect test - bed for series analysis techniques .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : th ] we give precise definitions of the models and the properties we investigate and summarise a number of exact results .",
    "section  [ sec : enum ] contains a very brief introduction to the literature describing the algorithms used for the exact enumerations . in section  [ sec : da ] we give a brief introduction to the numerical technique of differential approximants and then proceed to analyse the sap and saw series clearly demonstrating how we can obtain very accurate estimates for the connective constant and critical exponents .",
    "section  [ sec : ampl ] is concerned with the estimation of amplitudes .",
    "not only do we obtain very accurate estimates for the amplitudes , but we also show how an analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the series coefficients can be used to gain insight into corrections to scaling . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : sum ] we discuss and summarise our main results .",

    "the analysis provided firm numerical evidence that @xmath54 as predicted by nienhuis .",
    "the algorithm we used to enumerate saps on the honeycomb lattice is based on the finite - lattice method devised by enting @xcite in his pioneering work , which contains a detailed description of the original approach for enumerating saps on the square lattice .",

    "the only slightly tricky part is the calculation of metric properties ( though the changes are very similar to those required for the triangular lattice @xcite ) .    using the a parallel version of our honeycomb lattice algorithms we have counted the number of self - avoiding walks and polygons to length 105 and 158 , respectively . for",
    "self - avoiding walks to length 96 we also calculate series for the metric properties of mean - square end - to - end distance , mean - square radius of gyration and the mean - square distance of a monomer from the end points .",
    "in fact the algorithm calculates the metric generating functions with coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively , the advantage being that these quantities are integer valued . for self - avoiding polygons to length 140",
    "we calculate series for the mean - square radius of gyration and the first 10 moments of the area .",
    "again we actually calculate the series with integer coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the majority of interesting models in statistical mechanics and combinatorics have generating functions with regular singular points such as those indicated in ( [ eq : sawgf ] ) and ( [ eq : sapgf ] ) .",
    "the fundamental problem of series analysis is : given a _ finite _ number of terms in the series expansion for a function @xmath60 what can one say about the singular behaviour which after all is a property of the _ infinite _ series . without a doubt the best series analysis technique when it comes to locating singularities and estimating the associated critical exponents is differential approximants ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of differential approximants and other techniques for series analysis ) .",
    "the basic idea is to approximate the function @xmath60 by solutions to differential equations with polynomial coefficients .",
    "the singular behaviour of such odes is much studied ( see @xcite ) and the singular points and exponents are easily calculated .    a @xmath61-order differential approximant ( da ) to a function @xmath60 is formed by matching the coefficients in the polynomials @xmath62 and @xmath63 of degree @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respective , so that ( one ) of the formal solutions to the inhomogeneous differential equation @xmath66 agrees with the first @xmath67 series coefficients of @xmath68 .",
    "singularities of @xmath60 are approximated by the zeros @xmath69 of @xmath70 and the associated critical exponent @xmath71 is estimated from the indicial equation .",
    "if there is only a single root at @xmath69 this is just @xmath72 the physical critical point is the first singularity on the positive real axis .    in order to locate the singularities of the series in a systematic fashion we used the following procedure : we calculate all @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] second- and third - order inhomogeneous differential approximants with @xmath75 , that is the degrees of the polynomials @xmath76 differ by at most 2 .",
    "in addition we demand that the total number of terms used by the da is at least @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the total number of terms available in the series .",
    "each approximant yields @xmath79 possible singularities and associated exponents from the @xmath79 zeroes of @xmath70 ( many of these are of course not actual singularities of the series but merely spurious zeros . )",
    "next these zeroes are sorted into equivalence classes by the criterion that they lie at most a distance @xmath80 apart .",
    "an equivalence class is accepted as a singularity if it appears in more than 75% of the total number of approximants , and an estimate for the singularity and exponent is obtained by averaging over the included approximants ( the spread among the approximants is also calculated ) .",
    "the calculation was then repeated for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 until a minimal value of 8 was reached . to avoid outputting well - converged singularities at every level ,",
    "once an equivalence class has been accepted , the data used in the estimate is discarded , and the subsequent analysis is carried out on the remaining data only .",
    "one advantage of this method is that spurious outliers , some of which will almost always be present when so many approximants are generated , are discarded systematically and automatically .",

    "after inclusion of this term estimates for the leading amplitude @xmath116 were well behaved when including only analytic corrections and we found @xmath142 .",
