    "the matter content of the highly successful standard model ( sm ) of particle physics was generally considered to be fully revealed after the discovery of the top quark in 1994  @xcite .",
    "while the exact mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) remains undetermined  @xcite , the unusually large top quark mass  @xcite , of the same size as the ewsb scale , suggests that the top quark may play a special role . taking a closer experimental look at the top quark is therefore high on our list of priorities  not to mention that its quantum numbers ( other than mass ) and couplings to other sm particles are only crudely known , or not known at all  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the production and subsequent decay of the top quark at current and future collider experiments is a serious background to many new physics searches .",
    "thus it is essential to study top quark production in much more detail , and eventually to be able to simulate it accurately in monte carlo background studies .",
    "the top quark sample that exists today , exclusively from runs  i and ii of the fermilab tevatron , is rather small , a few hundred events .",
    "this shall soon increase by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the tevatron experiments cdf and d  are beginning to study the amount of additional jet activity in top quark pair events , and early indications are that it is non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "there are also hints in the data from run  i that the kinematic distribution of the top quark pairs decay products exhibit a charge asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we reexamine qcd top quark pair production in @xmath0 collisions at tevatron run  ii energy , with special attention to the asymmetries in the production process and to the correlation of the asymmetries with extra radiation in top quark pair events .",
    "in fact , the presence of both the asymmetries and extra radiation have been theoretically expected for some time , but neither the structure of the asymmetries nor their correlations with extra radiation are fully reproduced by the standard tools used in experimental analysis .",
    "we make the case here that it is now time to study the asymmetry and its correlation with the extra radiation in detail . in sec .",
    "[ sec : prod ] we review inclusive qcd top quark pair production at hadron colliders , including known next - to - leading order ( nlo ) effects .",
    "previous work had identified an overall asymmetry for top quark pairs at leading order ( lo )  @xcite and nlo  @xcite , although it did not identify all the kinematic features present .",
    "we present updated results for the asymmetry at nlo , for both inclusive and exclusive samples . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tt1j ] we present new results for the real emission component of inclusive @xmath1 production , where the asymmetry is shown as a differential distribution as a function of the kinematics of the extra hard radiation .",
    "we provide an analysis of the likely statistical uncertainties in a variety of scenarios with various luminosities , kinematic cuts and tagging efficiencies .",
    "we do not consider the questions of systematics and background rates in any detail .  in sections  [ sec : excl0j ] and",
    "[ sec : tt2j ] we study the asymmetry for @xmath1 production in the zero jet exclusive sample ( additional jet activity is vetoed ) and double jet sample , respectively . section  [ sec : psmc ] provides a discussion of the level of asymmetry that can be found in parton - shower monte carlo ( psmc ) results where the nlo perturbative ( coherent ) asymmetry effects , as described in the previous sections , are not present .",
    "finally we review our results and conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "at lo , @xmath1 production is totally charge - conjugation symmetric for both production mechanisms , quark- and gluon - fusion : @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "the angular distributions of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are totally symmetric for @xmath0 collisions . however , at higher orders in @xmath6 , this no longer remains true for all subprocesses .",
    "as was pointed out almost two decades ago  @xcite , not all processes involving additional partons are symmetric under charge conjugation with respect to the incoming proton and anti - proton beams .",
    "the process @xmath7 is , but the processes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not .",
    "processes involving initial state valence quarks will therefore exhibit a forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "this is caused by interference between initial- and final - state gluon emission ( or its crossed process ) , analogous to what happens in qed , _",
    "e.g. _ , the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath10 or other heavy fermion pairs  @xcite . because @xmath1 production at the tevatron is dominated at the @xmath11 level by @xmath12 annihilation",
    ", we can expect the @xmath12 subprocess asymmetry to be closely reflected in the total sample .    when the @xmath13 cross section was calculated more fully at nlo  @xcite , an asymmetry due to virtual corrections was noticed .",
    "it arises from an interference between the color - singlet 4-point ( box ) virtual correction and the born term for the process @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite examined this asymmetry more closely , although still inclusively and integrated over the phase space of the additional parton .",
    "it was found that the virtual contribution produces an asymmetry opposite in sign to and larger than that of the real emission component .",

    ", herwig  @xcite and sherpa  @xcite do not include the full interference effects in the parton radiation that produce the asymmetry , they can not be used to predict the asymmetry . however , as we will discuss later , the soft radiation models used in the monte carlos are capable of producing certain kinds of asymmetries , which must be understood in order to accurately analyze any asymmetries that may be in the experimental data . in our perturbative calculations",

    "their ratio is only 0.19 , indicating that the calculation is perturbative .",
    "however , because @xmath34 is calculated only at lo , there is a considerable residual uncertainty of probably a factor of two at the tevatron energy .",
    "this means there is also a larger uncertainty in the @xmath24 exclusive rate compared to the nlo inclusive rate , since the former is effectively calculated at lo .",
    "for example , we choose the top quark mass , @xmath35 , as the factorization and renormalization scales in our benchmark cross section .",
    "this is conservative because it lies at the low end of our estimates for the lo @xmath25 rate .",
    "however , if we choose scales that take into account the softness of the additional radiation parton , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath36 , the cross section can be twice as large as our benchmark point . even in this case",

    "the structure of the asymmetry described above can be seen in fig .",

    "the @xmath24 exclusive cross section ( dashed curve ) exhibits a shift that is similar in terms of magnitude and direction .",
    "on the other hand , the lo @xmath25 inclusive cross section ( dot - dashed curve ) is shifted in the opposite direction in each panel yielding a negative asymmetry .  thus we conclude that the real emission corrections tend to push the top quark backward , opposite to the proton beam direction , while the virtual corrections push it forward , in the direction of the proton beam .",

    "the lo asymmetry vanishes , the nlo inclusive and @xmath24 exclusive asymmetries are positive , and the asymmetry result for the @xmath38 inclusive distribution is negative .  when considering these results , it is important to recall that the magnitudes ( but not the signs ) of the last two entries in the table depend on the @xmath29 cut defining the jets , which in this case has the value @xmath55gev .",
    "nlo final states with extra real emission above the cut are included in the lo @xmath25 inclusive sample and exhibit a negative asymmetry .",
    "the corresponding real emission configurations below the cut are included in the @xmath24 exclusive result , where they partially cancel the virtual contributions with a positive asymmetry reducing the net asymmetry in this term .",

    "our numerical results differ slightly from those of ref .",
    "@xcite due partly to the higher energy , but also due to the different pdf set used here .",
    "the obvious question to ask is , can tevatron run  ii measure the various inclusive and exclusive asymmetries predicted by perturbative qcd ? observing the top quark asymmetry in a collider experiment such as tevatron run  ii is complicated by the difficulty in accurately reconstructing the underlying parton kinematics from the measurements of jets , compared to leptons . because top quarks are produced at the tevatron with transverse momentum typically smaller than their mass , their decay products are distributed over a large solid angle .",
    "mismeasurement of individual jets thus results in a non - negligible uncertainty in the top quark direction .",
    "one should then look instead at the decay products , since any forward - backward top quark asymmetry will manifest itself in the daughter particles as well , albeit with possibly different magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath56 jets are tagged , but their charge is extremely difficult to determine , so they are not good candidates . nor are hadronically - decaying @xmath57 bosons , again because of jet mismeasurement issues , but also because light - flavor jet charges can not be determined at all .",
    "instead we propose to use the asymmetry of the final state leptons ( electron or muon ) from @xmath57 decays , since the the direction of leptons is extremely well - measured .",
    "top quark pairs decay to two possible final states containing a lepton : both top quarks can decay to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , which we call the dilepton  final state ; or one decays to @xmath58 while the other decays to @xmath60 , which we call the lepton+jets  final state . the cleanest sample experimentally is the dilepton sample , although it occurs at only about 1/6 the rate of the lepton+jets channel . assuming both @xmath56 jets are tagged , the dilepton sample has practically no background from other sm processes , while the lepton+jets channel has a signal to background ( s : b ) ratio of about 6:1  @xcite .",
    "the dilepton channel has the added advantage that there is no confusion between the additional radiated hard jet in the event and jets from the @xmath57 boson decay , as in the lepton+jets sample .",
    "since these events include jets along with the leptons , we will find it informative to examine the correlations between the lepton forward - backward asymmetry and the kinematic properties of the jets .    to obtain a handle on the expected lepton asymmetries we calculate using matrix elements for @xmath13 production , including decay spin correlations and treating the intermediate @xmath57 bosons off - shell , as generated by madgraph  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate cross sections at @xmath61  tev and use factorization and renormalization scale choices of @xmath62 ( the small dependence on the total energy and the factorization / renormalization scales will not be an issue here ) . before top",
    "quark decays , the cross section is 4.87  pb , compared to 6.7 - 8.0  pb for the nlo+(n)nll @xmath1 rate  @xcite .",
    "we will normalize our results to the nlo rate for our inclusive results ; using the average of the two nlo results , 7.4  pb , the effective k - factor is 1.52 .    to calculate cross sections for observable final states at the parton level",
    ", we use our lo madgraph code normalized to the nlo rate , then impose generic kinematic cuts on the outgoing particles suitable for both d  and cdf : @xmath63 the cuts are very conservative compared to the cdf and dexpectations for the majority of run  ii , but reflect the present level of understanding of the detectors and are used in current top quark analyses  @xcite .",
    "for example , muons can easily be identified out to a pseudorapidity of 2.0 , and non-@xmath56 jets can be identified for @xmath64  gev .",
    "for both the dilepton and lepton+jets final states we discuss below , we consider the possibility of increasing the statistics by loosening the cuts accordingly .",
    "we do not attempt to simulate detector effects .",
    "regardless of the decay mode , we define the lepton asymmetry as a_fb^= , [ eq : asym - ll ] where the lepton may be @xmath65 or @xmath66 , depending on which is visible ( or both , in dilepton events , but @xmath67 and @xmath68 are calculated separately ) .",
    "once a cross section with cuts is obtained , the nlo - normalized number of expected events for a given luminosity and set of detector i d efficiencies is distributed into forward and backward bins such that the asymmetry is the same @xmath49 as that predicted at nlo by mcfm _ for the top quarks_. it is important to point out , as we will see later explicitly in the @xmath25 section  [ sec : tt1j ] , that kinematic cuts can alter the asymmetry for a given subsample .",
    "hence our procedure is only an approximation .",
    "however , as no nlo @xmath1 program yet has the capability to decay the top quarks with spin correlations intact at nlo , our approximation is the best we can accomplish at the moment . hopefully it will be superseded in the near future .      when both top quarks decay leptonically , the final state in the detector is @xmath69 , where @xmath59 and @xmath70 is missing energy transverse to the beam axis , resulting from the neutrinos which escape undetected .",
    "we assume that both @xmath56 jets are tagged , rendering the backgrounds negligible .",
    "this is thus the cleanest top quark pair sample in the data .",
    "the cross section with dilepton kinematic cuts and nlo k - factor applied is 113  fb .",
    "we begin with a very conservative baseline assumption of @xmath71 for the double @xmath56-tagging efficiency , which we label @xmath72 . for 4  fb@xmath73 and straightforwardly combining the statistics of d  and cdf ( _ i.e. _ , a factor of 2 ) , we estimate about 180 events in the dilepton sample with two @xmath56 tags summed over @xmath59 . the statistical uncertainty on an asymmetry is given in ref .",
    "@xcite : a_fb^== where @xmath74 is the number of observed events with the lepton @xmath75 forward ( backward ) .",
    "taking @xmath43 as a good symmetry we have @xmath76 ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) and we can combine the statistics of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 channels .",
    "for the dilepton sample this means that each event contributes twice .  combining the two charges",
    "also yields a factor @xmath79 improvement in overall significance of the asymmetry determination over the single sign analysis .",
    "we summarize the dilepton channel results in table  [ tab : dela - tt ] .",
    "we see that the initial numbers for the dilepton channel yield an uncertainty in the asymmetry measurement of @xmath80 , providing only a @xmath81 effect with the summed sign data . we conclude that it will be challenging to use the dilepton channel due to poor statistics , at least with our conservative assumptions . however , there are many opportunities for increasing the sample size .    here",
    "we explore various prospects for improving the sample size coming from multiple sources , of varying likelihood .",
    "the results are illustrated in table [ tab : dela - tt ] .",
    "first , the lepton cuts can be loosened by observing leptons out to a pseudorapidity of 2.0 instead of 1.1 , which is already possible for muons .",
    "this adds @xmath82 to the observed rate .",
    "lowering the @xmath29 cut of only one lepton to 10  gev adds another @xmath83 .",
    "another few percent improvement will automatically come from events where one or both @xmath57 bosons decay to a tau lepton , which then decays to an electron or muon . imposing looser lepton cuts but ignoring the contribution from taus",
    ", we obtain a rate enhancement of about a factor of @xmath84 so that the uncertainty decreases slightly , to @xmath85 .",
    "the measurement becomes @xmath86 as indicated in the second line of table [ tab : dela - tt ] .",
    "we also expect that the @xmath56-tag efficiency should be improved noticeably , both by adding kinematic track information in a neural net analysis to the vertex tag , and by beginning to include soft lepton tags , which is about @xmath87 per @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "together , these highly likely improvements to @xmath56-jet tagging would enlarge the sample by another factor of @xmath84 .",
    "third , run  ii could achieve its stretch  goal of about 8  fb@xmath73 , which would double the sample .",
    "taken together ( the most optimistic scenario ) , these improvements would result in a dilepton sample more about seven times what our conservative scenario predicts . in this case",
    ", the asymmetry in the dilepton channel is still challenging , yielding a @xmath88 measurement of the inclusive asymmetry as indicated in the fourth line of table [ tab : dela - tt ] .",
    "it is fair to ask how feasible these improvements are .",
    "the expanded lepton pseudorapidity coverage is a safe bet , while the lowered-@xmath29 cut is possible but not guaranteed ( and also does nt result in much gain , compared to increased angular coverage ) .",
    "the @xmath56-jet tagging efficiency will definitely improve noticeably with the addition of soft lepton tags , while the prospects for improved silicon vertex tags are not yet fully understood .",
    "we can not guess at the total integrated luminosity of run  ii , but anticipate continued efforts at improvement .",
    "another natural possibility to consider is requiring only one @xmath56-tag , which with the assumed improved tagging efficiency would increase the sample by about a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "while this approach introduces some sm background , the background contribution will not be large .",
    "ultimately this must be taken into account , although it is beyond the scope of this paper . ignoring the small contribution from background",
    ", a single @xmath56-tag strategy would result in an uncertainty of @xmath90 and yield a @xmath91 @xmath92 measurement as indicated in the fifth line in table [ tab : dela - tt ] .",
    "we note that it may also be possible to usefully study a zero @xmath56-tag dilepton sample .",
    "half this sample , containing an @xmath93 mixed - flavor pair , has extremely low backgrounds . the primary background for the other half , @xmath94 or @xmath95 events , arises from the drell - yan process with an intermediate @xmath96 boson with a substantial ( @xmath97 ) asymmetry .",
    "we expect this background can be controlled by cutting away the @xmath96-pole region and demanding extra jets .",
    "we also mention one other possible scheme for improving the measurement in the dilepton sample . instead of an asymmetry based on a single lepton",
    "being forward versus background in the laboratory frame , consider one based on the longitudinal ordering of the 2 leptons ,    @xmath98    a preliminary look at the inclusive asymmetry using mcfm @xcite suggests that @xmath99 may be @xmath100 larger than @xmath101 .",

    "complete fixed - order perturbative calculations account explicitly for the color - coherence , at fixed order , but monte carlo simulations include color - flow correlations only approximately , based on various models .  to illustrate this , we have studied @xmath1 dilepton production using pythia  @xcite .",
    "we imposed the cuts of eq .",
    "[ eq : cuts ] on the @xmath56 partons , leptons , and missing transverse momentum in pythia - generated @xmath1 dilepton events . to identify extra radiation",
    ", we used the ` pycell ` subroutine with a cone size of @xmath192 .",
    "any reconstructed jets were required to be @xmath193 away from the @xmath56 partons to be considered extra radiation .  as the matrix elements used by pythia are lo , the lepton and antilepton distributions are the same , and the fully inclusive asymmetry is zero .",
    "the situation is more interesting when extra radiation is demanded or vetoed .",
    "in particular , correlations can be introduced by the angular structure of the all - orders qcd showering simulated in the monte carlo .",
    "for example , in pythia the parameters",
    "` mstj(50 ) ` and ` mstp(67 ` ) control the structure of the final state ( ` mstj(50 ) ` ) and initial state ( ` mstp(67 ) ` ) showers .  with the default values ( the on  value ) for these two parameters",
    ", pythia adds initial- and final - state radiation to events based on color - flow information , while for the offvalue the showers develop independently of the color information and largely independently of the rest of the event .",
    "the color - flow constraint for the on  case has the effect of restricting radiation to appear preferentially in the angular region between the @xmath194 direction and the produced top quark direction , or between the @xmath195 direction and the anti - top quark direction .",
    "thus the presence of extra radiation tends to be correlated with larger angle scattering of the top quark , _",
    "i.e_. , the top quark tends to be in the backward hemisphere when radiation is present .",
    "this correlation is intended to approximate the structure  expected as a result of the color coherence  in a full , all orders matrix element analysis with color singlet asymptotic states",
    ".  not only can this feature of pythia lead to a non - zero lepton forward - backward asymmetry in the presence of extra radiation ( even when integrated over the rapidity of the radiation ) , but this asymmetry has the same sign and general correlation with the radiation as in the earlier @xmath25 perturbative analysis , as we now explore .",
    "note that , by implication , the complementary event sample ( with a veto on radiation ) has an asymmetry of the opposite sign if the entire sample is to have a zero inclusive asymmetry .",
    "this means that the exclusive sample in pythia will have an asymmetry of the same sign as the @xmath24 exclusive sample .    as in our earlier discussion of the matrix element calculations",
    ", @xmath43 invariance requires that the @xmath66 distribution is always mirror - antisymmetric to that of the @xmath65 about @xmath130 , @xmath196 .",
    "if the color - flow correlations in pythia are turned off  ( ` mstp(67 ) ` and ` mstj(50 ) ` off ) , the final state has no knowledge of the @xmath51 ( non - invariant ) structure of the initial state and ( as in the earlier discussion ) @xmath197 leading to a mirror - antisymmetric function of the jet rapidity @xmath198 .",

    "the lesson here is that , even though pythia does not ( can not ) exhibit the inclusive forward - backward asymmetry characteristic of nlo qcd , pythia does include parameters that can be set to produce events with much of the correlated asymmetry structure of nlo qcd .",
    "however , the agreement is only qualitative .  _ in detail _ the asymmetries in the pythia event samples have neither the same magnitude nor the same dependence on the extra radiation as the matrix element prediction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the dashed and dot - dashed curves in figs .  [ fig : ptasym_pythia2 ] and  [ fig : etaasym_pythia1 ] are distinct .",
    "at least one underlying difference is that pythia includes fsr from the b quark in the top decay , which we do not include in the matrix element calculations .  to the extent that the color - flow structure in pythia correctly reflects coherence effects in the higher order showering corrections , beyond nlo , the asymmetries exhibited by pythia are suggestive of what higher - order perturbative analyses will yield .",
    "we have not studied herwig  @xcite extensively except to confirm that the inclusive asymmetry is not present .",
    "it may or may not have correlated asymmetries similar to those observed with pythia arising from color - flow related constraints on extra radiation from showers .",
    "we have performed no analogous analyses with sherpa  @xcite .",
    "however , future studies using these generators should be aware that these correlated asymmetries may be present .  in any case",
    ", it is clear that the experimental study of asymmetries , both inclusive and exclusive , can yield information about the coherence structure of qcd showers .  to the extent that top quark physics is a background in studies of physics beyond the standard model",
    ", we must come to understand quantitatively these correlations and asymmetries in monte carlo simulations .",
    "top quark pair production at a @xmath0 collider exhibits a forward - backward asymmetry due to higher - order short - distance qcd effects .",
    "this has been known for almost two decades , but only at an abstract theoretical level .",
    "contributions to the asymmetry arise both from virtual corrections to @xmath207 , due to interference between the color - singlet box ( 4-pt . ) and born terms , and from real gluon emission in the same subprocess , due to interference of emission between the initial and final states ( although one can not think of it physically so simply , because those and other diagrams for emission are gauge - related ) .",
    "the two contributions are opposite in sign and of similar magnitude , leading to a partial cancellation which leaves a smaller asymmetry in the inclusive sample of the same sign as the virtual piece .    we have explored the asymmetry here with an eye toward experimental measurement",
    ". there are several major new points .",
    "first , experimentally the most reliable avenue for measuring the asymmetry is likely via the charged leptons , where both the direction and the sign of the charge can be determined with confidence .",
    "unfortunately , we can not test this approach in detail for an inclusive @xmath1 sample without a ( currently unavailable ) full nlo calculation including the @xmath4 decays .  for the @xmath25 sample ( requiring extra radiation ) , where the asymmetry appears at lowest non - trivial order",
    ", our results do confirm that the asymmetry at the top quark level is reflected in the top quark decay products , although with different magnitude .",
    "this change in the magnitude is due to the top quarks spins leading to decay products being emitted preferentially in certain directions , which can move them from one hemisphere to another .",
    "secondly , we have pointed out that the asymmetry of the leptons  in the @xmath25 sample is correlated with the angular distribution of additional jets in the event , but not their transverse momentum .",
    "unfortunately , the real - emission asymmetries , which we term the @xmath25 and @xmath183 components , are presently known only at lo . these last aspects of the short - distance asymmetry were not previously noticed in the literature .",
    "finally we have studied the likely numbers of events at the tevatron for the fully inclusive @xmath1 sample , where we assume the leptonic asymmetry is equal to the top - quark asymmetry , the radiation - required @xmath25 sample , and the jet - veto - based exclusive @xmath24 sample .  in all cases statistics",
    "will be an issue at the tevatron , requiring a multiple channel analysis with ( hopefully ) outstanding accelerator and detector performance .",
    "we have also shown that some models for color - flow correlations in qcd showers can yield correlated asymmetries as well , as exemplified in the parton shower monte carlo pythia@xcite .",
    "while the lepton asymmetry always vanishes in the totally inclusive pythia - generated sample , when the relevant shower parameters are set ( to the default values ) to exhibit a specific model of color - flow structure  in the parton showers , a negative top quark asymmetry arises in the @xmath25 component with a positive asymmetry in the corresponding exclusive @xmath208 component .",
    "both the overall magnitude of the asymmetry and the differential asymmetry with respect to the additional hard jet angular distribution are qualitatively similar to but different in detail from those predicted by the perturbative nlo results .",
    "we again emphasize that we have tried to explore only the general structure of the @xmath1 asymmetry signal and that , due to a number of limitations in the current theoretical tools , our results should not be regarded as precise predictions .",
    "we review here the major sources of those uncertainties / questions , which should be considered as areas that theorists need to address in the near future :    * how does the inclusive asymmetry change once kinematic cuts are imposed on the decay products ?",
    "no nlo calculation exists to address this question . *",
    "what is the overall @xmath25 normalization , which is known presently only at lo ?",
    "additionally , we need to evaluate the nlo rate including decays so that cuts may be imposed .",
    "* what is the effect of radiative top quark decays on experimental efficiencies for correctly selecting the extra jet in the inclusive production - radiation @xmath25 sample ?",
    "we need this to be able to isolate the maximally - asymmetric region in @xmath145 . *",
    "we need to properly merge the @xmath25 matrix elements into the parton - shower monte carlo environment in order to be able to make complete predictions .    while the experimental measurement of the asymmetries described here will likely be a challenge at the tevatron due to limited statistics , it is still an extremely important goal . since top quarks may well have a unique connection to new physics , and since they play a large role as a background in many new physics searches , tevatron experimentalists should strive to determine top quark properties as accurately as possible .",
    "further , the analysis of the correlation between the asymmetry and extra radiation may offer a nearly unique opportunity to elucidate detailed properties of long - distance , all - orders qcd , _",
    "i.e. _ , the color - flow  structure of the parton shower .",
    "while the measurement of @xmath101 is unlikely to be a direct probe for new physics , unless the new physics contributions to the asymmetry are extremely large or of opposite sign to the sm , this measurement still provides a good example of the subtle behavior of sm particles in unexpected places .",
    "we should understand the sm as well as possible , from both theory and data , before moving on to see what lies beyond .",
