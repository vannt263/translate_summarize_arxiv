    "strange stars made entirely of deconfined quarks have long been proposed as a possible alternative to neutron stars ( e.g. , witten 1984 ; alcock , farhi , & olinto 1986a ; haensel , zdunik , & schaeffer 1986 ) .",
    "because strange quark matter ( sqm ) at the surface of a bare strange star is bound by strong interactions , not by gravity , such a star can radiate with luminosities greatly exceeding the eddington limit .",
    "luminosities as high as @xmath9  ergs  s@xmath2 can be radiated briefly after the formation of the star , when the surface temperature is @xmath10  k ( alcock et al . 1986a ; chmaj , haensel , & slomiski 1991 ; usov 1998 , 2001a ) .",
    "some 10 seconds after formation , @xmath11 drops to less than @xmath12  k ( page & usov 2002 ) . at such temperatures  which may also prevail later in the life of the star due to episodes of reheating  electron - positron ( @xmath0 ) pairs created by the coulomb barrier at the surface take up most of the thermal emission from the sqm surface ( usov 2001a ) .",
    "some of these pairs annihilate into photons , thus forming a pair - photon wind that flows away from the star .    for the typical radius of a strange star ( @xmath13  cm ) ,",
    "a temperature of @xmath14  k gives an energy injection rate in pairs @xmath15 ergs  s@xmath2 ( usov 2001a ) .",
    "for such powerful winds the pair density near the surface is very high , and the outflowing pairs and photons are very nearly in thermal equilibrium almost up to the wind photosphere ( e.g. , paczyski 1990 ) .",
    "the outflow may then be described fairly well by relativistic hydrodynamics ( paczyski 1986 , 1990 ; goodman 1986 ; grimsrud & wasserman 1998 ; iwamoto & takahara 2002 ) . the emerging emission consists mostly of photons , so @xmath16 .",
    "the photon spectrum is roughly a black body with a temperature of @xmath17  k. the emerging luminosity in @xmath0 pairs is very small , @xmath18 .",
    "all this applies roughly down to @xmath19 ergs  s@xmath2 .    in contradistinction , for @xmath20 ergs  s@xmath2 ( @xmath21 k ) , which is the region we explore , the thermalization time for the pairs and photons is longer than the escape time , and pairs and photons are not in thermal equilibrium . in this letter , we describe ( for the first time to our knowledge ) the results of numerical calculations of the characteristics of the emerging emission in pairs and photons in stationary winds with energy injection rates @xmath22 ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "the details of the set - up , code , processes included , and the results for the wind structure , will be described elsewhere ( aksenov , milgrom , & usov 2003 ) . here",
    "we give a brief account .",
    "at the moment of formation of a strange star , the temperature in the stellar interior is expected to be a few times @xmath23 k ( haensel , paczyski , & amsterdamski 1991 ; cheng & dai 2001 ) .",
    "the neutrino luminosity of such a hot strange star is up to @xmath24 ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "the rate of neutrino - induced ejection of normal matter , which may be present at the sqm surface ( alcock et al . 1986a ; glendenning & weber 1992 ) , is very high ( e.g. , woosley & baron 1992 ; levinson & eichler 1993 ) .",
    "most probably , in a few seconds after the star forms , the normal - matter envelope is blown away completely ( usov 2001a ) .",
    "the sqm surface remains exposed so as long as the surface temperature is higher than @xmath25 k ( usov 1997 ) . from the thermal evolution of young bare strange stars it follows that this may be the case for at least a few hundred years after formation , and perhaps a few orders longer , depending on the phase of sqm , convection , etc .",
    "( page & usov 2002 )    we consider an @xmath0 pair wind that flows away from a hot , bare , unmagnetized , strange star with a radius of @xmath26 cm .",
    "pairs are injected from time @xmath27 at a constant rate into the wind , which is assumed spherical .",
    "this results in a time - dependent wind which eventually becomes stationary .",
    "we solve numerically the coupled , relativistic boltzmann equations for the pairs and photons ( e.g. , mezzacappa & bruenn 1993 ; aksenov et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath28   \\nonumber",
    "\\\\   = \\sum_q\\left[\\eta_i^q-\\chi_i^q e_i\\right ] , \\label{boltzmann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are the @xmath30-phase - space energy densities of @xmath0 pairs ( @xmath31 ) and photons ( @xmath32 ) ( @xmath33 being the distribution functions ) ; @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the angle between the radius - vector @xmath37 and the particle momentum @xmath38 ; @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; @xmath41 is the particle energy ; @xmath42 is the emission coefficient for the energy production by a particle of type @xmath43 via the physical process labelled by @xmath44 ; and , @xmath45 is the corresponding absorption coefficient .",
    "the summation runs over all considered physical processes .",
    "gravity is neglected [ but will be included in our more detailed calculations ( aksenov et al .",
    "this is a good approximation for the energy injection rates we explore , because @xmath46 ergs  s@xmath2 is the eddington luminosity for the pair plasma , and above it , radiation - pressure forces dominate over gravity .    at the internal boundary , @xmath47 ,",
    "the input pair number flux depends on the temperature @xmath11 at the stellar surface alone , and is taken as ( usov 2001a ) @xmath48               \\nonumber \\\\",

    "their energy spectrum is thermal with temperature @xmath11 , and their angular distribution is isotropic for @xmath50 .",
    "the energy injection rate in @xmath0 pairs is then @xmath51 f_e\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the stellar surface is assumed to be a perfect mirror for both @xmath0 pairs and photons . at the external boundary ( @xmath53 ) , the pairs and photons escape freely from the studied region .",
    "pairs ( @xmath54 ) and photons ( @xmath55 ) as functions of the total luminosity , @xmath4.,width=326 ]    the thermal emission of pairs used in our simulations [ eq .  ( 2 ) ] is that expected in the normal , unpaired , phase of sqm .",
    "however , it has been argued that sqm is a color superconductor with a critical temperature of @xmath56 k ( for a review , see alford , bowers , & rajagopal 2001 ; rajagopal & wilczek 2001 ) .",
    "it is expected that at density much higher than the mean nuclear density , @xmath57 g  @xmath58 , the color superconductor is in the `` color - flavor - locked '' ( cfl ) phase , in which quarks of all three flavors and three colors are paired in a single condensate .",
    "if the density is only slightly higher than @xmath59 , sqm may be in the `` 2 color - flavor superconductor '' ( 2sc ) phase in which only up and down quarks of two colors are paired while the ones of the third color and the strange quarks of all three colors are unpaired . in the cfl phase ,",
    "sqm is electrically neutral and no electrons are present .",
    "so , if at the surface the sqm is in the cfl phase , there is no supercritical electric field and no @xmath0 pair emission . in the 2sc phase ,",
    "electrons are present , and the thermal emission of @xmath0 pairs from the surface is practically the same as for normal sqm .",
    "therefore , our simulations pertain only to the last two cases .",
    "although the injected pair plasma contains no radiation , as the plasma moves outwards , photons are produced by pair annihilation .",
    "other two body processes that we include in our simulations are mller ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) and bhaba ( @xmath62 ) scattering , comptom scattering ( @xmath63 ) , and photon - photon pair production ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "two body processes do not change the total number of particles in a system and thus can not , in themselves , lead to thermal equilibrium .",
    "for this reason , we include bremsstrahlung ( @xmath65 ) , double compton scattering ( @xmath66 ) , and three quantum annihilation ( @xmath67 ) , which change the particle number , even though their cross - sections are @xmath68 times smaller than those of the two body processes ( @xmath69 is the fine - structure constant ) .",
    "we give here the results for the properties of the emerging radiation after stationarity is achieved , so the total wind luminosity is equal to the energy injections rate : @xmath70 .",
    "we present results for different values of @xmath4 , which is the only free parameter .",
    "the corresponding surface temperature @xmath11 is found from equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the luminosity fractions in pairs and photons .",
    "we see that for @xmath71 ergs  s@xmath2 , the emerging emission consists mostly of photons , while @xmath0 pairs dominate for @xmath72 .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that for @xmath72 , the pair - annihilation time is longer than the escape time , and the injected pairs remain mostly intact . at higher luminosities , most pairs annihilate before escape , and reconversion into pairs is inefficient , as the mean energy of photons at the photosphere is rather below the pair - creation threshold .",
    "ergs  s@xmath2 , is the blackbody spectrum with the same energy density as that of the photons at the photosphere of the outflowing wind ( dashed line).,width=326 ]        figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] present the energy spectra of the emerging photons and pairs for different values of @xmath4 . at low luminosities ,",
    "@xmath73 ergs  s@xmath2 , photons that form in annihilation of @xmath0 pairs escape from the vicinity of the strange star more or less freely , and the photon spectra resembles a very wide annihilation line . the small decrease in mean photon energy @xmath74 from @xmath75 kev at @xmath46 ergs  s@xmath2 to @xmath76 kev at @xmath77 ergs  s@xmath2 occurs because of the energy transfer from annihilation photons to @xmath0 pairs via compton scattering ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . as a result of this transfer",
    ", the emerging @xmath0 pairs are heated up to the mean energy @xmath78 kev at @xmath79 ergs  s@xmath2 . for @xmath80 ergs",
    "s@xmath2 , changes in the particle number due to three body processes are essential , and their role in thermalization of the outflowing plasma increases with the increase of @xmath4 .",
    "we see in figure 2 that , for @xmath81 ergs  s@xmath2 , the photon spectrum is near blackbody , except for the presence of a high - energy tail at @xmath82 kev . at this luminosity ,",
    "the mean energy of the emerging photons is @xmath83 kev , while the mean energy of the blackbody photons is @xmath84 kev ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "( the energy resolution in our simulations is @xmath85 kev . )        for @xmath86 ergs  s@xmath2 , the emerging pair energy spectrum is close to a maxwellian , while for @xmath87 ergs  s@xmath2 it deviates significantly from it ( see fig .",
    "we have identified certain characteristics of the expected radiation from hot , bare , strange stars that we hope will help identify such stars , if they exist .",
    "the spectrum , we find , is rather hard for the studied luminosity range .",
    "this makes such stars amenable to detection and study by sensitive , high energy instruments , such as integral ( e.g. , schoenfelder 2001 ) , which is more sensitive in this range than previous detectors .    as super - eddington luminosities and , as we find , hard x - ray spectra characterize the emission from bare , strange stars , soft @xmath88-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , which are the sources of short bursts of hard x - rays with super - eddington luminosities ( up to @xmath89 ) , are reasonable candidates for strange stars ( e.g. , alcock , farhi , & olinto 1986b ; cheng & dai 1998 ; usov 2001b ) .",
    "the bursting activity of sgrs may be explained by fast heating of the stellar surface up to the temperature of @xmath90  k and its subsequent thermal emission ( usov 2001b , c ) .",
    "the heating mechanism may be either impacts of comets onto bare strange stars ( zhang , xu , & qiao 2000 ; usov 2001b ) or fast decay of superstrong ( @xmath91  g ) magnetic fields ( usov 1984 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ; heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) . for typical luminosities of sgrs ( @xmath92 ergs  s@xmath2 ) , the mean photons energy we find is @xmath83 kev ( see fig",
    ".  4 ) , which is consistent with observations of sgrs ( hurley 2000 ) .",
    "another important idiosyncrasy that we find is a strong anti - correlation between spectral hardness and luminosity . while at very high luminosities ( @xmath93 ergs  s@xmath2 ) the spectral temperature increases with luminosity as in blackbody radiation , in the range of luminosities we studied , where thermal equilibrium is not achieved , the expected correlation is opposite ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . such anti - correlations were , indeed , observed for sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 where the burst statistic is high enough ( e.g. , feroci et al . 2001 ; gogus et al .",
    "2001 ; ibrahim et al .",
    "this is encouraging , but a direct comparison of this data with results such as ours will require a more detailed analysis . in particular , the effects of strong magnetic fields have to be included .",
    "the observed periodic variations may be due to a rotation of a star with non - uniform surface temperature , while our result apply for isotropic emission .",
    "we hope to deal with this elsewhere .",
