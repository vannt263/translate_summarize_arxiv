    "_ astrophysicists work on `` important '' , `` big '' problems and think that the basic physics that they require to solve their problems has already been done , or , if it has not been done , it is easy and can be readily produced , as opposed to the hard problems they are working on .",

    "this review is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : nucleosynthesis ] sets the stage with a few basic facts about nucleosynthesis .",
    "section  [ sect : hot ] then illustrates the cross - fertilization between atomic physics and astrophysics on particular examples .",
    "first , we present several astrophysical puzzles which were solved once that more accurate or more complete atomic data became available ( the iron and oxygen abundances in the sun , the lithium abundance in post - agb stars , the galactic age based on the th / nd , th / eu and th / u chronometers , the excitation mechanism of the pulsation in @xmath2 cephei stars , and the meteorology of brown dwarf stars ) .",
    "second , we discuss issues where the advent of new instruments calls for new atomic or molecular data ( the exploration of the 300400  nm ultraviolet window with high - resolution spectrographs , and of the near- and far - infrared windows with the _ iso _ and _ herschel _ satellites ) . in section  [",
    "sect : success ] , we list recent achievements of the atomic - physics community of special importance for astrophysicists ( new oscillator strengths : solar , measured or computed _ ab initio _ ; better partition functions ; new theory for van der waals broadening by neutral hydrogen atoms : the _ damping enhancement factor _ is gone ; 3-d modeling of atmospheric convection : _ microturbulence _ is gone ) .",
    "finally , section  [ sect : databases ] provides starting points to locate existing databases of atomic and molecular data .",
    "the relative abundances of the chemical elements in the solar system have been derived for the first time by russell in 1929 @xcite , from the spectroscopic analysis of the solar photosphere , and by goldschmidt in 1937 @xcite , from the chemical analysis of primitive meteorites known as carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "more recent compilations and revisions of the solar - system abundances were provided by suess & urey in 1956 @xcite , by anders & grevesse in 1989 @xcite and by grevesse & sauval in 1998 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] ) .",
    "the solar - system abundances hold the key to the various nucleosynthesis processes at work in the universe . in a seminal paper ( that has become known as b2fh @xcite ) , burbidge , burbidge , fowler & hoyle proposed in 1957 a small number of distinct nucleosynthesis processes accounting for the major features of the abundance curve .",
    "although nearly fifty years have elapsed , their analysis remains basically correct , as recently reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the various nucleosynthesis processes at work in the universe are the following @xcite : + ( i ) _ cosmological nucleosynthesis_. at the time of the big bang , only the lightest elements were formed , from hydrogen to lithium ; + ( ii ) _ spallation reactions _ in the interstellar medium are still producing lithium , beryllium and boron nowadays ; + ( iii ) _ the cameron - fowler mechanism _ ( @xcite and sect .",
    "[ sect : li ] ) produces lithium under very special circumstances in warm convective zones of late - type giant stars ; + ( iv ) _ the major nuclear - burning stages responsible for the energy generation in stars _ produce helium , as well as the elements from carbon to iron ; + ( v ) _ the nuclear statistical equilibrium _ , established in supernovae of types  i and ii , is responsible for the build - up of the so - called iron peak , extending roughly from ti to zn and involving the elements with the highest binding energies ; + ( vi ) _ the s- , r- and p - processes _ are responsible for the synthesis of nuclides heavier than @xmath3fe , the so - called `` heavy elements '' ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the p - process produces isotopes on the proton - rich side of the valley of @xmath2 stability .",
    "it operates through a chain of photodissociation reactions in the hot environment of some type  ii supernova explosions and will not be discussed here .",
    "the s- and r - processes are neutron - capture processes producing isotopes within the valley of @xmath2 stability or on its neutron - rich side . the s - process ( where _ s _ stands for _ slow _ ) operates in low neutron - density environments associated with helium - burning in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hr ] ; central he - burning in massive stars also contributes to the production of s - process elements between fe and sr ) .",
    "the s - process imprints a very specific signature on the abundance curve in the form of peaks around the so - called `` magic nuclei '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] ) , which have a closed neutron shell ( the analogues of the rare gases which have a closed electronic shell in atomic physics ) .",
    "the first peak involves @xmath5sr , @xmath6y , @xmath7zr , the second involves @xmath8ba , @xmath9la and @xmath10ce whereas the third peak involves @xmath11pb and @xmath12bi .    the r - process ( where _",
    "r _ stands for _ rapid _ ) operates in high neutron - density environments , probably associated with type  ii supernova explosions or with the coalescence of two neutron stars .",
    "it produces abundance peaks which resemble those of the s - process , but which are shifted to the left by about 15 mass units ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] ) .",
    "elements with a large contribution from the r - process include eu , gd , w , re , ir , pt , as well as the actinides th and u.    astrophysical diagnostics of some among these processes will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : hot ] , with special emphasis on the atomic - physics input .",
    "they involve stars at different evolutionary stages , all displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] .",
    "atomic and molecular data are used in astrophysics for two different purposes : ( i ) to compute the opacity of the stellar matter , and hence , to derive the thermal structure of the star and its atmosphere ( i.e. , the run of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 as a function of distance from the center ; see @xcite and the contributions by jrgensen , liebert and scholz & wehrse in @xcite for a discussion of this specific aspect ) , or ( ii ) to predict abundances for specific chemical elements from the equivalent widths of appropriate spectral lines or from spectral synthesis .",
    "abundances are generally derived under the assumption that matter and radiation are locally in equilibrium with each other ( the so - called _ local thermodynamical equilibrium _",
    "hypothesis , denoted lte ) .",
    "this hypothesis does not hold for specific lines under specific stellar conditions ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) .",
    "if abundances must be derived under non - lte conditions , specific inputs will be required from atomic physics .",
    "they will not be discussed here , however .",
    "iron is the prototypical element used to estimate the so - called stellar metallicity [ fe / h ] = @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the fe abundance in the logarithmic scale where @xmath18 , and subscript @xmath19 refers to the solar abundance .",
    "the iron abundance is used as a normalization , where [ x / fe ] @xmath20 element in most stellar abundance works  because it has a wealth of lines in the optical spectra of cool stars  hence its central importance in cosmochemistry . and yet , even in the sun , the situation concerning the fe abundance was very unsatisfactory until just a few years ago , the abundances derived from fe  i lines being often larger than the fe  ii abundance by as much as 0.15  dex . although the solar fe  ii abundance was in agreement with the meteoritic value ( @xmath21 ; @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : fe ] ) , it had uncomfortably large uncertainties approaching 25% @xcite .",
    "the history of the determination of the solar iron abundance over the last century is indeed very shaky , with atomic physics playing a central role , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fe ] shows the evolution of the iron abundances derived over the years starting from its very first measurement by russell in 1929 @xcite .",
    "early determinations resulted in abundances an order of magnitude below the coronal and meteoritic values .",
    "this discrepancy led to a flurry of new astrophysical models aiming at explaining the origin of the iron fractionation between the photosphere and the corona ... until it was discovered in 1969 that this fractionation is in fact spurious and resulted from a systematic error in the absolute scale of the transition probabilities @xcite !",
    "the following milestone was the publication of measured transition probabilities ( @xcite and references therein ) which resulted in a spectacular reduction of the scatter in the early 1980s .",
    "still , in the 1990s , a debate raged about which from the low fe abundance ( @xmath21 ) or high fe abundance ( @xmath22 ) is the correct one ( see also the review in @xcite ) .",
    "the former value , advocated by the kiel - hannover group @xcite , agrees with the meteoritic value @xcite , whereas the latter was defended by the oxford group @xcite .",
    "the origin of this longstanding puzzle has been identified by @xcite as the cumulative effect of slight differences between the equivalent widths , the @xmath23-values denotes oscillator strengths ] absolute scales , the microturbulent velocities and the empirical enhancement factors of the damping constants ( see sect .  [ sect : omara ] ) adopted by the two groups ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the photospheric fe abundance ( @xmath21 ) derived by @xcite is now in perfect agreement with the meteoritic value .    despite the satisfactory situation regarding the solar fe abundance",
    ", it must be stressed that the number of fe ( especially fe  ii ) lines with experimental @xmath23 values remains uncomfortably small . in their evaluation of the solar fe abundance based on the currently best set of atomic data and lines , grevesse & sauval @xcite",
    "use 65 fe  i lines but only 13 fe  ii lines with experimental @xmath23 values ( see also @xcite ) . for fe  ii ,",
    "the situation is especially worrisome since the dispersion of the abundances derived from the various individual fe  ii lines remains quite large ( 0.095  dex ; fig .  7 of @xcite )",
    "the situation may be expected to improve rapidly , though , thanks to the ferrum project ( @xcite ; see sect .",
    "[ sect : loggf ] ) .",
    "oxygen is a very important element for nucleosynthesis : the run of the o / fe ratio with metallicity [ fe / h ] ( sect .",
    "[ sect : fe ] ) provides interesting clues as to their respective production sites , and the lifetimes of these sites in the galaxy .",
    "type  ii supernovae ( originating from massive , short - living stellar progenitors ) are responsible for the production of oxygen at the galactic level , whereas types  i ( originating from low - mass , long - living stellar progenitors ) and ii contribute to fe @xcite .",
    "the iron production has thus started at a later stage of galactic chemical evolution than the oxygen one .",
    "hence [ o / fe ] should increase with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "but the exact shape of the [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation is currently very polemical @xcite .",
    "a first group of astronomers defends a monotonic increase of [ o / fe ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] , whereas a second group prefers an essentially constant [ o / fe ] for old stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath24 .",
    "the solar - system oxygen abundance is not free from debate either .",
    "since oxygen , being too volatile , is not present in its elemental form in meteorites , its solar - system abundance must rely on spectroscopic determinations in the solar photosphere or corona .",
    "there are four different spectroscopic diagnostics available to infer the oxygen abundance in the sun and in cool stars @xcite : ( i ) permitted o  i lines at @xmath25 777  nm ( the oxygen triplet ) , 844.67 , 926.26 and 926.59  nm ; ( ii ) the @xmath26 and @xmath27 [ o i ] doublet ; ( iii ) electronic @xmath28 uv oh lines ; ( iv ) vibration - rotation or pure rotation oh lines in the infrared .    for a long - time , spectroscopists faced , however , the so - called oxygen problem @xcite : the four diagnostics did not yield consistent abundances .",
    "moreover , several determinations of the solar oxygen abundance gave values significantly higher ( by up to 0.2  dex ) than the oxygen abundances in both the local interstellar medium and in the photospheres of hot stars in the solar neighborhood ( @xcite and references therein ) , which typically fall in the range @xmath298.70 .",
    "which diagnostic should one use to determine the oxygen abundance in cool stars and how does one reconcile the different results from the different diagnostics ?    it is now clear that the solution to the `` oxygen problem '' must no longer be looked for on the atomic and molecular physics side , which has made substantial progress in recent years ( as reviewed by @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that : ( i ) the forbidden [ o  i ] @xmath26 line is blended with ni  i @xmath30 @xcite , whose @xmath23-value has recently been measured @xcite , and which represents about 50% of the blend in the sun @xcite ; + ( ii ) the forbidden [ o  i ] @xmath27 line is blended with cn lines @xcite having poorly determined parameters ; + ( iii ) three fine - structure components have recently been discovered for each of the permitted o  i @xmath25 926.26 and 926.59 lines @xcite .",
    "neglecting these fine - structure components would increase the estimated abundance by 0.1  dex !",
    "the almost satisfactory situation reached on the atomic and molecular physics side now makes it clear that the oxygen problem has its roots in unaccounted non - lte effects and in the 1-d rather than 3-d description of convective stellar atmospheres .",
    "using a fully 3-d model of the solar atmosphere , asplund et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also sect .",
    "[ sect:3d ] ) have settled the oxygen problem for the sun ( with an abundance of @xmath31 , after correcting for non - lte effects ) , and it may be hoped that a similar treatment applied to cool stars will remove the existing discrepancies @xcite .",
    "allende prieto et al .",
    "@xcite conclude their review of the oxygen problem by stating that it _ exemplifies the importance of detailed line profiles and accurate wavelength scales in chemical analyses of stars from spectra as well as the need for hydrodynamical model atmospheres in fine analyses of stellar spectra_. more on the second plea will come in sect .",
    "[ sect:3d ] .",
    "this is another exemplifying situation where inadequate atomic data led astrophysicists to build fancy theories to explain a spurious result , namely a high li abundance in a very evolved class of stars know as post - agb stars .    on the agb , stars with initial masses between @xmath10.8 and 8 m@xmath32",
    "reach very large radii ( several hundreds r@xmath32 ) and low effective temperatures ( @xmath33  k ; fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) . they moreover possess a deep convective envelope .",
    "post - agb stars recently left the agb and are about to become white dwarfs ( wds ) , thus they are crossing the hr diagram from right to left .",
    "lithium is a very fragile element .",
    "its most abundant @xmath34li isotope is destroyed by proton - capture reactions at temperatures of a few 10@xmath35  k @xcite . during the first ascent of the giant branch",
    ", the convective envelope deepens into layers devoid of @xmath34li , so that the surface @xmath34li abundance of giant stars drops markedly .",
    "there is however the possibility to produce @xmath34li through the so - called cameron - fowler transport mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is associated with `` hot - bottom burning '' , a situation where the base of the convective agb envelope penetrates in layers hot enough for @xmath36he(@xmath37be to operate .",
    "the freshly produced @xmath34be is then quickly transported to cooler layers where its decay product , @xmath34li , can no longer be destroyed by proton captures ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this process is well documented observationally by the detection of several li - rich agb stars both in our galaxy and in the magellanic clouds ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this hot - bottom process is , however , only expected to be active in intermediate - mass stars with initial masses around 45  m@xmath32 .",
    "the high li abundances that were reported in _ low - mass _ post - agb stars came therefore as a surprise ( @xcite and references therein ) . indeed , several such objects were described to be enhanced in li to such an extent that production of li had to be invoked to explain the derived abundances .",
    "a further anomaly was the fact that the presence of li in these stars was inferred from the famous li resonance doublet at 670.776 and 670.791  nm but , in all stars , the doublet seemed to be shifted redwards by about 0.02  nm compared to the expected position based on other photospheric lines .",
    "motivated by this unexplained shift in the li doublet , reyniers et al .",
    "@xcite investigated an alternative identification of this line .",
    "they were greatly helped in this enterprise by the dream database ( _ database on rare earths at mons university _",
    "@xcite ; see also sect .",
    "[ sect : databases ] ) . as stated in @xcite ,",
    "_ one of the problems dealing with strongly s - process enriched objects is the lack of accurate atomic data of many s - process elements . besides the more general lack of accurate oscillator strengths , even the wavelengths of the transitions of neutral and ionised s - process species are badly known .",
    "the main purpose of the dream database ( ... ) is to provide such an update concerning the radiative properties of rare - earth atoms and ions .",
    "_ these authors soon realized that a ce  ii line at 670.8099  nm was an obvious candidate to replace the `` shifted li line . ''",
    "spectral synthesis of the corresponding region leads to very satisfactory fits to the observed spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reyniers ] ) , which led the authors to conclude @xcite that _ in none of the post - agb objects there is evidence for in situ li production and there is no need to invoke special non - standard mixing during the agb evolution to explain the claimed high abundances of the fragile element in these stars .",
    "( ... ) this result dramatically illustrates the importance of reliable and complete line lists when doing analyses of these ( ... ) objects ( ... ) . _      the _ goddard high - resolution spectrograph _ @xcite on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( until 1997 ) , the _ ultraviolet - visible echelle spectrograph _ ( uves ) on the _ very large telescope _",
    "@xcite , _ hires _ on keck  i @xcite , the _ high dispersion spectrograph _ on _ subaru _",
    "@xcite opened up the uv spectral window to high - resolution spectral studies .",
    "two classes of stars benefited from this new instrumentation : cool , metal - poor stars enriched in heavy elements ( @xmath4 ) and warm , main - sequence chemically - peculiar ( cp ) stars , since they are ideal candidates for exploring the wealth of heavy - element lines present in the ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "chemically - peculiar stars correspond to main - sequence stars of spectral types b , a ( denoted bp , ap , hgmn or am stars ) .",
    "the chemical peculiarities that they display are not shaped by specific nucleosynthesis processes , but rather by physical processes operating in the hydrodynamically stable atmospheres of these upper main - sequence , slowly - rotating stars .",
    "the atomic properties play a central role in these processes , since the chemical fractionation occurring in these atmospheres is governed by the competing effects of radiatively - driven diffusion and gravitational settling @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields also play a role in some cases .",
    "these processes lead to abundance anomalies , both depletions and enhancements , some of enormous magnitude ( up to factors of @xmath38 ) relative to normal stellar abundances , spanning essentially the entire periodic table ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chilupi ] ) .",
    "the challenge here is twofold : ( i ) realistic calculations of radiatively driven diffusion require , besides sophisticated stellar model atmospheres , a large database of atomic data covering many ionization states of a particular element , and ( ii ) deriving abundances from observed spectra to compare with model predictions requires accurate atomic data for specific lines .",
    "the problem has been perfectly summarized in @xcite : _ the published database of energy levels , classified transitions , wavelengths , oscillator strengths , and nuclear effects ( hyperfine structure and isotope shifts ) in existence before the launch of the ghrs in 1990 was badly deficient in its coverage and accuracy to allow interpretation of the exquisitely detailed uv spectra of cp stars .",
    "the existence of the ghrs observations of @xmath39  lupi is now widely cited by atomic physicists as a `` standard spectroscopic light source , '' because its uv spectrum displays transitions of so many rare elements and also transitions of common elements ( e.g. , fe  ii ) , which are difficult to observe in absorption in the laboratory .",
    "the large database of atomic parameters [ from kurucz @xcite ] provides the essential starting point for the synthesis of complex spectra .",
    "but the active participation of atomic physicists in providing new , highly accurate measurements or calculations for the plethora of ions observed in the @xmath39  lupi spectrum has been indispensable .",
    "the synergy between atomic physics and astrophysics in this investigation has led to new insights in both fields _ ( @xcite to quote only a few ) .",
    "the detailed comparison between observed and predicted abundances of the kind performed in @xcite allows one to check whether radiatively driven diffusion and gravitational settling adequately account for the entire range of phenomena displayed in cp stars .",
    "some systematics emerges @xcite : the occurrence of large abundance anomalies is limited to elements whose initial abundance ( in the prestellar nebula ) was low ( @xmath40 ) , a simple result of saturation in the absorption of radiative momentum .",
    "moreover , clear trends are observed for homologous elements ( belonging to the same column in the periodic table ) , in the expected way . but",
    "puzzles arise as well : one is how  or whether  the above physical processes can account for the isotopic anomalies observed in platinum , mercury and thallium in @xmath39  lupi for example @xcite .",
    "the near ultraviolet region ( down to 360  nm ) of cool , metal - poor stars has been explored in @xcite , reporting the first detection in low - metallicity stars of lines ( see @xcite for a detailed list ) from `` exotic '' elements [ like terbium ( tb , @xmath41 ) , holmium ( ho , @xmath42 ) , thulium ( tm , @xmath43 ) , hafnium ( hf , @xmath44 ) , osmium ( os , @xmath45 ) , platinum ( pt , @xmath46 ) ] of special interest as tracers of r - process nucleosynthesis ( the s - process will be addressed in sect .  [",
    "sect : lead ] ) .",
    "the observations @xcite of metal - poor stars with the various high - resolution uv - visible spectrographs listed above led to the identification of several low - metallicity stars ( cs  22892052 , cs  31082001 , hd  115444 , hd  126238 ) where the distribution of abundances for the heavy elements ( @xmath47 ) is similar to the solar - system r - process abundance pattern ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cowan ] ) .",
    "these observations very clearly demonstrate ( i ) that the r - process abundance pattern seems to be `` universal '' , and ( ii ) that the r - process was already operating very early in the lifetime of the galaxy , before these very old , metal - poor stars formed .",
    "the latter conclusion also supports theory , which predicts that the short - living massive stars are the site of operation of the r - process at the time of their type  ii supernova explosion ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    even for metallicities as low as [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath48 , the ultraviolet spectrum of cool stars is packed with lines , and their correct identification is quite challenging . here",
    "again , the availability of extensive line lists like kurucz s @xcite proved to be of considerable interest , as stressed in @xcite , but these authors warn that _ certainly there also must be ( ... ) transitions [ from heavy elements ] lurking in the [ stellar ] spectrum that simply have yet to be identified in the laboratory _ @xcite .    experimental transition probabilities for `` exotic '' elements like those listed above",
    "were very sparse , and the analyses of heavy - element - rich metal - poor stars sparkled specific laboratory and theoretical studies performed by the lund , wisconsin and mons - lige teams ( sect .  [ sect : loggf ] ) .",
    "clear signatures from the operation of the s - process at low metallicities have been observed in the so - called lead stars @xcite .",
    "these low - metallicity stars exhibit overabundances of s - process elements along with large [ pb / heavy - s ] ratios ( where heavy - s denotes any of the elements belonging to the second s - process peak ) . the very specific abundance pattern observed in lead stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lead ] ) agrees with predictions for the operation of the s - process at low metallicities @xcite .",
    "not all low - metallicity , s - process - rich stars are lead stars , however @xcite , and the origin of this variety , not predicted by the models , is still a mystery .",
    "solving this puzzle will undoubtedly represent an important step towards the understanding of the operation of the s - process in stars .",
    "the situation on the front of atomic and molecular physics is not free from problems either .",
    "the pb abundance has so far been derived from the pb  i lines at @xmath25368.34 and @xmath25405.781  nm @xcite .",
    "accurate , laboratory oscillator strengths for these lines have been derived by @xcite .",
    "the major concern comes rather from the forest of cn lines in which the pb  i @xmath25405.781  nm line is embedded when the star is carbon - rich .",
    "there is currently no entirely satisfactory line list available for the violet cn system .",
    "the situation is made even more critical by the fact that the cn lines in the region of the pb @xmath25405.781  nm line involve very large @xmath49 values ( @xmath50 in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 branches of the @xmath53 system ) , where models become generally less reliable .",
    "[ fig : cn ] reveals that the situation is far from being satisfactory when attempting spectral syntheses in cool carbon stars .",
    "the cn lines are also badly mutilating the spectral window where the u and th lines ( u  ii @xmath54  nm and th  ii @xmath55  nm ) used for cosmochronology ( sect .  [",
    "sect : oldest_stars ] ) are located .",
    "gustafsson @xcite therefore writes : _ systematic efforts in molecular and atomic physics to trace and measure [ the blending ] features in the u and th line regions are of great [ astrophysical ] significance .",
    "_      the so - called r - process of nucleosynthesis @xcite ( see also sect .  [ sect : r ] ) is held responsible for the production of the actinides , among which th and u. the first use of the radioactive decay of @xmath56th ( @xmath57  y ) as a chronometer has been attempted by @xcite .",
    "the stellar age is obtained by comparing the observed th / eu ( or th / nd ) ratio with the predicted value at the stellar birth , the difference being due to the radioactive decay of th . this predicted value relies on both the theoretical production ratio at the nucleosynthesis ( r - process ) site and on the chemical evolution of the galaxy which controls the rate at which the r - process nuclides are injected in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "both ingredients are highly uncertain .",
    "the injection rate in the ism may be a strong function of time , depending upon the star formation rate and the lifetime of the stellar r - process sites .",
    "on the other hand , the stellar yields predicted by the r - process are also quite uncertain , since the description of the r - process suffers from very many astrophysics and nuclear physics problems @xcite .",
    "the physical conditions at the r - process site are badly known ( as is the site itself ! ) , as are the nuclear properties ( e.g. , masses , @xmath2-decay and electronic - capture rates ) for the neutron - rich isotopes involved in the r - process and located far from the valley of @xmath2-stability @xcite .",
    "moreover , the more widely separated the elements are in the periodic table , the more difficult it is to provide reliable relative stellar yields from the r - process @xcite .",
    "a chronometer much more robust than th / eu or th / nd is therefore obtained by considering the pair @xmath56th and @xmath58u , since both nuclides are exclusively produced by the r - process and their proximity in the periodic table makes their predicted yields much more reliable .",
    "this chronometer has been applied by @xcite for the first time to the r - process - rich , metal - poor star cs  31082 - 001 , thanks to the detection of the u  ii @xmath59  nm line .",
    "these authors ( see also @xcite for a detailed description of the principles of nucleo - cosmochronology ) have shown that the ratio @xmath60 in the star at the time of the solar - system birth ( which is easily derived from the observed ratio and the age of the solar system , 4.6  gyr ) can be expressed in terms of the same ratio @xmath61 in the solar system at its birth : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the time elapsed between the birth of the star and that of the solar system , and @xmath64 describes the common injection rate of th and u in the ism by the r - process production sites",
    ". this function encapsulates all our ignorance about these sites and their evolution in the galaxy .",
    "once @xmath63 has been derived , the production ratio at the r - process site , ( th / u)@xmath65 , may be derived from the relation : @xmath66 expressing that u and th have decayed over the time separating the star birth from the solar system birth .",
    "equation  [ eq : th1 ] is especially interesting , since it makes it possible to derive @xmath63 independently of any assumption of the r - process yields ( th / u)@xmath65 . depending on the assumption made for @xmath64 , cayrel et al .",

    "[ eq : th1 ] ) and to the r - process yields , there are problems on the atomic physics side as well ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , two lines are blending the th  ii @xmath67  nm line : a co  i line at @xmath68  nm @xcite and a v  i line at @xmath69  nm @xcite , not recognized in butcher s pioneering work on the th / nd chronometer @xcite .",
    "the co  i line is more sensitive to temperature than the th  ii line , so that its contribution to the blend will change with different stars . with the co  i line taken into account @xcite , ages for the galactic halo on the order of 1520 gyr are obtained , as compared to @xmath70  gyr as initially estimated by butcher @xcite .",
    "the latter age is in blatant contradiction with the large body of evidence for an older galaxy . in yet another re - analysis by @xcite , the hyperfine structure of the co",

    "thus , once again , what once appeared to be an astrophysical puzzle vanishes when using the best available atomic and molecular data .    yet , the re - analysis by morell et al .",
    "@xcite does not constitute the end of this saga .",

    "the last word came from @xcite who measured @xmath71 , about five times larger than the value of @xmath72 from kurucz .",

    "these extensive data on the blending lines , plus the recent measurement of the oscillator strengths of the th  ii @xmath76  nm and u  ii @xmath59  nm lines @xcite , should reduce the uncertainty sources from atomic physics to a minimum .",

    "the problem of the pulsation mechanism of @xmath2 cephei stars remained unsolved for more than 30 years , and its solution @xcite came from atomic physics .",
    "it thus provides yet another illustration of the cross - fertilization between this discipline and astrophysics .",
    "the variable stars of @xmath2 cephei type are a group of early b stars which exhibit short - period variations of brightness , radial velocity and line profile @xcite .",
    "these variations are clearly due to pulsations , with periods ranging from about two to seven hours .",
    "but the excitation mechanism of these pulsations remained elusive .",
    "this excitation mechanism must feed as much pulsational energy to the star from its total energy supply as is lost through damping during pulsation .",
    "a very effective excitation mechanism is the so - called @xmath82-mechanism @xcite , which relies on the fact that certain layers of the stars may become opaque at the time of maximum compression .",
    "if this happens , the radiative energy becomes `` dammed up '' inside , causing the star to expand again after compression , and thus acting to drive the pulsations . to be operative",

    "that mechanism can not , however , be effective in the much hotter @xmath2  cepheid stars @xcite .",
    "the opal opacities @xcite provided the solution to this puzzle by revealing an `` opacity bump '' due to the sudden appearance of a tremendous number of iron lines as the temperature rises above @xmath85  k. this opacity bump is responsible for the operation of the @xmath82-mechanism in @xmath2  cepheid variables @xcite . it should be stressed that this sharp increase in opacity was found only after the spin - orbit interactions were properly included in the opal calculations @xcite .",
    "the crop of extremely cool stars and substellar objects has been meager until very recently , when marked improvements in detection ability have finally started to yield a rich harvest @xcite .",
    "these very low - mass and very cool main sequence stars extend from the usual class of m dwarfs ( @xmath86  k ) to brown dwarfs of newly - defined spectral classes  l and t. class  l ( @xmath87  k ) is defined by the absence of tio and vo bands in the visible spectrum , which is dominated instead by bands of metal hydrides like feh , crh and mgh .",
    "class  t ( @xmath88(k ) ) corresponds to the appearance of ch@xmath89 bands in the spectrum .",

    "m dwarfs span a mass range from 0.5  m@xmath32  ( m0 , or @xmath90  k ) down to the limit of 0.075  m@xmath32  ( m10 , or @xmath91  k ) corresponding to the lowest stellar mass which can sustain hydrogen burning . below this limit and down to 0.013  m@xmath32 ,",
    "deuterium - burning is operating , and defines the brown - dwarf regime .",
    "below @xmath92  k , complex o - rich compounds condense in the atmosphere ( corundum @xmath93 , enstatite @xmath94 , forsterite @xmath95 , perovskite @xmath96 etc . ) and may form dust clouds at different heights in the atmosphere depending on their precise condensation temperature .",
    "advances in the atmospheric modeling of very cool stars have been slowed by the twin bottlenecks of ( i ) incomplete molecular opacity databases ( especially for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and caoh @xcite , the latter having several strong bands in the visible spectrum ) and ( ii ) the inability to handle convection rigorously ( but see sect .  [ sect:3d ] for a description of recent progresses in this field ) .",
    "once these problems are addressed reasonably well , we still face other challenges : incorporating the effects of photospheric grain formation , chromospheres , magnetic fields , departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium , spatial variations in atmospheric structure due to starspots , and cloud formation .",
    "grains play a very important role in these atmospheres , and possibly lead to weather patterns ( grains are raining ! ) .",

    "kurucz @xcite has stressed that only about half the lines of the solar spectrum are correctly identified .",

    "the availability of tunable lasers and fourier transform spectrometers , coupled to the astrophysical impetus imparted by some of the hot topics mentioned in sect .",

    "the van der waals broadening due to atomic collisions with neutral hydrogen is the dominant source of line broadening in cool - star atmospheres . for decades , the only available model of collisional",
    "damping of atomic lines was encapsulated in the unsld formula @xcite , strictly valid for hydrogenic atoms collisioning with neutral hydrogen . for non - hydrogenic atoms ,",
    "this treatment yields damping constants that are too small ( by factors 210 ) , so that a `` fudge - factor '' or `` damping enhancement factor '' was applied to the unsld formula to estimate the damping constant .",

    "spectroscopic parameter , the microturbulent velocity , is about to disappear as well ! ) .",
    "the availability of this theory of collisional broadening makes it thus possible to use the wings of very strong lines as abundance indicators , a very unusual approach thus far , but which offers the big advantage that accurate oscillator strengths are generally available for such lines .",
    "an illustration of this approach is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : grevesse ] , which displays spectral syntheses of the mg  i @xmath25518.3  nm line in the sun , with the unsld model and with the new one .",

    "the atmospheres of stars of solar and later types are convective ( as revealed in the case of the sun by its surface granulation ) .",
    "the accompanying matter motions broaden the spectral lines . in one - dimensional ( 1-d ) analyses of stellar atmospheres , two _",
    "ad hoc _ parameters are introduced to account for this line broadening , namely the micro- and macroturbulence @xcite .",
    "they are intended to describe the line broadening associated with mass motions on length scales less than and larger than a unit optical depth , respectively .",
    "such a simplistic division is clearly artificial since the motions occur on a range of scales .",
    "almost all abundances for late - type stars derived so far have been obtained in this framework , which has clear shortcomings , like its inability to reproduce the observed asymmetric line shapes ( solid line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fe-3d ] , to be compared with the diamonds representing the line profile obtained with 1-d modeling ) .",
    "with the advent of supercomputers , self - consistent , three - dimensional , radiative - hydrodynamical simulations of the convective atmosphere of solar- and late - type stars have become feasible ( @xcite , and , more recently @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations achieve a spectacular agreement between the observed and computed line shapes in the sun , especially in terms of asymmetries and absolute velocity shifts ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fe-3d ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig : bisector ] ) .",
    "such a detailed agreement ensures that these simulations reproduce the details of the velocity field , both in terms of depth and surface structure ( i.e. , granulation ) .",
    "these simulations also enlighten the inadequacy of the micro- and macroturbulence parameters , by showing the complexity and variety of line shapes at different locations over the solar surface ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fe-3d ] ) .    in the framework of this review , it is of interest to stress that the predictions of absolute line shifts ( due to the unequal surfaces covered by upward and downward convective motions on the solar surface ) are of such good a quality ( fig .  [ fig : bisector ] ) that they could even detect erroneous laboratory wavelengths ( by less than 20  m ) for some fe  i lines @xcite .",
    "the 3-d simulations of the kind described above @xcite are of importance not only for deriving correct abundances in the sun and late - type stars ( see the discussions relative to iron and oxygen abundances in sects .  [",
    "sect : fe ] and [ sect : o ] @xcite ) , but also in the search for extra - solar planets , which requires to correctly assess the intrinsic radial - velocity jitter .",
    "the methods described above were so far mostly applied to solar - like stars , and not so much to red giant stars . in these stars where the convective cells are of much larger size @xcite , the differences with respect to 1-d models are expected to be even more dramatic , as the averaging over the stellar surface will not attenuate the effect of the asymmetries as it does with the solar granulation .",
    "spectacular animations showing these asymmetries at the surface of a supergiant like betelgeuse ( @xmath101  orionis ) were produced by b.  freytag ( http://www.astro.uu.se/@xmath1bf/movie/movie.html ) . in the near future , simulations predicting spectral line shapes for giant and supergiant stars will certainly become available .",
    "we might well face unpleasant surprises when the time comes to compare abundances derived in the framework of such 3-d models with the ones obtained with 1-d model atmospheres .",
