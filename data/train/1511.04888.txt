    "<S> we explore the electron neutrino signals from light dark matter ( dm ) annihilation in the sun for the large liquid scintillator detector juno . in terms of the spectrum features of three typical dm annihilation channels </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 , we take two sets of selection conditions to calculate the expected signals and atmospheric neutrino backgrounds based on the monte carlo simulation data . then the juno sensitivities to the spin independent dm - nucleon and spin dependent dm - proton cross sections are presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the juno projected sensitivities are much better than the current spin dependent direct detection experimental limits for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels . in the spin independent case </S>",
    "<S> , the juno will give the better sensitivity to the dm - nucleon cross section than the lux and cdmslite limits for the @xmath1 channel with the dm mass lighter than 6.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath3 or @xmath2 channel is dominant , the future juno results are very helpful for us to understand the tension between the dama annual modulation signal and other direct detection exclusions . </S>"
