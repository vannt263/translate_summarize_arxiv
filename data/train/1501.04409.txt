    "to the increased axial coverage of multi - slice computed tomography ( ct ) and the introduction of flat - panel detector , the size of x - ray illumination fields has grown dramatically , causing an increase in scatter radiation . for most of cases ,",
    "artifacts are present when the model used in the reconstruction algorithm is not consistent with the projection data acquisition model .",
    "existing reconstruction algorithms do nt model the scatter radiation , so scatter artifacts appear in the ct images .",
    "typical scatter artifacts show as shading , streaks between high contrast objects , reduced contrast resolution and inaccurate hounsfield units ( hu ) numbers .",
    "scatter correction has been extensively studied in the past serval decades but a clinically sensible solution remains illusive .",
    "current scatter correction methods can be roughly classified into five approaches : physical scatter rejection , analytical modeling , monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , primary modulation and scatter measurements  @xcite .    to develop a scatter artifacts correction method that is fast , accurate , and ,",
    "ideally , has no need for extra scans , extra measurements or extra hardware support or modifications is the goal of this study .",
    "we provide a fast and accurate scatter artifacts correction method for cone beam ct ( cbct ) imaging . in the proposed method ,",
    "the difference between the measured raw projection data and a polychromatic reprojection of a segmented image volume is used to generate a coarse estimate of scatter profile .",
    "based on the coarse scatter estimation , a denoising algorithm specifically designed for poisson signal which employs a total variation regularization term was then applied to yield the final scatter estimation . by simply subtracting the final scatter estimate from the raw projection data ,",
    "we can obtain the corrected projection data . the corrected image",
    "was then reconstructed using the corrected projection data .",
    "mc simulations , experimental phantom data and _ in vivo _ human data were used to validate and evaluate the proposed scatter correction method .",
    "the measured raw projection data can be modeled as the summation of the primary and scatter signals .",
    "a general scatter artifact correction strategy is to estimate the scattered radiation distribution and then subtract it from the measured raw projection data , i.e. @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the corrected projection data , namely , the estimated primary projection data , @xmath2 is the raw data and @xmath3 is the scatter signal .",
    "indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for projection view angle and detector channel number respectively . for simplicity , we will drop the index @xmath5 in the following discussions .      the proposed method , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , starts with an image segmentation of the scatter artifacts contaminated cbct image volume , followed by a polychromatic reprojection of the segmented image volume using a given x - ray spectrum and known data acquisition geometry .",
    "the reprojected data is then subtracted from the measured raw projection data at each given view angle to generate a coarse estimate of the necessary scatter profile used for denoising algorithm .        based on the segmented image volume",
    ", the primary signal can be modeled as follows : @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the total number of photons , @xmath8 is the polychromatic x - ray spectrum , @xmath9 is the energy - dependent efficiency of the detector , which is simply considered as proportional to photon energy @xmath10 because most ct scanners use energy - integrating detectors .",
    "@xmath11 is the maximum photon energy of the spectrum .",
    "@xmath12 is the energy - dependent linear attenuation coefficient and @xmath13 is the propagation path length for each ray , and can be calculated using a gpu - based ray - tracing algorithm  @xcite . by using these notations , the flood field @xmath14 can be modeled as follows : @xmath15 after replacing @xmath7 with @xmath14 and substituting it into  ( [ equ : reporjection ] ) , the result describes the estimated primary signal with flood field @xmath14 : @xmath16}{\\int_{0}^{e_{max}}\\mathrm{d}e\\,\\omega(e)\\,\\eta(e)}.\\ ] ] subtracting the above estimated primary signal from the measured total projection data @xmath2 , the coarse scatter signal @xmath17 can be estimated as follows : @xmath18}{\\int_{0}^{e_{max}}\\mathrm{d}e\\,\\omega(e)\\,\\eta(e)}.\\ ] ] note that the segmented image volume is generated from a scatter contaminated reconstruction and the polychromatic x - ray spectrum used in the reprojection can be recovered using an indirect transmission measurement - based spectrum estimation method  @xcite .",
    "since the coarse scatter estimate @xmath17 is highly dependent on the segmentation procedure , it may yield inaccurate results , especially for low contrast objects that have similar attenuation properties as the background and for the edges of two neighboring materials . to compensate for the inaccuracy caused by the inaccurate segmentation , instead of regularizing the coarse scatter using a convolution - based scatter model  @xcite , in this study , we directly denoise the coarse scatter estimate using a statistical - based denoising algorithm .",
    "as we know , scatter radiation distribution is typically predominantly of low frequency content not only in spatial domain but also in temporal domain .",
    "a denoising technique specifically designed for poisson signal was applied to @xmath17 to yield a smooth scatter distribution  @xcite .",
    "the denoising algorithm which is based on the total - variation regularization is aimed to solve the following optimization problem , @xmath19 the first term of  ( [ equ : energyfunction ] ) is a data - fidelity term that is designed specifically for poisson statistical signal and keep @xmath3 close to the data @xmath17 , while the second term is a total - variation regularization term to keep the solution @xmath3 smooth , namely , being dominated with low frequency content .",
    "@xmath20 is a constant to determine the relative importance of the two terms .",
    "this objective function is convex and can be solved using an variational approach  @xcite .",
    "it has to note that the proposed method can also be implemented in image - domain .",
    "for those cases when we only have images or volume , we need to estimate scatter artifact error images which can be added directly to the uncorrected images .",
    "to achieve this goal , a scatter projection error @xmath21 which can be added linearly in the logarithmic raw - data domain can be calculated . because the tomographic reconstruction is a linear process and the order of summation and backprojection operations are interchangeable .      to validate the proposed algorithm ,",
    "an anthropomorphic thorax phantom and an abdomen phantom were used to generate mc simulation data with a geant4-based mc simulation package gate  @xcite . to quantitatively and qualitatively",
    "investigate the effect of scatter artifacts reduction , both of the phantoms include a water insert at the central area and the water insert has three small low contrast inserts ( adipose , breast and liver ) and a bone insert .",
    "primary projection data , scatter only projection data , and primary plus scatter projection data were extracted independently . for a faster simulation , a parallel geometry and a plane x - ray source ( 2d @xmath22  mm@xmath23 rectangle source ) were used in the mc simulation .",
    "the distance from the source to the center of rotation is 750 mm and the distance from the detector to center of rotation is 450 mm .",
    "a circular scan was simulated and a total of 360 projections per rotation are acquired over an angular range of @xmath24 .",
    "the polychromatic x - ray source spectrum is 125 kvp and it is generated using spektr software  @xcite with 5 mm aluminum filtration .",
    "for each of the simulations , a total number of @xmath25 photons were emitted .    in a first experiment , we investigate scatter correction for the anthropomorphic thorax phantom and abdomen phantom in both projection domain and image domain .",
    "the primary image was used as reference images and the total images were applied to the proposed scatter correction algorithm . to test the robustness of method with respect to the segmentation , two components ( lung and tissue ) , three components ( lung , tissue and bone ) and four components ( lung , water , tissue and bone ) segmentation were performed based on the uncorrected thorax phantom images respectively .",
    "the proposed algorithm was also evaluated using experimental data of a catphan500 phantom ( the phantom laboratory , salem , ny ) scanned using a cbct on - board imager ( varian 2100ex system , varian medical systems , palo alto , ca ) .",
    "a total of 678 projections were evenly acquired in a 360 degree rotation with @xmath26 binning .",
    "both wide collimation and narrow collimation modes were applied with the same scan parameters .",
    "a set of _ in vivo _ pelvis data was also used to evaluate the proposed method .",
    "this data was acquired in half - fan mode using state - of - the - art of the kv cbct imaging system of the varian truebeam system(varian medical systems , palo alto , usa ) .",
    "the tube potential was set to 125 kvp and 678 projections were acquired on a flat - panel detector ( varian 4030cb imager ) with 1024 columns and 768 rows .",

    "it took about 1 min to correct a typical varian clinical dataset ( @xmath28 ) using a nvidia geforce gtx  480 card .",
    "it has to note that the selection of the denoising parameters depends on segmented image . since the noise level of the mc simulation data is very high , a relatively large @xmath29 and @xmath20 ( compared to the patient data )",
    "were used to smooth the segmentation error and to yield a denoised scatter that fit the true scatter well enough . to our belief ,",
    "most of the clinical images have much lower noise level and the segmented images would be superior to the segmented images of the mc data in this study .",
    "nevertheless , a larger @xmath29 and @xmath20 are recommended for badly segmented images to reinforce regularization . in summary , this work presents a novel strategy to estimate a coarse scattered radiation profile , based on which a denoising algorithm was applied to yield the final scatter estimation .",
    "we demonstrated that a significant increase in image uniformity and hu accuracy were achieved after correction .",
    "the correction algorithm requires minimum computational cost , requires no modifications to existing system hardware , and can also handle cross - scatter for dual source dual energy ct scanner .",
    "furthermore , the method can also be applied to spiral cone - beam ct where the anti - scatter grid can be uninstalled to further reduce radiation dose .",
    "the authors would like to thank drs jennifer smilowitz , guanghong chen , ke li and stephen  brunner for providing the experimental data .",
    "the authors are also grateful to dr lei xing for his careful reading of the manuscript and his useful comments ."
