    "this psf - based technique allows us to ( i ) increase the number of analysable objects in the field , ( ii ) estimate an unbiased flux for a given source , ( iii ) extract the light curve ( lc ) of a star in a crowded environment and ( iv ) improve the photometric precision reachable for faint stars ( @xmath1 .    in this work",
    ", we continue our effort on stellar clusters , focusing on the open cluster ( oc ) praesepe ( ngc  2632 , hereafter simply m44 ) that was observed between 2015 april 27 and 2015 july 10 during the _",

    "we applied our psf - based approach described in to extract the lcs of the stars imaged on the isolated target - pixel files ( tpfs ) of module 14 , where most of the cluster stars are observed . although m44 is sparser than the field studied in and not in a super - stamp , our technique is perfectly suitable to also analyse this cluster .",

    "two hot jupiters were found by @xcite , each of them around a m44 main - sequence ( ms ) star .",
    "later , in a long - term rv monitoring of m44 members , @xcite found an additional , massive jupiter in a very - eccentric orbit hosted by one of the two aforementioned ms stars , discovering de facto the first multi - planet system in an oc . from the photometric point of view , before _",

    "k2_/c5 data to search for additional ( transiting ) exoplanets hosted by m44 members , taking advantage of the high - precision photometry and the almost - uninterrupted time series released by _ k2_.",
    "as in , we used a high - angular - resolution input list to perform our neighbour - subtraction technique .",
    "we observed m44 in seven nights ( between 2015 march 27 and april 22 ) using the asiago 67/92 cm schmidt telescope on mount ekar .",

    ", we created a set of 9@xmath25 spatially - varying , empirical psfs and used them to measure positions and fluxes for all the detectable objects in the field .",
    "the dedicated software was developed starting from the work of @xcite with the wide - field imager at the 2.2 m mpi / eso telescope .",
    "stellar positions were also corrected for geometric distortion .",
    "the input catalogue was built as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "briefly , we started by making the @xmath5-filter input list .",
    "we transformed ( by mean of six - parameter linear transformations ) all @xmath5-filter stellar catalogues into the reference frame system of the best ( minimum of the product between airmass and seeing ) image .",
    "we then created a stacked image which high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) allowed us to better analyse faint sources .",
    "as for the single exposures , we generated an array of spatially - varying , empirical psfs and measured all detectable objects over the entire fov covered by the stacked image .",
    "spurious detections and psf artefacts were removed from the input list by using a parameter called quality of the psf fit ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the method described in @xcite and by visually inspecting the stacked image .    the same procedure was performed to obtain the stellar list for the other filters .",
    "the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 magnitudes were calibrated by using the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "we selected a sample of bright , unsaturated stars in our catalogue in common with that of @xcite , and performed a least - square fit to find the coefficients of the calibration equations .",
    "we found that a linear relation was enough to register our photometry .",
    "finally we cross - identified all stars among the different catalogues and create a multi - filter input list for m44 .",
    "the catalogue , that contains about 24000 stars measured in @xmath5 filter , was also linked to the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",

    "hereafter we refer to this catalogue as the asiago input catalogue ( aic ) .",
    "k2_/c5 data set was reduced following the prescriptions given in .",
    "we analysed the entire module 14 in which m44 is mainly imaged , namely channels 45 , 46 , 47 and 48 . for each channel",

    "was used to assign the pixel values .    to model the undersampled psf of each _",
    "kepler_channel , we used again the effective - psf ( epsf ) formalism of @xcite .",
    "the epsfs were mainly modelled following the prescriptions given in . here",
    "we describe only the differences between the two works .",
    "first , we used the aic , transformed into the reference frame system of each image , to pinpoint the position of the bright , unsaturated stars selected to model the epsf .",
    "the high angular resolution and the astrometric accuracy of the aic allowed us to better place the epsf samplings and overcome the most of the pixel - phase errors .",
    "three ( out of four ) module-14 channels are not completely covered by the aic ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . however , since our aim was to obtain a reliable , average epsf model for each channel , this partial coverage was a good compromise to deal with .",
    "second , we introduced a neighbour - subtraction stage during the ( iterative ) epsf - modelling process . before collecting the epsf samplings from a given star and model the epsf , we subtracted ( by using the current epsf model ) all its close - by neighbours contained in the aic in order to decrease the light - contamination effects that would result in a shallower epsf . a more detailed description of the new method will be published in a subsequent paper of this series focused on the globular cluster m4 observed during _",
    "k2_campaign 2 ( libralato et al . , in preparation ) , in which the improvement using this approach is more evident due to the higher level of crowding with respect to m44 .",
    "once we converged to an average epsf model for each channel , we perturbed it for each image to take into account the temporal variation .",
    "we performed a 2@xmath22 perturbation that also partially solved for the epsf spatial variations across the channel fov .",
    "the 2@xmath22 array was chosen as a compromise between modelling the spatial variations of the epsf and having enough stars to model the epsf itself in each cell .",
    "we also introduced a neighbour - subtraction phase at the epsf - perturbation stage , using the aic to find the location of the close - by neighbours to subtract , before tabulating the normalised epsf residuals .",
    "for the regions not covered by the aic we just collected the epsf residuals subtracting only the most obvious neighbour stars clearly visible in the reconstructed _ k2_exposures .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , as stated in , our epsfs are still not perfect and a non - negligible room for improvements is expected when the pixel - response - function calibration data will be publicly available .    finally , we measured positions and fluxes of all sources in each _",
    "k2_reconstructed full - frame exposure with a least - square fit of the epsf .",
    "we then made a common reference frame system ( master frame ) for each channel by cross - identifying all bright , unsaturated stars from each _ k2_image .",
    "position and flux of a given star in the master frame were iteratively computed as the clipped average of the positions and fluxes of that star as measured in each _ k2_exposure and transformed with six - parameter linear transformations and zero - point registration into the master - frame reference system .",
    "we extracted the lcs for most of the objects imaged on module-14 tpfs during _ k2_/c5 .",
    "hereafter , we discuss the key ingredients of our method .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the aic does not completely cover the entire module-14 fov , leaving part of channels 45 , 46 and 48 partially unexplored .",
    "for this reason , we chose to add the most of the missing stars to the aic using the _ k2_images themselves , extracting position and flux of these objects as described in sect .",
    "[ k2data ] .",
    "different factors ( e.g. , photometric zero - points and geometric distortion ) may vary across such a large fov , therefore we performed the procedure described below independently for each channel .    first , we transformed the position of each missing star from a given _ k2_exposure ( reconstructed using all tpfs with cadence number 108564 ) into that of the aic by using six - parameter linear transformations and added them to the input catalogue .",
    "the positions of the added stars are less precise than those of the stars contained in the original aic .",
    "furthermore , for these added stars we do not have any control about the light - dilution effects .",
    "however , in this way we were able to add , on average , about 130 stars to each channel input list .",
    "then , we registered the aic @xmath5-filter magnitudes into the @xmath14-magnitude system of the previously - built _ k2_master frame . in first approximation ,",
    "the asiago schmidt @xmath5 filter is rather similar to the _",
    "kepler_total transmission curve , and in we used a simple zero - point to transform the aic white - light magnitudes into @xmath14magnitudes . however , m44 stars are spread over a wide range of colours in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , i.e. , @xmath15 magnitudes from the upper to the lower ms , and we found that such zero - point was not the same for all colours .",
    "therefore , we performed a photometric calibration by using the ( @xmath16 ) colour to transform the @xmath5-filter measurements into @xmath14magnitudes .",
    "we applied a least - square fit to find the coefficients of the polynomial to use for such photometric calibration .",
    "if either @xmath6 or @xmath8 magnitudes were not available for a given star , we adopted the average zero - point between @xmath5-filter and @xmath14magnitudes .",
    "for the added stars , which magnitudes are already in the @xmath14system , we used a simple zero - point between the _ k2_selected exposure and the _",
    "k2_master frame to adjust the magnitudes .    at the end of our integration process , we have four modified aics ( maics ) , one for each channel , that differ each other for the number of added stars and for the slightly different calibration equation .",
    "such maics were finally used as input lists during the lc - extraction phase .      for each channel , we extracted the lcs for all objects in the corresponding maic as described in @xcite and .",
    "briefly , for each target star in our input list we used six - parameter , global linear transformations to convert its maic position into that of each individual _ k2_exposure . only bright",
    ", well - measured unsaturated stars were used to compute the coefficients of these transformations .",
    "we then measured its flux both in the original and in the neighbour - subtracted images . in the latter case ,",
    "we subtracted from the image all close - by stars which light contamination would affect the lc of our target .",
    "m44 field is rather sparse , however , in some cases , there are close - by stars for which the light - dilution effects can be important during the lc analysis . for each star we performed 1- , 1.5- , 2- and 2.5-pixel aperture and psf - fitting photometry",
    "hereafter , we will consider only the neighbour - subtracted lcs .",
    "the lcs were corrected for the different systematic effects that usually harm _ k2_data . at variance with _",
    "k2_campaign 0 , the spacecraft drift was smaller . by simply applying the position - dependent correction of",
    ", we found that the result was not very good , in particular since a few day before the mid - campaign argabrightening event when the stars on the ccds changed drift pattern because of the change of the relative positioning of the spacecraft with respect to the sun .",
    "furthermore , several stars showed long - term effects not ascribable to intrinsic variability .",
    "therefore , we improved our lc detrend with respect to our first work and added a new , preliminary correction .",
    "we refer to our companion paper on the same _ k2_/c5 data",
    "( nardiello et al . ,",
    "mnras submitted ) focused on the oc m67 for a detailed description of this systematic - correction stage . in a nutshell",
    ", the correction can be summarised as follows .     -5.5pt   -5.5pt   -5.5pt   -7.5pt    we first removed the most of the systematic trends that are in common among the different lcs in a given _ k2_channel . to this task",
    "we used the cotrending basis vectors ( cbvs ) released with each _",
    "k2_campaign data set from the third onward , in a similar way as done by the official _ kepler_pipeline .",
    "for each normalised - flux raw lc we modelled the systematic trends using a linear combination of the cbvs .",
    "the coefficients of such combination were computed adopting a levenberg - marquardt minimisation method @xcite . for variable stars we noticed that sometimes the cotrend algorithm tries to include the stellar variability as well in the cbv linear combination , causing a worsening of the lc . for this reason , for each star we checked if the lc scatter improved after this cotrend stage . if not , we used as coefficients of the cbv combination the average coefficients computed for all stars across the channel . this way we found an improvement of the lc scatter , even if sometimes it left some long - term systematics .    the cotrend correction",
    "also partially compensated for the drift - induced trends .",
    "however , the correction was based on the common behaviour of the stars on the ccd , therefore , in order to fine tune it , we applied to each lc our iterative , position - based detrend as done in .",
    "briefly , we first normalised the raw lc by its median flux and created a lc model . at odds of",
    ", the lc model was not obtained with a running - median filter , but with a linear interpolation .",
    "we segmented the lc in different bins and , in each bin , we computed the 3.5@xmath17-clipped average flux of the points .",
    "the boundaries of each bin were defined by two consecutive thruster - jet firings , identified thanks to the `` jumps '' in the @xmath18/@xmath19 raw positions during time .",
    "the lc model was generated by linearly interpolating the lc among these bin average values . finally , we removed the correlation between ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) raw positions and model - subtracted - lc fluxes with a look - up table of correction applied with a simple bi - linear interpolation . by working with the model - subtracted lc",
    ", we avoided to wrongly correct also the intrinsic variability of the star .",
    "this correction , in particular the cotrend part , is still in a preliminary phase .",
    "indeed , we used all 16 cbvs to perform the correction . in most cases ,",
    "the correction works very well .",
    "however , a few stars still show residual long - term systematic effects that could hamper , even if only partially , a variability study .",
    "the best solution should be to check all the possible combinations of cbvs and find which combination leads to the best photometric precision and preserves the intrinsic stellar signal .",
    "since such long terms do not affect the search for eclipsing or transiting objects on these processed lcs , we postpone the refinement of this cotrend correction to future works of the series .      in fig .",
    "[ fig_rms ] we show the 6.5-h rms for each of the four analysed channels .",
    "thanks to observations achieved with a lower spacecraft jitter , the pixel - to - pixel variations are less effective and the photometric precision was slightly better than in , with a best value of @xmath013 parts - per - million ( ppm ) .",
    "the @xmath14instrumental magnitudes were registered onto the @xmath14system with zero - points ( one for each channel and lc - extraction photometric method ) obtained by comparing our lc - based @xmath14instrumental magnitudes with the epic ( ecliptic plane input catalog ) ` _ _ gri__'-based @xmath14magnitudes .    as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig_rms ] , the psf - based photometry ( as well as the 1-pixel aperture photometry ) is more suitable for faint stars with @xmath20 . this threshold is set @xmath21 @xmath14magnitudes lower than in . however , by only focusing on the 2.5-pixel - aperture ( the largest aperture adopted in this work ) and the psf photometry , the threshold at which one method overcomes the other is at about @xmath22 , similar to that found in our first work . in fig .",
    "[ fig_rms_all ] we show the simple rms , the p2p rms and the 6.5-h rms for the 2.5-pixel - aperture and the psf photometry in which we collected all module-14 lcs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_rms_all ] we also marked with different symbols stars included in the original aic and those that were added to cover the remaining tpfs outside the aic fov .",
    "no clear dichotomy arises from the plot , meaning that our photometric calibrations while building the maics , as well as the registration onto the @xmath14system , are good .",
    "to find variable stars ( e.g. , spot - modulated and pulsating stars , eclipsing binaries , transiting objects ) , we started by selecting for each star the lc among the five obtained with the different photometric methods that shows , on average , the best 6.5-hour rms in the corresponding magnitude interval .",
    "thruster - jet - related events were purged from the lc as in , while outliers were removed by performing an asymmetric @xmath17 clipping ( defined as the 68.27@xmath23 percentile of the distribution around the median ) values .",
    "we then excluded from the subsequent lc analysis all points which values were at least @xmath24 brighter or @xmath25 fainter than the median in the corresponding bin . ] .",

    "for gls and aov , we then plotted the snr as a function of the period and selected by hand stars that show an high snr .",

    "an overview of the candidates is presented in fig .",
    "[ espg_over ] .",
    "single - transit objects were not considered in our analysis .          to verify the goodness of the seven candidates , we first visually inspected the lcs of the variable stars within 100 _ kepler_pixels from each candidate to search for possible eclipsing binaries miming the transit event and found that these candidates are sufficiently isolated .",
    "we then investigated a possible correlation between transit events and stellar position . to this task",
    ", we can not use the position of the star in the raw - image reference frame because of the _ kepler_pointing jitter that moves the stars on the ccd and harms the true comprehension of any possible correlation between the transit event and the star location .",
    "therefore we needed an `` absolute '' reference frame in which we can safely compare the positions and we chose that of the maic .",
    "the position of the star in the maic reference - frame system at each epoch was computed as follows . in each _",
    "k2_/c5 image , we subtracted all close - by neighbours to the exoplanet candidate as done during the lc extraction .",
    "we then estimated the position of the star by psf fitting and transformed it onto the maic reference frame by inverting the six - parameter , global linear transformations adopted during the lc extraction ( see sect .  [ lcextr ] ) . within the transformation and",
    "the geometric - distortion errors , for our seven candidates no clear correlations arise ( panel f in fig .",
    "[ espg_1_2 ] , [ espg_3_4 ] , [ espg_5_6 ] and [ espg_7 ] ) .",
    "after these validations , we fitted a transit model to extract the transit parameters of these candidates . in order to have a preliminary estimate , we combined the particle - swarm algorithm ` pyswarm ` with the @xcite model implemented in ` pytransit ` @xcite , and used the ` emcee ` algorithm @xcite to compute the corresponding errors . for each candidate we adopted the stellar parameters ( mass and radius ) provided by @xcite , retrieved from the _ k2_exofop website .",
    "we started by purging the most of the outliers from the flattened lcs in order to avoid to model spurious artefacts .",
    "we adopted three different methods , tailored for each candidate , to obtain the best purged lc for the subsequent analysis : ( i ) we subtracted a crude transit model and performed a 3- , 5- or 10-@xmath17 clipping in the observed - minus - model plane ; ( ii ) we selected only transit neighbourhoods and discarded the off - transit parts of the lc ; ( iii ) we combined the previous two approaches .    in our transit modelling we made some assumptions .",
    "we fixed the eccentricity ( @xmath40 ) and the argument of pericentre ( @xmath41 ) to 0 and 90 deg , respectively .",
    "for the limb darkening , we chose a quadratic law and computed the linear and quadratic coefficients with jktld @xcite that makes use of the table of @xcite .",
    "as input for jktld , we adopted @xmath42 , @xmath43 and [ m / h ] released in exofop , while the microturbolence velocity was fixed at 2 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the only values that we chose to characterise were the period ( @xmath44 ) , the mid - transit time of reference ( @xmath45 ) , the inclination ( @xmath46 ) and the radii ratio ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "for each parameter , we set specific limit values within which to search for the best estimate .",
    "we defined @xmath44 and @xmath45 boundaries around guess values obtained by running vartools bls .",
    "the inclination and the radii ratio were allowed to span a wide range of values , between 70 deg and 110 deg for @xmath46 and between @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "once set the parameter limits , we let the ` pyswarm ` algorithm span within the boundaries with 180 different parameter configurations for 10000 iterations .",
    "we evaluated the goodness of the fit as the reduced chi - square :      where @xmath52 with @xmath5 number of data points in the lc , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the observed and the model data - point value , @xmath55 is the associated error equal to the intrinsic dispersion percentile of the residuals with respect to the median value of the flattened lc .",
    "] of the flattened lc , and `` dof '' means degrees of freedom ( the difference between the number of data points and the number of fitting parameters ) .",
    "then , we took the 60 best combinations to initialise the walkers for the ` emcee ` algorithm .",
    "for each fitting parameter we used uniform priors within the same boundaries defined in ` pyswarm ` .",
    "we let the 60 walkers evolve for 40000 steps , maximising the log - likelihood defined as :      the best parameters were computed as the median values of the posterior distributions after conservatively discarding as burn - in phase the first 10000 steps to ensure the convergence of the chains .",
    "the related errors were defined as the 68.27@xmath23 percentile of the absolute residuals with respect to the median of the posterior distributions of the fitted parameters .    in table  [ tab : exo ] we list all parameters obtained by our lc modelling .",
    "again , we emphasise that our model is strongly dependent on the ( fixed ) stellar parameter we adopted . a more - reliable estimate of the exoplanet parameters may be obtained after a rv follow - up ( at least for the brightest targets ) . as reference",
    ", we also report the photometric transit depth @xmath57 .",
    "this value was computed as follows .",
    "we normalised the lc by its median flux and phased it using the period given by our previous analysis .",
    "we set the transit centre at @xmath58 and computed @xmath57 as the median value of the points with @xmath59 .",
    "the related error was computed as :      where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the 68.27@xmath32 percentile of the distribution around the median for the points in ( @xmath63 ) and out of transit , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the number of points used in the calculation .",
