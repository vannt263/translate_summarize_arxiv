    "this is because supersaturation decreases with increasing box size and the resultant critical droplet size is increased . in lmwlcs ,",
    "the supersaturation relaxes locally and quickly to the equilibrium state . on the other hand , in lcps ,",

    "[ fig : defect - sep](a ) also suggests that the defect motion before the annihilation becomes asymmetric ; the defect for @xmath166 moves faster than the defect for @xmath167 .",

    "even if rotational motion is not allowed , the polymers being nearly parallel to each other assemble to form a nematic grain in the early stage of the phase transition .",
    "since the director field is randomly oriented before the quenching of the isotopic phase , a polydomain structure is formed and many defects remain at the grain boundaries .",
    "the polydomain growth then exhibits self - similarity and the growth exponent is @xmath132 , which is considerably smaller than that for nematic liquid crystals of low molecular weight molecules .",

    "hence , the crossover length is increased with the average volume fraction @xmath58 as @xmath215 . in a melt of lcps or a highly concentrated solution of rodlike polymers , the crossover might be experimentally accessible , and we hope that our numerical study will stimulate detailed experimental observations in these systems in the near future .",
