    "qcd analysis of deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data provides one with new knowledge of hadron physics and serves as a test of reliability of our theoretical understanding of the hard scattering of leptons and hadrons . at large momentum transfer @xmath3 gev@xmath4 we have the reliable description of dis that is based on the twist expansion and `` factorization '' theorems . at small ( moderate ) transfer @xmath5 ( a few ) gev@xmath4",
    "this qcd description faces two main problems : ( i ) the high twist corrections to the leading twist contribution become important but remains poorly known ; ( ii ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) becomes unreliable due to the fact that the qcd running coupling @xmath6 grows and `` feels '' infra - red landau singularity appearing at the scale @xmath7 of a few tenth of gev .",
    "we discuss in this paper a solution of the last problem by applying to dis analysis a _ nonpower perturbative theory _",
    "whose couplings have no singularity at @xmath8 and whose corresponding series possess a better convergence at low @xmath9 .    a widely used approach to resolve the aforementioned problem is to apply the analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) developed by shirkov , solovtsov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . there ,",
    "the running qcd coupling @xmath10 of pqcd is transformed into an analytic ( holomorphic ) function of @xmath9 , @xmath11 , apt coupling .",
    "this was achieved by keeping in the dispersion relation the spectral density @xmath12 unchanged on the entire negative axis in the complex @xmath9-plane ( i.e. , for @xmath13 ) , and setting it equal to zero along the unphysical cut @xmath14 . in the framework of apt",
    "the images @xmath15 of integer powers of the originals @xmath16 , @xmath17 following the same dispersion relations were also constructed . at low @xmath9 the couplings @xmath18 change slowly with @xmath9 in contrast with the original @xmath16 behaviour while at high @xmath9 @xmath19 .",
    "later , the correspondence @xmath20 was extended to noninteger powers / indices @xmath21 in  @xcite and was called fractional apt ( fapt ) , which provides the basis for application to dis . in this respect",
    "let us mention a recent papers @xcite where the processing of the dis data has been performed in fapt in the one - loop approximation and the reasonable results for hadron characteristics has been obtained .",
    "various analytic qcd models can be constructed , and have been proposed in the literature , among them in refs .",
    "these models fulfill certain additional constraints at low and/or at high @xmath9 . for further literature on various analytic qcd models ,",
    "we refer to review articles @xcite . some newer constructions of analytic models in qcd of @xmath22 include those based on specific classes of @xmath23 functions with nonperturbative contributions @xcite or without such contributions @xcite and those based on modifications of the the spectral density @xmath24 @xmath25   \\equiv { \\rm i m } \\ ; { { \\mathcal{a}}}_{1}(q^2=-\\sigma - i \\epsilon)/\\pi\\right]$ ] at low ( positive ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is parameterized in a specific manner by adding two positive delta functions to @xmath28 , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the possibility to extend the dis analysis formally in the whole @xmath9 range together with the effect of slowing - down of the fapt evolution of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) in the low @xmath9 region are attractive phenomenological features of fapt .",
    "a number of works deal with this task in a naive form @xcite , where the authors show that at very low @xmath9 and bjorken variable @xmath29 apt agrees with experimental data . besides",
    ", the applicability of the apt approach was analyzed in the bjorken polarized sum rule @xcite confirming that the range of validity of apt is down to @xmath30 mev , as compared to experimental data .",
    "the common feature of these works was taking into consideration some nonperturbative effects against the background of apt , i.e. , higher twists in @xcite or an effective constant gluon mass in @xcite .",
    "the basis for applying fapt to low energies in this approach is the factorization theorem that allows one to shift the frontier between the perturbative and nonperturbative effects via the variation of the factorization scale .",
    "therefore , we shift the range where perturbation series is applicable in fapt , as it was demonstrated in @xcite ( see reviews of this issue in @xcite , where this phenomenon was also discussed for pion form factors ) .",
    "our goal here is to elaborate a general scheme of dis data processing in the framework of fapt taking as a pattern the dis analysis at nlo . in this respect the discussion here",
    "can be considered as an extension of the partonic results of the article @xcite on the higher - loop level .",
    "we shall focus on the specifics of the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution of the pdf @xmath31 in fapt .",
    "we involve into consideration the coefficient function @xmath32 of the process and compare the final result with a similar one in pqcd .",
    "an important problem of higher twist contribution remains untouched here , but higher twist effects can be taken as an unknown function @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 @xcite , or as a constant @xcite @xmath35 , or as an effective sum of all twists contributions in @xcite .",
    "we stress that ht effects are only indirectly affected by the analytization procedure .",
    "the behavior of ht will be given by the fit of experimental data together with the corresponding parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "besides , in @xcite the authors included more terms in the ht expansion and demonstrated that they are essentially smaller and quickly decreasing . because of this ( theoretically ) unknown behavior we avoid this problem since we pretend to provide perturbation tools how to deal with fapt , while the pure phenomenological analysis is transferred to future investigations .",
    "let us recall that the dis analysis can be performed in a few different ways : one of them is provided by the mellin moments defined via inelastic structure functions ( sfs ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 the second approach is based on the direct application of the dglap integro - differential evolution equations  @xcite to pdf @xmath38 , while the observable sf is the mellin convolution of the coefficient function and pdf , @xmath39 .",
    "the third approach makes use of the jacobi polynomial expansion method  @xcite .",
    "just this method will be used in this work .",

    "we shall focus here on nonsinglet ( ns ) structure functions , @xmath41 , with their corresponding mellin moments @xmath42 ( via eq .",
    "( [ moments ] ) ) to avoid technical complications of the coupled system solution in the singlet case .",
    "the pdfs @xmath43 are universal process - independent densities explaining how the whole hadron momentum @xmath44 is partitioned in @xmath45 , i.e. , the momentum carried by the struck parton ( see , for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath29-dependence of pdf is formed at a hadron scale of an order of @xmath46 by nonperturbative forces , while its dependence on factorization / renormalization scale @xmath47 can be obtained within perturbation theory .",
    "a brief description of the evolution of the mellin moments in pqcd , up to nlo , is outlined in appendix  [ app1 ] as well as the theoretical background with our notation and conventions .",
    "we consider the scale @xmath48 as a reference scale for the solution of the evolution equation  ( [ mns ] ) where the pdfs are regarded as functions of @xmath29 and the parameters are fixed by comparison with dis data . in particular , we use here the data - based mstw pdfs ( see  @xcite , where @xmath49 ) . namely , x u_v(x , q_0 ^ 2)&=&a_u x^_1(1-x)^_2(1+_u + _ u x ) , + x d_v(x , q_0 ^ 2)&=&a_d x^_3(1-x)^_4(1+_d + _ d x ) , [ mstw ] where the values of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be found in  @xcite . we use only the valence quark pdfs because the ns pdf @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 ( see appendix  [ app1 ] for details ) .",
