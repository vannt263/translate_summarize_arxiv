    "initially of interest as a potential coolant for molecular clouds , hydrogen chloride ( hcl ) was first detected in the @xmath0 transition at 625.918  ghz @xcite toward irc2 in orion a , in emission , by @xcite , and in absorption against dust continuum in sgr  b2 , by @xcite , both aboard the nasa kuiper airborne observatory with a beam width of 23 .",
    "ground - based observations at a higher spatial resolution of 12  were carried out using the 10.4-m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) by @xcite and @xcite toward omc-1 and monr2 .",
    "@xcite also detected the h  @xmath0 transition toward omc-1 .",
    "these studies found the hcl abundance to be @xmath9 relative to molecular hydrogen , indicating that chlorine is depleted by a factor of several hundred compared to its solar neighborhood abundance , and that hcl is not a significant coolant of molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite also reported a [ ] / [ ] isotopic ratio that is @xmath10 times higher than the solar neighborhood value , indicating variations of the isotropic ratio in the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "chemistry of chlorine and hydrogen chloride in the interstellar medium has been investigated by a number of authors @xcite , establishing a relatively simple chemical network involving less than a dozen other atomic and molecular species , as well as electrons and cosmic - ray particles , in the production and destruction of hcl . in dense molecular clouds , such a network yields , among other species ,",
    "predominantly hcl , taking up about one third of the chlorine in gas phase @xcite .",
    "hcl @xmath0 transition falls on the shoulder of a relatively strong atmospheric water absorption line .",
    "consequently , ground - based observations of hcl have been limited to the rare occasions of superb weather at high sites , such as mauna kea , and relatively little is known about hcl in different categories of objects , such as evolved stars , active star forming regions , molecular clouds with no apparent star formation activity , etc .",
    "in particular , the [ @xmath11cl]/[@xmath12cl ] isotopic ratio is of interest in different categories of objects , as variations of this ratio can be produced through nucleosynthesis in massive stars followed by mixing of the processed material into the surrounding molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the chlorine isotopic ratio could thus offer insights into the evolutionary history of the molecular material .    to address these questions , we took advantage of several periods of superb weather on mauna kea to conduct a comprehensive survey of hcl in a sample of well known objects . in the following sections , we first describe the observational details ,",
    "then present the results and data analysis , followed by discussions and conclusions .",
    "observations described here were carried out on september 11 , 2008 , march 2 , and april 715 , 2010 with the 10.4  meter cso telescope .",
    "the 690  ghz facility heterodyne receiver was tuned to 625.918756 ghz and 624.977821 ghz , respectively , for observations of hcl @xmath0 and h  @xmath13 lines .",
    "the lines fall on the shoulder of a prominent atmospheric water absorption line , therefore requiring premium weather conditions .",
    "the atmospheric opacity measured at 225 ghz was mostly 0.030.04 , and the typical double - side - band system temperature was 2500  k. there were marginal periods in april 7 - 15 , 2010 when atmospheric opacity was around 0.050.06 , resulting in a typical system temperature of 6000  k. both the ffts and 4  ghz aos facility spectrometers were used in 1  ghz mode as backends .",
    "the dish surface optimization system ( dsos ) @xcite was used to correct gravitational deformations of the telescope surface , maintaining a clean 135 beam over a wide range of elevations .",
    "temperature calibration using a hot chopper wheel yields @xmath14 , the antenna temperature corrected for atmosphere and telescope hot spillover . a main beam efficiency of @xmath650% measured on jupiter and uranus is used to convert @xmath14 to @xmath15 , the main beam brightness temperature . telescope pointing was checked on jupiter , mars , and uranus , and was found to be within 4 .",
    "observations were conducted in the beam switching mode at a frequency of 0.523  hz and with a chop throw of 300 .",
    "typical integration time on each source was 300 seconds , resulting in a rms of @xmath60.15 k at a velocity resolution of 0.31 .",
    "the source selection was primarily based on its accessibility at reasonable elevations , with a secondary goal of covering a diverse collection of objects . due to its high critical density ( @xmath610@xmath16 @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the excitation of the hcl @xmath0 transition is most likely sub - thermal , and radiative excitation , in the presence of continuum emission , is likely to play an important role in the excitation of the transition .",
    "the presence of dense gas and/or continuum radiation in an object would likely yield a detection . in the end , 25 sources / positions were observed , among them active star forming regions , giant molecular clouds with no apparent star forming activities , evolved stars , shocked gas in a snr , and ultra - compact hii regions .",
    "table  [ tab : obs - sum ] lists observational details for all observed sources .",
    "for sources with matching hcl and h  @xmath0 spectra , we present in figures  [ fig : spectra1][fig : spectra3 ] hcl spectra in the left column and h  spectra in the right column .",
    "the antenna temperature scale is kept the same for each source for easy comparison of the line intensities .",
    "the velocity scale , @xmath17 , refers to the main hyperfine component ; values of @xmath18 are denoted in each panel . toward irc2 in omc-1 ,",
    "the hcl and h  line profiles are blended heavily with spectral lines from other species , in the case for h   predominantly methanol .",
    "it is not easy to untangle the blending and derive useful information from the resulting line profile .",
    "instead we opted to observe two positions south of irc2 with declination offsets of 60  and 100 , respectively .",
    "the two positions correspond to local maxima in the hcl map of omc-1 by @xcite .",
    "the ( 0 , 60 ) position also coincides with the cs clump ls1 @xcite , and the ( 0 , 100 ) position orion  s. figure  [ fig : spectra4 ] show the hcl @xmath0 spectra for the remaining sources in the sample .",
    "the hcl hyperfine structure , resulting from the interaction between the electric field and chlorine nuclear spin , splits the @xmath0 transition into three components , with the outer two separated by @xmath19 and 8.22  respectively from the strongest middle component for h. for h , the separations are @xmath20  and 6.45 , respectively .",
    "statistical weights for the upper level of the hyperfine transitions dictate optically thin line strength ratio of 1:3:2 . in the observed sample ,",
    "the three - component hyperfine pattern is clearly seen in many sources , but the components often do not conform to the optically thin ratio , indicating deviations from the optically thin limit or differences in excitation between the three components .    under the assumption that the hyperfine components share the same excitation and kinematic characteristics , fits to the line profiles can independently provide the optical depth and excitation temperature @xcite .",
    "such a utility is readily available in class , the spectral line data reduction package developed and maintained by iram .",
    "the hfs fit in class provides four parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 the line width , and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath24 is the total optical depth from all hyperfine components of the line , and @xmath25 is the difference between the line excitation temperature and background temperature .",
    "table  [ tab : line - fit ] lists results of such hyperfine structure fits for sources in our sample that show the @xmath0 hcl or h  emission .",
    "cases involving absorption are more complex , as seen in g34.26 + 0.15 and w43-mm1 in fig-[fig : spectra3 ] for example .",
    "they are often the result of a delicate balance between emission and absorption features .",
    "we defer the treatment and discussions for sources with absorption to a separate paper @xcite .    in fitting the hyperfine profiles in @xmath15 scale , one needs to be mindful that the line emission may suffer from beam dilution when a source is smaller than the telescope beam .",
    "the uncorrected line temperatures would affect the excitation temperature and optical depth derived from hfs fit of the hcl line profile .",
    "thermal dust emission as seen in submillimeter continuum maps provide a good measure for gas distribution in the source .",
    "we compare the size of the 350@xmath26 m dust cores to the telescope beam of 135 to determine whether the hcl emission from a given source suffers appreciable beam dilution .",
    "most of our sources in the sample are observed by @xcite with the sharp camera at the cso , and the fwhm of the dust cores range from @xmath630  to @xmath660 .",
    "we therefore do not consider beam dilution a significant source of error for our sample of objects in deriving the excitation temperature and optical depth for the hcl @xmath0 transition .",
    "one exception may be g5.89 - 0.39 , where sma continuum image at 870@xmath26 m reveals a dust core @xmath27  in size @xcite , implying a factor of @xmath28 in beam dilution in the observed line temperature .",
    "the hfs fits are sensitive to the signal - to - noise ratio in the observed line profiles .",
    "@xmath29 and hence @xmath24 are not well constrained for relatively noisy line profiles . for sources with both hcl and h  detections , one would expect that the values of @xmath29 derived from hfs fits of the two transitions be very close . in reality , they tend to agree within error bars , albeit rather large error bars in some cases , resulting in questionable estimates of the optical depths .",
    "we attempted to derive alternative estimates of the optical depths for both hcl and h  lines by imposing a fixed value of @xmath30 , a weighted average of the values obtained for the two lines . using @xmath30 and the @xmath15 from gaussian fits of the three components in each profile , we derive @xmath31(hcl)@xmath32 and @xmath31(h)@xmath32 as listed in table  [ tab : line - fit ] .",
    "the error of @xmath15/@xmath33 amplified by @xmath34 translates into the error of @xmath35 for each components , resulting in relatively large errors for @xmath35 derived from this approach when individual components are optically thick .",
    "we nonetheless consider @xmath35 a more reliable measure of the optical depth than that obtained directly from hfs fits . for sources that have only hcl observations , @xmath30 and @xmath36hcl)@xmath32 in table  [ tab : line - fit ]",
    "are from direct hfs fits . for g5.89 - 0.39 , we also present fits corrected for the likely case of beam dilution .",
    "compared to the uncorrected case , the differences are mostly in the line excitation temperatures , with optical depth remain largely unchanged .",
    "irc+10216 shows a rather distinctive line profile .",
    "it is likely the result of convolution of the hyperfine structure with a shell profile often seen in circumstellar envelopes . as an approximation",
    ", we chose to fit two gaussian profiles for irc+10216 at lsr velocities of @xmath37  and @xmath38  , respectively , to simulate the shell profile in the hyperfine fits .",
    "as shown by the red curve in the appropriate panel in figure  [ fig : spectra2 ] , this approach adequately fits the line profile , yielding a solution that indicates that the hcl emission originated from a circumstellar shell with an expansion velocity of 4.8 , compared to an observed terminal velocity of 14.5 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the [ h]/[h ] isotopic ratio in the shell is likely in excess of 4 from the optical depth shown in table  [ tab : line - fit ] .",
    "cit6 is widely regarded as similar to irc+10216 with comparable chemical and physical characteristics , but a lower dust - to - molecular mass ratio @xcite .",
    "hcl is no exception in that regard .",
    "it is clearly detected but the line is too weak to allow for a good hfs fit .",
    "nevertheless , this observation serves as an additional proof that hcl as a species exists in detectable quantities in circumstellar shells of evolved stars .",
    "ic443g1 is a dense core in a ring of shocked material associated with snr ic443 @xcite .",
    "there are tantalizing signs of hcl detection , but the line is again too weak to derive any useful parameters .    g5.89 - 0.39 is another interesting case with a rather distinctive line profile .",
    "both hcl and h   line show a pronounced red wing , indicating presence of higher velocity components .",
    "a three - component fit , as shown by the red curve in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : spectra3 ] , represents an excellent match to the observed line profile .",
    "as listed in table  [ tab : line - fit ] , the three components are at lsr velocities of 9.3 , 17.9 , and 38.3 , with fwhm line widths of 4.9 , 13.5 , and 5.4 , respectively . from the interferometric study of @xcite , the broad ( @xmath613 ) line emission is seen in c@xmath39s , sio , ch@xmath40oh , hc@xmath40n , c@xmath41o , and h@xmath42co@xmath43 toward the dust emission source sma - n , in the north - northeast extension of the molecular ridge that bounds the northern and western edge of the uchii .",
    "the 9.3   feature likely originates from the northwest and southwest section of the molecular ridge . while the origin of the 38.3   feature is not immediately clear , velocity features as highly redshifted as 78   and blue - shifted as -61  , mostly from various masers , were quoted by these authors in establishing a north - south bipolar outflow . in deriving the alternate optical depth of these velocity components in table  [ tab",
    ": line - fit ] , we opted to use the @xmath29 from the hcl hfs fits for the 17.9  and 38.3  components due to their low s / n ratio in the h  line profile . from the derived @xmath35 in table  [ tab : line - fit ] , the [ hcl / h ] isotopic ratio in the source is most likely around 2 , though the broad emission feature may have a higher ratio on the order of 34 .",
    "sgr  a@xmath32 , the dynamical center of the galaxy , yields no hcl detection to an rms level of 0.1 k at a resolution of 0.31  .",
    "similarly , g1.6 - 0.025 , a giant molecular cloud in the galactic center region with no apparent sign of star formation , also yields a non - detection .",
    "sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) , on the other hand , show broad strong absorption at both hcl and h@xmath0 transitions .    from table  [ tab : line - fit ] , it it clear that the [ h]/[h ] isotopic ratio , based on that of the optical depth , is rather varied , from 4 and over in mon  r2 , irc+10216 , and dr21(oh ) , to around 3 in omc-1 , w3(oh ) , and iras16293 , down to around 2 in g5.89 - 0.39 , and to nearly reaching parity in w3irs4 and w3irs5 . in comparison , the terrestrial [ ]",
    "/ [ ] abundance ratio is @xmath63.1 .",
    "in addition to the optical depth obtained from hyperfine structure fitting , we can derive other physical parameters from the line profiles by running lvg simulations to fit the three hcl hyperfine components .",
    "radex , a computer program developed and maintained by @xcite for fast non - lte analysis of interstellar line spectra , was used in the lvg mode to find the best combination of gas density and hcl column density that could reproduce the observed line temperatures under given gas temperature .",
    "the molecular data file for hcl under radex includes the hyperfine levels of the lowest 8 rotational levels , up to 839 k above ground level , with rates for radiative and collisional transitions among them .",
    "the collisional rates between hcl and  are scaled from those of hcl and helium @xcite .",
    "the average galactic background radiation field adopted in radex consists of the cosmic microwave background , average galactic starlight in the solar neighborhood in ultraviolet / visible / near - infrared part of the spectrum , and single - temperature fit to the galactic thermal dust emission for the far - infrared and submillimeter part of the spectrum .",
    "contributions from non - thermal radiation in the galaxy are also included for low frequency part of the spectrum ( @xmath4430 ghz ) .",
    "this composite interstellar radiation field and any additional continuum background from user input provide radiative excitation in the radex formulism . for the subset of our sample where hcl emission is observed ,",
    "no significant continuum is seen in any of these sources .",
    "we therefore use the default composite interstellar radiation field in radex simulations .",
    "simulations were run in off - line mode to cover a large parameter space , and relative @xmath45 was sought between the observed line temperatures and the model results relative to the observed line temperature . under the assumption that the observed hcl emission suffers no significant beam dilution , this process yields for a given gas temperature the most likely combination of gas density and hcl column density to reproduce the observed line strength of the hyperfine components . figure  [ fig : radex ] shows a radex simulation run for omc-1 ( 0 , -60 ) with a gas temperature of 45 k. contours",

    ", we generally use 30% to set the error bar for the optical depth . the cross - section between the @xmath45 contours and the optical depth curves clearly confines gas density and hcl column density in an often tight range .",
    "table  [ tab : radex - fit ] lists for each source the adopted gas temperature and  column density , the gas density and hcl column density derived from radex simulations , as well as the hcl abundance .",
    "since there is no molecular data file for h  to use under radex , we treat it the same as hcl and fit the h  line temperatures with the same procedure . instead of confining the ranges of gas density and h  column density with the relative @xmath45 contours and optical depth curves",
    ", we use gas density ranges found in the corresponding hcl simulation of the source in place of optical depth curves , ensuring that both hcl and h  emission originated from the same region .",
    "the resulting h  column density is listed in table  [ tab : radex - fit ] for sources with observed h  line emission . for these sources we also list the /  abundance ratio x[/ ] as measured by the ratio of hcl and h  column densities .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that the integrated intensity ratio be a good gauge for hcl and h  isotopic ratio .",
    "we listed in table  [ tab : radex - fit ] the integrated intensity ratio , r , which appears to be in good agreement with our derived chlorine isotopic ratio .",
    "from table  [ tab : radex - fit ] it is clear that hcl emission is associated with warm dense gas with a density on the order of 10@xmath47 @xmath3 . given a critical density of a few @xmath48 @xmath3 , molecular excitation is mostly sub - thermal , dominated by radiative processes rather than collisions with .",
    "sources with strong continuum and/or dust emission would likely yield strong hcl line emission .    the derived gas densities for the two omc-1 cores appear to be somewhat higher than @xmath49 established by the multi - transitional study of hc@xmath40n @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that the gas temperatures adopted for these cores for the radex simulations should have been higher .",
    "another factor may be the average galactic background radiation field used in radex for radiative excitation .",
    "as hcl transitions are short - ward of @xmath6480@xmath26 m in wavelength , radiation from warm dust would contribute significantly to the molecular excitation . including local warm dust in the radiation field for radex simulation would produce a more precise picture of the gas where hcl emission originates .",

    "the non - detection in g1.6 - 0.025 is intriguing .",
    "the source is a giant molecular cloud located in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) of the galaxy , a region characterized by elevated gas temperature ( typically @xmath670 k ) , higher gas density ( @xmath59  @xmath3 ) , and highly supersonic internal velocity dispersion ( @xmath61550  ) @xcite .",
    "dense cloud cores are seen in various molecular tracers @xcite , yet there is little sign of apparent star forming activity in the cloud .",

    "these authors argued that such deficiency could be the result of disruption of chemical network brought on by the infusion of atomic hydrogen to the shocked gas by repeated shocks , as atomic hydrogen rapidly destroys many of the intermediate molecules in the reaction network . to derive an estimate of hcl column density from the low signal - to - noise detection , we use radex simulation to reproduce an hcl line of 0.2 k with a fwhm of 10  @xcite .",
    "the resulting hcl column density of @xmath64  @xmath54 , when compared to an  column density of @xmath61 @xcite , leads to an hcl abundance of @xmath65 .",

    "of the 27 sources / positions observed , fourteen show emission , nine show absorption , two showed marginal detection in emission , and two are non - detections .",
    "fourteen of the sources / positions were also observed in the h  @xmath0 transition .",
    "radex simulations show that hcl emission is mostly associated with warm dense gas , of order @xmath75 @xmath3 .",
    "hcl abundance is fairly uniform , in the range @xmath76 to a few @xmath77 , in general agreement with previous studies of omc-1 by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "they are in good agreement to the integrated intensity ratios of the hcl and hline as suggested by @xcite .",

    "they could be supported by the varying yields of nucleosynthesis of supervoae from different progenitors .",
    "the low /   abundance ratios seen in w3irs4 and w3irs5 likely confine the progenitors of the supernovae to stars of relatively high mass ( @xmath725m@xmath8 ) and high metallicity ( z@xmath60.02 ) .",
