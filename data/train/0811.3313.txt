    "the ability of calculating accurately the energetics of metal hydrides is a key issue in the design of novel materials , which might turn out to be useful in the current search for suitable hydrogen storage ( hs ) media . in particular , the kinetics of hydrogen absorption is one of the main questions which determine the functionality of a candidate hs material .",
    "magnesium is an interesting hydrogen absorbant , because the hydride ( mgh@xmath0 ) formed after exposure to h@xmath0 can store a large amount of h ( 7.6 % by weight ) , which can be later released by heating the material above @xmath3c@xcite , the reaction being endothermic with an enthalpy of decomposition of 76 kj / mole  @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of hydrogen intake by mg is quite slow , because of a relatively large energy barrier that the h@xmath0 molecule needs to overcome in order to dissociate before adsorption .",
    "however , it is possible to modify this material to improve its properties , for example by doping it with traces of transition metals  @xcite , which have been shown to be very effective at reducing the activation energy for hydrogen dissociation  @xcite , and also to somewhat reduce the decomposition temperature of the hydride  @xcite .",
    "so far , the only high level quantum mechanics calculations available for the interaction of hydrogen with mg surfaces are based on density functional theory ( dft ) , which has been shown to be quite successful for investigating the relative energetics of the interaction of h@xmath0 with pure and transition metal doped mg surfaces  @xcite .",
    "however , the absolute accuracy of dft has often been called into question .",
    "for example , we recently showed that the dft calculated value for the enthalpy of formation of mgh@xmath0 from mg bulk and h@xmath0 , a quantity obviously related to the interaction between h and mg , strongly depends on the functional employed , with values ranging from 0.29 ev ( with rpbe ) to 0.82 ev ( with lda )  @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods  @xcite are becoming promising techniques to improve beyond dft , with their increased utilisation favoured by the availability of faster and faster computers . recently ,",
    "diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations on mg and mgh@xmath0 bulk showed very good accuracy in both structural parameters , cohesive energies , and the enthalpy of formation of the mgh@xmath0 crystal  @xcite .",
    "here we have coupled dmc to climbing image nudget elastic band ( neb ) dft calculations to compute the energy barrier for the dissociation of h@xmath0 on the mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "since dmc forces are not yet readily available , the strategy has been to first perform dft calculations to determine the geometries of the problem : i ) the initial state ( is ) with the h@xmath0 molecule in vacuum plus the clean mg(0001 ) surface , ii ) the final state ( fs ) with the two h atoms adsorbed on two nearby hollow sites , and iii ) the transition state ( ts ) determined with the neb method ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : is_ts_fs ] ) ; then , we have used these dft geometries to compute highly accurate dmc energies .",
    "dft calculations have been performed with the vasp code  @xcite , using the projector augmented method ( paw )  @xcite with the generalised gradient approximations known as pbe  @xcite , pw91  @xcite , rpbe  @xcite or the local density approximation ( lda ) . an efficient charge density extrapolation was used to speed up the calculations  @xcite .",
    "the plane - wave ( pw ) energy cut - off was 270 ev , which guarantees convergence of adsorption energies within 1 mev  @xcite .",
    "surfaces were modelled using periodic slabs , with 5 atomic layers and a vacuum thickness of 10   .",
    "the topmost three atomic layers were allowed to relax , while the bottom two were held fixed to the positions of bulk mg .",
    "the @xmath4 ratio and the lattice parameter were fixed at 1.621 and 3.2   respectively , which are close to the calculated pbe values at zero pressure and zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "we used 2x2 surface unit cells ( 22 atoms ) , with 9x9x1 * k*-point grids .",
    "these settings were extensively tested ( repeating calculations on 3x3 surface unit cells and , separately , denser * k*-point grids ) and guarantee convergence of activation energies to better than 0.02 ev  @xcite .",
    "activation energies have been calculated with the neb method  @xcite using 9 replicas , and tested with calculations using 17 replicas ; 9 replicas proved to be sufficient to reach convergence of activation energies to better than 0.01 ev and display all the main features of the minimum energy path .",
    "dmc calculations have been performed using the casino code  @xcite , employing trial wavefunctions of the slater - jastrow type : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are slater determinants of up- and down - spin single - electron orbitals .",
    "the jastrow factor @xmath8 is the exponential of a sum of one - body ( electron - nucleus ) , two - body ( electron - electron ) and three body ( electron - electron - nucleus ) terms , which are parametrised functions of electron - nucleus , electron - electron and electron - electron - nucleus separations , and are designed to satisfy the cusp conditions .",
    "the parameters in the jastrow factor are varied to minimise the variance of the local energy @xmath9 .",
    "imaginary time evolution of the schrdinger equation has been performed with the usual short time approximation , and the locality approximation  @xcite .",
    "we extensively tested time step errors in our previous work on mgh@xmath0  @xcite , and used here a time step of 0.05 a.u . , which results in essentially negligible energy biases .",
    "we used dirac - fock pseudopotentials ( pp ) for mg and h  @xcite .",
    "the mg pp has a frozen ne core and a core radius of 1.43   , the h pp has a core radius of 0.26   .",
    "the single particle orbitals have been obtained by dft - pw calculations with the the lda and a pw cutoff of 3400 ev , using the pwscf package  @xcite , and re - expanded in terms of b - splines  @xcite , using the natural b - spline grid spacing given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the length of the largest pw .",

    "this also indicates that the geometries obtained with the 4 different functionals very similar , and indeed this is confirmed by looking at the distances of the hydrogen atoms from the surface at the ts and at the fs ( see table  [ table1 ] ) . in table",

    "these large calculations were performed to investigate dmc finite size errors .",
    "raw dmc energies were corrected using the difference between the lda * k*-point converged energies and the lda energies with a * k*-point sampling corresponding to the same simulation cell employed in the dmc calculations .",
    "these corrections make it easier to extrapolate the dmc results to infinite size .",
    "it was shown by drummond et al .",
    "@xcite that for calculations on 2-dimensional systems dmc energies obtained using the ewald interaction should have @xmath17 behaviour , where @xmath18 is the number of atoms ( or , more generally , electrons ) in the system .",
    "they showed that the leading error in the kinetic energy of the 2d homogeneous electron gas falls off as @xmath19 .",
    "the system studied here is a 2d slab , and we therefore follow their recommendation of assuming an error in the total energies of the slab going as @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] we show the dmc energies for the is , the ts and the fs as function of @xmath17 , and we notice that if we disregard the smallest system ( 88 atoms ) the other three sizes fit more or less on a straight line .",

    "before discussing our findings , we should point out once more that the present dmc results for the dissociation barrier are not the `` real '' dmc results for the activation barrier , because we used dft - pbe geometries for the is the ts and the fs . at present",
    "this is all we can do , because we do not have easy access to dmc forces , however , we argued that the similarity of the geometries found with the 4 dft functional emplyed here may suggest that these geometries are indeed reliable .",
    "the present results would suggest that rpbe is the best functional to calculate the dissociation energy barrier , however , for the reverse barrier this would not be the case .",
    "other related quantities are also badly calculated with rpbe , like the enthalpy of formation of mgh@xmath0 from mg bulk and h@xmath0 that we find to be 0.29 ev ( this includes zero point energies ) , which is about 0.5 ev lower than the experimental value of 0.79 ev , or the dmc value of 0.85 ev  @xcite . as far as this enthalpy of formation",
    "is concerned , the rpbe is the functional which has the worse agreement with dmc among lda , pbe , pw91 and rpbe .",
    "we found in the literature two experimental values for dissociation energy barrier .",
    "the first one reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath20 1.0 ev ) refers to the recombination barrier ( which , in this particular case , is similar to the dissociation barrier ) identified with the barrier for desorption from the surface .",
    "this value was not directly measured in the thermal programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite because complete desorption spectra as function of temperature could not be taken , due to the onset of mg sublimation at @xmath20 450 k , which overlaps with the temperature at which h@xmath0 desorbs .",
    "however , it was noted that the onset of h@xmath0 desorption appears at 425 k , which is similar to that of the h / be(0001 ) system that has a determined desorption energy of @xmath20 1 ev  @xcite , and so , by analogy , it was suggested that the activation energy for desorption might be the same on the h / mg(0001 ) system too .    the second , and most recent",
    "one , refers to the dissociation of h@xmath0 on a 400    thick magnesium film , and has a reported value for the dissociation barrier of 0.75@xmath210.15 ev  @xcite .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the calculated pbe dissociation energy , but is significantly lower than the present dmc dissociation energy , even if a correction of  0.08 ev is applied to take zero point effects into account ( see vegge  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the experimental situation may not be the same as the theoretical ones , due to the possible presence of steps on the surface which might be more reactive sites and lower the h@xmath0 dissociation barrier .",
    "we investigated possible effects due to the presence of steps , and we found that the energy barrier is hardly affected by steps on the mg(0001 ) surface , so this might not be the reason for the apperent higher activity inferred from these experimental data .",
    "we speculate that a more likely reason might be the following .",
    "the experimentally inferred dissociation energy of 0.75@xmath210.15 ev is based on the use of the arrhenius relations with assumed pre - factors of @xmath22  hz . as showed in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , these values could be underestimated by more than two orders of magnitudes because the classical prefactors do not include the enhancement due to the much larger entropy that the molecules have in vacuum .",
    "it is possible that just these prefactor enhancement could explain an activation energy up to @xmath23 ev higher , or in other words that the correct experimental number may , in fact , be 1.0@xmath210.15 ev , which would agree well with the present dmc results",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate this possiblity to confirm or otherwise this suggestion , and we plan to do this in the future .    in summary ,",
    "we have performed here dft and dmc calculations for the activation energy needed to dissociate the h@xmath0 molecule on the mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "we have shown that the four functionals employed , lda , pw91 , pbe and rpbe , all give different results , with values ranging from 0.44 to 1.07 ev .",
    "such a large variability calls into question the reliability of certain dft functionals , and makes it difficult to make choices on the functional to employ when highly accurate energy values are needed",
    ". however , we showed that the geometries of the is , ts and fs are predicted to be very similar by the 4 functionals , which therefore provides some confidence that these geometries are indeed accurate .",
    "we have then used these geometries ( the pbe ones , to be precise ) , to calculate dmc energies , and obtained a value for the activation energy for h@xmath0 dissociation of @xmath2  ev , which is close to the dft - rpbe value of 1.07 ev .",
    "the inverse barrier is calculated to be @xmath24  ev , which is at least 0.3 ev higher than any of the results obtained with the 4 dft functionals , and casts doubts on the reliability of dft adsorption energies .",
    "the computations were performed on the hector service .",
