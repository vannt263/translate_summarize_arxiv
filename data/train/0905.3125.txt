    "in the usual semiclassical description of lasers , the transition dipole is often modeled by an operator @xmath14 associated with the linear vector @xmath15 , whose interaction with a linearly - polarized electric field @xmath16 is described quantum mechanically by the dipolar hamiltonian @xmath17 . assuming furthermore that dipole coherence lifetime is much shorter than photon lifetime @xmath18 and population inversion lifetime @xmath19 ( which is indeed the case in nd - yag lasers @xcite ) , the dipolar interaction can be described by the following terms in the rate equations for the population inversion density @xmath20 and field intensity @xmath21 @xcite  : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the saturation intensity , @xmath24 the interaction cross section , @xmath25 the speed of light in vacuum , and where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are assumed to be unit vectors .",

    "as regards nd - yag lasers , the latter equations are sufficient to describe satisfactorily most of the experimentally observed phenomena such as relaxation oscillations @xcite or spiking during laser turn - on @xcite .",
    "however , they do not allow an accurate description of mode coupling in a nd - yag laser cavity @xcite .      to this end , one must take into account , in addition with the two laser modes , the existence of several possible orientations for the transition dipoles . in the following model",
    ", we shall assume three possible orientations corresponding to the unitary vectors @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and associated with population inversion densities @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "the case of the @xmath1 crystal is by far the most common for nd - yag lasers . in this configuration ,",
    "the laser wave - vector @xmath55 is along the @xmath1 axis , while the laser electric field lies in the transverse plane .",
    "let us assume that the two laser modes are linearly polarized along the two following transverse unitary vectors  : @xmath56 where the coordinates are expressed in the base of the crystallographic axes .",
    "although this orthogonal base of the transverse plane has been arbitrarily chosen , it should be pointed out that this choice does not affect the final expression for the coupling constant ( calculation shown in the appendix ) .",
    "differently speaking , the coupling constant is independent , in the @xmath1 case , of the crystal orientation . following the authors of @xcite",

    "we now turn to the description of our experimental setup , sketched in figure  [ figure 0 ] .",
    "we use a 18-cm - long linear laser cavity with a 2.5-cm - long nd - yag crystal as a gain medium .",
    "the cavity also contains a 10-mm - long uniaxial birefringent crystal ( yvo@xmath81 ) cut at 45  deg of its optical axis , in order to spatially separate the two orthogonal modes of the cavity .",
    "we have checked that the two perpendicular ordinary and extraordinary polarizations correspond to the two spatially separated modes inside the cavity and that no significant cross - coupling inducing forked eigenstate operation @xcite was induced inside the nd - yag crystal ( which imposes a specific crystal orientation in the @xmath4 case , see further ) .",
    "we have also checked , using a fabry - perot analyzer , that each one of the two perpendicular laser modes was longitudinally single - mode .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the yvo@xmath81 crystal acts as an etalon and also due to the near - threshold operation of the laser .",
    "+ the razor blades , placed in the vicinity of the two separated beams , are intended for creating additional losses to the corresponding laser modes ( i.e. changing @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "we limit the losses introduced by the razor blade to about @xmath84 , allowing us to neglect the beam truncation and to keep a good overlap of the beams in the active medium .",
    "the intensities of the two orthogonal modes are then monitored on two photodiodes after being separated by a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "typically , the position of one razor blade is changed periodically in time ( using a piezoelectric transducer ) , and the relative dependence of @xmath38 and @xmath39 is monitored on an oscilloscope .",
    "we successively introduce razor blade losses to the @xmath85 and @xmath86 modes , thus obtaining experimental values for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the coupling constant is eventually deduced from expression ( [ def ] ) . + it is worth noticing that this result is independent , at least in the framework of our theoretical model , of most laser parameters , in particular saturation intensities @xmath41 and @xmath42 , pumping rate and calibration of photodiodes .",
    "the dominant error source in this measurement is intensity self - modulation , which introduces an uncertainty in the slope measurement .",
    "another error source is residual pumping anisotropy . in order to assess the contribution of the latter effect , we have checked experimentally that pumping light had no preferential polarization axis with an accuracy better than a few percents , resulting in a relative error of a few percents on the measurement of @xmath51 .",
    "the overall measurement error is estimated to @xmath89 .          in a first experiment",
    ", we use a typical @xmath1 nd - yag crystal as a gain medium , with arbitrary orientation .",
    "the raw output light from the fibred laser diode is focused on the crystal for optical pumping . following the method described above for the measurement of the coupling constant ,",
    "we have obtained the data reported on figure  [ figure 1 ] .",
    "this leads to the following value  : @xmath90 , in very good agreement with the previously - published value @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this agreement is probably owing to the fact that the coupling constant is relatively independent of most laser parameters , as pointed out previously , provided the two cavity modes are properly separated by the yvo@xmath81 crystal and spatial hole burning can be neglected ( which can be shown to be the case here and in the work of reference @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account this new experimental value ( with smaller error bars than in @xcite ) , the following finer estimate of the ellipticity @xmath68 can be deduced from equation ( [ cwithbeta ] )  : @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .     versus @xmath38 in the @xmath1 case when",
    "the loss rates @xmath82 ( left curve ) and @xmath83 ( right curve ) are changed .",

    "crystal ( left ) and the @xmath96 nd - yag crystal ( right ) . as can be seen on this sketch ,",
    "the yag crystal has been oriented in order to align its residual birefringence axes with the yvo@xmath81 crystal axes , in order to ensure that the cavity eigenmodes are linearly polarized along the yvo@xmath81 axes ( instead of being forked modes ) . ]    in a second experiment , the @xmath1 gain medium is replaced by a @xmath4 nd - yag crystal , manufactured by the german company fee gmbh .",
    "the crystallographic axes are known precisely by x - ray analysis .",
    "a small birefringence is observed for this crystal , probably due to mechanical stress from the mount . in order to avoid the appearance of forked modes in the laser cavity @xcite ,",
    "it is necessary to properly align the birefringence axis of the yag crystal with the ordinary and extraordinary polarization axis of the yvo@xmath81 crystal .",
    "as illustrated on figure [ figure axes ] , such a configuration is experimentally obtained , on our setup , with an angle @xmath97  deg between the crystal axes and the yvo@xmath81 axes .",
    "with such an alignment , the cavity eigenmodes are linearly polarized and coincide with the ordinary and extraordinary polarization axis of the yvo@xmath81 crystal , making the experiment suitable for comparison with our theoretical model .",
    "it is then possible to measure the coupling constant between both orthogonal modes following the previously - described method , as reported on figure  [ figure 2 ] .",
    "the result is @xmath98 , to be compared with the theoretical value predicted by our model ( equation ( [ expdecfinal ] ) with @xmath97  deg and @xmath99 ) , namely @xmath100 .",
    "this remarkable agreement is an experimental evidence for the simple theoretical description proposed in this paper .",

    "slopes measurements provide the following values  : @xmath102 ( left curve ) and @xmath103 , leading to @xmath104 . ]",
    "to summarize , we have proposed a simple yet accurate theoretical model for describing the orientation of transition dipoles in a nd - yag crystal , by making the following hypotheses  : first , dipoles are slightly elliptic ; second , their main directions are collinear with the crystallographic axes .",

    "in particular , this study is an experimental evidence for the fact that transition dipoles are indeed aligned with crystallographic axes of the nd - yag crystal , with an accuracy better than 1  deg . +",
    "the significant reduction of coupling between orthogonally polarized modes in a laser cavity using a @xmath96-cut gain medium , as demonstrated in this paper , could be used to significantly increase the stability of bi - frequency lasers , with possible applications in the field of lidar or multioscillator ring laser gyroscopes .",
