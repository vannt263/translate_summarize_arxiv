    "resonant excitation of optical antennas such as metal nanopartics / rods enhance the electromagnetic field dramatically via localized surface plasmon resonance @xcite .",
    "a single qd can experience this strong electromagnetic environment via coupling to this surface plasmon modes provided qds lie within the penetration depth of electric field of surface plasmon @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of the qds can be significantly modified by the resonant excitation of qds and metal nanoantenna @xcite .",
    "fabrication of aligned and isolated optical antenna over mono - layer qds is an important step in realization of such optical interaction .",
    "we need a high throughput and scalable technology to fabricate preferably aligned optical antenna over a compact monolayer of qds .    here ,",
    "we provide optimum physical parameters to transfer such antenna over monolayer of qds .",
    "we combine a directed self - assembly technology using langmuir - blodgett ( lb ) @xcite and controlled dip coating , a high throughput and scalable method .",
    "a controlled dip coating provides a better scheme in transferring aligned gnrs . in the dip coating process , a known concentration ,",
    "c ( mg / ml ) of ctab capped gnrs in water and a ksv mini trough ( finland ) dipper were used to insert a qd film inside the gnr solutions , waited for dip time , @xmath0 and then taken out with speed , u. we have optimized the condition for transfer of aligned gnrs from water .",
    "the parameters like dipping time ( @xmath0 ) , dipping speed ( u ) and area fraction , @xmath1 is given in the table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the dipping method imparts an overall directionality to the gnr , along the dipping direction while the density of gnrs were controlled by the dipping speed , density of gnrs solutions .",
    "recently , we have also shown long range emission enhancement @xcite due to resonant optical antenna from a mono - layer of qds . here , we demonstrate radiative decay rates enhancements from a mono layer of qds due to isolated and aligned optical antenna .",
    "we have performed extensive finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) calculations for decay rates enhancements of a dipole emitter as a function of separation from both resonant and non resonant antenna .    to prepare a monolayer of cdse quantum dots ( qds ) , we synthesized cdse qds of mean core diameter of 10 nm ( fig .",

    "gold nanorods ( gnrs ) of aspect ratios ( ar ) 2 and 3 , hereafter , referred as ar2 and ar3 respectively were chemically synthesized using methods as described earlier @xcite . the shape and size of gnr",

    "the concentrations of gnr in water was determined from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy ( icp - oes ) ( perkin - elmer ) .",
    "the uv visible absorption data were used to estimate the concentration of gnrs in a diluted solution .",
    "the absorption spectra of thin film of gnrs with ar2 and ar3 are shown in the fig .",
    "we can see that the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance ( lspr ) peak of ar 2 is overlapping with emission peak of cdse qds therefore , we call ar2 gnrs as resonant antenna .",
    "similarly lspr peak of ar3 gnr is not overlapping with pl of qds hence we call it off - resonant gnrs antenna .",
    "we transferred a compact lb monolayer of cdse qds and used it as substrate to transfer an aligned layer of gnr by dipping it for one minute inside a gnr solution .",
    "then it was pulled out in a controlled way using a dipper at the rate of 10 mm / min . to transfer low number density of gnr over the film , concentration of gnrs in the solution",
    "was intentionally kept low ( @xmath12 0.01 mg /ml ) .",
    "the film was then dried in vacuum for 12 hrs .",
    "transfer and orientation of rods along the dipping direction was confirmed by afm .",
    "the typical ratio of gnr : qd was found to be 1:800 .",
    "table 1 shows different set of physical parameters for aligned and isolated gnr antenna transfer .",

    "the * p * excitation at 630 nm excites lspr of ar2 antenna . to extract the life time of excitons in the hybrid of qds and gnr antenna for both in film and solution ,",
    "we fitted the decay curve using mostly double or three exponential equation if the fitting is not good using the equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are offset ( shift ) values in time ( t ) and intensity ( i ) in the data ; @xmath17 are pre - exponential factors , @xmath18 are three components of exciton life time .",

    "the total decay rate , @xmath21 for a qd in excited state from the hybrid monolayer can be written in terms of radiative decay rate , @xmath22 and non - radiative decay rate @xmath23 as @xmath24 and @xmath25 . knowing the quantum yield ( qy ) ( 10% ) of the qds we calculated the radiative decay rate using the relation : qy = @xmath26 . here",
    ", we measured the qy in toluene and assumed that it is same for qds transferred onto the substrates .",

    "[ filmfitpar_tab ] .",
    "although the difference between the mean lifetimes of the qds in solution under * p * and * s * excitation , in each hybrid ( a1 or a2 ) , is not significantly large yet it is non zero . this might be due to random motion of gnrs and qds in the solution .",
    "we have also calculated anisotropy in life time defined as , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the average pl life time of cdse qds in the hybrid assemblies under * p * and * s * excitation using 630 nm laser respectively .",
    "further , from the table .  [ filmfitpar_tab ] we can see that the anisotropy induced in the a1 hybrid for the solution is 3 fold larger than the bare cdse qds solution .",
    "this suggests that anisotropy in life time is introduced due to interaction of plasmonic field with qds .",

    "further , we observed a two fold enhancement of the radiative decay rate .",
    "again we observed clear spectral effect in the lifetime anisotropy for a1 samples ( resonant excitation ) . despite the fact that lifetime measurements have been done with a broad beam and hence the",
    "over all orientation alignment of gnr within the illuminated area being much smaller it is clear that the samples ( a1 ) shows higher lifetime anisotropy than the intrinsic anisotropy of the qds monolayer as shown in table [ filmfitpar_tab ] .",
    "however , we believe the anisotropy with 633 nm excitation would be stronger if a much smaller illuminated area and high density aligned nanorods antenna are used .",
