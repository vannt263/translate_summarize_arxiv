    "the concept of _ substructure _ ( or _ pattern _ ) within a _ combinatorial structure _ is an essential notion in combinatorics , whose study has had many developments in various branches of discrete mathematics . among them , the research on permutation patterns and pattern - avoiding permutations  starting in the seventies with the work of knuth  @xcite  has become a very active field .",
    "nowadays , the research on permutation patterns is being developed in several directions .",
    "one of them is to define and study analogues of the concept of pattern in permutations in other combinatorial objects such as set partitions  @xcite , words  @xcite , trees  @xcite , and paths  @xcite .",
    "the work presented here goes into this direction , and is specifically interested in patterns in polyominoes .",
    "polyominoes are discrete objects among the most studied in combinatorics , especially from an enumerative point of view . indeed , their enumeration ( w.r.t .",
    "the area or the semi - perimeter ) is a difficult problem , and is still open . in order to probe further into their study ,",
    "a large part of the research on polyominoes consists in studying restricted families of polyominoes  defined by imposing geometrical constraints , such convexity and directedness , see  @xcite .",
    "our work provides a general framework to define such families of polyominoes , by the avoidance of patterns .",
    "both permutations and polyominoes may be represented in a natural way by ( restricted ) binary matrices , and it is on this simple fact that we will build our notion of pattern in a polyomino . doing so , we have also been led to consider families of permutations and polyominoes that are defined by the avoidance of some patterns that are not themselves permutations or polyominoes , but rather less restricted binary matrices .",
    "in addition to this being an original way to look at restricted families of polyominoes , we believe it also brings new ideas to the research on permutation patterns .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : def_classes ] , we recall the definitions of permutation patterns and permutation classes , define polyomino classes , and describe some of their basic properties . more details about permutations and patterns may be found in  @xcite , and we refer the reader to  @xcite for the basic definitions on polyominoes .",
    "section  [ sec : excluded_submatrices ] introduces submatrix - avoidance in permutations and polyominoes , and examines how a permutation or polyomino class may be characterized by the avoidance of submatrices , defining several notions of _ matrix - bases _ of classes .",
    "section  [ sec : from_one_basis_to_another ] investigates how these matrix - bases are related to the usual basis of a permutation class ( and its analogue for a polyomino class ) . in sections  [ sec : known_classes_perm ] and",
    "[ sec : known_classes_poly ] , we provide several examples of permutation and polyomino classes , both previously studied and new , that can be studied with our submatrix - avoidance approach .",
    "finally , we open directions for future work in section  [ sec : further_research ] .",
    "for any integer @xmath0 , let us denote by @xmath1 the set of all permutations of the set @xmath2 .",
    "the integer @xmath0 is called the _ size _ of a permutation in @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the set of all permutations .",
    "we write permutations in one - line notation @xmath4 , meaning for instance that @xmath5 is the permutation of @xmath6 such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  , @xmath9 .",
    "given two permutations @xmath4 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a _ pattern _ of @xmath12 ( denoted @xmath13 ) when there exist indices @xmath14 such that the sequence @xmath15 is order - isomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "such sequences @xmath15 are called _ occurrences _ of @xmath11 in @xmath12 . [ def : permutation_pattern ]    a permutation @xmath11 which is a pattern of a permutation @xmath12 is said to be _ contained _ or _ involved _ in @xmath12 .",
    "a permutation @xmath12 that does not contain @xmath11 is said to _ avoid _ @xmath11 .",
    "the relation @xmath16 is a partial order on the set @xmath17 of all permutations .",
    "moreover , properties of the poset @xmath18 have been described in the literature  @xcite and we recall some of the most well - known here : @xmath18 is a well - founded poset ( it does not contain infinite descending chains ) , but it is not well - ordered , since it contains infinite _ antichains _ ( infinite sets of pairwise incomparable elements ) ; moreover , it is a graded poset ( the rank function being the size of the permutations ) .    a _ permutation class _ ( sometimes called _ pattern class _ or _ class _ for short ) is a set of permutations @xmath19that is downward closed for @xmath16 : for all @xmath20 , if @xmath13 , then @xmath21 .",
    "[ def : permutation_class ]    permutation classes are then just _ order ideals _ in the poset @xmath18 . in this article",
    ", we will also consider order ideals in other posets , and we will call them _ classes _ as well .",
    "this choice in the terminology , which could be surprising to a reader more familiar with poset theory , is in accordance with the huge literature on permutation classes , where we took the motivations for our work .    for any set @xmath22 of permutations , denoting @xmath23 the set of all permutations that avoid every pattern in @xmath22",
    ", we clearly have that @xmath23 is a permutation class .",
    "the converse statement is also true .",
    "namely :    for every permutation class @xmath19 , there is a unique antichain @xmath22 such that @xmath24 .",

    ", we shall rather call @xmath22 the _ permutation - basis _ ( or _ @xmath25-basis _ for short ) , to distinguish from other kinds of bases that we introduce in section  [ sec : excluded_submatrices ] .",
    "proposition  [ prop : perm_basis ] is a classical fact in the permutation pattern field ; for a proof , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "notice that because @xmath18 contains infinite antichains , the @xmath25-basis of a permutation class may be infinite .",
    "actually , proposition  [ prop : perm_basis ] does not hold only for permutation classes , but for downward closed sets in any _ well - founded poset _ , _",
    "i.e. _ partially ordered set that do not contain infinite descending chains .",
    "let @xmath26 be a well - founded poset .",
    "for any subset @xmath27 of @xmath28 that is downward closed for @xmath29 , there exists a unique antichain @xmath22 of @xmath28 such that @xmath30 for all @xmath31 does not hold@xmath32 .",

    "let us define @xmath22 to be the set of minimal elements of @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",
    "this is equivalent to characterizing @xmath22 as the set of minimal elements of @xmath28 ( in the sense of @xmath29 ) that do not belong to @xmath19 . because @xmath28 is well - founded , we have that @xmath35 if and only if @xmath36 such that @xmath37 . the contrapositive gives @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , by minimality , the elements of @xmath22 are pairwise incomparable , so that @xmath22 is indeed an antichain .    to ensure uniqueness , it is enough to notice that for two different antichains @xmath22 and @xmath39 the sets @xmath38 and @xmath40 are also different .",
    "permutations are in ( obvious ) bijection with permutation matrices , ( necessarily square ) binary matrices with exactly one entry @xmath41 in each row and in each column . to any permutation @xmath12 of @xmath1 , we may associate a permutation matrix @xmath42 of dimension @xmath0 by setting @xmath43 if @xmath44 , and @xmath45 otherwise . throughout this work",
    "we adopt the convention that rows of matrices are numbered from bottom to top , so that the @xmath41 in @xmath42 are at the same positions than the dots in the diagram of @xmath12  see an example on figure  [ fig : perm - matrix_diagram ] .     graphical representation ( or diagram ) of the permutation @xmath46 . @xmath47",

    "it follows from identifying permutations with the corresponding permutation matrices that we may rephrase the definition of permutation classes as follows : a set @xmath19of permutations is a class if and only if , for every @xmath20 , every submatrix of @xmath42 which is a permutation is in @xmath19 .",
    "this does not say much by itself , but it allows to define analogues of permutation classes for other combinatorial objects that are naturally represented by matrices , like polyominoes .",
    "a polyomino is a finite union of cells ( unit squares in the plane @xmath54 ) that is connected and has no cut point ( _ i.e. _ the set of cells has to be connected according to the edge adjacency ) .",

    "we point out that the order @xmath62 has already been studied in  @xcite under the name of _ subpicture order_. the main point of focus of  @xcite is the family of _ @xmath63-convex polyominoes _ defined by the same authors in  @xcite .",
    "but  @xcite also proves that @xmath62 is not a partial well - order , since @xmath59 contains infinite antichains .",
    "remark also that @xmath59 is a graded poset ( the rank function being the semi - perimeter of the bounding box of the polyominoes ) .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath59 is well - founded .",
    "notice that these properties are shared with the poset @xmath18 of permutations .",
    "a natural analogue of permutation classes for polyominoes is as follows :    a _ polyomino class _ is a set of polyominoes @xmath19that is downward closed for @xmath62 : for all polyominoes @xmath55 and @xmath60 , if @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then @xmath66 .",

    "conversely , we may ask how to transform the @xmath25-basis into an `` efficient '' @xmath97-basis . of course , the @xmath25-basis is itself an @xmath97-basis , but we may wish to describe the canonical one , or a minimal one .",
    "many questions may also be asked about the canonical and minimal @xmath97-bases themselves .",
    "for instance : when does a class have a unique minimal @xmath97-basis ? which elements of the canonical @xmath97-basis may belong to a minimal @xmath97-basis ? may we describe ( or compute ) the minimal @xmath97-bases from the canonical @xmath97-basis ?    finally , we can study the classes for which the @xmath25-basis is itself a minimal @xmath97-basis of the class ( see the examples of the polyomino classes of vertical bars , or of parallelogram polyominoes ) .",
    "submatrix avoidance in permutation classes has allowed us to derive a statement ( corollary  [ cor : we ] ) from which infinitely many wilf - equivalences follow .",
    "such general results on wilf - equivalences are rare in the permutation patterns literature , and it would be interesting to explore how much further we can go in the study of wilf - equivalences with the submatrix avoidance approach .",
    "one is a systematic study of polyomino classes defined by pattern avoidance .",
    "because enumeration is the biggest open question about polyominoes , we should study the enumeration of such classes , and see whether some interesting bounds can be provided .",
    "notice that the stanley - wilf - marcus - tardos theorem  @xcite on permutation classes implies that the permutations in any given class represent a negligible proportion of all permutations .",
    "we do nt know if a similar statement holds for polyomino classes .    as we have reported in section  [ sec : papc ] , the poset @xmath366 of polyominoes was introduced in @xcite , where the authors proved that it is a ranked poset , and contains infinite antichains .",
    "there are however some combinatorial and algebraic properties of this poset which are still to explore , in particular w.r.t . characterizing some simple intervals in this poset .",
    "finally , we have used binary matrices to import some questions on permutation classes to the context of polyominoes . but a similar approach could be applied to any other family of combinatorial objects which are represented by binary matrices .      we would like to thank valentin fray , samanta socci and laurent vuillon for helpful discussions on the topics of this paper .",
    "many thanks also to the anonymous referee for carefully reading our work , and for pointing out some inaccuracies that have now been fixed .",
