    "the realization of majorana states as specific excitations of semiconductor quantum wires and of other condensed matter systems has attracted much interest recently.@xcite experimental evidences of these peculiar states in quantum wires and topological insulators have been presented in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] , respectively .",
    "to assess these evidences , theoretical works are presently focussing on a deeper clarification of the physical properties of majorana states , including analysis of stability limitations and robustness against disorder and other perturbations.@xcite    as most characteristic properties , a majorana state is a zero - energy mode , thus degenerate with the system ground state , that is localized on the system edges or interfaces .",
    "additionally , an energy gap with neighboring states protects the majorana modes against decoherence . in semiconductor wires , the subject of this work ,",
    "such zero - energy modes can be induced by the combined action of the following three mechanisms : superconductivity , rashba spin - orbit coupling and zeeman magnetic field .",
    "superconductivity introduces particle - hole duality , with excitations lying symmetrically at positive and negative energies with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "rashba spin - orbit coupling introduces helicity by associating motion in space with spin .",
    "thirdly , the zeeman coupling with an applied magnetic field can be viewed as a tunable interaction with which the system can be placed in different regimes .",
    "the edge character of the majorana modes suggests a link with the physics of surfaces .",
    "indeed , the similarities with the schockley states of finite crystals @xcite have been pointed out in ref .",
    "we explore in this work another link with surface physics , namely the description of majorana modes using the complex band structure of the system .",
    "the complex band structure of crystals ( or periodic systems in general ) is a well established theoretical formalism allowing the generalization from bulk propagating states to states that are localized around defects or interfaces of the crystal.@xcite the underlying idea of the generalization is the following : while usual propagating states are described by sustained waves with a real wave number @xmath0 , there are other solutions with complex wave numbers representing evanescent waves whose amplitude decreases in a given direction ( increases in the reversed one ) .    waves with complex @xmath0 can not be physically realized for infinitely long distances from a given point in both directions due to the divergent behavior in one of them ; but they can in a finite domain , or even in a semi - infinite one provided the infinite distance is in the direction of decaying amplitude .",
    "the latter situation is precisely the one we expect for edge majorana modes .",
    "while for propagating states the analysis is usually done in terms of the band structure @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the band index and @xmath0 is an arbitrary real wave number , the complex band structure is presented as @xmath3 , where for any given energy @xmath4 there is a set of allowed complex wave numbers @xmath5 .",
    "of course , if the energy does not allow propagating states all @xmath6 will have an imaginary part .",
    "in general , however , propagating and evanescent modes may coexist .    in this work",
    "we determine numerically the complex band structure of a semiconductor quantum wire with the above mentioned interactions .",
    "previously,@xcite we studied the complex band structure in absence of superconductivity and zeeman field .",
    "our present numerical approach to majorana physics complements the analytical methods used in ref .",
    "we suggest robust numerical algorithms to obtain the complex band structure of 1d and 2d quantum wires in general , discussing the conditions for the existence of majorana modes in the semi - infinite system . in 2d",
    "we focus on the role of the rashba mixing , giving evidence that the rashba mixing mechanism hinders the coexistence of two majorana modes .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of numerical diagonalizations for the finite system.@xcite our results correspond to a continuum hamiltonian of quantum wires and , from this point of view , they also complement approaches based on tight binding models.@xcite    the analysis in terms of the complex band structure gives the precise conditions for the existence of zero - energy edge modes , as an alternative to the analysis based on propagating bands . in particular , it clarifies why the topological phase transition from absence to presence of a majorana mode is signaled by the vanishing and reopening of the gap for propagating states with @xmath7 , as discussed in ref .",
    "sections ii and iii are devoted to the 1d and 2d cases , respectively .",
    "the first one is meant as a simple yet illustrative case of the more realistic situation including transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "being well understood,@xcite the 1d system serves as a benchmark of the complex band structure method .",

    "the system exhibits very different physics depending on the field orientation . in 1d the rashba term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is defining a preferred spin direction ( @xmath16 ) so that , in abscence of any orbital effects , the physics depends on the field orientation relative to this rashba - induced direction . since field orientations along @xmath8 and @xmath17 are equivalent we will then consider a field lying on the @xmath18 plane , with an azimuthal angle @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the two limiting cases are the parallel ( @xmath21 ) and transverse ( @xmath22 ) orientations with respect to the wire .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",

    "we will focus next on the description of edge states , in particular zero energy ones representing majorana modes .",
    "the complex band structure contains the necessary information on all possible eigenstates . in particular , localized states for which the wave function fades away of some defect or interface",
    "are , in general , superpositions of evanescent states .",
    "let us consider a semi - infinite 1d system restricted to @xmath55 .",
    "a priori , we expect the abrupt edge at @xmath56 to allow the formation of localized states vanishing at @xmath56 and decaying towards @xmath57 .",
    "such a state has to be a superposition of evanescent waves having @xmath58 .",
    "let us assume that the set of such wave numbers is @xmath59 , containing @xmath60 modes for a given energy @xmath4 .",

    "( [ eq12 ] ) as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the determinant has a discontinuous behavior : it decays from its maximal value for @xmath76 ; it has an accidental zero for @xmath77 , when all wave numbers in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] show that majorana modes exist above a critical field ( @xmath80 in that case ) which is in agreement with the @xmath81 of eq .",

    "( [ fig3 ] ) the complete vanishing of @xmath0 for two of the modes indicates that they loose the evanescent character and become propagating , but only for a single point in @xmath12 and thus they are not seen in panel a ) as fully developed bands . at this value of @xmath12 , therefore , there is no energy gap for propagating states .",
    "notice , finally , that fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] also shows that the vanishing of the gap for propagating states occurs for a wave number @xmath7 .",

    "we consider now the generalization of the complex band structure approach to include one extra spatial degree of freedom in the transverse direction to the wire . as before , we assume the wire to be infinite along @xmath8 , but now motion along @xmath16 is also possible with the restriction @xmath85 .",
    "this corresponds to a hard wall confinement in @xmath16 within a square well of length @xmath86 .",
    "we call this a 2d case although in the literature the name quasi-1d is often used to emphasize that there is confinement in the transverse direction while along the longitudinal one motion is free",

    "the _ mixing _ character of this term can be understood from the fact that the @xmath89 operator couples different square well eigenstates .",
