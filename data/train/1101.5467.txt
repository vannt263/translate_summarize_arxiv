    "quantum charge pumping , a coherent quantum transport process that generates steady charge currents of electrons through adiabatically and periodically time - varying potentials , is a standard method for the charge transport in solid state circuits @xcite . in the quantized charge transport ,",
    "the number of particles pumped out during each cycle of the potential modulation is an integer and can be understood using a berry phase @xcite .",
    "because of the precise control on the amount of pumped charges at the single electron level , the quantum charge pumping has found important applications in many electronic devices @xcite .",
    "it also provides a solid foundation to the modern theory of electric polarization @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have also been extended to another degree of freedom of electrons , the spin , leading to the quantum spin pumping that plays a crucial role in spintronics spinpump1,spinpump2,spinpump3 . however , the exact quantized charge transport is usually difficult to observe in experiments because of unavoidable complexity due to impurities , disorder and interactions in the solid .    in view of the significance of electronics and spintronics ,",
    "there has been a great deal of interest recently for developing a one - to - one analog of complex and interesting electronic materials , circuits , and devices using ultra - cold neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "this field , known as atomtronics , is a significant extension of the recent great efforts on emulating condensed matter physics using ultra - cold atoms ole1,ole2,ole3 .",
    "important concepts such as atomic batteries , diodes , and transistors , have been proposed recently for atomtronics .",
    "it would be natural and also important to investigate the coherent quantum transport process of cold atoms in optical lattices , which is an important element of atomtronic devices .",
    "a straightforward method for the transport , of course , is by applying an external force .",
    "however , using external forces not only involves the acceleration of atoms that may change the motional states of atoms , but also may be limited by the bloch oscillation of atoms in optical lattices .",
    "recently , a lot of attention has been focused on the quantum transport of atoms in optical lattices without involving external forces @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed that quantum transport of atoms may be achieved in optical double well lattices through the fast periodic modulation ( in a non - adiabatic manner ) of the inter- and intra - well tunnelings @xcite**. * * it was also proposed creffield that a fast oscillating linear potential in optical lattices can yield the quantum ratchet effect due to coherent destruction of tunneling @xcite , leading to quantum transport of atoms .",
    "however , all these schemes require accurate control of the lattice parameters and their time variation .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quantum transport of ultra - cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices without involving the accurate control of the lattice parameters and their time dependence .",
    "we consider atoms that are initially prepared in certain region of a double well optical lattice doublewell1,doublewell2,doublewell3,doublewell4,doublewell5,doublewell6 , doublewell7,doublewell8,doublewell9,rousseau , schlagheck .",
    "we show that quantized number of atoms can be transferred to another region of the lattice through periodic and slow modulation of the optical lattice parameters ( intra- and inter - well tunneling , chemical potential , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "such quantized atom pumping may serve as a quantum atom battery for atomtronic devices .",
    "note that there is an important difference between the atom transport in optical lattices and the charge transport in the solid . while the electrons in the solid are fermions , cold atoms in optical lattices can be bosons , therefore the bose - einstein statistics , instead of the fermi - dirac statistics , governs the transport dynamics .",
    "this important difference will be illustrated in this paper**. * * another important difference is that while electrons are periodically distributed in crystals , the density distribution of atoms can be prepared locally in the optical lattice and transferred to another region through the quantum transport process with the periodic modulation of the lattice parameters .",
    "we emphasize that although the periodic modulation of the lattice parameters in the parameter space are needed in the transport process , the rate of change of the parameters , the initial and final values of each parameter during its variation do not need to be accurately controlled .",
    "this is because the transport process depends on the topology of the loop in the parameter space , instead of the exact parameter loop or the rate of change of the parameters along the loop .",
    "therefore the quantum transport process is very robust against errors in the parameter modulation .",
    "we find the transport of bosonic atoms depends strongly on the atom filling per double well as well as the interaction .",
    "the strongly interacting bosonic atoms behave similarly as the non - interacting fermions with quantized transport at the half filling and no mass transport at the integer filling . in the weakly interacting region ,",
    "the number of transported atoms is proportional to the atom filling .",
    "the investigation is based on the numerical simulation of the exact quantum dynamics of cold atoms in double well optical lattices using the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the transport properties observed in the numerical simulation are also understood by developing an analytical theory using a semiclassical transport model in the non - interacting and strongly interacting limits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the physical system : the cold bosonic atoms in a double well optical lattice .",
    "section iii presents the numerical results on the transport of bosonic atoms in the optical lattices through the periodic modulation the lattice parameters . in section iv",
    ", we provide a semiclassical transport model to explain the numerically observed transport of bosonic cold atoms in the non - interacting and strongly interacting limits .",

    "initially , the bosonic atoms are confined within a group of lattice sites ( denoted as region a ) using a harmonic or box trapping potential @xcite , which will be removed after the transport starts .",
    "the transport is realized by moving the atoms in the region a to another group of lattice sites ( denoted as region b ) by modulating the lattice parameters periodically , but without the actual movement of the lattice .",

    "two different loops ( square and elliptical ) are considered and their effects will be discussed later in the paper .",
    "we choose the rate of the change of the parameters @xmath27 such that the tunneling process is adiabatic in each double well and the atoms always stay on the ground state of the double well . during the whole transport process",

    "physically , the numerical results obtained in the above section at the half filling may be understood through the change of the wannier function of bosons in a periodic lattice due to the modulation of the lattice parameters .",
    "the center of the wannier function follows the potential minimum of the double well , and can move from one double well to the neighboring one in one cycle . in this section , we present a semiclassical theory for the quantum transport of the non - interacting bosons in the double well lattice to understand the numerical results observed in the above section . on the other hand ,",

    "this result agrees with the numerical results presented in fig .",
    ".    finally , we comment on the validity of using the periodic boundary condition in the semiclassical theory for the explanation of the numerical results observed in sec .",
    "( [ ham4 ] , [ energy ] , [ tranatom2 ] ) are introduced by assuming a periodic boundary condition for a single atom and the fact that the atom occupies the bloch eigenstate . in general , the periodic system is not equivalent to our system where the atoms are initially localized . however , because the initial state we choose is the product of the state in each isolated double well ( no inter - well tunneling ) , and the atoms at different double wells do not affect each other ( no interaction ) , the periodic system can be taken as a multiply copies of our local system .",
    "therefore the effect of the quantum transport and the essential physics should be the same for the periodic system and our local system , which justify the agreement between the semiclassical theory and the numerical results .",
    "the difference between these two systems is that , in a periodic system , the change of the local atom density after a period can not be observed because it is periodic .",
