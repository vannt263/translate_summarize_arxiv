    "extreme value statistics @xcite is a well established approach to predict the relative frequency of rare extreme events , but does not include forecasts of when the next event will occur .",
    "there have been many attempts to employ time series strategies for the latter purpose .",
    "these strategies usually investigate a record of historical data about the phenomenon under study and try to infer knowledge about the future .",
    "a standard approach is to search for precursors , i.e. , typical signatures preceeding an extreme event .",
    "such precursors have been discussed , e.g. , in the literature about earthquakes @xcite , epileptic seizures @xcite , and stock market crashes @xcite . as the above listed examples illustrate , the definitions of what an extreme event is depends on the context .",
    "frequently , one encounters extremely large values of some observable , or some drastic changes .",
    "it is the latter which is the focus of this paper where we discuss large increments motivated by stock markets or by turbulent gust in wind speed data .",
    "one might expect that the more extreme an event is , the more difficult it is to predict it , simply because more extreme events are usually also much rarer .",
    "however , it has been reported in the literature of wind speed predictions @xcite , precipitation forecast @xcite , multi agent games @xcite and earthquakes @xcite that more extreme events are better predictable than small events .",
    "therefore one particular goal of this contribution is to investigate how the predictability of large increments depends on the size of the increment .    in this contribution",
    "we study predictions in a simple autoregressive process of order 1 ( ar(1 ) process ) @xcite analytically in order to obtain a detailed understanding of some questions on precursors and predictions .",
    "the ar(1 ) process is a simple stationary stochastic model process , that might not reflect all features of more complex processes occurring in nature , but it admits a fully analytic treatment .",
    "additionally , we study similar prediction procedures numerically in long - range correlated data and in wind speed data , verifying the same quantitative results .",
    "the questions , which we intend to answer are the following :    * how to choose a precursor in order to obtain good predictions ? * are extreme increments the better predictable , the more extreme they are ? * how does the correlation of the data influence the predictability of extreme increments ?    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ pre ] we discuss two strategies which can be used to choose precursory structures and in sec .  [ roc ] we introduce a method to evaluate the predictive power of precursors .",
    "the extreme events we dicuss in this contribution are defined in sec .",
    "[ def ] and we show how to obtain their joint pdfs analytically in sec .",
    "[ tfilter ] .",
    "we apply these procedures to ar(1 ) correlated stochastic processes in sec .",

    "conclusions appear in sec .",
    "the considerations in this introductory section are made for general dynamical systems with a complex time evolution .",
    "they might be purely deterministic , then high - dimensional and chaotic , or they might be stochastic . in any case",
    "we assume that the time evolution of the system can not be easily modeled and hence one tries to extract information about the future from time series data .",
    "this means that through some experimental observation one can record a usually univariate time series , i.e. , a set of measurements @xmath0 at discrete times @xmath1 , where @xmath2 with a sampling interval @xmath3 .",
    "the recording should contain sufficiently many extreme events so that we are able to extract statistical information about them .",
    "we also assume that the event of interest can be identified on the basis of the observations , e.g. , by the value of the observation function exceeding some threshold , by a sudden increase , or by its variance exceeding again some threshold .      ideally , a precursor is a typical signature in the data preceeding _ every _ individual event .",
    "unfortunately the time evolution of most systems is usually too irregular to demand this , so one would call a precursor a data structure which is _ typically _ preceeding an event , allowing deviations from the given structure , but also allowing events without preceeding structure .",
    "this interpretation of a precursor allows to determine the specific values of the precursory structure by statistical considerations .    in order to predict an event occurring at the time @xmath4 we compare",
    "the last @xmath5 observations @xmath6 with a specific precursory structure @xmath7 .",
    "this precursory structure can be chosen according to different strategies .",
    "the two possible strategies which we address here , represent the most fundamental choices .",
    "they consist in using either the maximum of the _ a posteriori pdf _ or of the maximum of the _ likelihood _ @xcite . in more applied examples",
    "one looks for precursors which minimize or maximize more sophisticated quantities , e.g. , discriminant functions or loss matrices .",
    "these quantities are usually functions of the posterior pdf or the likelihood , but they take into account the additional demands of the specific problem , e.g. , minimizing the loss due to a false prediction @xcite .",
    "the two strategies studied in this contribution are thus fundamental in the sense that they enter into most of the more sophisticated quantities which are used for predictions and decision making .",
    "the a posteriori pdf @xmath8 takes into account all events of size @xmath9 and provides the probability density to find a specific precursory structure before an observed event .    *",
    "hence strategy i consists in defining the precursors in a retrospective or _ a posteriori _ way : once the extreme event @xmath9 has been identified , one asks for the signals right before it .",
    "formally , this implies that the precursory structure consists of the global maxima in each component @xmath10 of the a posteriori pdf .",
    "the likelihood @xmath11 takes into account all possible values of precursory structures , and provides the probability density that an event of size x will follow them .",
    "note that the likelihood is thus not a density function with respect to the precursory structure , but with respect to the event size x. the precursory structure enters into the likelihood only as a parameter .",
    "* strategy ii consists in determining those values of each component @xmath12 of the condition @xmath13 for which the likelihood has a global maximum .",
    "note that the a posterior pdf and the likelihood are linked via bayes s theorem @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the marginal pdf to find the precursory structure @xmath13 and @xmath16 represents the marginal pdf to find events of size x.    in summary the possible values of precursors are given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the points in which @xmath8 has a global maximum and @xmath19 are the points in which @xmath11 has its largest maximum , with @xmath20 . in both cases the event size @xmath9 is assumed to be fixed .",
    "once the precursory structure @xmath21 is determined , we give an alarm for an extreme event when we find the last @xmath5 observations @xmath13 in the volume    @xmath22    this method of determining the precursor is especially useful if the pdf of a process has one clearly defined maximum . for multimodal",
    "pdfs the strategy of using only the global maxima can surely be improved by considering also the influence of smaller maxima of the pdf . in this case",
    "the precursory volume could , e.g. , consist of @xmath13 for which the pdfs have values above a certain threshold . in this case",
    "@xmath23 might not be simple connected , but apart from this the procedure of predicting should not be different",
    ". however , we restrict ourselves to unimodal pdfs in this contribution .      a common method to verify a hypothesis or test the quality of a prediction is the receiver operating characteristic curve ( roc - plot ) @xcite .",
    "the idea of the roc - curve consists simply in comparing the rate of correctly predicted events @xmath24 with the rate of false alarms @xmath25 by plotting @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting curve in the unit - square of the @xmath27-@xmath26 plane approaches the origin for @xmath28 and the point @xmath29 in the limit @xmath30 , where @xmath31 accounts for the size of the precursor volume @xmath23 ( see eq .",
    "( [ vol ] ) ) .",
    "the shape of the curve characterizes the significance of the prediction .",
    "a curve above the diagonal reveals that the corresponding strategy of prediction is better than a random prediction which is characterized by the diagonal .",
    "furthermore we are interested in curves which converge as fast as possible to @xmath32 , since this scenario tells us that we reach the highest possible rate of correct prediction without having a large rate of false alarms .",
    "there are various so called _ summary indices _",
    "@xcite which quantify the behavior of the roc . in this contribution",
    "we use the so called _ likelihood ratio _ @xcite in order to quantify the roc - curve .",
    "the likelihood ratio is identical to the slope @xmath33 of the roc - curve . for the usage as a summary index , we consider the slope in the vicinity of the origin which implies @xmath34 .    the term likelihood ratio results from signal detection theory in which context the term `` a posteriori pdf '' refers to the pdf which we call likelihood in the context of predictions , and vice versa .",
    "this is due to the fact that the aim of signal detection is to identify a signal which was already observed in the past , whereas predictions are made about future events .",
    "thus the `` likelihood ratio '' is in our case in fact a ratio of the posterior pdfs , as defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the a posterior pdf for non - events .",
    "however , we will use the common name likelihood ratio throughout the text .",
    "the likelihood ratio can be expressed in terms of the likelihood @xmath37 and the total probability to find events @xmath38 @xmath39 if we assume that the events we are observing are quite rare and hence @xmath40 , the likelihood ratio is approximately given by    @xmath41    eq .",
    "[ shortm ] already suggest an answers to questions * ( q1 ) * and * ( q2 ) * , by considering @xmath42 as a summary index .",
    "* ad ( q1 ) : * this asymptotic form of the likelihood ratio allows us to compare different strategies of prediction .",
    "looking for the maximum of @xmath8 in @xmath13 , according to strategy i , there is always the influence of the denominator @xmath15 which will keep the likelihood ratio small , even if @xmath8 in @xmath13 is maximized .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath8 can not be large without @xmath15 being large .",
    "strategy ii , which uses the maximum of @xmath11 in @xmath43 should thus be superior , since the denominator @xmath16 is independent of the chosen precursor .",
    "the examples which are studied in sec .",
    "[ ar1 ] , sec .",
    "[ wind ] and sec .",
    "[ long ] support this idea .",
    "* ad ( q2 ) : * according to eq .",
    "( [ shortm ] ) , the likelihood ratio is larger than unity , if @xmath44 , i.e. , if @xmath45 and @xmath9 are correlated .",
    "this condition can be also written as @xmath46 or as @xmath47 using bayes s theorem .",
    "the latter expression states that the a posteriori pdf @xmath8 , i.e. , the probability to find the precursor prior to an event should be larger than the probability to find the precursor prior to an arbitrary value .",
    "thus , the condition is fulfilled by choosing the precursor in a reasonable way , e.g. , using the maximum of @xmath8 in @xmath13 or the maximum of @xmath8 .      in this contribution",
    "we will concentrate on extreme events which consist in a sudden increase ( or decrease ) of the observed variable within a few time steps .",
    "examples of this kind of extreme events are the increases in wind speed in @xcite , but also stock market crashes @xcite which consist in sudden decreases .",
    "we define our extreme event by an increment @xmath48 exceeding a given threshold @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the observed values at two consecutive time steps .",
    "a mathematical expression for a filter , which selects the pdf of our extreme events out of the pdfs of the underlying stochastic process can be obtained through the heaviside function @xmath53 .",
    "this filter is then applied to the joint pdf of a stochastic process .    since only the time steps @xmath54 are of relevance for the filtering , we can neglect all previous time steps and apply the filter simply to the joint pdf for @xmath54 , which has then the form @xmath55 this implies that we can regard all previous time - steps @xmath56 , on which @xmath57 and @xmath58 might depend , as parameters .",
    "the joint pdf of the extreme events @xmath59 can then be obtained by multiplication with @xmath60 . if the resulting expression is non zero , the condition of the extreme event ( [ e0 ] ) is fulfilled and for @xmath52 and @xmath51 the following relation holds : @xmath61",
    "hence it is possible to express the joint probability density in terms of @xmath51 or @xmath52 with the new random variable @xmath62 .",
    "we can then use the integral representation of the heaviside function with appropriate substitutions to obtain : @xmath63 by normalizing this expression with the total probability @xmath64 to find extreme events of size @xmath49 or larger we obtain the joint pdf @xmath65 of all values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 which are part of an extreme event . integrating the resulting joint pdf @xmath65 over @xmath52",
    "we find the following expression for the marginal distribution , i.e. , the a posteriori pdf : @xmath66 analogously @xmath67 denotes the a posteriori pdf to observe the value @xmath51 before an non - event , i.e. , before an increment which is smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath68    if for a given process the joint pdf of two consecutive events is known , we can hence analytically determine @xmath69 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
    "we assume that the time - series @xmath71 is generated by an auto - regressive model of order 1 ( ar(1 ) ) ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 are uncorrelated gaussian random numbers with unit variance and @xmath74 is a constant which represents the coupling strength .",
    "the size and the sign of the coupling strength sets whether successive values of @xmath0 are clustered or spread , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : data+ ] .",
    "in the case @xmath75 the process reduces to uncorrelated random numbers with mean @xmath76 and variance @xmath77 , whereas generally the process is exponentially correlated @xmath78 and has the marginal pdf @xmath79 since the size of the events is naturally measured in units of the standard deviation @xmath80 we introduce a new scaled variable @xmath81 .    applying the filter mechanism developed in sec .",

    ". otherwise said , this is an average of all those time series segments , which ( in shifted time ) fulfill @xmath167 , so that the part of these segments with @xmath168 is what one would call naively a precursor of a gust event .",
    "this has to be compared to the values @xmath169 which we find when we focus on the maximum @xmath88 in @xmath0 of @xmath170 which corresponds to the conditional probability @xmath171 of strategy ii .",

    "these profiles differ from the precursors shown before , as we have to expect for an ar(1)-model : in a perfect ar(1 ) process , the precursors equivalent to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : gustprofiles ] would show a jump larger than @xmath161 from @xmath174 to @xmath84 , with @xmath176 , and with @xmath177 for @xmath178 , and @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "for the same idealized process , one expects fig .",
    "[ fig : precursors2 ] to show curves given by @xmath181 for all @xmath5 .",
    "evidently , the wind data show a qualitatively very similar behavior , whereas , however , additional correlations are visible .",
    "the roc - curves for the two prediction strategies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rocwind1 ] and [ fig : rocwind2 ] .",
    "as expected , the minimization of false alarms ( strategy ii ) is here superior , as strategy i has no predictive power .",
    "the latter is consistent with the observed value @xmath160 and the results for the ar(1 ) process .    in order to compute the roc - curves we use the following numerically expensive but theoretically best justified algorithm : in theory ,",
    "we want to generate an alarm if the current observation @xmath0 lies in an interval @xmath182 which is defined by the subset of the @xmath183 where either @xmath170 or @xmath162 exceeds some threshold @xmath184 .",
    "we assume that both conditional pdfs are smooth in @xmath0 .",
    "we can locally approximate @xmath170 by searching all similar states @xmath185 , with @xmath186 and counting the relative number of events in this set of states .",
    "when this number exceeds @xmath187 , we give the alarm and can see whether it is a hit or a false alarm .    in order to evaluate @xmath162",
    "we first create the set of all states @xmath188 which are preceeding an event , and then compute the fraction of these which is @xmath189-close to the current state @xmath0 .",
    "since this fraction evidently depends on the value of @xmath189 , we should introduce a normalization .",
    "however , in order to create the roc statistics we just have to introduce a threshold which runs from 0 to the largest value thus found .",
    "both schemes can be straightforwardly generalized to situations where the current state of the process is defined by a sequence @xmath13 of @xmath5 past measurements @xmath190 , e.g. , for an ar(2 ) model @xmath191 , whereas in @xcite we were using @xmath192 for a markov chain of order 10 .",
    "since the wind speed data are strongly correlated , @xmath160 , it is not possible to predict the increments of the data sufficiently well .",
    "this corresponds to the previously derived results for the ar(1 ) model in the limit @xmath97 .",
    "however , we also find deviations from the theoretical roc - curve for @xmath164 , which is additionally plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : rocwind1 ] and [ fig : rocwind2 ] .",
    "these deviations show that the ar(1 ) model is not able to describe the wind data completely .",
    "the wind data also show the increase of predictability with increasing event size .",
    "this suggests that this effect is more general and not limited to the class of ar(1 ) models .",
    "again , we also observe that strategy ii is superior to strategy i.",
    "we studied the same questions which are described before , in long - range correlated processes . since the precursors we were interested in live on a very short time scale ( one step before the event )",
    ", one should not expect long - range correlations to lead to qualitatively different results for the aspects we were interested in .",
    "the results obtained in this section support this assumption .",
    "there are various definitions of long - range correlation .",
    "typically long - range correlation in a time series is characterized by the exponent @xmath193 of the power - law decay of the autocorrelation function as a function of the time t @xmath194 the correlation coefficient @xmath195 is controlling , how fast the correlations decay .",
    "we study the predictability of increments numerically by applying the prediction strategies described in sec .",
    "the data used for this numerical study were generated as described in @xcite and used in@xcite : imposing a power - law decay on the fourier spectrum , @xmath196 with @xmath197 and choosing phase angles at random one obtains through an inverse fourier transform the long - range correlated time series in @xmath198 with @xmath199 .",
    "the data are gaussian distributed with @xmath200 , @xmath201 .",
    "having specified the power spectrum or , correspondingly , the autocorrelation function for sequences of gaussian random numbers means to have fixed all parameters of a linear stochastic process .",
    "hence , in principle the coefficients of an autoregressive or moving average process can be uniquely determined , where , due to the power - law nature of the spectrum and autocorrelation function the order of either of these models have to be infinite @xcite .",
    "thus , the effects which we observed for this arma(@xmath202 , @xmath202 ) model should be valid for the whole class of linear long - term correlated processes .",
    "the roc - curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : longrange ] , which are generated from the long - range correlated data are very similar to the ones for the ar(1 ) process in terms of the question we want to study .",
    "* ad ( q1 ) : * the roc - curves obtained by using strategy ii are superior to the curves resulting from strategy i.    * ad ( q2 ) and ( q3 ) : * the quality of the prediction also increases with increasing event size and decreasing correlation .",
    "hence we observe the same effects which we described before for the ar(1 ) process and the wind speed data in a long range correlated arma(@xmath202 , @xmath202 ) process .",
    "we studied the predictability of extreme increments in an ar(1 ) correlated process , in wind speed data and in a long - range correlated arma process . to measure the quality of the prediction we used the roc - curve and additionally the slope of the roc - curve in the vicinity of the origin as a summary index .",
    "this so called _ likelihood ratio _ , characterizes particularly the behavior in the limit of low false - alarm rates .    in the case of the ar(1 ) process",
    "we could construct the posterior pdf and the likelihood analytically from a given joint pdf and hence we were able to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the likelihood ratio analytically . in the case of the two other examples",
    ", we constructed the posterior pdfs numerically .",
    "the resulting distributions were then used to determine precursors according to two different strategies of prediction .    in all examples we studied the aspects : * ( q1 ) * which is the best strategy to choose precursors ? * ( q2 ) * how does the predictability depend on the event size ? * ( q3 ) * and how does the predictability depend on the correlation ? the results can be summarized as follows :    * ad ( q1 ) : * strategy i , the a posteriori approach , maximizes the rate of correct predictions , while strategy ii focuses on the minimization of the rate of false alarms . for the example of the ar(1 ) process one can show that strategy ii is the optimal strategy to make predictions .",
    "for other stochastic processes , it is not in general clear which of the two strategies leads to a better predictability .",
    "however , the application to the prediction of wind speeds and the numerical study within long - range correlated data reveals that also for these examples better results are obtained by predicting according to strategy ii .    *",
    "ad ( q2 ) : * for all examples studied , we observe an increase of predictability with increasing size of the events .",
    "this phenomenon which is also reported in the literature @xcite , can be better studied by investigating the asymptotic behavior of our summary index . in the case of the ar(1 )",
    "process we showed explicitly that the likelihood ratio increases as a squared exponential with increasing event size . in sec .",
    "[ roc ] we discussed for a general stochastic process that this effect appears , if the pdfs of the studied process fulfill certain conditions .    * ad ( q3 ) : * for the ar(1 ) process and the long - range correlated data we observe that the correlation of the data is inversely proportional to the quality of the predictions .",
    "the roc - curves for the wind data , which we assume to be a strongly correlated ar(1 ) process with correlation strength @xmath164 , display also a bad predictability .",
    "this effect is due to the special definition of the events as increments .",
    "the asymptotic expression for the likelihood ratio in eq.([m3 ] ) provides us also with a formally understanding of the @xmath94-dependence .",
    "all the considerations made in this contribution are made for a very simple but general method . in order to make predictions",
    ", we use the largest maximum of the a posterior pdf or the likelihood . for multimodal distributions , one can think about more sophisticated methods , which take into account also other maxima of the distribution .",
    "furthermore , we investigate only stationary processes in these contributions . it remains to be studied , whether the answers , obtained to the questions ( * q1*)-(*q3 * ) are also valid for non - stationary processes or multimodal distributions .",
    "+    e. g. a. was supported by capes ( brazil ) .",
    "the total probability @xmath125 to find increments of size @xmath95 can be obtained by integrating the pre - form of the posterior probability in eq .",
    "[ int1 ] . for the example of the ar(1 ) process the corresponding integral reads @xmath203 in the special case @xmath204 one can find the analytical form of the total probability @xmath205 using again an integral identity from @xcite .",
    "the resulting value @xmath206 corresponds to the intuitive expectation one would have , since for @xmath204 the condition of our extreme event is always fulfilled if @xmath52 is larger than @xmath51 .",

    ", we find the following asymptotic form of the total probability to find increments of size @xmath95    @xmath210",
