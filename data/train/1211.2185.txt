    "the reconstruction relations introduced in the previous section rely on the special form of the interaction hamiltonian eq .",

    "so it is a crucial question to ask where in nature the momentum observable of one subsystem , here @xmath14 of the meter @xmath1 , is coupled to the position observable of another subsystem , here @xmath42 of the unknown system @xmath0 . in the next section we recall a straightforward optical realization for which the derived reconstruction relations hold . for another optical version with a very different aim , see ref .",

    "hence for @xmath45 we obtain a beam splitter with very low reflection , which corresponds to the weak - coupling regime . on the other hand , the value",

    "analogous relations hold for the quadratures @xmath24 and @xmath14 of the meter mode .",
    "hence we see that the beam splitter interaction closely resembles the interaction modeled by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnmhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the additional term , determined by the product @xmath50 , will actually not affect the postselected expectation value eq .",

    "we can now specify the calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec : wm ] using the beam splitter interaction given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : specmdstate ] ) , where @xmath51 is now a position quadrature eigenstate .",
    "thus eq.([eq : specmdstate ] ) is just the @xmath10 representation of the vacuum state @xmath52 .",
    "the first step of the postselection is now a projective measurement of the momentum quadrature observable @xmath32 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qoimp ] .     and meter mode @xmath1 are prepared in their respective states and get coupled by a beam splitter ( bs ) leaving them in the joint state @xmath3 .",
    "afterwards , using homodyne detectors hds and hdm , momentum and position quadratures are measured .",
    "based on the momentum quadrature readings on hds we can postselect the expectation values of the position quadrature at hdm .",

    "( [ eq : psprobapprox ] ) .",
    "now we can continue with the expectation value of the position quadrature @xmath24 , also neglecting all terms of order higher than linear in @xmath44 , which results in @xmath56 = \\theta \\left\\ { \\textrm{re}\\left[x_w^{(p)}\\right ] - \\textrm{im}\\left[p_w^{(p)}\\right]\\right\\ }   .",

    "hence a beam splitter interaction with a small parameter @xmath44 and a specifically chosen postselection measurement can be used to obtain the real part of the position quadrature weak value @xmath60 .",
    "based on this information and the knowledge about the probability @xmath53 of finding an eigenvalue @xmath39 in the postselection measurement , the unknown state @xmath8 of the system mode @xmath0 can be reconstructed using exactly the reconstruction relations derived in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : recrelphase ] ) and ( [ eq : recrelabs ] ) .",
    "note that the reconstruction relations for phase , eq .",

    "( [ eq : bsint ] ) .",
    "a different choice of observables and interaction may thus lead to reconstruction relations suitable for representations in terms of other degrees of freedom .",
    "this suggests that the general idea behind this reconstruction scheme might be applicable to a broader range of physical systems , not only light modes coupled by a beam splitter .",
    "to see if the reconstruction scheme presented in the previous paragraphs is really feasible , we will numerically simulate the setup shown in fig.[fig : qoimp ] and investigate the various influences of relevant parameters .",
    "we will first focus on the errors introduced by neglecting higher orders of the beam splitter parameter @xmath44 .",

    "we choose the state @xmath61 of the system mode @xmath0 , where @xmath62 is a normalization constant and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are coherent states of light @xcite .",
    "note that this state in fact contains nontrivial phase and modulus dependencies which allow us to simulate essential features of the reconstruction .",
    "first we have to decide how small @xmath44 shall be chosen to justify neglecting all terms of order higher than linear in @xmath44 .",

    "next we insert the results of these calculations into the reconstruction relations given in eqs.([eq : recrelphase ] ) and ( [ eq : recrelabs ] ) .",
    "as these relations have been derived disregarding all terms of order higher than linear in @xmath44 , they might be rough approximations , unless @xmath44 is small enough . to quantify the error , we compute the reconstruction error @xmath65 between the reconstructed state @xmath66 and the exact state @xmath8 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : qoe ] we compare wigner functions of the reconstructed states to the wigner function of the exact state and we also show the corresponding reconstruction error , eq.([eq : recerror ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : exstate ] ) , by using the proposed scheme . however , negative parts of the wigner functions are very sensitive to a badly chosen parameter @xmath44 .    remarkably for a 50:50 beam splitter , i.e. , @xmath46 , the setup depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : recresults10e4 ] the statistics here is much better .",
    "the postselected data now show stronger fluctuations only in those regions where the probability @xmath53 is small .",
    "hence the reconstructed phase deviates considerably only when the modulus has already become exponentially small .",

    "we show the pure measurement data , namely , approximated probabilities and approximated expectation values , as well as the resulting reconstructed phase .",
    "the steps in the probabilities and expectation values as well as the edges in the reconstructed phases are an artifact of the finite bin width @xmath71 .",

    "furthermore , we notice that in general those parts of the reconstructed phases located in the vicinity of @xmath79 are in better agreement with the exact phase than outer parts situated at larger values of @xmath39 .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : recrelphase ] ) , we start the integration of the postselected expectation value at @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the reconstructed and exact phases agree perfectly at this point",
    ". then we need more and more expectation values to reconstruct the phase for increasing values of @xmath39 .",
    "hence the statistical errors involved in every single expectation value sum up .",
    "second , the statistical error of a single expectation value increases when the corresponding probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath39 decreases .",
    "this is most clearly visible from the outer parts of the estimated expectation values in figs .",
    "[ fig : recresults10e4 ] and [ fig : recresults10e5 ] , which tend to fluctuate more strongly around the exact value as the probability @xmath53 gets smaller .    due to these intricacies",
    ", the reconstructed phase is more sensitive to statistical errors than the reconstructed modulus . even for @xmath77 measurement runs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : recresults10e5 ] ) the reconstructed phase does not match the exact value as nicely as does the reconstructed modulus .",
    "for @xmath73 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : recresults10e4 ] ) this contrast is even more pronounced . as in other reconstruction schemes @xcite ,",
    "it is harder to reconstruct the phase than the absolute value of the quantum state .",
    "however , in the scheme discussed here this sensitivity of the phase can be fully traced back to the measured data : the set of postselected expectation values needs to be known with good statistical confidence and on the whole @xmath39 axis .",
    "this also means that quantum states @xmath8 with regions in the quadrature distribution @xmath80 that are nonzero and separated by an intermediate region where the quadrature distribution is equal to zero can not be reconstructed easily . in these gaps",
    "we will never find a postselected expectation value and hence we will lose the phase relation between parts of the quadrature representation @xmath81 separated by these gaps . to a certain degree this can be seen already in figs .",
    "[ fig : recresults10e4 ] and [ fig : recresults10e5 ] .",
    "for some values of @xmath39 we are missing the corresponding expectation values ( see , e.g. , @xmath82 in fig.[fig : recresults10e5 ] ) , and hence we lose track of the phase .",
    "however , as this happens here in a region where @xmath29 stays exponentially small , it is not very problematic and the reconstruction error @xmath68 is still small .",
    "an explicit example of a state showing a distinct gap in the probability distribution @xmath80 is the state @xmath83 where @xmath62 again marks the normalization constant for a superposition of two coherent states @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    , expectation value @xmath72 $ ] , and phase @xmath30 as a function of the momentum quadrature @xmath39 for the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cestate ] ) . depicted",
    "are results for @xmath77 measurement runs for a beam splitter parameter @xmath67 and a bin width @xmath74 .",
    "the small probability at the origin causes gaps in the simulated expectation values .",
    "hence we lose track of the phase at the origin and can only guess the relative phase between the two regions left and right of the origin .",
    "therefore direct reconstruction of this state fails .",
    "[ fig : recresultsce ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : recresultsce ] we show the corresponding monte carlo simulated data in comparison to the exact results .",
    "the probability @xmath80 around the origin is so small that there are values of @xmath39 which never appear on our meter hds in all of the @xmath77 simulated measurements .",
    "it is exactly those values of @xmath39 where we can find no estimate for the postselected expectation value .",
    "therefore , the reconstructed expectation value is not continuous around the origin and we can not use eq .",
    "( [ eq : recrelphase ] ) to reconstruct the phase on the complete @xmath39 axis .    however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recresultsce ] , we can integrate the reconstructed expectation values in those regions where @xmath80 is large enough and reconstruct a phase .",
    "to this end we have to choose two different starting points of the integration eq .",
    "( [ eq : recrelphase ] ) , each lying within one of these regions .",
    "this means we explicitly pick a certain `` global '' phase in each of the two regions .",
    "hence we introduce an arbitrary relative phase shift between the two regions .",
    "now let us compare this to the exact result also shown in fig.[fig : recresultsce ] .",
    "the exact value of the phase @xmath30 jumps by @xmath84 at the origin and is otherwise constant .",
    "the two parts of the reconstructed phase show this constant behavior in the corresponding regions where the influence of the statistical error is small , i.e. , where @xmath80 is reasonably large .",
    "the difference between these two constant values is exactly the relative phase shift introduced by simply choosing a `` global '' phase in each region separately .",
    "therefore , without any additional measurements we can not determine this relative phase shift . consequently for this example reconstruction fails .",
    "fortunately , gaps in the probability distribution are visible from the measured data and therefore indicate whether we can rely on the reconstructed state or not .",
    "a possible workaround is the reconstruction of a unitarily transformed state , not showing any gaps .",
    "one example would be to measure suitable rotated quadratures on the homodyne detectors .",
    "this is equivalent to implementing a unitary transformation rotating the wigner function of the input state . but",
    "this procedure will not dispose of gaps in a state with a rotationally invariant wigner function , such as , for example , a fock state .",
    "so there is no general recipe to find a unitary transformation that is easily implementable and removes the gaps .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to use weak measurements to reconstruct a continuous - variable state in quantum optics .",
    "the modulus of a suitably chosen representation can be reconstructed from projective measurements on the system itself , while the corresponding phase has to be extracted from a complete set of postselected expectation values measured on a weakly coupled meter device .",
    "an appealing facet of the presented reconstruction scheme is the simplicity of the reconstruction relations which turn measured data into quantum state information .",
    "moreover , this measurement concept can be realized with basic elements of linear optics and homodyne detection .",
    "however , the sorting required for the postselection of data poses additional problems .",
    "the reconstruction of the phase is not straightforward for states with gaps in the probability distribution which determines the sorting .",
