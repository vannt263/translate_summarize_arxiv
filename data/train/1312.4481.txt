    "[ sec : intro ]    turbulent magnetized plasmas are encountered in a wide variety of astrophysical situations like the solar corona , accretion disks , but also in magnetic fusion devices such as tokamaks . in practice , the study of such plasmas requires solving the maxwell equations coupled to the computation of the plasma response .",
    "different ways are possible to compute this response : the fluid or the kinetic description .",
    "unfortunately the fluid approach seems to be insufficient when one wants to study the behavior of zonal flow , the interaction between waves and particles or the occurrence of turbulence in magnetized plasmas for example .",
    "most of the time these plasmas are weakly collisional , and then they require a kinetic description represented by the vlasov - maxwell system . the numerical simulation of the full vlasov equation involves the discretization of the six - dimensional phase space @xmath0 , which is still a challenging issue .",
    "in the context of strongly magnetized plasmas however , the motion of the particles is particular since it is confined around the magnetic field lines ; the frequency of this cyclotron motion is faster than the frequencies of interest .",
    "therefore , the physical system can be reduced to four or five dimensions by averaging over the gyroradius of charged particles ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "the development of accurate and stable numerical techniques for plasma turbulence ( 4d drift kinetic , 5d gyrokinetic and 6d kinetic models ) is one of our long term objectives .",
    "actually there are already a large variety of numerical methods based on direct numerical simulation techniques .",
    "the vlasov equation is discretized in phase space using either semi - lagrangian @xcite , finite element @xcite , finite difference @xcite or discontinuous galerkin @xcite schemes .",
    "most of these methods are based on a time splitting discretization which is particularly efficient for classical systems as vlasov - poisson or vlasov - maxwell systems . in that case , the characteristic curves corresponding to the split operator are straight lines and are solved exactly . therefore , the numerical error is only due to the splitting in time and the phase space discretization of the distribution function .",
    "furthermore for such time splitting schemes , the semi - lagrangian methods on cartesian grids coupled with lagrange , hermite or cubic spline interpolation techniques are conservative @xcite . hence , these methods are now currently used and have proved their efficiency for various applications . in this context semi - lagrangian methods are often observed to be less dissipative than classical finite volume or finite difference schemes . however , for more elaborated kinetic equations like the 4d drift kinetic @xcite or 5d gyrokinetic @xcite equations , or even the two dimensional guiding center model @xcite , time splitting techniques can not necessarily be applied . thus characteristic curves are more sophisticated and required a specific time discretization .",
    "for instance , in @xcite several numerical solvers have been developed using an eulerian formulation for gyro - kinetic models .",
    "however , spurious oscillations often appear in the non - linear phase when small structures occur and it is difficult to distinguish physical and numerical oscillations . moreover , for these models semi - lagrangian methods are no more conservative",
    ", hence the long time behavior of the numerical solution may become unsuitable .    for this purpose ,",
    "we want to develop a class of numerical methods based on the hermite interpolation which is known to be less dissipative than lagrange interpolation @xcite together with a weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) reconstruction applied to semi - lagrangian and finite difference methods .",
    "actually , hermite interpolation with weno schemes were already studied in @xcite in the context of discontinuous galerkin methods with slope limiters .",
    "a system of equations for the unknown function and its first derivative is evolved in time and used in the reconstruction . moreover , a similar technique , called cip ( cubic interpolation propagation ) , has also been proposed for transport equations in plasma physics applications @xcite , but the computational cost is strongly increased since the unknown and all the derivatives are advected in phase space . in  @xcite , a semi - lagrangian method with hermite interpolation has been proposed and shown to be efficient and less dissipative than lagrangian interpolation . in this latter case , the first derivatives are approximated by a fourth order centered finite difference formula .    here",
    ", we also apply a similar pseudo - hermite reconstruction @xcite and meanwhile introduce an appropriate weno reconstruction to control spurious oscillation leading to nonlinear schemes .",
    "we develop third and fifth order methods and apply them to semi - lagrangian ( non - conservative schemes ) and conservative finite difference methods .",
    "our numerical results will be compared to the usual semi - lagrangian method with cubic spline reconstruction @xcite and the classical fifth order weno finite difference scheme  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first present the vlasov equation and related models which will be investigated numerically . then in section [ sec : hsl ] , the semi - lagrangian method is proposed with high order hermite interpolation with a weno reconstruction to control spurious oscillations . in section [ sec : hfd ] , conservative finite difference schemes with hermite weno reconstructions are detailed . the section [ sec : test ] the one - dimensional free transport equation with oscillatory initial data is investigated to compare our schemes with classical ones ( semi - lagrangian with cubic spline interpolation and conservative finite difference schemes with weno reconstruction ) .",
    "then we perform numerical simulations on the simplified paraxial vlasov - poisson model and on the guiding center model for highly magnetized plasma in two dimension .",
    "the evolution of the density of particles @xmath1 in the phase space @xmath2 , @xmath3 is given by the vlasov equation , @xmath4 where the force field @xmath5 is coupled with the distribution function @xmath6 giving a nonlinear system .",
    "we mention the well known vlasov - poisson ( vp ) and vlasov - maxwell ( vm ) models describing the evolution of particles under the effects of self - consistent electro - magnetic fields .",
    "we define the charge density @xmath7 and current density @xmath8 by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the single charge .",
    "the force field is given for the vlasov - poisson model by @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the mass of one particle .",
    "for the vlasov - maxwell system , we have @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are solution of the maxwell equations @xmath16 with the compatibility condition @xmath17 which is verified by the vlasov equation solution .    in the sequel we will also consider the so - called guiding center model  @xcite , which has been derived to describe the evolution of the charge density in a highly magnetized plasma in the transverse plane of a tokamak .",
    "this model is described as follows @xmath18   -\\delta\\phi=\\rho , \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : gc}\\ ] ] where the velocity @xmath19 is divergence free .",
    "transport equations   or ( [ eq : gc ] ) can be recast into an advective form @xmath20 where @xmath21 . hence",
    ", classical backward semi - lagrangian method can be applied to solve  .",
    "furthermore , under the assumption @xmath22 , equations or can also be rewritten in a conservative form @xmath23 for which a finite difference method can be used .",
    "we introduce a high order hermite interpolation coupled with a weight essentially non - oscillatory ( hweno ) reconstruction for semi - lagrangian methods .",
    "actually , the semi - lagrangian method becomes a classical method for the numerical solution of the vlasov equation because of its high accuracy and its small dissipation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it does not constraint any restriction on the time step size . indeed , the key issue of the semi - lagrangian method compared to classical eulerian schemes is that it uses the characteristic curves corresponding to the transport equation to update the unknown from one time step to the next one .",
    "let us recall the main feature of the backward semi - lagrangian method .",
    "for a given @xmath24 , the differential system @xmath25   \\mathbf{x}(s)= { \\mathbf{x } } ,   \\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ] is associated to the transport equation  .",
    "we denote its solution by @xmath26 .",
    "the backward semi - lagrangian method is decomposed into two steps for computing the function @xmath27 at time @xmath28 from the function @xmath29 at time @xmath30 :    1 .",
    "for each mesh point @xmath31 of phase space , compute @xmath32 , the value of the characteristic at time @xmath33 who is equal to @xmath31 at time @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   as the function @xmath6 of transport equation",
    "verifies @xmath34 we obtain the value of @xmath35 by computing @xmath36 by interpolation , since @xmath32 is not usually a mesh point .    in practice ,",
    "a cubic spline interpolation is often used  @xcite .",
    "it gives very good results , but it has the drawback of being non local which causes a higher communication overhead on parallel computers . moreover spurious oscillations may occur around discontinuities . on the other hand ,",
    "the cubic hermite interpolation is local , and has been shown in  @xcite to be less dissipative than lagrange interpolation polynomial .",
    "however , it has still spurious oscillations for discontinuous solution .    here ,",
    "we develop a third and fifth order hermite interpolation coupled with a weighted essentially non - oscillatory procedure , such that it is accurate for smooth solutions and it removes spurious oscillations around discontinuities or high frequencies which can not be solved on a fixed mesh .      consider a uniform mesh @xmath37 of the computational domain and assume that the values of the distribution function @xmath38 and its derivative @xmath39 are known at the grid points .",
    "the standard cubic hermite polynomial @xmath40 on the interval @xmath41 $ ] can be expressed as follows : @xmath42   & & \\displaystyle + \\frac{\\delta x(f'_i+f'_{i+1})-2(f_{i+1}-f_i)}{\\delta x^3}(x - x_i)^2(x - x_{i+1 } ) ,   \\end{array } \\label{eq : poly_hermite}\\ ] ]    the polynomial @xmath40 verifies : @xmath43 h_3(x_{i+1})=f_{i+1},&h'_3(x_{i+1})=f'_{i+1}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    moreover , we define two quadratic polynomials on @xmath44 by @xmath45 \\displaystyle   h_r(x)\\,=\\,f_i+\\frac{f_{i+1}-f_i}{\\delta x}(x - x_i)+\\frac{\\delta x {",

    "thus , let us write @xmath50 as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are weno weights depending on @xmath54 .",
    "when the function @xmath6 is smooth , we expect that @xmath55 so that we recover the cubic hermite polynomial .",
    "otherwise , we expect that @xmath56 according to the region where @xmath6 is less smooth .",
    "to determine these weno weights , we follow the strategy given in  @xcite and first define smoothness indicators by integration of the first and second derivatives of @xmath57 and @xmath58 on the interval @xmath44 : @xmath59 then we set @xmath52 and @xmath53 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 where @xmath62 to avoid the denominator to be zero .",

    "finally , let us observe that this technique can be easily extended to high space dimension on cartesian grids .",
    "when the velocity @xmath90 is not constant ( [ eq : transport_vlasov ] ) , the semi - lagrangian method is not conservative even when @xmath91 , hence mass is no longer conserved and the long time behavior of the numerical solution can be wrong even for small time steps .",
    "therefore , high order conservative methods may be more appropriate even if they are restricted by a cfl condition .",
    "an alternative is to use the finite difference formulation in the conservative form and to use the semi - lagrangian method for the flux computation @xcite .    in this section ,",
