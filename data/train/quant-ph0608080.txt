    "in addition , they form a universal resource for quantum computation  @xcite and enable computation in scenarios where the employed two - qubit gate is probabilistic  @xcite . however",
    ", any practical implementation will introduce noise to the system .",
    "the noise - induced errors need to be minimized , and corrected , before a practical application of these states is considered . one way to achieve this is by purification , where many copies of the noisy state are combined to yield a single perfect copy .",
    "the concentration of entanglement in two - qubit systems has yielded some important results in quantum information , such as secure communication via privacy amplification  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the detailed study of similar transformations in many - qubit systems has only recently commenced .",
    "the purification of two - qubit states was first examined in  @xcite , and the performance of these protocols is optimal if the operations are perfect .",
    "the efficacy of the proposed protocols in the presence of noise was explored in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the question of purifying multipartite states has arisen @xcite .",
    "a variety of protocols have been discussed , starting from a subset of graph states @xcite and generalizing to arbitrary graph @xcite and stabilizer states  @xcite .",
    "these different protocols tend to trade between a large tolerance of noise  @xcite and the scaling of purification rate  @xcite",
    ". to date , little has been said on the subject of what is optimal , although some ( non - tight ) bounds have previously been found , such as in the case of independent local @xmath0-noise  @xcite , or for ghz states  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we prove the optimality of certain purification protocols for a variety of noise models by considering general upper bounds .",
    "these derivations are based on a central theorem that analyzes the purification of multipartite states in terms of the purification of bipartite states , and hence allows for a direct extension of previous optimality proofs . when restricted to @xmath0-noise ,",
    "the application of the theorem becomes straightforward for a certain class of graph states called locally reconstructible states .",
    "these states allow for the direct application of the optimal bipartite purification protocol for each link of the graph , thus extending it to the multipartite case .",
    "subsequently , a wide range of upper bounds in the tolerated error rates are derived for a variety of error models and states , while optimality is numerically demonstrated in certain cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after an initial introduction to graph states ( sec .",
    "[ sec : graphs ] ) and purification protocols ( sec .",
    "[ sec : purification ] ) , we introduce our main theorem in sec .",
    "[ sec_optimal ] , which proves that if purification of a bipartite state is impossible , so is the purification of related multipartite states .",
    "this result is applied to a variety of error models in sec .",
    "[ sec : upperbound ] , including local @xmath0-noise and depolarizing noise .",
    "for the case of @xmath0-noise we prove optimality of the two purification protocols under consideration for a sub - class of graph states . in the case of maximally depolarizing noise , we prove a universal bound which applies to all graph states . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : vbs ] , we derive an example of a valence bond state that can be optimally purified , proving that our method is not merely limited to graph states . critically , the example that we produce has a finite entanglement length .",
    "the presented results expand and extend the work of  @xcite .",
    "for the majority of this paper , we will be interested in the purification of graph states .",
    "these can be defined in two equivalent ways . with a particular graph @xmath1 , we can associate a set of vertices , @xmath2 , and edges , @xmath3 , which connect pairs of vertices .",
    "the first way to define a pure graph state is as the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath4 where we have attached a qubit to each vertex and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the familiar pauli matrices applied to qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the individual terms @xmath9 commute with each other , @xmath10=0 $ ] , and thus stabilize the graph state .",
    "these are scaled by arbitrary coupling strengths @xmath11 , which we will subsequently take to be equal .",
    "we note that @xmath12=0 $ ] if @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which means that the excited states of the hamiltonian are described by local @xmath0-rotations , and that these local rotations constitute a complete , orthogonal basis over the hilbert space associated with the graph . an equivalent way to define a graph state is in a more operational sense , where we prepare each qubit in the state @xmath15 , and apply controlled - phase gates along each edge of the graph .    for what follows ,",
    "the action of measurements on a graph state are of particular interest @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-measurement removes a vertex from the graph , along with its edges . if we wish to form a graph state from two - qubit states corresponding to the edges of the graph , it is simplest to revert to the matrix product state formalism @xcite , where we apply measurements on all of the qubits that need to be combined to a single qubit . in the case of a linear cluster state ,",
    "this simply corresponds to performing a controlled - phase gate between the two pairs , measuring one qubit in the @xmath16-basis , and performing a hadamard rotation on the other .",
    "although this simple method does not generalize to other graphs , the examples which we choose to give will be for linear cluster states , and hence this description is valid . for other graph states ,",
    "the operation that we apply must project @xmath17 qubits on a local site to 1 qubit , and is represented as @xmath18 for example , the required operations to create the pentagon of fig .",

    ", we examine some of its properties in app .",
    "[ app : a ] .",
    "importantly , this class includes all cluster states ( @xmath19-dimensional cubes ) , ghz states ( one vertex with edges to all others ) , and graphs which are locally equivalent to the codewords of error - correcting codes such as the shor-[[9,1,3 ] ] code , the 5-qubit code ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twocol](a ) ) and the steane-[[7,1,3 ] ] code ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twocol](c ) ) .",
    "indeed , in both of these figures , we provide a partition that demonstrates the lr character of the corresponding graph .",
    "we are not aware of this classification of graph states coinciding with any previous definition .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : twocol ] we provide two examples that show firstly that lr states are not necessarily two - colorable  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twocol](a ) ) and , secondly , that not all two - colorable states are lr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twocol](d ) ) . in this case , for every possible partition , there is always a qubit that has at least two edges crossing the partition .",
    "one such partition is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : twocol](d ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can show that for all graphs of up to seven qubits the corresponding graph states are locally equivalent to lr states .",
    "indeed , all the graphs in @xcite , which are used to categorize the local unitarily equivalent graphs of up to seven qubits , are lr .",
    "that is , one can reversibly transform pure graph states of seven or fewer qubits to lr states using local operations @xmath20 . for larger systems , there exist examples that are not locally equivalent to an lr graph . specifically , the icosahedral graph ( 12 vertices , degree 5 , fig .",
    "[ fig : icos ] ) and its local equivalences form a collection of 54 graphs , none of which are lr . since the operations @xmath20 are clifford operators , it remains a possibility that there are other local unitaries that could be applied which yield a different set of local equivalences @xcite .",
    "the aim of a purification protocol is to take many identical copies of a noisy state @xmath21 and produce a single , pure , copy @xmath22 .",
    "we consider that each qubit in the state @xmath21 is held by a different party ( alice , bob  ) , and that they hold the same qubit from every copy .",
    "the parties are restricted to applying stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) , which we initially assume to be perfect .",
    "these restrictions serve to illustrate the entanglement properties of @xmath21 .",
    "there are also physically motivated systems where locality restrictions come into play , such as with quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 is diagonal in the graph state basis , i.e. @xmath23 where @xmath8 indicates which of the @xmath17 qubits a @xmath0-rotation is applied to . as has previously been explained elsewhere ( see , for example , @xcite ) , any non - diagonal state can be made diagonal by slocc without changing the diagonal elements by probabilistically applying the stabilizers ( with probabilities suitably chosen to negate the off - diagonal elements ) . the numbers @xmath24 encapsulate all the information about the errors . we are assuming that we know all of these values i.e.  we know the noise model , although it is not _",
    "strictly _ necessary to know the error probability , @xmath25 .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath26 is the largest element , since we wish to purify towards @xmath22 .",
    "this is the fidelity of the initial state @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath26 were not the largest value , one could apply @xmath0-rotations to make it the largest value , as these permute the diagonal elements .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in proving universally applicable bounds .",
    "we shall define the _ threshold fidelity _ @xmath27 as the value of @xmath26 below which purification is impossible , regardless of the protocol employed , for a specific noise model .",
    "all protocols have their own critical fidelity @xmath28 below which that protocol does not work .",
    "optimality of a protocol is proven when equality holds .      in the following subsection",
    ", we will propose a protocol that is based on bipartite purification and thus is easily analyzed . indeed , for some types of noise and classes of states , one can prove its optimality .",
    "however , this protocol will not perform well in general , and so when we are interested in other noise models , we are forced to resort to a multipartite purification protocol , such as the one described in  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this specific protocol as the genuine multipartite purification protocol ( gmpp ) .",
    "the gmpp is applied to two - colorable graph states , which are graph states where every qubit can be labelled as either a or b such that all edges connect an a and a b. the protocol proceeds by application of arbitrarily ordered sequences of two sub - protocols @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath0-rotations form a complete basis for the graph state , the state can be labelled by vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 , specifying which a or b qubits , respectively , have @xmath0-rotations applied to them .",
    "the action of the two protocols is @xmath33 which then have to be renormalized .",
    "both are realized by post - selecting on particular measurement results , which means that the rate of purification decreases exponentially with the number of qubits present .",
    "the application of the gmpp is challenging to analyze due to the arbitrary choice of the sub - protocols @xmath29 and @xmath30 at each step .",
    "in general , we resort to numerical exploration which , with finite computational resources , can never tell us precisely how close the gmpp comes to any upper - bound .",
    "another multipartite purification protocol has recently been proposed @xcite , which is easier to analyze for a range of errors , and achieves a superior purification rate .",
    "however , the critical fidelities at which it works are larger than for the gmpp , so little benefit can be derived from comparing them to the threshold fidelities which we calculate .",

    "( d ) all qubits except one from each party are measured in the @xmath16-basis , leaving the remaining qubits in the purified state.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    [ fig : protocol ]    the second purification protocol which we will analyze is certainly not new ( see , for example , @xcite ) , but its simplicity enables the derivation of rigorous results . to implement the protocol ( fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] ) , we initially measure the qubits of the graph state in the @xmath0-basis until we are left with a single two - qubit state @xmath34 .",
    "many copies of this state are then used to purify , if possible , a bell pair @xmath35 . by performing @xmath0-measurements on different sets of qubits , different bell pairs",
    "are generated .",
    "once we have a bell pair for every edge in the graph , we can locally reconstruct the state , e.g.  by applying controlled - phase gates and @xmath16-measurements .",
    "the conditions under which @xmath36 can be purified to @xmath35 are well - known @xcite , @xmath37 and have been shown to be optimal using the positive partial transpose condition @xcite .",
    "hence , we only have to relate @xmath38 to the values of @xmath39 of the original state , @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to this protocol as the divide and rebuild purification protocol ( drpp ) .    in @xcite , we considered the rate of purification for the drpp , which is applicable whenever it is the optimal protocol .",
    "the rate of purification , @xmath40 , for the state @xmath41 was described in terms of the rate of purification of a bell state , @xmath42 , taking the standard definition of rate , @xmath43 this allowed us to bound the rate of purification by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a small geometric factor determined by the graph .",
    "this rate is a vast improvement over the gmpp , although other protocols have better rates at the cost of being less robust @xcite . for @xmath19-dimensional cluster states",
    ", it was shown that the geometrical factor @xmath46 is independent of the size of the graph .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to general graph states , and yields an upper bound @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the maximum degree of @xmath1 i.e.  no vertex has more than @xmath48 edges .",
    "this does not coincide with the result for cluster states because we used knowledge of the geometry of cluster states to optimize our use of resources .",
    "the intention of this paper is to make statements about when purification is impossible for all protocols . to provide such a proof , we consider two parties alice and bob , each locally handling many qubits . the operations they perform are more general , but include , multipartite operations .

    "consider the scenario where we wish to purify a two - qubit state @xmath34 .",
    "provided that many copies of @xmath34 can be converted by slocc into a noisy graph state @xmath21 held by the two parties , then if purification of @xmath34 is impossible , so is purification of @xmath21 .",
    "the veracity of this theorem is shown by contradiction .",
    "we assume that purification of @xmath21 is possible by some protocol . from the condition of the theorem",

    ", there exists a protocol that can purify this state , leading to the pure state @xmath22 .",
    "this can be converted into a maximally entangled two - qubit state by projecting out the additional qubits with local @xmath0-measurements .",
    "hence , @xmath34 can always be purified if @xmath21 can be purified .",
    "if we know that @xmath34 can not be purified , we have a contradiction , and the initial assumption must be false .",
    "these steps are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : optimality ] .",
    "a corollary is that if the state @xmath21 is described by a parameter @xmath25 indicating the probability of an error occurring , this theorem gives an upper - bound on the value of @xmath25 such that @xmath21 can be purified .",
    "this could alternatively be viewed as a lower - bound on the required fidelity of the state @xmath21 .",
    "we choose to refer to it as an upper - bound .",
    "little is known about the conversion between bipartite ( multi - level ) mixed states @xmath49 @xcite , as required for the local reconstruction condition of theorem [ main_theorem ] .",
    "thus , we have to examine different noise models on a case - by - case basis , which we do in sec .",
    "[ sec : upperbound ] . for lr graphs , such as fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs](a ) , local reconstruction simply involves replacing each link across the alice / bob partition by a single copy of the two - qubit state .",
    "however , for non - lr graphs , such as fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs](c ) , this is not possible because two links need to be replaced which connect to a single qubit .",
    "while reconstruction is still possible in these cases , it generally means an increase in the local error probability , which becomes correlated in a different way to the errors in the rest of the graph .",
    "this makes analysis more difficult , weakening the bounds that one can derive .",
    "theorem [ main_theorem ] can be generalized by making two further observations .",
    "firstly , it is not necessary to restrict to a bipartite state @xmath34 , since any state which can be locally converted into the state @xmath21 could be used .",
    "however , the only existing optimality conditions apply to two - qubit states .",
    "secondly , the states that we use need not be graph states , it is just that the formalism of graph states guarantees that we can convert @xmath22 into @xmath35 . in the general case",
    ", we should be able to perform measurements on @xmath22 which return a pure 2-qubit state with non - zero entanglement , and can subsequently be distilled to a maximally - entangled state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vbs ] , we apply this method to the concrete example of a valence bond state .    , and applying controlled - phase gates between them .",
    "( c ) the triangular graph is the simplest configuration for which the optimality proof fails.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      essential to the application of theorem [ main_theorem ] is the knowledge of when a two - qubit state can be purified , which can only happen if there is non - zero distillable entanglement between the two parties",
    ". we can therefore interpret theorem [ main_theorem ] as stating that purification of a multipartite state is impossible if there is a bipartite split for which there is no distillable entanglement . following this interpretation , we can describe existing multipartite purification protocols as examples of bipartite purification protocols which use separable operations . in particular , we observe that the operation of the gmpp is closely related to the protocol of @xcite .",
    "the action of this high - dimensional bipartite purification protocol can be analyzed @xcite , enabling rigorous comparison between its performance and the upper - bounds calculated in this paper .    with the aforementioned entanglement interpretation ,",
    "it is simple to see that theorem [ main_theorem ] is a constructive statement that can sometimes be applied to discover if a state can be written in the form @xmath50 consequently , we should expect similar results to those of @xcite , where the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) condition is applied to bipartite groupings of multipartite states .",
    "however , in @xcite , extra depolarization steps are applied which tend to remove entanglement from the system and , consequently , tight bounds are not expected .    in general ,",
    "how should our technique compare to the ppt condition , if one does not introduce additional depolarizing steps ? as expressed in terms of a reconstruction from two - qubit states , our upper bounds are strictly weaker than ppt .",
    "we can see that this is the case because starting from any two - qubit state which is separable ( for which the ppt condition is necessary and sufficient ) , and applying slocc results in a state which necessarily has ppt i.e.  is separable , and purification is impossible .",
    "however , there also exist states with ppt which can not be generated from two - qubit separable states , which are known as bound - entangled states .",
    "therefore our condition is strictly weaker than ppt .",
    "nevertheless , our condition has two major benefits .",
    "firstly , as already indicated , we need not be restricted to reconstructing from two - qubit states . in particular , _ if _ there exist bound entangled states with non - ppt ( this still remains an open question ) , then using these as a basis for reconstruction yields a stronger bound on purification than the ppt condition can provide .",
    "secondly , our technique is constructive , which eases its application in many scenarios , including the situation where the gates applied during the purification procedure are faulty ( this will be explored in a later paper ) .",
    "given theorem [ main_theorem ] , it is interesting to apply the method to different types of noise , yielding bounds on when noisy states are not purifiable .",
    "it may not be possible to attain these bounds with purification protocols , and we will be able to demonstrate that the drpp does not always achieve them .",
    "numerical studies of the gmpp indicate a much tighter match in performance , although given the asymptotic approach to the bound , and the existence of strong local attractors , in most cases it is impossible to precisely verify whether they match .",
    "a straightforward application of our theorem comes when considering local @xmath0-noise . while a very restrictive noise model , it has two physical motivations , namely that the thermal state of the hamiltonian in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : define_graph ] ) is equivalent to the ground state with local @xmath0-noise , and that @xmath0-noise is a significant source of error in some experimental implementations , such as optical lattices . moreover , as we will see , within our treatment this type of noise is the worst - case noise , giving the lowest probability threshold of all the local noise models considered here .",
    "we assume that a @xmath0-error occurs on each qubit independently , with probability @xmath25 .",
    "when we restrict to lr states , local reconstruction follows by replacing any links across the bipartition with noisy two - qubit states .",
    "the structure of the class guarantees that the only subsequent operations that we need to perform are local controlled - phase gates between qubits .",
    "since these gates commute with @xmath0-errors , then starting with a two - qubit state , a many - qubit state can be built with the same error probability .",
    "the two - qubit state can not be purified if @xmath51 so this must hold for all lr states .    similarly , since @xmath0-measurements commute with the @xmath0-errors",
    ", we can show that the drpp can purify the whole state provided @xmath52 thus , the protocol is optimal , with a threshold probability of @xmath53 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath54 this provides a useful benchmark to test other purification protocols , such as the gmpp ( see sec .  [ sec : compare ] ) .",
    "note that the drpp can purify all graph states with the same critical fidelity .",
    "local @xmath0-noise also corresponds to the thermal state of the hamiltonian in eqn .",

    "we now give a reversible procedure which is local to this partitioning to convert the state into a ghz state which is lr across the partition . by applying controlled - phase gates along all edges that are not connected to our chosen qubit ( remember that these gates commute with the @xmath0-noise ) ,",

    "the results derived for a triangular graph for both local @xmath16-noise and local @xmath62-noise hold for all fully connected graphs , @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the binary weight of the number @xmath7 . in the case of @xmath62-noise , a single @xmath62-error is the same as correlated @xmath0-errors across all qubits , so all @xmath62-errors are the same , and the noisy state only has two diagonal elements , the first of which is the probability that an even number of errors occurred , @xmath235 upon performing a @xmath0-measurement on one of the qubits , we are left with the state @xmath236 and the diagonal elements must be the same as they were before . this can be verified by writing @xmath237 note that @xmath238 if @xmath8 is an @xmath17-bit binary string , which means that if we get the @xmath239 result , the corrective unitary is a @xmath0-rotation on every qubit .",
    "this reduction to fully connected graphs continues to the case of @xmath240 , which we know can always be purified if it only has two diagonal elements since one element is always greater than @xmath232 .    in the case of @xmath16-noise",
    ", we must verify that an @xmath16-measurement on a single qubit reduces @xmath241 to @xmath236 .",
    "after applying @xmath242 to the state in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : gn ] ) , we are left with a sum over binary strings of even weight . to convert this into @xmath236 , we apply a hadamard on one qubit , and @xmath0-rotations on all the other qubits . since the independent @xmath16 errors commute with this measurement process , this will eventually reduce to the triangle , which we have already solved , and hence @xmath230 is the criterion for purification .",
    "note , however , that when reducing to a two - qubit state , our density matrix has 3 diagonal elements , not 2 as in the case of @xmath62 errors , so purification at @xmath77 is not possible with this protocol .",
    "in @xcite , a bipartite purification protocol was proposed for which subsequent analysis @xcite showed that its behavior is very similar to that of the gmpp , with the added advantage that we can calculate its performance .",
    "as an example , let us consider maximally depolarizing noise applied to a linear state of @xmath17 qubits . for simplicity , and consistency with @xcite",
    ", we shall define @xmath137 , assuming that there are @xmath243 qubits either side of the bipartite split .",
    "the diagonal elements of the initial density matrix , @xmath244 indicate the errors @xmath245 and @xmath8 either side of the partition .",
    "after @xmath175 iterations of the protocol , the unnormalized outcome is @xmath246^{(2^n)}.\\ ] ] for maximally depolarizing noise , @xmath247 following this through and renormalizing , we find that @xmath248}.\\ ] ] for @xmath249 , @xmath250 is independent of @xmath175 , and hence we have found a fixed point of the protocol .",
    "the implication is that there is a critical fidelity of @xmath96 , below which the maximum achievable fidelity is @xmath96 , and above which complete purification is possible ."
