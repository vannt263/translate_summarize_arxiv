    ", some regimes of far - from - equilibrium growth have also been shown to result in robust outcomes@xcite , which indicates novel ( non - equilibrium ) routes towards building robust molecular assemblies .    while non - equilibrium outcomes in relatively detailed and complex processes have been studied ",
    "e.g. , in the process of virus capsid assembly@xcite and dna hybridization@xcite  computational limitations prevent more systematic studies of such systems .",
    "alternatively , simpler ordered frameworks formed from two types of components have been useful in systematically distinguishing the outcomes of equilibrium and non - equilibrium regimes for nucleation and growth@xcite .",

    "near - equilibrium growth is attained when the rate of growth is so slow that binding is nearly reversible .",
    "the first utility of two - component growth is that the outcomes of equilibrium growth are relatively easy to predict .",
    "for example , if the heterogeneous energy of interaction is dominantly the lowest in energy , analogous to the components sodium ( na@xmath0 ) and chloride ( cl@xmath1 ) in a crystal , the equilibrium outcome is `` binary '' ( otherwise the outcomes dominantly display one or the other subunit ) . here",
    ", binary indicates that each neighbor is surrounded by neighbors of opposite color . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice",
    ", such a binary structure resembles a checkerboard structure ( fig .  [ fig : checkervpoly]a ) .",
    "a convenient metric to characterize binary assemblies is the fraction of blues in the assembly ( @xmath2 ) , which , in the case of a binary solid is 0.5 ( like in na@xmath0cl@xmath1 ) .",
    "when growing an assembly at far - from - equilibrium rates ( i.e. , at much greater growth rates ) , the expected equilibrium outcomes ( such as structures displaying @xmath3 for the system above ) are not the outcomes that one encounters@xcite .",
    "this is because , at particular growth rates and subunit - subunit energetics , kinetic traps involving multiple components within the bulk of the assembly are not permitted to rearrange into equilibrium features before those defects get buried@xcite .",
    "mostly , non - equilibrium outcomes are highly sensitive to solution conditions such as the combined and relative concentration of the two components in solution . however , in some cases , the non - equilibrium outcomes are actually robust to some growth conditions@xcite",
    ". presently , while such robust yet non - equilibrium assemblies may present us with new ways to produce novel and controllable materials , an overarching framework for making predictions for such processes is lacking , especially because most existing frameworks for predicting molecular outcomes are based on equilibrium statistical mechanics ( see discussions in refs .   and  ) .    ) , near - equilibrium growth results in a `` checkerboard '' patterned structure with equal ratio of blues and reds ( @xmath3 ) , shown in ( a ) for a 2d square lattice ( henceforth , the ` red ' components are shown faded for increased contrast compared to blue components ) .",
    "interestingly , at a particular interaction energy regime ( @xmath4 ) , while the equilibrium structure remains the checkerboard ( a ) , a new class of non - equilibrium structures  compositional polycrystalline assemblies ( b ) with a particular @xmath2 ( @xmath5 )  form from a range of non - equilibrium growth regimes and red : blue ratios in solution@xcite ( also shown in fig .",

    "the model assumes the following hierarchy of subunit - subunit interaction energies@xcite : the red - blue interaction energy ( @xmath6 ) is the most favorable , the red - red interaction energy ( @xmath7 ) is negligible and intermediate in strength , and the blue - blue interaction energy ( @xmath8 ) is high enough to never permit its occurrence during growth / assembly ( all interaction energies in this manuscript are taken to be the equivalent of binding free energies in actual molecules ) .",

    "this skew in the center of the radial isd versus the center of the coordinate system ( @xmath99 ) is also observed in simulations@xcite , and indicates that , given a set of interaction energies , one may be able to predict not only the assembly s expected plateau / inherent structure , but also the solution conditions ( range of @xmath100 ) within which an out - of - equilibrium assembly s magic ratio will remain the same .",
