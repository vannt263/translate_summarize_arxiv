    "<S> we investigate the effect of the so - called anomalous baryon / meson enhancement to the nuclear modification factor of non - photonic electrons in au+au collisions at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that an enhancement of the charm baryon / meson ratio , as it is observed for non - strange and strange hadrons , can be responsible for part of the amplitude of the nuclear modification factor of non - photonic electrons . about half of the measured suppression of non - photonic electrons in the @xmath1 @xmath2 range can be explained by a charm baryon / meson enhancement of 5 . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution to the non - photonic electron nuclear modification factor has nothing to do with heavy quark energy loss .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most robust experimental evidence for the creation of a new state of matter in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the large suppression of light hadrons at high transverse momentum ( @xmath2 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is well reproduced by models which take into account the radiative energy loss of high @xmath2 light quarks and gluons propagating through a dense medium of colored quarks and gluons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further insights into the underlying mechanism can be obtained from the study of heavy hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , heavy hadrons originate from the fragmentation of ( heavy ) quarks in contrast to light hadrons which are predominantly produced by gluons . </S>",
    "<S> quarks are supposed to lose less energy than gluons in the medium due to a smaller color charge coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , radiative energy loss was predicted to be substantially smaller for heavy quarks as compared to light quarks because of the so called  dead - cone \" effect which limits the medium induced radiative energy loss at forward angles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , recent data from the phenix and the star collaborations in au+au collisions at @xmath0 show that the quenching of non - photonic electrons lies beyond theoretical expectations  @xcite and is as large as that of light mesons . </S>",
    "<S> this is difficult to understand under the common assumption that non - photonic electrons originate predominantly from the decay of @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , the latter originating themselves from heavy ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) quarks hadronization . </S>",
    "<S> reconciling these data with model predictions is a real challenge which triggers a lot of theoretical activities nowadays . only models which assume a very large medium opacity  @xcite or an additional collisional energy loss  @xcite or a very early fragmentation of heavy quarks in the medium  @xcite can describe successfully the data ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that , in contrast to light hadrons , the heavy flavor quenching is , so far , not measured experimentally through identified particles , but in an inclusive way via the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath7 ) of non - photonic electrons distributions of non - photonic electrons in @xmath8 collisions ( @xmath9 ) and in @xmath10 collisions ( @xmath11 ) as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions corresponding to a given centrality class . ] .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we point out the possibility that part of the explanation for the strong suppression of non - photonic electrons might be due to a another source of electrons namely charmed baryons . indeed , whereas light mesons are largely suppressed in heavy ion collisions at rhic , the suppression of non - strange and strange baryons is observed to be much less in the intermediate @xmath2 range ( @xmath14 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is commonly referred to as the anomalous baryon / meson enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> it could challenge our understanding of jet quenching at a first glance but brings however another piece of evidence for the formation of a deconfined medium . </S>",
    "<S> this anomalous baryon / meson enhancement is well understood in the framework of the recombination model which assumes that , at moderate @xmath2 , hadronization occurs via the coalescence of  free \" quarks ( and anti - quarks )  @xcite . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we show that an anomalous baryon / meson enhancement for charm hadrons leads naturally to a non - photonic electron @xmath7 smaller than one . </S>",
    "<S> this is essentially due to a smaller semi - leptonic decay branching ratio and to a softer decay lepton spectrum of charm baryons as compared to charm mesons . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , a fraction of the deviation from the experimentally measured @xmath7 of non - photonic electrons should not be attributed to energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> after the description of the physical process invoked here , we present simple pythia - based simulations to illustrate the magnitude of the effect in au+au collisions at @xmath0 and we compare our results to the phenix data .    </S>",
    "<S> the main assumption we put forward is that , in a deconfined medium , charm baryon production is enhanced relative to charm meson production , as compared to the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is qualitatively justified in the framework of the recombination model . </S>",
    "<S> although this model does not provide predictions on charm hadron production yet , it successfully describes the baryon / meson enhancement measured in au+au collisions at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a relatively good agreement is obtained not only for the light hadron ratio @xmath15 , but also for heavier hadron ratios such as @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite . however , extrapolating these results to charm hadrons is not straightforward because the mass of the charm quark is much larger than that of light and strange quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences are threefold as far as the recombination mechanism is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> first , whereas the @xmath2 of a light baryon ( meson ) amounts to 3 ( 2 ) times the initial @xmath2 of its valence quarks , the @xmath2 of a ( single ) charm baryon or a charm meson is likely to be very close to that of the charm quark . secondly , considering a light quark and a heavy quark with the same velocity ( which is the essential requirement for the coalescence process to take place  @xcite ) , the heavy quark momentum is much larger than that of light partons . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , one can expect the enhancement of charm baryon / meson to appear at higher @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the recombination model indeed predicts , for non - strange and strange hadrons , that the heavier the hadron , the larger the @xmath2 of the baryon / meson enhancement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the fragmentation time of heavy quarks is small as compared to light quarks . </S>",
    "<S> according to  @xcite , the formation time of a @xmath18 pion , @xmath3 meson and @xmath4 meson is @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively and it is as small as @xmath22 for a @xmath23 with @xmath24 . due to these considerations , it is obvious that the baryon / meson enhancement for non - charm hadrons and charm hadrons can be significantly different . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our aim is neither to investigate these differences nor to quantify the magnitude of the charm baryon / meson enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> this would require a sophisticated theoretical investigation which goes clearly beyond the scope of this paper and , to our knowledge , no information on this topic is available in the literature yet . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the following , we only assume that , in view of experimental results on the baryon / meson enhancement for non - strange and strange hadrons , a similar enhancement is a priori conceivable for charm hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , such an enhancement has strong implications on the nuclear modification factor of non - photonic electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to a decrease of the yield of non - photonic electrons in @xmath8 collisions because , as shown in tab .  [ tab_pdg ] , the inclusive semi - leptonic decay branching ratio of charm baryons is smaller than that of charm mesons ( and the hadronization process does not change the total charm quark number ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the nuclear modification factor of non - photonic electrons should decrease as well . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily illustrated in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that a @xmath8 collision is a perfect sum of @xmath10 collisions ( i.e. @xmath25 ) and that the relative yields of @xmath3 mesons are the same in @xmath10 and in @xmath8 collisions , a @xmath2 integrated @xmath7 can be calculated for different @xmath26 enhancement factors @xmath27 according to @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 is the charm hadron yield and @xmath31 is the hadron semi - leptonic decay branching ratio . according to tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab_pdg ] , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 such that @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> enhancement factors @xmath37 of 5 and 12 therefore lead to a @xmath7 of 0.90 and 0.79 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown below that the effect is further amplified in the intermediate @xmath2 range as a result of a softer decay electron spectrum of @xmath23 as compared to that of @xmath3 mesons .    in order to investigate this effect in more details , we have performed simple simulations with the pythia-6.152  @xcite event generator . </S>",
    "<S> the pythia input parameters were first tuned according to  @xcite and the phenix acceptance cut ( @xmath38 ) was applied in order to correctly reproduce the @xmath2 distribution of non - photonic electrons measured in @xmath10 collisions at @xmath39  @xcite . as it can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_eldndpt ] , the agreement between the simulation and the data is rather good except at very low @xmath2 and in the high @xmath2 region where the simulation under - predicts the data . </S>",
    "<S> the disagreement in the high @xmath2 region is due to the fact that we consider , in the simulation , only electrons from charm decay and neglect electrons from bottom decay which are expected to dominate the spectrum for @xmath40  @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it can be observed from tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab_pdg ] that the @xmath26 ratio amounts to 7.3% ( in @xmath41 ) and , as mentionned above , to 3.63% after convolution of the species yields with their corresponding semi - leptonic decay branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_dratios ] shows that , in the @xmath1 @xmath2 region of interest discussed hereafter , this ratio is even smaller ( @xmath42 ) because the decay electron spectrum of @xmath23 is softer than that of @xmath3 mesons . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> an enhancement of the @xmath26 ratio in central heavy ion collisions induces two different mechanisms of non - photonic electron yield suppression : i ) integrated yields are suppressed due to the lower semi - electronic branching ratio of the @xmath23 and ii ) the softer electron @xmath2 distribution from @xmath23 decay leads to an additional suppression at intermediate @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we then re - evaluate the non - photonic electron decay spectrum after introducing a @xmath26 enhancement chosen to 5 and 12 . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is assumed to be flat in @xmath2 and it is applied such that the @xmath2-differential charm cross - section is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is an arbitrary choice that could be justified since most of the charm hadron transverse momentum is given by the charm quark whatever , baryon or meson , this hadron is . </S>",
    "<S> we finally compute the @xmath7 ratio from the previous non - photonic electron @xmath2 spectra neglecting all effects like shadowing or quenching but assuming that the only medium induced effect is the @xmath26 enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear modification factor is therefore simply obtained from the ratio of the non - photonic electron @xmath2 distribution with a @xmath26 enhancement to the original distribution . by doing so , one implicitly takes into account the @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath26 ratio which is not flat ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dratios ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_raa ] together with the phenix data . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated @xmath7 ratio is shown only for @xmath14 since shadowing and electrons from bottom decay , which play an important role at lower and higher @xmath2 respectively , are not considered in the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_raa ] that a @xmath26 enhancement of 5 can already explain @xmath43 of the suppression of non - photonic electrons in the @xmath1 @xmath2 range . for illustration , we show that , in the extreme scenario of an enhancement of 12 , the data can be satisfactorily described without invoking any heavy - quark energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the simulated @xmath7 is obviously determined by the @xmath2 distribution of @xmath26 enhancement that we have assumed to be flat . </S>",
    "<S> note that the values of @xmath7 at @xmath44 can be roughly obtained as well from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dratios ] and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq1 ] and  [ eq2 ] , assuming that the decay electrons at @xmath44 originate from charm hadrons with @xmath40 . in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that an enhancement of the @xmath26 ratio in heavy ion collisions has dramatic consequences on the nuclear modification factor of non - photonic electrons . </S>",
    "<S> such an enhancement , which is observed for non - strange and strange hadrons , would significantly lower the @xmath7 of non - photonic electrons ( or muons ) at intermediate @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this results from i ) the semi - leptonic decay branching ratio of charm baryons which is smaller than that of charm mesons and ii ) the decay lepton spectrum from charm baryons which is softer than that of charm mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is therefore premature to interpret the non - photonic electron @xmath7 data before a possible enhancement of the @xmath26 ratio is measured experimentally and/or investigated theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> heavy quark energy loss can be studied in a much cleaner way from the nuclear modification factor of exclusively reconstructed charm hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> such measurements should be possible with the rhic - ii experiments  @xcite and with the alice experiment at the lhc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we finally note that the @xmath26 enhancement can possibly influence the elliptic flow of non - photonic electrons as well . </S>"
