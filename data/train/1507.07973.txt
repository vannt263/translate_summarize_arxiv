    "clay minerals have a complex layered structure with exchangeable cations that can bind water molecules in the interlayers . with increasing pressure and temperature , or in the presence of polar free radicals",
    ", these interlayer cations can be exchanged .",
    "this cation excahange capacity ( cec ) of clay minerals affects their fluid conductivity,@xcite and permeability@xcite ; dielectric permittivity.@xcite complex dielectric properties of clay are crucial to determine hydrocarbon - contents in oil - rich rocks .",
    "these measurements have been made predominantly at frequencies in the khz - range@xcite and between 0.5 mhz and 1.1 ghz.@xcite complex conductivity of clayey materials between 1 milli - hertz ( mhz ) and 45 khz for cec effects has been characterized and modeled.@xcite @xcite researched dielectric properties of smectite clay samples in detail , explaining interlayer polarization and relaxation mechanisms between 30 khz-300 mhz . some clay minerals can swell due to hydration with water adsorbed in the interlayer depends on the charge of the interlayer cations .",
    "electrical measurements can yield cation mobility .",
    "dielectric measurements can be instrumental to characterize the water absorbed in smectites@xcite the conductivities of smectite clays saturated by monovalent cations has also been studied in detail.@xcite these frequency - and temperature - dependent measurements were in the frequency range between 300 hz and 10 khz , and from -150@xmath10c to + 30@xmath10c . in a much higher frequency domain ,",
    "the thz dielectric constants of layered silicates including muscovite , vermiculite , phlogopite , and biotite , have been measured by thz - time domain spectroscopy.@xcite unfortunately this technique is fairly noisy and low resolution since the thz pulses are very weak .",
    "so , in this paper we look at monmorillionite using much higher resolution cw methods based on harmonic multiplication of phase stabilized microwaves , electronically generated ; these methods provide very low noise / high dynamic range out to about 1.4 thz at present .",
    "at csm we use three millimeter wave ( or sub - thz ) modalities to extract material properties : ( 1 ) a quasi - optical system,@xcite to study bulk properties , ( 2 ) a near field scanning system,@xcite to measure local properties , and ( 3 ) the open hemispherical cavity resonator,@xcite for samples that are too thin or too low - loss for quasi - optical techniques . in this work ,",
    "using cavity resonance perturbation , we extract the complex dielectric constants of clay - thin films in 100 - 165 ghz and investigate electrical properties in the presence of ca@xmath2/na@xmath1-ions .",
    "we study how these cations influence conductivity of free carriers , and relaxations .",
    "we also compare our data with low frequency measurements.@xcite    we use an open hemispherical cavity resonator with vna ( vector network analyzer)@xcite to measure electrical properties of thin sections of clay - samples with ca@xmath2/na@xmath1-ions infused .",
    "the cavity is a structure with two copper mirrors positioned at certain distance ( the `` cavity length '' ) without any sidewalls .",
    "the top mirror is hemispherical and connected to two wr-10 waveguide couplers working as a transmitter and a receiver , and on the other hand the lower mirror is flat and smaller than the upper one in size .",
    "we measured the real part of refractive index of @xmath3 1 mm - thick glass substrate ( borosillicate ) to be 1.98 at 310 ghz which is the same as its published value.@xcite for details on the cavity and methodology see @xcite .",
    "the principle of this technique is cavity perturbation .",
    "the changes in axissymetric mode profiles , mainly the frequency - shift and linewidth - variation , between an empty cavity mode and the same mode in presence of a sample , allows us to determine the complex dielectric constant of the sample.@xcite the unloaded ( empty ) cavity has an axisymmetric mode spacing that is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance between two mirrors , also known as cavity length . in our cavity , since @xmath12 is around 15 cm , the unloaded mode spacing is about 1ghz .",
    "putting a sample on the bottom mirror perturbs the modes in a calculable but nontrivial way . to avoid geometrical factors , we do a second perturbation which involves flipping the sample upside down .",
    "since the boundary values of the e - field are different , we are able to get a simple ( geometry - free ) formula for the complex permittivity from 3 sweeps around a 00q mode .",
    "this complex dielectric permittivity is related to total electrical / optical conductivity and absorption coefficient@xcite with the use of basic theory of electromagnetism as @xmath13 where n@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the real part of the refractive index and conductivity ( in @xmath16@xmath0 ) , @xmath6 is imaginary part of the complex dielectric constant , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are frequency and absorption coefficient expressed in terms wave numbers ( @xmath0 relative to the speed of light ) , so 1@xmath0 corresponds to 30 ghz .",
    "the electrical conductivity is a macroscopic quantity which can be due to bound electrons ( which is responsible for polarization and relaxation ) or free electrons ( which is drude - type mechanism ) .",
    "this is also valid for absorption coefficient .",
    "these parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath18 , essentially describe the loss mechanisms in a material .     and ( b)na@xmath1-ions ( at room temperature),title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] [ fig : subf1 ]   and ( b)na@xmath1-ions ( at room temperature),title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] [ fig : subf2 ]    .",
    "[ fig : f12 ]      by sweeping the vna , we identified the axissymetric empty cavity modes based on constant frequency - spacing .",
    "this fixes the cavity - length , l , to be 145.56 mm and kept it unchanged throughout the experiments . using a least - squares fit of the data to a breit - wigner model ( as described in @xcite )",
    "we retrieve the eigenfrequency - shifts and modal quality factors ( q - values related to a linewidth ) for substrate - only , film up and film down positions in order to apply the differential method . in order to determine uncertainty in the experiment",
    ", we repeat the entire procedure of inserting the sample , performing the measurements , and taking it out six times and calculating the variations in frequency shifts and linewidth changes of substrate . in @xcite",
    "we showed that by re - doing the entire procedure six times for borosillicate glass substrate , we obtained standard deviations less than 1.0% in the complex dielectric constant .",
    "this uncertainty also propagates to the calculations of dielectric constant . for consistency we confirmed during each trial that the same part of the samples is probed .",
    "the frequency shifts due to film up , film down , and substrate only are used in the eqs.([equ : differentialtech ] ) to determine the real part of the refractive index of a thin film.@xcite this is called the differential method since it involves measurements with the sample film up and down ; the film will then see a different field because of the boundary conditions .",
    "the result is that sample geometry factors cancel out , greatly simplifying the calculation .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer , respectively to the refractive index of the film and substrate being measured",
    ". then one can show that @xmath21 with @xmath22 @xmath23 here , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 represent the eigenfrequency associated with the film on the top ( film up ) , film at the bottom ( film down ) , and the substrate only , respectively .",
    "the term , @xmath27 , stands for the difference between the eigenfrequencies associated with film at the bottom of the substrate and the substrate only , and the term , @xmath28 , is the difference between the eigenfrequencies with the film at the top of substrate and the substrate only .",
    "the required condition is the real part of the refractive index of substrate must be known .",
    "( or since the substrate is large enough , we can measure its permittivity directly using the quasi - optical methodology .",
    "the real part of the dielectric constant of thin film can obtained by @xmath29=(n@xmath30 .",
    "we need q - values of film up and substrate ( only ) to calculate the imaginary part of complex dielectric constant of the thin film .",
    "the q - value of a resonant peak ( perturbation ) is defined as q=@xmath31/@xmath32 .",
    "the q - value is related to the imaginary part of the refractive index by n@xmath33=1/2q , so for a thin film , n@xmath34=1/2q@xmath35 .",
    "the latter expressions assume that q is not too small ( say less than 10 ) . in a cavity such as ours ,",
    "the q could be @xmath36 depending on technical details of the waveguide coupling .",
    "in the differential method , q@xmath37 q@xmath38 q@xmath39 .",
    "now , we are able to compute the imaginary part of the complex dielectric constant of the thin film by @xmath40 .     and na@xmath1-ion stabilized clay samples used in em analysis.,width=529 ]      we studied smectite clay minerals ( swy ) from the clay minerals society ( @xmath41 ) that were treated to yield homoionic , univalent ( na@xmath1 ) and divalent ( ca@xmath2 ) samples .",
    "the samples were treated to remove carbonate and iron oxide cements with a na - acetate buffer and na - dithionite respectively.@xcite the sub-0.5 @xmath4 m equivalent spherical diameter size fractions were separated from bulk samples by standard centrifuge methods . then the na@xmath1 saturated clay was thoroughly cleaned with dialysis to remove excess salt . to prepare the ca@xmath2 exchanged smectite ,",
    "a dialyzed na@xmath1 sample was treated with a 1 m solution of cacl@xmath42 , and shaken for at least two hours , excess solution was decanted and the process was repeated twice more .",
    "the excess ca@xmath2 salt was removed with dialysis.@xcite oriented aggregates were made by evaporation onto glass slides to provide a sample @xmath3 4 cm long with at least 10 mg/@xmath43 of clay.@xcitethis evaporation method yields deposition of clay particles on the glass slide with the clay layers parallel to the glass slide.@xcite        xrd measurements showed systematic differences between na@xmath1 smectite and ca@xmath2 smectite .",
    "the structure of smectite determined from oriented aggregate sample preparations and x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) profile modelling and especially the interlayer water complex under different environmental conditions , is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the influence that the structure and organization of interlayer water has on the material s dielectric constant .",
    "for this reason , the diffraction profiles from the na@xmath1 and ca@xmath2 exchanged preparations used in the dielectric measurements in this study were simulated following the same methods as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the experimental and modelled diffraction patterns for the na@xmath1 and ca@xmath2-ion stabilized clay samples are shown in fig.[fig:2 ] along with the thicknesses of bihydrated ( 2w ) , monohydrated ( 1w ) and dehydrated ( 0w ) layers and their proportions that were used in the simulated diffraction profiles . under the ambient conditions of @xmath3 50@xmath44 relative himidity ( rh ) in the laboratory the na@xmath1 smectite",
    "is well described by random interstratifications of 2w ( 2@xmath44 ) , 1w ( 85@xmath44 ) , and 0w ( 13@xmath44 ) .",
    "in contrast , the hydrated structure of ca@xmath2 smectite was modelled by a different arrangement of layer thicknesses and proportions where 2w ( 81@xmath44 ) , 1w ( 9@xmath44 ) , and 0w ( 10@xmath44 ) were randomly interstratified .",
    "the xrd simulations in fig.[fig:2 ] are not perfect with some misfit present at different angular ranges for the ca@xmath2 and na@xmath1 samples .",
    "this suggests that there is greater heterogeneity in the layer assemblage .",
    "however , the near perfect fit of the 001 reflection at 12.54  ( na ) and 15.05  ( ca ) , and the generally good fit at higher angles indicate that the models represent the primary structures , with 1w layers being dominant in the na@xmath1 sample and 2w layers being the dominant layer type in the ca@xmath2 sample .",
    "smectite interlayer water as probed by xrd , considered crystalline water,@xcite may or may not all be coordinated to interlayer cations .",
    "based on a combination of xrd and grand - canonical monte carlo simulations@xcite found that fluctuations of charge locations and water dipoles affect the dielectric constant .",
    "these authors also point out that gravimetric adsorption methods produce similar , but slightly higher molar equivalent water content than xrd experiments conducted under the same humidity conditions and based on the xrd simulation method .",
    "this is due to additional adsorption on surfaces and condensation in nm - scale pores .",
    "thus , in addition to millimeter wave em analysis , we performed a variety of measurements on the two samples , including thermal gravimetric analysis ( tga ) , gravimetric water adsorption , and subcritical nitrogen gas adsorption ( sga ) to characterize physical differences that exist between the na@xmath1 and ca@xmath2 ex - infused samples .",
    "na@xmath1 smectite has higher ssa and dominant 1 - 3 nm pores typical for clay aggregates ; in contrast , the ca@xmath2 smectite sample has predominantly larger pores between 50 - 100 nm.@xcite at @xmath3 50 rh gravimetric water adsorption data ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) from swy - ca@xmath2 and swy - na@xmath1 showed that the ca@xmath2 smectite adsorbed @xmath3 17.5 wt.@xmath44 following dehydration at 60@xmath45c for 3 hours , compared to 10 wt.@xmath44 for the na@xmath1 smectite under the same conditions .",
    "the hydration enthalpy is about four times greater for ca@xmath2 than na@xmath1 cations and is consistent with these gravimetric data .",
    "however , in the oriented aggregate preparations used for the em analysis the contrasting structural arrangement of the interlayer crystalline water between the na@xmath1 and ca@xmath2 smectite samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) must play a significant role in the em response.@xcite     [ fig : subf3 ]    [ fig : subf4 ]    [ fig : subf5 ]",
    "referring to fig.[fig : f345 ] , one can see that the real part of the dielectric constants of both clay samples are nearly dispersion free ( i.e. , frequency independent ) in our range of measurements , indicating that carrier concentrations are low in both.@xcite the imaginary part of dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of na@xmath1-ionized sample , increase at two different rates : faster in the higher frequency range of our measurement and slower at low frequencies .",
    "the presence of both debye relaxation@xcite , and maxwell - wagner relaxation@xcite at radio frequencies has been reported.@xcite but between 100 and 165 ghz , phonon induced relaxation is dominant.@xcite    @xcite proposed a theoretical model to study complex conductivity - dependences on cation exchange capacity ( cec ) , specific surface area ( ssa ) , and salinity for clay samples at low frequency .",
    "this model also relates cec to ssa with consistency.@xcite it is reported that ssa increases exponentially for na@xmath1-clay and linearly for ca@xmath2-clay sample.@xcite from our research , it is evident that conductivity depends on cec or ssa .",
    "the larger cec or expnonetial - growing ssa can contribute to more disperse stern layer and the smaller cec or linearly - progressive ssa stabilize the stern layer .",
    "thus , electrical conductivity is linked to cec and zeta potential in the stern layer.@xcite the na@xmath1 makes a thicker unstable double layer where these high mobility ions are able to polarize rapidly .",
    "therefore , the conductivity is more dispersive .",
    "this interlayer polarization is correlated to relaxation mechanisms .",
    "the relaxation processes are , therefore , dependent of @xmath9-potential which is also correlated to cec.@xcite on the other hand , the imaginary part of dielectric constant and conductivity of the sample with ca@xmath2 increase monotonically and sublinearly .",
    "the ca@xmath2 creates more stable double stern layer . due to low mobility ,",
    "the interlayer polarization is less disperse so its conductivity is sublinear . since , @xmath6 = 2 ( 1/@xmath46 ) @xmath15 , the effect of ( 1/@xmath46 ) is more into imaginary part of complex dielectric constant of samples with na@xmath2 than that of ca@xmath2 . in this case",
    ", @xmath6 at high frequencies faced steeper decrease than at lower frequency ends .    comparing the results from @xcite with ours ( fig.[fig : f345 ] ) , it is clear that in the sub - thz , the electrical conductivities of clay - na@xmath1/ca@xmath2-ions are almost 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than in the rf / microwave range . on the other hand , the real part of dielectric constants for both samples , are roughly an order of magnitude larger in the rf / microwave range than in the sub - thz .",
    "the huge rf / microwave permittivities have been attributed to polarization of the double - layer surrounding the ions.@xcite the lower ( and nearly frequency - independent ) values of @xmath5 suggest that there are depletions of mobile charges due to phonon interactions causing the diffused layers to thin .",
    "we measured sub - thz complex dielectric properties of clay samples with na@xmath1/ca@xmath2 , and compute their @xmath5 and @xmath15 .",
    "we illustrate the connections between electromagnetic parameters and components of surface chemistry such as cec or ssa , @xmath9-potential .",
    "this also enables us to study the clay content and free radicals in shales , and to investigate their cec and @xmath9-potential - dependences . in future",
    ", we will study more different ionized clay samples and broader frequency ranges to capture more complete frequency - dependences of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this will allow us to model computationally the dispersions of these parameters .",
