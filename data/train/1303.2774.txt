    "benefit from the available and increasing spatial degrees of freedom , multicell networks exploit different forms of intercell cooperation to operate the system in an interference - aware manner @xcite . due to practical constraints such as limited feedback @xcite and the finite capacity of the backhaul @xcite , beamforming level coordination and efficient power control strategies",
    "are favored over data level cooperation and nonlinear precoding approaches @xcite to effectively scale up the system performance .",
    "considering these practical constraints , two characteristics are appealing to joint beamforming and power control algorithms design : distributed computation and fast - convergent algorithms with low complexity .",
    "the desired distributed feature addresses system scalability , and the distributed algorithm only relies on local channel state information ( csi ) which can be obtained by uplink measurement in a time division duplex ( tdd ) system or through user feedback in a frequency division duplex ( fdd ) system . on the other hand ,",
    "simple algorithms possessing fast convergence rate are attractive in that they reduce the message passing overhead and alleviate the finite backhaul constraint .",
    "the algorithm design is intimately related to the system performance metric of interest .",
    "different system performance metrics reflect different design priorities .",
    "one common approach is to maximize the sum rate of the system .",
    "however , due to the non - convexity of the problem , numerically finding the optimal solution is challenging and the design of distributed algorithms that can compute the global optimal solution efficiently is still open , e.g. , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is known that two specific problem formulations admit global optimal solutions : the transmit power minimization subject to signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) constraints , and the maximization of minimum @xmath0 subject to power constraints .",
    "the former problem whose priority is energy saving has been addressed extensively in the literature and efficient algorithms have been proposed for both the single cell and multicell systems @xcite .",
    "the analysis of single cell downlink relies on the well - known uplink - downlink duality @xcite which is readily interpreted by the lagrange duality in convex optimization . in @xcite ,",
    "the duality is observed for the mimo multiuser ad hoc network setting , and in @xcite , the duality is extended to the multicell setting .",
    "the literature for the latter problem which aims to enforce the fairness level of the system is comparatively less .",
    "the max - min @xmath0 problem was first addressed in @xcite using an extended coupling matrix approach , and a centralized algorithm was proposed in @xcite , which involves an increased dimension matrix computation .",
    "a reformulation of the max - min problem is analyzed in @xcite by conic programming and a heuristic algorithm is provided . in @xcite ,",
    "similar to @xcite , the max - min problem is tackled from the transmit power minimization perspective and a hierarchical iterative algorithm is proposed .",
    "recently , the problem was studied in @xcite using a nonlinear perron - frobenius theory @xcite , and a distributed algorithm was proposed that exhibits the distributed power control ( dpc ) structure in @xcite .",
    "the dpc - like structure is independent of parameter configuration , thus enabling the application of the power control module in @xcite already used in practical cellular systems .",
    "the approach @xcite is extended to the mimo downlink in @xcite wherein the convergence of a heuristic algorithm in @xcite is proved , and a power optimization problem under multiple power constraint is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the optimization of the egalitarian fairness i.e. , max - min , performance metric also has intimate relationship with other important wireless network performance metric optimization problem , e.g. , the weighted sum rate maximization @xcite .",
    "the sum rate maximization is nonconvex and np - hard , and the implication is that fast egalitarian fairness algorithms can be leveraged to solve this nonconvex problem with global optimality guaranteed under special cases .",
    "herein , we firstly extend the analysis in @xcite to the multicell setting with multiple serving users per cell . the duality between primal and dual network",
    "is derived and characterized by the perron - frobenius theory .",
    "a distributed algorithm is also proposed which possesses geometrically fast convergence rate .    the designed algorithm , though converging to the optimal solution , requires instantaneous power update within the coordinated cluster through backhaul .",
    "this instantaneous information exchange may become prohibitive when the number of transmit antennas at base station as well as the serving users per cell grow large .",
    "in such emerging large - scale multiple antenna systems @xcite , the backhaul capability may turn into the bottleneck . in order to alleviate this problem and to enable",
    "simplified design that utilizes only the statistical channel information , additional tools from random matrix theory @xcite are to be leveraged .",
    "the large system analysis for linear receiver design in the uplink was initiated in @xcite , and the notion of effective interference and effective bandwidth was proposed . in @xcite , asymptotic analysis for the transmit power minimization problem",
    "is carried out .",
    "the approaches in @xcite and @xcite decouple beamforming and power control by assuming zero - forcing or regularized zero - forcing beamformers @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite examines the max - min @xmath0 problem from the transmit power minimization perspective , and compares several cooperation strategies by assuming a two - cell model with homogeneous channel setting .",
    "the analysis is extended in @xcite for the minimization of the maximum power problem with homogeneous channel setting . in this paper",
    ", we perform large system analysis for the max - min @xmath0 problem in a general multicell setting . utilizing tools developed from random matrix theory ,",
    "the deterministic equivalents @xcite for the dual network @xmath0 and for the primal network @xmath0 are established .",
    "these asymptotic approximations are used to compute the asymptotic power which only relies on statistical channel information .",
    "intuitively , in a large - scale multiple antenna system , the optimal powers for different users would approach different deterministic values and the obtained power can be utilized for optimal beamformer design with local csi . moreover , by using nonlinear perron - frobenius theory and random matrix theory , we observe an effective network for the dual network and an effective network for the primal network , which capture the characteristic of the power control effect in the large system setting .",
    "the established effective network is further leveraged to provide a distributed algorithm with fast convergence rate .    to summarize , the contributions of this paper are three - fold : 1 ) analysis and algorithm design for joint optimal beamforming and power control in a finite multicell system to maximize the minimum weighted @xmath0 , 2 ) the established effective network to characterize the algebraic structure of the power control problem in the large system setting , and 3 ) low complexity algorithm design which requires no instantaneous backhaul exchange .",
    "all these contributions lead to efficient methodologies to design algorithms for the large - scale coordinated multicell downlink .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ system ] presents the system model .",
    "the finite system analysis is provided in section [ finite ] .",
    "section [ large ] carries out large system analysis and derives the asymptotic solution .",

    "finally , section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "notations in this paper are presented as follows .",
    "boldface upper - case letters denote matrices , boldface lower - case letters denote vectors , and italics denote scalars .",
    "the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of a nonnegative matrix @xmath1 is denoted as @xmath2 .",

    "consider a coordinated multicell downlink formulated by @xmath20 coordinating base stations utilizing the same carrier frequency .",
    "each base station is equipped with @xmath21 transmit antennas and serves @xmath22 users simultaneously . herein , the focus is on the base station side interference coordination , and each user is assumed to have a single antenna .",
    "the received signal @xmath23 for user @xmath24 in cell @xmath25 is written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the channel vector from cell @xmath28 towards user @xmath24 in cell @xmath25 , @xmath29 is the transmitted signal vector of cell @xmath28 , and @xmath30 characterizes the additive white noise effect and any intercell interference not included in the coordinated cluster for user @xmath24 in cell @xmath25 , which is distributed as @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "linear beamforming strategy is assumed at the base station , and thus the transmit signal vector @xmath33 for cell @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 represents the signal intended for stream @xmath24 of cell @xmath25 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the information signal and the transmit power for that stream , and @xmath38 denotes the normalized transmit beamformer for user @xmath24 in cell @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath0 for user @xmath24 in cell @xmath25 can be written as @xmath40 where the superscript @xmath41 represents the primal downlink network .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the weight associated with @xmath43 for user @xmath24 in cell @xmath25 illustrating different power prices , and denote @xmath44 as the priority factor associated with @xmath45 for user @xmath24 in cell @xmath25 demonstrating diverse service priorities .",
    "then the max - min problem under weighted sum power constraint can be written as follows @xmath46 the problem ( [ system_eq_3 ] ) appears non - convex at first , but can be transformed into a second - order cone program @xcite by applying methods similar to that in @xcite , which admits a global optimal solution . however , employing standard convex optimization methods to find the optimal solution typically requires centralized computation and incurs a fair amount of parameter tuning and message passing overhead that may not be practical in wireless networks .",
    "thus in section [ finite ] , we will employ nonlinear perron - frobenius theory to propose dpc - like algorithm @xcite that does not require parameter tuning and has geometrically - fast convergence rate .",
    "then in section [ large ] , algorithms that are even simpler and more practical for systems with a large number of transmit antennas and users will be presented by performing an asymptotic analysis .",

    "essentially regards an interference network with @xmath47 users .",
    "however , the formulation in terms of the channel @xmath48 and the link gain @xmath49 does not easily lead to amenable analysis . in order to construct the @xmath50 cross channel interference matrix , consider the matrix @xmath51 with subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath52 , whose entry can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the ceil and floor operation respectively .",
    "thus the channel @xmath48 can be represented with subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath52 : @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , define the power vector @xmath57 as @xmath58 , and the beamforming matrix as @xmath59 with @xmath60 . the general formulation in ( [ finite_eq_1 ] )",

    "the former case refers to a single cell downlink with @xmath22 interfering users , while the latter case corresponds to an ad hoc interference network setting with @xmath20 transmitter - receiver pairs or a multicell setting with one user served per cell . by the formulation of @xmath63 ,",
    "the cross channel interference matrix , denoted by @xmath64 can be obtained by @xmath65 similarly , the weight vector @xmath66 , the priority vector @xmath67 , and the noise vector @xmath68 can be defined by : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . from the aforementioned mapping , if we denote the @xmath0 vector as @xmath72 with @xmath73 , and the auxiliary vector @xmath74 with @xmath75 , then the optimization problem ( [ system_eq_3 ] ) can be readily reformulated as follows : @xmath76 it can be shown that solving ( [ finite_eq_3 ] ) is equivalent to solving ( [ system_eq_3 ] ) . the compact formulation in ( [ finite_eq_3 ] ) introduces a nonnegative matrix @xmath77 , whose algebraic structure helps in establishing the network duality and is pursued next .",
    "the analytic structure in ( [ finite_eq_3 ] ) is similar to the formulation in @xcite for the single cell multiuser downlink scenario . in @xcite , the uplink - downlink duality",
    "is proved by a geometric programming formulation and the lagrange duality .",
    "herein , we provide a network duality interpretation for the max - min based multicell scenario via perron - frobenius characterization .    for",

    "it is known that at optimality , the weighted @xmath0 for different users are the same , and the weighted power constraint becomes tight @xcite .",
    "now if we explicitly make the dependence on @xmath78 and denote the optimal weighted @xmath0 as @xmath79 , then the optimal power solution satisfies @xcite : @xmath80 from ( [ finite_eq_4 ] ) , it can be shown from nonnegative matrix theory @xcite that @xmath81 is the perron ( right ) eigenvector ( up to a scaling factor ) of the nonnegative matrix @xmath82 , namely , @xmath83 , and @xmath79 is related to its spectral radius by the following : @xmath84    now , in order to establish the network duality , consider the hypothesized dual uplink network by construction .",
