    "the evolution of a single population into two or more species without prevention of gene flow through geographic segregation is known as sympatric speciation @xcite .",
    "cichlid fishes , _ amphilophus zaliosus _ , are one possible example of evolution by sympatric speciation in nature @xcite .",
    "the midas cichlid species complex @xcite are distributed in the great lakes of nicaragua as well as in several crater lakes in the area .",
    "combined , they represent by far the largest biomass of any fish species in nicaragua freshwaters",
    ". there are substantial morphological differences between them , for example , some of them have cryptic colouring , grey or brown with dark bars or spots , known as normal morph , or a conspicuous form , which lacks melanophores , resulting in brightly red , orange , or yellowish coloured fish , gold morph .",
    "cichlid fishes are also characterized by a pair of jaws in the pharyngeal area in addition to the oral jaws , and this key innovation is presumed to be responsible for their great ability to colonize new habitats and to exploit successfully a large diversity of trophic niches .",
    "three different species have already been recognized @xcite within the midas cichlid complex : 1.- _ amphilophus labiatus _ , the red devil cichlid , a fleshy - lipped species thought to be restricted to the big lakes lake nicaragua and lake managua , 2.- _",
    "a. zaliosus _ , the arrow cichlid , an elongated species that is restricted in its distribution to one of the crater lakes , lake apoyo , and 3.- _ amphilophus citrinellus _ , the midas cichlid , a generalist species with very widespread distribution . for _ a. citrinellus _",
    ", a polychromatism has been described @xcite , with normal and gold morphs .",
    "strong assortative mating according to colour has been observed as well @xcite , both in the field and in captivity , suggesting that sexual selection maintains the colour polymorphism .",
    "two types of pharyngeal jaws of _",
    "citrinellus _ have been described @xcite , a papilliform morph with slender pointed teeth and a mollariform morph with thicker rounded teeth .",
    "these previous studies showed that there is a trade - off in performance : the mollariform fish are specialized and more efficient at eating hard diets such as snails , whereas they are less efficient in feeding on soft diets than the papilliform morphs and vice versa . for _",
    "a. labiatus _",
    ", the same polychromatism has been described @xcite , with normal and gold morphs , and only papilliform pharyngeal jaws have been documented .",
    "a. zaliosus _ have cryptic colouring , normal morph , and are polymorphic with papilliform and mollariform pharyngeal , fig .",
    "[ fig : conjuntos ] .        according to theoretical models",
    "@xcite , sympatric speciation is driven by disruptive frequency - dependent natural selection , caused by competition for diverse resources @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some authors have argued that sexual selection can also cause sympatric speciation @xcite .",
    "cichlids are renowned for their vast diversity of trophic morphologies and often extreme degree of ecological specialization @xcite",
    ". however , the sympatric occurrence of many sibling species that seem to differ only in colouring makes it unlikely for ecological specialization to be the sole mechanism of speciation in this group . at the same time , genetic data @xcite show that sympatric speciation by sexual selection alone is rather unlikely for the speciation case of the crater lake apoyo .",
    "we studied the ecological , mating and genetic conditions needed to reproduce the polychromatism and polymorphism of the three species of the midas cichlid species complex , fig . [",
    "fig : conjuntos ] .",
    "our study was based on simulations of an individual - based model where natural selection caused by competition for diverse resources and sexual selection , tuned by strength parameters on two quantitative and independent traits , were considered .",
    "our results show two scenarios for the sympatric speciation of _",
    "citrinellus _ species , one with and the other without disruptive natural selection . in the first scenario , _",
    "_ develops jaw polymorphism while retaining a single colour morph , while in the second _ a. labiatus _ develops polychromatism with a single jaw morph .",
    "the individuals genomes are represented by three pairs of bitstrings , each of them consisting of a computer word of 32 bits .",
    "the first pair is age - structured and contains the information of when , between 1 and 32 time steps , the individual would die if only genetic diseases were considered @xcite .",
    "the second pair delineates the ability of the individual to survive under a competition for the available resources , representing an ecological trait such as the types of pharyngeal jaws in the case of cichlid fishes .",
    "the third pair represents a trait only related to sexual selection , a mating trait , such as the colour of cichlid fishes . at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "all individuals are born with random genomes .",
    "when a female succeeds in staying alive until reaching a minimum reproduction age , @xmath0 , it looks for a male to mate with and generates @xmath1 offspring every time step before dying , with a new choice for a mate being done at each time step .",
    "the first pair of the offspring s genome is constructed in the following way : each one of the first pair of strings of the male , for instance , is broken at the same random position and the complementary pieces , originated from different strings , are joined to form two male gametes .",
    "one of the gametes is then randomly chosen to be passed on to the offspring .",
    "after that , one random bad mutation is introduced into this gamete , and the final result corresponds to one string of the new individual .",
    "the other string is constructed from the first pair of the female s strings by the same process , that simulates random crossover , recombination and addition of one bad mutation .      in the present model , competition for food",
    "is related to a phenotype , @xmath2 , represented by the second , non age - structured , pair of bit - strings , which is constructed in the same way as the first pair of the individual genome .",
    "this phenotypic characteristic is computed by counting the number of bit positions where both bits are set to @xmath3 , plus the number of dominant positions ( chosen as @xmath4 ) with at least one of the two bits set .",
    "it will therefore be a number @xmath2 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which we will refer to as the individual s phenotype .",
    "we call @xmath7 the mutation probability per locus of this ecological trait",
    ". a mutation can change the locus either from @xmath5 to @xmath3 or from @xmath3 to @xmath5 . in order to control the population s size and introduce a competition we used the verhulst factor , @xmath8 .",
    "we considered three intra - specific competitions , @xcite , depending on the individual s phenotype @xmath2 , each one related to a given phenotypic group : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two parameters of the simulation . at every time step , @xmath12 , and for each individual with phenotypic characteristic @xmath2 , a random real number uniformly distributed between @xmath5 and @xmath3 is generated ; if this number is smaller than @xmath8 , the individual dies .",
    "for the specialist groups the competition is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 accounts for the population with phenotype @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) at time @xmath12 , @xmath17 accounts for the population with phenotype @xmath18 $ ] , and @xmath19 is a resource distribution .",
    "individuals with intermediate phenotypes ( @xmath20 ) compete among themselves and also with a fraction @xmath21 of each specialist population .",

    "the first case , @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) , is used to simulate a scenario without disruptive selection on the ecological trait . for this case , all individuals have the same carrying capacity , eq .",
    "( [ extreme ] ) and eq .",

    "is related to another phenotype , @xmath34 , and was represented by a new pair of non age - structured bit - strings , the mating trait , that also obeys the general rules of crossing and recombination .",
    "this phenotype was computed in the same way as that for the ecological trait .",
    "it will therefore be a number @xmath34 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and we call @xmath35 the mutation probability per locus of this mating trait , which can also mutate back and forth between @xmath5 and @xmath3 . in order to consider assortative mating in a sympatric environment , we defined two phenotypic groups , one composed by the individuals that have @xmath36 while individuals of the other have @xmath37 $ ] . with some probability , @xmath38 $ ] , a female with phenotype @xmath34 will mate with a male of the same phenotypic group and with probability @xmath39 will mate with a male of the other phenotypic group , at each time step of its life .",
    "for instance , if a female has phenotype @xmath36 and a random real number , @xmath40 , uniformly distributed between @xmath5 and @xmath3 , is tossed that is smaller than @xmath41 , it selects its mate among @xmath42 males of the same phenotypic group @xmath36 by picking the one with the smallest phenotype value @xmath34 . if a female has phenotype @xmath36 and the random real number , @xmath40 , is larger than @xmath41 , it chooses a partner from the other phenotypic group , @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "a similar rule applies to females with @xmath37 $ ] , with the proviso that now the female picks as mate , among @xmath42 males of the same phenotypic group , the one with the largest phenotype value @xmath34 .",
    "the females with @xmath43 mate only with males of phenotype @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , the female population is not selective in mating ; that is , panmictic mating is the behaviour of the population . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the female population has a completely assortative mating behaviour .",
    "we present now simulation results for which the values of the parameters related to the first pairs of bitstring of the individuals genomes were chosen to be : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "( [ fatorall ] ) and each female chooses among @xmath51 males . we start the simulations with all bitstrings randomly filled with zeroes and ones .",
    "the initial populations typically consist of 60000 individuals , half males and half females .",
    "the equilibrium population sizes depend on the carrying capacity , but are never smaller than 38000 individuals .",
    "we took @xmath30 in the resource distribution , @xmath19 of eq .",

    "[ fig : labiatusm2 ] .",
    "that means , if the mutation probability of the mating trait , @xmath35 , has small values , the population suffers a genetic drift which becomes faster as the value of @xmath41 becomes larger , meaning that the behaviour of the female population is predominantly one of assortative mating . in other words , for strong assortative mating the disruption of the mating trait",

    "the characteristics of the _ a. zaliosus _ species is to have a unimodal distribution for the mating trait and a bimodal distribution for the ecological one .",

    "[ fig : zaliosus ] ( a ) and ( b ) we can see that the proper regions of parameters to simulate the speciation process of this species are @xmath76 , bimodal distribution for the ecological trait , and @xmath77 , unimodal one for the mating trait .      one way to obtain",
    "the polycromatism and polymorphism characteristic of the _ a. citrinellus _ species , bimodal distributions of the both traits , is to consider uniform distribution of resources without disruptive natural selection .",
    "we have already shown that simulations with @xmath78 and @xmath45 , only assortative mating , give a bimodal distribution for the mating trait , fig .",
    "[ fig : labiatus ] ( b ) , independently of the competition strength , @xmath21 , provided the mutation probability is @xmath79 .",
    "however , to obtain also bimodal distribution of the ecological trait , without disruptive natural selection , it is necessary to have @xmath67 , that is , a symmetric competition between specialist and intermediate phenotypes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : citrinellus1 ] .    for @xmath31 ,",
    "it is also possible to split both phenotype distributions , but then it is necessary to consider small mutation probabilities of the mating trait , @xmath59 , a weak assortative mating , @xmath80 , and proper values of the resource distribution , @xmath32 , depending on the competition strength , @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , @xmath81 for @xmath68 , fig [ fig : zaliosus ] ( a ) .",
    "although competition for resources and natural disruptive selection appear together in eq .",
    "( [ extreme ] ) and ( [ intermediate ] ) , they lead to rather different situations .",
    "while competition depends on the population sizes and affects equally individuals of the same phenotypic group , disruptive natural selection caused by resources distributions acts on each particular individual , according to its phenotype . as a result ,",
    "disruptive selection becomes more effective than competition .",
    "for instance , even for a panmictic behaviour , disruptive natural selection may lead to a splitting of both traits , depending only on the values of @xmath21 and @xmath32 , as already pointed in @xcite .",
    "a small mutation probability of the mating trait also favours this double splitting , as obtained in @xcite .    on the other hand , in order to split both phenotypic distributions without disruptive natural selection , @xmath30 , it is imperative to have sexual selection , and now the splitting process depends on the values of @xmath41 and @xmath21 , and in this case the mutation of the mating trait must be large in order to prevent genetic drift effects .",
    "anyway , the _ a. citrinellus _ case is the evolution of the splitting in both traits distributions must be driven by disruptive natural selection or by sexual selection , and the only statistical difference we found between these two scenarios is that the correlation between the traits is smaller when the splitting is driven by sexual selection .",
    "it so happens because the large mutation rate of the mating trait , mentioned above , introduces large fluctuations in this correlation .",
