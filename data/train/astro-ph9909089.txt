    "recently , enormous advances have been made in the field of sub - mm astronomy , most notably with the commissioning of scuba , the sub - mm common user bolometer array (; ) , on the james clark maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "the @xmath0 surveys of smail , ivison & blain ( 1997 ) , ( 1998 ) and ( 1998 ) suggest that the sub - mm counts show strong evidence of evolution .",
    "the sources detected at this wavelength appear to be dusty , high redshift galaxies .",
    "however , the origin of the emission is not clear , and these distant dusty galaxies could be powered by either starburst or agn activity .",
    "the question of which component dominates is highly important : if starbursts dominate , then it would imply that a significant amount of star - formation has been missed by studies which use ultra - violet techniques to claim that the star - formation rate ( sfr ) decreases in galaxies at high redshift @xcite .",
    "( 1996 ) have previously suggested that models which include dust with a monotonically _ increasing _ sfr towards higher redshift can also give good fits to faint galaxy counts and colours ( see also ; ; ; ) .",
    "it has also been known for some time that some ultraluminous infra - red galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which are strongly star - forming , dusty galaxies , also contain buried qso nuclei .",
    "images of ulirgs in polarized light have shown highly anisotropic structure , such as that observed in the galaxy , f10214 + 4724 , @xcite .",
    "similar polarization structure is seen in seyfert 2s and high redshift radio galaxies , which is thought to be indicative of non - uniform illumination consistent with the unified model of agn .",
    "it has been inferred that the qso and ulirg phenomena are closely related , with ulirgs being postulated as being type 2 objects , or `` qso-2s '' @xcite .",
    "genzel ( 1998 ) have made observations of ulirgs in order to determine which is the dominant emission mechanism at fir wavelengths .",
    "they find that @xmath1 per cent are powered by star - formation , while the remaining @xmath2 per cent are agn ( see also rigopoulou , lawrence & rowan - robinson 1996 ) .",
    "a massive dusty torus will also contain huge amounts of molecular gas , and therefore by definition will also be a prime site for star - formation .",
    "it has become increasingly evident that both agn and starburst activity are often present in the same object , and therefore it is nave to assume that the two processes are either independent or mutually exclusive .",
    "the first spectroscopic follow - up of the faint sub - mm sources tends to show a mixture of dusty starburst and agn .",
    "however , in obscured sources , it is frequently difficult spectroscopically to disentangle starburst from agn components .",
    "thus , in a scuba survey of four distant clusters of galaxies ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) , the brightest source , smm02399 - 0136 , was found to be a hyperluminous , active galaxy at redshift @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "( 1998 ) compare the measured @xmath4 ratio of this high redshift galaxy , smm02399 - 0136 @xcite , to that of the local starburst , arp220 , and find that it is twice as high . since the fir emission from arp220 is purely from merger - induced star - formation , they infer that approximately half of the fir emission from smm02399 - 0136 must therefore be due to a dust - enshrouded agn .",
    "further examples include the ultraluminous balqso , apm08279 + 5255 , which at @xmath5 is apparently the most luminous object currently known @xcite , and the sub - mm source b1933 + 503 , thought to be a high redshift ( @xmath6 ) dusty radio quasar @xcite .",
    "such surveys suggest that starburst galaxies dominate over agn at faint sub - mm fluxes , but the area of sky and number of sources detected is still quite small .    of course , large populations of such dust - enshrouded qsos and agn have been hypothesized in order to explain the observed shape of the x - ray background ( xrb ) spectrum ( madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ; ; ) .",
    "in addition , the hard x - ray source counts are considerably higher than at soft x - ray energies @xcite , implying the presence of an additional hard - spectrum population to the broad - line qsos known to make up the bulk of the sources at lower energies . however , one of the central features of obscured qso models is the presence of significant quantities of gas and dust surrounding the active nucleus , providing the means of absorbing a large fraction of the intrinsic radiation and affecting the observed properties in the optical and x - ray regimes .",
    "but this energy must escape somewhere , and through heating of the dust , the absorbed flux is re - radiated at far infra - red ( fir ) wavelengths , providing an important test of the models .",
    "the amounts of dust invoked are quite considerable , and combined with the huge quantity of energy that must be radiated , plus the wide redshift distribution of these sources , would imply a substantial contribution to the fir / sub - mm background radiation and source counts .",
    "this motivates our investigation here into the impact of obscured qso models , used initially to explain observations at x - ray energies , at much longer wavelengths .    while this paper was in preparation , almaini , lawrence & boyle ( 1999 )",
    "have published sub - mm count predictions for obscured qsos which give similar results to those described here . however , the conclusions of these authors are based on a simpler model where both the fit of the obscured qsos to the xrb and the obscured qso sub - mm spectrum have to be assumed .",
    "we believe that the sub - mm predictions presented here are more robust since they are based on models which have been shown to give good fits to the x - ray background over its full energy range .",
    "in addition , in our method the absorption of the x - ray and optical spectra to produce the sub - mm spectra leaves no question as to their self - consistency .    in section [ sec : submmobs ] , we describe the latest measurements of the spectrum and intensity of the far infra - red background , and recent observations of the sub - mm source counts .",
    "section [ sec : smmod ] discusses how our obscured agn model can be extended to these longer wavelengths , and describes how the emission from the obscuring dust torus has been modelled .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : smresults ] , and are compared with the observed sub - mm number counts and the intensity of the far infra - red background at these wavelengths .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section [ sec : smdisc ] , and make predictions for the number - redshift relation for future @xmath0 surveys in section [ sec : smfuture ] .",
    "some of these results have already been discussed by ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is extremely difficult to measure the extragalactic far infra - red background ( firb ) , due to the presence of foreground components from interplanetary zodiacal dust emission ( peaking at @xmath7 ) and interstellar dust emission from our galaxy ( peaking at @xmath8 ) .",
    "this zodiacal and galactic contamination must be carefully modelled , and subtracted to leave the extragalactic background .",
    "in addition , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) also contributes at these wavelengths , peaking at @xmath9 , and this must also be accounted for .",
    "once these components have been accurately modelled and removed , it should then be possible to detect any extragalactic firb .",
    "the first detection of the firb was claimed by ( 1996 ) , who used data from _ firas _ on board _ cobe _ , taking advantage of the fir window from @xmath10 , between the peaks of the zodiacal emission and the cmb , and found that the intensity of the extragalactic background has the form :    @xmath11    in the range @xmath12 .",
    "more recent measurements have been made at shorter wavelengths using _ dirbe _ , also on board _ cobe _ ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ; ; ) .    at longer wavelengths ,",
    "there are several surveys currently in progress with the aim of resolving the source populations contributing to the sub - mm background .",
    "these surveys take advantage of the increased sensitivity and resolution now available with the scuba camera on the jcmt .",
    "scuba sub - mm surveys can be divided into two types , the first being pointed observations of blank fields ( 1998 ; ; ) .",
    "the second strategy is to make pointed observations of clusters of galaxies , in order to take advantage of the gravitational amplification due to the lensing mass of the cluster ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) . in this way",
    ", sources can be detected that would be fainter than the flux limit possible without the amplification factor , and in addition , due to the magnification of the source plane , there are fewer problems with source confusion .",
    "the @xmath0 number counts currently published can be fitted with a power - law of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of sources per square degree detected above a flux limit of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these recent measurements of both the spectrum of the far infra - red background , and the sub - mm number counts , now provide strict constraints with which to test theories of galaxy evolution , star - formation history , etc . in the scuba lens survey @xcite sample of sub - mm sources ,",
    "at least 20 per cent were found to show evidence for agn activity @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the implications of the obscured agn hypothesis , by modelling their properties at sub - mm wavelengths . in section [ sec : smresults ] , we predict the number of such sources expected from our models compared with the data described above , and put limits on their contribution to the far infra - red background .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : firbint ]    here we investigate the contribution to the sub - mm source counts and the far infra - red background predicted by our obscured agn model .",
    "we look at the effects of changing certain parameters , such as the covering factor and temperature of the obscuring medium , the luminosity evolution of the agn , and the maximum redshift at which these sources exist . at present , these parameters are not well constrained , particularly at high redshift . however , despite evidence that the space density of qsos declines beyond @xmath16 @xcite , we know that qsos exist at high redshift .",
    "new search techniques are discovering more such objects all the time , for instance the three qsos found recently by the sdss collaboration ( fan 1998 ) , all with redshifts in the range @xmath17 .",
    "as we are using luminosity functions and evolutionary models determined from x - ray selected qsos , these have diverging properties above @xmath18 , and these can therefore be taken to span the range of likely properties . by invoking the most extreme cases",
    ", we are able to put firm upper limits on the obscured agn contribution to both the source counts and firb intensity .      in order to remain consistent with the assumed flat column distribution used in ( 1999 ) , we must also consider the covering factor of the obscuring material , as this affects the intrinsic distribution of column densities . here , we take two examples , first that the obscuring material is isotropic , , with a covering factor @xmath19 , and secondly that a torus covers half the sky as perceived by the nucleus for all sources , , @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that these two values will span the true range of covering factors .",
    "two intrinsic distributions giving rise to a _ perceived _ flat column distribution , as used in the @xmath21 model , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcov ] .",
    "a method for differentiating between these two proposed geometries for the obscuring material in agn , is to determine the fraction which are highly luminous at sub - mm wavelengths . by definition ,",
    "very little dust exists along the line - of sight to broad - line qsos .",
    "therefore , if the absorbing medium is isotropic , the dust content of broad - line qsos must be intrinsically low , with low sub - mm emission .",
    "however , for a toroidal structure in the spirit of the unified model @xcite , broad - line qsos could contain large amounts of dust in a plane perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "this is consistent with the large infra - red bump observed in the @xmath22 to @xmath23 spectrum of a sample of palomar green qsos @xcite .",
    "therefore , if all qsos contain large quantities of dust , they will be strong sub - mm sources .",
    "proposed sub - mm observations of x - ray selected qsos using scuba / jcmt will shed further light on this question in the near future .",
    "we first investigate the predicted source counts for the obscured qso model with a flat distribution of columns , integrated over redshifts @xmath24 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function used is evolved according to the power - law and polynomial models from ( 1994 ) , for both @xmath25 and @xmath26 cosmologies .",
    "the parameters of these models are detailed in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "first , we take as our fiducial model a power - law prescription for the luminosity evolution , and a @xmath25 cosmology , which we denote as pow(0.0 ) .",
    "this model will be used hereafter , unless stated otherwise . in fig .",
    "[ fig : smcounts ] , we show the source counts predicted by this model , compared with the scuba data described in section [ sec : submmobs ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : smcounts ] .",
    "a covering factor of @xmath19 is assumed , for a dust temperature of @xmath27 , integrated over @xmath24 . the contribution from each population of obscured qsos",
    "is shown by a dashed line , with the total source counts denoted by a solid line . the reverse trend to that observed at x - ray energies",
    "is seen here : the populations with the smallest column densities give the lowest sub - mm fluxes , with the high column density populations dominating the sub - mm source counts due to the large dust masses present .",
    "this model predicts @xmath28 per cent of the source counts at @xmath29 , and flattens off at fainter fluxes , but will provide @xmath30 per cent of the firb at @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : smcounts_fcov ] , the predictions for all four boyle models are shown , for covering factors of ( a ) @xmath19 and ( b ) @xmath20 , using the intrinsic column distribution that each covering factor implies .",
    "as expected , the low @xmath31 models give a much larger contribution to the source counts than the @xmath26 models , due to volume effects .",
    "taking the measured value for the @xmath0 firb intensity of @xmath32 from ( 1998 ) , we calculate the fraction of the firb which can be accounted for by our obscured qsos .",
    "low @xmath31 models provide @xmath33 per cent of the firb intensity , compared with @xmath34 per cent for the @xmath26 models , as shown in table [ tab : firbint ] .",
    "the difference in the predicted number counts and background intensity between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cases is due to the increased intrinsic far infra - red luminosity of sources which have an isotropic absorbing medium , as a greater fraction of the nuclear radiation is intercepted .",
    "these intrinsically brighter sources are therefore detected at higher fluxes , increasing the bright - end number counts .",
    "however , at faint fluxes , the predictions are similar for both assumed covering factors , implying that we are observing high redshift objects , which by definition will be the most luminous sources in either case .    for an isotropic covering medium ,",
    "the predicted source counts of obscured agn at @xmath29 account for between 8 and 20 per cent of the total counts , whereas for the anisotropic case , the numbers drop by about a third , since the objects are less luminous .",
    "the contribution to the intensity of the firb is @xmath35 per cent in the @xmath36 case , which is about @xmath37 per cent lower than the @xmath38 per cent predicted for @xmath19 .",
    "if we were to assume that obscured qsos exist out to redshift @xmath41 , then we can make a much larger contribution to the source counts and firb intensity , as shown for @xmath42 and @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig : smredtemp](a ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to envisage a scenario in which large numbers of dusty qsos form at such early epochs @xcite , and therefore this places a useful constraint on the maximum contribution such models can provide .",
    "obscured qsos from @xmath43 could contribute over @xmath44 per cent of the ( 1998 ) measurement of @xmath45 .",
    "there are very few complete sub - mm surveys of agn at low and high redshifts in the literature , with enough data to constrain the dust temperatures in such objects .",
    "the uncertainties involved in making such estimates are high , where assumptions have to be made about the cosmology , the dust masses and the opacities , and in addition , observations at several different wavelengths are required in order to start to put limits on the parameters in the models . treating the dust as isothermal is likely to be an oversimplification , but will be adequate for our purposes , and therefore we estimate that the range @xmath46 should span the most probable temperatures .    for each column density used ,",
    "the fir luminosity is in effect fixed by the known amount of nuclear x - ray and optical luminosity which has been absorbed .",
    "if we increase the assumed dust temperature , the mass of the dust must be decreased in order to keep @xmath47 constant . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the peak of the thermal radiation moves to higher frequencies , thereby reducing the intensity of the source at sub - mm energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : smredtemp](b ) , we show the effect of varying the temperature on the sub - mm counts , where the highest number of sub - mm sources are observed for the model with the lowest dust temperature .",
    "if the dust around most agn is warm , @xmath48 , then the contribution to the @xmath0 firb will be negligible , whereas at @xmath49 , their impact will be more significant .",
    "one further test here for the obscured qso model is to look at the tilted distribution of column densities , which was invoked in order to obtain a better fit to the xrb for high density , @xmath26 , models for the xlf . by skewing the distribution of objects towards higher column densities",
    ", this could have the effect of overpredicting the source counts and background intensity .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : smtilt ] , it can be seen that the source counts predicted with this distribution for a range of models lie well below the observed counts , and flatten off towards fainter fluxes , again primarily due to volume effects . the maximum contribution to @xmath45 from these models",
    "is @xmath50 per cent , for model pow(0.5)t with @xmath42 and @xmath19 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : smnz ] , we plot the number - redshift distributions predicted by our obscured qso models , for an @xmath0 survey to @xmath29 ( _ c.f . _ the @xmath51 confusion limit for jcmt / scuba of @xmath52 ; blain , ivison & smail 1998 ) .",
    "again , we use a dust temperature of @xmath42 , and consider sources out to redshift @xmath53 , and make predictions for both ( a ) @xmath19 and ( b ) @xmath20 . we have taken four models with a flat column distribution of seven populations of obscured agn , and two models using a tilted distribution of six populations , as described in section [ sec : tilt ] ( all for @xmath20 ) . in the @xmath25 cosmology ,",
    "the number of sub - mm sources predicted at redshifts @xmath54 is much higher than for @xmath26 , consistent with the steeper faint - end slope of the logn : logs relation for a low @xmath31 universe .",
    "once more source identifications become available , it will be very straightforward to determine the form of the luminosity evolution , due to the fact that it is as easy to detect a sub - mm source at high redshift as at low redshift , and therefore if large numbers of high redshift obscured qsos exist , they will be found in deep scuba surveys .",
    "the follow - up identification programs for the latest scuba sub - mm surveys are nearing completion , and the source catalogues will soon be published .",
    "we shall therefore be able to compare the numbers of agn detected with the redshift distributions predicted by our models .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath55 per cent of the optical counterparts to sub - mm sources are classified as extremely red objects ( eros ; ) , which are found in images of the scuba error boxes @xcite .",
    "deep radio maps provide more accurate positional information than the scuba maps , assuming that the radio and sub - mm emission is due to the same mechanism , and the ero counterparts are confirmed by the radio data",
    ". it will be very difficult to obtain spectroscopic redshift information about these objects , even with a 10-m class telescope , as they are so faint in the optical , with @xmath56 .",
    "however , near infra - red spectroscopy has been used successfully to obtain a redshift of @xmath57 for the ero hr10 @xcite .",
    "potentially , these could be examples of very highly obscured agn at high redshift , for which in the optical and near infra - red we see the dusty host galaxy ( hence the very red colours ) , and only see evidence for the agn through the sub - mm and radio emission .",
    "future deep surveys with _",
    "axaf _ and _ xmm _ , such as the proposed _",
    "axaf _ and scuba observations of the ssa13 field ( cowie ) , will provide a vital test of these theories , in searching for faint x - ray emission associated with these sources .",
    "however , unlike in the sub - mm regime , the x - ray @xmath58-correction is not working in our favour , and if we assume that these sources are at high redshift , then this is still an extremely ambitious project .",
    "we have shown from the sub - mm number counts predicted by our models that obscured agn provide a small but non - negligible fraction of the intensity of the far infra - red background at @xmath0 , ranging from 1 to 33 per cent .",
    "[ fig : cibghkl ] shows the spectrum predicted from our flat distribution of column densities using a covering factor @xmath59 , a dust temperature @xmath27 , and integrated over redshifts @xmath24 .",
    "it can be seen that all four models predict the same intensity at high frequencies .",
    "this is to be expected , as the emission here is dominated by low redshift objects for which the rest - frame peak of the @xmath60 thermal spectrum is at @xmath61 . since the model parameters have been obtained from fits of the x - ray luminosity function to x - ray selected qsos from _ rosat _ and the _ einstein _ emss , which have relatively low median redshifts of @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , we would expect the predictions to diverge at high redshift and therefore low frequencies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cibredtemp ] , we show the effects of changing the maximum redshift and the dust temperature used in the models . in panel",
    "( a ) , it can be seen that the low redshift sources contribute at higher frequencies around @xmath49 , whereas the high redshift sources account for the largest fraction of the firb intensity at @xmath0 . in panel",
    "( b ) , we show how as the dust temperature is increased , the peak of the predicted firb background moves to higher energies .",
    "the integrated luminosity is fixed by the amount of absorbed nuclear x - ray and optical radiation , and is independent of temperature . since this is a spectral energy distribution diagram , in which equal areas mean equal energies , then the predicted intensities for each model are identical after a shift along the frequency axis .",
    "a dust temperature of @xmath64 would give the maximum contribution to the peak of the observed firb .",
    "the first question to address is what these obscured agn will look like at wavelengths other than the sub - mm .",
    "compared with the majority of the x - ray source population , sub - mm sources have much higher dust masses and therefore much higher column densities .",
    "hence in general , the optical and x - ray nuclear emission will be totally obscured , and the counterparts are likely to appear like relatively `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "these galaxies may perhaps have narrow emission lines in their optical spectra , possibly of high ionization species , or may look very dusty from their optical and infra - red colours .",
    "however , if the obscuring material is not assumed to be isotropic , then a fraction of these highly obscured sources will be orientated such that our line of sight lies within the opening angle of the torus , and therefore the x - ray and optical nuclear flux will escape unattenuated , while simultaneously a large sub - mm flux is detected from the dust in the torus .",
    "the identification of optical counterparts to sub - mm sources has similar problems to those encountered with x - ray data , in that the point - spread function of the telescope is large ( half power beam width @xmath65 at @xmath0 for scuba / jcmt ) , and therefore a number of plausible counterparts can lie in the error box . as sub - mm sources often have associated radio emission , deep radio maps of sub - mm survey fields have been taken ( in preparation ; 1998 ) .",
    "star - formation regions are expected to contain many supernova remnants , known to be strong radio emitters , and even radio - quiet agn are likely to be detected as very faint , @xmath66 sources in extremely deep radio maps .",
    "the high angular resolution of the radio data combined with the fact that radio emission is not affected by the presence of dust , means that optical counterparts to the sub - mm sources can be found in a much less ambiguous manner .",
    "once the counterpart has been found , the mechanism giving rise to the sub - mm emission must then be determined . by assuming that for starburst galaxies , the star - formation rate controls both the radio emission and the thermal sub - mm emission , ( 1999 ) use the radio to sub - mm spectral index as a redshift indicator .",
    "if however , an independent measure of the source redshift can be obtained , then the radio to sub - mm spectral index can be used to infer whether there is any additional contribution to either component due to the presence of an agn .",
    "a radio - loud agn will have proportionally higher radio emission than a starburst galaxy , whereas an obscured radio - quiet agn will have lower radio and higher sub - mm emission .",
    "at present , there is little information available with which to constrain the dust temperature or range of temperatures that should be adopted for our models . here",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath40 remains constant with redshift , but as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smredtemp ] , the temperature affects the predicted source counts significantly .",
    "the advent of larger samples of agn at both low and high redshifts with multi - wavelength fir / sub - mm data will enable any evolution of the dust temperature to be constrained .",
    "having chosen to keep @xmath40 constant with redshift , and a universal opacity law , the only unconstrained parameter defining the luminosity is therefore the dust mass , @xmath67 , ( see eqn [ eqn : pnue ] ) .",
    "therefore , since the fir luminosity is directly related to the x - ray luminosity , which we have modelled to undergo pure luminosity evolution with redshift , then one possible interpretation is that the dust mass also evolves with redshift , with the form @xmath68 .",
    "if the dust mass does not scale with the luminosity , then in order for our models to hold , there must be a balance between dust mass and temperature , with the mass compensating for changes in temperature .",
    "a further consideration is the question of whether the assumption of constant gas to dust ratio at all redshifts is appropriate . for a qso , there exists a radius within which the radiation field is so intense that dust particles will not survive , the so - called dust sublimation radius .",
    "granato , danese & franceschini ( 1997 ) proposed that a significant quantity of gas exists inside the dust sublimation radius , and that a large proportion of the photo - electric absorption occurs within this region .",
    "this would have the effect of reducing the dust masses calculated using the column densities inferred from the observed photo - electric absorption at x - ray energies .",
    "this would in turn , lower the sub - mm fluxes from obscured agn , cutting their contribution to the source counts and the intensity of the fir background .",
    "however , the calculation of the gas to dust ratio for smm02399 - 0136 at redshift @xmath3 by ( 1998 ) , and smm14011 + 0252 at redshift @xmath69 by ( 1999 ) , from measurements of co line emission combined with the sub - mm flux , gives a value similar to that found in nearby galaxies , from which they infer that co emitting sources at high - redshift have already undergone significant chemical evolution .",
    "we have therefore chosen to adopt a constant gas to dust ratio in our models , since at present the available observations are insufficient to constrain any suitable alternatives .",
    "the next decade promises to bring enormous advances in this field , with the advent of innovative instrumentation combined with the light - gathering capacity of 10-m class telescopes , plus the new generation of satellite - bourne detectors . in the near infra - red",
    ", large area surveys will be possible with new wide - field cameras , such as the cambridge infra - red survey instrument ( cirsi ; ) , allowing follow - up observations of the entire survey area for existing and future x - ray surveys , rather than the pointed observations of individual sources used previously . in the far infra - red ,",

    "the survey will have a brighter flux limit than existing deep pencil - beam surveys , and aims for a @xmath74 detection threshold of @xmath75 , from which @xmath76 sources are expected .",

    "clearly , if the obscuring torus is also a site of active star - formation and the sub - mm flux of each component is comparable @xcite , then the number of agn may be somewhat higher than predicted on the basis of the above model .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the obscured qso model for the x - ray background of ( 1999 ) to the sub - millimetre regime , by considering the fate of the x - ray , ultra - violet and optical energy absorbed by the obscuring medium .",
    "this energy goes into heating up the dust in the obscuring material , which then radiates thermally at far infra - red and sub - millimetre wavelengths .",
    "we have modelled the obscuring medium as either isotropic or having a toroidal geometry , which then dictates the intrinsic column density distributions which are consistent with the line - of - sight distributions found from x - ray and optical observations .",
    "since the spectrum in the sub - mm is rising steeply to higher frequencies , the @xmath58-correction obtained is such that our obscured qsos are equally visible for redshifts of @xmath80 .",
    "we therefore use the observed sub - mm source counts at @xmath0 and the spectrum of the far infra - red background to constrain our models , by ensuring that the large quantities of cool dust invoked would not exceed the observed emission .",
    "we have shown that a variety of plausible obscured agn models , which provide good fits to the x - ray background spectrum and the number counts at soft and hard x - ray energies , are consistent with the observed sub - mm source counts and intensity of the firb .",
    "the models predict between 1 and 33 per cent of the firb intensity , and a similar fraction of the number counts , depending on how extreme is the model , but with the more conservative models predicting between 5 and 15 per cent .",
    "this is in good agreement with the fact that the majority of sub - mm sources are identified as starburst galaxies , providing the complementary sources .",
    "in addition , the obscured agn models may be a suitable candidate for the source of the sub - mm emission associated with eros .",
    "finally , we have made predictions of the redshift distribution of sub - mm sources from our models , for both existing and proposed surveys , and described how combined x - ray and sub - mm survey data will be able to determine the extent of the obscured qso contribution to cosmological backgrounds at both high and low energies .",

    "<S> models invoking large populations of obscured agn are known to provide good fits to the spectrum of the x - ray background and the observed soft and hard x - ray number counts . </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence of these models is that significant quantities of dust are required in order to provide the obscuring medium , which will be heated by the nuclear radiation from the agn , and will radiate in the thermal infra - red . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore model the properties of the dust , and predict the contribution of obscured agn to the intensity of the far infra - red background and the sub - mm source counts and redshift distribution , in order to ascertain whether our models are constrained further by the data available at these wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> our conservative models predict a contribution of between 5 and 15 per cent of the far infra - red background intensity , whereas if we use more extreme values for several parameters , this value may reach 33 per cent . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that agn may only form a significant minority of sub - mm sources , in agreement with the results of spectroscopic follow - up . </S>",
    "<S> our models thus show that there is no inconsistency between obscured agn models for the x - ray background and either sub - mm source counts or the intensity of the far infra - red background . </S>",
    "<S> we further propose that obscured agn may explain the sub - mm emission associated with extremely red objects ( eros ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we make predictions for the redshift distribution of agn sources detected in faint sub - mm surveys , which should allow future tests of this obscured agn model .    # 1to 0pt#1 3    [ firstpage ]    diffuse radiation  </S>",
