    "smectic liquid crystals are remarkable layered phases possessing an astonishingly rich variety of structures .",
    "the simplest smectic structure is the smectic a liquid crystal , which is solid - like in the direction perpendicular to the layers and fluid - like within the layers . by other words , the smectic a can be thought as a stack of liquid layers .",
    "smectics c possess nematic - like orientationally ordered layers . in the late seventies , first as a theoretical suggestion @xcite , and later on by experimental observations @xcite some smectic phases have been identified as stacks of layers with hexagonal orientational order , the phases are termed as hexatic smectics or hexatics . the hexatics possess a long - range hexagonal orientational order , however , they have no long - range positional ( translational ) order .",
    "it is worth to note that the hexatic phases are not merely a funny state of a few liquid - crystalline materials .",
    "they appear in many biological systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and even in planetary or astrophysical science as a form of dust plasma @xcite .",
    "investigation of the hexatics is a multidisciplinary area including many fundamental physical problems and involving various questions of chemistry and biology .",
    "however , even after some decades of investigations of the hexatics , a complete description of this liquid crystalline state is still not available , and a number of phenomena remain to be clarified .    in this work",
    "we examine properties of a liquid crystal near the continuous smectic a ",
    "hexatic phase transition , such transition is observed in a variety of materials , see refs .",
    "we investigate the phase transition in spirit of the landau approach in terms of the hexatic orientational order parameter .",
    "the order parameter for the phase transition has to be introduced from symmetry reasoning @xcite .",
    "say , the nematic order parameter is a second order symmetric traceless tensor @xmath4 @xcite . in the nematic phase the average value of @xmath4 is nonzero and therefore the complete rotational symmetry of the isotropic liquid",
    "is reduced to the quadrupole symmetry of the nematic .",
    "an analogous `` nematic - like '' orientational order parameter can be introduced for the smectics @xmath5 .",
    "it is also a second order symmetric traceless tensor , however , its components are within the smectic layers ( i.e. , the order parameter is a @xmath6 tensor unlike the @xmath7 order parameter in nematics ) .",
    "a non - zero average value of the order parameter means reduction of the uniaxial rotational symmetry @xmath8 , characteristic of the smectic layers in the phase a , to the biaxial rotational symmetry @xmath9 in the phase c. by other words , in the smectics c the layers are invariant under rotation around the second order axis whereas in the smectics a the layers are isotropic .",
    "similarly to the smectic a  smectic c phase transition the smectic a ",
    "hexatic phase transition means a reduction of the rotational symmetry of the smectic layers .",
    "however , the symmetry of the smectic layers in the hexatics is @xmath10 instead of @xmath9 in the smectics c. by other words , in the hexatics the layers are invariant under rotations around the axis of the sixth order .",
    "the corresponding order parameter is a six - order symmetric irreducible tensor @xmath11 ( its irreducibility means @xmath12 ) , having components solely within the layers . in the smectic",
    "a phase the average value of the tensor @xmath11 is zero ( the layers are isotropic ) whereas in the hexatic phase its average value becomes non - zero . as a result ,",
    "the smectic layers possess a hexagonal symmetry , i.e. , they are invariant under rotation around the six - order rotation axis .",
    "the tensor @xmath11 has two independent components @xcite .",
    "apart of small fluctuations , almost parallel smectic layers are well - defined .",
    "if we direct the @xmath13-axis perpendicular to the layers , then the two independent components of the tensor are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to deal with the scalar complex field @xmath16 instead of the tensor @xmath11 . at rotation by an angle @xmath17 around the @xmath13-axis the order parameter @xmath18",
    "is transformed as @xmath19 the order parameter @xmath18 is equivalent to the traditional hexatic order parameter introduced in @xcite in terms of the molecular bond orientations ( see also the textbooks @xcite ) .    the next step in constructing our theory is deriving the landau functional for the smectic a ",
    "hexatic phase transition . due to the rotational invariance",
    "the landau functional @xmath20 ( determining an energy excess associated with the order parameter @xmath18 ) contains only even in @xmath21 terms in its expansion .",
    "indeed , just the combinations @xmath22 , @xmath23 etc are invariant under the transformation ( [ rotate ] ) .",
    "therefore the smectic a  hexatic phase transition should be of the second order ( see the textbooks @xcite ) , in accordance with experiment .",
    "since we deal with the two - component order parameter , the phase transition belongs to the same universality class as the superfluid one .",
    "particularly , the heat capacity exponent @xmath24 for the smectic @xmath25 ",
    "hexatic phase transition should be small and negative @xmath26 ( see results of monte carlo simulations and experimental data presented in @xcite ) .",
    "note to the point that the second order @xmath27-expansion @xcite gives a positive but also very small ( near @xmath28 ) value for the exponent @xmath24 . in a dramatic contradiction to this theoretical expectation ,",
    "all known calorimetric data for the smectic a ",
    "hexatic phase transition @xcite show large and positive exponent @xmath29 .",
    "thus one encounters an obvious problem , and the main motivation of this work is to find where is a catch .",
    "we are not the first trying to resolve the contradiction .",
    "some attempts have been performed in order to provide a rational basis for such behavior of the heat capacity .",
    "two different suggestions can be found in literature .",
    "having in mind that the exponent @xmath24 is near @xmath30 , it is tempting to assume that the smectic a  hexatic phase transition occurs in a vicinity of a tricritical point @xcite . then one could expect a sort of crossover behavior , in spirit of of the nematic  smectic a  smectic c tricritical point @xcite .",
    "however , it is hard to believe that all known hexatic liquid - crystalline materials , irrespective to the width of the stability region for the hexatic phase ( ranging from a few to 50 degrees @xcite ) are always near the tricritical point ( and in the continuous phase transition side ) .",
    "another suggestion as far as we aware advocated first in the works @xcite is based on an observation that measured experimentally critical exponents for the hexatic ",
    "smectic @xmath25 phase transition are close to those predicted by the @xmath31-state potts model @xcite ( with @xmath32 or @xmath33 in 2- or 3-dimensional space ) .",
    "however it is not clear at all , how ( and why ) the potts model can be mapped to the physics of the phase transition with the two - component order parameter . in our opinion , this approach is not consistent to be confronted with the entire array of the experimental data .",
    "we propose another way to reconcile the well established phase transition universality conception and the massive of experimental data for the smectic a ",
    "hexatic phase transition .",
    "a recent progress in experimental x - ray scattering techniques @xcite reveals a rather unusual feature of the hexatics .",
    "namely , very narrow peaks are observed in the x - ray scattering data there in the hexatic phase , that is the hexatics are almost `` ready '' to crystallize .",
    "the correlation length @xmath2 of the short - range density fluctuations @xmath34 ( that is the positional order parameter ) , extracted from the x - ray data @xcite for 3(10)obc , is anomalously large , ranging from about @xmath35 in the vicinity of the transition point up to @xmath36 deeply in the hexatic phase .",
    "then because of a relevant coupling between the hexatic and positional order parameters the universal critical behavior , characteristic of the superfluid helium universality class , should be observed only at the condition @xmath37 , where @xmath3 is the correlation length of the hexatic order parameter . in the opposite limit , at @xmath38 ,",
    "the self - interaction of the hexatic order parameter mediated via the translational order parameter fluctuations is effectively non - local and , consequently , some non - standard critical behavior could be expected .",
    "it is the intermediate behavior which results in difficulties when developing theory tool .",
    "we examine just this possibility .    of course , at the condition @xmath39 one has to recover the standard universal behavior .",
    "however , to achieve such relatively large value of the orientational correlation length @xmath40 one has to probe a very narrow vicinity of the phase transition point .",
    "it would be fairly to say that from the available experimental data we are not in the position to estimate how narrow is this region of temperatures with the standard universal behavior .",
    "the textbook wisdom about second order phase transitions @xcite suggests only that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bare ( microscopic ) correlation length , @xmath43 is the second order smectic a ",
    "hexatic transition temperature , and @xmath44 is the critical exponent of the correlation length for the universality class with the two - component order parameter ( in three - dimensional space ) .",
    "assuming @xmath45 we find that @xmath40 achieves the value a few times larger than @xmath46 in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath47 . beyond this region , one has to deal with the intermediate asymptotic behavior caused by the interaction of the hexatic order parameter @xmath18 with the long - correlated translational order parameter fluctuations @xmath34 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is characterized by a scaling behavior , and the main goal of our work is to construct a theoretical scheme for this case and to compare the theoretical predictions with known calorimetric experimental data .",
    "our paper is divided into the following sections . in the foregoing section [ sec : mod ]",
    "we introduce ingredients and basic notions of our model and present its theoretical treatment . in the section [ sec : fluct ]",
    "we examine fluctuation effects in the framework of our model .",
    "the section [ sec : exp ] is devoted to confronting the theoretical results and experimental data .",
    "the section [ sec : con ] summarizes our main findings .",
    "our model is based on involving into consideration two strongly fluctuating fields : the hexatic order parameter @xmath18 and the short - range density modulation @xmath34 ( that plays a role of the order parameter for the crystallization phase transition ) .",
    "we consider a vicinity of the smectic a ",
    "hexatic phase transition where fluctuations of @xmath18 are strong and one would expect the standard critical behavior with universal exponents characteristic of a two - component order parameter .",
    "however , as we noted , the observed behavior of the heat capacity near the smectic a  hexatic phase transition does not follow its universality class .",
    "we explain this unusual behavior by an interaction of the order parameter @xmath18 with fluctuations of the short - range density modulation @xmath34 .",
    "note to the point that the interaction is relevant also in the hexatic phase ( out of the critical region ) , where effects related to the non - zero mean value of the order parameter @xmath18 have to be included into the consideration .",
    "we defer the investigation of the region for a future work .",
    "the cornerstone assumptions of our model are based on the experimental x - ray scattering patterns .",
    "it is well known , that the x - ray scattering is produced by the short - range electron density fluctuations proportional to the mass density fluctuations @xmath34 .",
    "quantitatively , it is determined by the pair correlation function of @xmath34 .",
    "fourier transform of the correlation function is known as the structure factor @xmath48 : @xmath49 for the smectic phases , the structure factor @xmath48 has quasi - bragg peaks at @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the thickness of the smectic layers ) and also maxima at @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is on the order of a characteristic inter - molecular distance in the smectic layers .",
    "a hallmark feature of the hexatics , established experimentally @xcite , is that near the cylinder @xmath52 the structure factor @xmath48 is almost independent of @xmath55 ( more precisely , one should deal with the quasi - momentum and with the first brillouin zone in @xmath13-direction ) . in terms of the positional order parameter @xmath34",
    ", the feature ( weak dependence of the structure factor on @xmath55 ) implies that relevant fluctuations of @xmath56 are strongly confined in the central part of the smectic layers .",
    "the x - ray scattering data provide an information on the temperature dependence of the structure function @xmath57 near the smectic a  hexatic phase transition ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the smectic a phase the pattern is a bright diffuse ring ( cylinder in the three - dimensional reciprocal space ) parallel to the smectic layers with the radius @xmath52 . in the hexatic phase the ring",
    "is split into six spots , according to the rotational six order symmetry axis of the phase .",
    "the angular dependence of the structure function @xmath57 is related to a non - zero average value of the order parameter @xmath18 in the hexatic phase .",
    "each spot is narrow in the radial direction ( along @xmath58 ) and elongated in the angular direction .",
    "the radial behavior of the structure function is characterized by the correlation length @xmath2 .",
    "as we already noted , for 3(10)obc the correlation length @xmath2 is ranging from about @xmath59 in the vicinity of the transition point up to @xmath36 in the hexatic phase .",
    "any case , the correlation length is much larger , than the characteristic molecular size .",
    "we analyze the critical behavior of a liquid crystal near the smectic a  hexatic phase transition where fluctuations of the hexatic order parameter @xmath18 are strong . in this case",
    "the angular dependence of the structure function in the hexatic phase is weak and therefore it will be neglected below .",
    "we are interested in the temperature region where the condition @xmath60 is valid ( as above , @xmath40 is the hexatic order parameter correlation length , that characterizes correlations of the @xmath18 fluctuations ) .",
    "as we explained in introduction , the inequality ( [ corrl ] ) is violated only in a very narrow vicinity of the smectic @xmath25 - hexatic transition temperature where the critical behavior characteristic of the superfluid phase transition has to be restored . beyond the narrow vicinity , that is in the region where the inequality ( [ corrl ] ) holds , a special theoretical analysis of the critical behavior",
    "is needed , that is the subject of our work .",
    "crystallization of a conventional liquid or of a liquid crystal is as a rule a strong first order phase transition .",
    "particularly , its latent heat per molecule is on the order of ( or larger than ) @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath63 is the crystallization temperature ( room temperature in our case ) .",
    "therefore one naturally expects the positional correlation length @xmath2 to be on the order of the molecular scale @xmath54 .",
    "since the experimental data @xcite suggests @xmath64 , we do believe to the weak first order crystallization phase transition for the hexatics , and therefore the weak crystallization theory , see ref .",
    "@xcite , is a natural tool to describe positional fluctuations both , in the hexatic and in the smectic a phases , near the phase transition . within this theory",
    "the characteristic value of the short scale density mass @xmath34 ( positional order parameter ) is much smaller than the average uniform mass density .",
    "then , according to the landau approach , the energy , associated with fluctuations of @xmath34 can be expanded into a series over @xmath34 .",
    "the expansion , known as the landau functional , determines correlation functions of @xmath34 , particularly , the structure factor ( [ structure ] ) .",
    "the landau functional contains some terms of the expansion in @xmath34 , starting from the second order contribution , which can be written as @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{freeweak2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath66 is fourier transform of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 are some coefficients .",
    "the coefficient @xmath68 diminishes as the temperature decreases , as usually in the landau approach , we assume @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the bare crystallization temperature , i.e. , the mean field stability limit of the hexatic state . the coefficient at @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ freeweak2 ] ) has a minimum at @xmath52 .",
    "it corresponds to the maximum of the structure function ( [ structure ] ) at @xmath52 .",
    "there is no dependence on @xmath55 in the expression ( [ freeweak2 ] ) in accordance with the discussed above experimental observations @xcite showing no dependence on @xmath55 of the structure function .",
    "the next relevant term in the landau expansion is of the fourth order over @xmath34 , it can be written as @xmath73 the contribution ( [ freeweak ] ) describes the self - interaction of the short - range density fluctuations .",
    "generally , the factor @xmath74 depends on the wave vectors @xmath75 .",
    "below , for the sake of simplicity ( but keeping an essential physics ) , we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath76 . one more note of caution is in order here .",
    "since the positional order parameter @xmath56 is a scalar quantity , a third order over @xmath56 contribution into the landau functional is not forbidden by the symmetry .",
    "we neglect this third order term in what follows based on the experimentally confirmed large value of the positional correlation length @xmath77 . indeed ,",
    "if the third - order term is not small then the crystallization of the hexatic smectic phase would be a strong first order transition and @xmath2 would be on the order of the molecular size .",
    "the average value of the short - range density modulation @xmath34 is zero in both , smectic a and hexatic , phases . by other words",
    ", there is no long - range positional order in the smectic layers .",
    "let us stress that we are interested in the mass density with the wave vectors near the circle @xmath78 ( besides the standard for all smectics quasi - bragg peaks at @xmath79 , reflecting the density modulation in the direction perpendicular to the layers ) . near the smectic a ",
    "hexatic phase transition ( both , above and below the transition temperature @xmath43 ) the short - range density modulation @xmath34 is a strongly fluctuating quantity , a manifestation of the fact is its large correlation length @xmath2 .",
    "therefore to find , say , the structure function ( [ structure ] ) one has to calculate fluctuation corrections to the bare value determined by the second - order term ( [ freeweak2 ] ) . a theoretical framework of the corresponding analysis can be found in our survey @xcite , here we adopt the method for the smectics near the smectic a  hexatic phase transition .",
    "the interaction between the orientational order parameter and the density fluctuations is described by a crossed term in the landau functional depending on the both fields , @xmath34 and @xmath18 .",
    "the main interaction term in the landau functional can be written as @xmath80 ^ 2 ,   \\label{inter}\\ ] ] where , as above , distortions of the smectic layers are neglected .",
    "note that the transformation law ( [ rotate ] ) explicitly demonstrates rotational invariance of the interaction term ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "the interaction produces , particularly , a hexagonal angular dependence of the density correlations in the hexatic phase , where the mean value of @xmath18 is non - zero .",
    "note , that fixing the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) ( that is equal to unity ) we define the normalization of the orientational order parameter @xmath18 .",
    "to find correlation functions of the order parameters @xmath18 and @xmath34 , one has to take into account a self - interaction of the fields and their coupling .",
    "the self - interaction of the hexatic order parameter @xmath18 leads to a universal scaling behavior characterized by a set of critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the self - interaction of the parameter @xmath34 produces effects that can be examined in the framework of the weak crystallization theory , see ref .",
    "in addition , we should involve into consideration the coupling between the order parameters @xmath18 and @xmath34 that will be examined in the framework of the perturbation theory .",
    "the applicability condition of this approach is weakness of the coupling .",
    "an analysis of the fluctuational effects shows that in the smectic a phase the structure function ( [ structure ] ) can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath69 is the same parameter as in the landau functional ( [ freeweak2 ] ) .",
    "below , the parameter @xmath82 will be termed gap . as it follows from the expression ( [ gap ] ) , the positional ( translational ) correlation length is @xmath83 .",
    "the expression ( [ gap ] ) is correct in the smectic a phase , in the hexatic phase the structure function acquires a hexagonal angular dependence .",
    "however , in a vicinity of the the smectic a  hexatic phase transition , we are interested in this work , the angular dependence is weak and therefore it will be ignored in our analysis .",
    "thus , we use the expression ( [ gap ] ) both , for the smectic a and the hexatic phases .",
    "use of the expression ( [ gap ] ) is justified by the inequality @xmath84 , that is the main applicability condition for our theory .",
    "the gap @xmath82 possesses an essential temperature dependence .",
    "the bare value of the gap is @xmath68 , see eq .",
    "( [ freeweak2 ] ) , the value is renormalized due to self - interaction of the density fluctuations . the main fluctuation contribution to @xmath82 is determined by the so - called one - loop term depicted by the following feynman diagram @xmath85    where the solid line represents the pair correlation function ( [ structure ] ) and the bullet represents @xmath74 , see eq .",
    "( [ freeweak ] ) . adding this fluctuation contribution to the bare value of @xmath82 , that is @xmath68",

    "note that the equation ( [ gap2 ] ) has a solution for both , positive and negative @xmath68 .",
    "that implies that the hexatic phase remains metastable even below the crystallization temperature .",
    "note parenthetically that one has to keep in mind this fact discussing equilibration time in the hexatic smectics .",
    "next , we should take into account the interaction between the orientational order parameter @xmath18 and the position order parameter @xmath34 ( short - range density fluctuations ) , determined by the term ( [ inter ] ) in the landau functional .",
    "the interaction between the orientation and the position order parameters modifies correlation functions of both fluctuating quantities , @xmath18 and @xmath34 .",
    "we examine the effect using the perturbation theory , that is we take into account only first corrections to the correlation functions , related to the interaction ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "the applicability condition of the perturbative approach will be formulated later on in this section .",

    "( [ inter ] ) , the average is zero due to isotropy of the smectic a layers . in the vicinity of the phase transition , we are considering in this paper , the corresponding contribution is also negligible in the hexatic phase .",

    "the wave vector @xmath101 lies near the ring ( cylinder ) @xmath102 whereas the wave vector @xmath31 can be estimated as @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the inequalities @xmath104 and @xmath105 are valid .",
    "the first inequality is related to the condition that @xmath106 , which is valid near the phase transition point , and the second one is equivalent to the condition ( [ corrl ] ) . using the inequalities , one obtains @xmath107 where at the derivation of ( [ delta ] ) we used the expression ( [ gap ] ) .",
    "thus we end up with the equation @xmath108 instead of eq .",

    "now we can formulate the applicability condition of our perturbation approach .",
    "for the purpose we should compare the contribution depicted by the one - loop diagram ( [ feyn3 ] ) with contributions of higher order , determined by many - loop diagrams .",
    "an example of such diagram is illustrated by the figure @xmath115    where a two - loop diagram is presented .",

    "if the inequality ( [ criterion ] ) is not satisfied , we may not restrict ourselves to the one - loop approximation and summation of an infinite series of terms is needed .",

    "the additional contribution to the heat capacity ( [ gap9 ] ) is crucial for our approach .",
    "the main message of our work ( see details in the next section ) is to claim that a sum of two critical contributions to the heat capacity , with the `` small '' exponent @xmath24 and with the `` large '' exponent @xmath121 , enables one to describe quantitatively the known experimental data .",
    "unfortunately in the critical region for the smectic @xmath25 - hexatic phase transition , the x - ray scattering experimental data are very scarce ( only a few experimental points ) .",
    "certainly in such a situation it is useless to fit the theory to estimate at least 3 unknown parameters entering the theory equation for the gap . on the contrary ,",
    "calorimetric data in the critical region are quite informative .",
    "thus in this work we focus on the measurable specific heat behavior and take a pragmatic approach to understand calorimetric features of the smectic @xmath25  hexatic smectic phase transition , and provide relationships between different physical properties .",

    "the effective critical exponent is @xmath123 , and the critical amplitude ratio is @xmath124 .",
    "note that the effective critical exponent @xmath24 depends on the material .",
    "results presented in the work @xcite give the values ranging from @xmath125 to @xmath126 for eight different substances .",
    "such dispersion signals about at least some problems of the approach .",
    "our theory states that the singular part of the heat capacity in the intermediate critical region is a sum of the two terms : the first term with the standard small critical exponent @xmath24 characteristic of the theory for the two - component order parameter universality class and the second term with the exponent @xmath127 , see eq .",
    "( [ gap9 ] ) .",

    "thus to fit the experimental data we utilize the following expression for the heat capacity @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the reduced temperature , and we borrowed the value of the exponent @xmath130 from the standard data for the two - component order parameter in three dimensions presented in @xcite .",

    "physically , the small values of the parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138 indicate ( consistently with our perturbation theory assumptions ) that the coupling term ( [ inter ] ) is small .",

    "one has to take into account fluctuations of both , @xmath18 and @xmath34 .",
    "certain features of the fluctuations in the hexatic phase are different from those in the critical region due to non - zero mean value of the order parameter @xmath18 .",
    "a description of the region is a subject for future investigations",
    ".    one should keep in mind that our scheme implies weakness of the interaction between the orientation and the position degrees of freedom .",
