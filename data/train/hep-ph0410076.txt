    "the formulation of a gauge / string duality @xcite provides a new framework to study confining phenomena .",
    "the duality was originally formulated between type iib string theory propagating in anti de sitter ( ads ) space and a conformal field theory ( cft ) . nowadays several supergravity duals to confining gauge theories are known @xcite .",
    "some of this backgrounds are deformations of the original ads / cft duality .",
    "this is the case of ads blackhole backgrounds dual to a finite temperature field theory .",
    "the spectrum in these backgrounds has been thoroughly studied by brower , mathur and tan@xcite . in the present work we focus on the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) iib supergravity solution @xcite .",
    "this background describes n regular and m fractional d3 branes on a deformed conifold space ; it is conjectured to be dual to a cascading gauge theory with @xmath0 gauge group in the ultraviolet and flows to @xmath1 super - yang mills in the infrared .",
    "the glueball spectrum for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the ks background was obtained in ref . and",
    "the spin 2 glueball mass was recently obtained in ref .. we will review this results and address possible comparisons with lattice results .",
    "in particular , features of the regge trajectory as obtained from this spectrum .",
    "regge theory successfully describes a large quantity of experimental data .",
    "it predicts that composite particles of a given set of quantum numbers , different only in their spin , will lie on a linear trajectory @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin and @xmath6 is the mass squared .",
    "regge theory treats the strong interaction as the exchange of a complete trajectory of particles . with the inclusion of a soft pomeron",
    ", this approach successfully describes the high energy scattering of hadrons .",
    "it is thus interesting to explore regge trajectories from the gauge/ gravity duality .",
    "we show that the ks background predicts a _ linear _ glueball trajectory , @xmath7 . unlike the scenario where",
    "glueball masses are identified with classical solutions of folded strings , here there is no _ a priori _ reason for the regge trajectory to be linear . that it turns out to be",
    "so is remarkable .",
    "the klebanov - strassler background @xcite is a solution to type ii b supergravity equations with non - zero three and five forms and a constant dilaton .",
    "the ks solution is rich in interesting physical phenomena ; exhibits confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , dimensional transmutation , domain walls etc .",
    "we will review some aspects of the ks background necessary for the next sections .",

    "the simplest case to consider is the @xmath2 which is dual to fluctuations of the dilaton field @xmath22 .",
    "after linearizing the equations of motion it is standard procedure to make an expansion in harmonics on the angular part of the transverse space , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is shorthand for @xmath25 coordinates in minkowski space , @xmath26 ir a radial coordinate and @xmath27 denotes all the angular coordinates . collecting the equations for scalar harmonics we find that the dilaton fluctuation decouples from the other fluctuations , the relevant equation is @xmath28 the next step is to expand in plane waves @xmath29 .",
    "using the ten dimensional metric ( [ eq : tendimspace ] ) we get , @xmath30 - ( k^2 \\epsilon^{4/3 } ) \\sinh^2 ( \\tau ) h(\\tau ) f((\\tau ) = 0 .",

    "the spin zero glueball masses are identified with the values of @xmath32 for which eq.([b ] ) has a normalizable solution . solving this eigenvalue problem numerically we get",
    ", @xmath33 where the masses are measured in units of the conifold deformation @xmath34.the same procedure can be applied for the @xmath3 that is identified with a gauge field in the supergravity side . in this case the equations do not decouple and we have to solve a system of equations ( see ref . for details ) .",
    "we obtain , @xmath35,@xmath36 .      finding the spin two",
    "glueball mass is , technically , more challenging since we have to solve for fluctuations of the metric .",
    "consider the metric , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the klebanov - strassler background metric ( eq . [ eq : tendimspace ] ) and @xmath39 denotes fluctuations around this background . in the present case we are interested in infrared phenomena _",
    "i.e. _ in the @xmath16 region . in this region",
    "the angular part of the deformed conifold behaves as an @xmath40 that remains finite -with radius of order @xmath41 at @xmath42 and an @xmath43 which shrinks like @xmath44 .",
    "thus , for small @xmath26 it is appropriate to expand in spherical harmonics on the @xmath40 . after introducing the expansion in harmonics in the iib supergravity equations and keeping in mind that we are interested in fluctuations on the four dimensional space transverse to the deformed conifold",
    "we find that the linearized equation for the fluctuations is@xmath45 where the covariant derivative is with respect to the full ks background ( [ eq : tendimspace ] ) .",
    "expanding in plane waves , @xmath46 a mode of momentum @xmath47 has a mass @xmath48 the spin 2 representation of the @xmath49 symmetry in @xmath50 is a symmetric traceless tensor . choosing a gauge @xmath51 , the fluctuation @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) has five independent components corresponding to the five polarizations of the @xmath54 as expected , all five satisfy the same equation of motion and are thus degenerate . denoting @xmath55",
    "we obtain ( see appendix for details ) from ( [ eq : einsteinlinear ] ) , @xmath56 where , @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 are redefinitions of the background metric @xmath61 such that @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 , they do not contain dimensionfull quantities .",
    "spin two glueball masses are identified with the values of @xmath66 for which there is a solution of ( [ eq : sugraeq ] ) with boundary conditions that will ensure the solution is renormalizable .",
    "a spreviously stated , equations ( [ b ] ) and ( [ eq : sugraeq ] ) are eigenvalue problems .",
    "they can be solved exactly by a variety of numerical methods .",
    "the boundary conditions at infinity are found by demanding normalizability of the states .",
    "we used a `` shooting technique '' to find the eigenvalues .",
    "this method is very accurate for low lying states but requires an initial guess for the eigenvalue .",
    "we used as initial guess the value found from a wkb approximation .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sugraeq ] ) is particulaarly sensitive to accumulation of numerical error due to the combination of hyperbolic functions involved in the coefficients . in order to overcome this difficulty we calculate @xmath67and @xmath68 with 20 digits of precision . with this technique",
    "we find a very stable eigenvalue for @xmath69 we collect the results for the lowest lying @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath70 in table 1 .",
    "the chew - frautschi plot for the glueball trajectory obtained with these values is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is remarkable that the three states lie on a straight line . for large quantum numbers",
    "it is known that glueballs can be identified with spinning folded closed strings . in that approach",
    "a linear regge trajectory is no surprise since it is built in the formalism .",
    "but in the present framework , where we identify masses with eigenvalues of equations of motion , there is no _ a priori _ reason for the eigenvalues to lie on a straight line .",
    "the fact that it is so is remarkable .",
    "the glueball regge trajectory obtained from the ks model is @xmath71 .",
    "we also compare glueball mass ratios with lattice results .",
    "lattice data for @xmath72 is not as abundant as for @xmath73 .",
    "lucini and teper explored the @xmath74 limit of @xmath75 yang - mills theory in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "we present their results in table 2 and show that the agreement with supergravity results obtained from the ks background is within one standard deviation .",
    "it is interesting to include in the comparison lattice results for @xmath76 in @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "note that the trajectory found here using a supergravity approach does not reproduce what is expected for a pomeron trajectory . in our opinion it is too premature to make direct comparisons with experiimantal values for the pomeron regge trajectory .",
    "we consider that understanding regge trajectories from supergravity is an important issue ; the good agreement of mass ratios with lattice results and the fact that the trajectory obtained is linear show that we are making progress in that direction .",
