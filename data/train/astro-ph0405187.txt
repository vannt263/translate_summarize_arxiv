    "for now , there is no evidence pointing to an agn as the source of excitation .",
    "in addition to the nirspec rest - frame optical spectra , we have also analyzed the keck  i / lris rest - frame uv spectra of these galaxies .",

    "a consistency check on the possible agn contribution is provided by the nirspec spectra .",
    "different types of extragalactic emission - line regions can be separated according to the relative values of their emission - line strengths .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite show that agn and liners tend to have higher [ nii]/@xmath4 ratios ( i.e. on the order [ nii]/@xmath143 ) than star - forming galaxies , and that agn have higher [ oiii]/@xmath121 ratios than star - forming galaxies for a given [ nii]/@xmath4 ratio .",
    "while we currently do not have @xmath140-band [ oiii]/@xmath121 spectra for the @xmath2 sample , another way in which agn and star - forming galaxies can be distinguished is according to the [ oi ]  6300/@xmath4 ratio .",

    "the [ nii]/@xmath4 line ratios of the majority of these galaxies indicate that they have already been enriched to at least solar oxygen abundance at a lookback time of @xmath67  gyr .",

    "elliptical galaxies show a similar correlation between metallicity and luminosity , although their metallicities are measured from absorption indices in late - type stars rather than h  ii emission line strengths @xcite .",
    "this correlation can be explained if less luminous ( and less massive ) galaxies have larger gas fractions , either because they have lower star - formation rates per unit mass than more massive galaxies , or because they are younger .",
    "another way of explaining the correlation is through galactic - scale outflows , which could remove a larger fraction of gas and metals from less massive galaxies , which have shallower gravitational potentials , thereby reducing the effective heavy element yield @xcite .    both @xcite and @xcite have shown that @xmath147 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are @xmath148 magnitudes overluminous for their metallicities , when compared with the local metallicity - luminosity relation . despite large uncertainties in lbg metallicities , the upper bound of the abundances allowed by the observed lbg @xmath123 values still falls a factor of three in metallicity below the local metallicity  luminosity relationship . in figure",

    "@xcite estimate that the combination of these two effects may result in an underestimate of a factor of @xmath245 in circular velocity .",
    "of course , the numerical coefficient multiplying @xmath246 depends on the assumed geometry as well , and is unity for a disk geometry ( as opposed to 5 , assumed for the spherical configuration ) .",
    "independent of slit misalignment and disk inclination effects , the emission within the @xmath4 half - light radius may not sample the full range of rotational velocities of the underlying disk . using local starburst galaxies with well - determined rotation curves , @xcite have shown that the widths of optical emission - lines originating in the bright central regions of local starburst galaxies only sample the solid - body part of the rotation curve , and therefore do not reflect the full circular velocity attained on the flat part of the rotation curve at larger radii .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have pointed out this limitation in interpreting the rest - frame optical linewidths of @xmath7 and @xmath24 galaxies in terms of masses .",
    "finally , stellar masses were determined assuming a salpeter imf extending down to @xmath242 , though we have no observational constraints on the low - mass regime of the imf at high redshift .",
    "an imf which turns over below @xmath234 , as assumed by @xcite , would lower the stellar mass estimates by a factor of @xmath163 .",
    "we assumed the standard salpeter form in section  [ sec : masses ] for the purposes of comparing with earlier studies of the stellar mass content of galaxies at low and high redshift @xcite , though a more realistic form for the low - mass end of the imf would significantly reduce the systematic discrepancy between stellar and dynamical masses ( as shown by the values in parentheses in table  [ tab : mcomp ] ) .",
    "most of the above systematic effects would have caused us either to underestimate the dynamical mass , or overestimate the stellar mass .",
    "there is enough uncertainty in our estimates of the low - mass end of the imf , the appropriate radius at which to evaluate @xmath247 , and the geometrical configuration of h  ii regions , that the current discrepancy between stellar and dynamical mass estimates does not represent a crisis .",
    "however , the method of @xcite and @xcite , using simple assumptions to compute dynamical masses , clearly does not account for the amount of stellar mass derived from modeling the colors of these galaxies .",
    "we must understand the nature of these discrepancies before we can trace the evolution of mass in galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "we have presented the rest - frame optical spectra of a sample of seven uv - selected @xmath2 galaxies that also have @xmath153 .",
    "we reach the following principal conclusions :      \\2 .",
    "the calibration of @xcite , which converts [ nii]/@xmath4 ratios into ( o / h ) abundances , indicates that the galaxies in the sample are over - luminous for their metallicities relative to the local metallicity - luminosity relationship .",
    "however , we may have underestimated the ( o / h ) abundances due to the insensitivity of the @xmath125 indicator at super - solar metallicity . in any case ,",
    "given the active star - formation rates inferred from @xmath4 luminosities and population - synthesis modeling , these objects will likely become more metal - rich at later times , and are probably the progenitors of massive spiral and elliptical galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the sample of @xmath2 galaxies presented in @xcite has an average rest - frame optical luminosity @xmath169  mag fainter and average [ nii]/@xmath4 ratio three times smaller , relative to the corresponding values for the current sample , consistent with the existence of a metallicity ",
    "luminosity relationship at @xmath2 .",
    "population - synthesis models of their broad - band rest - uv / optical spectral energy distributions suggest that these galaxies have been forming stars over timescales comparable to a hubble time , contain @xmath225 of stars , and are still actively forming stars .",
    "comparison with surveys such as the k20 and gdds projects indicates a significant overlap between near - infrared- and uv - selected objects . a large fraction of the most massive galaxies at @xmath2 are actively forming stars .    \\5 .",
    "dynamical mass estimates derived from @xmath4 velocity dispersions and galaxy half - light radii are systematically lower than stellar mass estimates deduced from the broad - band seds of the galaxies presented here .",
    "while several plausible effects can be invoked to explain the difference in mass estimates , this discrepancy must be understood if we are to trace the evolution of galaxy masses in the universe .",
    "we would like to thank naveen reddy and matthew hunt for their contributions to the optical imaging and spectroscopic observations that form the backbone of our survey of @xmath2 star - forming galaxies .",
    "we appreciate the assistance of an anonymous referee , whose comments improved the manuscript .",
