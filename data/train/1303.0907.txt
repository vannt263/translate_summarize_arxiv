    "potential couples the channels @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 is some sort of transition energy , or transition momentum . in the presence of continuum states , continuum - continuum coupling ( relevant for breakup channels ) can be included by discretizing the continuum .",
    "this goes by the name of _ continuum discretized coupled - channels _ ( cdcc ) calculations .",
    "there are several variations of cc equations , e.g. , a set of differential equations for the wavefunctions , instead of using basis amplitudes .",
    "coupled channels calculations with a large number of channels in continuum couplings are somewhat challenging : the phases of matrix elements can add destructively or constructively , depending on the system and on the nuclear model .",
    "such suppressions or enhancements are difficult to interpret .",
    "* radiative capture * - for reactions involving light nuclei , only a few channels are of relevance . in this case ,",
    "a real potential is enough for the treatment of fusion .",
    "for example , radiative capture cross sections of the type @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23electric ( magnetic ) l - pole ) transitions can be calculated from @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an em operator , and @xmath26 is a multipole matrix element involving bound ( @xmath27 ) and continuum ( @xmath28 ) wavefunctons . for electric multipole transitions ( @xmath29 ) ,",

    "therefore the radial integration in @xmath48 can be done accurately and the only remaining information from the many - body physics at short - distances is contained in the asymptotic normalization coefficient @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath51 .",

    ", in which the constants @xmath47 carry all the information about the short - distance physics , where the many - body aspects are relevant @xcite .",

    "* transfer reactions * - transfer reactions @xmath66 are effective when a momentum matching exists between the transferred particle and the internal particles in the nucleus .",

    "low energy reactions of astrophysical interest can be extracted directly from breakup reactions @xmath67 by means of the _ trojan horse method _ ( thm ) @xcite . if the fermi momentum of the particle @xmath39 inside @xmath68 compensates for the initial projectile velocity @xmath69 , the low energy reaction @xmath70 is induced at very low ( even vanishing ) relative energy between @xmath71 and @xmath39 .",

    "thus , what matters for the calculation of the matrix element @xmath79 is the asymptotic value of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the anc and @xmath82 is the whittaker function .",
    "this coefficient is the product of the _ spectroscopic factor _ and a normalization constant which depends on the details of the wave function in the interior part of the potential .",
    "thus , @xmath81 is the only unknown factor needed to calculate the direct capture cross section .",
    "these normalization coefficients can be found from : 1 ) analysis of classical nuclear reactions such as elastic scattering [ by extrapolation of the experimental scattering phase shifts to the bound state pole in the energy plane ] , or 2 ) peripheral transfer reactions whose amplitudes contain the same overlap function as the amplitude of the corresponding astrophysical radiative capture cross section .",
    "one of the many advantages of using transfer reaction techniques over direct measurements is to avoid the treatment of the _ electron screening problem _ @xcite .    *",
    "intermediate energy coulomb excitation * - the coulomb excitation cross section is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the reduced transition probability of the projectile nucleus , @xmath85 @xmath86 is the multipolarity of the excitation , and @xmath87 .",
    "the relativistic corrections to the rutherford formula for @xmath88 ( relevant for collisions at @xmath89 mev / nucleon and above ) has been investigated in ref .",
    "it was shown that the scattering angle increases by up to 6% when relativistic corrections are included in nuclear collisions at 100 mev / nucleon .",
    "the effect on the elastic scattering cross section is even more drastic : up to @xmath90 for center - of - mass scattering angles around 0 - 4 degrees .    the orbital integrals @xmath91 ) contain the information about relativistic corrections .",

    "@xcite has shown that at 10 mev / nucleon the relativistic corrections are important only at the level of 1% . at 500 mev / nucleon ,",
    "the correct treatment of the recoil corrections is relevant on the level of 1% .",
    "thus the non - relativistic treatment of coulomb excitation  @xcite can be safely used for energies below about 10 mev / nucleon and the relativistic treatment with a straight - line trajectory  @xcite is adequate above about 500 mev / nucleon .",
    "however at energies around 50 to 100 mev / nucleon , accelerator energies common to most radioactive beam facilities , it is very important to use a correct treatment of _ recoil and relativistic effects _ , both kinematically and dynamically . at these energies",

    "a reliable extraction of useful nuclear properties , like the electromagnetic response ( b(e2)-values , @xmath64-ray angular distribution , etc . ) from coulomb excitation experiments at intermediate energies requires a proper treatment of special relativity @xcite .",
    "the dynamical relativistic effects have often been neglected in the analysis of experiments elsewhere ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is highly non - linear , i.e. a 10% increase in the velocity might lead to a 50% increase ( or decrease ) of certain physical observables .",
    "a general review of the importance of the relativistic dynamical effects in intermediate energy collisions has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    * the coulomb dissociation method * - the coulomb dissociation method is quite simple .",

    "@xmath62b has a small proton separation energy ( @xmath106 kev ) . for such loosely - bound systems it had been shown that multiple - step , or higher - order effects , are important @xcite .",
    "these effects occur by means of continuum - continuum transitions .",
    "detailed studies of dynamic contributions to the breakup were explored in refs .",

    "* knock - out reactions * - the early interest in knockout reactions came from studies of nuclear halo states , for which the narrow momentum distributions of the core fragments in a qualitative way revealed the large spatial extension of the halo wave function .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the longitudinal component of the momentum ( taken along the beam or @xmath107 direction ) gave the most accurate information on the intrinsic properties of the halo and that it was insensitive to details of the collision and the size of the target .",
    "in contrast to this , the transverse distributions of the core are significantly broadened by diffractive effects and by coulomb scattering . for experiments that observe the nucleon produced in elastic breakup , the transverse momentum is entirely dominated by diffractive effects , as illustrated @xcite by the angular distribution of the neutrons from the reaction @xmath108be(@xmath109be,@xmath110be+n)x . in this case , the width of the transverse _ momentum distribution _ reflects essentially the size of the target @xcite .",
