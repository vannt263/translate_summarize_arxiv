    "in the past few years non - local generalizations @xcite of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite have gained much attention since the method allows to study interacting spin and electron systems in momentum space @xcite or molecules within the context of quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "recently the concepts of information theory have reappeared in the study of solid state physics and statistical physics problems @xcite . on the one hand , it has been pointed out @xcite that the von neumann entropy of a finite system of length @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density matrix , diverges logarithmically with the system size if the system is critical and the spectrum is gapless , while it saturates as @xmath0 increases for non - critical , gapped models . on the other hand , in an independent work @xcite",
    ", the von neumann entropy has been used to improve the performance of the momentum space and quantum chemistry versions of the dmrg method .",
    "it has been shown that an optimal ordering of states can be obtained from the distribution of site von neumann entropies of `` lattice sites '' .",
    "quite recently , the study of entanglement has also led to a new procedure using periodic boundary condition @xcite that increases dramatically the performance of real space dmrg ( rs - dmrg ) method and to the development of time - dependent dmrg algorithm @xcite .",
    "an important problem in quantum information theory is quantum data compression @xcite , i.e. , how the dimension of the typical subspace should be chosen to achieve a prescribed fidelity .",
    "the dmrg method is based on a similar reduction of the hilbert space . in the standard dmrg procedure",
    "the dimension , the number of states to be kept , is fixed before the calculation . in the dynamical block state selection ( dbss )",
    "approach @xcite the truncation error is kept fixed and the dimension is allowed to vary .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the prescribed accuracy can be achieved with the least number of block states , if the entropy - optimized ordering is used . in this paper",
    ", we study this problem from the point of view of quantum data compression and show that a simple relationship exists between the von neumann entropy of subsystem blocks and the size of hilbert space of the blocks or alternatively the size of hilbert space that one has to diagonalize in dmrg .",
    "we argue that the accessible information @xcite of mixed - state ensembles can be interpreted in the context of dmrg as the information loss due to the truncation procedure . relying on this we propose a new method to improve the convergence of dmrg .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the properties of dmrg from the point of view of quantum information theory and to use the obtained results to optimize the method .",
    "the setup of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the theoretical background of data compression , accessible information for mixed - state ensembles , and their relation to the dmrg method . in sec .",
    "iii these concepts and quantities are studied by applying the rs - dmrg to the half - filled 1-d hubbard chain using open and periodic boundary conditions and the non - local generalization of dmrg to various molecules . in sec .",
    "iv the obtained results are interpreted as quantum information generation in the dmrg method .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in his landmark work @xcite , shannon has shown how much a message constructed from @xmath0 independent letters @xmath3 , where each letter occurs with a priori probability @xmath4 , can be compressed . in classical information theory messages are classified into so - called typical and atypical sequences .",
    "if for any @xmath5 the sum of the probabilities of all typical sequences lies between @xmath6 and 1 , then for any @xmath7 and for large enough values of @xmath0 the number of typical sequences @xmath8 lies between the bounds @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the shannon entropy , @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , a block code of length @xmath12 bits encodes all typical sequences irrespective of how the atypical sequences are encoded and the probability of error will still be less than @xmath13 . in quantum information theory",
    "the letters are density matrices and one has to distinguish two cases , namely when the density matrices correspond to ensembles of @xmath14 pure states , @xmath15 , or when they are formed from density matrices @xmath16 , with probability @xmath4 .      considering the first case , that is a pure - state ensemble the density matrix of a message consisting of @xmath0 letters is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and the von neumann entropy of the message",
    "is simply related to the entropy of the ensemble , @xmath19 .",
    "the optimal code that compresses the hilbert space of the entire message , @xmath20 to a smaller hilbert space without compromising the fidelity of the message for @xmath21 has been obtained by b.  schumacher @xcite .",
    "analogously to classical information theory @xmath22 is divided into so - called typical ( @xmath23 ) and atypical ( @xmath24 ) subspaces by applying a projection @xmath25 and @xmath26 . if for any @xmath5 almost all weight of the ensemble lies within @xmath27 and @xmath28 while for the atypical subspace @xmath29 , then for any @xmath7 and sufficiently large enough @xmath0 the eigenvalues @xmath30 of @xmath2 belonging to typical eigenstates fall within a narrow range : @xmath31 } < \\omega_n < e^{-n [ s(\\rho)-\\delta]}\\ , .",

    "\\label{eq : qdc02}\\ ] ] this means that the von neumann entropy is the number of qubits of quantum information carried per letter of the message and unless @xmath33 , a compression is always possible . we have to mention that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qdc01])-([eq : qdc02 ] ) have been reformulated in order to be consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : neumann ] ) .",
    "the result is less simple if the letters are chosen from density matrices of mixed states . in this case",
    "only an upper @xcite or lower bound @xcite can be derived for the accessible information .",
    "therefore , if the source of information is constructed from messages represented by @xmath34 states and a priori probability @xmath35 , then the mutual information between the sender s and receiver s measurement is bounded by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath10 is the von neumann entropy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : neumann ] ) . if all signal states @xmath34 are pure states , the upper bound on the accessible information reduces to @xmath38 .",

    "@xcite , @xmath40 where the subentropy @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 if two or more of the eigenvalues are equal , @xmath41 remains finite if one takes the limit @xmath43 .      for lattice models , studied in solid state physics problems , on the other hand ,",
    "the message coded into the wave function of the system has different features .",
    "the site density matrices are in general not independent , thus @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in this paper",
    ", this situation is studied using dmrg .    from the point of view of information theory dmrg",
    "is a numerical tool to select the typical subspace on which the target state ( @xmath46 ) of a hamiltonian of a finite system of length @xmath0 can be represented .",
    "the hilbert space of the system ( called superblock hilbert space ) is defined on a bi - partite system , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the typical hilbert spaces of the left and right blocks , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which themselves are built from subblocks , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with one extra site .",
    "the indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote at the same time the number of sites in the subblocks . the schematic plot of the dmrg configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg ] .",

    "the blocks @xmath63 have dimension @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] .4 cm    although the target state is usually a pure state , the left and right blocks are in a mixed state described by the density matrices @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "analogously one can define the density matrices of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 subblocks , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , as well as that of the intermediate sites , given as @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "it follows from singular value decomposition theorem that for a pure target state and any choice of the length of the left subblock , @xmath54 , the entropy of the left block of length @xmath72 , @xmath73 is identical to that of the right block , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is also related to the mutual information of the blocks , @xmath77 since @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the entropy of the full system , which vanishes if the system is in a pure state .",
    "@xmath80 quantifies the correlation between the two subsystems and vanishes if and only if the two subsystems are completely uncorrelated , i.e. , when @xmath81 . @xmath10 also measures the entanglement @xcite and the amount of quantum information exchange between the blocks @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the finite lattice of length @xmath0 is built up using the infinite lattice method followed by a systematic application of the sweeping procedure of the finite lattice method .",
    "the typical subspaces @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained by selecting that @xmath82 renormalized states out of the @xmath83 block states ( @xmath84 ) , which have the largest eigenvalues , @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the density matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath89 and @xmath90 projection operators are formed from the @xmath82 chosen eigenstates of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . the accuracy of the truncation procedure is given by the so - called truncation error , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 or @xmath93 , depending on the direction of the sweep . therefore , due to the truncation of basis states @xmath13 is always greater than zero .",
    "another main difference between conventional information theory and dmrg is that while in the former case the letter states have an a priori assigned probability density @xcite , in the latter case the probability of a configuration depends on the target state .",
    "therefore , the subset of states which define the code words is determined by the physical properties of the target state . when dmrg is applied to find the typical subspace of a target state , i.e. , the typical code words ,",
    "this subspace is reduced further .",
    "in addition , during the rg procedure the original basis states are also transformed into new renormalized states , thus code words change at each iteration step . in this respect , in dmrg",
    "the information of one block is coded into the basis function of the renormalized blocks rather than into a quantum channel of qubits .    in the standard dmrg procedure",
    "the number of states of the left and right blocks , @xmath82 , is fixed in advance of the calculation . the superblock hilbert space , @xmath94 , on which the target state is determined is not simply @xmath95 , since only states with prescribed quantum numbers have to be considered .",
    "usually @xmath82 is increased systematically during the finite lattice method , thus the accuracy depends on @xmath82 in an uncontrolled way .",
    "in contrast to this in the dbss approach @xcite the truncation error is kept fixed and the number of retained states is varied dynamically , which allows to control the accuracy more precisely .",
    "a threshold value on the minimum number of block states @xmath96 has also been introduced in order to avoid higher lying local minima .",
    "the most general fermionic hamiltonian can be given as @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the matrix elements of the one - particle hamiltonian and @xmath99 stands for the matrix elements of the electron interaction operator .",
    "depending on the structure of @xmath98 and @xmath99 this hamiltonian can describe fermionic models in real space with open or periodic boundary condition , a molecule or a usual fermionic model in momentum space .    a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) is the 1-d hubbard model , @xmath100 in this case the @xmath15 states are @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 . for homogeneous lattice models with periodic boundary condition each lattice site carries the same information ( @xmath105 ) . for @xmath106 , @xmath107 while for @xmath108",
    "the model is equivalent to the spin@xmath109 heisenberg model and only the @xmath102 and @xmath103 states have finite weight , thus @xmath110 . in the numerical work we have used the real space version of dmrg with open ( obc ) and periodic ( pbc ) boundary conditions .",
    "first we have investigated the block entropy in the standard rs - dmrg method when calculating the ground state energy of the half - filled 1-d hubbard model with @xmath111 for a chain with @xmath112 sites , for @xmath113 using a fixed number of block states , namely @xmath114 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : rsdmrg ] we have plotted the block entropy and the logarithm of the dimension of @xmath115 and the hilbert space of the superblock , @xmath116 , respectively , as a function of iteration steps for @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    , and @xmath119 , @xmath120 as a function of iteration steps for the half - filled 1-d hubbard model with @xmath112 for @xmath117 with fixed number of block states ( @xmath118 ) using pbc . for iteration step less than @xmath121 the infinite lattice method has been used . ]",
    "it is clear from the figure that for the _ infinite lattice _",
    "method ( for iteration steps less than 39 ) the block entropy , @xmath10 , increases with the block length . according to vidal _",
    "@xcite a logarithmic divergence is expected if no truncation had been applied during the rg procedure .",
    "deviations occur for two reasons .",
    "first the truncation procedure has been applied from the 5th iteration step .",
    "more importantly , in dmrg the chains are built up systematically , and for chains of length @xmath0 the finite lattice method has to be used after @xmath122 initialization steps . at this point",
    "the entropy of the blocks starts to decrease . in the successive sweeps the entropy reaches its maximum when the sizes of the two blocks become equal",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath10 became almost totally symmetric after the second half sweep already .",
    "since @xmath10 is related to the mutual information of the blocks this result is in agreement with the long known fact that the best accuracy of rs - dmrg is always obtained for the symmetric block configurations . for larger @xmath123 values the entanglement between the blocks is reduced as indicated by the decreasing value of @xmath10 and @xmath105 , while @xmath124 remained almost the same , and the relative error of the calculations improved significantly .",
    "this is the first sign that the entropy , the dimension of the hilbert space and the accuracy is related to each other in dmrg .      this standard procedure , however",
    ", does not allow an a priori control of the accuracy , while this control is possible in the dbss approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latter approach allows to study the relationship between the von neumann entropy of the block and the dimension of the hilbert space of the superblock qualitatively .",
    "therefore , we have repeated the dmrg calculations on the same model using the dbss approach with @xmath125 for various values of the truncation error , namely for @xmath126 . in fig .",

    "it is clearly seen in the figure that due to the truncation of basis states the logarithmic corrections are cut , @xmath10 and @xmath124 is almost constant for a wide range of block lengths .",

    "for @xmath153 close to unity this loss is argued to be equal to the accessible information which is negligible if the probability of the atypical subspace is negligible .",
    "this can be used to optimize the dmrg procedure .",

    "<S> using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method for the 1-d hubbard model , we have shown that a simple relationship exists between the entropy of the left or right block and dimension of the hilbert space of that block as well as of the superblock for any fixed accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the information loss during the rg procedure has been investigated and a more rigorous control of the relative error has been proposed based on kholevo s theory . </S>",
    "<S> our results are also supported by the quantum chemistry version of dmrg applied to various molecules with system lengths up to 60 lattice sites . a sum rule which relates site entropies and </S>",
    "<S> the total information generated by the renormalization procedure has also been given which serves as an alternative test of convergence of the dmrg method .    -8pt </S>"
