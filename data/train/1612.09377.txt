    "absorption lines from ionised material are seen in many high inclination low mass x - ray binary systems , both neutron stars ( ns ) and black holes ( bhb ) .",
    "these are most evident in the deep absorption dips which occur at specific orbital phases due to clumps formed where the accretion stream hits the disc .",
    "however , some absorption lines remain even outside of the dip events .",
    "these are seen mainly as hydrogen and helium - like iron k@xmath0 , indicating very highly ionised material which is distributed fairly uniformly around all azimuths .",
    "these lines can be blue shifted by up to a few thousand km / s , showing clearly that there is an equatorial disc wind in these systems , where the material is strongly photo - ionised by the x - ray illumination from the central source ( see e.g. the reviews by diaz trigo & boirin 2013 ; 2016 and ponti et al 2012 ) .    the most important questions about these winds concerns how they are launched , and their connection to the accretion flow and its jet . both black hole and neutron star binaries show a dramatic spectral transition , from a disc dominated spectrum at high luminosity to a much harder comptonised spectrum at lower luminosities .",
    "this can be explained as the transition between a disc and hot accretion flow ( see e.g. the review by done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "data from grs1915 + 105 was first used to study the change in wind properties with spectral state , with neilson & lee ( 2009 ) showing that the wind disappeared as the source made a transition to the harder spectral state .",
    "they noted that this spectral transition also marks the onset of the compact radio jet , so speculated on the existence of a causal link , with the change in accretion flow properties also changing the magnetic field configuration so that the same magnetically driven outflow is either a wind in the soft , disc dominated state or a jet in the low / hard state .",
    "miller et al ( 2012 ) similarly find that the wind is not present in a hard state of h1743 - 322 , while it is clearly evident in a soft state from the same source .",
    "the systematic survey of existing data by ponti et al ( 2012 ) showed that none of the sources with winds in the high / soft state had significant absorption features in the low / hard state , though there are not many sources , and the most constraining data are from grs1915 + 105 and h1743 - 322 discussed above .",
    "an alternative explanation for the lack of wind features in the low / hard state is that the changing spectral shape at the transition changes the ionisation of the wind ( e.g. diaz trigo et al .",
    "however , other photoionisation calculations show that the difference in wind properties between hard and soft spectral state can not be completely explained by the same wind being present at different ionisation level ( chakravorty et al 2013 ; higginbottom & proga 2015 ) .",
    "this motivated studies of magnetic winds ( chakravorty et al 2016 ) , though it is now clear that both winds and jets can co - exist at high luminosities ( kalemci et al 2016 , homan et al 2016 ) .",
    "however , winds in binary systems need not be magnetically driven .",
    "x - ray irradiation of the outer disk can produce a thermally driven wind / corona .",
    "the x - ray flux from the innermost regions illuminates the upper layers of the outer disk , heating it up to the compton temperature , @xmath1 , which depends only on spectral shape .",
    "the heated upper layer expands on the sound speed @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mean particle mass ( ions and electrons ) , fixed at @xmath4 for solar abundances .",
    "the material is then unbound at radii where this sound speed is larger than the escape speed i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "this gives @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) so the material escapes as a wind ( begelman et al .",
    "1983 , hereafter b83 ) .",
    "a more careful treatment shows that the wind can be launched from @xmath9 as long as the luminosity is high enough to sustain rapid heating ( b83 , woods et al 1996 , hereafter w96 ) .",
    "conversely , at smaller radii / lower luminosity the majority of the material remains bound but forms an extended atmosphere above the disk ( b83 , w96 ; jimenez - garate et al 2002 ) .",
    "current data from the high inclination ns systems show a good qualitative match to the thermal wind predictions , with small disc systems ( short period binaries ) having absorbing material which is static , while outflows are only seen at radii larger than @xmath10 ( diaz trigo & boirin 2013 ; 2016 ) .",
    "many winds in the black hole systems also have a fairly large launch radius , consistent with thermal driving ( e.g. kubota et al 2007 ; diaz trigo & boirin 2016 ) .",
    "however , there is a single observation of dramatic absorption from gro j1655 - 40 at low luminosities which requires that the wind is launched from @xmath11 .",
    "this can not be a thermal wind if the observed luminosity is a good estimate of the intrinsic luminosity ( miller et al 2006 ; luketic et al 2010 ; neilsen & homan 2012 ; higginbottom & proga 2015 ) .",
    "however , even this may be consistent with a thermal driving if the wind is optically thick , causing the source luminosity to be severely underestimated ( done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 ; shidatsu et al 2016 ; neilsen et al 2016 ) .",
    "this single observation , coupled with the observed anti - correlation between wind and jet discussed above , has led to a focus on magnetic winds in the current literature",
    ".    even if there are magnetic winds , thermal winds should also be present ( e.g. neilsen & homan 2012 ) , as we know that the outer disc is illuminated - the observed optical emission is dominated by reprocessed x - ray flux ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "in marked contrast with magnetic winds , thermal winds are rather well understood theoretically in terms of overall mass loss rates .",
    "however , models for thermal winds were developed long before the advent of detectors which could observe them , and they have been mostly sidelined due to the focus on magnetic winds , with only a few recent papers on their properties ( luketic et al 2010 ; higginbottom & proga 2015 ) .    here , we combine analytic and numerical thermal wind models to make quantitative predictions for the mass loss rates for thermal winds , and their observables ( i.e. column density and ionisation state ) .",
    "we couple this to a simple model of how the spectrum changes with luminosity during outbursts to quantitatively explore the effect of the spectral transition .",
    "the thermal wind models roughly predict that the column density of the wind is proportional to the mass accretion rate .",
    "thus the amount of material in the wind should not change much as the source switches from high / soft to low / hard at roughly constant luminosity during the spectral tranistion , though its visibility will be affected by the change in photo - ionising spectrum ( chakravorty et al 2013 ; diaz trigo et al 2014 ; higginbottom & proga 2015 ) .",
    "we compare this to the current observational constraints from h1743 - 322 on the wind in a high / soft state being supressed in a low / hard state ( miller et al 2012 ) .",
    "we find that the thermal wind models are consistent with their data as this high / soft state is probably an order of magnitude higher mass accretion rate than the comparison low / hard state , so should have an order of magnitude stronger wind .",
    "a more stringent test would be to follow the wind evolution during a single transition , rather than to compare the wind seen in low / hard and high / soft spectra at different mass accretion rates separated by years .",
    "we incorporate a simple correction for radiation pressure as the source approaches the eddington limit .",
    "this allows the wind to be launched from smaller radii as it reduces the effective gravity .",
    "we show that this extension predicts a wind with very large column density and rather low ionisation state as @xmath12 .",
    "this means that even the extreme wind of groj1655 - 40 is consistent with a thermal origin , as the wind becomes optically thick , suppressing the observed luminosity , which causes the apparent mismatch with thermal wind models .",
    "grs1915 + 105 is similarly close to eddington , but its more complex spectra require a specialised analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "these are the three main systems on which the magnetic wind models have been built , so we conclude that there is no requirement for magnetic winds in black hole binary systems .",
    "b83 discuss the different physical regimes in which compton heated , thermal winds can form .",
    "we repeat here their analysis for completeness , pulling out only the required terms from their much longer , more detailed analysis .",
    "the central source spectrum contains photons over a broad range of energies , and illuminates the disc at distance @xmath13 with differential photon number rate @xmath14 corresponding to energy flux @xmath15 in ergs  @xmath16  s@xmath17  hz@xmath17 or @xmath18 in ergs  @xmath16  s@xmath17  erg@xmath17 .",
    "electrons in the disc photosphere at this radius have initial temperature @xmath19 .",
    "photons with energies @xmath20 will compton downscattered , losing some energy to the disc , typically @xmath21 .",
    "conversely , those at low energies will be compton upscattered by the hot electrons in the disc , with typical @xmath22 , so they cool the photosphere . combing these gives an approximation for the energy change from both processes as @xmath23 .",
    "this reaches steady state when heating balances cooling , so @xmath24 , defining the compton temperature @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( see e.g. done 2010 ) .",
    "compton cooling is the dominant cooling process only at high temperatures , where the material is completely ionised .",
    "deeper down in the photosphere the heating from irradiation will be lower as the upper layers have already absorbed some of the energy , so the gas temperature , @xmath19 , goes down .",
    "the disc is in hydrostatic equilibrium so the gas pressure , @xmath27 , must be higher to support the weight of the upper layers . thus the density , @xmath28 , must increase downwards by more than the decrease in temperature from the lower irradiation .",
    "higher density means that bremsstrahlung cooling becomes important , which lowers the temperature still further , requiring an even larger increase in density to give the required pressure support for the weight of the upper layers .",
    "eventually the temperature is so low that electrons can start to be bound to ions , making line cooling possible .",
    "this triggers an ionisation instability , as the line cooling lowers the temperature , but this allows more electrons to be bound , making more line transitions and hence more cooling ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) . thus the disc photosphere splits into a hot , high ionisation skin overlying a cool , dense photosphere ( nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "the typical temperature of the skin is the compton temperature @xmath29 , and its typical pressure can be calculated from the pressure ionisation parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the instability is triggered at @xmath31 , giving the gas density @xmath32 ( b83 ; w96 ) .",
    "the mass loss per unit area , @xmath33 is then driven by the material in the skin expanding on the thermal sound speed .",
    "for an isothermal flow , the pressure at the sonic point is a factor of 2 lower than at the base , so this gives @xmath34 .",
    "the total mass loss rate in the wind is then    @xmath35    where the factor of @xmath36 comes from the fact that the disc has two sides . from the discussion above",
    ", @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the disc outer radius , and the total mass loss rate in the wind is directly proportional to the source luminosity",
    ".    however , the wind is only isothermal if it is heated sufficiently quickly .",
    "this depends on the irradiating flux , which drops with increasing radius , so the wind is not heated so efficiently .",
    "the compton heating rate on each electron , @xmath39 , is the incident photon flux , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the mean photon energy , times the mean increase in energy for each photon collision @xmath42 from the compton heating discussion above .",
    "hence @xmath43 . for large luminosities ,",
    "the material is heated impulsively and reaches the compton temperature at the isothermal sonic point which is close to the disc , as assumed above . for lower luminosities , electrons in the gas",
    "are heated steadily , reaching a characteristic energy @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the time taken for the material to reach height @xmath46 .",
    "this equation determines the characteristic temperature , @xmath47 and its corresponding sound speed @xmath48 , but the gas pressure above the ionisation instability is still set by the radiation flux as before so @xmath49 .",
    "this gives @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the luminosity which is just able to heat the gas to @xmath29 as it reaches height @xmath52 so that it is able to escape , at distance @xmath53 .",
    "equivalently , this gives @xmath54    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we extract the simultaneous rxte / chandra data for these observations in order to constrain the continuum shape and luminosity as well as the wind features .",
    "the standard pipeline rxte continuum spectra are shown in fig.[fig : h1743 ] ( obsids p95368 - 01 - 01 - 00 and p80135 - 02 - 01 - 11 for the low / hard and high / soft states , respectively ) , with the inset showing the tgcat coadded heg @xmath55  1 chandra high resolution spectra ( obsids 3803 and 11048 , respectively ) around the iron line bandpass .",
    "it is obvious that as well as the state change and the change in wind absorption features , there is a large change in bolometric luminosity .",
    "the wind should clearly have higher column in the high / soft state simply because the source has higher bolometric luminosity ( see fig.[fig : bhb_over]e and [ fig : bhb_obs]a ) .    integrating the model to get an unabsorbed bolometric flux gives @xmath56  ergs  s@xmath17  @xmath57 for the low / hard state using the nthcomp model with an assumed electron temperature of 100  kev , while the diskbb model for the high / soft state gives @xmath58  ergs  s@xmath17  @xmath57 .",
    "however , the intrinsic luminosity of the high / soft state is probably higher due to projection effects as the disc is seen at high inclination - as evidenced by the fact it has a disc wind ( ponti et al 2012 ) and a strong low frequency qpo ( ingram et al 2016 ) as well as a high temperature disc ( munoz darias et al 2013 ) .",
    "the system parameters are not well known , but dunn et al ( 2010 ) show the hardness - intensity diagram for the outbursts look similar to those of other bhb for a canonical 10mass and 5  kpc distance .",
    "this then gives @xmath59 ( low / hard ) and @xmath60 ( high / soft ) without any projected area correction , or @xmath61 with a cosine dependence assuming @xmath62 ( steiner et al 2012 ) .",
    "this fits rather well with the observed spectrum , as the diskbb temperature is 1.2  kev , i.e. @xmath63 higher than that assumed at the transition at @xmath59 , so the luminosity should be @xmath64 higher , at @xmath65 .",
    "the tail in the high / soft state carries roughly 5% of the total bolometric power , so these two spectra are very comparable to those assumed in the simulations shown in figs.[fig : bhb_over ] and [ fig : bhb_obs ] .",
    "the thermal wind model then predicts that there should be a wind column of @xmath66  @xmath57 in the high / soft state , a factor 5 larger than the predicted column of @xmath67  @xmath57 in the low / hard state .",
    "this is despite the fact that the high energy luminosities are similar in the low / hard and high / soft states .",
    "thermal winds respond to changes in total luminosity and spectral shape and are not just dependent on the high energy photo - ionising flux .",
    "the models predict that the high energy photo - ionisation parameter is lower by a factor 5 in the high / soft state , as there is a stronger wind , but with similar high energy flux . however , this photo - ionisation is not sufficient to fully strip the wind in the low / hard state , so the clear prediction of the thermal wind model is that the absorption features should be @xmath68 bigger in the high / soft state at @xmath69 compared to the brightest low / hard state at @xmath59 , despite them having similar high energy fluxes .",
    "this is easily compatible with the miller et al ( 2012 ) results .",
    "the dotted lines on fig.[fig : bhb_obs ] show the effect of the simple radiation pressure correction ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the column increases dramatically as @xmath70 , becomming optically thick to electron scattering , with a corresponding drop in ionisation state .",
    "our assumed disc dominated spectra at high luminosity are too simple to describe those seen from grs1915 + 105 , so here we concentrate only on the comparison to gro j1655 - 40 , which had a very soft spectrum at the time when it produced the most extreme wind seen from this or any other black hole binary .",
    "this wind has a very large column and low ionisation state ( miller et al 2006 ) , comparable to those predicted here for @xmath70 . however , the observed x - ray luminosity of gro j1655 - 40 in these data is a factor 10 too low to produce such a wind , being only @xmath71 ( miller et al 2006 ; luketic et al 2010 ) .",
    "nonetheless , this could still be a thermal wind , as the true source luminosity will be underestimated when the wind becomes optically thick .",
    "shidatsu et al ( 2016 ) scale the simultaneous optical data to estimate an intrinsic x - ray luminosity @xmath72 , exactly at the point where we estimate that the radiation pressure correction to the thermal wind models should be extremely large .",
    "thus even this most extreme wind consistent with the predictions of the thermal wind models at luminosities close to eddington .",
    "indeed , it would be surprising if this wind were magnetically launched from the inner disc , as the outflow velocity is not large ( miller et al 2006 ) .",
    "we use the analytic models for thermal winds of b83 and w96 , combined with a very simple geometric / kinematic model for the structure of the wind to predict the column density , ionisation and velocity along any line of sight at any luminosity for any spectrum .",
    "we combine this with a very simple model of the spectral evolution with luminosity in bhb , including the major change in compton temperature at the hard - soft spectral transition , as well as the smaller but systematic change in compton temperature with luminosity within each state .",
    "we show that the column density of the wind seen at any luminosity generally increases with increasing mass accretion rate except for a dip just after the transition to the high / soft state , where the much lower compton temperature suppresses the wind .",
    "this predicts that there is more wind material just after the source makes a transition to the low / hard state , in direct contrast to claims that the wind is suppressed in the low / hard state and seen only in the high / soft state . while photo - ionisation also plays a role in the visibility of the wind , we show that this is probably not enough to supress a wind just after the transition to the low / hard state if it was visible in the high / soft state just beforehand .",
    "we critically examine the data on which the claims of wind suppression are based .",
    "grs1915 + 105 ( neilsen & lee 2009 ) is close to eddington , and has complex spectra so the very simple models used here are probably not applicable . instead , h1743 - 322 ( miller et al 2012 ) shows cannonical low / hard and high / soft states , with chandra data clearly showing the wind in the high / soft state is absent in low / hard data with similar high energy luminosity .",
    "however , these two spectra are very different in total luminosity , and this difference is enhanced by the cosine dependence of the disc flux in the high / soft state , while the low / hard state emission is more isotropic .",
    "we estimate that these two spectra differ by an order of magnitude in intrinsic luminosity , so the much stronger wind in the high / soft state is entirely in line with the thermal wind predictions .",
    "this removes any need for suppression of the wind at the transition via magnetic fields , switching from powering the wind in the high / soft state , to powering the jet in the low / hard state ( neilsen & lee 2009 ) .",
    "indeed , such a switch would be very surprising , as the jet is almost certainly launched from the inner disc , while the low outflow velocities seen in the wind shows that it is most likely launched from the outer disc .",
    "radiation pressure should become important on the wind as the source approaches the eddington limit , increasing the mass loss rate as material above the disc is unbound at progressively smaller radii .",
    "we include a simple correction for this and show that this predicts a dramatic increase in column and a similar drop in ionisation state at the highest luminosities .",
    "this compares well to the properties of the exceptional wind seen in gro j1655 - 40 ( miller et al 2006 ) , as the optical depth of the wind will suppress the observed luminosity ( shidatsu et al 2016 ) .",
    "we conclude that there is at present no strong requirement for magnetic winds in bhb , and it is possible that they are not required in the supermassive black holes either ( e.g hagino et al 2015 ; 2016 ) .",
    "known wind launching mechanisms ( thermal , uv line driven and eddington continuum ) should be explored in detail before ruling them out in favour of magnetic winds .",
