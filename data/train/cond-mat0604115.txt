    "recently , the system of interacting atomic gas at low dimensions has attracted considerable interest as it supports a wealth of physics @xcite . for ultracold atoms ,",
    "low dimensions are typically achieved by applying a transverse optical lattice potential @xcite . with a one ( or two )",
    "dimensional deep optical lattice potential , the atoms trapped at different potential wells basically do not interact with each other . for weakly interacting gas",
    ", one can then freeze out the transverse degrees of freedom by assuming the system to be in the lowest level of the trap potential . the atomic gas at each individual potential well thus behaves as an effective two ( or one ) dimensional system .",
    "the condition for achieving effective low - dimensionality in an optical lattice becomes more involved if one has strongly interacting atomic gas .",
    "one of the most exciting directions in current atomic physics is to study this strongly interacting atomic gas , where the effective interaction as measured by the atomic scattering length can be tuned in the full range via a feshbach resonance through control of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the feshbach resonance basically comes from the coupling of atoms in the open collision channel to the molecules in the closed channel .",
    "if this atom - molecule coupling rate becomes larger than the level spacing of the transverse trapping potential , one can not assume a low - dimensional system by freezing the transverse mode in the lowest level @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , intuitively , one may expect that the effective atom - molecule coupling rate always decreases when we make the gas more dilute , and the transverse level spacing increases when we raise the trapping laser intensity .",
    "so , for a sufficiently dilute gas under a strong transverse trap , one can still get the transverse level spacing larger than the atom - molecule coupling rate . with this expectation ,",
    "several recent works have studied properties of low - dimensional strongly interacting gas by ( implicitly ) assuming the transverse mode in the trap ground state @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we want to show that the condition of low dimensionality for strongly interacting atoms under a transverse trap is more subtle than the above simple picture .",
    "we will show that even if the gas becomes very dilute ( in the limiting case , one can just have two atoms with the gas density tending to zero ) , for the ground state of the system , we will still have a significant ( actually , dominant ) fraction of atomic population in the excited transverse levels under a typical wide feshbach resonance .",
    "furthermore , it is very ineffective to reduce the transverse excited fraction by increasing the trapping laser intensity . for realistic atoms such as @xmath0k or @xmath1li ,",
    "even if the trapping potential is increased to some completely impractical level , the transverse excited fraction is not yet negligible .",
    "the basic reason for this unusual phenomena is that in the low - dimensional trap , there is an increased tendency for atoms to pair up spatially also along the untrapped dimension(s ) .",
    "this effect lends itself to an intuitive understanding of the coupling enhancement in the dilute limit .",
    "furthermore , with stronger transverse traps , the atoms in the induced pairs will become more spatially confined also along the untrapped dimension(s ) .",
    "so , although the transverse level spacing increases , the effective atom - molecule coupling is also significantly enhanced . as a net effect ,",
    "the atomic population in the transverse excited levels becomes pretty insensitive to the magnitude of the trapping potential .",
    "although the result here does not preclude the possibility of an effective low - dimensional hamiltonian for strongly interacting atoms under the transverse trap , it indeed shows that in general , one can not neglect the atomic population in the transverse excited levels , and derivation of an effective low - dimensional hamiltonian would be more subtle and tricky than one naively expects @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we give the general formalism for strongly interacting atoms under a transverse trap in the dilute gas limit . in that limit",
    ", the basic picture is captured by two - body physics . for the ground state of the system , the atoms form pairs , and",
    "interaction between the pairs become negligible .",
    "there have been a few works on description of two - body physics of strongly interacting atoms in a trap using the single - channel model @xcite .",
    "recently , there have also been descriptions of the problem with a more realistic two - channel model for the feshbach resonance ( in one - dimensional or three - dimensional traps @xcite ) .",
    "the formalism there , however , neglects the atomic background scattering .",
    "we extend this formalism to include the background scattering , which becomes necessary when the system is outside of the near - resonance region . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our main calculation results for the condition of low - dimensionality under a transverse one - dimensional or two - dimensional traps",
    ". we will also give detailed studies of the atomic population distributions in the transverse levels and in the free dimension(s ) for the @xmath0k and @xmath1li atoms under trapping potentials of various intensities .",
    "to achieve a @xmath2-dimensional ( @xmath3 ) atomic gas , we assume a @xmath4-dimensional optical lattice applied along the transverse direction . the lattice potential barrier is high so that the atomic interaction between different potential wells becomes negligible . with a strong lattice potential ,",
    "the atoms at the bottom of the potential wells basically see a transverse harmonic trap . the atomic gas in each well",
    "can then be modeled as in a @xmath5-dimensional harmonic trap of a characteristic trapping frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the atoms are of mass @xmath7 and possess internal states @xmath8 .",
    "we treat the problem of strongly interacting atoms across a feshbach resonance using the standard two - channel model @xcite .",
    "the short range interaction between closed - channel molecules and open - channel atoms is modeled by a delta function .",
    "the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the atomic field operator , @xmath13 is the molecular field operator , @xmath14 is the bare detuning , @xmath15 is the bare atom - molecule coupling rate , and @xmath16 is the bare background atomic scattering rate .",
    "the bare parameters are related to the physical parameters via the standard renormalization relations @xcite : @xmath17 where the subscript @xmath18 denotes physical parameters , @xmath19 , and the integral is taken in three dimensions with an explicit energy cutoff @xmath20 imposed on two dimensions @xcite . then @xmath21 . the physical parameters @xmath22 are determined from the scattering data as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the difference in magnetic moments between the two channels ) @xcite , where we have assumed that the s - wave scattering length near resonance has the form @xmath27 , with @xmath28 as the background scattering length , @xmath29 as the resonance width , and @xmath30 as the resonance point .",
    "we assume the gas to be sufficiently dilute so that we need consider only two - body physics within each potential well . at a very low temperature , two atoms interact and form bound atom - pairs .",
    "the interaction between the atom pairs is negligible in the limit of a very dilute gas .",
    "the essential physics is then captured by considering the state of two atoms under the above interaction hamiltonian .",
    "for the two - body physics , the center - of - mass degree of freedom is not influenced by the interaction and can be separated under a harmonic potential .",
    "so we can assume the center - of - mass mode is in the ground state of the transverse trap and has zero momentum in the free dimension(s ) .",
    "in this center - of - mass frame , expanding the field operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) in terms of harmonic modes in the trapped dimensions and plane waves in the untrapped dimensions yields @xmath33 where @xmath34 indexes trap eigenmodes @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denotes the wave vector in the untrapped dimensions @xmath38 , @xmath39 . the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent the corresponding atomic and molecular modes , respectively .",
    "as there is only one molecular mode in the center - of - mass frame , we drop the index of @xmath41 .",
    "we have excluded the center - of - mass energy in the hamiltonian ( 4 ) .",
    "the atom relative energy @xmath42 is given ( in the unit of @xmath43 ) by @xmath44 where @xmath45 characterizes the trap length scale .",
    "likewise , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath46 in terms of these modes has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 for convenience , we define dimensionless bare parameters @xmath49 and likewise for dimensionless physical parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "a general two - body state for the atoms and the molecule can be expressed as @xcite @xmath53 the coefficients in this ansatz state ( normalized to unity ) are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation @xmath54 , which yields @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57    thus , eq . determines the eigenenergy @xmath58 , and eqs . and give us the eigenstate as a function of the eigenenergy .",
    "these equations are expressed in terms of the bare parameters , and we need to the use the renormalization relation ( 2 ) to transfer them into the ones with the physical parameters .",
    "one can easily check that under the relation ( 2 ) , @xmath59 for any @xmath58 , and @xmath60 ^{-1}\\equiv \\left ( u_{p}-% \\frac{g_{p}^{2}}{\\nu _ { p}-e}\\right ) ^{-1}=\\left [ u_{b}^{eff}\\left ( e\\right ) % \\right ] ^{-1}-\\bar{u}_{c}^{-1}a_{t}^{3}\\hbar \\omega $ ] .",
    "the divergence in @xmath61 then exactly cancels with the divergence in @xmath62 . as a net result , the above equations ",
    "retain the same form upon renormalization  all the bare parameters are replaced by their physical counterparts , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are replaced by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hurwitz zeta function and @xmath67 is the gamma function .",
    "the above set of equations serve as the basic formalism for determining the state of two atoms in a transverse trap across a feshbach resonance .",
    "if we take the one - dimensional case ( @xmath68 ) and neglect the background scattering ( let @xmath69 ) , the above equation for @xmath58 is reduced to the energy equation in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is derived with a different renormalization method .",
    "in this section , we answer the following basic question : for a dilute gas under a strong transverse trap , can we assume the atoms only populate the lowest transverse level at low temperature so that the system becomes effectively low - dimensional ?",
    "in the extreme limit of a dilute gas , we can consider only two atoms in each potential well ( the density in the free dimension(s ) tends to zero in this case ) .",
    "we will show that even in this extreme limit the excited fraction is typically still significant ( dominant ) for realistic atoms .",
    "if the gas density becomes higher , the excited fraction surely can not decrease .",
    "to answer this question , we use the above formalism for the two - atom state , and calculate the population distribution in the transverse levels for @xmath70k and @xmath1li atoms , which are the relevant species for the current experiments .",
    "we take the scattering parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 for @xmath0k @xcite and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 for @xmath1li @xcite . with a typical trap frequency",
    "@xmath77 @xcite , the physical parameters for the atom - molecule interaction are then given by @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) for @xmath0k ( @xmath82li ) .",
    "to calculate the transverse population distribution in the system ground state , we first determine the binding energy between the atoms using eq . .",
    "the binding energy @xmath83 ( in the unit of @xmath84 ) , where the latter term @xmath85 is the energy for two free atoms ( excluding the contribution from the center - of - mass mode ) . as",
    "the binding energy is of interest by itself , we show @xmath86 as a function of the magnetic field detuning @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : evsb_k ] and [ fig : evsb_l ] with @xmath88 for @xmath0k and @xmath1li , respectively .    for @xmath0k , the binding energy saturates on the deep bec side .",
    "this effect comes from the positive background scattering length of @xmath0k , and is related to the weakly bound state in the open collision channel .",
    "the detailed discussion of the background scattering effects can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "so , outside of the near resonance region , the result here is quite different from the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the binding energy is calculated for the @xmath68 case without the background scattering contribution . from fig .",
    "[ fig : evsb ] , one can also see that with a transverse trap , the binding energy @xmath89 is always positive , and only tends to zero when one goes to the deep bcs limit @xcite ( or when @xmath90 for @xmath0k , where the scattering length goes to zero ) .",
    "this is distinct from the case without traps , where @xmath91 for @xmath92 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gspop ] , we show the population distribution in transverse levels for @xmath0k and @xmath1li in two or one dimensional traps as a function of the magnetic field detuning .",
    "the population fraction in the transverse modes @xmath93  is defined as @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_mnk ] , we show a more complete picture of the population distribution at a fixed detuning on the bec side for atoms in a one dimensional trap .",
    "from the figures , one can see that in general many transverse modes are populated . for a fixed mode ,",
    "the population still goes down as the energy of the mode goes up , but there are so many excited transverse modes that the total population fraction in the excited levels actually dominates in typical configurations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : e+exfrac ] , we draw the overall fraction populating the transverse excited levels , which is defined as @xmath95 . this fraction needs to satisfy @xmath96 for the assumption that the atoms only populate the lowest transverse level . from the figure",
    ", one can see that this condition is in general not satisfied for @xmath0k and @xmath1li , except in the deep bcs limit with the binding energy @xmath97 .    for the case of @xmath1li , if one goes to the very deep bec limit with the closed channel population ( the bare molecule fraction ) @xmath98 , the condition @xmath96 is also automatically satisfied . for @xmath0k , because of its positive background scattering length , the bare molecule fraction @xmath99 remains small even if one goes to the deep bec limit @xcite .",
    "so the excited fraction @xmath100 continuously goes up as one increases the negative detuning . from this calculation , it is clear that for the entire region near resonance , which is of particular experimental interest , one can not neglect the transverse excited fractions for any atoms with a wide feshbach resonance",
    ".    the condition @xmath96  can only be satisfied in the near resonance region for the narrow feshbach resonance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exfracvsg ] , we show the excited fractions for various atom - molecule coupling rates .",
    "the background scattering length still takes the positive or negative values corresponding to @xmath0k or @xmath1li atoms , but we vary the coupling rate @xmath50 ( so the resonance width @xmath29 changes ) .",
    "one can see that the condition @xmath96 is satisfied in the whole region only when @xmath101 .",
    "as @xmath102 , the condition @xmath101  requires a very narrow resonance with the resonance width @xmath103 . on the other hand , one can also see from the figure that to satisfy @xmath96 , the background interaction @xmath104 can be somewhat larger than @xmath105 , but it can not be arbitrarily larger .",
    "we have tested ( not shown in the figure ) that the condition @xmath96 breaks down when @xmath51 is on the order of a few tens .",
    "the above calculations are done with a fixed trap frequency @xmath106 , as it is typical for current experiments @xcite .",
    "one may expect that if the trap frequency further increases , it will become much easier to suppress the transverse excited fraction and to satisfy the condition @xmath107 . to test whether this is true ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : exfrac ] the transverse excited fraction versus the magnetic field detuning for various magnitudes of the trap frequency .",
    "one can see that even if the trap frequency increases by several orders of magnitudes , the transverse excited fraction @xmath100 does not change much and remains significant . to understand this puzzling effect",
    ", we note that although the transverse level spacing increases a lot , the effective atom - molecule coupling rate also increases .",
    "one can not assume a constant atom - molecule coupling rate as an enhanced trapping in the transverse direction will suppress the pair size in all directions including the free dimensions ( see the next paragraph ) .",
    "the effective atom - molecule coupling rate increases significantly when the pair size shrinks . as a net effect ,",
    "the ratio between the atom - molecule coupling and the transverse level spacing is only a slowly - varying function of the trap frequency .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath50 , which measures the effective atom - molecule coupling strength in the unit of the trap frequency , actually characterizes this ratio . from its expression",
    ", one can verify that @xmath50 goes as @xmath108 .",
    "so , the effective ratio @xmath50 only drops by a factor of @xmath109 ( it will still be larger than @xmath105 for @xmath1li and @xmath0k ) even if the trap frequency increases by four orders of magnitudes from its current value ( which is almost impossible ) .",
    "this explains the relative insensitivity of the excited fraction @xmath100 to the trap frequency .",
    "we can also conclude here that for any reasonable trap strength one can imagine , it is impossible to neglect the transverse excited fractions for realistic atoms such as @xmath110li and @xmath0k with a wide feshbach resonance .    with an increased transverse trapping ,",
    "it is easy to understand that the pair size along that direction will be suppressed .",
    "however , it is not so obvious that the pair size along the free dimension(s ) , where there is no trap , will correspondingly shrink .",
    "the latter actually comes from the interaction effect . under strong interaction ,",
    "the pair size can not change only along one direction . to see the pair size shrinking along the untrapped directions",
    ", we can take the fourier transform of the pair wavefunction @xmath111 with respect to the momentum @xmath37 in the free dimension(s ) .",
    "this fourier transform , denoted as @xmath112 , yields the real - space wavefunction , which is the probability amplitude for an atom pair in transverse modes @xmath34 and @xmath113 to be spaced a distance @xmath114 apart in free dimension(s ) .    from eq .",
    ", @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a modified bessel function of the second kind , and @xmath118 which characterizes the pair size in the free dimension(s ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath119 on the trapping frequency is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : xi ] for different transverse modes @xmath120 on the bec side .",
    "note that under typical configurations , the atom population is broadly distributed over the transverse modes ( as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_mnk ] ) , so the exact pair size in the free dimension(s ) should come from the average of @xmath119  over different @xmath120 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] , one can see that for typical values of @xmath121 , the pair size significantly shrinks with increase of the trap frequency , so its average will follow the same trend .",
    "as one moves towards the bcs side of resonance , the trend only becomes more dramatic .",
    "this provides a physical interpretation of the coupling enhancement : the transverse trap raises the minimum energy of the atoms relative to the molecules .",
    "thus , the smaller atom pairs which have stronger mixture with the molecules become more energetically favorable .",
    "the net result is a sort of induced pair - wise confinement along the free dimension(s ) , and this increased local density causes the effective coupling to increase .",
    "in summary , we have shown that for experimentally relevant cases , atoms trapped along one or two dimensions can not be considered to be in the transverse ground level except when well out of the bcs - bec crossover region . in the crossover region and for the ground state of the system , a significant fraction of atomic population resides in the excited transverse levels , even if the gas is very dilute .",
    "furthermore , one can not effectively suppress the transverse excited fraction by raising the trap intensity .",
    "even with an extremely strong trap far beyond the current experimental technology , the transverse excited fraction is not negligible yet for realistic atoms such as @xmath1li and @xmath0k across a wide feshbach resonance .",
    "the conclusion here is that in the experimentally interesting region , one can not describe strongly interacting atoms under a transverse trap as a low - dimensional system by assuming a fixed transverse mode .",
    "although this result does not exclude an _ effective _ low - dimensional description of this strongly interacting system , it indeed shows that the effective description will become much more subtle , and such a description needs to take into account the broad population distribution of the atoms in all the transverse modes .",
    "the derivation of such an effective description will be a topic for further investigation @xcite .",
