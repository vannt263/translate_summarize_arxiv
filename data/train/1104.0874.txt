    "atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis of x - ray and neutron powder diffraction data is becoming prominent in structure analysis of complex materials due to an increasing interest in studying structure from nanoscale structural order .",
    "@xcite dedicated experimental facilities are appearing for pdf studies  @xcite as well as specialized software .  @xcite",
    "as more people in the structure - characterization community adopt the pdf method , it is important to reevaluate and strengthen our analysis techniques . to this end , we have investigated the information content in the pdf data allowing us to determine optimal grid spacings to use when calculating pdfs . the sampling grid for pdfs is typically chosen in an _ ad - hoc _ way , for example , to give a visually smooth pdf .",
    "the information content in the pdf does not increase for grid intervals above a critical value . if the data are oversampled , not only is no new information introduced , the points in the pdf are not statistically independent ,  @xcite which leads to improper estimates of uncertainties in refinement parameters and slowing down the refinement .",
    "@xcite    we have systematically studied the optimal pdf sampling interval for pdf data and demonstrate that it is consistent with the value predicted by the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem .  @xcite this gives the minimum amount of information we need to completely specify a pdf from a given @xmath0 .",
    "when this optimal sampling is enforced , we see significant speed - up in our pdf refinements accompanied by a small increase in estimated uncertainties due to the reduction of statistical correlations among the pdf points .",
    "when the data are made sparser than the optimal sampling interval the refinement results rapidly become unreliable due to aliasing .",
    "the pdf method is a total scattering technique for determining local order in nanostructured materials .",
    "@xcite the technique does not require periodicity , so it is well suited for studying nanoscale features in a variety of materials .",
    "@xcite the experimental pdf , denoted @xmath1 , is the truncated fourier transform of the total scattering structure function , @xmath2 $ ] :  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the scattering momentum .",
    "the structure function , @xmath5 , is extracted from the bragg and diffuse components of x - ray , neutron or electron powder diffraction intensity . for elastic scattering , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the scattering wavelength and @xmath8 is the scattering angle . in practice ,",
    "values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined by the experimental setup and @xmath10 is often reduced below the experimental maximum to eliminate noisy data from the pdf since the signal to noise ratio becomes unfavorable in the high-@xmath4 region .",
    "the pdf gives the scaled probability of finding two atoms in a material a distance @xmath11 apart and is related to the density of atom pairs in the material .",

    "[ eq : grfromrhor ] to fit the pdf generated from a structure model to a pdf determined from experiment . for this purpose ,",
    "the delta functions in eqs .",
    "[ eq : grfromrhor ] are gaussian - broadened and the equation is modified to account for experimental effects .",
    "pdf modeling is performed by adjusting the parameters of the structure model , such as the lattice constants , atom positions and anisotropic atomic displacement parameters , to maximize the agreement between the theoretical and an experimental pdf .",
    "this procedure is implemented in pdfgui ,  @xcite which is the program used in this study .",
    "pdfgui  uses the levenberg - marquardt algorithm  @xcite to locally optimize the model structure .",
    "the algorithm also provides estimates of uncertainties on those parameters upon convergence , though strictly the estimates are only accurate if the data are independent and the statistical errors are gaussian distributed and properly determined .",
    "the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem specifies an upper bound on the sampling interval of a discretized signal in the time domain such that the sample contains all the available frequency information from the signal .",
    "this upper bound is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angular frequency bandwidth of the signal .  @xcite the quantity @xmath20 is commonly referred to as the _ nyquist interval_. a continuous or discrete signal sampled on a grid finer than the nyquist interval can be , in principle , perfectly reconstructed via interpolation , since the sampling does not compromise the information content of the signal .    in relation to the pdf",
    ", the angular frequency domain is @xmath4-space and we are interested in sampling in @xmath11-space , the analogue of the time domain .",
    "the frequency information is specified by @xmath0 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : ftofsqtogr ] ) , which has bandwidth @xmath10 .",
    "is an odd function ( see eq .  15 in  @xcite ) , a fact we use when transforming @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( eq .  [ eq : ftofsqtogr ] ) .",

    "@xmath23does not enter into this since we enforce @xmath24 during modeling .",
    "@xcite ] this gives a nyquist interval of @xmath25 the sampling theorem states that the pdf can be sampled on any grid with intervals shorter than this without losing any information from @xmath0 .",
    "whittaker  @xcite and shannon  @xcite describe an interpolation formula for reconstructing a signal from samples taken on a grid with interval , @xmath26 , less than the nyquist interval . in terms of the pdf , the reconstruction formula is @xmath27 where @xmath28 iterates over the points of the sample .",
    "later we will demonstrate the benefits of modeling the pdf on an optimally sampled grid .",
    "this formula allows us to interpolate a model pdf onto a denser grid , e.g.  for convenient visual inspection . in practice",
    ", the sampled data must extend beyond the desired range to avoid reconstruction errors in the high-@xmath11 region .",
    "sampling @xmath1 at or coarser than the nyquist interval results in _",
    "aliasing_. this term refers to how , in undersampled data , high @xmath4 information in @xmath0 can masquerade as intensity at lower @xmath4 .",
    "this is demonstrated for the pdf by considering its fourier series over @xmath29 .",
    "we choose this range because it lets us consider the sine - fourier series ( @xmath1 is odd ) and because the pdf over this range contains the same information as the pdf over @xmath30 .",
    "now , @xmath31 where @xmath32 . since @xmath1 contains no frequency components greater than @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and thus @xmath35 .",
    "consider the @xmath36 term of the series sampled on the interval @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are chosen such that @xmath40 .",
    "for the @xmath41 sample , the contribution to the fourier series is @xmath42 .",
    "given the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath38 , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we can represent the argument as @xmath45 , so that the @xmath46 frequency component of the sample looks like @xmath47 for all @xmath28 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath1 from @xmath0 at @xmath48 therefore appears in @xmath1 as if it came from @xmath49 in @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , in @xmath0 the signal above @xmath38 gets `` folded '' back to lower @xmath4 and overlaps with the signal in the range @xmath50 . this explains how information in @xmath0 is progressively lost in @xmath1 if @xmath1 is calculated on grids that are too coarse .",
    "the more undersampled the data , the greater the @xmath4-range that is folded back and the greater the loss of information in @xmath1 due to overlapping signals from different @xmath4-values .",
    "the effect is illustrated in fig .",

    "this sampling interval is larger than the nyquist interval ( @xmath54 ) and corresponds to @xmath55 .",

    "we note that the case where the data are sampled precisely on a grid with the nyquist interval , @xmath57 , then @xmath58 and there is no folding .",
    "however , there is still loss of information since @xmath59 , and so the @xmath46 fourier amplitude , @xmath60 , can take on any value .",
    "this is why a strict inequality between the sampling interval and the nyquist interval is required to avoid aliasing : @xmath61 .",
    "aliasing implies that the sampled signal does not uniquely identify its source .",
    "since some frequency components alias others , the pdf could represent the aliased @xmath0 just as well as the unaliased one . when back - fourier transforming a sparsely sampled @xmath1 into @xmath4 space , the aliased @xmath0 will result .",
    "the sampling theorem states that aliasing does not occur when sampling at an interval smaller than the nyquist interval .",
    "the sampling theorem determines the number of data points required to reconstruct a pdf signal from samples , which is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the extent of the pdf in @xmath11-space . what is more relevant to pdf modeling is the amount of structural information in the pdf .",
    "@xmath64 is an upper bound on this since we can not extract more independent observations of the structure than raw information from the signal",
    ". given perfect data and the proper model , one can meaningfully extract @xmath64 structural parameters from a pdf signal .",
    "factors such as noise and peak overlap can obscure the structural information in the pdf and therefore determine whether @xmath64 is a good estimate of the amount of structural information in the pdf . for example , consider a situation where the pdf contains a single peak , but has a very large @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", a complete crystal model can not be obtained from fitting this single peak , no matter how large @xmath64 is . in another extreme case ,",
    "imagine that the majority of pdf peaks have a single point or no points due to a small @xmath33 .",
    "in this situation the anisotropic displacement parameters can not be determined with certainty .    in practice , the amount of structural information in the pdf can not be precisely known . to perform a reliable refinement ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio must be favorable ,  @xcite the pdf peaks must be apparent , and the fit range must be such that the structural features one is seeking to model are accessible .",
    "in addition to this , we recommend using rietveld refinement guidelines when refining the pdf , which advise that the ratio of independent observations to the number of refinement parameters should be around three to five , preferring the latter .  @xcite",
    "powder diffraction data were collected from nickel and lamno@xmath65 ( lmo ) samples .",
    "the nickel data were collected using the rapid acquisition pair distribution function ( rapdf ) technique  @xcite with synchrotron x - rays on beamline 6-id - d at the advanced photon source at argonne national laboratory .",
    "the sample was purchased from alfa aesar .",

    "@xcite corrections for environmental scattering , incoherent and multiple scattering , polarization and absorption were performed according to the standard procedures  @xcite using pdfgetx2  @xcite to obtain the pdf with @xmath51 .",

    "the lmo data were collected using time - of - flight neutron diffraction at the npdf instrument at the los alamos neutron scattering center at los alamos national laboratory . the lmo sample preparation and data collection",
    "have been described in detail elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the lmo pdfs were produced with pdfgetn  @xcite using @xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath69 .    in each case , experimental pdfs were generated with @xmath70 using @xmath71 .",
    "pdf data on sparser grids were created by removing points from this pdf in order to get the desired sampling interval .",
    "pruning the data in this way is equivalent to recalculating the pdf from @xmath0 on the sparser grid .",
    "we produced 31 data - sets with varying @xmath72against which models were refined .",
    "we took as a reference data - set the pdf generated on the default grid of @xmath71 and structural models were refined to the data .",

    "the accuracy of the refined parameters becomes unacceptable when @xmath73 exceeds the statistical uncertainty on the difference , @xmath75 .",
    "this is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the estimated uncertainties on parameter @xmath74 taken from the refinement for the data - set sampled at interval @xmath26 and the reference data - set , respectively . to determine if a refined parameter extracted from a sparse data set is accurate , we define a parameter quality factor , @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath80 is less than or equal to one , the parameter value refined from the data - set sampled at interval @xmath26 is within the expected uncertainty of the best estimate and is considered accurate . if @xmath81 is greater than one , the change in the parameter s value is greater than the expected uncertainty , and the result is considered unreliable .    the parameter quality measure , @xmath81 , is biased due to a couple of assumptions .",
    "first , by comparing all results with the refinement of the undiluted data we assume that this refinement gives the best estimate for each parameter . the validity of this assumption is dependent on the systematic bias of the refinement results due to the quality of the data and the suitability of the refinement model . since",
    "this bias is present in the diluted data as well , its effects should be negligible .",
    "second , we assume that the uncertainty value derived from the refinement results is accurate . we discuss later that the uncertainty values derived from refinements of oversampled data - sets are too small .",
    "this inflates the estimated quality factor when the data are oversampled , but does not invalidate the accompanying results .",
    "the refinements from unaltered and sampled data - sets were performed identically over a range from @xmath82 to @xmath83 using the program pdfgui .",
    "@xcite for the nickel data , the lattice parameter , isotropic atomic displacement parameter ( adp ) , dynamic correlation factor , scale factor and resolution factor were varied in the refinements . in the lmo",

    "this is not observed .",
    "the instability is not caused solely by information loss , but by information corruption due to aliasing .",
    "aliasing has two effects on a pdf signal , as described in section [ sec : aliasing ] .",
    "foremost , aliasing lowers the effective maximum @xmath4-value in @xmath0 from @xmath33to @xmath110 .",
    "this creates the obvious effect of lower resolution in the pdf , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : sparseni ] and [ fig : sparselmo ] . in extreme cases",
    ", this will lead to poorly defined peaks in the pdf .",
    "less obviously , sampling on a grid coarser than the nyquist interval allows for the possibility that the pdf has originated from a different , aliased , @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aliasing ] . when calculating the model pdf , we enforce @xmath111 . when there is aliasing the structure function resulting from @xmath1 has @xmath112 , and extra intensity below @xmath113 .",
    "thus , aliasing makes it possible to find a different set of refinement parameters that describes the sampled pdf .",
    "this is true regardless of the optimization algorithm .",
    "the estimated uncertainties on the fitting parameters for @xmath72 in the region of stable refinements are dependent on the sampling interval .",
    "we see from tables [ table : niresults ] and [ table : lmoresults ] that the uncertainties on the parameters increase when estimated from the data sampled near the nyquist interval compared to the reference data .",
    "the sampling theorem gives the number of data points necessary to fully represent the pdf .",
    "any data sampled on a grid finer than the nyquist interval are necessarily redundant .",
    "if a set of fitting parameters reproduces a particular set of points well on a optimal grid , those parameters will also reproduce the associated redundant points well . by not taking into account the correlations between data points ,  @xcite as in this study , this results in under - estimated uncertainty",
    "values on parameters .",
    "refining optimally sampled data reduces these correlations while retaining all the structural information available in the data and gives a more reliable estimate of uncertainties .    a fortunate side - effect of refining optimally sampled data is a decreased refinement time . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramresults ] is a plot of refinement times for some chosen sampling intervals .",
    "the trend in the plot shows that refinement time is proportional to the inverse of @xmath72(shown as the broad solid line ) , or directly proportional to the number of data points , with a constant offset .",
    "this trend reflects the fact that the calculation of the pdf grows linearly with the number of sample points .",
    "carrying out refinements on optimally sampled data gives a significant speed increase compared to the reference data ; in this case the speed increases by more than a factor of seven .",
    "these observations indicate that pdf refinements should be performed on the sparsest grid possible with sampling interval less than the nyquist interval .",
    "to produce an esthetically pleasing presentation of the pdf , one can interpolate onto a finer grid using the whittaker - shannon interpolation formula ( eq .  [ eq : whittpdf ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this research was to demonstrate the consequences of the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem as it applies to the pdf .",
    "we show that the quality of refined parameters diverges when sampling the pdf at intervals larger than the nyquist interval , which is the result of aliasing .",
    "furthermore , we show that the estimated uncertainties of refined parameters are more reliable when the pdf is optimally sampled .",
    "statistically reliable uncertainties on refined parameters can be obtained by taking into account the correlations between all the points in @xmath1 ,  @xcite but this comes at the computational expense of inverting a large error matrix . by optimally sampling the pdf ,",
    "the correlations among points in the pdf are minimized while preserving all the available structural information .",
    "this gives improved uncertainty estimates without costly computation , and may expedite refinements when the pdf can be computed over fewer points .",
    "the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem gives an upper bound on the amount of structural information contained in an experimental pdf .",
    "this determines the @xmath4- and @xmath11-extent that are required for a model refinement to be overconstrained .",
    "oversampling the pdf does not add more information to a refinement , and therefore provides no benefit other than an esthetically pleasing visualization .",
    "this result emphasizes the importance of collecting diffraction data to high @xmath4 when it is to be used for pdf modeling , since a larger @xmath10 decreases the nyquist interval , and makes accessible smaller structural details .",

    "<S> we have systematically studied the optimal real - space sampling of atomic pair distribution data by comparing refinement results from oversampled and resampled data . based on nickel and a complex perovskite system , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the optimal sampling is bounded by the nyquist interval described by the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem . near this sampling interval , </S>",
    "<S> the data points in the pdf are minimally correlated , which results in more reliable uncertainty prediction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , refinements using sparsely sampled data may run many times faster than using oversampled data . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation establishes a theoretically sound limit on the amount of information contained in the pdf , which has ramifications towards how pdf data are modeled . </S>"
