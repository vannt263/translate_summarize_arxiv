    "current evidence points towards the success of the rhic program at recreating the long - sought quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , scheduled to be studied in more detail at the lhc . in the range of accessible temperatures ( of order a few times the deconfinement temperature )",
    ", the qgp appears to behave as a strongly - coupled liquid .",
    "the phenomenon of jet quenching observed at rhic indicates that partons crossing the qgp experience a significant energy loss @xcite , and so necessitates a framework for studying energy loss at strong coupling .",
    "motivated by this , a considerable effort has been invested in the study of strongly - coupled thermal non - abelian plasmas by means of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . at our present stage of knowledge , contact with the real - world qgp produced at rhic or lhc will be feasible only if qcd can be reasonably well approximated by at least one of the various ` qcd - like ' gauge theories whose dual description is known . in the past few years , encouraging signs in this direction have emerged even for the most rudimentary example @xcite , @xmath4 @xmath0 super - yang - mills ( sym ) , which at zero temperature is completely unlike qcd , but at finite temperature is in various respects analogous to deconfined qcd . studies of energy loss have been conducted considering various types of partonic probes of the plasma , including quarks @xcite , mesons @xcite , baryons @xcite , gluons @xcite and @xmath5-quarks @xcite . for concreteness ,",
    "in what follows we will restrict attention to the case of a quark .",
    "the rate of energy loss determined analytically in the seminal works @xcite was only shown to apply for an isolated quark in the stationary or late - time regimes ( i.e. , when the quark moves at constant velocity , under the influence of an external force which precisely cancels the drag force exerted by the plasma , or when the quark has decelerated solely under the action of this drag force for a long period of time , and is about to come to rest ) . in the actual experimental setup ,",
    "however , the configuration is neither stationary nor asymptotic : the quark is not externally forced , and slows down under the influence of the plasma , whose finite spatial and temporal extent imply that the late - time regime is not generically accessible",
    ". moreover , the real - world quark is not isolated , but is created within the plasma together with an antiquark . in the present text",
    "we will explore to what extent the rate of energy loss is affected by these three issues .",
    "for our analysis we need two ingredients : a strongly - coupled thermal sym plasma , and a quark that traverses it .",
    "the plasma is known to be described in dual language by a schwarzschild black hole ( actually , black threebrane ) in asymptotically anti - de sitter space , whose hawking temperature is identified with @xmath6 .",
    "more explicitly , to study @xmath0 @xmath7 sym with coupling @xmath8 and temperature @xmath6 , we must consider type iib string theory on the ( ads - schwarzschild)@xmath9 geometry @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the string length , and @xmath12 is the location of the event horizon . in our work",
    "the @xmath13 factor of this geometry will play no direct role . notice that the field theory temperature is identified with the hawking temperature @xmath14 of the black hole .",
    "it is also known that a static heavy quark corresponds to a static and purely radial string extending down from the horizon at @xmath15 to a location @xmath16 where it ends on a stack of @xmath17 d7-branes @xcite .",
    "these branes cover the four gauge theory directions @xmath18 , and are spread along the radial ads direction from @xmath19 to @xmath16 , where they ` end ' ( meaning that the @xmath20 that they are wrapped on shrinks down to zero size ) .",
    "the d7-brane parameter @xmath21 is related to the lagrangian mass @xmath22 of the quark through @xcite @xmath23~.\\ ] ] for applications of this formalism to phenomenology , we must choose values of the mass parameter @xmath21 based on the charm and bottom quark masses , @xmath24 gev .",
    "following @xcite , this translates into @xmath25 for charm and @xmath26 for bottom .",
    "the string dynamics follows as usual from the nambu - goto action @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) denotes the induced metric on the worldsheet",
    ".    in the case of vanishing temperature ( @xmath30 ) , we are left in ( [ metric ] ) with a pure ads geometry , and ( [ zm ] ) reduces to @xmath31 one way to verify that the string is indeed dual to a quark is to compute the expectation value of the gluonic field in the presence of this object .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath32~.\\ ] ] for @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , this is just the coulombic field expected ( by conformal invariance ) for a pointlike charge @xcite . for finite @xmath35",
    "the profile is still coulombic far away from the origin but in fact becomes non - singular at the location of the quark .",
    "we thus learn that the string is actually dual not to a pointlike ` bare ' quark , but to a ` composite ' or ` dressed ' quark , including its gluonic cloud .",
    "the size of this cloud is precisely the length scale @xmath21 defined in ( [ zmnoplasma ] ) , which is therefore understood to be the analog of the compton wavelength for our non - abelian source .    below we will also be interested in the description of a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the iib strings we have introduced above are oriented , and a state with two oppositely oriented purely radial strings would correspond to a quark and antiquark that are merely superposed .",
    "with such boundary conditions , however , the configuration with lowest energy is given by a _",
    "single _ @xmath36-shaped string that has both of its endpoints at @xmath16 .",
    "this can again be verified by computing the corresponding gluonic profile .",
    "the result for infinitely massive quarks , at distances @xmath37 much larger than the dipole separation @xmath38 , is @xcite @xmath39 which has a more rapid falloff than ( [ fsquaredq ] ) , as expected for an overall color - neutral source . in ( [ fsquaredqqbar ] ) beyond the usual electrostatic dipole behavior @xmath40 is due to the large @xmath41 limit @xcite . ]",
    "an important generic lesson of this type of computations is that the string codifies not only the quarks , but also the gluonic field generated by them . roughly speaking , the would - be bare quarks / antiquarks are dual to the string endpoints , and the surrounding gluonic field is dual to the body of the string . in other words",
    ", we have learned through ads / cft that the usual ` qcd ' string exists even for non - confining theories , and actually lives in a curved 5 ( @xmath42 5)-dimensional geometry .    combining the two ingredients above , we know that a quark in a strongly - coupled sym plasma is described by a string on the schwarzschild - ads geometry ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the drag force felt by this quark when moving along a trajectory @xmath43 can then be deduced simply by having the string endpoint follow this same trajectory , and determining the pull of the body of the string which trails behind it .",
    "the works @xcite derived an analytic formula for the corresponding rate of energy loss , @xmath44 as mentioned in the introduction , this formula was proven to hold only in the stationary or late - time regimes , so _ a priori _ it is not clear whether it could be relevant under conditions analogous to those of the experimental setup .",
    "this is the question that we now wish to examine . to orient ourselves",
    ", we will first inquire about the rate of energy loss for an accelerating quark in vacuum , whose dual description involves the string moving on pure ads spacetime . in this case",
    "we will have full analytic control over the system , which will allow us to develop some intuition on the problem at hand .",
    "additionally , our vacuum analysis will provide a useful benchmark against which the finite - temperature results can be compared .",
    "a quark that accelerates in vacuum would be expected to emit chromoelectromagnetic radiation .",
    "the first definite characterization of the radiation rate off an accelerating quark by means of ads / cft was worked out in an important paper by mikhailov @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this author was able to solve the highly nonlinear equation of motion for a string on ads@xmath45 that follows from ( [ nambugoto ] ) , for an _ arbitrary _ timelike trajectory of the string endpoint dual to a heavy quark ! in terms of the coordinates used in ( [ metric ] ) ( where for now @xmath46 ) , his solution is @xmath47 with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 the worldline of the string endpoint at the ads boundary or , equivalently , the worldline of the dual , infinitely massive , quark parametrized by the proper time @xmath50 defined through @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .    combining ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ mikhsol ] ) ,",
    "the induced metric on the worldsheet is found to be @xmath53 implying in particular that the constant-@xmath50 lines are null , a fact that plays an important role in mikhailov s construction . in the solution ( [ mikhsol ] ) ,",
    "the behavior at time @xmath54 of the string segment located at radial position @xmath55 ( which according to our discussion in the previous section codifies the behavior of the gluonic field at the length scale @xmath55 @xcite ) is completely determined by the behavior of the quark / endpoint at a retarded time @xmath56 obtained by projecting back toward the boundary along the null line at fixed @xmath50 . from the @xmath57 component of ( [ mikhsol ] ) , parametrizing the quark worldline by @xmath58 instead of @xmath50 , and using @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , this amounts to @xmath61 where the endpoint velocity @xmath62 is meant to be evaluated at @xmath63 . in these same terms , the spatial components of ( [ mikhsol ] ) can be formulated as @xmath64    working in the static gauge @xmath65 , @xmath66 , the total energy of a string that extends all the way down to the boundary i.e. , with @xmath67 , corresponding to an infinitely massive quark follows from the nambu - goto action ( [ nambugoto ] ) as @xmath68 using ( [ tret ] ) and ( [ xmikh ] ) , mikhailov was able to reexpress this energy ( via a change of integration variable @xmath69 ) as a local functional of the quark trajectory , @xmath70 ^ 2}{\\left(1-\\vec{v}^{\\,2}\\right)^3 } + e_q(\\vec{v}(t))~,\\ ] ] where of course @xmath71 .",
    "( a similar expression can be written down for the total string momentum . )",
    "the second term in the above equation arises from a total derivative that was not explicitly written down by mikhailov , but can easily be worked out to be @xcite @xmath72 which gives the expected lorentz - invariant dispersion relation for the quark .",
    "the energy split achieved in ( [ emikh ] ) therefore admits a clear and pleasant physical interpretation : @xmath73 ( associated only with information of the string endpoint ) is the intrinsic energy of the quark at time @xmath74 , and the integral over @xmath63 ( associated with the body of the string ) encodes the accumulated energy _ lost _ by the quark to its gluonic field over all times prior to @xmath74 .",
    "no less remarkable is the fact that the rate of energy loss for the quark in this strongly - coupled non - abelian theory is found to be in precise agreement with the standard lienard formula from classical electrodynamics ! the ads / cft correspondence thus teaches us that , in this very unfamiliar non - linear setting , the energy loss turns out to depend only locally on the quark worldline .",
    "this feature has been argued in @xcite to lead to an upper bound for the energy of a quark at finite temperature .",
    "it is interesting to consider how these results are modified in the case @xmath75 , where the mass @xmath35 of the quark given by ( [ zmnoplasma ] ) is large but not infinite . in this case",
    ", we ought to impose boundary conditions on the string not at @xmath19 but at @xmath16 : given the worldline @xmath43 of the quark , we must require that the string worldsheet satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , we need only determine the behavior of the string in the region @xmath77 .    our task is to reexpress ( [ mikhsol ] ) in terms of the data @xmath43 at the new boundary @xmath16 , instead of the ( now merely auxiliary ) data at the ads boundary @xmath19 , which we will henceforth distinguish with a tilde : @xmath78 . for simplicity , we will carry out this translation explicitly only in a setup where the quark moves purely along direction @xmath79 , which is all that we will need for our analysis in subsequent sections .    as was explained in @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to rewrite the velocity @xmath80 and acceleration @xmath81 of the ` auxiliary endpoint ' at @xmath19 in terms of the velocity @xmath82 of the actual string endpoint and the momentum density @xmath83 , which , when evaluated at @xmath16 , controls the external force @xmath84 acting on the string endpoint , or equivalently , on the quark .",
    "one finds @xmath85 where we have abbreviated @xmath86 . using ( [ emikh ] )",
    "( decorated with appropriate tildes ) , we can then express the total energy of the string at time @xmath74 in the form @xmath87 as before , the first term represents the accumulated energy lost by the quark at all times prior to @xmath74 : it is the generalization to the @xmath88 case of the lienard formula ( [ emikh ] ) deduced by mikhailov ( indeed , for @xmath33 the integrand in ( [ emikhf ] ) reduces to the lienard expression for motion in one dimension , @xmath89 ) .",
    "the second term again denotes a surface term and gives the modified dispersion relation for the finite - mass quark , @xmath90 similar expressions can be written down for the momentum @xcite .",
    "notice that ( [ edrf ] ) differs from the result expected for a pointlike quark , @xmath91 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the fundamental source dual to a string that terminates at @xmath75 is indeed _ not pointlike_. according to the standard dictionary mapping the radial coordinate in the curved geometry to a length scale in the gauge theory @xcite , it has a linear size of order @xmath21 .",
    "it is only because of this extended nature that , as we saw above , to characterize its state one needs to specify not only the velocity @xmath3 but also the parameter @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) that encodes its shape .",
    "the crucial point here is that , as we already noted below ( [ fsquaredq ] ) , the source in question should not be thought of as a bare quark , but as a ` dressed ' or ` constituent ' quark , surrounded by a gluonic cloud with thickness @xmath21 @xcite",
    ".    another salient feature of the energy of the quark given by the expression ( [ edrf ] ) is the fact that it diverges as the value of the external force approaches @xmath94 the reason for this is easy to understand on the string theory side . to exert a force @xmath92 on the string endpoint , within the d7-branes we must turn on an electric field that has strength @xmath95 at @xmath16 .",
    "the physical origin of the bound on the force is the fact that , for @xmath96 , the creation of open strings is energetically favored , and so the system is unstable . according to ( [ edrf ] ) , then , the energy of the constituent quark diverges precisely at the point where the external force becomes capable of nucleating quark - antiquark pairs .    to summarize , from our study of a quark accelerating in vacuum we learn that : _",
    "i ) _ the total energy of the string includes not only the intrinsic quark energy , but also the accumulated energy previously radiated by the quark ; _ ii ) _ the quark dispersion relation arises from a surface term on the string worldsheet ; _ iii ) _ the radiated energy depends localy on the quark worldline ; _ iv ) _ when the quark has a finite mass , it is automatically non - pointlike , and there are consequently non - trivial modifications to its dispersion relation and radiation rate .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to make an additional observation .",
    "it is natural to expect the energy split achieved in ( [ emikh ] ) or ( [ emikhf ] ) to be somehow reflected in the geometry of the string worldsheet .",
    "it is interesting then that , on the string worldsheet dual to a quark undergoing arbitrary accelerated motion , there appears a black hole @xcite , whose event horizon naturally divides the worldsheet into two causally disconnected regions ( the appearance of a worldsheet black hole had also been noted previously at finite temperature @xcite ) .",
    "it seems plausible then to interpret the regions outside and inside the black hole as corresponding respectively to the quark and the gluonic field , and postulate that the energy flow across this horizon should be related to the energy radiated by the quark @xcite .",
    "this possibility has been studied more closely in @xcite .",
    "having understood the rate of energy loss for a heavy quark that moves in the sym vacuum , in this section we restore @xmath97 and consequently @xmath98 in the metric ( [ metric ] ) , to study the same quantity in the case where the quark moves through a thermal plasma . a thorough generalization of mikhailov s analytic results @xcite to this finite temperature setup would require finding the exact solution to the nambu - goto equation of motion for the string on the ads - schwarzschild background , for any given trajectory of the string endpoint at @xmath99 .",
    "sadly , we have not been able to accomplish this feat .",
    "nevertheless , based on the results discussed in the previous subsection , we expect the total energy of the string at any given time to again decompose into a surface term that encodes the intrinsic energy of the quark and an integrated local term that reflects the energy lost by the quark .",
    "there are two easy cases where one can show analytically that this expectation is borne out .",
    "the first is the case of a static quark , where there is of course no energy loss , and the string energy is correspondingly given by a pure surface contribution , @xmath100 which we naturally interpret as the rest mass of the quark in the thermal medium .",
    "an important difference with respect to the @xmath101 case analyzed in the previous subsection is that here the surface contribution arises not only from the lower ( @xmath16 ) but also from the upper ( @xmath15 ) endpoint of the string .",
    "this is in fact the generic situation in the @xmath102 ( @xmath97 ) case . since @xmath12 marks the position of an event horizon , for any finite coordinate time @xmath74 the value of the surface contribution at @xmath12 is not influenced by the behavior of the @xmath103 portion of the string , but depends only on the string s configuration at @xmath104 .",
    "the same interpretation can be then carried over to the gauge theory : for arbitrary finite - temperature configurations , the terms in the quark dispersion relation arising from the upper string endpoint will encode a contribution to the energy of the state that depends solely on the initial configuration of the quark@xmath42plasma system . throughout the evolution ,",
    "causality guarantees that the behavior of the sym fields at spatial infinity can only be affected by the initial configuration at @xmath104 , so we can equivalently think of the surface terms at @xmath12 as encoding information on the asymptotic boundary conditions for the system . indeed , for dynamical processes , the radial location @xmath15 in ads - schwarzschild corresponds to the deep ir of the gauge theory .",
    "the only other finite - temperature solution that is known analytically corresponds to a quark moving at constant velocity @xmath3 , and takes the form @xcite @xmath105~.\\ ] ] imitating the procedure of the previous section , we can rewrite this solution by slicing it along null worldsheet curves , @xmath106 allowing the total energy of the string to be split into @xcite @xmath107~.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] as expected , the integrated term in the top line recovers the result for the stationary rate of energy loss ( [ eplossgubser ] ) .",
    "the terms in the second and third line , then , codify the energy @xmath73 intrinsic to the quark , including , as we discussed above , contributions dependent on the initial or boundary conditions .",
    "the total momentum of the string can be processed similarly .",
    "having gained some intuition from the analysis of a quark moving at constant speed relative to the strongly - coupled plasma , let us now turn our attention to the more general situation where the quark accelerates . for concreteness",
    ", we will consider the early - time behavior of a quark initially at rest , which is accelerated along a line by a time - dependent external force that is turned off after a short interval , allowing the quark to move thereafter only under the influence of the plasma .",
    "in @xcite we integrated numerically the nambu - goto equation of motion for the dual string .",
    "our results show a qualitative difference between the initial stage ( @xmath108 ) where the quark is accelerated by means of the external force @xmath109 , and the second stage ( @xmath110 ) where it moves only under the influence of the plasma . in the former stage ,",
    "the rate of energy loss , for values of @xmath35 in the neighborhood of the charm or bottom masses , is in fact nearly identical to the corresponding rate in vacuum , given by the modified lienard formula ( [ emikhf ] ) . in what follows we will elaborate a bit on the behavior in the latter stage , which would appear to be more relevant from the phenomenological perspective .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the energy lost by the quark in both stages can be found in @xcite .    ) from our numerical integration ( in red ) compared against ( [ vhkkkynr ] ) with the value of @xmath111 deduced in @xcite ( in black ) , and ( [ vhkkkynr ] ) with @xmath111 chosen to fit the data ( in light blue ) , for a ) @xmath112 and b ) @xmath113.,width=264,height=188 ]    ( 0,0 ) ( 0,0.3)@xmath74 ( -6.5,5.1)@xmath3    ) from our numerical integration ( in red ) compared against ( [ vhkkkynr ] ) with the value of @xmath111 deduced in @xcite ( in black ) , and ( [ vhkkkynr ] ) with @xmath111 chosen to fit the data ( in light blue ) , for a ) @xmath112 and b ) @xmath113.,width=264,height=188 ]    ( 0,0 ) ( 0,0.3)@xmath74 ( -6.5,5.1)@xmath3    the most direct way to inquire whether the output of our numerical integration for the accelerated quark conforms to the the constant - velocity ( or late - time ) results of @xcite is to compare the corresponding quark trajectories . if one assumes a dispersion relation @xmath114 as in @xcite ( which is what the vacuum expression ( [ edrf ] ) predicts in the unforced case ) , then the rate of energy loss ( [ eplossgubser ] ) is equivalent to the statement that the friction coefficient @xmath115 takes the constant value @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion for the quark is then @xmath117 whose solution is @xcite @xmath118 in our numerical results @xmath119 , so we are only able to test the non - relativistic version of ( [ vhkkky ] ) , @xmath120 ( and , since our integration is limited to small time intervals , we would in effect see just the linear portion of this function ) . a comparison between this analytic prediction and our numerical results for @xmath121 is given in fig .  [ vfig ] .",
    "it is evident from this plot that , in the early stage of motion covered by our analysis , the quark dissipates energy at a rate much lower than the late - time result of @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath122 the late - time friction coefficient is respectively @xmath123 , but our numerical results for @xmath124 are best approximated by @xmath125 .",
    "the relation between energy loss and the appearance of a black hole on the worldsheet in this finite temperature setting had been noted already in @xcite for the case of a stationary configuration .",
    "the non - stationary case and the parallel with the zero temperature situation were discussed in @xcite .",
    "an interesting prediction of ads / cft is the existence of a subluminal limiting velocity @xmath126 for the quark traversing the plasma .",
    "this follows simply from the fact that the quark velocity is dual to the _ coordinate _ velocity of the string endpoint , and @xmath127 corresponds to a _ proper _ velocity at @xmath16 equal to that of light @xcite . a more general bound involving the external force @xmath128",
    "can be derived by requiring the nambu - goto square root to remain real @xcite , which reduces to @xmath129 when @xmath130 .",
    "this same restriction on the velocity can be seen to arise from microscopic calculations of the meson spectrum @xcite .",
    "its validity for isolated quarks has been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , in the experimental setup the heavy quark is created within the plasma together with its corresponding antiquark , and the presence of the latter would be expected to substantially modify the gluonic fields in the vicinity of the quark , consequently affecting its evolution . in @xcite , building upon the previous work @xcite , we have numerically studied the evolution of a heavy quark and antiquark that are created within the plasma at time @xmath131 and then separate back to back . in dual language , this corresponds to a string with both of its endpoints on the d7-branes at @xmath16 , such that the endpoints are initially at the same spatial location but have initial velocities in opposite directions .    in setting up the problem",
    ", one realizes that on the gauge theory side there are actually two distinct quark - antiquark configurations : the product of a fundamental @xmath1 and an antifundamental @xmath2 can lead to a @xmath1-@xmath2 pair either in the singlet or the adjoint representation of the @xmath7 gauge group .",
    "interestingly , we find that there is a counterpart to this in the gravity side , because there are precisely two distinct types of consistent initial conditions for the string .",
    "the most obvious possibility is a string that is completely pointlike at @xmath131 @xcite , and then expands into a @xmath36-shape as its endpoints separate . through the standard recipe for correlation functions",
    "@xcite , it is clear that , initially , this configuration sets up no long - range chromoelectromagnetic field , and so describes the singlet .",
    "the only other allowed possibility is a string that is initially linelike @xcite , extending from @xmath21 all the way up to @xmath12 , and expands for @xmath132 into a @xmath133-shape .",
    "such linelike string is precisely the system considered in @xcite to model a color source in the adjoint representation . due to its extended nature",
    ", it sets up long - range supergravity fields that translate into a long - range gluonic field profile , indicative of a source with net color charge .",
    "curiously , we find that the initial quark velocity is freely adjustable in the adjoint , but not the singlet , configuration in the latter case it is invariably fixed at the limiting value @xmath127 .",
    "as the quark and antiquark separate , we expect them to eventually enter the late - time regime where their rate of energy loss is given by ( [ eplossgubser ] ) and their trajectory is given by ( [ vhkkky ] ) ( with @xmath134 and @xmath135 regarded as adjustable parameters ) .",
    "the agreement between the analytic and late - time numeric results is most cleanly seen if instead of comparing graphs of @xmath136 or @xmath124 for the quark ( where one would need to look at @xmath137 ) , one examines the plots of @xmath138 , where the analytic behavior for constant @xmath111 takes the simple form @xmath139~,\\ ] ] which is linear with slope @xmath140 near the final rest point @xmath141 ( whose value is meant to be adjusted to fit the data ) .",

    "the dotted curves show the results of our numerical integration , contrasted against fits in solid red that use the analytic expression ( [ constmuvx ] ) , with the value @xmath143 obtained in @xcite and an optimal choice of the stopping distance @xmath144 .",

    "[ stage2fig ] , we see that there is an initial period where the behavior differs from the late - time frictional evolution ( [ constmuvx ] ) .",
    "this difference is clearly more significant for the singlet than the adjoint case . for values of the mass in the neighborhood of the charm or bottom masses ,",
    "our numerical results indicate that the initial evolution is essentially identical to what it would be in the absence of the plasma .",
    "this picture seems rather close to the phenomenological discussion given in @xcite ( in the context of collisional energy loss ) : when the singlet quark - antiquark pair is formed within the plasma , there is a delay before the interaction between the newly created sources and the plasma can set up the long range gluonic field profile that is responsible for the late - time dissipation . to examine in more detail the transition to the late - time behavior ( [ constmuvx ] ) , for a variety of trajectories we can determine the point @xmath147 beyond which the numeric @xmath138 curve agrees with the analytic curve ( [ constmuvx ] ) to a given accuracy @xmath148 .",

    "the results are schematically indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ stage2fig ] .    by the time when the quark moves beyond @xmath150 and therefore enters the late - time regime , it is certainly insensitive to the presence of the antiquark .",
    "it is natural then to ask how the transition distance @xmath150 compares against ( half of ) the length @xmath151 beyond which the quark and antiquark are screened from each other by the plasma .",
