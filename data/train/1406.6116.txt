    "the immense stellar winds and uv radiation from massive stars present in a star - forming region have dramatic impact on the immediate vicinity .",
    "the propagating ionisation fronts can either curb star formation by dispersing surrounding gas , or on the contrary , may induce the next - generation star formation .",
    "elmegreen & lada ( 1977 ) proposed that the expanding ionisation front plays a constructive role in inciting a sequence of star formation activities in the neighbourhood .    out of a number of processes which induce star formation at the periphery of an hii region ,",
    "the `` collect & collapse '' and `` radiation driven implosion '' ( rdi ) processes are frequently discussed in the literature . in the `",
    "collect and collapse ' scenario , the material accumulated by the expanding ionisation front and shock front of the hii region becomes gravitationally unstable , so it fragments and collapses to form stars ( elmegreen @xmath1 lada 1977 ) . in the rdi scenario ,",
    "a pre - existing dense clump is exposed to the ionising radiation from a massive star or stars , and the photoionisation induced shock compresses the head part of the clump to collapse , which consequently leads to formation of stars ( e.g. , bertoldi 1989 , lefloch @xmath1 lazareff 1995 ) .",
    "the aligned elongated distribution of young stellar objects ( ysos ) in a small molecular cloud is considered as an observational signature of the rdi process ( ogura et al .",
    "2002 , lee et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) are small molecular clouds found near the edges of evolved hii regions , with the bright rims facing the ionising stars .",
    "their morphology and physical conditions match well with the theoretical models of rdi ( e.g. , bertoldi 1989 ) , so brcs are generally believed to be the sites of rdi .",
    "many brcs are indeed associated with herbig - haro ( hh ) objects and infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) point sources indicative of recent star formation .",
    "sugitani , fukui @xmath1 ogura ( 1991 ) ( hereafter sfo91 ) and sugitani @xmath1 ogura ( 1994 ) compiled catalogues of 89 brcs associated with iras point sources in the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "near infrared ( nir ) imaging revealed elongated aggregates of ysos around brcs with bluer ( presumably older ) stars closer to the ionising source ( sugitani et al .",
    "it is thus proposed that star formation propagates along the axis of the brc as the ionisation / shock front advances further into the molecular cloud .",
    "these authors named this phenomenon as the `` small scale sequential star formation '' ( _ s@xmath2f _ ) .",
    "ogura et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter referred as _",
    "paper i _ ) undertook _",
    "bvi@xmath3 _ photometry of four aggregates , brcs 11ne , 12 , 14 and 37 , and showed quantitatively that the ysos inside or on the bright rims tend to have younger mean ages than those outside , as expected from the @xmath4 hypothesis .",
    "chauhan et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter referred as _ paper ii _ ) extended the study to a few more brcs and confirmed the general age gradients .    recently , on the basis of observational characteristics of the brcs , morgan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that not all of them are undergoing triggered star formation and refined the sfo91 catalogue by classifying brcs into triggered or non - triggered samples . according to morgan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the triggered brcs are expected to follow three observational criteria : ( 1 )  presence of the ionised boundary layer ( an indicator of strong interaction between the hii region and molecular cloud ) using 21  cm emission feature from nrao / vla sky survey ( nvss ) , ( 2 )  presence of midcourse space experiment ( msx ) emission ( which traces the photon - dominated regions ) , and ( 3 )  presence of submillimeter emission ( which traces the dense cores inside the cloud ) .",
    "the present work aims to identify and characterise the young stellar population associated with brc5 , brc7 and brc39 in order ( i )  to study the spatial distributions of the ysos on small scales , ( ii )  to examine the age gradients between the yso samples inside / on and outside brcs , and ( iii )  to study the global star formation in the regions .",
    "section  2 describes the data sets used in the study .",
    "section  3 presents a short description of each brc studied in this work .",
    "section  4 describes the methodology to identify and characterise the yso population using near- to far - infrared photometry .",
    "sections  5 describes the determination of various physical parameters of the ysos based on the colour - magnitude diagrams and the fitting of the spectral energy distribution models .",
    "section 6 describes star formation scenario in the studied brcs . in section 7",
    "we conclude with the main results of the present work .",

    "2008 + @xmath6 karr & martin 2003 + @xmath7 chauhan et al . 2011a +      brcs5 and 7 both host small clusters / aggregates of ysos .",
    "the clustering in brc7 is prominent , visible in 2mass @xmath8 as well as in irac and wise images .",
    "its formation may be the result of the implosion of the original cloud which has now receded slowly due to the photoevaporation of the molecular material .",
    "the slightly elongated morphology of the cluster further strengthens the preposition .",
    "we examined the elongation of the cluster and the distribution of nir excess sources and of class  i / ii sources obtained from the irac / wise photometry as well as the symmetry axis of the cloud . in the case of brc7 the direction from the mean position of the three most massive stars in ic1805 to the iras source ( as marked in fig .",
    "7b ) is nearly parallel to the elongation direction of the brc , suggesting that the cloud has been strongly affected by the uv radiation from the luminous stars .",
    "however , the distribution of the class  ii sources has a slightly different elongation direction from that to the massive stars . instead , the elongated distribution points to an o6 v star ( bd@xmath960497 ) .",
    "this suggests that initially the influence of bd@xmath960497 may have been dominant in forming and shaping the cluster and the present main exciting stars may have been born later than bd@xmath960497 .",
    "also the presence of millimeter cores and 21-cm continuum emission to the west of the cloud ( see fig .",
    "1b ) indicates much exposure to the uv radiation on the western side .",
    "the morphology of the tip of the rim also supports the idea .",
    "since brc5 is also located in the same hii region and its evolution must have been subjected to the same ionising stars , we also examined the possible role of bd@xmath10497 on the evolution of the cloud .",
    "lefloch , lazareff & castet ( 1997 ) , using molecular line and continuum observations , compared the distribution of ionised gas along the cloud rim and the general symmetry of the cloud .",
    "they suggested that the cloud acquired its shape in a previous episode of photoevaporation by now bygone stars and that it is presently undergoing recompression due to the radiation from the three most massive stars of the cluster located towards the south direction .",
    "bd@xmath960497 is nearly aligned with the apex of brc5 , so appears to be the most likely source responsible for the current morphology of brc5 .",
    "however , an o9.5 v star adjacent to the brc ( shown with small diamond symbol in fig .",
    "7a ) may also have some influence .    in the case of brc39",
    ", the dss2-r band image shows that neither the symmetry axis of the brc , nor the curvature of the rim points towards the most massive star hd206267 ( see figure  7c ) . to explore the possibility of alternative ionising star(s ) which may influence the geometry and evolution of the cloud",
    ", we searched for other massive stars ( earlier than b2 ) in the region using the simbad database .",
    "we found hd206773 , a b0v star and a member of tr37 , to be the closest massive star to brc39 and somewhat aligned with the apex of the cloud .",
    "the projected distance of the apex of the brc from hd206773 is nearly half of that from hd206267 , but the contribution of the uv flux from hd206773 is only 21% ( neglecting the projection effect ) of that from hd206267 .",
    "brcs are considered to be remnants from the dense parts ( cores / clumps ) of an inhomogeneous giant molecular cloud .",
    "if the original molecular cloud was big enough , it may have caused a series of triggered star formation events , leaving ob association / stellar aggregates of different generation .",
    "the spatial distribution and ages of such aggregates could be used to probe the star formation history of the giant molecular cloud . in the present section ,",
    "we discuss the global star formation in the hii regions associated with the studied brcs .",

    "( 2005 ) studied the hierarchical triggering by the superbubble in the w3/w4 region .",
    "the cluster ic1805 ( age @xmath115  myr ) is located near the center of w4 , and the nearby cluster ic1795 in w3 has a similar age of @xmath125  myr , while the embedded populations in w3-north , w3-main and w3-oh are younger ( @xmath13@xmath14  yr ) . on the other hand the age of the shell structure of the superbubble",
    "is estimated to be @xmath1510  myr",
    "( dennison et al . 2007 ) .",
    "so the shell structure should have been formed by the oldest generation of stars in the w4 region .",
    "we suspect that those stars consequently gave birth to ic 1795 and ic 1805 .",
    "then ic1795 in turn triggered the formation of currently embedded stars in w3-north , w3-main and w3-oh .",
    "similarly , the ic1805 cluster is currently triggering a younger population at its periphery , in brc5 and brc7 .",
    "patel et al . ( 1995 ) studied ic1396 using @xmath16co and @xmath17co observations .",

    "the ring is expanding at a speed of @xmath18  km  s@xmath19 .",

    ", we found a similar trend for brc39 , where the mean ages of the ysos increases from inside / on the bright rim ( @xmath11  myr ) , to outside bright rim ( @xmath24  myr ) , and further increase towards tr37 ( @xmath23  myr ) .",
    "on the basis of optical and ir observations to characterise the young stellar aggregates of brc5 , brc7 , and brc39 , we confirm the significant role played by massive stars on the star formation activity in neighboring clouds . in each bright - rimmed cloud studied here , there is a spatial orientation between the molecular cloud with an ionised rim and one or a group of massive stars .",
    "moreover , the mean ages of the ysos inside / on the rim are found to be younger than that of the stars outside , confirming the scenario of s@xmath2f .",
    "our study provides further manifestation of massive stars triggering birth of next - generation star aggregates / groups . in brc7",
