    "flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes present as stringest tests of the standart model ( sm ) as well as looking for new physics beyond the sm . in sm ,",
    "fcnc processes take place only at the loop level and therefore these decays are suppressed and for this reason experimentally their measurement is difficult .",
    "recently , b factory experiments such as belle and babar have measured fcnc decays due to the @xmath2 transition at inclusive and exclusive level [ 1,2,3,4 ] .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath3 transition is described by the effective hamiltonian and the fcnc s are represented by qcd penguin and electroweak penguin ( ew ) operators .",
    "the ew operators appear in the photon and z mediated diagrams .",
    "although it is experimentally very difficult to measure , @xmath4 decay is an extremely good and `` pure '' channel to study z mediated ew penguin contribution within the sm and its beyond [ 5,6,7,8,9 ] .",
    "another exclusive decay which is described at inclusive level by the @xmath2 transition is the baryonic @xmath5 decay . unlike the mesonic decays",
    ", the baryonic decay could maintain the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath6 transition [ 10 ] .    in this work ,",
    "we study the @xmath7 decay in the leptophobic z@xmath1 model , as a possible candidate of new physics in the ew penguin sector .",
    "the leptophobic z@xmath1 gauge bosons appear naturally in grand unified theories and string inspired @xmath8 models . here",
    "we would like to note that a similar mesonic @xmath9 decay and @xmath10 mass difference of @xmath11 meson in the context of leptophobic z@xmath1 model are studied in [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] , respectively . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly consider the leptophobic model based on @xmath8 model . in section 3 , we present the analytical expressions for the branching ratio and the longitudinal , transverse and normal polarizations of @xmath12 baryon , as well as polarization of @xmath13 . in section 4 ,",
    "we give numerical analysis and our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we briefly review the leptophobic z@xmath1 model . from gut or string - inspired point of view",
    ", the @xmath8 model [ 13 ] is a very natural extention of the sm . in this model @xmath14 gauge group",
    "remains after the symmetry breaking of the @xmath8 group .",
    "we assume that the @xmath8 group is broken through the following way @xmath15 , where @xmath14 is a linear combination of two additional @xmath16 gauge groups with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mixing angle .",
    "when all couplings are gut normalized , the interaction , lagrangian of fermions with z@xmath1 gauge boson can be written as _ int & = & -|_(q^+ y_sm)z_^  , where @xmath19 is the ratio of gauge couplings @xmath20 [ 14 ] . in the general case fermion  z@xmath1",
    "gauge boson couplings contain two arbitrary free parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 [ 15 ] . from eq.(1 ) , it follows that the z@xmath1 gauge boson can be leptophobic when @xmath23 for the lepton doublet and @xmath24 , simultaneously . in the conventional embedding",
    ", the z@xmath1 boson can be made leptophobic with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the leptophobic z@xmath1 model",
    ", fcnc s can arise through the mixing between sm fermions and exotic fermions . in principle , the mixing of the left handed fermions can lead to the large z - mediated fcnc s . in order to forbid this large z - mediated fcnc s",
    ", we consider the case when mixing take place only between the right - handed fermions .",
    "so , the mixing between right - handed ordinary and exotic fermions can induce the fcnc s when their z@xmath1 charges are different [ 16 ] . in the leptophobic z@xmath1 model ,",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath27 transition containing fcnc at tree level can be written as ^z^ & = & -u_qb^z^ |q_r^b_rz_^  .using upper experimental bounds on branching ratio for the @xmath28 [ 17 ] and @xmath29 [ 18 ] in [ 11 ] for model parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 following bounds are obtained : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "analysis of @xmath10 leads to the more stringest bound for the @xmath30 [ 12 ] : @xmath34 at @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "these constraints on @xmath38 we will use in our numerical calculations .",
    "the @xmath39 decay at quark level is described by @xmath40 transition . in the sm ,",
    "effective hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath41 transition is given by    [ effh ] h_eff^sm & = & v_tb v_ts^ * c_10 |s_(1-_5)b|_(1-_5 )  , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the fermi and fine structure constant respectively , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , @xmath46 is the wilson coefficient whose explicit form can be found in [ 17,18,19 ] .",
    "as we have already mentioned , in the leptophobic model , @xmath14 charge is zero for all the ordinary left and right handed lepton fields within the sm .",
    "however , 27 representation of @xmath8 contain new right handed neutrino which is absent in sm and it can give additional contribution to the processes due to the @xmath47 transition .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian describing @xmath48 transition can be written as [ effh ] h_eff^new & = & u_sb^z^ q__r^z^ |s_(1+_5)b|_(1+_5 )  , where @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are model dependent parameters and we take @xmath52 for simplicity . having effective hamiltonian for @xmath40 transition , our next problem is the derivation of the decay amplitude for the @xmath39 decay , which can be obtained by calculating the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian for @xmath40 transition between initial @xmath13 and final @xmath12 baryon states .",
    "it follows that the matrix elements @xmath53 are needed for calculating the decay amplitude for the @xmath7 decay .",
    "these matrix elements parametrized in terms of the form factors are as follows ( [ 20],[21 ] )    [ mel1 ] |s _ b _ b & = & |u_u__b  ,    [ mel2 ] |s _ _ 5 b _ b & = & |u_u__b where @xmath54 is the momentum transfer and @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 are the form factors .",
