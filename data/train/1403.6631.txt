    "quantum computing  @xcite can be implemented , among other options , with quantum optics  @xcite and in particular using , in lieu of qubits , the continuous variables defined by individual quantum oscillator modes of the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "these _ qumodes _ are characterized by their quadrature amplitude operators which are the analogues of the position and momentum of a harmonic oscillator @xmath0 , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the photon annihilation operator of a particular mode .",
    "operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 have a continuous spectrum .",
    "an interesting particular implementation uses the quantum optical frequency comb ( qofc ) of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo )  @xcite , whose important feature is its `` top - down '' scalability potential .",
    "this has been demonstrated experimentally by entangling a world - record 60 modes of the qofc of a single opo  @xcite .",
    "( note that 10,000 modes were also entangled sequentially in a different work , but were only accessible 2 modes at a time  @xcite . ) in the qofc experiments , the opo modes are spaced by a fsr of 0.95 ghz and the opo s nonlinear crystal provides entanglement by way of two - mode squeezing . the number of entangled modes is therefore given by the ratio of the phasematching bandwidth of the opo crystal and the fsr .",
    "when the frequency span is large , due to dispersion , the modes generated by two - mode squeezing will not be enhanced by the opo cavity eventually .",
    "so the total number of modes are limited by both quasiphasematching bandwidth and dispersion .    in this work",
    ", we studied , theoretically and experimentally , quasiphasematched parametric downconversion ( pdc ) with a monochromatic pump in periodically poled ktiopo@xmath5 ( ppktp ) pumped at 532 nm .",
    "the experimental study used sum - frequency generation .",
    "the opo dispersion is studied by theoretical simulation .",
    "we show that the quasiphasematching is very broad and flat , with a 4.74 thz theoretical full width , at 99% of the maximum efficiency , and a measured full width of 3.18 thz , which yields 6700 entangled opo modes of both orthogonal polarizations after compensating the opo dispersion .",
    "we modeled quasiphasematched ( qpm )  @xcite @xmath6 single sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) to the exact , fixed pump frequency in ppktp .",
    "this is the reverse process to pdc in an opo pumped by a monochromatic field , as used in our entanglement experiments , but its phasematching bandwidth is identical and it lends itself more easily to experimental characterization .",
    "we followed the standard plane - wave treatment in the slowly varying amplitude approximation .",
    "all classical fields are of the form @xmath7 , @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "two monochromatic , linearly polarized input fields @xmath9 at frequencies @xmath10 travel in the crystal along its @xmath11 axis and give rise to sfg field @xmath12 at @xmath13 , as well as shg fields @xmath14 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the coupled wave equations are @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the impedance of the medium , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the second - order nonlinear coefficient .",
    "the shg and sfg phase mismatches are , respectively , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the poling period . in the limit of undepleted pumps @xmath25 , can be solved simply to yield the total intensity @xmath26 we first examine the sfg phasemismatch of at room temperature as a function of the poling period @xmath24 and of sfg input  or opo `` signal ''  frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 being fixed to the pump frequency ( 563 thz , 532 nm ) of the opo .",
    "this can be done by using temperature - dependent sellmeier equations  @xcite .",
    "the result , plotted in ,     and poling period , for a 1 cm - long ppktp crystal .",
    "the red line outlines the considered qpm fwhm bandwidth , which reaches 4.74 thz at 99% of the maximum and decreases significantly in the separated branches . ]",
    "displays a remarkably broad phasematching frequency bandwidth around frequency degeneracy ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore , we can expect a 532 nm pumped , @xmath6 ppktp opo to achieve mode entanglement over a 4.74 thz full width at 99% maximum , which would yield 10,000 entangled cavity modes for an opo of 0.95 ghz fsr .",
    "analogous calculations for longer wavelengths , such as 775/1550 nm , indicate that the qpm bandwidth at 99% of the maximum should be broader by a factor of 3 .      in order to test this prediction ,",
    "we used experimental sfg with 2 newport - new focus tlb-6721 `` velocity '' tunable , continuous - wave , linearly polarized diode lasers , the sum of whose frequencies was kept constant over a 1058 - 1070 nm wavelength range . the experimental setup is shown in .",
    "the x - cut , @xmath31 mm@xmath32 ppktp crystal was poled at a period of 9.0 @xmath33 m ( at room temperature ) and provided by raicol crystals .",
    "the crystal faces were antireflection coated by advanced thin films for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 polarizations at 1064 nm and for the @xmath35 polarization at 532 nm .",
    "the ppktp crystal was placed in a temperature - stabilized oven , controlled by a peltier module driven by a wavelength electronics , model lfi-3751 temperature controller .",
    "the power of the lasers are set to be 23.0(2 ) mw and 19.6(2 ) mw , respectively , to compensate the efficiency difference caused by their different beam profiles .",
    "the power of the @xmath35-polarized beam entering the crystal are 7.7(2 ) mw and 7.0(2 ) mw respectively .",
    "both lasers were scanned in the wavelength range of 1058 - 1070 nm , keeping the average wavelength of the two lasers fixed at @xmath36 nm , so that the generated sfg green beam always had @xmath37 nm .",
    "the ir frequencies displayed by each laser were initially measured with a coherent wavemaster wavelength meter for calibration .",
    "\\(a ) shows the measured power of generated green beam ( both sfg and shg ) versus the fundamental wavelength and crystal temperature .",
    "for each temperature , about 30 data points of different wavelength are measured .",
    "the maximum sfg and shg power were @xmath38 nw and @xmath39 nw respectively , yielding maximum efficiencies for sfg and shg of @xmath40 w@xmath41 and @xmath42 w@xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we attributed these relatively modest values to the unoptimized overlap of the highly elliptical transverse intensity profiles of the diode lasers .",
    "however , we believe it is reasonable to assume that this imperfect overlap was stationary throughout the measurements .",
    "\\(b ) shows the theoretical prediction for the total green intensity .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the qualitative behavior of shg ( frequency - sharp ridges ) and sfg ( broadband feature ) match the experimental results very well .",
    "the measured frequency width of the constant sfg qpm was 3.178(2 ) thz , at least , since our measurement was limited by the tuning range of the diode lasers ( we could not make use of the full 1030 - 1070 nm tuning range of the lasers as it was not centered on the shg fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm ) .",
    "this measurement indicates that as many as 6700 cavity modes ( beyond the 60 actually measured ) could be entangled in our recent demonstration in a single opo  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the effect of the dispersion of the opo nonlinear crystal .",
    "as we just showed in the previous section , for a pump at 532 nm , the qofc can , in theory , span 4.74 thz , with at least 3.18 thz confirmed experimentally . however , due to the dispersion of the nonlinear crystal of the opo , we can expect the comb spacing to become uneven at frequencies far removed from half the pump frequency @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the constant free spectral range ( fsr ) of the opo , calculated at @xmath45 in the absence of dispersion .",
    "the emission of photon pairs by pdc into , and generation of epr entanglement between , qumodes at the following frequencies placed symmetrically around @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a nonzero integer .    in the presence of dispersion ,",
    "the fsr will depend on frequency and will be denoted by @xmath48 instead of @xmath44 , where @xmath47 is still taken to denote the @xmath49 mode from @xmath45 .",
    "let s consider the ring opo used in ref .  , which contains two identical ppktp crystals , oriented at 90@xmath50 from each other . with this arrangement",
    ", the opo cavity is polarization degenerate and the resonance condition for either linear principal polarization @xmath34 or @xmath35 of the ppktp crystals is @xmath51\\ell\\right\\ }   = j_{m } 2\\pi,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is a positive integer , @xmath53 is the speed of light , @xmath54 is the length of the air path in a round trip , @xmath55 is the length of each ppktp crystal , @xmath56 is the index of refraction of air , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the refractive indices for polarizations along the @xmath35 and @xmath34 principal axes of ktp , respectively .",
    "the opo resonance frequencies are @xmath59\\ell}\\equiv   j_m\\delta_{m}.\\ ] ] it is worth noting here that , because of the complex dependence of the left - hand side on @xmath47 , it is not _ a priori _ warranted that two consecutive frequencies @xmath60 and @xmath61 should correspond to the respective values @xmath52 and @xmath62 such that @xmath63 however , as we will soon see ( ) , the dispersion effects will always be monotonous enough that j always applies .",
    "the expected effect of normal dispersion is qualitatively depicted in : we expect the average frequency @xmath64 to veer away from @xmath45 as @xmath65 , which will lead to a severe degradation of squeezing as the shift @xmath66 reaches the opo linewidth .    .",
    "the red solid lines denote the mode pair indexed by @xmath67 and the red dashed line their average .",
    "when dispersion is negligible ( @xmath68 ) , the symmetric resonant modes @xmath69 of the opo are equally spaced by a quasi - constant fsr : ( a ) , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; ( b ) , @xmath72 , @xmath73 . when dispersion is nonnegligible ( @xmath65 ) , the resonant modes of the opo ( red solid lines ) are not equally spaced by a constant fsr : ( c ) , @xmath74 , and the pdc modes do not overlap with opo eigenmodes any more . ]",
    "we now evaluate this effect quantitatively .",
    "we can rewrite as @xmath75 where @xmath76 which assumes j holds .",
    "note that @xmath77 _ is _ an integer because @xmath45 is always placed exactly between two consecutive opo modes in our experiments  @xcite , which makes @xmath78 a half integer , like @xmath79 .",
    "we solved for each given @xmath52 , using the sellmeier equations of air  @xcite and ktp  @xcite and the parameters of our opo : @xmath80 cm , @xmath81 cm , @xmath82 ghz , @xmath83 nm . we obtained the correspondent resonant frequency @xmath84 and the resulting difference @xmath85 , the frequency shift due to dispersion , was plotted in ,        which clearly shows that the frequency is indeed a monotonous function of @xmath47 in the presence of dispersion .",
    "this confirms that j does apply for neighboring frequencies in the presence of dispersion .    of prime interest",
    "to us is the shift of the average frequency @xmath86 with respect to its dispersionless value @xmath45 .",
    "if the plot of is a straight line , this shift is exactly zero .",
    "however , the ghz scale of does nt allow us to discern whether a shift of the order of the crucial opo linewidth ( 10 mhz ) is actually present .",
    "we therefore plot the shift of the average explicitly in .",
    "as can be seen from , the shift of the average becomes significant at about 1 thz away from @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the pdc modes wo nt overlap any more with dispersion - chirped opo resonances , as in the bottom row of , and the squeezing will drop even though we are still well within the quasiphasematching bandwidth .",
    "a first - order taylor expansion of provides a simple solution for the resonant frequencies with good precision .",
    "we only study the frequency range of 1 thz around @xmath87 , where the dispersion of air is @xmath88 of the dispersion of the crystal , so we treat it as a constant : @xmath89 .",
    "the taylor expansion gives : @xmath90 it is straightforward to show that @xmath91 which yields @xmath92 when @xmath93 .",
    "therefore we can limit the expansion to the first order .",
    "the result is @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath96 we can simplify to : @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "this equation gives a good approximate solution of , whose exact solution plotted on .",
    "the linear term in @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath101 is clearly dominant , as can be seen from the plot of the exact solution in .",
    "this term shows that the resonant modes are still equally spaced , but the spacing is @xmath102 , instead of @xmath103 in the nondispersive case . for normal dispersion , @xmath104 ,",
    "so @xmath105 , which means that the resonant modes move toward the center frequency @xmath87 , however all average frequencies are unshifted : @xmath106 .",
    "note that this conclusion does not depend on the choice of @xmath87 .",
    "the second - order term in is much smaller and yields the shift of the average frequency away from @xmath45 . as mentioned earlier , this shift is significant because it can reach the order of the opo qumode linewidth .",
    "gives @xmath107 typically , @xmath108 , @xmath109 m@xmath41 , which gives @xmath110 in hertz .",
    "we can invert m to obtain the maximum number of entangled qumodes @xmath47 for which the shift of the average equals the opo half width at half maximum of 5 mhz ( the 1 khz pump linewidth is negligible ) .",
    "this is obtained for @xmath111 . at this value ,",
    "the deviation from the exact solution is only 25 khz .",
    "our theoretical prediction of the number of entangled qumodes of both polarizations , as limited by dispersion in the experiment of ref .",
    ", is therefore 3200 qumodes .",
    "it is important to note that dispersion compensation can alleviate this effect and restore the quasiphasematching bandwidth of ( at least ) 6700 entangled qumodes .",
    "it should be noted , this dispersion management has been mastered for femtosecond frequency combs , using prism compressors  @xcite , chirped mirrors  @xcite , opposite group velocity dispersion materials  @xcite .",
    "however , it might be more challenging in our case because it involves quite a narrower frequency span .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the experimental limits of the record - size , 60-qumode cluster state of our previous work in ref .  .",
    "whereas the 60-qumode figure arose from a technical limitation in the measurement of the entanglement ( limited tunability of the local oscillator ) , we expected that the experimental limitations in the actual generation of entanglement to be much laxer . here , we confirmed these expectations .",
    "we first demonstrated broadband single - period quasiphasematching of sum - frequency generation , i.e. , also of parametric downconversion , in @xmath112m - poled ppktp for 532/1064 nm up / down - converted wavelengths , then studied the opo dispersion s effect on the pdc .",
    "the 3.178(2 ) thz measured qpm bandwidth , at constant sfg efficiency , was limited by the tunability of our diode lasers and hence this result is only a lower bound for the actual qpm bandwidth .",
    "( note that even broader phasematching has been achieved for sfg , using noncollinear beams in birefringently phasematched lbo  @xcite , and for parametric dowconversion , using chirped quasiphasematching with collinear  @xcite and noncollinear  @xcite propagation . )",
    "we discovered a flat - top quasiphasematching feature in a simple single - period ppktp crystal , limiting ourselves to the characterization of the experimental situation of refs .   and  , which requires collinear modes , all uniformly coupled and matched to the same opo cavity .",
    "as it stands , this measurement indicates that as many as 6700 cavity modes ( beyond the 60 actually measured ) could be entangled in our recent demonstration in a single opo  @xcite , if dispersion in the ktp played no role .",
    "when dispersion is present , we showed that the qofc gradually becomes more unevenly spaced away from the center frequency ( half of the pump frequency ) , which leads to decreasing overlap between the pdc modes and the opo resonant modes and loss the resonant enhancement of qumode entanglement by the opo cavity .",
    "we calculated that the limit is 3200 entangled qumodes in ref .  .",
    "successful dispersion management will bring back the quasiphasematching limit of  at least  6700 qumodes .",
