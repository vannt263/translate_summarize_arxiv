    "during the last few years , intensive theoretical work and impressive experimental results and even more impressive prospects have pushed our understanding on @xmath3 decays far beyond expectations . among the large set of inclusive and exclusive @xmath3 modes ,",
    "a considerable attention has been put into @xmath4 , where experimental analyses are based on @xmath5 events in the case of the b - factories and cdf @xcite and @xmath6 events at lhcb @xcite . also , recent bounds on the @xmath7 branching ratio @xcite are very close to the sm prediction , taking into account the correction from the @xmath8 width difference to branching ratio measurements at lhcb @xcite .",
    "these modes are very sensitive to new physics contributing to right - handed currents ( since transverse asymmetries in @xmath4 measure indirectly the polarization of the virtual photon ) and to scalar and pseudo - scalar operators ( specially in the case of @xmath7 ) .",
    "the theoretical description of @xmath3 decays within and beyond the sm is given by the @xmath9 effective hamiltonian @xmath10 @xcite . in the sm the relevant operators are the electromagnetic dipole and semileptonic operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the 4-quark current - current @xmath14 and qcd - penguin @xmath15 operators and the chromo - magnetic dipole operator @xmath16 are involved at higher orders in perturbation theory . beyond the sm ,",
    "non - standard operators become important , such as the chirality - flipped operators @xmath17 , scalar @xmath18 , pseudo - scalar @xmath19 and tensor @xmath20 operators .",
    "the theoretical description of the @xmath21 decay becomes uncontrollable when the invariant dilepton mass @xmath22 approaches the threshold of @xmath23 resonance production .",
    "this happens predominantly in the vicinity of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 states , around @xmath27 gev@xmath28 .",
    "the theoretical methods used to describe the regions below ( low-@xmath22 ) and above ( large-@xmath22 ) the vetoed range are different .",
    "the effect of a finite width of the @xmath29 including two scalar resonances has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , pointing to a non - negligible impact in some observables at low-@xmath22 .",
    "however , an experimental fit to certain _ folded _ angular distributions can decouple these effects @xcite .    at large",
    "recoil , the transversity amplitudes are computed in qcd factorization in the large energy limit of the @xmath29 @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "symmetry relations between the seven heavy - to - light form factors allow one to express the amplitudes in terms of two soft form factors @xmath30 , distribution amplitudes and calculable hard kernels up to @xmath31 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "soft gluon contributions at the tail of @xmath26 resonances in the low-@xmath22 region have been computed in ref .",
    "corrections of order @xmath32 are unknown , and include symmetry - breaking contributions to form factor relations and non - factorizable contributions from distribution amplitudes .    currently , the main uncertainties in the prediction of angular observables in @xmath21 are due to unknown @xmath32 corrections and hadronic uncertainties in form factor computations from light - cone sum rules @xcite .",
    "the efforts to reduce these uncertainties in phenomenological applications have led to the identification of _ clean _ or _ optimized _ observables , defined as ratios where most of the dependence on form factors cancels .",
    "a complete list of such observables is given by @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite at low-@xmath22 and @xmath39 @xcite at high-@xmath22 .",
    "experimental analyses have focused on the measurements of the branching ratio @xmath40 , the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath41 , the longitudinal polarization fraction @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) , always integrated in a series of @xmath22 bins .",
    "cdf has measured directly the optimized observable @xmath45 @xcite , while the observables @xmath35 can be obtained indirectly from the lhcb results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and table [ jvpis ] ) .    a wealth of model - independent combined analyses of @xmath46 and @xmath47 decays have appeared recently in the literature @xcite .",
    "the differences include the statistical treatment , the set of observables included in the analysis , and the np scenarios considered .",
    "all in all , the data is compatible with the sm , as well as with the flipped - sign point @xmath48 .",
    "for a more thorough status review of @xmath3 see refs .",
    "based on the symmetries of the angular distribution discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the minimum number of observables needed to describe the full @xmath21 angular distribution can be inferred , which varies depending on whether mass and/or scalar effects are considered .",
    "a _ basis _ of angular observables can then be identified , with the property of containing a minimum number of observables from which _ any _ other observable can be obtained .",
    "the basis is not unique , but there is a subset of bases with a quality feature : they contain a maximum number of _ clean _ observables .",
    "one such bases has been constructed and studied in detail in refs .",

    "while the observables @xmath53 and @xmath38 are very much constrained by the @xmath7 branching ratio , the rest shows a good sensitivity to new physics , especially @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xcite . from the latest lhcb measurements of @xmath21 @xcite",
