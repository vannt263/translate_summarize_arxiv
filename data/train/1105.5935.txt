    "the states @xmath28 and @xmath35 with quantum numbers @xmath4 are shown to be bound , which are respectively good candidates for the charged bottomonium - like resonances @xmath5 and @xmath6 newly observed by belle collaboration .",
    "the color - singlet single channel calculation also shows that the states @xmath2 with @xmath7 , @xmath3 with @xmath8 are bound states with a few mev binding energy .",
    "recently belle collaboration reported their high precision measurement of bottomonium mass : @xmath223=$]10.87 gev @xcite .",
    "if the molecular states @xmath3 with @xmath224 really exist , it could be observed in final state @xmath204 at the belle , babar , lhc and other collaborations . due to the phase space limitation ,",

    "the hidden color channel effect is complicated in multi - quark systems . here",
    "we extend directly the quark model for colorless cluster to the colorful cluster in the study of @xmath228 and @xmath35 systems . in our calculation",
    ", the color - octet channel plays a dominate role in producing deeply bound states .",
    "if the quark - antiquark interaction in color singlet can be extended directly to color - octet by casimir scaling  @xcite , then the oge interaction will be attractive between two color - octet cluster in some multi - quark systems .",
    "so it is inevitably to produce deeply bound states for hidden - bottom states because of the too small kinetic energy .",
    "more experimental data on bottomonium - like resonances are needed to check the casimir scaling , and cast doubt on the validity of applying the chiral constituent quark model to the hidden color channel directly .",
