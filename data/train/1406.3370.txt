    "the borromean rings in figure  [ fig : br ] appear to be made out of circles , but a result of freedman and skora shows that this is an optical illusion ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the borromean rings are a special type of brunninan link : a link of @xmath1 components is one which is not an unlink , but for which every sublink of @xmath2 components is an unlink .",
    "there are an infinite number of distinct brunnian links of @xmath1 components for @xmath3 , but the borromean rings are the most famous example .",
    "this fact that the borromean rings can not be formed from three circles often comes as a surprise , but then we come to the contrasting result that although it can not be built out of circles , the borromean rings can be built out of certain sets of convex curves .",
    "for example , one can form it from two circles and an ellipse .",
    "although it is only one out of an infinite number of brunnian links of three components , it is the only one which can be built out of convex components @xcite .",
    "the convexity result is , in fact a bit stronger and shows that no 4 component brunnian link can be made out of convex components and davis generalizes this result to 5 components in @xcite .",
    "while this shows it is in some sense hard to form most brunnian links out of certain shapes , the borromean rings leave some flexibility .",
    "this leads to the question of what shapes can be used to form the borromean rings and the following surprising conjecture of matthew cook at the california institute of technology .",
    "( cook ) given any three unknotted simple closed curves in @xmath0 , they can always be arranged to form the borromean rings unless they are all circles .",
    "@xcite    [ conj : cook ]    in this paper",
    "we show that any three polygonal unknots ( consisting of straight edges meeting at a set of vertices ) can be used to form the borromean rings through rigid transformations of the components in @xmath0 together with scaling of @xmath0 applied to the individual components .",
    "note that since any knot can be approximated with a polygonal knot that is arbitrarily close to it , any set of three unknots comes arbitrarily close to forming the borromean rings : even three circles which themselves can not form the borromean rings .    while the first few sections prove that many sets of unknots do satisfy cook s conjecture we conclude in the final section with a possible counter - example to cook s conjecture .",
    "to prove our theorems we will need the following lemma about unknots and the disks they bound . throughout the paper , @xmath4 will bound a disk @xmath5 and we will abuse notation by preserving the names @xmath4 and @xmath5 even after rigid motions or scaling of the components . when we refer to a disk or sub - disk as flat or planar , we mean that it is a subset of a flat plane .    for each polygonal unknot",
    "@xmath4 we pick can pick an extremal vertex ( a vertex that is a global maximum with respect to some direction vector ) which we will call @xmath6 .",
    "the edges adjacent to @xmath6 will be called @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a unique global maximum for an unknot @xmath4 ( with respect to some direction vector ) then we may choose a disk @xmath5 whose boundary is @xmath4 and which also has the point @xmath6 as its unique global maximum in the same direction .",
    "[ lemma : extremaldisks ]    this lemma will certainly hold for the special case of polygonal unknots that we study in this paper , but we prove it in general .",
    "this can be done with a standard innermost loop argument .",
    "since there is a plane that intersects @xmath4 in @xmath6 and otherwise contains @xmath4 entirely on one side of it , we can also find a sphere tangent to the plane at @xmath6 , intersecting the knot only in @xmath6 and which otherwise contains @xmath4 entirely inside of it ( as the radius of the spheres tangent to the plane at @xmath6 goes to infinity , the spheres limit on the plane ) .",
    "now pick an embedded disk @xmath5 for @xmath4 whose interior intersects @xmath9 transversally in a minimal number of components . since @xmath10 is a single point",
    "there are no arcs of intersection in @xmath11 .",
    "this means all remaining intersections may be assumed to be circles .",
    "if the set of circles is nontrivial take an innermost circle on @xmath9 ( one of the components of @xmath11 that bounds a disk on @xmath9 disjoint on its interior from @xmath11 ) and cut and paste @xmath5 replacing the component of @xmath12 that is bounded by this circle and does not contain @xmath4 by the corresponding subset of @xmath9 . pushing the new disk slightly off of @xmath9",

    "it is not as clear that the construction from theorem  [ thm : polyplanar ] , however , could not work , where scaling was allowed . if we are allowed to scale the components , then",
    "if we scale @xmath17 up enough , then the non - circular portions become exposed to the other knots .",
    "this , therefore , might be a counter - example to conjecture  [ conj : cook ] if scaling is not permitted , but fails to produce a counterexample if it is .",
    "the exact phrasing of cook s conjecture is ambiguous since the word  arranged \" could be interpreted to allow scaling or it could be interpreted not to , but it seems more likely to exclude scaling .",
    "it is highly possible that this nuance could be the difference between the conjecture being true or false !",
    "it is also worth noting that while from afar figure  [ fig : untorus ] appears to consist of arcs of circles as desired , due to the nature of computer generated images , if you truly look closely the knot pictured consists of straight segments that are very , very short .",
    "no matter how short they are , this means that two computer generated  circles , \" which also would consist of short straight segments , but would look like circles , together with the knot pictured would in truth be able to form the borromean rings without scaling by theorem  [ thm : polyplanar ] .",
