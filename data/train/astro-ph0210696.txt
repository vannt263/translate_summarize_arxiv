    "the pace of discovery in the field of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy has been accelerating over the last few years . with it ,",
    "the basic elements of the cosmological model have been falling into place : the nature of the initial seed fluctuations that through gravitational instability generated all of the structure in the universe , and the mixture of matter - energy constituents that drives its expansion . since even reviews written",
    "a scant year ago ( e.g. @xcite ) seem out of date today , we will focus mainly on the fundamental physical elements that enter into cosmic microwave background observables .    in 1992 ,",
    "the cobe dmr experiment reported the first detection of cosmological anisotropy in the temperature of the cmb @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 variations in temperature detected on scales larger than the @xmath1 resolution provided strong support for the gravitational instability paradigm .",
    "these variations represent the direct imprint of initial gravitational potential perturbations through their redshifting effect on the cmb photons , called the sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , and are of the right amplitude to explain the large - scale structure of the universe . from 1992 - 1998 , a host of experiments ( see references in @xcite ) detected a rise and fall in the level of anisotropy from degree scales to arcminute scales . in the following two years , the toco @xcite , boomerang @xcite , and maxima @xcite experiments measured a clearly defined first peak in the spectrum and provided empirical evidence that the small scale anisotropy is dominated by coherent acoustic phenomena , long predicted to exist @xcite .",
    "this first peak measurement has subsequently been confirmed by several groups , with the best measurement to date from the archeops experiment @xcite .",
    "these measurements firmly establish initial gravitational potential or curvature fluctuations as the primary source of structure in the universe ( c.f .",
    "cosmological defect models @xcite ) , provide clear evidence that the universe is close to spatially flat and , in conjunction with other cosmological measurements of the dark matter , an indicate that there is a component of missing or dark energy .",
    "these findings provide support for the inference from distant supernovae that the expansion is currently accelerating under the influence of the dark energy @xcite .    in 2001 , the dasi and boomerang @xcite experiments announced a detection of secondary acoustic peaks in the spectrum which was subsequently confirmed by the vsa experiment @xcite .",
    "these experiments provided a precise measurement of the baryon - photon ratio that is in excellent agreement with inferences from big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. @xcite ) , lending further confidence in the underlying cosmological model .",
    "moreover they provided the first direct evidence that dark , non - baryonic , matter exists in the early universe . in the past year , two more predicted phenomena have been discovered : the dissipation of the acoustic peaks at small scales by the cbi experiment @xcite and , following a series of increasingly tighter upper limits @xcite , the polarization of the anisotropy by the dasi experiment @xcite .",
    "these observed phenomena provide the best internal evidence that the physical assumptions underlying the interpretation of the peaks are justified .",
    "the past few years have been an era of milestones for experiments and millstones for theoretical speculation .",
    "the standard cosmological paradigm of structure formation by gravitational instability of cold dark matter in a nearly homogeneous and isotropic universe has been so thoroughly tested that it is extremely difficult to find viable contenders that differ in any fundamental way .",
    "the acoustic peaks are furthermore strikingly consistent with two fundamental predictions of simple inflationary models of the early universe : a flat spatial geometry and a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of initial curvature fluctuations .",
    "alternatives to inflation , must now be nearly indistinguishable phenomenologically to be consistent with the data ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the future may see a reversal of this trend as cmb experiments and theory focus on mysteries at the two opposite ends of time .",
    "the detailed physics of inflation ( or contending theories ) and the dark energy remains unexplained and largely unexplored .",
    "here the increase in precision , and perhaps more importantly accuracy , expected from future experiments will allow studies of the associated phenomena : the statistical properties of the anisotropy , features in the initial curvature spectrum , subtle effects in the polarization , and the secondary anisotropy generated by structure in the universe . in fact secondary anisotropy from unresolved clusters of galaxies may have been detected recently by the cbi @xcite and bima @xcite experiments .",
    "key past and future milestones are summarized in table 1 . in this review",
    "we shall try to place this somewhat bewildering array of phenomena in its cosmological context .",
    "we begin with a description of cmb observables in  [ sec : observables ] , proceed through the physical basis of their generation in  [ sec : plasma ] to the phenomenology of the acoustic peaks and secondary anisotropy in  [ sec : acoustic]-[sec : secondary ] . finally in  [ sec : discussion ] we outline future milestones of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy .",

    "the fundamental observable in the cmb is the intensity of radiation per unit frequency per polarization at each point in the sky .",
    "the polarization state of the radiation in a direction of sky denoted @xmath2 is described by the intensity matrix @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electric field vector and the brackets denote time averaging .    the radiation is measured to be a blackbody of @xmath5k ( 95% cl ) @xcite with fractional variations across the sky at the @xmath0 level @xcite and fractional polarization at the @xmath6 level @xcite . it is then convenient to describe the observables by a temperature fluctuation matrix decomposed in the pauli basis ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath7 where we have chosen the constant of proportionality so that the stokes parameters ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) are dimensionless , e.g. @xmath12 averaged over polarization states .",

    "the spin - harmonic expansion becomes a fourier expansion with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the azimuthal angle of the fouier wavevector @xmath22 .",
    "note that the @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes are then simply the @xmath9 and @xmath10 states in the coordinate system defined by @xmath22 @xcite , i.e. @xmath24-modes have a polarization orientation at @xmath25 to the wavevector .",
    "this decomposition is analogous to the vector field case where the divergence - free and curl - free portions are distinguished by the orientation of the velocity vector with respect to the wavevector .",

    "the universe is _ flat _ ( no spatial curvature ) if the total density is equal to the critical density , @xmath35 g @xmath36 ; it is _ open _ ( negative curvature ) if the density is less than this and _ closed _ ( positive curvature ) if greater .",

    ". we will be interested in the baryonic component @xmath45 and the total non - relativistic matter @xmath46 , where the difference is made up of cold dark matter .",
    "we also allow for a dark energy component @xmath47 , with an equation of state parameter @xmath48 which for illustrative purposes we often take to be a cosmological constant ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) as consistent with indications from distant supernovae @xcite .",
    "we represent the total density as @xmath51 so that deviations from unity represent a spatially curved universe .",
    "= 5.0 in      as the cmb cools due to the expansion , the photons eventually no longer have sufficient energy to overcome the binding energy of hydrogen @xmath52ev to keep the medium ionized .",
    "after this epoch , cmb photons propagate essentially unimpeded to the observer .",
    "this transition , called recombination , occurs relatively rapidly around @xmath53 at an energy scale of @xmath54 ev as can be seen by the equilibrium saha equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ionization fraction of hydrogen and we have neglected a small contribution from helium .",
    "the low @xmath57 of the transition is mainly due to the low baryon - photon ratio of the universe .",
    "it is sufficient that photons in the tail of the blackbody distribution be energetic enough to ionize hydrogen . in reality , recombination is slightly less rapid than implied by the saha equation since processes which account for net recombination are not sufficiently rapid to maintain equilibrium toward the end of recombination @xcite ( see @xcite for refinements ) . nonetheless the transition is sufficiently rapid that the photons in the cmb originate from a sharply defined surface or photosphere called the last scattering surface .",
    "the properties of the plasma on this surface directly translate into the observable primary temperature and polarization anisotropy in the cmb .",
    "these properties are themselves governed by thomson scattering of photons off of free electrons , which has a differential cross section of @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the thomson cross section , @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the incoming and outgoing directions of the electric field or polarization vector . summed over polarization and incoming angle , the comoving mean free path of a photon in the electrons is @xmath62 which is relatively small by cosmological standards .",

    "electrons are coupled to baryons by coulomb interactions and so on scales larger than @xmath63 , the photon - baryon plasma can be considered a nearly perfect fluid @xcite . in particular",
    ", rapid scattering keeps the photons isotropic in the baryon rest frame and so sets its dipole moment equal to the baryon velocity .",
    "the tight coupling approximation implies that the cmb is described by relatively few quantities .",
    "there is the local temperature , or monopole , in space @xmath64 , the dipole @xmath65 and a residual but important quadrupole moment @xmath66 from the breakdown of tight coupling .",
    "in addition , the photons experience a gravitational redshift from gravitational potentials and gravitational waves .",
    "modern cmb codes @xcite track the evolution of these sources @xcite and construct the present day cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy spectrum by geometric projection .    as a simple example , let us consider the spatial temperature perturbation @xmath67 , where the normalization convention reflects that of @xmath68 , on a last scattering surface considered to be infinitely sharp at a comoving distance @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bessel ] ) . in a flat universe , the spatial field",
    "may be represented by its fourier harmonics @xmath70 in an spatially curved universe , the plane waves must be replaced by the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator to account for a change in the relationship between distance and angle that we discuss below .",
    "also to achieve high precision in the predictions , the delta function must be replaced by the visibility function @xmath71 , the probability of a photon last scattering in a distance interval @xmath72 to account for the finite duration of recombination .",
    "expanding the plane waves in spherical harmonics , we obtain @xmath73 the power spectrum of the anisotropy contributions from the local temperature is then governed by that of the spatial temperature field at recombination @xmath74 such that @xmath75 note that the quantity @xmath76 is the contribution per log interval to the variance of the temperature @xmath77 . for a slowly - varying log power ,",
    "the integral in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : clpower ] ) can be performed analytically @xmath78 and so it is convenient to represent the anisotropy by the rms temperature contribution per log interval @xmath79 .",
    "it is also the contribution to the anisotropy variance per log interval in @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "we also define the analogous quantities to describe the polarization fields ( @xmath82 ) and the temperature - polarization cross correlations ( @xmath83 ) .    this behavior of the local temperature is representative of the other sources with a few important differences . in general ,",

    "( [ eqn : monopower ] ) one takes @xmath88 with features in one preserved in the other .",
    "this corresponds to an edge - on ( @xmath89 ) projection of the wavelength of the fluctuation onto angle : @xmath90 .",
    "other sources of anisotropy have angular dependence on the last scattering surface which changes the relationship between @xmath80 and @xmath91 .",
    "the dipole term provides an instructive example .",
    "it represents doppler shifts in the temperature due to the motion of the photon - baryon plasma along the line of sight . for a curl free flow",
    "as expected cosmologically , there is no contribution to the doppler effect for @xmath89 and the peak structure is washed out .",
    "mathematically , the doppler effect contributes a dipole term @xmath92 which when coupled to the plane wave angular momentum @xmath68 leads to a recoupling of @xmath93 to @xmath94 ( see fig .",

    ", @xmath94 has no peak structure leading to a one - to - many projection of @xmath91 onto @xmath80 .",
    "geometrically , well - defined features such as peaks in the anisotropy spectrum can not come from the doppler effect @xcite .",
    "all sources may be described in this framework of the addition of local angular momentum with plane wave orbital angular momentum with the net effect of modifying the mapping between @xmath91 and @xmath80 space @xcite .",
    "the local quadrupole plays a special role in that it is the fundamental source of linear polarization in the cmb as can be seen from the thomson differential cross section of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : thomson ] ) .",
    "heuristically , incoming radiation shakes an electron in the direction of its electric field vector @xmath96 causing it to radiate with an outgoing polarization parallel to that direction .",
    "however since the outgoing polarization @xmath97 must be orthogonal to the outgoing direction , incoming radiation that is polarized parallel to the outgoing direction can not scatter , leaving only one polarization state .",
    "if the intensity were completely isotropic the missing polarization state is supplied by radiation incoming from the direction orthogonal to the original one .",
    "only a quadrupole temperature anisotropy in the radiation generates a net linear polarization from thomson scattering . in particular",
    ", the polarization is oriented along the cold axis of the quadrupole moment in the transverse plane .",
    "we shall see that the breakdown of tight coupling during recombination allows quadrupoles to be generated out of gradients in the fluid velocity and from gravitational redshifts associated with gravitational waves . for the former ,",
    "since the quadrupole axis is aligned with the wavevector , the polarization generated is a pure @xmath23-mode ( see fig .  [",

    "gravitational waves generate both @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes @xcite .    to understand the phenomenology of the anisotropy in the cmb temperature and polarization fields it is sufficient to understand the dynamics governing the local sources : the monopole , dipole and quadrupole of the cmb temperature field and their gravitational or metric fluctuation analogues .",
    "the evolution of the anisotropy sources is governed by simple fluid dynamics . from the previous section ,",

    "covariant conservation of energy and momentum requires that the photons and baryons satisfy separate continuity equations @xmath110 and coupled euler equations @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the photon - baryon momentum density ratio .",

    "polarization is generally small , at most @xmath13210% of the anisotropy itself , since it requires scattering for its generation but its quadrupole source is suppressed if the scattering is too rapid . given the initial conditions and gravitational potentials , these equations predict the phenomenology of the acoustic oscillations in the temperature and polarization fields .",
    "the simplest inflationary models make a set of definite predictions for the initial conditions of the acoustic oscillations and hence their successful observation provides strong support for the inflationary paradigm .",

    "quantum fluctuations in the gravitational wave degrees of freedom also produce a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations whose power depends on @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the energy scale of inflation @xcite .",
    "a newtonian gravitational potential @xmath137 necessarily imparts an initial temperature perturbation since @xmath107 represents a spatially varying time - time perturbation to the metric away from coordinates where the temperature is homogeneous .",
    "the perturbation is equivalent to a change in the scale factor since @xmath138 which then produces a change in the temperature perturbation from the cosmological redshift @xmath43 of @xmath139 or @xmath140 in the radiation dominated era @xcite .",

    "there are three important aspects of these results .",
    "first , inflation sets the _",
    "temporal _ phase of all wavemodes by starting them all at the initial epoch .",
    "we shall see that this predicts a coherent set of peaks in the cmb spectrum with a definite phase .",
    "cosmological defect models predict a more random distribution of acoustic phases which produces incoherent acoustic phenomena @xcite .",
    "defects can be now be ruled out as a primary mechanism for structure formation in the universe .",
    "more generally , without inflation or some other modification to the matter - radiation dominated universe , curvature perturbations can not be generated outside the apparent horizon and so build up only by the causal motion of matter .",
    "this generally entails at least a delay in temporal phase of the oscillations which is not observed .",
    "secondly , since the power spectrum of the effective temperature is directly related to scale - invariant curvature fluctuations from inflation , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : monopower ] ) implies the acoustic oscillations should also be approximately scale invariant in amplitude in the tight coupling regime .",
    "observations are in excellent agreement with this fundamental prediction with tight constraints on the index @xmath143 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we will therefore base the discussion of the acoustic phenomenology on models with nearly scale - invariant initial curvature fluctuations as predicted by inflation .",
    "finally , the scale - invariant gravitational wave background leads to a quadrupolar distortion in the cmb temperature field just like its effect on a ring of test masses .",
    "because the quadrupole axes lie in the plane transverse to the wavevector , this quadrupole anisotropy leads to @xmath24-mode polarization as the tight coupling approximation breaks down .",
    "a measurement of @xmath24-modes from gravitational waves would determine the energy scale of inflation @xmath136 but its strong scaling with @xmath136 implies that it can only open a relatively small window between a few @xmath144 ",

    "it is instructive to first consider a simplified model where the universe is always matter - dominated in its expansion and the dynamical effects of the baryons are negligible .",

    "again under the assumption of a matter - dominated universe , the solution is that of a simple harmonic oscillator in a constant gravitational field but with an increased mass term @xmath188(k,\\eta _ * ) & = [ \\theta+(1+r)\\psi](k,0)\\cos(ks)\\nonumber\\\\ & = [ 1 + 3r]{1\\over 3}\\psi(0 ) \\cos(ks ) - r\\psi(0)\\ , , \\label{eqn : baryonoscillations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sound speed entering into the sound horizon calculation is reduced since @xmath189 . aside from this reduction , baryons have two distinguishing effects : they enhance the amplitude of the oscillations by @xmath190 fractionally and shift the zero point of the oscillation by @xmath191 . the latter modulates the amplitude of neighboring peaks : odd numbered peaks",
    "will be enhanced over the zero - baryon case by @xmath192 ; even numbered peaks remain the same ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : osc ] , right ) .",
    "physically , the baryon mass enhances compression inside gravitational potential wells .",
    "these qualitative results remain true in the presence of the real time - variable @xmath187 .",
    "measurement of these baryonic signatures currently limits @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "this value is strikingly consistent with inferences of the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "consequently there have been no significant changes in the baryon - photon ratio from an energy scale of an mev to an ev in the expansion history of the universe .",
    "= 4.5 in       [ sec : driving ]    the matter - to - radiation ratio scales as @xmath194 and so the universe is only barely matter - dominated at last scattering .",
    "moreover fluctuations corresponding to the higher peaks entered the sound horizon at an earlier time , during radiation domination . as we have seen , including the radiation changes the expansion rate of the universe and hence the physical scale of the sound horizon at recombination . fortunately , radiation has the more unique effect of driving the acoustic oscillations by making the gravitational force evolve with time @xcite .",
    "the exact evolution of the potentials is determined by the relativistic poisson equation .",
    "its qualitative content is clear : since the background density is decreasing with time , the density fluctuations must grow unimpeded by pressure to maintain constant potentials . in particular , in the radiation dominated era once pressure begins to fight gravity at the first compressional extrema of the oscillation ,",
    "the newtonian gravitational potential and spatial curvature must decay .",
    "this decay actually drives the oscillations : it is timed to leave the fluid maximally compressed with no gravitational potential to fight as it turns around .",
    "the net effect is doubled since the redshifting from the spatial metric fluctuation @xmath108 also goes away at the same time .",
    "when the universe becomes matter dominated the gravitational potential is no longer determined by photon - baryon density perturbations but by the pressureless dark matter .",
    "therefore , the amplitudes of the acoustic peaks increase as the matter - to - radiation ratio decreases @xcite .",
    "the net result is that across the horizon scale at matter - radiation equality the acoustic amplitude increases by a factor of @xmath195 for a pure photon and dark matter universe , and a factor of 4 when including the effect of neutrinos and baryons @xcite ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] ) . by eliminating gravitational potentials",
    ", radiation also eliminates the alternating peak heights from baryon loading ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cl ] ) .",
    "the observed high third peak ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : data ] ) is a good indication that matter dominates the energy density at recombination .",
    "finally , the effect of the decaying potential after recombination leads to so - called integrated sachs wolfe contributions to the temperature fluctuations through the continuity equation ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) and shifts the first acoustic peak downwards off of the acoustic series @xcite .",
    "observations of these matter - radiation phenomena ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cl ] ) currently constrain the total matter density to be @xmath196 @xcite and are crucial in internally resolving ambiguities in the interpretation of the peak scale .",
    "since this number greatly exceeds the measured baryon density , these observations are also the first empirical indication that the dark matter exists at high redshift .",
    "= 3.5 in       [ sec : damping ]    the photon - baryon fluid has slight imperfections corresponding to shear viscosity @xmath197 and heat conduction @xmath198 in the euler equation ( [ eqn : euler ] ) @xcite .",
    "these imperfections damp acoustic oscillations .",
    "these are both associated with the diffusion of the photons which is especially important during recombination when the mean free path of the photons rises dramatically . as we have seen the viscosity @xmath199 .",
    "with the continuity equation @xmath200 , this leads to a @xmath201 damping term in the oscillator equation .",
    "the heat conduction term can be shown to have a similar effect by expanding the euler equations in @xmath202 .",
    "an examination of the resulting damped oscillator equation shows that diffusion suppresses the oscillation amplitude by a factor of order @xmath203 .",
    "the damping scale @xmath204 is thus of order @xmath205 , corresponding to the geometric mean of the horizon and the mean free path .",
    "detailed numerical integration of the equations of motion are required to track the rapid growth of the mean free path and damping length through recombination itself .",
    "these calculations show that the damping scale is of order @xmath206 leading to a substantial suppression of the oscillations beyond the third peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "observations of the damping phenomena provide a check on the fundamental assumptions underlying the interpretation of the acoustic peaks . with @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the acoustic scale @xmath175 fixed by the first few peaks , the damping scale",
    "is uniquely predicted given the atomic physics of recombination .",
    "any change in recombination , for example due to a variation in the fine structure constant , will be revealed as a discrepancy in the predictions .",
    "likewise , any misinterpretation of @xmath175 due to say initial conditions that were not purely curvature fluctuations resulting in a phase shift in the peaks would also show up as a discrepancy .",
    "the data in the damping tail to date are beautifully consistent with the predictions of the model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) .",
    "the dissipation of the acoustic oscillations leaves a signature in the polarization of the cmb in its wake .",
    "recall that the observed polarization is a projection of the local quadrupole temperature anisotropy at last scattering .",
    "the fact that the polarization source is the quadrupole explains the shape and height of the polarization spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] . since the quadrupole is of order @xmath207 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : pitc ] ) , the polarization spectrum rises as @xmath208 to peak at the damping scale with an amplitude of about 10% of the temperature fluctuations before falling due to the elimination of the acoustic source itself due to damping . since @xmath209 is out of phase with the temperature ,",
    "the polarization peaks are also out of phase with the temperature peaks .",
    "furthermore , the phase relation also tells us that the polarization is correlated with the temperature perturbations .",
    "the correlation power @xmath210 being the product of the two , exhibits oscillations at twice the acoustic frequency . as in the case of the damping ,",
    "the predicting the precise value requires numerical work @xcite since @xmath211 changes so rapidly near recombination . nonetheless the detailed predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] bear these qualitative features .",
    "the acoustic polarization and cross correlation has recently been detected by the dasi experiment @xcite . like the damping scale ,",
    "the acoustic polarization spectrum is uniquely predicted from the temperature spectrum once @xmath45 , @xmath46 are specified .",
    "polarization thus represents a sharp test on the assumptions of the recombination physics and power law curvature fluctuations in the initial conditions used in interpreting the temperature peaks .",
    "these acoustic peaks in the polarization appear exclusively in the @xmath212 power spectrum due to the azimuthal symmetry of the plane wave fluctuations . during the break down of tight coupling that occurs at last scattering ,",
    "any gravitational waves present will also imprint a local quadrupole anisotropy to the photons and hence a linear polarization to the cmb @xcite .",
    "these contribute to the @xmath213 power and their detection would provide invaluable information on the origin of the fluctuations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , in simple inflationary models their amplitude gives the energy scale of inflation .",
    "the gravitational wave amplitude @xmath214 oscillates and decays once inside the horizon , so the associated polarization source scales as @xmath215 and so peaks at the @xmath216 horizon scale and not the damping scale at recombination ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) .",
    "this provides a useful scale separation of the various polarization effects .",
    "as the photons travel from the last scattering surface to the observer , they traverse the large - scale structure of the universe leaving subtle imprints in the temperature and polarization fields .",
    "there are two main gravitational effects .",
    "intervening mass along the line of sight gravitationally lenses the cmb photon trajectories @xcite and hence distorts both the temperature and polarization anisotropy fields .",
    "the photons are deflected according to the angular gradient of the potential projected along the line of sight , @xmath217 because surface brightness is conserved in lensing , the deflection simply remaps the observed fields as @xmath218 where @xmath219 , @xmath9 , @xmath220 .",
    "the typical deflection angle is of order a few arcminutes but the lines of sight are coherently deflected across scales of a few degrees . since the coherence scale of the acoustic features is larger than the deflection angle , the lensing effect can be calculated by taylor expanding eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : remap ] ) ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the result is a product of fields so that in harmonic space the modes are coupled to each other across a range @xmath221 set by the coherence of the deflection .",
    "heuristically , lensing distorts the hot and cold spots formed by the acoustic oscillations and hence the mapping of @xmath91 to @xmath80 .    in the temperature power spectrum , this mode coupling smooths the acoustic peaks slightly @xcite . for the polarization ,",
    "the remapping not only smooths the @xmath212-peaks but actually generates @xmath24-mode polarization @xcite .",
    "remapping by the lenses preserves the orientation of the polarization but warps its spatial distribution and hence does not preserve the symmetry of the original @xmath23-mode .",
    "gravitational lensing represents a fundamental obstacle to detection of low amplitude gravitational waves from inflation .    because the lensed cmb distribution is not linear in the fluctuations , higher order statistics are promising probes of lensing effects @xcite .",
    "in particular , the coupling of multipoles separated by @xmath222 can be used to construct a minimum variance estimator of the deflection potential @xmath223 out of pairs of moments @xcite .",
    "these quadratic estimators are close in performance to the optimal but more complicated maximum likelihood estimator @xcite . since",
    "small - scale polarization anisotropy is otherwise free of cosmological @xmath24-modes , most of the signal - to - noise in the reconstruction lies in the pairing of @xmath23-modes to neighboring lensing - generated @xmath24-modes @xcite .",
    "this correlation can in principle be used to map the deflection potential down to the @xmath224 scale .",
    "this mapping can in turn be used to measure the growth of structure from @xmath225 @xcite and hence the properties of the dark matter , including any component from massive neutrinos .",
    "it can also be used to remove much of the contamination to the gravitational wave @xmath24-modes and bring the detection threshold for the energy scale of inflation down to a @xmath226 gev @xcite .",
    "gravitational potentials can also change the temperature anisotropy through gravitational redshifts .",
    "density perturbations cease to grow once the dark energy dominates the expansion .",
    "as in the case of the matter - radiation transition , the gravitational potentials must then decay .",
    "the evolution of the gravitational potential under a smooth component of dark energy is given by @xmath227 \\frac{d \\phi}{d \\ln a }   + \\frac{3}{2}[1-w_e(a)]\\omega_{e}(a ) \\phi = 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : decay}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the appropriate replacements , this equation also applies to smooth components of dark matter , e.g. a light neutrino .",
    "a scalar field candidate for dark energy is smooth out to the horizon scale at any given time @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , a decay in the gravitational potential causes an effective heating of the photons in a gravitational well .",
    "like the matter - radiation analogue , it is intrinsically a large effect since the net change due to the decay is @xmath228 times the sachs - wolfe effect of @xmath229 .",
    "however since the opposite effect occurs in underdense regions , the contributions are canceled as photons traverse many crests and troughs of the potential perturbation during the matter - dark energy transition .",
    "the effect , called the ( late - time ) integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite , then appears only at large scales or low multipoles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "the isw effect is the most direct signature of the dark energy available in the cmb and is very sensitive to its equation of state and clustering properties if it deviates far from a cosmological constant ( @xmath230 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] ) , unfortunately given the large - scale nature of the effect , the limited number of samples of the low order multipoles , or `` cosmic variance '' , prevents a precise determination from the power spectrum .",
    "a promising technique is to isolate the isw effect through its cross correlation with reconstructed lensing maps from the cmb @xcite .",
    "the universe is observed to be ionized out to @xmath231 and is thought to have undergone reionization sometime between between @xmath232 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "consequently a minimum of a few percent of the photons have rescattered since recombination ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mfp ] ) .",
    "the main effect from rescattering of the photons during reionization is a uniform suppression of the peaks by @xmath233 as anisotropy is destroyed by the randomization of directions in scattering . since this can be confused with a change in the initial amplitude of fluctuations , it is important to resolve this ambiguity for the study of initial fluctuations and the growth rate of fluctuations , which itself probes the properties of the dark energy and dark matter through eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : decay ] ) .",
    "reionization is interesting in its own right since it can us about the sources of ionizing radiation from the first astrophysical objects formed in the universe .",
    "the most promising means of isolating the reionization effect through the cmb is from the generation of large scale polarization during recombination .",
    "the rescattered radiation becomes polarized since temperature inhomogeneities become anisotropies by projection ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : monopoleproj ] ) , passing through quadrupole anisotropy when the perturbations are on the horizon scale at any given time ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "the result is a peak in the @xmath23-mode power spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] . in a perfect , foreground - free world",
    ", even the minimal signal is within reach of the map @xcite and planck @xcite satellites and can be used to isolate the reionization epoch @xcite .",
    "the dissipation of the acoustic oscillations at small scales also provides a window through which to see subtler effects .",
    "the main contribution beyond the damping tail comes from the rescattering of the cmb off of hot electrons in clusters of galaxies , called the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "inverse compton scattering represents a net transfer of energy between the hot electron gas and the cooler cmb .",
    "it leaves a spectral distortion in the cmb where photons on the rayleigh - jeans side are transferred to the wien tail .",
    "the effect in individual clusters is now routinely measured and is an important means of studying the physics of clusters and the dark energy @xcite .",
    "the effect of unresolved high redshift clusters may have already been detected in the cmb by the cbi and bima experiments , albeit at an amplitude that is somewhat higher than expected @xcite .",
    "confirmation of the nature of this small scale excess will require measurements at multiple frequencies to test its inverse compton nature .",
    "there are a host of smaller effects due to doppler shifts of the moving ionized gas ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these present a significant challenge to detect and interpret and are beyond the scope of this review .",
    "the tremendous experimental progress in cmb anisotropy studies over the last few years has helped establish a standard paradigm for cosmology at intermediate epochs but has simultaneously raised questions about the physics at the two opposite ends of time .",
    "simple inflationary models of the early universe have so far passed the test of the acoustic peaks .",
    "they predict the near scale - invariant initial curvature fluctuations in a spatially flat background that have now been observed .",
    "moreover , spatial flatness appears to be maintained today by a mysterious form of missing or dark energy .",
    "the first step into the future will come with the release of data from the map satellite in early 2003 which in the full course of the mission will provide the definitive measurement of temperature anisotropy across the whole sky down to a quarter of a degree .",
    "the map satellite will test the spectrum of initial conditions beyond the simple constraints on the power law index which can be extracted today ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these advances will come with the increased precision in the temperature measurements and determination of the acoustic peaks in the polarization and cross correlation .",
    "measurement of the polarization peaks will not only eventually double the amount of statistical information that can be extracted from the cmb but can also provide a sharp distinction between small changes in the dynamics of the plasma , which affect temperature and polarization differently , and small deviations from scale invariance of in the initial conditions ( e.g. @xcite ) , which affect the two alike . studies of the gaussianity of the acoustic fluctuations will also provide a strong test of the inflationary model .",
    "the increased precision on the matter - radiation ratio will sharpen considerably the constraints on the dark energy .",
    "map should also be able to detect or place limits on the amount of reionization in the universe through a large angle bump in the polarization and hence remove a central ambiguity for dark energy and dark matter studies from the peaks .",
    "the next generation of experiments dedicated to fine - scale , secondary structure in the anisotropy will enable new tests of the dark energy from structures in the universe such as galaxy clusters .",
    "they will also provide a new handle on reionization through the doppler shift of cmb photons off of moving structures .    further down the road",
    "lies the milestone of the gravitational lensing of the peaks .",
    "detection will not only require more sensitive instruments and higher angular resolution but also subtraction of galactic and extragalactic foreground contaminants @xcite . in principle",
    "higher order statistics can be used to reconstruct the potential field in projection with a large gains in sensitivity available if the @xmath24-modes from lensing can not only be detected but accurately mapped @xcite . from this reconstruction the dark matter and dark energy dependent growth of structure can be measured .",
    "for example gravitational lensing can enable tests of the scalar - field hypothesis for the nature of the dark energy through cross - correlation with the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .    the ultimate future milestone for",
    "the cmb is the detection of gravitational waves from inflation through @xmath24-mode polarization .",
    "detection would represent strong evidence for the inflationary model and pin down its energy scale .",
    "the window of detectability can be extended to energy scales above a few @xmath144 gev but only if the @xmath24-modes from gravitational lensing are removed from a direct reconstruction .",
    "these future milestones will require much experimental effort to achieve and much theoretical effort to interpret .",
    "nevertheless they provide the hope that the next decade of studies of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy will be as fruitful as the last ."
