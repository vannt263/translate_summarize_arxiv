    "one such work is of avila - last - simon @xcite where they showed quasi - clock behaviour for ergodic jacobi operator in region of absolutely continuous spectrum . in @xcite",
    "krichevski - valk - viag showed the sine-@xmath17 process for @xmath16 .",
    "similar work in continuous analogue are done by kotani @xcite where gap between eigenvalue was studied and limit laws is obtained for @xmath15 .",
    "kotani - nakano@xcite and nakano@xcite showed that the statistics for @xmath15 is clock and for @xmath16 it is circular @xmath17-ensemble .",
