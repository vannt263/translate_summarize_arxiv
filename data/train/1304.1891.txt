    "the forward slope of the differential cross sections for elastic and quasi - elastic reactions , e.g. deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) or vector meson production ( vmp ) , is known to be related to the masses / virtualities of the interacting particles .",
    "this phenomenon is clearly seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : slope ] , where the forward slope @xmath2 is plotted against the variable @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath4 are respectively the square of the virtuality and of the mass of the produced particle and the notation is evident from fig .  [",

    "[ fig : fig1](c )",
    ". thus , in this  geometrical \" picture , the largest slope ( radius ) is expected for a real compton scattering , where @xmath7 . in the present paper",
    "we consider exclusive electroproduction of real photons ( dvcs ) and vector mesons ( vmp ) making use of the above geometrical considerations , by writing the scattering amplitude in the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 this approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the simpler case of photoproduction ( @xmath10 )",
    ".        the off - mass shell continuation of the @xmath11-matrix , or , in particular , the introduction of any dependence of the regge - pole amplitude on the virtuality , @xmath0 and masses of external particles remains an open problem for the theory .",
    "empirically , it was approached in various models , of which the best known is the introduction of @xmath0-dependent parameters in the regge ( e.g. the pomeron ) trajectories , namely , the intercept @xmath12 and the slope @xmath13 . since , by definition ( i.e. by regge - factorization )",
    ", the trajectory should not depend on the properties ( masses and virtualities ) of the external particles , such regge poles and trajectories are called  effective \" ones .",
    "it is the relevant vertex function that bears information about the masses and virtualities of the particles coupled to them . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple model for dvcs and vmp , based on the use of a new variable defined as @xmath14 was put forward .    in the view of the limitations of that model",
    "as discussed in @xcite , below we scrutinize an alternative approach @xcite by combining the regge pole model with geometrical ideas , resulting in reggeometry=(regge+geometry ) . in the nearly forward direction , where the cross sections decrease almost exponentially , @xmath15 ,",
    "the slope @xmath16 is related to the interaction radius , which is a function of the inverse mass ( virtuality ) of the particles , @xmath17 reflecting the geometrical nature of the slope , proportional to the  interaction radius \" , or to the inverse squared masses .",

    "there are however several caveats in this simple and appealing interpretation of the slope , namely :    * the relation @xmath19 is model - dependent ; an alternative relation , e.g. @xmath20 being a parameter to be determined by fits to experimental data , is equally legitimate .",
    "another degree of freedom enters putting the factor @xmath21 as denominator in the expression of @xmath6 , i.e. writing @xmath22 ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "empirically , the slope can be given by the relation @xmath23 .",
    "it includes an exponent @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , whose value is not necessarily an integer and may even depend on @xmath6 ( see , for instance , see fig . 10.26 and eqs .",

    "* relation ( [ geometry ] ) was established only within certain classes of reactions , notably vmp , @xmath26 it remains an open question if it is also applicable to dvcs , and , moreover , to purely hadronic reactions .",
    "studies of all these options involve also @xmath27 and @xmath28 dependences of the relevant scattering amplitude .",
    "we use simple models of @xmath29 and @xmath30dependences to concentrate on the less trivial @xmath31 dependence .",
    "our model is based on two pillars : the  reggeometric \" form of the amplitude , introduced in the introduction , and its two - component nature .",
    "the latter implies that the unique pomeron has two components - a  soft \" and a  hard \" one , and that their relative weight varies with @xmath6 , thus providing a unify description of both soft and hard collisions .",
    "the model was presented at the 2011 eds conference in quy nhon @xcite and at the diffraction 2013 conference at the canarias @xcite . anticipating a global fit ( with a universal set of the free parameters ) , to appear @xcite , here we make the first important step by fitting the hera data on several particular processes , one by one , to a single reggeometric term .",
    "this one - component effective model is fitted , to the hera data on dvcs and vmp .",

    "according to the arguments presented in the introduction and in @xcite , the dvcs or vmp amplitudes of the reggeometric model with a single pomeron term can be written as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a normalization factor , @xmath34 is a scale for the virtuality , @xmath24 is a free parameter with @xmath25 , @xmath35 is the signature factor , @xmath36 is a scale for the squared energy and @xmath37 is the pomeron trajectory .",

    "we obtain the forward slope : @xmath50 then the elastic cross section is obtained by integrating the differential cross section .",
    "the result , in the case of linear regge trajectory , is @xmath51 and due to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dcsdt ] ) and ( [ eq : bslope ] ) it reads @xmath52",
    "as already mentioned in introduction , in this paper we consider a simple model with a single term for the pomeron ,  soft \" or  hard \" - depending on the kinematic region and class of reaction we present a possible alternative , empirical model with @xmath6-dependent effective \" trajectories , mimicking the transition between soft and hard dynamics . this model has been presented to the workshop `` diffraction 2012 ''  @xcite . ] .",
    "the expressionsfor the cross - sections and the slope are given by eqs .",

    "for simplicity we set @xmath55 gev@xmath56 , so seven free parameters remain : the normalization factor @xmath33 ; the scale @xmath34 for the virtuality ; the exponent @xmath24 for @xmath57dependent factor in the amplitude ; the intercept @xmath53 and the slope @xmath54 of the linear pomeron trajectory ; the two coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which set the @xmath57dependence for the forward slope .",
