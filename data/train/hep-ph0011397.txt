    "the hope is to produce a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "this plasma is , however , rather ephemeral and soon hadronizes into a cornucopia of mesons and baryons .",
    "one thus needs an indirect means of deducing as to whether or not the plasma was produced in the history of a given collision .",
    "various experimental signatures have been proposed to this effect : j@xmath0 suppression @xcite , strangeness enhancement @xcite , dilepton spectra @xcite etc . in this paper",
    "we calculate a new contribution to the spectrum of dileptons ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) emanating from a quark gluon plasma .",
    "early calculations of the dilepton radiation in the deconfined sector were concerned with the process @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a recent calculation has estimated the effects of chemical non - equilibrium and of a large gluon excess on dilepton spectra @xcite . there , a fugacity was introduced to account for chemical non - equilibrium .",
    "the function of this fugacity is essentially to change the gluon and quark numbers from their equilibrium values .",
    "possible sources of dileptons , such as @xmath3 annihilation , @xmath4 compton scattering , and @xmath5 fusion had been investigated and at chemical and thermal equilibrium the spectrum was found to be dominated by @xmath2 , followed by @xmath6 which is an order of magnitude lower , followed by @xmath7 which is lower than the first process by 3 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the aim of our work is to propose that , when there is an asymmetry in the populations of quarks and antiquarks ( i.e. , a finite baryon chemical potential ) a new set of diagrams actually arise . using these we calculate a new contribution to the 3-loop photon self - energy .",
    "the various cuts of this self - energy contain higher loop contributions to the usual processes of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and an entirely new process : @xmath11 .",
    "we calculate the contribution of this new channel to the differential production rate of back - to - back dileptons .",
    "it is finally shown that within reasonable values of parameters this process may become larger than the differential rate from the standard tree level @xmath8 .",
    "imagine a scenario where the plasma is not just heated vacuum , but actually displays an asymmetry between quarks and antiquarks .",
    "this asymmetry would eventually manifest itself as an asymmetry between the baryon antibaryon populations in the final state . in plasma calculations",
    "this asymmetry may be achieved by the introduction of a quark chemical potential @xmath12 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will assume here that @xmath13 is the same for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 quarks ( we are assuming the plasma to contain three massless flavours ) .",
    "we also assume that the chemical potential for gluons is zero .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : section ii discusses a class of diagrams which are non - existent at zero temperature , and also at finite temperature and zero density .",

    "section iii focuses on a specific channel which will become a source of dileptons . in section",
