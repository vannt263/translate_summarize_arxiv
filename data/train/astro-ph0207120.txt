    "there is a growing body of evidence that galaxies form in a hierarchal manner , with low mass systems serving as the basic building blocks of galaxy formation . not only are hierarchal galaxy formation models able to reproduce a wide range of the observational properties of nearby galaxies ( e.g. somerville & primack 1999 ; cole et al .  2000 ) , but they also provide a natural explanation for extended stellar streams ( e.g. ibata et al . 2001 ; martinez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) and the overall structural properties of the galactic halo ( bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2001 ) .",
    "the merging process continues to the present day , and it has been suggested that the ultimate fate of the local group may be a merger that produces an elliptical galaxy ( forbes et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "studies of present - day dwarf galaxies can provide insights into the systems from which larger galaxies formed . for example , there are indications that the galactic halo could not have formed from the accretion of systems with chemical enrichment histories similar to those of the low mass dwarf spheroidal companions of the milky - way ( shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the chemical evolution of the present - day dwarf spheroidal companions of the milky - way has been affected by tidal interactions with the galaxy ( e.g. mayer et al . 2001 ) , with the result that these systems evolved differently from those that merged early - on to form the galactic halo .",
    "cdm - based simulations predict many more low - mass systems in the local group than have been detected ( e.g. kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) , and this provides a strong motivation to search for heretofore undiscovered dwarf galaxies .",
    "armandroff et al .  (",
    "1998 ) discuss such a search for low surface brightness companions of m31 , and report the detection of the dwarf galaxy and v. using a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) obtained from follow - up ccd images , armandroff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude that the metallicity and mean central surface brightness of and v are superficially unremarkable , in the sense that these quantities are similar to those of two other companions of m31 : and i and and iii .",
    "the apparent similarity to and i and and iii notwithstanding , with a mean abundance [ fe / h ] @xmath6 and absolute magnitude m@xmath7 , and v falls well off of the relation between metallicity and m@xmath8 that is otherwise well - defined by observational data ( e.g.  caldwell 1999 ) .",
    "the [ fe / h ] ",
    "m@xmath8 relation is generally thought to be imprinted during the early stages of galaxy evolution , and is a measure of the extent of chemical enrichment before the onset of winds that purge a galaxy of its interstellar medium .",
    "this relation is of fundamental astrophysical importance ; for example , it is likely the physical basis behind the color - magnitude relation of early - type galaxies ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) , and is a basic prediction of cdm - dominated galaxy formation models ( e.g.  dekel & silk 1986 , cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "why does and v depart from the [ fe / h ] ",
    "m@xmath8 relation ? a reasonable starting point for answering",
    "this question is to check the existing metallicity determination .",
    "the ccd data used by armandroff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to construct the cmd of and v were recorded during @xmath9 seeing conditions , and are restricted to the upper @xmath10 mag of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "their cmd shows a scatter of @xmath11 mag , and includes only a fraction of the stars in the galaxy .",
    "given the potential significance of and v , we decided to re - investigate the metallicity of this galaxy using ( 1 ) deep multi - color images recorded during sub - arcsec seeing conditions and ( 2 ) spectra of individual stars that include the near - infrared ca ii triplet , which is a metallicity indicator ( e.g.  armandroff & da costa 1991 ) . in the present paper we discuss the photometric measurements of stars in and v ; the spectroscopic observations will be discussed in a second paper ( da costa et al .  in preparation ) . based on the slope of the giant branch in the cmd",
    ", we find that [ fe / h ] @xmath12 , indicating that and v is more metal - poor than previously thought .",
    "the data were obtained at the gemini north telescope as part of the system verification program for the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) .",
    "detailed descriptions of gmos have been provided by crampton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and davies et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and so we restrict the present discussion to the gmos detector . the detector for gmos is a mosaic of three @xmath13 eev ccds , each pixel of which subtends @xmath14 on a side .",
    "a @xmath15 diameter field is imaged on the detector array , which is over - sized so that spectra of objects near the field edge can be obtained .",
    "the detector was binned @xmath16 at the telescope for these observations , so each supra - pixel subtends @xmath17 on a side .",
    "images of and v were recorded through @xmath0 , and @xmath1 filters ( fukugita et al .",
    "a series of nine exposures were obtained in each filter , and the telescope was offset between these to allow the gaps between the individual ccds to be filled in when constructing the final images . the total exposure times and fwhms of the and v data",
    "are listed in table 1 .",
    "the central regions of the globular clusters ngc 288 , ngc 2419 , and m2 ( ngc 7089 ) were also imaged in @xmath18 and @xmath1 to calibrate the metallicity dependence of @xmath19 ; @xmath20 images were also taken of ngc 2419 .",
    "the exposure times and fwhm of the cluster data are also listed in table 1 , while the metallicities of these clusters , as given in the current version ( june 1999 ) of the harris ( 1996 ) database , are listed in table 2 .",
    "the photometric calibration was defined using observations of 15 landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars that were obtained over 3 different nights during the october system verification observing run .",
    "the standard magnitudes were transformed into the @xmath21 system using the relations given in fukugita et al .",
    "mean atmospheric extinction coefficients for mauna kea were used , and the estimated uncertainties in the zeropoints are @xmath22 mag .",
    "conditions were photometric when the data discussed in this paper were recorded .",
    "the data were reduced using the processing pipeline developed for gmos and implemented in the gemini iraf package .",
    "the reduction steps are ( 1 ) bias subtraction , ( 2 ) flat - field correction , including the correction of ccd - to - ccd gain differences , ( 3 ) the construction of a mosaic from the individual ccd images , taking into account the spatial shifts and rotations between the detector elements , ( 4 ) the spatial registration of the mosaiced images , and ( 5 ) co - addition of the mosaiced images .",
    "the latter step takes into account offsets made at the telescope to fill in the gaps between the ccds , and also cleans the images of bad pixels and cosmic ray hits .",
    "the results were then trimmed to the area of common coverage , so that the exposure time was constant across the frame .",
    "the central portion of the final @xmath1 image , which contains the main body of and v , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "stellar brightnesses were measured with the psf - fitting program allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , with psfs and preliminary aperture measurements obtained from tasks in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) . completeness fractions and internal uncertainties in the and v measurements were estimated from artificial star experiments in which scaled versions of the psf , with brightnesses and colors tracing the locus of actual stars in the and v cmds , were added to the final images .",
    "photometric measurements of the artificial stars were made using the same procedures employed for real stars .",
    "the predicted completeness fractions and internal errors in the photometry in @xmath18 and @xmath1 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the data reduction process included shifting and rotating individual images , and this could potentially affect the photometry . to estimate the extent of any systematic effects introduced by this processing , stellar brightnesses were measured from a portion of a single bias - subtracted and flat - fielded @xmath1 image that included the center of and v , and the results were compared with the photometry from the final co - added @xmath1 image .",
    "the two sets of measurements are in excellent agreement when @xmath23 , which is where the difference in integration times has the least impact on the photometry .",
    "the mean difference in brightness for 25 stars having @xmath23 is 0.002 mag with a standard deviation of @xmath24 mag . for the 20 stars with @xmath1 between 21.0 and 21.5 , which is the top 0.5 mag of the and v rgb ,",
    "the difference is 0.010 mag with a standard deviation @xmath25 mag . after adjusting for the lower integration time of the single image ,",
    "the standard deviation is consistent with the photometric scatter predicted from the artificial star experiments .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the processing used to construct the final mosaiced co - added images has not affected the photometry .    and",
    "v is located at an intermediate galactic latitude , and there is significant contamination from field stars and background galaxies at the brightnesses corresponding to giants in this galaxy . given that and v is relatively compact and round ( caldwell 1999 ) , and that the fractional contamination from field objects depends on distance from the galaxy center , we decided to investigate the photometric properties of sources in 3 equal - area annuli centered on and v. the @xmath4 cmds of stars in these annuli are plotted in figure 3 ; the radial dimensions used to define each annulus are also listed in this figure .",
    "caldwell ( 1999 ) traced the light profile of and v out to a radius of @xmath26 .",
    "however , the and v giant branch can be detected even in the outermost annulus data plotted in figure 3 , indicating that and v extends to radii in excess of those explored by caldwell ( 1999 ) ; consequently , the integrated brightness of and v estimated by caldwell ( 1999 ) is likely a lower limit .    if mean metallicity and/or age varies in a systematic way with radius in and",
    "v then this will affect the location of the rgb in the cmds . to determine if there is evidence for a population gradient , we measured the mean @xmath19 color between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and found that @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the inner , middle , and outer annuli .",
    "the giant branch is not vertical , and annulus - to - annulus differences in the distribution of points along the @xmath1 axis could affect the means computed above .",
    "therefore , we also computed the mean of the quantity @xmath31 in each annulus for stars between @xmath32 and @xmath28 .",
    "a least squares fit to the inner annulus rgb indicates that the rgb slope at this brightness is @xmath33 , and we adopted this value to compute @xmath34 . we find that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in the inner , middle , and outer annuli . we conclude that the color of the giant branch does not change significantly with distance from the center of and v , and so there is no evidence for a population gradient .",
    "this is consistent with the results of other m31 dwarf spheroidals ( e.g.  da costa , armandroff , & caldwell 2002 ) . indeed , in no dwarf spheroidal system has any radial dependence of the rgb color been detected , with the possible exception of fornax ( saviane , held , & bertelli 2000 ) .",
    "the cluster cmds were corrected for reddening and distance using the @xmath38 color excesses and @xmath39 hb brightnesses listed in the current version ( june 1999 ) of harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "distances were based on the salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) hb calibration ; the reasons for adopting this particular calibration are discussed in  3.2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath40 cmds of the globular clusters are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "a crowded central field was intentionally imaged in each cluster in an effort to sample a significant number of bright giants for subsequent spectroscopic follow - up ; nevertheless , despite the relatively high stellar densities , the cmds are well - defined and extend below the main sequence turn - off .",
    "the scatter in the cmds indicate that the internal photometric accuracy is on the order of a few hundredths of a mag .",
    "the ngc 288 cmd is the best - defined , as the field observed for this cluster has the lowest stellar density , and hence is least affected by crowding .",
    "however , the giant branch of this cluster in figure 4 terminates @xmath41 mag fainter than that of the other 2 clusters .",
    "we note that the light profiles presented by trager , king , & djorgovski ( 1995 ) indicate that the central surface brightness of ngc 288 is roughly 5 mag / arcsec@xmath42 fainter in m@xmath8 than for the other two clusters .",
    "the correspondingly lower central stellar density then explains the lack of bright giants : the number of stars in the ngc 288 field is simply not high enough to permit stars on the uppermost regions of the rgb to be observed .      to facilitate comparisons between the and v and globular cluster giant branches ,",
    "normal points were computed from the @xmath43 cluster cmds . a recursive @xmath44 rejection scheme was used to suppress outliers .",
    "any direct comparison between and v and the globular cluster data must also adjust for differences in distance and reddening . while the globular cluster distances can be computed using the brightness of the hb ,",
    "the only standard candle currently available for and v is the rgb - tip , and the use of different standard candles when comparing the globular cluster and and v sequences is a potential source of systematic error .",
    "therefore , we adopted calibrations for the rgb - tip and hb that give consistent distance moduli .",
    "salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) investigate the rgb - tip and hb distance scales using calibrations based on stellar evolution models , and the results from that study can be used to establish consistent distance scales for and v and the globular clusters .",
    "an initial distance modulus to and v was computed using the armandroff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) @xmath45band rgb - tip measurement and equation 9 of salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) .",
    "we elected to use the armandroff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) rgb - tip measurement because it is in the same photometric system as the calibration .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the rgb - tip occurs at @xmath46 in our data , which corresponds roughly to @xmath47 ; hence , the rgb - tip brightness measured here is consistent with the armandroff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) value of @xmath48 .",
    "the rgb - tip calibration is mildly sensitive to metallicity , with m@xmath49 differing by 0.09 mag between [ fe / h ] = @xmath50 and @xmath51 . given this difference , we computed the distance modulus of and v using both [ fe / h ] @xmath52 and @xmath51 , and found that the comparisons in figure 5 , described below , are insensitive to the adopted metallicity .",
    "cluster distance moduli were calculated using the hb @xmath39 magnitudes listed in the current version of the harris ( 1996 ) database and equation 3 of salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) , with zahb corrections from equation 5 of cassisi & salaris ( 1997 ) .",
    "the rgb - tip and hb calibrations might be expected to give different distance moduli because of uncertainties in the models of stars approaching the core he flash and experiencing core he burning .",
    "in fact , salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) compared the distance moduli of seven galaxies computed using rgb - tip and hb measurements , and the data in their table 4 indicate that there is a @xmath53 mag offset , in the sense that the distance moduli computed with the hb tend to be lower . the entries for ngc 205 in table 4 of salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) were not included when computing this mean because the difference between the hb and rgb - tip distances for this galaxy is clearly discrepant . to bring the zeropoints of the rgb - tip and hb calibrations into agreement we subtracted 0.15 mag from the rgb - tip distance modulus of and v.    the standard candle brightness , reddening , and final distance modulus of and v and",
    "the clusters are listed in table 2 .",
    "the reddening for and v listed in table 2 is from burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , while @xmath54 values for the clusters are from the current version of the harris ( 1996 ) database .",
    "the reddening for and v listed in table 2 is not greatly different from that predicted by the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) extinction maps , which give @xmath55 for and v. @xmath56 was computed from @xmath54 using the entries listed in table 6 of schlegel et al .",
    "the distance scale is a matter of active debate , and we appreciate that other calibrations are available for the hb and rgb - tip ; however , we are confident that the distances in table 2 computed from the hb and rgb - tip are consistent , which is of fundamental importance for the comparisons described below .",
    "the globular cluster rgb sequences are compared with the and v inner annulus data in the top panel of figure 5 .",
    "it is reassuring that the rgb - tip brightnesses of and v , ngc 2419 , and m2 agree , confirming that the adopted rgb - tip and hb calibrations are consistent .",
    "a visual inspection of the top panel of figure 5 indicates that the and v data closely matches the rgb of ngc 2419 , although when m@xmath57 is between 2 and 3 there may be a tendency for the and v data to fall midway between the ngc 2419 and m2 sequences .",
    "this comparison suggests that the majority of stars in and v have a metallicity comparable to ngc 2419 , for which [ fe / h ] @xmath58 .",
    "uncertainties in the photometric calibration and the reddening complicate comparisons like those in the top panel of figure 5 .",
    "for example , if @xmath55 is adopted for and v , as predicted from the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) maps , then the and v sequence falls midway between the ngc 2419 and m2 giant branches .",
    "the shape of the upper rgb provides a means of estimating metallicity that is insensitive to uncertainties in the photometric calibration and reddening ( e.g. hartwick & sandage 1968 ; sarajedini 1994 ) , and so we use the slope of the upper giant branch to set constraints on the metallicity of and v. the giant branch of and v is steeper than that of m2 , and this is demonstated in the bottom panel of figure 5 , where the and v data from the top panel has been shifted by 0.07 mag along the color axis to force agreement with the m2 rgb when m@xmath59 . when compared in this manner , stars with m@xmath60 in and v fall to the left of the m2 sequence , even though the and v data matches the m2 giant branch when m@xmath59 .",
    "thus , the and v rgb is steeper than that of m2 , which is consistent with and v being more metal - poor than this cluster .    in an effort to compare the upper rgb slopes in a quantifiable manner , a least squares fit was made to the upper rgbs of and v , ngc 2419 , and m2 to determine @xmath61 , and the results",
    "are listed in table 3 .",
    "ngc 288 was not considered , as our observations do not sample the upper rgb of this cluster .",
    "the slopes listed in table 3 were measured from stars with m@xmath57 between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , although the results are insensitive to the magnitude interval over which the slopes are calculated ; for example , the conclusions do not change if slopes are measured using stars with m@xmath57 between 2 and 4 .",
    "obvious agb and field stars were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the @xmath61 values for ngc 2419 and m2 are significantly different , in the sense that the rgb of ngc 2419 is steeper than that of m2 .",
    "however , the entries for and v and ngc 2419 in table 3 agree within the estimated uncertainties . using observations of globular clusters spanning a range of metallicities , sarajedini ( 1994 ) found that @xmath64 , which is a measure of rgb slope based on the difference in @xmath39 between the hb and the rgb at @xmath65 , changes linearly with [ fe / h ] .",
    "if it is assumed that @xmath61 also changes in a linear manner with [ fe / h ] then we find that [ fe / h ] @xmath66 for and v. we adopt this as our ` best ' photometric metallicity estimate for and v.      the lfs of and v and ngc 2419 are compared in the upper panel of figure 6 .",
    "the and v lf was constructed using stars within 89 arcsec of the galaxy center , with tight limits being applied about the giant branch on the cmd to reduce field star contamination .",
    "the ngc 2419 lf in figure 6 , which was scaled along the vertical axis to match the number of stars in the and v lf when m@xmath67 , is in excellent agreement with the and v lf .",
    "the good agreement between the lfs of and v and ngc 2419 is not unexpected , given that the rate of evolution on the rgb does not change markedly with metallicity ( e.g.  vandenberg 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 lfs of ngc 288 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath68 ) and m2 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath69 ) , which are compared in the lower panel of figure 6 , are also very similar .",
    "we have also searched and v for bright agb stars , which are a signature of star formation during intermediate epochs .",
    "the dwarf spheroidal companions of the milky - way and m31 span a range of star - forming histories , with some containing uniformly old populations , while others contain populations that formed during intermediate epochs ( e.g.  mateo 1998 ; da costa et al .",
    "there are indications that the dwarf spheroidal systems of the milky - way and m31 may have evolved differently , since a significant fraction of the galactic dwarf spheroidals contain intermediate - age populations , while the only m31 dwarf spheroidal to show such a population is and ii ( da costa et al .",
    "the detection of an extended agb in and v would suggest that the m31 and milky - way systems may not be as different as currently appears to be the case .",
    "the ( @xmath70 ) cmds of systems with intermediate - age populations ( e.g.   figure 5 of richer , crabtree , & pritchet 1990 ) , suggest that if and v has an extended agb then it will likely have a peak @xmath1 brightness within @xmath71 mag of the rgb - tip , and extending @xmath72 mag in @xmath3 redward of the rgb - tip .",
    "the @xmath4 cmds of stars in and v near the rgb - tip in the three radial intervals defined in figure 3 are compared in figure 7 .",
    "foreground stars and background galaxies have magnitudes and colors that are similar to candidate agb stars , and objects were counted in 0.5 mag ( @xmath73 mag ( @xmath19 ) regions of each cmd to assess statistically this contamination ; if and v contains a suitably large population of bright agb stars then they will show up as an excess in the innermost annulus .",
    "the boxes used for the star counts , and the number of objects detected in each , are indicated in figure 7 .",
    "the mean number of stars in each box is 5.3 , with a standard deviation @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the 9 objects in the innermost annulus with @xmath1 between 20.5 and 21.0 , which is where an agb component might be expected , do not constitute a statistically significant excess population .",
    "this does not mean the and v lacks an intermediate - age population , but simply that it is not large enough to produce a statistically significant number of bright agb stars .",
    "spectra and near - infrared photometry will be useful to determine if any bright sources near the center of and v are main sequence foreground stars , giants at the distance of and v , or background objects .",
    "we note that since and v is very metal - poor , then agb - tip stars belonging to the galaxy may be carbon stars , which can be identified using narrow - band imaging techniques ( e.g.  richer , pritchet , & crabtree 1985 ; cook , aaronson , & norris 1986 ) .",
    "deep @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath1 images obtained with gmos on the gemini north telescope have been used to investigate the photometric properties of bright giants in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy and v. the data include stars that are three magnitudes in @xmath1 fainter than the rgb - tip , making the current paper the deepest photometric study of this galaxy to date .",
    "based on the slope of the upper rgb on the @xmath4 cmd , we conclude that and v has a metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath66 , which is significantly lower than was estimated by armandroff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . with the previous metallicity estimate of [ fe / h ] @xmath6 , and",
    "v had the largest deviation from the trend between [ fe / h ] and m@xmath8 among dwarf galaxies plotted in figure 4 of caldwell ( 1999 ) ; however , our revised metallicity places and v squarely on this relation .",
    "a number of factors , including environment , likely contribute scatter to the relation between m@xmath8 and [ fe / h ] , and studies such as ours provide data that will ultimately allow the intrinsic dispersion about the [ fe / h ] ",
    "m@xmath8 relation to be measured .",
    "our revised metallicity for and v tightens the relation between integrated brightness and metallicity for low mass systems , and one implication of such a tight relation is that the m / l ratio of dwarf systems must not differ by large amounts at a given m@xmath8 .",
    "the chemical contents of dwarf elliptical galaxies in the m81 group appear to be defined by total baryonic mass ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) , rather than other properties such as the central stellar concentration , possibly suggesting that the [ fe / h ] ",
    "m@xmath8 relation has its origins in global galaxy properties .",
    "a caveat is that the structural properties of low mass galaxies in hierarchal systems may change with time ; for example , tidal effects may alter the structural properties of dwarf systems ( e.g.  cuddeford & miller 1990 , mayer et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "there is an hi cloud close to and v on the sky but , with @xmath75 km / sec ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ) , the cloud has a velocity that is very different from that of and v , for which evans et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measure @xmath76 km / sec , indicating that the cloud is likely a chance superposition .",
    "the absence of an hi reservoir for and v may not be surprising since , with a distance of 118 kpc from the center of m31 , this galaxy falls within the 250 kpc radius where local group dwarf spheroidals appear to have low hi contents ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , we do not find a statistically signicant population of upper agb stars near the center of and v , suggesting that the galaxy did not experience significant star formation during intermediate epochs . at present , the only dwarf spheroidal companion of m31 to show evidence for star formation during intermediate epochs is and ii ( da costa et al .",
    "2000 ) , whereas many of the dwarf spheroidal companions of the milky - way contain intermediate - age populations .",
    "it thus appears that the star - forming histories of the milky - way and m31 dwarf spheroidal systems may have been systematically different .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the project scientists ( david crampton and roger davies ) , the project manager ( rick murowinski ) , and the countless others at the herzberg institute of astrophysics , the astronomy technology center , durham university , and the gemini observatory who worked so hard to design , construct , deliver and commission gmos .",
