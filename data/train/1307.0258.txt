    "sensing ( cs ) problem in the noiseless setting considers the estimation of an unknown and sparse signal vector @xmath0 from a vector of linear observations @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is often referred as measurement matrix or @xmath4 @xmath5 and only a small number ( the sparsity index ) , @xmath6 , of elements of @xmath7 are non - zero .",

    "the sparsity is often defined as @xmath10 .",
    "the solution to this system of equations is known to be given by the vector that minimizes @xmath11 ( @xmath12-norm ) subject to @xmath13 , which is a non - convex optimization problem . in @xcite",
    ", it was established that the vector @xmath14 with minimum @xmath15-norm subject to @xmath16 coincides with @xmath17 whenever the measurement matrix satisfies the well - known restricted isometry property ( rip ) condition .",
    "the connection between cs and channel coding ( cc ) has been explored extensively in recent years@xcite .",
    "the sensing process in cs , i.e. , @xmath18 , is very similar to encoding in cc if the @xmath19 is considered as a generator matrix while the reconstruction process in cs looks also similar to decoding in cc .",
    "therefore , the sensing process in cs is often referred as @xmath20 and the recovery process as @xmath21 .    in general",
    ", the sensing matrix in compressed sensing can be either @xmath22 or @xmath23 according to the density of the nonzero entries in the sensing matrix .",
    "as a special class of sparse matrices , the parity - check matrices of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes have the favorite feature of a constant ( average ) number of non - zero entries in each row when the code length may increase without bound . due to the potential advantages on both @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "sparse sensing matrices have gained increasing interest in cs . with the bipartite - graph representation of any sparse measurement , various message - passing algorithms originally developed for decoding sparse - graph codes have been introduced for reconstruction of sparse signals@xcite .",
    "the connection between ldpc codes and cs was addressed in detail in @xcite .    among various message - passing algorithms ,",
    "the verification algorithm was first introduced for compressed sensing in @xcite .",
    "it is essentially identical to the earlier idea of verification decoding of packet - based ldpc codes @xcite as recognized by zhang and pfister @xcite .",
    "this observation allowed a rigorous analysis of the verification decoding for compressed sensing via density evolution @xcite .",
    "the verification algorithm can be efficiently implemented with the complexity @xmath24 . in the literature , there are two categories of verification algorithms : node - based and message - based @xcite . in general , the node - based algorithms have better performance and lower complexity .    for non - negative sparse signals , a new message - passing algorithm , referred as the interval - passing ( ip ) algorithm ,",
    "was proposed in @xcite , which can perform better than the verification algorithm for some ldpc - based sensing matrices @xcite .",
    "the ip algorithm can be implemented efficiently with the complexity @xmath25 .    in this paper , we focus on the two iterative message - passing reconstruction algorithms , i.e. , the ip algorithm and the node - based verification algorithm . as the basic mechanism is somewhat different for the two message - passing algorithms",
    ", it remains open if one can find a message - passing algorithm taking advantages of both .",
    "indeed , we propose a novel verification - based interval - passing algorithm for recovery of @xmath26 sparse signals , in which the mechanism of verification decoding can be concisely incorporated .",
    "in this paper , we consider a special class of sparse measurement matrices , the parity check matrices of binary ldpc codes .",
    "it is well known that an ldpc code can be well defined by the null space of its sparse parity - check matrix . for any given sparse parity - check matrix ,",
    "it can be efficiently represented by a bipartite graph .",
    "a bipartite graph has two sets of nodes representing the code symbols and the parity - check equations .",
    "these are called `` variable '' and `` check '' nodes , respectively .",
    "an edge connects a variable node @xmath27 to a check node @xmath28 if and only if @xmath27 appears in the parity - check equation associated with @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , a sparse sensing matrix has its own bipartite graph , which is referred as @xmath4 @xmath29 . due to the close relation between cs and cc @xcite ,",
    "it is very helpful to describe iterative reconstruction algorithms over the sensing graph .",
    "let @xmath30 be the bipartite graph of a sensing matrix @xmath31 $ ] , where the set of variable nodes @xmath32 represents the signal components ( or columns of @xmath19 ) and the set of check nodes @xmath33 represents the set of sensing constraints ( or rows of @xmath19 ) satisfied by the signal components .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we denote the set of variable nodes that participate in check @xmath28 by @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , we denote the set of checks in which variable node @xmath27 participates as @xmath35 .      for nonnegative sparse signals , the ip algorithm iteratively computes the simple bounds of each signal component , i.e. , both lower and upper bounds . with sufficient expansion guarantee for the sensing graph ,",
    "it was proved in @xcite that either the lower or the upper bound can converge to the same value for each variable node .",
    "therefore , it can successfully estimate the sparse signal with a well - designed sensing graph .",
    "the ip algorithm can be described in a rigorous message - passing form .",
    "it consists of two alternative update rules for messages along edges , one for check nodes and the other for variable nodes .",
    "in general , there are two bounding messages for any directed edge from @xmath28 to @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath36 for the lower bound and @xmath37 for the upper bound .",

    "sensing , the node - based verification algorithm works iteratively in a progressive way for recovering the signal components ( variable nodes ) .",
    "once a variable node is recovered , it is attached to the state of @xmath43 ; otherwise , it is @xmath44 . at the beginning of @xmath21",
    ", all the variable nodes are initialized as @xmath44 . in each @xmath21 iteration , it employs three simple rules as follows .",
    "* s1 : if a measurement at `` check node '' @xmath28 is zero , all the variable nodes neighbor to @xmath28 are verified as a zero value and labeled as @xmath43 . *",
    "s2 : for a degree-1 measurement @xmath45 , the variable node neighbor to @xmath28 is verified as the value of @xmath45 and labeled as @xmath43 . *",
    "s3 : for a variable node @xmath27 subject to which there are @xmath46 identical measurements ( @xmath47 with @xmath48 for some @xmath49 ) , all variable nodes neighboring a subset of these check nodes @xmath50 ( not all of them ) are verified with the value zero and labeled as @xmath43 .",
    "then , the verified variable node propagates its state to the other check nodes in its neighborhood so that these check nodes can remove the contribution of this variable node from their respective measurement and try to infer , in the next round , the values of the remaining variable nodes connected to them .",
    "the above three rules in their rigorous form were reported in @xcite .",
    "the only difference here lies in the rule s3 . in @xcite",
    ", it includes the mechanism that the @xmath51 variable node neighboring these check nodes is verified with the common value of the check nodes .",
    "this additional mechanism , however , is not required considering the rule s2 .",
    "this rigourous form of s3 may not be fully recognized in @xcite and the authors in @xcite rediscovered this mechanism to cope with cycles of length-4 in the sensing graph .    in what follows , we provide a precise implementation of the above three rules thanks to various formulations in @xcite .",

    "the state of variable node @xmath27 is denoted as @xmath52 .",
    "then , @xmath53 is used to denote the variable node @xmath27 in a @xmath43 state , and @xmath54 means @xmath44 . for an efficient implementation of the rule s3",
    ", we introduce the state of coincidence @xcite with @xmath55 for identifying the variable node @xmath27 when it accepts @xmath46 identical measurements and @xmath56 for signalling the check node @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 if @xmath59 and zeros otherwise .",
    "initially , @xmath60 $ ] ; @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "then , two alternative update rules for the node - based verification algorithm can be stated as follows .",

    "as shown , both the ip algorithm and the verification algorithm can be described in the form of message - passing decoding .",
    "although both algorithms require the expansion property of the sensing graph , their mechanisms in recovering the signal are somewhat different and simulations show their difference in recovery patterns .    therefore , it is natural to ask if there is a message - passing algorithm in favor of the recovery mechanisms of both algorithms .",
    "in this section , we can answer the question in an affirmative manner . in",
    "what follows , we propose a verification - based interval - passing algorithm , which keeps all the messages appeared in the ip algorithm .",

    "* check node update * : @xmath79    * if ( @xmath56 ) and ( @xmath63 ) @xmath80    * variable node update * ( only for @xmath65 ) : @xmath81    1 .",
    "if ( @xmath71 ) and ( @xmath72 ) @xmath73 2 .",

    "the new algorithm performs always better than either the ip algorithm or the verification algorithm .",
    "given a nonnegative sparse signal @xmath7 and any measurement vector @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 denote the set of verified nodes at the @xmath86th decoding iteration .",
    "hence , it is enough to prove that @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where the subscripts @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 mean the new algorithm , the verification algorithm and the ip algorithm , respectively .",
    "firstly , the probability of false verification has been demonstrated to be zero for the verification algorithm if the nonzero entries of the source signal are continuously distributed @xcite .",
    "for the ip algorithm , it always output the correct decision @xmath92 if it converges at some variable node @xmath27 since @xmath93 always holds in the decoding process .",
    "hence , it follows that the probability of false verification is zero for the new algorithm .",
    "now , it is clear that @xmath88 as no error propagation occurs .",
    "secondly , the two rules ( s1/s3 ) employed by the verification algorithm still hold for the new algorithm .",
    "hence , it is enough to show that the rule s2 still holds .",
    "indeed , whenever @xmath94 for any check node @xmath28 , it means that there are @xmath95 @xmath43 variable nodes neighbouring to @xmath28 .",
    "let us denote @xmath96 as the remaining unverified node ( only one ) neighbouring to @xmath28 .",
    "hence , @xmath97 as it is verified . with the update operations at check node @xmath28 , @xmath98 holds surely .",
    "it follows that @xmath87 .       comparing the proposed algorithm with the ip algorithm , it is straightforward to show that the complexity of the proposed algorithm scales the same as that of the ip algorithm . for the quasi - cyclic ( qc ) ldpc - based",

    "sparse signals are generated as follows .",
    "first , the support set of cardinality @xmath99 is randomly generated .",

    "the parity - check matrix is of size @xmath105 and it has cycles of length-4 .",
    "the same phenomena has been observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , which is clearly different with the results reported in @xcite , where the verification algorithm performs poorly due to lack of mechanism to cope with cycles of length-4 .",
    "we have proposed a new message - passing reconstruction algorithm for nonnegative sparse signals . this new message - passing algorithm , as a combination of both the ip algorithm and the verification algorithm , has been shown to perform better than either the ip algorithm or the verification algorithm for ldpc - based sensing matrices .",
    "the complexity of the new algorithm scales the same as that of the ip algorithm .      ",
    "the verification algorithm discussed is only equivalent to the s3 rule if the edge weight of the sensing graph comes from a continuous distribution ( or its sampled version with infinitely many elements ) .",
    "otherwise , it is very easy to come up with examples that the algorithm proposed there does not perform like the s3 rule .",
    "indeed , it is very easy to show that in order to capture the s3 rule , one needs a memory state with 2 levels ( variable nodes knowing about other variable nodes and check nodes knowing about other check nodes ) . the only way that you can implement the s3 rule with one level of memory ( message passing ) is to have continuous distribution on the edges of the sensing graph . \"        in this paper , we always assume a binary edge weight for ldpc - based sensing graph . consider the case of fig .",

    "then , according to the s3 rule , the variables @xmath110 are verified with the value zero .",
    "this can be precisely implemented .",
    "however , it requires that the variable nodes are visited according to a descending order of the number of identical measurements inherited to each variable node . in practice , this can be omitted as the occurrence of @xmath111 identical measurements is rare .",
