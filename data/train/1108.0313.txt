    "@xcite studied the region from the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) in the 30 @xmath0 m band with a resolution of 8.5 \" , and reported that structures in the region have temperatures ranging from about 70 k to 100 k. they found the total luminosity of the components in the inner region ( from their table 1 ) to be @xmath86@xmath18 @xmath15 and its mass @xmath82000 @xmath3 .",
    "surrounding the central cavity , extending from 1 pc to @xmath8 5 pc , is the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) .",
    "the cnd has a mass of several thousand solar masses , and rotates with a velocity @xmath8 100 km@xmath19s@xmath20 .",
    "the neutral material in this ring is clumpy , dense ( n(h@xmath21 ) @xmath22 @xmath23 ) , and fragmented @xcite having a filling factor @xmath810 @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "there is a clumpy and filamentary structure known as the mini - spiral that connects the cnd with the central ionised cavity , allowing ultraviolet radiation from the central ionised cavity to penetrate into the cnd , heating and photoionising the gas @xcite .    the kinetic temperatures of the gas in the cnd and central cavity ranges as high as 200 k - 300 k in co(j = 7 - 6 ) @xcite and @xmath8400 k in nh3 ( 6,6 ) @xcite .",
    "the source of heating remains unclear .",
    "one explanation suggested is that the ionised central cavity is excited by the radiation from a central cluster of o and b stars , and that at the cavity edge the surrounding material is likely to be shock compressed by the expanding gas around the pdrs .",
    "other possibilities include c - shock heating , perhaps by magnetic viscous heating , or possibly turbulent dissipation .",
    "@xcite suggest mhd ( magneto hydrodynamics ) shock heating with a shock velocity of order 20 - 30 km@xmath19s@xmath20 , and a magnetic field 0.3 - 0.5 mg .",
    "if so , the material in the cnd will dissipate its orbital energy within a few revolutions , and they suggest that its apparent longevity may result from refueling by infalling material from the surrounding clouds .",
    "several authors suggest that the ionisation of the molecular clouds in the galactic centre is due to a large flux of cosmic rays heating the region @xcite .",
    "the cnd is surrounded by a number of dense molecular clouds and filamentary structures ( see figure  [ fig : composite ] ) . at a distance of @xmath839 pc to the",
    "north east of sgra@xmath1 is the radio arc consisting of thermal and nonthermal structures aligned almost perpendicularly to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the radio arc seems to connect to sgra@xmath1 via two concentrations of ionised and molecular gas : the sickle and the arched filaments .",
    "two clusters of wr and o - type stars , the quintuplet and the arches cluster , are responsible for the ionisation of the sickle and the arched filaments , respectively .",
    "the arches cluster is slightly in the foreground , about 20 pc from the arched filaments , and irradiates the several filaments approximately uniformly @xcite .    the msx image at 21.3 @xmath0 m and the pacs image at 70 @xmath0 m trace a shell surrounding the arches and quintuplet clusters .",
    "the shell goes through the arched filaments , the lima bean and passes through the south of the g0.11 - 0.11 molecular cloud forming a ring of @xmath844 pc in diametre ( figure  [ fig : composite ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the radiation and the stellar winds from the arches and the quintuplet clusters and the black hole in sgra@xmath1 may be responsible for the formation of this shell , which can clearly be seen at the spitzer 24 @xmath0 m image @xcite , and which has also been reported by @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to further constrain the physical conditions in the central 2 parsecs of the galactic centre , and to help clarify the excitation conditions .",
    "we use archival herschel pacs and spire photometric observations of the region to determine the dust properties more accurately ; many earlier data sets at shorter wavelengths @xcite would have been insensitive to a cold dust component .",
    "we also incorporate previously unpublished infrared images from the infrared space observatory long wavelength spectrometer ( iso - lws ) , operating in parallel mode ; its grating sampling allows us to obtain a more precise analysis of the character and structure of dust in the central region and the cnd .",

    "the basic data were obtained from the public herschel archive , and were reprocessed using hipe , the herschel interactive processing environment .",
    "the data were collected in parallel mode and are still rather preliminary in absolute accuracy , suffering from calibration errors .",
    "pacs fluxes off the bright galactic plane are negative , indicating that the pipeline corrections are inaccurate ; moreover there are indications that in this extremely bright region some non - linear detector responses are uncorrected .",
    "we do not apply any across - the - board offsets to get positive flux values . as a result ,",

    "the msx data can also be used to study the morphology , dynamics and physics of the ism providing the thermal emission from dust grains at mid infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we used the msx band e data at 21.3 @xmath0 m to trace the warm dust across the galactic centre .",
    "we also report in this paper previously unpublished observations of sgr a@xmath1 , taken by the long wavelength spectrometer ( spectral range 46 - 180 @xmath0 m ) on the infrared space observatory satellite in parallel mode .",
    "iso was equipped with two spectrometers : sws and lws , a camera : isocam , and an imaging photopolarimeter : isophot to cover wavelengths from 2.5 to 240 @xmath0 m with spatial resolutions of 1.5 `` , at the shortest wavelengths , and 85''-90 \" at the longer wavelengths .",
    "two instruments , lws and isocam , were able to operate simultaneously in parallel mode .",
    "more than 100,000 individual pointings were made in parallel mode in over 17,000 individual observations with a total sky coverage of about 1@xmath24 .",
    "key to our study , the lws operated with ten wavelengths in the range 46 - 180 @xmath0 m @xcite , each with bandwidths of about 0.3 @xmath0 m for the five short wavelength detectors ( sw ) and 0.6 @xmath0 m for the five long wavelength detectors ( lw ) .",
    "parallel mode maps are generated by combining different raster scans .",
    "several data reduction tools were developed in the idl programming language and these form the lws parallel interactive analysis package that can be found at : http://jackal.bnsc.rl.ac.uk/iso/lws/software/software.html    now that the herschel observations have obtained longer wavelength coverage , out to 500 @xmath0 m , the earlier iso data can reliably be combined with them to prepare a more comprehensive picture . in particular , the spectral information obtained with iso - lws allows us to determine the peak wavelength and flux of the dust emission with much greater precision than is possible with broad - band photometry ; this in turn allows us to specify the conditions of excitation much more accurately .",
    "herschel pacs and spire photometry have a much higher spatial resolution in the fir than any previous mission .",
    "when analysed , the maps provide a much improved spatial distribution of the fluxes , temperature , spectral index , and h@xmath21 column density across the galactic centre region .",
    "the msx 21.3 @xmath0 m images provide an important measure of the warmer material in the region .",
    "figure  [ fig : composite ] shows the galactic centre as seen by combined images of msx - e 21.3 @xmath0 m ( blue ) , pacs 70 @xmath0 m ( green ) and spire 350 @xmath0 m ( red ) .",
    "the arched filaments , the radio arc and sgr a@xmath1 are clearly visible at 21.3 @xmath0 m and 70 @xmath0 m , while spire 350 @xmath0 m traces the very cold and dense molecular clouds .",
    "herschel resolves the central cavity and the surrounding cnd at 70 , 160 and 250 @xmath0 m ; the lower spire 350 and 500 @xmath0 m resolutions ( fwhm= 25.3``and 36.9 '' respectively ) are not quite able to resolve the cavity .    the observed continuum emission from the galactic centre region peaks at about 66 @xmath0 m , in the range of iso - lws detector sw3 ( figure  [ fig : total_continuum ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : total_continuum ] , the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can not be fit by a single grey body curve . in the ensuing discussion ,",
    "we present our procedure for decomposing the shape , which depends on the temperature , the number of grains along the line of sight , and their emissivity and spectral index , @xmath31 . at the longest wavelengths ,",
    "the grain properties determine the shape of the sed .",
    "we assume a grain size of @xmath32 @xmath0 m .",
    "the temperature and the spectral index , @xmath31 , distribution across the galactic centre was then obtained by fitting the pacs and spire wavelengths with a grey body curve :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the solid angle , t is the temperature and @xmath35 is the optical depth for a frequency @xmath36 , given as : @xmath37 @xmath38 is the bibitem optical depth at @xmath39 , the bibitem frequency , which was chosen to be c/100 @xmath0 m .",
    "the shape of the curve is only mildly sensitive to the choice of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the sed for each pixel in the herschel image was fitted after smoothing the images and adjusting the pixel sizes uniformly to the resolution of the spire 500 @xmath0 m channel band .",
    "the h@xmath21 column density was then derived assuming a gas - to - dust - ratio of 100 .",
    "we did not include the pacs 160 @xmath0 m image data with the other four herschel bands in the calculation of the temperature and the column density maps .    at the brightest regions , the flux values from this detector",
    "did not fit any physical sed , perhaps due to a poor correction of low level stripes in the data and/or errors on the background subtraction .",
    "moreover , in the low intensity regions the detector map has negative values possibly due to uncorrected gain adjustments @xcite . its omission will not affect the conclusions significantly ; subsequent pipeline reductions will hopefully address these issue .",
    "figures  [ fig : temperature ] ,  [ fig : column_density ] and  [ fig : emissivity ] show the resultant temperature , molecular hydrogen column density and @xmath31 maps , respectively ; north is up in all cases .",
    "the white circle on the temperature map , centred at sgra@xmath1 , shows the average size of the iso - lws beam which covers , approximately , the central cavity and the inner 1 pc of the cnd , for a distance to the region of 8.5 kpc . figure  [ fig : msxe_cnd ] shows the pacs 160 @xmath0 m map ; although the absolute calibration is defective , as noted , its higher resolution provides an improved picture of the cnd than does either the temperature or column density maps , which have been reduced to the spire 500 @xmath0 m beam size and are therefore unable to resolve the cnd and cavity structure .",
    "the temperature map ( figure  [ fig : temperature ] ) shows the most distinguishing details of the various structures in this complex region .",
    "as expected , due to the strong uv radiation and the stellar winds from the wr and the ob stellar clusters placed at the central cavity , as well as the electron heating due to magneto - hydrodynamic turbulences that take place in accretion states around the central black hole @xcite , sgra@xmath1 shows the highest temperature values , where t@xmath40 60 k.    this map beautifully resolves the arched filaments and sickle with dust temperatures t@xmath41 k , and the radio arc , with significantly lower temperatures than the arched filaments : t@xmath4228 k. as expected , the coldest region in the temperature map occurs in the giant molecular cloud g0.11 - 0.11 , whose temperatures are t@xmath43 k. as we discuss in more detail below and in figure  [ fig : gc_iso_lws ] , these results are in agreement with the iso - lws images , in which the arches ( for example ) fade away as the wavelength changes from 46 @xmath0 m to 178 @xmath0 m .",
    "@xcite used the kao at 50 and 90 @xmath0 m to map this region .",
    "they infer a dust temperature for the arches of 45 - 55 k using a @xmath31 = 1 , noticeably warmer and inconsistent with our result , in some part because @xmath31 is actually closer to 2 .",
    "@xcite reported that the more eastern filament ( called e2 ) might even be higher than 70 k. the new herschel - iso results show that there is considerable knotty structure along each of the filaments and elsewhere across the region , but that average dust temperatures are more accurately closer to 35 k.      the column density map ( figure  [ fig : column_density ] ) reveals the presence of numerous dense features most of which have been previously reported .",
    "@xcite discuss many of them based on their sharcii 0.35 mm and bolobam 1.1 mm continuum images with a resolution of 9 \" and 33 respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : column_density ] shows only about a factor of ten variations across most of the region , with few distinct structures being defined by their high column densities .",
    "the exception is the well defined , very dark cloud g0.11 - 0.11 with very low dust temperature , between 12 k and 18 k , and whose peak column densities exceed n(h@xmath21)@xmath44@xmath23 .",
    "by contrast , the total luminosity varies like t@xmath45 across the region , in which @xmath31 changes from about 1 to 3 , and the dust surface brightness varies by a factor of about 300 even in the less dense structures . the column density map closely anti - correlates with the temperature map , with denser regions being colder .    as a result of the low fluxes ,",
    "as noted earlier , the pacs photometry in the area of g0.11 - 0.11 has uncorrected negative values , and the density and @xmath31 values are approximately only . in figures  [ fig : column_density ] and  [ fig : emissivity ] , the scale has been intentionally stretched to highlight the less prominent structures at the expense of saturating the g0.11 - 0.11 area ) .",
    "the cloud itself is more accurately defined by the spire emission ( see figure  [ fig : composite ] , in red ) , and indeed the images reveal considerable knots and substructure across the source .",
    "the southerly extension to the source , visible in the three derived maps , is an artifact of the negative photometry in the low flux region ; spire emission clearly shows that the low flux is due to an absence of material rather than cold high density dust .",
    "we can nevertheless estimate a lower limit to the total mass of g0.11 - 0.11 as 1@xmath46 m@xmath11 .",
    "the map for @xmath31 is shown in figure  [ fig : emissivity ] ; it is also anti - correlated with the temperature map ( figure  [ fig : temperature ] ) .",
    "sgra@xmath1 , for example , the hottest region , shows the lowest values of @xmath31@xmath8 1.0 - 1.3 .",
    "the arched filaments and sickle show values in the range @xmath31@xmath81.3 - 1.8 and the range of @xmath31 values in the radio arc is @xmath31@xmath81.7 - 2.2 .",
    "the g0.11 - 0.11 molecular cloud shows extremely large values of @xmath473.5 .",
    "this general trend is expected ; dust grains in cold clouds tend to be larger in size and therefore have larger @xmath31 than grains in warm clouds @xcite .",
    "the strong and rapid spatial variations in the galactic centre , coupled with the herschel maps , provide one of the first clear looks at how this feature of grains manifests itself in a complex region .",
    "since the total luminosity varies roughly like t@xmath45 , this parameter also helps sort out the excitation and energetics of the various structures .",
    "the anticorrelation between temperature and density applies to most of the other dense regions of the maps as well , which , being dominated by dust properties , are coldest where they are most opaque ( figure  [ fig : column_density ] ) ; for example through the arched filaments , sickle , the radio arc and sgra@xmath1 .      the o and wr stars from the arches and the quintuplet clusters ( figure  [ fig : composite ] ) provide enough photons to ionise and heat sickle and the arched filaments @xcite and also generate strong winds that could contribute to the depletion of the largest dust grains whose population is traced by the n(h@xmath48 map : the largest dust grains can be destroyed due to the strong winds and the uv radiation from the massive o and wr stars from the arches and quintuplet clusters .    the msx - e map at 21.3 @xmath0 m ( figure  [ fig : msxe ] )",
    "can be used to trace the population of very small grains ( vsg ) throughout the galactic centre region ( this band is more reliable than the features observed at shorter infrared wavelengths which can be affected by extinction ) .",
    "vsgs are small ( with sizes of @xmath49 @xmath0 m ) , and absorption of one uv photon @xcite can increase their temperature up to 80 k , prompting them to re - emit at these shorter wavelengths ( @xmath50 @xmath0 m ) @xcite .",
    "the msx - e map correlates well with the temperature map , showing that the population of the small grains is distributed through the regions where the population of the largest grains has been depleted , i.e. the sickle and the arched filaments .",
    "this effect can also be observed in sgra@xmath1 : pacs 160 @xmath0 m , figure  [ fig : msxe_cnd ] , shows very low emission at this far - infrared wavelength in the central cavity of sgra@xmath1 , but which is surrounded by bright emission from the cnd .",
    "the emission in the inner parsec , as traced by msx - e at 21.3 @xmath0 m , appears confined to the central cavity where the o and b stars from the central cluster produce a strong radiation field , and where stellar winds heat up the small grains and deplete large grains . within the central 2 parsecs ,",
    "the largest grains are found remaining in the cnd itself , where they are shielded from the central strong uv radiation ; their emission is traced by herschel pacs+spire at far infrared wavelengths @xmath51",
    "@xmath0 m .",
    "iso - lws obtained images of the central region of the galaxy operating in its parallel mode , one image simultaneously from each of the ten iso - lws detectors , with the spectrometer s grating set at a fixed position near the centre of its scan range .",
    "the iso lws parallel mode maps provide us with complementary wavelength coverage just where it is most needed , at the peak of the dust emission , in the range of 46 to 180 @xmath0 m that can be used to defined the sed of sgra@xmath1 at far infrared wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately , with a beam of @xmath52 and a pixel size of 42 \" , these iso maps are unable to resolve as many structures as do higher resolution herschel pacs and spire data .",

    "we have used a radiative transfer code as described in @xcite , to simultaneously fit the continuum and the spectral lines , obtaining the best results for the case of two cnd components .",
    "we present the discussion of the gas properties through sgra@xmath1 in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "we present new herschel pacs and spire maps of the galactic centre , together with previously unpublished iso - lws 10-band parallel mode maps that enable us to obtain an accurate calibration for the central parsecs and a detailed spectral shape around the wavelength peak of the continuum emission .",
    "photometry from the data set allows us to model dust in the central 2 pc of the galactic centre .",
    "combined with msx - e 21.3 @xmath0 m images , we use these new results to trace the dust properties throughout the galactic centre region .    the iso lws continuum in the direction of sgr",
    "a * , extended with herschel data out to 500 @xmath0 m , is best fit by a model of a central cavity of 1 pc radius emitting like a greybody with t = 90 k and @xmath31= 1.23 and with low density n(h@xmath21)= 2.8@xmath82 @xmath23 .",
    "the region is surrounded by the circumnuclear disk represented by two different components : a hot component with a dust temperature of 44.5 k and n(h@xmath21)= 1.19@xmath83 @xmath23 with @xmath31= 1.35 , and a cold component with t@xmath69= 23.5 k , n(h@xmath21)= 2.41@xmath83 @xmath23 and @xmath31= 1.4 .",
    "the two components indicate that the cnd is not a single uniform body , but ( as suggested by the images and previous authors ) has numerous clumps , gaps , and substructures but whose average properties manifest these two basic behaviours .",
    "this simple model is able to reproduce the observed iso - lws continuum as well as the spire data at 250 @xmath0 m , 350 @xmath0 m and 500 @xmath0 m .",
    "the msx - e map traces the emission of the very small grains population through the radio arc , the sickle , the arched filaments and confined in the central cavity in sgra@xmath1 .",
    "these spatial structures are now directly detected in the far infrared , and , with the full sed available , their dust features are all characterized .",
    "as expected , the largest grains are distributed throughout the cnd and correspond to the densest and coolest molecular clouds .",
    "unresolved issues with the herschel photometry in the current dataset leaves the absolute accuracy of the coldest , densest regions ( like g0.11 - 0.11 ) approximate .",
    "dust opacity properties in the central cavity are typical of grains with a thin ice layer ; while the dust properties in the cnd , with lower temperature and highest densities , is more typical of dust grains with thick ice mantles .",
    "the total integrated continuum flux around the inner edge of the cnd and the central cavity provides a total mass of m@xmath8@xmath84 m@xmath11 .",
    "the luminosities obtained are l@xmath73 @xmath5 and l@xmath6 @xmath5 in the central @xmath82.0 pc in sgra@xmath1 .",
    "we thank the referee for his or her careful reading of the paper , and for the useful comments made .",
    "we are very grateful to tanya lim for her suggestions on the treatment of the iso lws parallel mode data .",

    "<S> we analyse the far infrared dust emission from the galactic centre region , including the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) and other structures , using herschel pacs and spire photometric observations . </S>",
    "<S> these herschel data are complemented by unpublished observations by the infrared space observatory long wavelength spectrometer ( iso lws ) , which used parallel mode scans to obtain photometric images of the region with a larger beam than herschel but with a complementary wavelength coverage and more frequent sampling with ten detectors observing at ten different wavelengths in the range from 46 to 180 @xmath0 m , where the emission peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we also include data from the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) at 21.3 @xmath0 m for completeness . </S>",
    "<S> we model the combined iso lws continuum plus herschel pacs and spire photometric data toward the central 2 pc in sagittarius a@xmath1 ( sgra@xmath1 ) , a region that includes the cnd . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fir spectral energy distribution is best represented by a continuum that is the sum of three grey - body curves from dust at temperatures of 90 , 44.5 , and 23 k. we obtain temperature and molecular hydrogen column density maps of the region . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the mass of the inner part of the cnd to be @xmath2 @xmath3 , with luminosities : l@xmath4 @xmath5 and l@xmath6 @xmath5 in the central 2 pc radius around sgra@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find from the herschel and iso data that the cold component of the dust dominates the total dust mass , with a contribution of @xmath7 @xmath3 ; this important cold material had escaped the notice of earlier studies that relied on shorter wavelength observations . </S>",
    "<S> the hotter component disagrees with some earlier estimates , but is consistent with measured gas temperatures and with models that imply shock heating or turbulent effects are at work . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dust grain sizes apparently change widely across the region , perhaps in response to the temperature variations , and we map that distribution . </S>"
