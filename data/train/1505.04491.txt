    "vector rogue wave(rw ) has been paid much attention , since the components in nonlinear systems are usually more than two and the dynamics of vector rw demonstrate many striking dynamics in contrast to the ones in scalar system .",
    "firstly , there are some new excitation patterns for vector rw , in contrast to the well - known eye - shaped one in scalar system @xcite . for example , dark rw was presented numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite for two - component coupled systems .",
    "four - petaled rw was reported recently in three - component coupled systems @xcite , and even two - component coupled system @xcite . secondly , the number of rw in temporal - spatial distribution plane is also different from the ones in scalar systems .",
    "we have demonstrated that two or four fundamental rws can emerge on the distribution plane @xcite , which is absent for scalar systems @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the two or four rw patterns were derived under some certain constrains on background fields @xcite . the relative wave vector for the two background fields should satisfy a certain relation with the background amplitudes .",
    "then , are the constrain conditions essential for these new distribution patterns ?",
    "we revisit on high - order rws by developing the deriving method .",
    "furthermore , the rw patterns for four rw pattern or six rw pattern are all eye - shaped one for the coupled model with constrain conditions . considering the four - petaled rw and",
    "anti - eye - shaped rw can exist in the system , one could expect that these different pattern can coexist for some special superposition cases .",
    "therefore , it is essential to find out how they can be superposed and the properties of the superposition .    in this paper",
    ", we present a method to derive high - order rw solution with releasing the constrains conditions on background fields .",
    "we find that two or four fundamental rws can emerge for the superposition of first - order rw with itself or the second - order vector rw in the coupled system without the constrain conditions before .",
    "especially , one four - petaled rw can coexist with three eye - shaped ones and other different pattern combination can exist in the coupled system , in contrast to the four eye - shaped ones coexisting case reported before .",
    "moreover , six rws can emerge on the distribution for the superposition of two second - order vector rws , which can be constituted of different fundamental rw patterns .",
    "for example , three four - petaled and three eye - shaped ones can coexist on the distribution plane .",
    "these results are different from the ones in our previously reported results @xcite , and could further enrich our knowledge on rw excitation dynamics in many different coupled systems .",

    "it is seen that at the same location , one anti - eye - shaped rw in one component corresponds to an eye - shaped rw in the other component .",
    "it should be noted that the case for a four - petaled rw coexisting with an eye - shaped rw is distinctive from the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    for the general case @xmath110",
    ", we merely give a special example to show its dynamics .",
    "for instance , we choose the parameters @xmath111}=10,\\\\ \\chi_2=&-\\frac{\\sqrt { 3}}{2}+i{\\frac { \\sqrt { 3}-6}{66}}\\sqrt { 207 - 48 \\sqrt { 3}},\\,\\ , \\alpha_2^{[0]}=0 ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] then we obtain the figure ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "one eye - shaped rw and a four - petaled rw coexist in one component , and an anti - eye - shaped rw with an eye - shaped rw coexist in the other component",
    ". these would provide us more interesting excitation patterns for two rw case in coupled system .",
    "it should be noted that the above patterns all contains eye - shaped rw .",
    "can an anti - eye - shaped rw coexist with a four - petaled one ?",
    "it has been shown that this pattern can emerge in one component in a three - component coupled system @xcite .",
    "we are not sure whether this pattern can emerge in this two - component coupled system .",
    "* c ) second - order rogue wave solution *    as the second - order rw in scalar system @xcite , the second - order rw solution here is still obtained by superposition of fundamental rw solutions with the same spectral parameter .",
    "therefore , one can obtain three fundamental rws with identical pattern in each component for the second - order rw solution , which is similar to the ones in scalar case .",
    "but the three fundamental rws can be three eye - shaped ones , three anti - eye - shaped ones , and three four - petaled ones , in contrast three eye - shaped ones in scalar system . by choosing parameters ,",
    "we can obtain the different types of rw solution .",
    "the three rws can be superposed together , and construct symmetric structure as the second - order rw with highest peak for scalar nls @xcite . however , it is usually very complicated to obtain the symmetric structure since there are much more parameters than the one for scalar nls .",
    "based on the solution form presented here , we can obtain them more easily .",
    "we show them by three categories .    with @xmath112 and @xmath94 ,",
    "it is possible to obtain three eye - shaped rws or four - petaled rws in both components . as an example , we show dynamics of the second - order rw with highest peak with @xmath113 in ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . then , which three fundamental rw pattern constitute the pattern in fig .",
    "4 ? the values of parameters @xmath32 and @xmath23 can be used to analyze the patterns in fig .",
    "4 based on the above criterions for clarifying fundamental rw .",
    "it is proven that the patterns in the two components are both superimposed by three four - petaled rws .",
    "the second case is with @xmath102 and @xmath94 . in this case , the patterns for rw in two components are different .",
    "as an example , we show the dynamics of them with @xmath114 in fig .",
    "it is seen that the patterns in two components are indeed different .",
    "then , we can also clarify which fundamental rw pattern superpose the patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for the patterns in fig . 5 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 . from the value of @xmath90 , we can know that the pattern in @xmath108 is superimposed by three eye - shaped rws , and the pattern in @xmath109 is constituted of three anti - eye - shaped ones .",
    "it is shown that three eye - shaped rws admits the largest peak value among these three different pattern superposition ways , and the anti - eye - shaped ones admits the lowest value ( compare the peak values in fig . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the third case is the general case with @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "the dynamics of rw can be investigated by second - order solution .",
    "the patterns of them are superposed by three eye - shaped ones ( similar to fig .",
    "5(a ) ) , or three four - petaled ones ( similar to fig .",
    "4(a ) or ( b ) ) , or three anti - eye - shaped ones ( similar to fig .",
    "5(b ) ) . therefore",
    ", we do not show the figures .",
    "* d ) superposition for the second - order rogue wave solution *    from the superposition of these different types rw solutions , we can obtain some novel dynamics behavior . we give them by two different categories .",
    "the first case is the interaction between the first - order rw and second - order rw .",
    "the second case is the interaction between two second - order rws .",
    "the superposition for the interaction between the first - order rw and second - order rw can demonstrate cases that there are four rws on the temporal - spatial distribution plane . especially , the four rws can admit many different patterns .",
    "it is possible to obtain at least @xmath120 different patterns , such as three eye - shaped ones with one anti - eye - shaped rw in both components , three eye - shaped ones with a four - petaled rw in both components(which includes two distinctive cases : rw patterns in the two components at the same locations are identical or different ) , the combined ones in each component(corresponding to fig .",
    "3 case ) , and the inverse cases of them .",
    "for example , we show one case that one four - petaled rw coexist with three eye - shaped rws in fig .",
    "all these patterns are in contrast to the four eye - shaped ones obtained before @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear interactions among them can induce many other different patterns based on these 8 fundamental pattern combinations .",
    "moreover , we can observe the superposition of two second - order rw solutions .",
    "there are six rws in the distribution plane .",
    "the patterns of them can be different , in contrast to the six eye - shaped ones obtained with constrain conditions on background fields @xcite .",
    "the six rws just possess two types of fundamental rw pattern and each type pattern is occupied by three rws .",
    "we find that it is possible to obtain at least @xmath121 different patterns , mainly including three cases corresponding to fig .",
    "1 - 3 and one case similar to fig . 1 but with rw patterns in the two components at the same locations are different .",
    "as an example , we show one case that three four - petaled rws and three eye - shaped ones coexist in fig .",
    "many different superposition patterns can be obtained by varying the parameters based on these 4 fundamental pattern combinations .",
    "in this paper , we present a method to derive high - order rw for coupled nls model with no constrain conditions on background fields . it is demonstrated that coexistence of rws with different patterns can emerge in the coupled system .",
    "for example , one four - petaled rw and three eye - shaped ones can coexist , in contrast to the four eye - shaped ones reported before .",
    "three four - petaled rw and thee eye - shaped ones can constitute some new patterns for six fundamental ones case .",
    "there are many other different cases for the coexistence of rws with different patterns .",
    "the superposition of different order rw solution can demonstrate more complex dynamics for rw excitation in the coupled systems .",
    "these rw pattern excitations are all in contrast to the ones in scalar nls equation and the previous results obtained in coupled nls systems . since our formula is given by an algebraic form , it is possible to investigate dynamics of any order rw solution ( for instance the explicit figure for 20-th or higher order rw ) by computer soft .",
    "these results will further enrich our realization on rw dynamics in many different nonlinear physical systems . the method provided in this paper",
    "can be extended to derive the high - order rw solutions for coupled hirota equations and even @xmath122-component nls system or @xmath122-wave system with a general case .",
    "note added .",
    "very recently , chen and mihalache presented fundamental and second - order rw solutions in the same coupled model @xcite .",
    "some of their results are overlapped with ours .",
