    "entanglement is a key resource in quantum information theory .",
    "if used as a resource it can perform numerous tasks which seem rather impossible for classical resources and shared randomness .",
    "quantum game theory is no exception in this regard where entanglement plays vital role in the solution of games .",
    "the first step to this direction was by eisert _",
    "et al_. @xcite who introduced an elegant scheme for the quantization of prisoner dilemma ( pd ) . in this scheme",
    "the strategy space of the players is a two parameter set of @xmath0 unitary matrices . starting with maximally entangled initial state the authors showed that for a suitable quantum strategy the dilemma disappeared .",
    "they also pointed out a quantum strategy which always won over all the classical strategies . later on marinatto and weber @xcite introduced another interesting and simple scheme for the analysis of non - zero sum classical games in quantum domain .",
    "they gave hilbert structure to the strategic spaces of the players .",
    "they also used maximally entangled initial state and allowed the players to play their tactics by applying probabilistic choice of unitary operators .",
    "they applied their scheme to an interesting game of battle of sexes and found out the strategy for which both the players can achieve equal payoffs .",
    "both these quantization _ _  _ _ schemes gave interesting results for various quantum analogues of classical games flitney , azhar , azhar1,azhar2,jiang , rosero , nawazbattle .",
    "in all these cases entanglement played a crucial role .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that  all the non classical properties of quantum correlations can not be analyzed by entanglement only @xcite .  instead of entanglement",
    "quantum discord ( qd ) is introduced as a feature of quantumness of correlations that remains there even for separable states .  since then various aspects of qd has been studied @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the role of qd in quantization of games .",
    "to elaborate this role we start our game with werner - like states which have very interesting proprties .",
    "these states are linear combination of a maximally entangled and a maximally mixed state @xcite .",
    "their entanglement and nonlocality depends upon a parameter @xmath1 @xmath2 that parameterizes them .",
    "for @xmath3 they are separable ,  for @xmath4 @xmath5 entangled but not nonlocal and for the range @xmath6 they become inseparable and nonlocal @xcite . in the recent years",
    "these states have been investigated from different perspective like entanglement teleportation via werner states @xcite , entanglement of werner derivatives , bell violation and entanglement  of werner states of two qubits in independent decay channels @xcite and their application in ancilla assisted process tomography @xcite .",
    "it has also been reported that despite being nonlocal , for certain range of parameter @xmath7 when shared between two parties these states are a powerful  resource in comparison to classical randomness . in ref . harold",
    "the qd for these states has been found and shown positive for all @xmath8 this behavior of these states is in contrast with their well known separability at @xmath9 .",
    "here we quantize pd and chicken game ( cg ) using our generalized quantization scheme taking werner - like state as an initial quantum state @xcite . in this scheme measurement",
    "can be performed in both entangled and product basis .",
    "_ _  _ _ for the measurement in entangled basis our results show that the strategy pair @xmath10 remains nash equilibrium for both these games as in the quantization scheme of eisert et al .",
    "@xcite for all values of @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath9 unentangled quantum state with non zero qd is capable of resolving dilemmas in pd and cg .",
    "this shows that qd also has a crucial role in quantum games . for @xmath12",
    "when qdbecomes zero then the payoffs become constant and independent of the players strategies.@xmath11    this paper is organized as follows ; in sections ( [ prisoner ] ) and ( chicken ) we give a brief introduction to the classical versions of pd and cg respectively , section ( [ quantum ] ) deals with quantum discord harold and its role in quantum games and section ( [ conclusion ] ) concludes the results .",
    "this game starts with a story of two suspects , say alice and bob , who have committed a crime together .",
    "now they are being interrogated in a separate cell .",
    "the two possible moves for each player are to cooperate ( @xmath13 ) or to defect ( @xmath14 ) without any communication between them according to the following payoff matrix@xmath15 } } .",

    "thus ( @xmath16 ) results as the nash equilibrium of this game with payoffs @xmath17 which is not pareto optimal . however , it was possible for the players to get higher payoffs if they would have played @xmath13  instead of @xmath18 .",

    "the first to swerve to avoid a collision is the loser ( chicken ) and the one who keeps on driving straight is the winner .",
    "there is no dominant strategy in this game .",
    "there are two nash equilibria @xmath20 and @xmath21 the former is preferred by bob and the latter is preferred by alice .",
