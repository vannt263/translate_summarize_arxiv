    "important details of the complex statistical behaviour of fully developed turbulent flows are still unknown , cf .",
    "especially the effect of small scale intermittency , i.e. the phenomenon of finding unexpected frequent occurences of large fluctuations of the local velocity on small length scales , is an open problem .",
    "it is commonly accepted that small scale intermittency is due to some kind of cascading process : kinetic energy which is fed into the flow by external forces on some ( large ) scale @xmath0 is assumed to be in an equilibrium with the energy being dissipated by viscosity on the smallest scale @xmath1 .",
    "inbetween the integral length scale @xmath0 and the dissipation scale @xmath1 , energy is continuously transported towards smaller scales by the decay of eddies @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the turbulent cascade are usually characterized by means of the difference between the velocities at two points in space separated by the distance @xmath2 , the so  called longitudinal velocity increment @xmath3 : @xmath4 .",
    "\\label{inkdef}\\ ] ] the statistics of @xmath3 is commonly investigated by means of its moments @xmath5 , the so - called velocity structure functions . in the framework of the cascade picture it is natural to assume that , for scales @xmath2 within the inertial range @xmath6 , the @xmath7 are functions of the scale @xmath2 and the rate of energy transfer @xmath8 only : @xmath9 . assuming a constant rate of energy transfer , kolmogorov derived his famous result ( furtheron referred to as k41 ) for the structure functions : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out by landau @xcite , there is no reason to assume that a decaying eddy spreads its energy into equal parts . on the contrary ,",
    "it is likely that the decay of eddies is a stochastic process . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy dissipation rate @xmath11 is a spatially distributed random variable .",
    "accordingly , experimental studies yield significant deviations from kolmogorov s prediction @xcite",
    ".    the statistics of the energy dissipation rate is usually investigated by the scale  dependence of @xmath12 , the average of @xmath8 over a ball with radius @xmath2 located at @xmath13 : @xmath14 taking into account the stochastic nature of @xmath12 , kolmogorov derived a modified result for the structure functions which is in better agreement with experimental data ( @xcite , furtheron referred to as k62 ) .",
    "the statstics of the velocity increment can also be characterized by means of its probability density functions ( pdfs ) @xmath15 . while for large scales @xmath2 the pdfs are almost gaussian , the phenomenon of small scale intermittency shows up in a stretched exponential  like shape of the pdfs on small scales expressing very high probabilities for large values of @xmath16 .",
    "those deviations from the gaussian shape are closely related to the deviations of the structure functions from the k41 prediction @xmath10 and can be attributed to the stochastic nature of the average energy dissipation rate , see for example @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these results clearly show that @xmath12 has an important influence on the statistics of the velocity increment",
    ". it would therefore be highly desirable to have an experimental tool which allows for a precise characterization of the interdependence of those two quantities .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that such a tool is given by the framework of stochastic markovian processes .    in a recent series of papers @xcite",
    ", the markov analysis has been applied separately to the velocity increment and the energy dissipation rate .",
    "the idea , inspired by the cascade picture , is to consider the velocity increment @xmath3 ( or the energy dissipation rate @xmath12 ) as a stochastic variable which evolves in the scale @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 fulfills the mathematical condition for a markov process , the evolution of @xmath17 in @xmath2 can be described by means of the fokker ",
    "planck equation , a generalized diffusion equation for the pdf @xmath15 in the variables @xmath2 and @xmath17 .",
    "this equation is completely determined by two coefficients , drift and diffusion coefficient , respectively , which can be estimated from experimental data .",
    "the markov analysis thus provides a possibility to _ measure _ the stochastic differential equations governing the evolution of the stochastic variable @xmath17 in the scale @xmath2 without incorporating any models or assumptions on the physics of the systems .",
    "a detailed explanation of this method is presented in @xcite .",
    "the mathematics of markov processes can be generalized to multidimensional stochastic variables . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the mathematical theory of multidimensional markovian processes to establish an unified description of the joint statistical properties of the velocity increment and the averaged energy dissipation rate . analysing experimental data",
    ", we derive a fokker ",
    "planck equation describing the evolution of the joint pdf @xmath18 in the scale @xmath2 .",
    "the properties of this equation provide interesting new insights into the interdependence of the velocity increment and the averaged energy dissipation rate .",
    "in particular we differentiate between deterministic and stochastic coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we shortly summarize the mathematical formulation of multidimensional markovian processes in section [ theory ] . section [ eindim ] briefly recalls the results of the one dimensional analysis for the velocity increment and the averaged energy dissipation rate , respectively .",
    "a short description of the experimental set  up and the data is presented in section [ setup ] while the results of the two dimensional markov analysis are given in section [ results ] .",
    "a short summary and discussion of our results in section [ discussion ] will conclude the paper .",
    "this section gives a brief summary of the theory of multidimensional markovian processes .",
    "for a detailled discussion of the theorems summarized here , we refer the reader to standard textbooks like @xcite .",
    "we consider the two dimensional stochastic variable @xmath19 which is defined as : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the logarithm of the energy dissipation rate @xmath12 normalised by its ( scale independent ) expectation value : @xmath22 .",
    "the stochastic process underlying the evolution of @xmath23 in the scale @xmath2 is markovian , if the conditional pdf @xmath24 with @xmath25 fulfills the relation : @xmath26 @xmath27 denotes the probability for finding certain values for @xmath17 and @xmath28 at some scale @xmath29 , provided that the values of @xmath30 at all larger scales @xmath31 are known .",
    "the condition ( [ markovcond ] ) simply states that the transition from an eddy at scale @xmath32 characterized by @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the `` state '' @xmath35 at scale @xmath29 should not depend on what happens at larger scales .",
    "if the conditional pdfs fulfill the markov condition ( [ markovcond ] ) , any @xmath36point distribution of @xmath30 can be expressed as a product of conditional pdfs : @xmath37 equation ( [ chain ] ) is a remarkable statement : the knowledge of the conditional pdf @xmath38 ( for arbitrary scales @xmath2 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 ) is sufficient to determine any @xmath36point pdf of @xmath41 , i.e. : the entire information about the stochastic process is encoded in the conditional pdf .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that for markov processes the evolution of the conditional pdf in the scale @xmath2 can be described by the kramers - moyal expansion , a partial differential equation for @xmath42 in the variables @xmath41 and @xmath2 . according to pawula s theorem ,",

    "@xmath44 note that we changed notation writing @xmath45 instead of latexmath:[$p\\left ( \\ , { \\mathbf q}(r ) \\ ,    order to indicate that the conditional pdf is a function of the scale @xmath2 ( although @xmath2 , of course , is not a stochastic variable ) .    by multiplying the fokker ",
    "planck equation with @xmath47 and integrating with respect to @xmath48 , it can be shown that the same equation also describes the @xmath2evolution of the pdf @xmath49 .",

    "one may therefore hope to find estimates for the @xmath54 by extrapolating the measured conditional moments @xmath43 towards @xmath55 @xcite , see also @xcite .",

    "if furthermore the pdf of the stochastic forces are gaussian , i.e. if @xmath57 is @xmath59correlated white noise , the kramers - moyal expansion stops after the second term and the conditional pdf @xmath60 is described by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "in that case the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be calculated from the drift vector @xmath63 and the diffusion matrix @xmath51 . in it s formalism of stochastic calculus , @xmath61 and @xmath64",
    "are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is to be calculated by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath51 , taking the square root of each element of the diagonalized matrix and transforming the result back into the original system of coordinates .",
    "the langevin  equation offers an alternativ way to check the markovian properties of a stochastic variable .",
    "the idea which was originally proposed in @xcite is to estimate the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 from experimental data according to equations ( [ mkdef ] ) and ( [ dkdef ] ) and to calculate the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 according to equation ( [ fundgvond12 ] ) .",

    "if the realizations of the stochastic force obtained by this method are @xmath59correlated with zero mean and a gaussian distribution , the process is governed by the fokker - planck equation . we will use this method here instead of the one proposed in @xcite , since for multidimensional stochastic variables it is hardly possible to check the markov condition ( [ markovcond ] ) directly by means of multiconditional pdfs . also the numerical cost for the estimation of the coefficients @xmath54 of order three and higher grows considerably with the order k ( growth like @xmath71 ) .",

    "the turbulent cascade thus exhibits an elementary step size .",

    "the question of whether one of these functions is to be preferred requires further detailled experimental as well as theoretical investigations and is the subject of an ongoing study .",
    "although further investigations will be necessary to complete the two dimensional markov analysis of the turbulent cascade , the results obtained so far already allow for several interesting statements on the joint statistical properties of the longitudinal velocity increment and the averaged energy dissipation rate .",
    "a particularly remarkable result is obtained for the @xmath17component @xmath150 of the diffusion matrix , which is found not to depend on the velocity increment .",
    "this means that if the averaged energy dissipation rate @xmath12 was not a stochastic variable but constant , the pdf of @xmath3 would reduce to a rather simple gaussian distribution .",
    "the effect of small scale intermittency can thus clearly be traced back to the stochastic nature of @xmath12 .",
    "so far , our results are in accordance with earlier experimental investigations @xcite as well as with the assumptions underlying kolmogorov s models .",
    "significant new information , however , are found for the @xmath17component of the drift vector . we found that @xmath133 does not depend on the energy dissipation rate , in a first order approximation .",
    "this means that this coefficient is identical with the drift term of the one dimensional fokker ",
    "planck equation for @xmath80 , i.e. it reveals a linear dependence on @xmath17 with a slope @xmath138 given by eq .",
    "( [ gammaeindimink ] ) . with respect to the works",
    "@xcite it remains open to explain why @xmath83 deviates from the value @xmath196 .",
    "a further new important result is that the drift coefficient @xmath175 does not depend on the velocity increment @xmath17 and is a linear function of the logarithmic energy dissipation rate @xmath28 as specified by eq .",
    "( [ d1xvonxfunk ] ) .",
    "one thus obtains a system of two stochastic differential equations for the evolution of @xmath17 and @xmath28 in @xmath2 which are linked only via their stochastic terms while the deterministic parts of the equations for @xmath17 and @xmath28 do not depend on the other variable .    to summarize , the langevin  equation for the two dimensional stochastic variable @xmath197 reads : @xmath198 according to eq .",
    "( [ d2uuvalues ] ) , the coefficient @xmath199 in the stochastic part of the equation for @xmath3 is approximately constant in @xmath2 ( see also fig .",
    "[ d2uukoeffs ] ) .",
    "note also that , when rewritten in terms of @xmath12 , the stochastic term in the equation for @xmath3 exhibits a simple power  law dependence on the energy dissipation rate : @xmath200 ( see fig .",
    "[ d2uukoeffs]b ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the two dimensional equation ( [ twodimlangevinresult ] ) with the one dimensional langevin ",
    "equations for @xmath3 and @xmath21 discussed in section [ eindim ] .",
    "those equations read : @xmath201 compared to the one dimensional langevin  equation , the stochastic part of the equation for @xmath3 is considerably simpler for the two dimensional process .",
    "note also that the resulting equation for the evolution of @xmath3 in two dimensions is symmetric in @xmath202 : if @xmath28 was constant , the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ twodimlangevinresult ] ) would be symmetric in @xmath17 , thus leading to vanishing odd order moments .",
    "asymmetries of the velocity increment , which are of importance in kolmogorov s four  fifths law , can thus clearly be attributed to the influence of the energy cascade .",
    "while the equation for the velocity increment simplifies considerably in the two dimensional formulation , the diffusion coefficient @xmath189 seems to exhibit a more complex dependence on its arguments ( see fig .",
    "[ d2xx ] ) than the one dimensional coefficient @xmath203 .",
    "whether the dependence of @xmath176 on @xmath28 is in fact given by the rather complex form indicated in fig .",
    "[ d2xx](b ) is yet an open problem which requires further discussions of the experiemental uncertainties .",
    "however , it is also conceivable that an even more complete characterization of the turbulent cascade has to include the transversal velocity increment as well .",
    "such a three  dimensional analysis might lead to further simplifications of the diffusion terms .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained so far give reason to believe that the mathematical framework of stochastic markovian processes is a suitable tool for experimental investigations concerning the joint statistical properties of velocity increments and the energy dissipation rate in fully developed turbulence . as it is known that the fokker ",
    "planck equation holds for the conditional pdf as well , the knowledge of this equation also provides all information about any n  scale joint pdf of @xmath28 and @xmath17 , see equations [ chain ] and [ foplacond ] .",
    "thus any general moment of @xmath204 is known . in this way the phenomenological fokker ",
