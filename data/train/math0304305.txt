    "we will refer to the transformations ( ac1 ) - ( ac3 ) as the _ elementary ac - transformations_.    let @xmath15 be the cartesian product of @xmath4 copies of the group @xmath16 two @xmath4-tuples @xmath17 and @xmath18 from @xmath15 are called _ andrews - curtis equivalent _ ( or _ ac - equivalent _ ) if one of them can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of elementary ac - transformations . in this event ,",
    "we write @xmath19 .",
    "the relation @xmath20 is an equivalence relation on the set @xmath21 the following conjecture , which appears to be of interest in topology as well as group theory , was raised by j.j .",

    "is called _ balanced _ if @xmath26 the balanced presentation @xmath27 of the trivial group is called _",
    "standard_. we shall say that two presentations with the same generators are ac - equivalent if the tuples of relators in these presentations are ac - equivalent . plainly , the ac - conjecture is equivalent to the following one : _ every balanced presentation of the trivial group is ac - equivalent to the standard one with the same set of generators_.    there is a survey @xcite by r.g .",
    "burns and o. macedonska on the ac - conjecture from group theory viewpoint . for relevant topological results we refer to a survey @xcite by c. hog - angeloni and w. metzler .",
    "the prevailing opinion seems to be that the ac - conjecture is false .",
    "moreover , several potential counterexamples are known .",
    "we say that a balanced presentation of the trivial group @xmath28 is a _ potential counterexample _ to the ac - conjecture if , firstly , it is not known to be ac - equivalent to the standard one , and , secondly , no one of the elementary ac - transformations decreases the total length @xmath29 of the relators .",
    "below we list some of the shortest and the most established potential counterexamples :    * ( 1 ) * @xmath30 .    *",
    "( 2 ) * @xmath31 .    *",
    "( 3 ) * @xmath32 .",
    "the first two presentations have been known for almost 20 years ; for a discussion we refer to the survey @xcite .",
    "example ( 3 ) is the second presentation in the series    * ( 4 ) * @xmath33 ,    which is due to s. akbulut and r. kirby @xcite .",
    "this series has been known for 15 years .",
    "notice that for @xmath34 the series ( 4 ) gives the presentation    * ( 5 ) * @xmath35    which , until recently , has also been considered as a potential counterexample . in @xcite",
    "the first author proved that this presentation satisfies the ac - conjecture .",
    "for this purpose he designed a genetic algorithm to search for corresponding sequences of the elementary ac - transformations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this algorithm is also instrumental for the following theorem which is the main result of this paper .",
    "[ th:1 ] every balanced presentation of the trivial group on two generators with the total length of the relators at most 12 satisfies the andrews - curtis conjecture .",
    "the idea of the proof of this theorem is very simple : we list all balanced presentations of the trivial group on two generators where the total length of relators is at most 12 : @xmath36 and then apply the genetic algorithm to each of the listed presentations . however , there are two issues to address here .",
    "the first one concerns the listing of the trivial presentations .",
    "indeed , it is known that there is no algorithm to decide whether a group given by a finite presentation is trivial or not @xcite , @xcite .",
    "whether such an algorithm exists for balanced presentations is an open and difficult problem @xcite . in the particular case when the total length of relators in the presentations is at most 12 , the following result enables one to list the set @xmath37    let @xmath38 be a group defined by a presentation [ th:2 ]    * ( 6 ) * @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "if the abelianization of @xmath38 is trivial then @xmath38 is either the trivial group or @xmath38 is isomorphic to the following finite group of order 120 @xmath41    the proof of this theorem is based on computer computations with the software package magnus .",
    "we discuss the proof in section 2 .",
    "the second issue is related to the real time required to carry out the computations with the genetic algorithm .",
    "it turns out that there are about @xmath42 presentations in the set @xmath37 to run the genetic algorithm on each of them would take too much time .",
    "so one has to exploit tricks and shortcuts ( pribambases ) to decrease the time .",
    "we discuss this in section 2 .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to note here that the presentations from @xmath43 with total length up to 10 are relatively easy to reduce to the standard one by ac - transformations .",
    "so , the minimal total length of relators in non - trivial examples from @xmath43 appears to be 11 .",
    "surprisingly enough , all the `` difficult '' presentations from @xmath43 with total length 11 ( which can not be easily reduced to the standard one ) are readily seen to be ac - equivalent to the presentation * ( 5 ) * : @xmath44 the most difficult examples to  crack \" are those with total length 12 , which can not be easily reduced neither to the standard one nor to the presentation * ( 5 ) * ( of length 11 ) .",
    "we list these most interesting presentations in the corollary below .",
    "the following presentations [ cor:1 ] of the trivial group are ac - equivalent to @xmath45 :    @xmath46 where @xmath47    one can find in @xcite the corresponding sequences of ac - transformations that reduce the presentations above to the standard presentation of the trivial group .",
    "it follows now from theorem [ th:1 ] that the minimal total length of relators in potential counterexamples , that still stand , is 13 .",
    "this allows us to formulate the following    [ cor:2 ] the presentation * ( 3 ) * : @xmath48 is , at the present time , a minimal potential counterexample to the andrews - curtis conjecture .",
    "we start with few known algorithms , which play an important part in our proofs .    in 1936 j.h.c .",
    "whitehead @xcite gave an algorithm which for given @xmath49-tuples @xmath50 and @xmath51 from @xmath52 decides whether there exists an automorphism @xmath53 such that @xmath54 furthermore , if such an automorphism exists , then the algorithm finds one .",
    "in general , the time - complexity of the whitehead algorithm is exponential .",
    "however , in the particular case when one needs to check whether a given element @xmath12 can be mapped by an automorphism of @xmath6 to the element @xmath55 the whitehead method is polynomial in time with respect to the length of @xmath56 ( for a given fixed @xmath57 ) . recall that an element @xmath12 is called _ primitive _ if @xmath58 for some @xmath59 it follows that we can recognize primitive elements in a free group of rank two quite effectively .",
    "the other algorithm that we used in our proofs is the todd - coxeter algorithm @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is a systematic procedure for enumerating cosets of a given finitely generated subgroup of a given finitely presented group .",
    "in particular , if the group given by a finite presentation is finite , then the todd - coxeter algorithm will eventually recognize this , and it will give a multiplication table of the group . at the present time , the todd - coxeter algorithm ( and its variations ) are among the most powerful application of computers to group theory ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this algorithm is relatively fast ( at least in our case ) ; it calculates the canonical invariants of the abelian group @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "one can find a complete description of the algorithm in the book @xcite by c.sims .",
    "now we explain how these methods can be used in proving theorems [ th:1 ] and [ th:2 ] .",
    "we combine both proofs into a single procedure that was carried out by a computer .",
    "this procedure consists of the following steps .    1 .",
    "generate a list @xmath62 of balanced presentations on two generators and with the total length of relators @xmath0 .",
    "there are about @xmath63 of such presentations .",
    "2 .   for each presentation",
    "@xmath64 in the list @xmath62 , check to see whether the abelianization of the group defined by @xmath64 is trivial or not .",
    "delete , one by one , all presentations from @xmath62 with a non - trivial abelianization .",
    "denote by @xmath65 the resulting list .",
    "plainly , all the trivial groups from @xmath62 are also in @xmath66 there are about @xmath42 presentations in @xmath66 3 .",
    "apply the whitehead algorithm to each of the relators in every presentation @xmath64 in @xmath65 to check whether the relator is a primitive element in @xmath6 or not .",
    "if the relator is primitive then the group defined by @xmath64 is trivial .",
    "moreover , it is not hard to see that , in this event , the presentation @xmath64 is ac - equivalent to the standard one @xcite .",
    "delete , one by one , all the presentations from @xmath65 with primitive elements among its relators .",
    "all the deleted presentations satisfy the ac - conjecture .",
    "denote by @xmath67 the resulting list .",
    "there are 122240 presentations in @xmath67 .",
    "4 .   observe that a cyclic permutation of a relator is a particular case of the transformation @xmath68 .",
    "we can use this to reduce the number of presentations in @xmath67 which belong to the same ac - equivalence class . compare presentations in @xmath67 , by cyclically permuting their relations , and leave only one presentation from each equivalence class . denote the resulting list by @xmath69",
    "only 1648 presentations are left in the list @xmath70 .",
    "5 .   at this point",
    "we want to sort out the presentations in @xmath70 which define the trivial group .",
    "we apply the todd - coxeter algorithm to each presentation @xmath64 from @xmath70 to compute the order of the group defined by @xmath71 notice that the todd - coxeter algorithm is time - consuming , so we want to apply it to as few presentations as possible . luckily , all the groups in the list @xmath70 happened to be finite , so the todd - coxeter algorithm eventually stopped and gave the answer .",
    "it turns out that all the groups in @xmath70 are trivial , except 16 groups of order 120 .",
    "it follows now that all the groups from @xmath65 are either trivial or of order 120 .",
    "to finish the proof of theorem [ th:2 ] it suffices to notice that all these groups are isomorphic to each other , and hence they are isomorphic to this particular one , given by the presentation @xmath72 indeed , every group of order 120 with trivial abelianization is a central extension of a cyclic group of order 2 by the simple group @xmath73 .",
    "all such groups are isomorphic .",
    "denote by @xmath74 the list of all presentations from @xmath70 which define the trivial group .",
    "there are 1632 presentations in @xmath75 6 .",
    "this is the last and the most time - consuming step .",
    "we apply the genetic algorithm from @xcite ( and some of its variations ) to check whether the presentations from @xmath74 satisfy the ac - conjecture .",
    "we show that every presentation from @xmath74 is ac - equivalent either to the standard presentation of the trivial group , or to the presentation * ( 5 ) * , or to one of the presentations in corollary [ cor:1 ] , which are already known to satisfy the ac - conjecture ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ at this step , all the presentations of the trivial group on two generators and with total length at most 12 have been shown to satisfy the ac - conjecture .",
    "this proves theorem [ th:1 ] .",
    "notice that in order to show that two presentations are ac - equivalent we use a modification of the genetic algorithm from @xcite in which the fitness function is replaced by a new one .",
    "namely , in this case we used the sum of the hamming distances between the relators as cyclic words . in most of the occasions the genetic algorithm with this new fitness function worked very fast .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a general discussion on genetic algorithms .",
