    "reactions under subdiffusion have attracted much attention in recent years due to their growing relevance for description of processes taking place in porous media such as certain geological formations or gels , in the crowded cell interiors and in many other strongly inhomogeneous environments including modern drug delivery systems .",
    "we focus here on the autocatalytic conversion @xmath1 , a reaction that exhibits travelling front solutions if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately , i.e. if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are initially separated in space @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on situations when subdiffusion can be modelled within the ctrw scheme with a waiting time probability density function ( pdf ) decaying according to a power law , @xmath4 .",
    "the continuous description of the @xmath1 reaction under subdiffusion , following locally the mass action law corresponding to the fkpp equation , was derived in @xcite and is given by a partial integro - differential equation with a kernel depending on the particle concentrations at all times .    in that preceding work",
    "we have shown analytically that the resultant minimal front velocity goes to zero under the assumption of a constant front shape , which was interpreted as propagation failure . in a following paper @xcite ,",
    "numerical simulations corroborated this picture , while two different regimes of front propagation were identified . in the fluctuation dominated regime ,",
    "pertinent to large reaction rates , the front velocity was found to decay as @xmath5 , whereas in the regime of small reaction rates , for which the continuous description applies , the front velocity was observed to go as @xmath6 .",
    "longer simulation runs of the continuous case ( small reaction rates ) revealed that after an intermediate regime that ranged over less than two orders of magnitude in time where @xmath7 applies , the exponent sets in to decay @xcite .",
    "hence the alleged exponent conjectured from the continuous picture was not the final one .",
    "up to now , there has not been any physically sound interpretation of the front velocities found in these simulations .    in this work",
    "we attempt to fill this gap by giving a crossover argument that is used to construct an ansatz for the solution of the reaction subdiffusion equation at the leading edge .",
    "we found that in order to maintain a front velocity that goes as @xmath7 , the additional assumption of the width of the front going as @xmath8 has to be made , so that the front does not maintain a constant form in the course of its propagation .",
    "since the front s width decreases with time , any real ( or simulated ) subdiffusive fkpp system will sooner or later undergo a change of regime : the front will get atomically narrow and the continuous scheme breaks down .",
    "physically this has to do with the fact that at large times the jump rate always becomes small compared to the reaction rate , so that the fluctuation dominated regime sets in .",
    "since the particles react before they are able to leave the site , the front becomes atomically sharp .",
    "we suggest that the findings in @xcite ( decay of the exponent characterizing the time dependence of the front velocity ) can be interpreted in the sense of a transition from the intermediate asymptotics of the reaction described by the continuous reaction - subdiffusion scheme to the final asymptotics corresponding to the fluctuation dominated regime .",
    "we start by presenting simple physical arguments in favor of this picture .",
    "we then show that the intermediate asymptotics with @xmath7 indeed appears as a possible solution of the corresponding integro - differential reaction - subdiffusion equation .",
    "physical arguments show however that this asymptotics can not be the final one , and that the final regime is fluctuation - dominated .",
    "we then turn to a numerical investigation of this fluctuation - dominated regime and show that the subdiffusive nature of the motion leads to additional fluctuation effects absent in the normal diffusive case .",
    "under normal diffusion and with the overall particle concentration @xmath9 being locally conserved , the @xmath1 reaction is described by the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovskii- piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xmath10 that has been extensively studied in the past . according to its classical solution @xcite , fronts propagating with velocities @xmath11 are possible , and it is moreover known that for step - like initial condition the solution with minimum speed , @xmath12 , is the one which is really achieved at long times .    in order to gain intuition about the front behavior under subdiffusion , we make use of the following idea : for any waiting time pdf @xmath13 with finite mean @xmath14 , the behavior at very long times @xmath15 corresponds to normal diffusion , so that the behavior pertinent to reaction - diffusion schemes is recovered only if time @xmath16 is large enough . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial domain of the pdf can be approximated by a power - law , @xmath17 up to some truncation time @xmath18 , the behavior at short times should correspond to the one in subdiffusion , and there must be a smooth crossover from one regime to the other .",
    "we therefore consider the truncated power - law waiting time distribution with truncation parameter @xmath18 , @xmath19 with mean value @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 .    for small times",
    "@xmath23 , when the system does not feel the cutoff , the behavior of the velocity will be similar to that in subdiffusion , whereas for large times the behavior will be the classical one with a constant minimal velocity .",
    "the crossover between the two regimes must thus take place at some crossover time @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that in the anomalous domain @xmath25 , and that after this a crossover to normal behavior sets in . in the case",
    "when the normal behavior is described by the fkpp scheme this corresponds to @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the step s length of the corresponding random walk process ( an irrelevant microscopical variable ) , and the time behavior of the velocity in the anomalous regime is given by the equation @xmath29^{1/2 } \\label{eq : vel}\\ ] ]    in order to determine the crossover time we concentrate on the most basic quantity that is known in the normal as well as in the anomalous case , i.e. the number of performed steps , a measure of mobility , which is given by @xmath30 in the normal regime @xmath31 , and @xmath32t_0^\\alpha } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the subdiffusive regime @xmath33 .    by enforcing @xmath34",
    "we find @xmath35 and hence @xmath36 ( more precisely @xmath37 ) .",
    "obviously , the larger we choose the cutoff - parameter @xmath18 , the larger becomes the crossover time . at the time the crossover takes place ,",
    "the quantities characterizing the behavior of the system , such as the number of performed steps , the front velocities etc .",
    "have to match for the two regimes .",
    "tuning @xmath18 we get the respective values of the quantities of interest at @xmath24 , for example the mean waiting time @xmath38 for the normal case in terms of @xmath24 . from eq.([eq : vel ] ) we then get @xmath39 in the subdiffusive regime .",
    "correspondingly we can define other time - dependent effective characteristics in the anomalous regime , e.g. an effective mean waiting time , @xmath40 ( the parameter @xmath24 is changed to @xmath16 ) which yields an effective , time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath41 , from which eq.([vclass ] ) can be obtained via the classical formula @xmath42 .",
    "this discussion elucidates the source of the anomalous front velocity in the regime of small reaction rates , as found numerically in @xcite .",
    "we note that even the case for normal diffusion is not simple at all , especially when the one - dimensional situation is considered , the one especially prone to fluctuation effects .",
    "to understand the situation we first recall that the fkpp equation , if it holds , has the same form in whatever spatial dimension , and provides us not only with the velocity of the front , but also with the front s width . since in any spatial dimension @xmath43 the dimensions of the concentration @xmath44= \\mathrm{l}^{-d}$ ] and that of the reaction rate @xmath45 = t^{-1}[c]^{-1}$ ] are connected to each other , so that @xmath46 $ ] always has the dimension of the inverse time , the combination @xmath47 always has the dimension of velocity , and the combination @xmath48 always has the dimension of length",
    "the characteristic width of the front is thus proportional to our parameter @xmath49 , see @xcite for a quantitative discussion .",
    "the velocity of the front and its width @xmath49 are connected by a simple relation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is of the order of the time which it takes a particle to diffuse through the front s width .",
    "here it is important to note , that the width @xmath49 is the only relevant parameter of the dimension of length in the continuous theory , but going to the particle picture , another characteristic length , the interparticle distance @xmath52 emerges , and an additional dimensionless parameter @xmath53 appears .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 gives us the front width measured in the units of the interparticle distance , and quantifies the strengths of fluctuation effects in the @xmath55 reaction .",
    "according to the buckingham s @xmath54-theorem , the velocity @xmath56 , @xmath57 = \\mathrm{l } \\mathrm{t}^{-1}$ ] has to depend on the parameters of the problem as @xmath58 with @xmath59 being a yet unknown function of a dimensionless parameter , and the prefactor of @xmath59 reproducing the classical fkpp behavior of the velocity .",
    "the prefactor of @xmath59 has the same form in any spatial dimension , while the dimensionless argument of the function @xmath59 has different form in spaces of different dimension .",
    "evidently , the continuous description only works if @xmath60 , i.e. , in the classical case where @xmath61 : for large concentrations and diffusion coefficients and for small reaction rates . in this case",
    "there are many particles within the front region , and the continuous description does hold . for @xmath62 corresponding to the atomically sharp front",
    ", the number of particles across the region fluctuates strongly , and therefore front propagation is fluctuation dominated .",
    "let us now concentrate on the one - dimensional case , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation dominated regime in 1d corresponds to @xmath63 @xcite , which can be easily understood within eq.([vg ] ) by assuming the width of atomically sharp front to correspond to the interparticle distance , @xmath64 . repeating the same crossover arguments , as in the previous case ,",
    "this kind of behavior under normal diffusion is mirrored onto the form @xmath65 for the velocity time dependence in the subdiffusive case .",
    "the same crossover arguments as applied to the velocity , can be also extended to the width of the front .",
    "since the front width @xmath66 is a decaying function of time in the subdiffusive case , the condition for continuous description to hold breaks down for times long enough , and the transition from the intermediate `` classical '' asymptotics , eq.([vclass ] ) , to the final fluctuation - dominated asymptotics eq.([vfd ] ) inevitably takes place .    in what follows",
    "we first show that the `` classical '' asymptotics , eq.([vclass ] ) , indeed appears as a possible solution of the reaction subdiffusion equation , and then we change to investigating the far asymptotic regime , when the reaction - subdiffusion equation breaks down .",
    "this is done by use of extensive numerical simulations .",
    "let us assume the front to behave in accordance with our crossover arguments , namely to have the velocity and the width going as @xmath8 ( i.e. with position @xmath67 ) .",
    "the overall form of the front will be assumed exponential at its leading edge @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the following ansatz is made : @xmath69 = a_0\\exp\\left[-\\lambda_0t^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{2}}z \\right ] , \\label{ansatzfront}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the comoving variable .",
    "( the exponential ansatz is due to the fact that we will anyhow linearize the equations at the front s far edge , and we know from elsewhere @xcite that the ( stationary ) solutions of linear reaction - subdiffusion equations are exponentials . )",

    "we note that neither an ansatz taking a front velocity going as @xmath5 nor an ansatz with @xmath106 and a constant front width yield an asymptotic solution of the reaction - subdiffusion equation , and therefore such types of behavior are impossible within the continuous scheme .    in our previous simulations we were not able to detect the changes in the front shape , presumably due to our averaging procedure over several runs , and hence did not conjecture any change of regime in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our simulations were not carried out for long enough times to detect the change of regime in the velocity variable .",
    "since such transitions take place only very slowly , much longer runs of the simulation were really necessary , as the more extensive simulations of @xcite showed .",
    "this suggests that indeed the continuous regime as considered above does not describe the final behavior of the front .",
    "now we can interpret the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite as the setting in of a slow transition to the fluctuation dominated regime .",
    "since the subdiffusive front is slowing down and becoming steeper in the course of time , any system will sooner or later enter a regime already discussed in @xcite for subdiffusion and in @xcite for normal diffusion .",
    "this regime is a fluctuation dominated one and is no longer described by continuous approaches .",
    "since the integral kernel @xmath107 of the linearized reaction - subdiffusion equations decays and determines the mean density of steps in time , the waiting times for particles at a site become so large in the course of time that the motion of the front is governed by the first @xmath79-particle entering a new site .",
    "all @xmath108-particles at the same site have enough time to react with @xmath79 before the next jump from the site takes place , the reaction rate dependence disappears , and the behavior of the front gets to be the same as in the reaction on the first contact .    under such a condition the velocity of the front s motion can be estimated using the following argument ( adapted from @xcite for our sequential updating scheme ) .",
    "let us consider the front position as fixed by the rightmost a - particle(s ) , and concentrate on the next jump of the front particle .",
    "if the a - particle is alone at its front position , this next jump takes place with probability 1/2 by an amount @xmath109 , so that the net front displacement after such a step is zero on average . on the contrary , if there is more than one particle at the front position ( the probability of which is @xmath110 if the concentration is defined as a number of particles per unit length ) the front moves by @xmath28 to the right , if the particle makes a step forward ( which happens with probability 1/2 ) , and does not move , if it jumps backwards , since then there is at least one other particle , which keeps the front position where it was .",
    "therefore , at a step of a front particle , the front moves on average by a distance @xmath111 . since the rate at which the particle moves is defined by the time - integral of the memory kernel @xmath112 , the front s velocity is given by @xmath113 let us first derive the asymptotic jump rate of the particles . consider the generic waiting time pdfs with the asymptotic behavior @xmath114 the ( cumulative ) probability to make a step until @xmath16 , for @xmath16 large is then @xmath115 or in laplace domain , using the tauberian theorem @xmath116 so that the pdf @xmath117 the rate for a particle to jump is @xmath118 or in laplace domain @xmath119 for @xmath120 so that we have an expression for the velocity in the laplace domain given by @xmath121 transforming back to the time domain yields @xmath122 with @xmath123 the front velocity is better expressed as @xmath124 which corresponds to the position of the front going as @xmath125 ( @xmath126 is the total amount of a - particles ) .",
    "note that the definition of the characteristic waiting time @xmath86 adopted here does not allow for simply taking @xmath127 to perform the limiting transition to normal diffusion , as found e.g. for the exponential distribution of waiting times , @xmath128 .",

    "this effect can not be explained within the mean - field description of the front behavior , but comes into play through the interaction of the particles at the front : the rate at which a front particle performs a jump is higher than the average jump rate of a single particle in the system . if the particle at the edge of the front is subject to a very long waiting time ( which happens not often , but occasionally ) , other particles will outpace that particle and take the lead .",
