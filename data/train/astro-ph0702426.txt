    "before the first neutron star was actually discovered as a radio pulsar by jocelyn bell in 1997 ( hawish et al .",
    "1968 ) , it had been predicted that neutron stars , which are thought to represent the final stage of the stellar evolution , can be powerful sources of thermal x - ray emission just because these elusive objects are to be hot ( chiu & salpeter 1964 , tsuruta 1964 ) , in the literal ( expected surface temperature @xmath2@xmath3 1 mk ) and a figurative sense .",
    "remarkably , this idea and the discovery of the first pulsar became one of motivations for further developing x - ray astronomy started at the end of 50 s of the twentieth century . for objective reasons ,",
    "i am not an expert on the history of x - ray astronomy , but i hope nobody would throw a stone at me for saying that the hunt for thermal emission from neutron stars began with the launch of the _ einstein _ observatory in 1978 . _",
    "einstein _ detected x - ray emission in the 0.24 kev range from a number of neutron stars and neutron star candidates ( mainly as compact sources in supernova remnants [ snrs ] ) . of those ,",
    "the well - known middle - aged radio pulsars b0656 + 14 and b1055 - 52 and the old pulsar b0950 + 08 , which emit thermal x - ray radiation , are discussed in  4 .",
    "the launch of the @xmath1 mission sensitive in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev range opened a `` decade of space science '' in 1990 s and provided a great contribution in observing x - ray emission from neutron stars .",
    "speaking of which , the identification of the @xmath4-ray source geminga as a pulsar and , hence , a neutron star ( halpern & holt 1992 ) is one of the major results achieved with @xmath1 .",
    "those were also supported by observations at energies up to 10 kev with the @xmath5 and beppo@xmath6 x - ray observatories , with the @xmath7 satellite covering the 0.070.2 kev range , as well as with @xmath8 in optical/@xmath9 range . readers interested in more details on results from observations of neutron stars conducted in the last century can find them in the historical review by becker & pavlov ( 2001 ) .",
    "new excellent observational data on neutron stars collected with two currently operating powerful x - ray missions ,  and  ( both launched in 1999 ) , provide a breakthrough in studying emission properties of these enigmatic objects .",
    "i do not know whether anyone has ever accurately counted the total number of _ isolated _",
    "( i.e. , nonaccreting ) neutron stars of different types detected in x - rays , but i believe the number is at least sixty",
    ". results from a significant fraction of these observations have been reviewed by becker & aschenbach ( 2002 ) , pavlov , zavlin & sanwal ( 2002 ) , kaspi , roberts & harding ( 2006 ) , and weisskopf et al .",
    "generally , x - ray radiation from an isolated neutron star can consist of two distinguished components : the nonthermal emission due to the pulsar activity and the radiation originating from the stellar surface .",
    "the nonthermal component is usually described by a power - law spectral model and attributed to radiation produced by synchrotron and/or inverse compton processes in the pulsar magnetosphere , whereas the thermal emission can originate from either the entire surface of a cooling neutron star or small hot spots around the magnetic poles ( polar caps ) on the star surface , or both .",
    "the sketch shown in figure  1 represents an evolutionary picture of these two radiative components expected in x - ray emission of neutron stars . in the majority of very young pulsars ( @xmath10 kyr ) the nonthermal component dominates ( see the left panel in fig .  1 ) , making it virtually impossible to accurately measure the thermal flux ; only upper limits on the surface temperature @xmath2 could be derived , as it was done for the famous crab pulsar ( tennant et al .",
    "2001 ) and psr  j0205 + 6449 in the snr 3c  58 ( slane et al .",
    "2004a ) . as a pulsar becomes older , its nonthermal luminosity decreases ( roughly ) proportional to its spin - down power @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the neutron star moment of inertia , spin period and its derivative , respectively ) , which is thought to drop with the star age @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath174 ( depending on the pulsar magneto - dipole braking index ) . on the other hand , the thermal luminosity of an aging and cooling neutron star decreases slower than the nonthermal one for ages @xmath18100 kyr , up to the end of the neutrino - cooling era ( @xmath10 myr ) .",
    "thus , the thermal radiation from the _ entire _ stellar surface can dominate at soft x - ray energies for _ middle - aged pulsars _ ( @xmath19 kyr ) and some younger pulsars ( @xmath18 kyr ) .",
    "this situation is shown in the middle panel of fig .  1 .",
    "for neutron stars older than about 1 myr , the surface temperature is too low , @xmath20 mk , to detect the thermal radiation from the whole surface in x - rays ; only hot polar caps can be observable . as predicted by virtually all pulsar models , these polar caps can be heated up to x - ray temperatures ( @xmath21 mk ) by relativistic particles generated in pulsar acceleration zones .",
    "a conventional assumption about the polar cap radius is that it is close to the radius within which open magnetic field lines originate from the pulsar surface , @xmath22^{1/2}\\simeq 0.5\\,[p/0.1\\,{\\rm s}]^{-1/2}$ ] km ( for a neutron star radius @xmath23 km ) .",
    "as the spin - down power @xmath24 is the energy source for both nonthermal and thermal polar - cap components , it is hard to predict which of them would prevail in x - ray flux of an old neutron star .",
    "however , it can not be ruled out ( and is proven by observations  see  4.5 ) that the thermal one may be dominant , as indicated in the right panel of fig .  1 .",
    "remarkably , of neutron stars with detected x - ray emission , more than a half reveal thermal radiation .",
    "to interpret these observations , one needs reliable models of neutron star thermal emission .",
    "this paper reviews theoretical and observational aspects of studying thermal radiation from neutron stars .",
    "there are a few questions to be answered before immersing into details on the theoretical modeling of neutron star thermal emission .",
    "the main question is why studying the thermal emission is needed and interesting . shortly , comparing observed thermal spectrum of a neutron star with theoretical models can allow one to infer the surface effective temperature @xmath25 and total bolometric flux @xmath26 ( redshifted quantities , i.e. , as measured by a distant observer ) and estimate the actual ( unredshifted ) parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29^{1/2}$ ] is the gravitational redshift determined by the neutron star mass @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 .",
    "if the distance to the neutron star , @xmath32 , is known , then the measured temperature and flux yield the apparent ( redshifted ) radius of the star    @xmath33^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "this in turn links the actual neutron star radius and mass to each other via the relation @xmath35 , or    @xmath36\\,\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    as seen in figure  2 , the latter puts constraints on equation of state of the superdense neutron star matter .",
    "moreover , if one manages to measure the gravitational redshift of a neutron star , for example , via detecting and identifying spectral features in its x - ray flux , then it yields a unique solution for the neutron star mass and radius , and  bingo !  the long - sought equation of state of the neutron star inner matter is found and the ultimate goal of the neutron star physics is achieved ! ( un)fortunately , the real life is more complicated than it may seem . anyway , even although solving the neutron star mystery seems to be far away , investigating thermal emission from these objects of different ages can trace their thermal evolution , that in turn sheds light on internal composition and nucleon superfluidity of the superdense matter ( see yakovlev et al .",
    "2005 for a review ) .",
    "in addition , inferring surface properties of a neutron star ( temperature , magnetic field , chemical composition ) tells about its formation and interaction with environment .",
    "like in usual stars , thermal radiation of neutron stars is formed in the superficial ( surface ) layers .",
    "hence , the next question is about the state of the neutron star surface . in principle",
    ", it can be in the gaseous state ( atmosphere ) or in a condensed state ( liquid or solid ) , depending on surface temperature , magnetic field @xmath37 and chemical composition .",
    "for instance , according to the estimates by lai & salpeter ( 1997 ) , hydrogen is condensed in surface layers if @xmath20 mk at @xmath38 g and @xmath39 mk at @xmath40 g. at higher temperatures and/or lower magnetic fields , hydrogen does not condensate and forms an atmosphere .",
    "as the majority of known neutron stars seem to possess surface magnetic fields of @xmath4110@xmath42 g or less , they are expected to have an atmosphere .",
    "therefore , below i mainly discuss properties of neutron star atmospheres .",
    "the chemical composition affects not only the state of the surface , but it also determines the properties of emitted radiation . what would the composition of the stellar surface be ? in case of neutron stars , one can expect that the emitting layers are comprised of just one , lightest available , chemical element because heavier elements sink into deeper layers due to the immense neutron star gravitation ( alcock & illarionov 1980 ) .",
    "for instance , even a small amount of hydrogen , with a surface density of @xmath43 g @xmath44 , is sufficient for the radiation to be indistinguishable from that emitted from a purely hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "such an amount of hydrogen , @xmath45 , can be delivered onto the neutron star surface by , e.g. , ( weak ) accretion from the interstellar medium during the neutron star life and/or fallback of a fraction of the envelope ejected during the supernova explosion .",
    "if no hydrogen is present at the surface ( e.g. , because of diffuse nuclear burning  see chang & bildsten 2004 ) , a heavier chemical element is responsible for the radiative properties of the neutron star atmosphere",
    ". however , a mixture of elements can be observed in the emitting layers if a neutron star is experiencing accretion with such a rate that the accreting matter is supplied faster than the gravitational separation occurs .",
    "what else makes neutron star atmospheres very special ?",
    "it is of course the enormous gravity at the neutron star surface , with typical gravitational acceleration @xmath46 - 10@xmath47 cm s@xmath48 , and very strong , even huge , surface magnetic fields .",
    "the gravity makes the atmospheres very thin , with a typical thickness @xmath49\\sim 0.1$]-10 cm ( @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath51 is proton mass ) , and dense , @xmath52 - 10@xmath53 g @xmath54 .",
    "such a high density causes strong nonideality effects ( pressure ionization , smoothed spectral features ) which must be taken into account ( e.g. , pavlov et al . 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the strong gravitational field bends the photon trajectories near the neutron star surface ( pechenick , ftaclas & cohen 1983 ) , as illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "this effect depends on the gravitational parameter @xmath55 , and it can even make the whole surface visible if the neutron star is massive enough , @xmath56<[m / m_\\odot]<2.25\\,[10\\,{\\rm km}/r]$ ] . in particular , the gravitational bending strongly affects the observed pulsations of thermal emission ( zavlin , shibanov & pavlov 1995 ) . as shown by pavlov & zavlin ( 1997 ) and zavlin & pavlov ( 1998 , 2004a ) , analyzing pulsed thermal radiation can put constraints on the mass - to - radius ratio , @xmath57 , and the neutron star geometry ( orientation of spin and magnetic axes with respect to each other and direction to a distant observer  see fig .  3 ) .",
    "huge magnetic fields , up to @xmath58 g , expected in the surface layers of neutron stars change the properties of the atmospheric matter and the emergent radiation very drastically .",
    "strongly magnetized atmospheres are essentially anisotropic , with radiative opacities depending on the magnetic field and the direction and polarization of radiation .",
    "moreover , since the ratio of the cyclotron energy , @xmath59 , to the coulomb energy is very large ( e.g. , @xmath60 = 850\\ , [ b/10^{12}\\ , { \\rm g}]$ ] for a hydrogen atom ) , the structure of atoms is strongly distorted by the magnetic field .",
    "for instance , the binding ( ionization ) energies of atoms are increased by a factor of @xmath61 ( e.g. , the ionization potential of a hydrogen atom is about 0.3 kev at @xmath62 g ) .",
    "this in turn significantly modifies ionization equilibrium of the neutron star atmospheric plasma .",
    "another important effect is that the heat conductivity of the neutron star crust is anisotropic , being higher along the magnetic field .",
    "this results in a nonuniform surface temperature distribution ( greenstein & hartke 1983 ) , which leads to pulsations of the thermal radiation due to neutron star rotation .    depending on the magnetic field strength ,",
    "models of neutron star atmospheres are differentiated in two groups , `` nonmagnetic '' and `` strongly magnetized '' .",
    "the nonmagnetic models are constructed for @xmath63 g , when the electron cyclotron energy , @xmath64 kev , is lower than the binding energy of atoms and thermal energy of particles , @xmath65 . as a result ,",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the radiative opacities and emitted spectra is negligible at x - ray energies , @xmath66 kev .",
    "these models , constructed assuming @xmath67 g , can be applicable to , for example , millisecond pulsars and neutron star transients in quiescence ( e.g. , rutledge et al . 1999 , 2001a , b and 2002 ) , whereas magnetized models are intended mostly for radio pulsar with @xmath4110@xmath68 g. below i summarize main results obtained from these two groups of neutron star atmosphere models .",
    "more details can be found in the extended review by zavlin & pavlov ( 2002 ) .",
    "modeling nonmagnetic neutron star atmospheres was started in the pioneering work by romani ( 1987 ) . since then , models for various surface chemical compositions have been developed by rajagopal & romani ( 1996 ) , zavlin , pavlov & shibanov ( 1996 ) , zavlin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , werner & deetjen ( 2000 ) , pavlov & zavlin ( 2000a ) , pons et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , gnsicke , braje & romani ( 2002 ) , and heinke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the general approach of the atmosphere modeling is as follows .",
    "very small thickness of a neutron star atmosphere , @xmath69 km (  3.2 ) , allows one to use the plane - parallel ( one - dimensional ) approximation . in addition , because of rather high densities of the surface layers , the atmospheres are expected to be in the local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the atmosphere modeling involves solving three main equations .",
    "the first one is the radiative transfer equation for the specific spectral intensity @xmath70 ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is photon frequency , @xmath73 is cosine of the angle @xmath74 between the normal to the surface and the wave - vector of outgoing radiation , @xmath75 is the column density ( @xmath76 , with @xmath77 being the geometrical depth ) , @xmath78 is the total radiative opacity which includes the absorption , @xmath79 , and scattering , @xmath80 , opacities , @xmath81 is the source function , @xmath82 is the mean spectral intensity , and @xmath83 is the planck function .",
    "the boundary condition for this equation is @xmath84 for @xmath85 at @xmath86 , assuming no incident radiation at the surface ( valid at @xmath87  see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the atmospheres are supposed to be in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the first condition implies that the total energy flux through the atmosphere is constant and transferred solely by radiation ( electron heat conduction and convection are of no imortance for typical parameters of interest ) , @xmath88 the second condition means that the atmospheric pressure is @xmath89 ( the radiative force is insignificant unless @xmath90 mk ) . finally , these three equations are supplemented with the equation of state for the atmospheric plasma and equations of ionization equilibrium .",
    "the latter is needed for computing the electron number density and the fractions of ions in different stages of ionization to obtain the radiative opacity with account for free - free , bound - free and bound - bound transitions .",
    "the main results of the atmosphere modeling are the properties of the emergent radiation demonstrated in figure  4 .",
    "the left panel of fig .  4 presents the spectral fluxes of emergent radiation at a local surface point , @xmath91 ( at @xmath86 ) , for several effective temperatures and chemical compositions ( pure hydrogen , helium , and iron ) , together with blackbody spectra at the same values of @xmath92 .",
    "the atmosphere model spectra differ substantially from the blackbody ones , particularly in high - energy tails of the radiation from the light - element ( hydrogen and helium ) atmospheres .",
    "the reason is in the combination of two effects : rapid decrease of the light - element opacities with energy , @xmath93 , and temperature growth in the surface layers , @xmath94 , with depth @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the high - energy radiation is formed in deeper and hotter layers , with @xmath95 .",
    "the spectra emitted from the heavy - element atmospheres ( see also zavlin & pavlov 2002 for spectra of solar - mixture compositions ) exhibit numerous spectral lines and photoionization edges ( e.g. , m , l , and k spectral complexes in the iron spectra , at about 0.1 , 0.8 , and 7.1 kev , respectively ) produced by ions in various ionization stages . generally , they are closer to the blackbody radiation because the energy dependence of the heavy - element opacities is , on average , flatter than that for the light elements .",
    "although the opacity of the atmospheric plasma is isotropic in the nonmagnetic case , the emitted radiation show substantial anisotropy , i.  e. , the specific intensity @xmath70 depends on the direction of emission due to the limb - darkening effect ( see the right panel in fig .",
    "4 ) : the larger angle @xmath74 between the normal to the surface and direction of a specific intensity is , the longer path throughout the surface layers emerging photons travel to escape , and , hence , the stronger absorption the intensity undergoes .",
    "the anisotropy depends on photon energy and chemical composition of the atmosphere .",
    "this effect should be taken into account to model thermal radiation from a nonuniform neutron star surface .",
    "the emergent radiation depends also on the surface gravity : a stronger gravitational acceleration increases the density of the atmospheric plasma , changes temperature run @xmath94 and enhances the nonideality effects , which results in weaker ( more smoothed ) spectral features .",
    "the hardness of the spectral wien tail at higher photon energies also alters with varying surface gravity because of the changes in the atmosphere structure ( zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 , heine et al .",
    "however , these effects are rather subtle and may be imortant only for analyzing observational data of extremely good statistics .",
    "first magnetized hydrogen models have been developed by shibanov et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , pavlov et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , shibanov & zavlin ( 1995 ) , pavlov et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and zavlin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) these models used simplified radiative opacities of strongly magnetized , partially ionized plasma , which did not include the bound - bound transitions .",
    "however , they are considered to be reliable enough in the case of high temperatures , @xmath96 mk , at typical pulsar fields , @xmath97 g , when the atmospheric plasma is almost fully ionized even in the strong magnetized fields .",
    "later on , completely ionized hydrogen models for superstrong magnetic fields , @xmath58@xmath98 g , have been presented in a number of papers ( bezchastnov et al .  1996 , zel 2001 , ho & lai 2001 , zane et al .  2001 , ho & lai 2003 ) , concerned mainly with the vacuum polarization effects first discussed by pavlov & gnedin ( 1984 ) and the proton cyclotron lines whose",
    "energies shift into the x - ray band at @xmath99 g. ho et al .",
    "( 2003 ) presented models for partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres with magnetic fields up to @xmath100 g and effective temperatures down to about 0.5 mk .",
    "this work showed that the vacuum polarization affects not only the proton cyclotron line but also it supresses spectral features caused by bound species , making them virtually unobservable in thermal spectra of strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "first set of magnetized atmospheres with a heavy - element composition ( pure iron ) was constructed by rajagopal , romani & miller ( 1997 ) , with the use of a rather crude approximations for the very complicated properties of iron ions in strong magnetic fields .",
    "recently , a next step in modeling magnetized heavy - element ( carbon , oxygen , neon ) atmospheres with @xmath10110@xmath102 g and @xmath1035 ) mk has been undertaken by mori & ho ( 2006 ) .",
    "these models imply latest developments in atomic physics and radiative opacities in strong magnetic fields ( mori & hailey 2002 , 2006 ) . like in the nonmagnetic case",
    ", the magnetized heavy - element atmosphere emission shows many prominent spectral features which , if observed in real x - ray observational data , could be very useful to measure the neutron star magnetic field and mass - to - radius ratio , @xmath57 .",
    "all the above - mentioned works used the same approach for constructing magnetized atmosphere models , which is generally similar to the nonmagnetic case .",
    "the main difference is that the atmospheric radiation is polarized , and the radiative opacities depend on the polarization and direction of radiation .",
    "gnedin & pavlov ( 1974 ) described the radiative transfer in a strongly magnetized plasma in terms of coupled equations for specific intensities of two normal modes , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with different polarizations and opacities :      to deal with the problems caused by the sharp angular dependence of the radiative opacities ( kaminker , pavlov & shibanov 1982 ) , a two - step method for modeling of magnetic neutron star atmospheres was developed ( pavlov et al .",
    "1994 ; shibanov & zavlin 1995 ) . at the first step ,",
    "the radiative transfer is solved in the diffusion approximation for the mean intensities @xmath116 : @xmath117 + \\bar{\\sigma}_\\nu\\left[j_{\\nu , j}-j_{\\nu,3-j}\\right]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the angle - averaged absorption and scattering opacities .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath120 , with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "next , the atmospheric structure obtained at the first step is corrected using an iterative procedure applied to the exact equations of the radiative transfer . finally , the emergent intensity ( at @xmath86 ) is @xmath123\\ , \\exp\\left[-\\nu^{-1}\\,\\int_0^y\\,k_{\\mu , j}\\,{\\rm d}z\\right]\\,{\\rm d}y\\,,\\ ] ] and the emitted spectral flux is computed as @xmath124 .",
    "more details on the modeling of magnetized atmospheres can be found in pavlov et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "figure  5 ( left panel ) shows polarization - summed spectral fluxes of the emergent radiation , @xmath125 , emitted by a local element of the neutron star surface , for two values of effective temperature and two magnetic field orientations , perpendicular and parallel to the surface ( @xmath126 and 1 , respectively ) .",
    "the main result is that the magnetized atmosphere spectra are harder than the blackbody radiation of the same @xmath92 , although they are softer than the nonmagnetic spectra . similar to the nonmagnetic case ,",
    "this is explained by the temperature growth with depth and the opacity decrease at higher energies , which is more gradual ( @xmath127 for the mode with smaller opacity ) in the magnetized plasam . at lower effective temperatures ,",
    "@xmath128 mk , the photoionization opacity ( due to bound - free transitions ) becomes important , that affects the shape of emitted spectra ( see the example with @xmath129 in fig .  5 ) .",
    "the proton cyclotron lines are seen at energies @xmath130 ev .",
    "if the magnetic field is very large , @xmath131 g , the proton cyclotron line shifts into the x - ray band . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetic field is not so large , @xmath132@xmath133 g , the neutron star atmosphere spectra may exhibit the electron cyclotron lines in the x - ray band , at @xmath134 kev .",
    "calculations of hydrogen atmosphere models which include bound - bound transitions ( zavlin & pavlov 2002 , ho et al .",
    "2003 ) show that spectral lines , considerably broadened by the motional stark effect ( pavlov & mszros 1993 , pavlov & potekhin 1995 ) may emerge at @xmath135 mk .",
    "the strongest line corresponds to the transition between the ground state and the lowest excited state ; its energy is @xmath136 $ ] ev .    radiation emerging from a magnetized atmosphere is strongly anisotropic .",
    "angular dependences of the local specific intensities , @xmath137 ( eq .  [ 7 ] ) , show a complicated `` pencil - plus - fan '' structure  a narrow peak along the direction of the magnetic field ( where the atmospheric plasma is most transparent for the radiation ) , and a broader peak at intermediate angles .",
    "the widths and strengths of the peaks depend on magnetic field and photon energy ( see examples in the right panel of fig .  5 ) .",
    "obviously , it is very important to account for this anisotropy while modeling the radiation from a neutron star with nonuniform surface magnetic field and effective temperature .",
    "results presented in   3.3 and 3.4 describe spectral radiation emitted by a _ local _ element at the neutron star surface .",
    "the effective temperature and/or magnetic field distributions over the surface can be nonuniform ( for example , if a neutron star has a dipole magnetic field , the effective temperature decreases from the magnetic poles to the equator ) . to calculate the _ total _ emission",
    ", one has to integrate the local intensities , computed for local temperatures and magnetic fields , over the visible part of the surface @xmath138 , with account for the gravitational redshift and bending of photon trajectories :    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the observed ( redshifted ) photon energy . to take into account the interstellar absorption , a factor , @xmath141 $ ] ,",
    "should be added in eq .",
    "( 8) ( @xmath142 $ ] is the absorption cross section per hydrogen atom ) .",
    "more details about the integration over the neutron star surface can be found in pavlov & zavlin ( 2000b ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that if a neutron star has a nonuniform distribution of the magnetic field , the integration broadens the spectral features .",
    "in addition , if a neutron star is a fast rotator , one should take into account the doppler shifts of energies of photons emitted from surface elements moving with different radial velocities .",
    "maximum values of these velocities , @xmath143 ( @xmath144 is the inclination of the rotation axis with respect to observer s line of sight  see fig .",
    "3 ) , can be as high as 10%15% of the speed of light for millisecond periods .",
    "for instance , zavlin & pavlov ( 2002 ) showed that a fast rotation , @xmath145 ms , may lead to complete smearing of weak and narrow spectral lines , provided @xmath146 is large enough , leaving only most prominent spectral jumps around the strongest photoionization edges .",
    "if thermal radiation originated from small polar caps on the neutron star surface , it greatly simplifies eq .",
    "( 8) : @xmath147 where the apparent spot area @xmath148 and the angle @xmath149 between the wave - vector of escaping radiation and the radius - vector to the hot spot are computed with account for the effect of gravitational bending .",
    "these quantities depend on the angles @xmath150 ( between the rotational and magnetic axes ) and @xmath144 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and the gravitational parameter @xmath55 ( see zavlin , shibanov & pavlov 1995 for details ) .    the flux given by eqs .",
    "( 7 ) or ( 8) varies with the period of neutron star rotation .",
    "one can obtain a large variety of pulse profiles at different assumptions on the angles @xmath150 and @xmath144 and the neutron star mass - to - radius ratio .",
    "examples of pulse profiles computed for radiation from the entire neutron star surface are shown in zavlin & pavlov ( 2002 ) , whereas pulse profiles of thermal radiation from heated polar caps are presented by zavlin , shibanov & pavlov ( 1995 ) and zavlin & pavlov ( 2004a ) for magnetized atmosphere models , and by zavlin & pavlov ( 1998 ) for nonmagnetic ones .",
    "although the model atmosphere spectra are different from the blackbody radiation , very often an observed thermal spectrum can be fitted equally well with the blackbody and neutron star atmosphere models ( see examples in  4 ) , particularly when the energy resolution is low and/or the energy band is narrow and/or observational data are of a poor quality . however , the parameters obtained from such fits are quite different , especially when the hydrogen or helium atmospheres are used .",
    "since the light - element atmosphere spectra are much harder than the blackbody spectra at the same effective temperature , atmosphere model fits result in temperatures @xmath151 significantly lower than the blackbody temperature @xmath152 , with a typical ratio @xmath1533 . on the other hand , to provide the same total energy flux , the blackbody fit yields a smaller normalization factor , proportional to @xmath154 ( see eq .  [ 7 ] ) , than the atmosphere model fit does . in other words ,",

    "it is also worth to remember that blackbody radiation is _ isotropic _ and , hence , it results in weak pulsations of model flux , with a typical pulsed fraction around a few percents only .    finally , the atmosphere models discussed here , both nonmagnetic and magnetized , are available for analyzing thermal x - ray emission observed from neutron stars as a part of the x - ray spectral fitting package ( codes ` nsa ' and ` nsagrav ' in xspec ) provided by the nasa s high energy astrophysics science archive reserach center .      as mentioned above ,",

    "these works showed that the overall spectral shape of x - ray flux emitted by a condensed surface is mostly featureless ( only weak spectral features associated with ion cyclotron and electron plasma frequencies can appear in some cases ) and fairly close to blackbody spectrum of the same temperature .",
    "the main difference between these two model spectra is that , because of suppressed emissivity of condensed surface , the surface radiation is reduced from the blackbody one by a factor of a few .",

    "interprets the thermal flux as emitted from the whole neutron surface of @xmath311 mk and radius @xmath23 km ( for a distance @xmath312 kpc ) , with @xmath313 ergs s@xmath164 , and yields the nonthermal spectrum of @xmath314 with @xmath195 ergs s@xmath164 , about 15 times smaller than the thermal luminosity .",
    "the spectrum of j0617 fitted with this two - component model is presented in figure  13 .",
    "it should be noted that , like in the case of vela , using blackbody radiation instead of atmosphere models results in much steeper power - law component of @xmath194 , that is not typical for nonthermal emission from radio pulsars . hence , the interpretation involving the atmosphere models can be regarded as more preferable .",
    "another putative pulsar with a possible @xmath4-ray counterpart powering an x - ray nebula is the compact source j0007 at the center of the snr cta  1 ( but not a cco discussed in  4.8 ) . as obtained by slane et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , its x - ray spectrum detected with  is well fitted with a magnetized hydrogen atmosphere model of the same parameters as those derived for j0617 ( assuming @xmath315 kpc ) , plus a power - law component of @xmath316 and @xmath317 ergs s@xmath164 .",
    "extrapolation of this power - law spectrum to high energies is consistent with the flux detected from the proposed @xmath4-ray counterpart , strengthening the proposition that j0007 is a @xmath4-ray emitting pulsar .",
    "all objects presented in   4.14.7 are either radio pulsars or show other manifestations of the nonthermal activity .",
    "below i briefly discuss a few examples of radio - quiet neutron stars emitting only thermal x - ray emission .",
    "1e1207 belongs to the small group of currently known seven ccos in snrs ( see pavlov , sanwal & teter 2004 for a review ) .",
    "one of them , the cco in the snr rcw  103 , is very outstanding because it shows a highly variable x - ray flux and its emission is presumably powered by accretion from a companion in a close binary system with a @xmath318-hr orbital period .",
    "the other six ccos have not shown any long - term variability of their thermal emission , characterized by blackbody temperatures @xmath3195 mk and emitting areas @xmath3203 km , and seem to be similar to each other . however , the spin periods of two objects , 1e1207 in the snr pks  120951/52 with @xmath321 s ( zavlin et al . 2000 ) and cxou  j185238.6 + 004020 in the snr kes  79 with @xmath322 s ( gotthelf , halpern & seward 2005 ) , make them distinct from the rest .",
    "1e1207 is even more unique : it is the only known nonaccreting neutron star whose x - ray flux contains two firmly detected spectral features .",
    "figure  14 presents the spectrum of 1e1207 with two absorption lines at about 0.7 and 1.4 kev discovered with ( sanwal et al .",
    "these features can not be explained as proton or electron cyclotron lines , and current interpretations involve atomic transitions of once - ionized helium in a very strong magnetic field , @xmath58 g ( sanwal et al .",
    "2002 ; pavlov & bezchastnov 2005 ) , or transitions of helium - like oxygen ( or neon ) in a weaker field @xmath323 g ( mori & hailey 2002 ) .",
    "first magnetized oxygen atmosphere models of mori & ho ( 20006 ) seem to be in apparent qualitative agreement with the x - ray spectrum of 1e1207 , although it has to be demonstrated yet whether these models could explain the observational data in the quantitative way . in any case , regardless of what the true origin of these spectral lines is , they make 1e1207 one of the most important objects for astrophysics of neutron stars and physics of superdense matter because it provides an opportunity to measure the gravitational redshift at the neutron star surface and constrain the equation of state of the superdense matter in the neutron star interiors .",
    "the final part of the observational section gives a short description of another small group of very intriguing objects  so - called `` dim '' or `` truly isolated '' neutron stars .",
    "these objects , seven in total , were discovered with @xmath1 , and a lot of important information on properties of their x - ray emission provided with  and  is summurized in the detailed reviews by haberl ( 2007 ) and van kerkwijk & kaplan ( 2007 ) .",
    "all seven emit thermal x - ray spectra characterized by temperatures @xmath3241.1 mk .",
    "faint optical counterparts ( with magnitudes @xmath325 ) were identified for five of them .",
    "four objects have periods in the 3.511.4 s range , and spin period candidates in the same range have been proposed for the other three .",
    "all this strongly suggests that these objects are neutron stars ( and i believe nobody doubts this ) .",
    "extrapolations of the observed x - ray spectra fitted with a blackbody spectrum to optical strongly underpredict measured optical fluxes ( where available ; see pavlov , zavlin & sanwal 2002 for examples ) .",
    "none of current neutron star atmosphere models applied to the x - ray spectra of these objects either fits or yields reasonable parameters ( generally , the atmosphere models result in unrealistic estimates on the neutron stars size , that in turn leads to a large overestimate of observed optical fluxes  see pavlov et al .",
    "timing solutions ( spin period derivatives ) determined for two objects yield very similar estimates on the stars age , @xmath326 myr , spin - down power , @xmath327 ergs s@xmath48 , and surface magnetic field , @xmath328 g. the low estimates derived on @xmath24 can explain the absence of nonthermal activity of these two ( and , by analogy , all other five ) neutron stars .",
    "broad absorption features centered at energies in the 0.30.8 kev range have been detected in the radiation of six objects , whereas the seventh one reveals almost a `` perfect '' blackbody spectrum ( pavlov , zavlin & sanwal 2002 ) .",
    "what produces the absorption features in the x - ray spectra of six objects is a matter of debate : they might be caused by proton cyclotron resonance in a magnetic field @xmath329 g or produced by atomic transitions in , for example , a strongly magnetized hydrogen surface ( if it is in the gaseous state ) . any of these hypotheses should be taken with caution until reliable models of surface emission are proposed for these neutron stars . in this respect ,",
    "the model by prez - azorin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) invoking emission from a nonuniform , strongly magnetized and condensed neutron star surface seems to be the most advanced and self - consistent approach to explain emission properties of thse objects .",
    "there are other intriguing details on properties of these objects ( e.g. , a long - term variability of the spectral shape of x - ray flux detected from one of them , presumably cased by a neutron star precession ) that can be found in the above - mentioned reviews .",
    "i would like to complete this review with a brief discussion on what has been learned during the extensive , 15-year - long studying of thermal emission from isolated neutron stars .",
    "undoubtedly , a substantial progress has been made on the theoretical front .",
    "best investigated models are nonmagnetic atmospheres of various chemical compositions and magnetized fully - ionized hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "these models have been successfully applied to interpretation of thermal emission to a number of neutron stars , mainly , radio pulsars of different ages , including millisecond pulsars , and yielded reasonable neutron star parameters ( surface temperatures and radii of emitting areas ) .",
    "besides the active pulsars , there is a group of neutron stars transiently accreting in x - ray binaries ( e.g. , aquila  x-1 , ks  1731260 , centaurus  x4 , 4u  1608522 , mxb  165929 , 4u  2129 + 47 ) whose x - ray emission in quiescence has been analyzed with use of the atmosphere models ( rutledge et al .",
    "1999 , 2001a , b and 2002 , nowak , heinz & begelman 2002 , wijnands et al . 2002 and 2003 , heinke et al .",
    "although these objects are not isolated , their quiescent radiation is interpreted as emitted from the whole neutron stars surface covered with a nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere heated by energy released in pycnonuclear reactions of the compressed accreted material .",
    "importantly , based on the results obtained on the thermal emission from these objects , yakovlev , levenfish & haensel ( 2003 ) proposed a new method for studying neutron stars internal structure and equation of state of the inner matter .",
    "in addition , as suggested by rutledge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the atmosphere models can be useful for distinguishing between transiently accreting neutron stars and black holes , in quiescence .",
    "first steps have been undertaken in modeling partially ionized atmosphere models with strong magnetic fields and different chemical compositions , as well as in modeling thermal emission from condensed neutron star surfaces , although both these types of models are still awaiting application to observational data .    despite a lot of interesting and encouraging results obtained in the thermal emission modeling and with applying these models to observational data , a number of problems remains to be solved .",
    "first of all , the approach based on two polarization modes currently used in magnetized atmosphere models is in fact inaccurate and inapplicable for a partially ionized plasma . to construct more advanced models ,",
    "the problem of radiative transfer in strongly magnetized plasmas should be solved in terms of the four stokes parameters , with use of the polarizability tensor constructed with aid of the kramers - kronig relations ( bulik & pavlov 1995 , potekhin et al .",
    "next , investigations of the structure of various atoms , molecules , and molecular chains in strong magnetic fields , as well as radiative transitions in these species ( pavlov 1998 ) , are necessary to construct , in combination with the advanced radiative transfer approach , magnetized atmosphere models of a next generation for different chemical compositions . very interesting and important are the ( virtually unknown ) radiative properties of matter in superstrong magnetic fields , @xmath131 g , apparently found in axps and sgrs .",
    "more reliable models are required for radiative properties of nonideal plasmas and condensed matter , as well as further investigations of phase transitions between different states of matter in strong magnetic fields .",
    "not only the models of neutron star atmospheres and condensed surfaces require improvements .",
    "analysis of observational data on thermal flux from neutron stars , especially temporal behavior of detected x - ray emission , shows that the idealized picture of a neutron star with a centered magnetic dipole and uniform surface temperature is oversimplification .",
    "therefore , future computations of thermal emission from a neutron star applied to observational data should use realistic surface temperature distributions to reproduce _ both spectral and temporal _ properties of observed emission .",
    "in particular , the problem of temperature distribution over heated polar caps of millisecond pulsars is of a special importance because modeling pulsed thermal emission from these objects is a promising way to constrain neutron star mass - to radius ratio .",
    "for that , more elaborated models of magnetospheric pulsed emission are required to disentangle nonthermal and thermal components .    confronting the surface temperatures derived from observation data with theoretical models of neutron star thermal evolution ( yakovlev et al .",
    "2005 ) indicates that the neutron star interiors are most probably superfluid and that these objects may have different masses ( e.g. , @xmath330 for vela and geminga , and @xmath331 for psr  b105552 ) .",
    "but these results are are quite uncertain because , first of all , they are based on the assumption that the characteristic age of a neutron star is its true age ( see the example of psr  j0538 + 2817 in  4.3 ) .",
    "next , more importantly , thermal emission mechanisms operating in neutron stars are not completely understood yet , especially in colder objects .",
    "only rather simple conclusions could be drawn from the obtained results .",
    "it looks plausible that younger and hotter objects ( this @xmath332 kyr and @xmath333 mk ) are indeed covered with a gaseous atmosphere , strongly ionized if comprised of hydrogen , as suggested by the examples discussed in   4.14.3 and ( probably ) 4.7 .",
    "to explain why the simple blackbody model fits well thermal radiation from colder neutron stars with strong magnetic fields , whereas atmosphere models do not provide reasonable parameters (  4.4 ) , one may suggest that cooling hydrogen - depleted neutron star envelopes undergo a phase transition , forming a condensed surface .",
    "but this assumption is challenged by very complicated temporal behavior of the thermal flux detected from many these objects  it can be hardly explained without invoking a strong anisotropy of surface radiation similar to that characteristic to the atmospheric radiation .",
    "therefore , the parameters inferred from the blackbody spectral fits should be taken with caution .",
    "it also concerns the two - blackbody ( `` soft '' and `` hard '' ) model suggested for the thermal phase - integrated spectra of the middle - aged pulsars (  4.4 ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the harder thermal component is real or it emerges because the simplified spectral models were used ( e.g. , this component is not required in the interpretation involving a power - law spectrum with a phase - dependent photon index  see jackson & halpern 2006 ) .",
    "there are even much more unanswered questions related to thermal radiation of neutron stars ( concerning , for example , the nature of ccos and connection between them and orther types of neutron stars , the origin of spectral lines in thermal emission of seven objects and why no features are present in spectra of other neutron stars with similar temperatures and magnetic field , etc . ) to answer these questions , not only improved models are necessary but also a larger sample of neutron stars of various types observed in different energy ranges , from optical / uv to x - rays , is required . in particular , as shown by kargaltsev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and kargaltsev & pavlov ( 2007 ) , the @xmath254 range is very important for elucidating properties of thermal emission emerging from the whole neutron star surface .",
    "contrary to the x - ray ( wien ) part of the thermal emission whose shape is strongly affected by surface chemical composition and temperature inhomogeneties , the @xmath254 ( rayleigh - jeans ) tail , proportional to the product @xmath334 $ ] , can put tight constraints on the surface temperature . hopefully ( `` the hope dies last '' ) enough observational time will be allocated in future for studying these enigmatic objects , neutron stars .",
