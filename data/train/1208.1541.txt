    "although the mnls equation appears to be a perturbation of the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation , there is a sense in which it can also be considered to be a perturbation of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this is related to broken galilean symmetry introduced for @xmath5 , which also shows that the mnls equation can be reduced to the so - called derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation of kaup and newell @xcite .",
    "the complete integrability of the mnls equation is connected with its representation as the compatibility condition of a lax pair based on the wki spectral problem of wadati , konno , and ichikawa @xcite .",
    "the existence of a lax pair representation makes it possible to analyze quite general solutions of the mnls equation with remarkable accuracy ; as an example , see the long - time asymptotic analysis of kitaev and vartanian @xcite .",

    "this limit is obviously very singular , but the problem can be recast in a form that appears somewhat more tractable by introducing madelung s fluid dynamical variables @xcite : @xmath13 here of course @xmath14 is defined ( assuming @xmath15 is non - vanishing ) by continuation to be a differentiable function of @xmath0 .",
    "the initial values of these fields are independent of @xmath1 , since according to , @xmath16 most of what we will discuss in this paper has to do with quite special choices for the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . however , to ensure the validity of certain general asymptotic formulae for scattering data ( see and ) , we assume that the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are schwartz - class real - analytic functions of @xmath19 , and that @xmath17 is nowhere vanishing .",

    "although this seems attractive , proving that such a procedure yields an accurate approximation when @xmath31 is not at all straightforward for several reasons .",
    "perhaps the greatest obstruction lies in the fact that the dispersionless mnls system is not strictly hyperbolic , leading to a certain ill - posedness of the @xmath1-independent cauchy initial value problem purported to approximate the true dynamics .",
    "this means that without strong assumptions on the initial data , there may exist no corresponding solution of at all . even if there is a solution , linearization about a constant state reveals unbounded exponential growth rates corresponding to modes that are likely to be seeded by the dispersive correction term",

    "the characteristic velocities of the dispersionless mnls system satisfy a quadratic equation with real coefficients depending on the local values of the madelung variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the discriminant of this quadratic is proportional via a positive factor to @xmath36 at any given @xmath37 the fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 can cause the system to be in any one of three different states ( with terminology borrowed from the language of stationary flows in gas dynamics ) :    * _ globally supersonic_. in this case the dispersionless mnls system is strictly hyperbolic , corresponding to @xmath40 and hence real distinct characteristic velocities , for all @xmath19 .",

    "while the correspondence is not the obvious one , it is shown in @xcite that for initial data that makes the dispersionless mnls system globally supersonic ( respectively subsonic ) at @xmath43 , the semiclassical analysis of the mnls cauchy problem can essentially be reduced to that of the defocusing ( respectively focusing ) cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this result generalizes to arbitrary genus a fact that was found for genus zero in @xcite and for genus one in @xcite",

    "this observation is the key motivation for the study that we begin in this paper . _    to analyze the solution of the mnls equation subject to suitable initial data of the form by means of the inverse - scattering transform",
    ", one must in general study the small-@xmath1 asymptotics of two types of problems :    * the direct scattering problem .",
    "this amounts to the asymptotic analysis of a singularly perturbed linear differential equation ( the wki spectral problem ) .",
    "the natural tools applicable to this problem include the classical wkb method and its generalizations . * the inverse scattering problem .",
    "this can be formulated as a matrix riemann - hilbert problem ( see  [ sec : rhp ] ) with a highly oscillatory or rapidly exponentially growing and decaying jump matrix .",
    "the natural tools applicable to this problem include the noncommutative steepest descent method of deift and zhou @xcite and its generalizations ( in particular the mechanism of the so - called _ @xmath44-function _ first introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "although the asymptotic analysis of the direct scattering problem can be carried out in part using classical methods , what really makes the problem difficult is ( i ) that one requires asymptotics that are uniform with respect to the spectral parameter , including near exceptional values where turning points collide , and ( ii ) that for some initial data it is required to approximate some exponentially small quantities that  like the semiclassical above - barrier reflection coefficient for the schrdinger operator  can not be suitably estimated without assumptions of analyticity and the use of turning point analysis in the complex @xmath0-plane . for a flavor of the type of calculations required to analyze the wki direct scattering problem for the mnls equation in the semiclassical limit , see @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed however , that with very few exceptions in the literature the asymptotic information that is available from the direct problem is frequently of insufficient quality and/or accuracy to continue with the inverse scattering problem without unjustified formal approximations .",
    "this is especially true when ( as for the wki problem or the zakharov - shabat problem for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation ) the direct spectral problem can not be cast as an eigenvalue problem for a self - adjoint operator .    on the other hand ,",
    "the completely rigorous asymptotic analysis of matrix riemann - hilbert problems is now a rather well - developed science . in order to bypass the difficulties mentioned above in regard to the direct problem and hence enable rigorous analysis of the cauchy problem for the mnls equation",
    ", we will choose the initial condition functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be of the specific form @xmath47 for real parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding initial values for the madelung fields are @xmath52 in fact , without loss of generality , we will assume that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as this can be accomplished by making the substitutions @xmath55 ( @xmath0 is not scaled ) in both and and dropping the tildes .",
    "unlike the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation , the mnls equation is not invariant under galilean boosts @xcite so the parameter @xmath50 can not be removed even by going to a moving frame of reference .",
    "therefore , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are essential parameters in the family of initial data of the form .",
    "the advantage of working with the family is that this choice renders the direct scattering problem for the mnls equation equivalent for all @xmath56 to a hypergeometric equation , and this in turn allows the corresponding scattering data to be obtained without any approximation whatsoever @xcite .",
    "for the initial data with @xmath53 , the quantity @xmath42 defined by becomes ( for @xmath43 ) @xmath57 to be in the transsonic case , we need @xmath58 to change sign . as a quadratic function of @xmath59 it is clear that there are at most two roots . for simplicity",
    "we want to arrange that there is exactly one simple root of this quadratic in the interval @xmath60 , and this will occur if and only if it takes opposite signs for @xmath61 ; hence we assume the condition @xmath62 for technical reasons that we will explain in  [ sec : analytic - properties ] we also assume the following two conditions : @xmath63 and @xmath64 if we introduce the combined parameters @xmath65 then conditions  imply that @xmath66 should occupy the shaded region in the diagram pictured in figure  [ fig : abplane ] .        as an example ,",
    "some specific parameter values that satisfy these conditions are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , corresponding to @xmath69 and @xmath70 . under the inequalities  , the unique simple root in the interval @xmath71 of the quadratic is exactly @xmath72 ( the other root exceeds @xmath73 for @xmath66 in the admissible region ) , and it follows that when @xmath43 , @xmath41 ( elliptic case ) for @xmath74 and @xmath40 ( hyperbolic case ) for @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "our main result is then the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath77 denote the solution of the cauchy initial - value problem for the mnls equation subject to initial data of the form with @xmath8 and @xmath9 given by , where ( without loss of generality ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and where @xmath12 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are subject to the inequalities . then there exists a smooth curve @xmath78 , @xmath37 , with @xmath79 such that for all @xmath37 and all @xmath80 , @xmath81 where the error term is uniform for @xmath82 in compact subsets and where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are smooth , real - valued functions independent of @xmath1 that satisfy @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "also , @xmath41 holds strictly for all @xmath80 and @xmath37 , while @xmath87 as @xmath88 , @xmath80 . finally , whenever @xmath80 and @xmath89 , the madelung - type fields @xmath90 exactly satisfy the dispersionless mnls system .    the functions @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath84 will be specified precisely as part of the proof ; see .",
    "significantly , these functions are obtained without directly analyzing the dispersionless mnls system , but rather arise from the solution of certain algebraic equations ( the expressions given in depend on the solution of and the identities and ) .",
    "our result is interesting in part because it is a _",
    "global _ description of the solution @xmath77 valid for all time @xmath37 in a semi - infinite spatial domain @xmath80 . unlike the semiclassical limit for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation ( for which the dispersionless system analogous to is elliptic for all initial data ) @xcite , the solution of the mnls equation with the initial data under consideration does not `` break '' at some caustic curve beyond which the madelung ansatz fails and a higher - genus multiphase behavior ensues .",
    "indeed , the boundary curve @xmath78 is merely a _ sonic line _ across which the asymptotic solution changes from subsonic type ( for @xmath80 ) to supersonic type ( for @xmath91 ) .",
    "while we do not give the proof in this paper , the sonic transition turns out not to be catastrophic for the madelung fields , which extend smoothly into the supersonic region ( although in this region the madelung theory turns out to no longer be globally valid in time , that is , the mnls solution `` breaks '' in the hyperbolic region for the dispersionless mnls system ) .",
    "the analysis corresponding to the supersonic region @xmath91 is the subject of our forthcoming paper @xcite in this series .    from the point of view of technique",
    ", this paper contains several novelties that we wish to point out .",
    "the basic approach is to formulate the riemann - hilbert problem of inverse - scattering for the mnls cauchy problem with available explicit formulae for the scattering data ( the reflection coefficient is the key quantity ) .",
    "being as the formula for the reflection coefficient involves the euler gamma function with arguments proportional to the large parameter @xmath92 , one can hardly resist applying stirling - type approximations . while much of the analysis corresponds to working with these approximations ,",
    "we are very careful about not discarding any error terms until they can be rigorously controlled ( which always occurs at the very end of the process in the steepest descent method ) . in particular , note that the function @xmath77 in theorem  [ thm : main ] _ is the exact solution of the cauchy initial - value problem for the specified initial data _ ; we do not replace the initial condition with a nearby function corresponding to approximate scattering data as is a common approach in the subject ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "there are points where the stirling approximation fails ( these correspond to the exceptional values of the spectral parameter where turning points collide in wkb theory ) , and we deal with these points with the help of a new kind of `` lens - opening '' deformation of the riemann - hilbert problem that completely sidesteps the need for any local analysis near these points .",
    "this same technique also completely solves certain problems arising from the fact that in cases where one is lucky enough that the reflection coefficient admits an analytic continuation away from the real axis , there frequently exist `` phantom poles '' that do not correspond to eigenvalues of the spectral problem but nonetheless that obstruct the sort of contour deformations that are at the heart of the steepest descent method of deift and zhou .    in  [ sec :",
    "scattering - data ] we summarize the key facts about the scattering data for the wki spectral problem in the case that the initial conditions for the mnls equation are given in the special form , incidentally correcting a sign error in the original reference @xcite .",
    "then in  [ sec : rhp ] we recall the formulation of the inverse scattering problem for the mnls equation as a riemann - hilbert problem of analytic matrix factorization . to prepare the riemann - hilbert problem for analysis in the semiclassical limit we need to introduce an appropriate `` @xmath44-function '' @xmath93 and a closely related function @xmath94 ; these functions are constructed and completely characterized in  [ sec : gfunction ] .",
    "we should point out that it is the count of the zeros of the auxiliary function @xmath95 related to derivatives of @xmath44 and @xmath96 ( see proposition  [ prop : yzeroscx ] in  [ sec : gfunction ] ) that ultimately gives rise to the global - in - time nature of our main result . finally , in  [ sec : rhp - deform ] we use the @xmath44-function along with the new `` lens - opening '' method to reduce the riemann - hilbert problem formulated in ",
    "[ sec : rhp ] to a form where it can be treated by means of neumann series for an associated system of singular integral equations of small - norm type .",
    "the estimates resulting from this analysis complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "regarding notation , we use @xmath97 and @xmath98 to denote the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of a complex number @xmath99 .",
    "we will typically use the symbol @xmath100 to refer to an arbitrarily small positive quantity .",
    "we write all matrices in boldface ( e.g. @xmath101 ) , with the exception of the pauli spin matrices : @xmath102 in particular , the expression @xmath103 appears frequently ; this is simply the diagonal matrix @xmath104 if @xmath105 denotes a harmonic or analytic scalar or matrix - valued function defined on the complement of an oriented arc @xmath106 in some neighborhood of the complex @xmath99-plane , then for @xmath107 we define @xmath108 ( respectively @xmath109 ) as the boundary value taken by @xmath110 as @xmath111 from the left ( respectively right ) as @xmath106 is traversed according to its orientation . throughout our paper ,",

    "then for @xmath870 we have @xmath871 where the principal branch of the @xmath872 power is meant .",
    "note that in terms of @xmath873 we may write the outer parametrix in the form @xmath874 where @xmath875 is an @xmath1-independent analytic matrix function with determinant one , defined for @xmath876 by @xmath877^{\\sigma_3},\\quad z\\in\\overline{d}.\\ ] ] that @xmath875 is analytic follows from the fact that @xmath878 extends from @xmath879 to all of @xmath842 as a single - valued non - vanishing analytic function .",
    "now for convenience write @xmath880 and define a matrix in the @xmath873-plane by the formulae : @xmath881 @xmath882 @xmath883 @xmath884 from the well - known asymptotic behavior @xcite of @xmath885 and @xmath886 , it follows that @xmath887 as @xmath888 in all directions of the complex plane .",
    "we define the inner parametrix by setting @xmath889 where @xmath890 is a near - identity diagonal matrix factor given by @xmath891 it is a calculation to confirm that the following jump conditions hold , which should be compared with  : @xmath892 @xmath893 @xmath894 and @xmath895 that is , the inner parametrix satisfies _ exactly _ the same jump conditions satisfied by @xmath790 in a neighborhood @xmath842 of @xmath401 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the inner and outer parametrices match each other quite well on the boundary of the disk @xmath842 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath897 but , since @xmath898 while @xmath845 and its inverse are uniformly bounded for @xmath899 , the latter factor is obviously @xmath900 . also ,",
    "since @xmath899 corresponds to @xmath901 , from we have that @xmath902 for @xmath903 .",
    "it follows that @xmath904      let @xmath905 denote the mismatch between the ( not explicitly known ) matrix function @xmath790 and its explicit global parametrix @xmath843 .",
    "because @xmath790 and @xmath843 satisfy exactly the same jump conditions on the contours @xmath400 , @xmath906 , and @xmath907 , @xmath908 may be extended analytically to the latter contours . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath908 has jumps across the disk boundaries @xmath896 and @xmath909 where @xmath790 has no jump .",
    "that is , @xmath908 may be regarded as an analytic matrix function of @xmath910 , where @xmath911 is the contour shown in figure  [ fig : ellipticerror ] .      by combining the jump conditions satisfied by @xmath790 with those known to be satisfied by the parametrix @xmath843",
    ", it is a simple calculation to see that on the complex arcs of @xmath911 as well as for @xmath189 , we have that @xmath912 is @xmath231 in both the @xmath913 and the @xmath914 senses . for @xmath191",
    "we have that @xmath915^{-1}\\mathbf{e}_+(z)-\\mathbb{i}$ ] is @xmath231 ( in fact , exponentially small ) in both the @xmath916 and @xmath917 senses . because both @xmath918 and",
    "also @xmath919 , we have @xmath920 .    the unusual nature of the jump condition on @xmath921 can be understood by introducing the matrix function @xmath922 defined by @xmath923 the jump contour @xmath924 for @xmath922 consists of reciprocals of the positive and negative square roots of the complex arcs of @xmath911 along with the real and imaginary @xmath925-axes .",
    "it follows directly that @xmath926 in both the @xmath927 and @xmath928 senses , where @xmath929 for @xmath930 .",
    "also we unambiguously calculate the value @xmath931 .",
    "this problem is solved by writing @xmath922 in terms of a cauchy integral @xmath932 where @xmath933 solves the singular integral equation @xmath934 here the the notation @xmath935 indicates that the integrals are to be evaluated for @xmath936 and the limit of @xmath925 approaching a point on @xmath924 is to be taken from the right side according to the orientation of each arc . by standard theory @xcite , this equation has a unique solution whose norm is @xmath231 . now since @xmath937 vanishes to all orders as @xmath938 along @xmath924 , @xmath922 has a nonconvergent but asymptotic power series representation @xmath939 with coefficients given by @xmath940 now in addition to the estimates @xmath941 , @xmath942 , and @xmath943 , we have from and that @xmath944 holds for sufficiently small ( independent of @xmath1 ) @xmath945 , @xmath930 . assuming without loss of generality that @xmath946 , this implies that @xmath947 uniformly for small @xmath925 .",
    "these estimates combined with the cauchy - schwarz inequality yield that @xmath948 for all @xmath949 . note that @xmath950 is necessarily a diagonal matrix ( for consistency with the jump conditions of @xmath908 for large @xmath99 ) .    from this information ,",
    "we can now obtain the asymptotic expansion of @xmath951 as @xmath320 : taking @xmath952 we have @xmath953 , and so @xmath954 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath955 for large @xmath99 , using gives @xmath956 finally , since for large @xmath957 , we have @xmath958 , we see from that the solution of the mnls cauchy problem is @xmath959 this asymptotic formula has the form written in the statement of theorem  [ thm : main ] where @xmath960 that the derived fields @xmath961 and @xmath962 solve the dispersionless mnls system has already been shown , since according to we can express @xmath963 explicitly in terms of @xmath572 , and hence @xmath964 we have already seen ( see the discussion at the end of  [ sec : q ] ) that these substitutions reduce the dispersionless mnls system to diagonal ( riemann invariant ) form , reproducing exactly the partial differential equations that were proved in proposition  [ prop : cxwhitham ] to be satisfied by @xmath572 and @xmath965 .",
    "next , we show that @xmath85 and that @xmath86 . to see this",
    ", we note that according to proposition  [ prop : momentscxtzero ] , we have @xmath589 for @xmath74 , where @xmath386 is the solution in the upper half - plane of the turning point equation ; this implies that the quadratic @xmath265 is a constant multiple of the factored form @xmath966 , which in turn implies the identities : @xmath967\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{1}{16}\\left(\\alpha u_0(x)-1\\right)^2=|q(x,0)|^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : two - identities}\\ ] ] under the condition that @xmath968 , it is easy to see that and imply that @xmath969 but because @xmath970 , the condition @xmath968 follows from the inequality @xmath41 that holds for @xmath74 at @xmath43 .",
    "it is obvious from that @xmath971 for all @xmath80 and @xmath37 , and hence we can take a positive square root to find that @xmath972 .",
    "since we already have @xmath30 , to prove that @xmath86 we simply need to establish the latter identity at some point @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , we examine the limit @xmath389 ; since according to we have @xmath973 , we simply compare with the explicit expression for the limiting value of @xmath974 as @xmath389 as given by ; thus the problem is reduced to checking the equality of two explicit functions of the three real parameters @xmath2 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 over the region constrained by the three inequalities . we have confirmed this equality numerically , and we therefore conclude that indeed @xmath975 holds for all @xmath74 .    99 digital library of mathematical functions . _",
