    "the growth of cross sections with gluon splitting according to the dglap [ 1 ] and bfkl [ 2 ] evolution equations would violate the unitarity .",
    "therefore , the corrections of the higher order qcd , which shadow the growth of parton densities and lead to an eventual saturation of parton densities , become a focus of intensive study in recent years . in this respect , the glr - mq ( by gribov , levin ryskin in [ 3 ] and mueller and qiu in [ 4 ] ) and bk ( by balitsky and kovchegov in [ 5 ] ) equations are broadly regarded as two solvable models to compute the shadowing corrections to the dglap and bfkl equations , respectively .",
    "one of the key problems in restoring unitarity is the origin of the negative corrections . in the viewpoint of elementary qcd interaction ,",
    "the suppression of the gluon splitting comes from its inverse process - the gluon recombination .",
    "the negative screening effects in the recombination processes originally occur in the interferant cut - diagrams of the recombination amplitudes [ 3,6 ] . for computing the contributions from the interference processes ,",
    "the agk cutting rules [ 7 ] were used in the derivation of the glr - mq equation .    on the other hand",
    ", one of us ( zhu ) disputed the above mentioned applications of the agk cutting rules in the glr - mq equation , and used the topt - cutting rules based on the time ordered perturbation theory ( topt ) instead of the agk cutting rules to expose the relations among various cut diagrams in a recombination process [ 6 ] .",
    "thus , we can completely compute the contributions of the gluon recombination processes .",
    "consequently , a modified dglap equation was proposed [ 6,8 ] .",
    "a remarkable property of this equation is that the positive antishadowing and negative shadowing components in the nonlinear evolution equation are naturally separated . as a result ,",
    "the corrections from gluon recombination at small @xmath1 depend not only on the size of gluon density at this value of @xmath1 , but also on the shape of gluon density in the region @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "thus , the shadowing effects in the evolution process will be weakened by the antishadowing effects if the gluon distribution has a steeper form .",
    "the antishadowing effects always coexist with the shadowing effects in the qcd recombination processes as a general conclusion of the momentum conservation [ 9 ] .",
    "therefore , similar antishadowing effects should exist in any unitarized bfkl equation . in this work",
    "we try to find the antishadowing effects in the unitarized bfkl equation .",
    "the total momentum carried by gluons is not changed as a result of the gluon fusion but simply redistributed to different @xmath1 regions .",
    "the depleted momentum due to the fusion is heaped up step by step toward a larger @xmath1 direction , which leads to an enhanced density of higher momentum gluons ( i.e. the antishadowing effects ) .",
    "we shall show that the antishadowing effects have a sizeable influence on the gluon distribution function in the preasymptotic regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive a unitarized bfkl equation with the gluon recombination , which contains the contributions of the shadowing and antishadowing effects .",
    "the numerical analysis of our equation are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we show that our equation reduces to the bk equation near the saturation limit .",
    "we also compare our equation with a modified bk equation in this section .",
    "we develop a unified framework to construct the evolution equations for both the integrated and unintegrated gluon distribution functions .",
    "we begin from a deep inelastic scattering process , where the unintegrated gluon distribution is measured . in the @xmath3-factorization scheme ,",
    "the cross section is decomposed into    @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 which contains the perturbative evolution kernel @xmath7 , the nonperturbative unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath8 and the @xmath9-parton cross section @xmath10 . for simplicity",
    ", we take the fixed qcd coupling in this work . according to the scale - invariant parton picture of the renormalization group [ 10 ] ,",
    "we regard @xmath11 as the increment of the distribution @xmath12 when it evolves from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the connection between the two functions @xmath12 and @xmath15 via eq.(1 ) is    @xmath16 @xmath17    the relation of the unintegrated gluon distribution with the integrated gluon distribution is    @xmath18 or    @xmath19    in the evolution along the transverse momentum ( or along the longitudinal momentum ) , we differentiate eq.(2 ) with respect to @xmath20 ( or to @xmath1 ) and get    @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 or    @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 respectively .",
    "generally , the resummation solution is hard to obtain from these two equations .",
    "however , at the @xmath27 ( or at the @xmath28 ) the evolution kernel @xmath29 in eq.(5 ) ( or in eq.(6 ) ) is only the function of the longitudinal variable ( or of the transverse variables ) and the second term on the right - hand side of eq.(5 ) ( or of eq.(6 ) ) vanishes . in this case",
    ", the resummation becomes possible .",
    "for example , using eq.(3 ) we write    @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 and    @xmath33 on the other hand , at @xmath34 we have    @xmath35 thus , from eqs.(5 ) and ( 7 ) one can get the dglap equation at small @xmath1 for the gluon distribution    @xmath36 @xmath37    now let us consider the corrections of the gluon recombination to the dglap equation . the one step evolution containing the gluon recombination",
    "is illustrated in fig.1(a ) , where the initial gluons from the two legs are resummed using the dglap equation .",
    "four different kinds of the evolution kernels for @xmath38 are listed in fig.2 .",
    "similar to eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) we derive the modified dglap equation from    @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where a power suppression factor @xmath42 has been extracted from the evolution kernel .",
    "the positive and negative terms are from the contributions of the diagrams fig.2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the topt calculations [ 8 ] give    @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45    the gluon correlation function @xmath46 is a generalization of the gluon distribution beyond the leading twist .",
    "it is usually modelled as the product of two gluon distributions [ 6 ] .",
    "for example ,    @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a correlation coefficient with the dimension @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 is the effective correlation length of two recombination gluons and we take @xmath51 ( the   radius   of   a  nucleon ) . setting eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) to eq.(11 ) , we obtain the modified dglap equation combining dglap dynamics at small @xmath1    @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56    it is interesting to compare this small-@xmath1 version of the modified dglap equation with the glr - mq equation , which is [ 4 ]    @xmath52 @xmath57 where    @xmath58 is assumed .",
    "although both of the two equations have been hoped to describe the corrections of the gluon recombination to the linear dglap equation at the @xmath59 , they have different forms due to the following reasons :    \\(1 ) the glr - mq equation is derived basing on the following two works .",
    "one is the idea that the negative shadowing effects arise from the interference processes of the gluon recombination .",
    "gribov , levin and ryskin used the agk cutting rules to show that the contributions from the real cut diagrams ( see fig.2(a ) ) and the interferant cut diagrams ( see fig.2(b ) ) only differ in the numerical weights , which is 2 and -4 , respectively .",
    "thus , the net effects of the gluon recombination can be simply calculated by multiplying the real diagrams by a negative weight .",
    "obviously , the antishadowing effects in this approach are completely cancelled by the shadowing effects and the resulting evolution equation violates the momentum conservation .",
    "another work is the calculation of the recombination functions at the @xmath59 in a covariant perturbation theory by mueller and qiu [ 4 ] , where a special treatment was used to remove the infrared ( ir ) singularities in the gluonic twist-4 coefficient functions .",
    "the gluon recombination functions in the glr - mq equation are separated out from the above mentioned ir - safe coefficient functions .",
    "\\(2 ) in the derivation of the modified dglap equation , the topt was first used to establish the relations among all the relevant cut diagrams in fig.2 [ 6 ] .",
    "we showed that the shadowing and antishadowing effects share the same recombination function but occupy different kinematic regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the contributions of the two virtual diagrams fig.2(c ) and ( d ) cancel against each other .",
    "thus , the net effects depend not only on the local value of the gluon distribution at the observed point , but also on the shape of the gluon distribution when the bjorken variable goes from @xmath1 to @xmath60 . in consequence ,",
    "the shadowing effects in the evolution process will be obviously weakened by the antishadowing effects if the distribution is steeper [ 11 ] .",
    "we found that the same topt framework allows us to calculate the recombination functions including quarks and gluons in the whole region of @xmath1 at the @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , the momentum conservation is restored in the modified dglap equation [ 6 ] .",
    "we also showed in [ 8 ] that the gluon recombination functions can be reasonably separated from the twist-4 coefficient functions in the topt approach without the above mentioned special treatment , though the results of the two methods only differ by a constant at the @xmath59 .    in next step , we consider the recombination of two unintegrated gluon distribution functions , which obey the bfkl equation .",
    "the cut diagram corresponding to fig.1(a ) is fig.1(b ) , where the dashed box implies a new recombination kernel of two bfkl solutions .",
    "the initial gluons couple with the gluonic dipole and it means that two initial legs evolve according to the bfkl dynamics .",
    "one can expect that @xmath62 is more complicated than @xmath63 . as an approximate model , we use kernel @xmath63 to replace the kernel @xmath64 in fig.1(b ) . in the concrete ,",
    "the contributions of two correlated unintegrated distribution functions @xmath65 to the measured ( integrated ) distribution @xmath66 via the recombination processes are    @xmath67 @xmath68 thus , we have    @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 using eqs.(6 ) and ( 12 ) we obtain the corrections to the evolution of the unintegrated gluon distribution along small @xmath1 direction    @xmath72 combining with the bfkl equation , we obtain a unitarized bfkl equation    @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where similar to eq . ( 13 ) we define    @xmath76 eq.(20 ) is our unitarized bfkl equation for the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "since the gluon distribution becomes flatter near the saturation limit , in this range we can take the approximation    @xmath77 in eq.(20 ) , and get    @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath78",
    "we make some numerical calculations to illustrate the antishadowing effects . for simplicity , we fix the coupling constant to be @xmath79 .",
    "eq.(20 ) is the corrections of the gluon recombination to the bfkl evolution equation .",
    "therefore , we use a parameter form of the bfkl solution as the input distribution at @xmath80 [ 12 ]    @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 is of nonperturbative origin and the normalization constant @xmath85 . on the other hand , we take @xmath86 in eq.(20 ) .",
    "we assume that eq.(20 ) begins to work from the bfkl - region . in this case",
    ", the distribution @xmath87 has a steeper @xmath1-dependence at the starting point @xmath88 of the evolution where the shadowing and antishadowing effects almost cancel out .",
    "thus , we compute the value of @xmath89 at the i - th step of the evolution from @xmath90 using the bfkl equation , i.e. ,    @xmath91 the numerical results show a faster divergence of the distribution @xmath92 due to the antishadowing effects that cancel out or even outweigh the shadowing effects in the typical bfkl - solution .",
    "of course , we can not expect such infinite growth of the gluons at small @xmath1 .",
    "this unphysical result appears because the bfkl dynamics are not constrained by the energy - momentum conservation , which must be added from the outside of the evolution equation .",
    "according to the experiences in the solutions of the modified dglap equation , the net antishadowing effects in a small @xmath1 region always accompany the stronger net shadowing effects in the smaller @xmath1 region [ 11 ] .",
    "one can expect that the evolution asymptotically approaches the bk dynamics under the action of the net shadowing effects .",
    "therefore , we modify the program ( 25 ) to    @xmath93 where @xmath94 indicates that the evolution from @xmath95 to @xmath96 is controlled by eq.(23 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 implies the different velocities approaching the bk dynamics .",
    "there is a limit value of @xmath98 and the solution of eq.(20 ) becomes divergent when @xmath99 . as an example , we take @xmath100 and divide the evolution into the @xmath101-steps on @xmath102 .    in fig.3(a ) we plot the unintegrated gluon distribution function ( solid curves ) as a function of @xmath1 for two different values of @xmath20 and where @xmath103 .",
    "the possible solutions of eq.(20 ) should lie between the solid and point curves since @xmath104 . for comparison ,",
    "the results of two calculations based on the bfkl equation ( dashed curves ) and eq.(23 ) without the antishadowing effects ( point curves ) are listed .",
    "one can find that eq.(20 ) keeps the bfkl - behavior in a larger evolution region than eq.(23 ) due to the antishadowing effects .",
    "the @xmath20-dependence of the unintegrated gluon distribution function with @xmath103 is given in fig.3(b ) .",
    "the saturation of distribution is usually defined as a limit form , which is insensitive to @xmath1 or @xmath20 .",
    "we have not observed such saturation phenomenon in a broad kinematical range , although the obvious suppressions of the net shadowing effects can be found in fig.3 .",
    "the reason is that the factor @xmath105 in both the eqs.(20 ) and ( 23 ) suppresses the contributions of the nonlinear terms at larger values of @xmath20 .",
    "we give the integrated gluon density using eq.(3 ) in fig.4 . we still have not observed the saturation limit on the @xmath106-dependence of the distribution @xmath107 in fig.4(b ) .",
    "it is interesting that this conclusion is qualitatively consistent with our previous work [ 11 ] , where the corrections of the same gluon recombination kernel to the dglap evolution equation are considered . of course , to obtain more practical predictions about the gluon distribution at small @xmath1 , further corrections should be considered , for example , the corrections from the running @xmath108 , the bfkl dynamics in the ir - region @xmath109 , and in particular , the choice of the input distribution .",
    "however , the important distinction between the antishadowing effects and shadowing effects as demonstrated in fig.4 should remain after those corrections are incorporated .",
    "we try to compare the nonlinear evolution equation ( 20 ) with the bk equation , which is originally written in the transverse coordinate space for the scattering amplitude .",
    "there are different definitions of the scattering amplitude in the qcd evolution equation . in this work",
    ", we note that the bfkl equation for the scattering amplitude @xmath110 has the following form [ 13 ] ,                          @xmath128 where @xmath129 indicates that the evolution from @xmath95 to @xmath96 is according to eq.(33 ) .",
    "the minimum parameter @xmath130 , which is larger than @xmath131 since the nonlinear effects in eq.(32 ) are stronger than that in eq.(20 ) .",
    "fig.5 shows the solutions ( solid curves ) of eq.(32 ) with @xmath132 . for comparison , we give the solutions of the bk equation ( point curves ) and the linear part of eq.(32 ) ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the possible solutions of eq.(32 ) should lie between the solid and point curves since @xmath133 .",
    "fig.6 is such a possible solution with @xmath134 .",
    "one can find that the antishadowing effects lead to quite different behaviors between the amplitude @xmath135 and the distribution @xmath92 .",
    "the antishadowing effects on the scattering amplitude sharpen the transition form of the amplitude @xmath135 and even violate the unitarity due to @xmath136 if we take the definition eq.(28 ) .",
    "the reasons for the stronger antishadowing effects are that ( 1 ) we use a normalized definition about the amplitude in eq.(28 ) so that the coefficients of the nonlinear terms are the same magnitude as that of the linear terms in eq.(32 ) ; ( 2 ) the suppression factor @xmath105 is absorbed by the scattering amplitude due to eq.(28 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the momentum compensation for the shadowing effects was also discussed using a modified nonlinear evolution equation in ref.[16 ] . in the impact",
    "parameter - independent case this equation reads      @xmath121 @xmath140 @xmath141\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath142 @xmath143\\right\\}. \\eqno(37)\\ ] ] although eqs.(36 ) and ( 37 ) have similar nonlinear antishadowing terms ( only differ by a factor @xmath144 ) , one can find that the main difference between these two equations is that the same momentum compensation mechanism acts on both linear and nonlinear terms in eq.(36 ) , while the corresponding corrections in eq.(37 ) are from the virtual and recombination processes , respectively .",
    "although we have discussed the contributions of the antishadowing effects to the unitarized bfkl equation , we note , however , that the following problems remain to be solved : ( i ) as we have emphasized , the replacement of the recombination functions for two bfkl - solutions with @xmath63 in this work is an approximate method .",
    "the unitarized bfkl equation near the saturation range should take a new form ; ( ii ) how to determine the parameter @xmath97 in eq.(26 ) ?",
    "perhaps , the most reliable test of the antishadowing effects would be a comparison to the nuclear antishadowing effects , which has been observed in the emc effect [ 17 ] .",
    "however , the kinematic region of the nuclear antishadowing effects is about @xmath145 , where we should combine the dglap dynamics in eq.(20 ) and it is beyond the scope of the present paper ; ( iii ) the qcd evolution should be performed with running @xmath108 in the numerical procedure .",
    "these problems will be our following subjects .    in conclusion , we presented the corrections of the gluon recombination to the bfkl equation and they lead to a new unitarized nonlinear evolution equation , which incorporates both shadowing and antishadowing effects .",
    "the new equation reduces to the bk equation near the saturation limit .",
    "the numerical solutions of the equation show that the antishadowing effects have a sizeable influence on the gluon distribution function in the preasymptotic regime .",
