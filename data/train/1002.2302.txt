    "the existence of a remnant mass of a black hole is verified by different approaches - using a generalised uncertainty principle @xcite or analysing the tunnelling probability @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the modifications to the laws of schwarzschild black hole thermodynamics by starting from a new gup which is derived from certain basic assumptions .",
    "the consequences of these modifications are investigated in details .",
    "we show the existence of a critical ( ans also singular ) mass for the black hole below ( at ) which the thermodynamic entities become complex ( ill defined ) .",
    "however both the critical and singular mass are less than another mass - the remnant mass .",
    "our analysis reveals that the black hole evaporation does not lead to a singularity .",
    "this process terminates at a finite mass which we call the remnant mass .",
    "since , as already stated , both the critical and singular masses are less than the remnant mass , the problematic situations are avoided .",
    "+ section 2 gives the derivation of the gup .",
    "corrections induced by this gup to the black hole thermodynamics are given in section 3 .",
