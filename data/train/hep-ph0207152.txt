    "the total cross section for virtual photon - proton scattering in the region of small @xmath0 and intermediate @xmath1 can be well described by the saturation model ( sm ) @xcite . the very good agreement with experimental data",
    "can be extended even to the region of rather small @xmath1 by adjusting an effective quark mass . at present",
    "there is no deep understanding of the fit value of the parameter as we do not understand in detail the confinement and the underlying nonperturbative effects related to large size qcd contributions .    in this presentation",
    "i shall limit to the production of heavy quarks which is simpler and more transparent for real photons . here",
    "one can partially avoid the problem of the poor understanding of the effective light quark mass , i.e. the domain of the large ( transverse ) size of the hadronic system emerging from the photon .",
    "it was shown recently that the simple sm description can be succesfully extended also to the photon - photon scattering @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark production in photon - photon collisions is interesting in the context of a deficit of standard qcd predictions relative to the experimental data as observed recently for @xmath2 quark production .",
    "in the picture of dipole scattering the cross section for heavy quark - antiquark ( @xmath3 ) photoproduction on the nucleon can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is ( transverse ) quark - antiquark photon wave function ( see for instance @xcite ) and @xmath6 is the dipole - nucleon total cross section .",
    "inspired by its phenomenological success @xcite we shall use the sm parametrization for @xmath6 . because for real photoproduction the bjorken-@xmath0 is not defined",
    "we are forced to replace @xmath0 by @xmath7 @xcite .    in fig.1a",
    "we show predictions of sm for charm photoproduction .",
    "the dotted line represents calculations based on eq.([sm_gamma_nuc ] ) .",
    "the result of this calculation exceeds considerably the fixed target experimental data .",
    "one should remember , however , that the simple formula ( [ sm_gamma_nuc ] ) applies at high energies only . at lower energies one should include effects due to kinematical threshold . in the momentum representation",
    "this can be done by requiring : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the invariant mass of the final @xmath3 system .",
    "this upper limit still exceeds the low energy experimental data .",
    "there are phase space limitations in the region @xmath10 1 which have been neglected so far .",
    "those can be estimated using naive counting rules .",
    "such a procedure leads to a reasonable agreement with the fixed target experimental data .",
    "the deviation of the solid line from the dotted line gives an idea of the range of the safe applicability of sm for the production of the charm quarks / antiquarks .",
    "the cross section for @xmath11 20 gev is practically independent of the approximate treatment of the threshold effects .",
    "sm seems to slightly underestimate the h1 collaboration data @xcite . for comparison in fig.1",
    "we show the result of similar calculations in the collinear approach ( thick dash - dotted line ) with details described in @xcite .",
    "the calculation above is not complete .",
    "for real photons a vector dominance contribution due to photon fluctuation into vector mesons should be included on the top of the dipole contribution . in the present calculation",
    "we include only the dominant gluon - gluon fusion component .",
    "then @xmath12 here the @xmath13 constants describe the transition of the photon into vector mesons ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the gluon distributions in vector mesons are taken as that for the pion @xcite .",
    "the dash - dotted line in fig.1a shows the vdm contribution calculated in the leading order ( lo ) approximation for @xmath17 .",
    "the so - calculated vdm contribution can not be neglected at high energies .",
    "the situation for bottom photoproduction seems similar . in fig.1b",
    "we compare the sm predictions with the data from the h1 collaboration @xcite . here",
    "the threshold effects may survive up to very high energy @xmath18 50 gev . again",
    "the predictions of sm are slightly below the h1 experimental data point .",
    "the relative magnitude of the vdm component is similar as for the charm production .    .",
    "the dotted line : standard sm , the dashed line : includes kinematical threshold , the solid line includes in addition a suppression by @xmath19 , the thick dash - dotted line : collinear approximation and the thin dash - dotted line : the lo vdm contribution .",

    "in the dipole - dipole approach @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dipole - dipole cross section .",
    "there are two problems associated with direct use of ( [ sm_qqbar ] ) .",
    "first of all , it is not completely clear how to generalize @xmath21 from @xmath6 parametrized in @xcite .",
    "secondly , formula ( [ sm_qqbar ] ) is correct only at @xmath22 . at lower energies one should worry about proximity of the kinematical threshold .    in a very recent paper @xcite",
    "a new phenomenological parametrization for @xmath21 has been proposed .",
    "the phenomenological threshold factor in @xcite does not guarantee automatic vanishing of the cross section exactly below the true kinematical threshold @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , instead of the phenomenological factor we rather impose an extra kinematical constraint : @xmath24 on the integration in ( [ sm_qqbar ] ) .",
    "it is not completely clear how to generalize the energy dependence of @xmath25 in photon - nucleon scattering to the energy dependence of @xmath21 in photon - photon scattering .",
    "in @xcite i have defined the parameter which controls the sm energy dependence of @xmath21 in a symmetric way with respect to both photons . in comparison to the prescription in @xcite ,",
    "our prescription leads to a small reduction of the cross section far from the threshold @xcite .    up to now",
    "we have calculated the contribution when photons fluctuate into quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the dipole approach must be supplemented to include the contribution when either of the photons fluctuates into vector mesons .",
    "if the first photon fluctuates into the vector mesons , the so - defined single - resolved contribution to the heavy quark - antiquark production can be calculated analogously to the photon - nucleon case as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is vector meson - dipole total cross section . in the spirit of sm , we parametrize the latter exactly as for the photon - nucleon case @xcite with a simple rescaling of the normalization factor @xmath28 . in the present calculation",
    "@xmath29 as well as the other parameters of sm are taken from @xcite .",
    "analogously , if the second photon fluctuates into vector mesons we obtain @xmath30 this clearly doubles the first contribution ( [ sr_1 ] ) to the total cross section .",
    "the integrations in ( [ sr_1 ] ) and ( [ sr_2 ] ) are not free of kinematical constraints .",
    "when calculating both single - resolved contributions , it should be checked additionally if the heavy quark - antiquark invariant mass @xmath9 is smaller than the total photon - photon energy @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fig.2 we show different contributions to the inclusive @xmath32 ( left panel ) and @xmath33 ( right panel ) production in photon - photon scattering .",
    "the thick solid line represents the sum of all contributions .",
    "let us start from the discussion of the inclusive charm production .",
    "the experimental data of the l3 collaboration @xcite are shown for comparison .",
    "the modifications discussed above lead to a small damping of the cross section in comparison to @xcite .",
    "the corresponding result ( long - dashed line ) stays below the recent experimental data of the l3 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the hadronic single - resolved contribution constitutes about 30 - 40 % of the main sm contribution . at high energies the cross section for the @xmath34 component is about 8 % of that for the single @xmath35 pair component . in the inclusive cross section its contribution should be doubled because each of the heavy quarks / antiquarks can be potentially identified experimentally .",

    "the experimental data for inclusive @xmath36 production are from ref.@xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=222 ]    at higher energies the direct contribution is practically negligible .",
    "in contrast , the hadronic double - resolved contribution , when each of the two photons fluctuates into a vector meson @xcite is shown by the thin solid line in the figure becomes important only at very high energies relevant for tesla .",
    "here we have consistently taken @xmath37 .",
    "the situation for bottom production ( see right panel ) is somewhat different . here",
    "the main sm component is dominant . due to smaller charge of the bottom quark than that for the charm quark",
    ", the direct component is effectively reduced with respect to the dominant sm component by the corresponding ratio of quark / antiquark charges : @xmath38 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath39 component .",
    "here , in addition , there are threshold effects which play a role up to relatively high energy .",
    "there is no common consensus in the literature on detailed understanding of the dynamics of photon - nucleon and photon - photon collisions . in this presentation",
    "i have limited the discussion to the production of heavy quarks simultaneously in photon - nucleon and photon - photon collisions at high energies .",
    "the sizeable mass of charm or bottom quarks sets a natural low energy limit on a naive application of sm . here a careful treatment of the kinematical threshold is required .",
    "we have started the analysis from ( real ) photon - nucleon scattering , which is very close to the domain of sm as formulated in @xcite . if the kinematical threshold corrections are included , sm gives similar results as the standard collinear approach for both charm and bottom production .",
    "we have estimated the vdm contribution to the heavy quark production .",
    "the second part of the present analysis has been devoted to real photon - real photon collisions .",
    "for the first time in the literature we have estimated the cross section for the production of @xmath40 final state .",
    "we have found that this component constitutes up to 10 - 15 % of the inclusive charm production at high energies and is negligible for the bottom production .",
    "we have shown how to generalize sm to the case when one of the photons fluctuates into light vector mesons .",
    "it was found that this component yields a significant correction of about 30 - 40 % for inclusive charm production and 15 - 20 % for bottom production .",
    "we have shown that the double resolved component , when both photons fluctuate into light vector mesons , is nonnegligible only at very high energies , both for the charm and bottom production ."
