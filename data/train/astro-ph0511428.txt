    "the idea that the quasar infrared ( ir ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) could be dominated by thermal emission from dust was already proposed by @xcite , who noted an excess at @xmath5 m with respect to the power ",
    "law emission that was known to dominate the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical spectrum .",
    "@xcite was the first to demonstrate that it was possible to describe this emission by means of thermal radiation from dust heated by the primary optical / uv continuum known to dominate type-1 agn sed .",
    "he considered an optically thick , either smooth or a clumpy dust distribution within a non - spherical geometry .",
    "such a model could naturally account for the observed @xmath6 m bump , which was attributed to graphite grains with temperatures close to their sublimation limit .",
    "the broadness of the ir sed , that could not be reproduced by means of a single - temperature black body , was explained in terms of multiple temperature components of dust .",
    "more quantitative models have been developed since then , accounting for different features and using different computational approaches for solving the radiative transfer equation .",
    "@xcite suggested an emission model from an annular ring of dust . assuming a common extinction curve for all of the grains , a distribution function of grain composition and sizes as given in @xcite and",
    "not accounting for light scattering , they solved the radiative transfer problem with the bhm - vitense method described in @xcite .",
    "based on this model , they explored the main properties of ir emission in agn , such as the width of the sed and the wavelength of peak emission , ir colours and the presence and/or absence of the @xmath7 m silicate feature .",
    "@xcite solved the radiative transfer equation by means of the _ @xmath8iteration _ method ( see [ sec : lambda - iter ] for more details ) , adopting the @xcite model for interstellar dust , based on both graphite and silicate grains , and taking into account radiation scattering .",
    "their adopted geometry was the so  called _ flared disc _ , with dust grain density that was allowed to vary both along the radial and the vertical coordinates .",
    "@xcite studied a configuration given by an optically thick silicate disc , finding no need for silicate grains depletion or non - standard dust composition in order to weaken the strength of the @xmath7 m feature , which turned out to be weak in most of his models with optical depth larger than @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore he found that , in contrast with @xcite , scattering is not negligible and does affect the shape of the near ir emission in those models where optical depth is high .",
    "@xcite analysed three different geometrical configurations for the torus , a flared and a tapered disc and an anisotropic sphere , and found that a tapered disc ( i.e. a disc whose height increases along with distance from the center but flattens at a constant height in the outer parts ) with an opening angle of @xmath10 was the most succesful representation of what was observed .",
    "they followed a ray  tracing numerical method , with the same dust mixture as in @xcite .",
    "the sublimation temperature was assumed to be @xmath11 k for all grains , while the distances from the central source where this temperature is reached were assumed to be dependent on the grain size . in the same line",
    ", @xcite modelled the dusty torus as a flared disc in which both graphite and silicate where taken to sublimate at a temperature of @xmath12 k. in their analysis they concluded that flared tori , dust composed of silicate and graphite grains and a power - law density distribution failed to explain the observed featureless agn spectra .    in parallel",
    ", @xcite developed a torus model in which dust was distributed in clumps .",
    "they solved the radiative transfer for each clump by means of the radiative code dusty @xcite and then computed the final emission as the sum of clumps emission calculated using a ray  tracing approach .    at variance with @xcite , @xcite claim that the obscuring torus could not be flat ( tapered , for example ) , and should rather be conical or flaring .",
    "their more reliable models predicted constant density over the whole torus and a quite large value for the inner radius ( @xmath13 pc ) , which they found necessary in order to fit observed colours .",
    "they also tried to modify the power - law distribution function for grain sizes with respect to that given by @xcite , in order to attenuate the strength of the @xmath1 m silicate feature and recently concluded that there was no need for a clumpy dust distribution @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we try to combine most of the successful features of the previous works to built an improved model explaining ir emission in agn .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ model ] presents the physical and computational details of the model .",
    "section [ param ] discusses the contribution of each of the model parameters in the produced seds . in section [ fit ]",
    "we explain the observed seds of a series of objects taken from the literature using various realisations of the torus model in combination with starburst templates . finally in section",
    "[ discuss ] we discuss our results and conclusions .",
    "we use a simple but realistic geometry for the spatial distribution of dust : the _ flared disc _ ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , that can be represented as two concentric spheres , delimiting respectively the inner and the outer torus radius , having the polar cones removed .",
    "is the ratio of the external to internal radius and @xmath14 is the full  opening angle of the torus.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    the size of the torus is defined by the outer radius @xmath15  the inner radius being defined by the sublimation temperature of dust grains under the influence of the strong nuclear radiation field  and by the angular opening angle @xmath14 of the torus itself ( see fig . [",
    "fig : torus ] ) . considering a typical graphite grain with radius @xmath16 m and using the thermal equilibrium equation ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : thrm ] ) , @xcite derives the following formula to compute the distance at which this grain reaches the sublimation temperature : @xmath17 , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the bolometric ultraviolet / optical luminosity emitted by the central source , expressed in units of @xmath19 erg s@xmath20 and @xmath21 is the sublimation temperature of the dust grain given in units of @xmath12 k. note that this relations depends on both the grain dimension and species but we here assume as a common minimum radius the average one .",
    "we account for the different sublimation temperature of silicate grains , however , yielding a minimum radius that can be up to three times larger than the one for graphite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the dust layer composed by graphite grains , that attenuates the x - ray and uv emission , is taken into account when computing the silicate minimum radius .      we define a geometrical grid with reference to a polar coordinates system @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sys_ref ] , by dividing the torus in _",
    "volume elements_. we then compute all the quantities of interest within a given volume element as if all dust properties were those of the center . since the temperature gradient is higher in the inner parts , we used a logarithmic  spaced division for the radial coordinate , in order to better sample the properties of the emission in the innermost regions .",
    "the grid has a constant number of subdivisions in the azimuthal coordinate ( @xmath23 ) that is fixed to @xmath24 , while the equatorial distance coordinate is divided in @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 parts for models with respectively @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 of torus amplitude .",
    "the radial coordinate is divided in @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 parts for @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the wavelentgh values at which the spectrum is computed consist in a grid equally - spaced in logarithm with @xmath33 points in the range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 m.     the geometry reproduces a type-2 objects , while @xmath39 would correspond to the type-1 view , according to the unified model.,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    neither the computation of the emitted radiation from each grain species in each volume elements within the torus , nor the computation of the optical depth between all torus cells are particularly cpu time consuming .",
    "however , for a typical @xmath40 element grid ( see sect . 3.1 below ) this computation must be repeated @xmath41 times , if we want to evaluate the contribution to the radiation field in each element from all other in the torus .",
    "it is therefore essential to exploit all the symmetries of the adopted geometry , identifying groups of volume elements whose properties are identical all over the torus grid .",
    "for instance , all volume elements at any given @xmath23 have exactly the same dust density , temperature and emission conditions .",
    "it is sufficient to compute these quantities just for these elements , which we will refer to as * sample elements*.    furthermore , when computing the incoming radiation on a given sample element , the problem is symmetric with respect to the @xmath42 plane , so it is possible to compute incoming radiation from just one side of the torus .",
    "the main dust components are silicate and graphite grains , in almost equal percentages .",
    "the former are responsible for the observed absorption feature at @xmath43 m in type-2 objects , while the latter are responsible for the rapid decline of the emission at wavelength shortwards of a few m , corresponding to a black body emission of about @xmath12 k , the sublimation temperature for these particular grains .",
    "most models in the literature make use of a small number of grain categories at different sizes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . following an approach similar to that of @xcite",
    ", we decided to adopt a more complete distribution using , for each of the two species , scattering and absorption coefficients given by @xcite for different grains sizes from @xmath44 to @xmath45 m and from @xmath46 to @xmath45 m for graphite and silicate respectively .",
    "as for the distribution function for the grains sizes @xmath47 we adopted the mrn distribution ( see @xcite ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of grains with radius between @xmath47 and @xmath50 normalized to the number of hydrogen atoms . as for the exponent @xmath51 ,",
    "the value of the standard galactic extinction curve ( @xcite , @xmath52 ) has been adopted , so that the extinction curve that characterizes our model is similar to the galactic one .",
    "the constant @xmath53 gives the normalization with respect to hydrogen abundance , and it is taken to be @xmath54 for graphite and @xmath55 for silicates @xcite .",
    "we adopted a law for the gas density within the torus allowing for a density gradient along the radial and the polar distance ( @xmath56 ) coordinates : @xmath57 the normalization constant @xmath58 here is a linear function of the equatorial optical depth ( see section [ sec : compute ] ) .",
    "the latter will be used in the following instead of the @xmath58 parameter .",
    "we assume that the torus is illuminated by a central point - like energy source with isotropic emission .",
    "we define its spectrum in the wavelength range @xmath59",
    "m @xmath60 m ( corresponding to the frequency range @xmath61 hz ) and described it as a composition of power laws with variable indices . the values that we adopted are the same as in @xcite or @xcite , namely : @xmath62 & \\mbox{if } \\ ; 0.001 < \\lambda < 0.03   & [ \\mu]\\\\ l_0\\cdot \\lambda^{0 }     & [ erg / s ] & \\mbox{if } \\ ; 0.03   < \\lambda < 0.125 & [ \\mu]\\\\ l_0\\cdot \\lambda^{-0.5 } & [ erg / s ] & \\mbox{if } \\ ; 0.125 < \\lambda < 20.0   & [ \\mu ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath63 sets the bolometric luminosity normalization constant .",
    "the radiation emitted by the above described physical configuration is given by the sum of the primary source located in the torus center and a secondary contribution given by thermal and scattering dust emission .",
    "therefore dust plays a double role , first absorbing the radiant energy emitted by the primary source , partially or totally obscuring it , then re - emitting it at longer wavelengths , typically in the spectral range @xmath64 m. a complication arises from the fact that dust can be optically thick to its own radiation .",
    "this requires the solution of the radiative transfer equation [ eq . ( [ eqn : transfer ] ) below ] .",
    "in particular the presence of a dust scattering component makes this equation not solvable analytically : the source function is not known _ a priori _ , depending on the solution @xmath65 itself .",
    "the thermal and scattered components of dust radiation are described by the absorption ( @xmath66 ) and the scattering ( @xmath67 ) coefficients respectively , so that the radiative transfer equation will be written as : @xmath68 in which @xmath69 is the _ source function _ , that can also be written as ( see @xcite ) : @xmath70 i.e. a weighted average of the two separate source functions .",
    "we solved the transfer equation numerically adopting the _ @xmath8iteration _ method : a lower limit for the incident radiation is estimated assuming that the only source of radiation ( and hence of dust  heating ) is the central , non - thermal , source .",
    "the equilibrium temperature ( and hence thermal emission ) of the grains of each species in each sample element is found by solving the thermal equilibrium equation : @xmath71 where the equation is written for a given species of grain and @xmath72 is the black body emission .",
    "@xmath73 is the temperature of a given grain within the @xmath74-th sample element , @xmath75 represents the incoming specific intensity on the volume element , written , for the first iteration , as follows : @xmath76.\\ ] ] here @xmath77 is the optical depth between the central source and the @xmath74-th sample element and @xmath78 its distance . at the second iteration the new incoming radiant flux on each grain of a given geometrical element @xmath74 that will enter in the eq .",
    "[ eqn : thrm ] of the thermal equilibrium will be : @xmath79 e^{-\\tau_{ik , e}(\\lambda ) } \\right\\ } \\nonumber   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 indicates the generic volume element and @xmath81 is their total number .",
    "@xmath82 is the total _",
    "specific intensity _ hitting the @xmath80element and coming from both the agn and the dust from the rest of the torus ( scattering plus thermal ) as computed from the previous step .",
    "these calculations are iteratively repeated until the difference in the temperature value between two steps falls below one kelvin for each grain species in each volume element . if such small variations do not have big influence on the final result when dealing with relatively low ",
    "density environments , it is important to achieve a good convergence when dealing with high optical depth tori , to avoid losses of energy due to the numerical method adopted .    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "this work describes an improved model for the emission of dusty tori around agn , including features already occasionally discussed in the literature and paying particular attention to an accurate computation of the radiative transfer solution .",
    "the chosen torus geometry is simple but realistic , a flared torus defined by its inner and outer radii and the total opening angle .",
    "we adopt the dust grain distribution of @xcite , with the density depending on the torus radial coordinate and polar angle .",
    "the optical depth is computed in great detail , taking into account the different sublimation temperatures for silicate and graphite grains .",
    "the fact that grains with different sizes can have different sublimation temperatures may imply a significant complication , especially in the inner parts of the torus where the temperature of some dust grains can reach and exceed the sublimation limit . while this model accounts for the differences between graphite and silicate grains , we assume the sublimation temperature to be independent of the grain size .",
    "this follows @xcite , who have shown that this effect is not of much importance especially for high densities and optical depths .",
    "our model is able to reproduce with remarkable accuracy the observed broad - band seds of a variety of agn , for which large numbers of photometric measurements were available in the literature . for three well - known nearby active galaxies ( circinus , ngc 1068 and mrk 231 ) , the _ iso _ mid - ir spectrum was also available , in which cases both the torus model and the starburst contributions were strongly constrained .",
    "a starburst component is usually required in order to fit the observed sed longward of @xmath83 m , as in most cases a pure agn component is unable to reproduce the observed width of the ir bump . from the objects of our sample ,",
    "only four type-1 sources can be fitted by a pure agn emission in the far - ir .",
    "the torus emission is in general predominant for such objects , while the starburst prevails in type-2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : props ] , left panel ) .    in this work",
    "we pay particular attention to the behaviour of the @xmath7 m silicate feature , which in many previous publications was found to challenge the unified model ( especially for type-1 objects ) .",
    "the problem was the prominence of the feature in absorption for type-2 agn and its absence in type-1 objects , as viewed pole - on . this feature arises from dust situated in the innermost regions of the torus , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : elements ] , were the temperature is close to the sublimation limit . moving far away from the center the feature becomes gradually fainter untill it eventually turns into absorption if the optical depth is high enough .",
    "our current results show that a combination of high optical depth , moderate torus radius , an either constant density profile or one radially increasing toward the center , and a proper consideration of the lower sublimation temperature of silicate grains , reduces the silicate emission or even turns it into slight absorption . under these assumptions ,",
    "a standard composition of the mixture of dust turns out to be entirely compatible with low or no silicate emission in our model .",
    "the addition of a significant starburst contribution with the silicate feature in absorption tends to further decrease the prominence of the @xmath7 m feature in type-1 agn .",
    "recent observations with the spitzer ir space telescope have revealed , for the first time , evidence for the silicate feature in moderate emission in a few type-1 agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with values of the @xmath84 parameter close to unity .",
    "indeed , the latter can be achieved with several combinations of our torus parameters ( see fig . [",
    "fig : silfeat1 ] ) .",
    "we present in figs .",
    "[ fig:3c249.1 ] and [ fig : pg0804 ] a detailed comparison of ir spitzer spectra , together with sed data in the optical and far - ir , of two quasars-1 ( 3c249.1 and pg0804 + 761 ) with evidence for the @xmath7 m feature in emission .",
    "we see that our model provides an excellent fit of the spectral shape and broad - band data for the latter source . as for the former ,",
    "the spectrum is also well reproduced , except for a slight shift in wavelength probably due to a locally different grain mixture @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", we find no need for particular geometries , like a tapered disc , or for modified distributions of the silicate grains ( clumpy tori ) in order to suppress the silicate feature in type-1 sources .",
    "we now discuss results related to the unified scheme .",
    "[ fig : props ] ( right panel ) illustrates the best - fit values of the parameters reproducing the observed sed of type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "non - constant dust density profiles , in particular a density decreasing with the distance from the center , are clearly favored .",
    "furthermore , high values for the equatorial optical depths are required in almost all the sources , particularly to suppress the @xmath7 m emission .",
    "interestingly , in agreement with the predictions of the unified scheme and despite the different average distances for the type-1 and type-2 samples , the distributions of the geometrical and physical torus parameters do not show significant variation between the two populations .    also the distribution of values for the mass of dust in the torus and the luminosity of the primary power source presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : props2 ] do not show dramatic differences between type-1 and type-2 .",
    "the slight tendency of type-1 objects to host more luminous agn and more massive tori may be explained with the malmquist bias introduced by the different average distances .",
    "more problematic is , instead , the interpretation of the higher fraction of the agn contribution in type-1 sources , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : props ] ( left panel ) .",
    "it is unclear whether this is still due to a distance - induced bias , or if it is reflecting an intrinsic differentiation of the two populations .",
    "obviously , not only the silicate feature , but more in general the observed mid - ir spectral shape can effectively constrain the intrinsic properties of the circum - nuclear dust distribution .",
    "an illustration of this is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pg0804b ] , showing how the spectrum changes by reducing the torus full - opening angle @xmath14 from @xmath30 to @xmath29 and @xmath28 : the reduced amount of cold dust close to @xmath15 for the 60@xmath85 case makes the spectrum very flat in flux density units from @xmath86 3 to @xmath87 m , whereas a much steeper one is produced by our more standard value of @xmath88 .",
    "a further important implication of our work is that , even accounting for important starburst contributions to the longer - wavelength far - ir part , our code was essentially unable to obtain good spectral fits to both agn classes by assuming relatively flat tori with low values of the opening angle @xmath89 .",
    "instead roughly half of the type-1 agn and @xmath90 per cent of the type-2 require almost cylindrical tori with @xmath88 . for these ,",
    "the corresponding covering factor is @xmath91 per cent , while the remaining sources are better fit with @xmath92 models , corresponding to @xmath93 percent covering factor .",
    "altogether the average covering factor for our local sample is close to @xmath94 percent : 4 to 5 obscured agns are then to be expected on average for each type-1 unobscured object ( we predict very thick circum - nuclear material [ @xmath95 ) . since local and high - z agn samples  including those selected in the ir ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) or in radio ( @xcite , but see also @xcite )  do not typically reveal such a high incidence of obscured objects , it remains that a large number of completely obscured agn are to be expected , undistinguishable from normal galaxies if observed in the optical / near - ir or soft x - rays .",
    "this appears consistent with the results of @xcite from a deep combined spitzer / chandra survey . as discussed there",
    "( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , an important fraction of the obscured quasars and agn may escape identification , even with a good coverage of the mid- and far - ir spectrum , as given by the spitzer data , or deep hard x - ray data .      inevitably , our solutions for the circum - nuclear dust structures in agns suffer some degree of degeneracy in the parameter space .",
    "in our case , the largest source of uncertainty is the limited spectral coverage , especially in the mid - ir . as already shown for the three proto - type objects analysed in sects .",
    "4.1.1 , 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 , the mid - ir spectrum turns out to be foundamental constraining the model parameters of agn dust tori .",
    "the shape of the mid - ir ( @xmath96 m ) continuum is ruled by the optical depth and the characteristics of the density law , while the shape of the far - ir sed ( @xmath97 m ) is mainly determined by the torus size and the amount of cold dust .    in order to study the degree of degeneracy of our fits , a detailed case - study of the following three objects",
    "was performed : pg1411 + 442 , as representative of type-1 objects with no evident starburst contribution , mrk 1513 as a type-1 source with significant contribution from starburst emission in the ir , and ngc 1614 as a representative of the type-2 sources .",
    "we have compared the observed seds for the three sources with all model spectra corresponding to the whole parameter set in table [ tab : mod_grid ] , and then considered the solutions with a reduced @xmath98 below @xmath99 .",
    "the accretion luminosity turned out to be the best constrained quantity , especially in the type-1 sources where the primary continuum emission is observable .",
    "the scatter was found to be somewhat larger for the type-2 ngc 1614 , in which case it varied between @xmath100 and @xmath101 erg / s , the higher values corresponding to model solutions with smaller torus opening angles .",
    "the values of the outer radius were fairly constant for the best fit models in ngc 1614 , but differed by up to a factor of 3 in the case of pg1411 + 442 ( both @xmath34 and @xmath35 gave acceptable fits ) .",
    "similar results were obtained for the mass of dust .",
    "the most extreme case was again pg1411 + 442 , with a variation by up to a factor of 4 , as a consequence of the @xmath102 variation .",
    "on the other hand , the parameters of the dust density law ( equatorial optical depth and the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 of the density law ) were found to only slightly vary among the best fits .",
    "the starburst template that better fitted the objects was arp 220 and was kept fixed as no acceptable fits could be obtained with other templates .    in conclusion , the available data are not so detailed to allow resolution of all degeneracies in the torus parameters , which we may understand if we consider the complexity of the objects under scrutiny and the fact that the torus and starburst emissions overlap smoothly in the far - ir .",
    "however , our analysis has shown that significant constraints can be achieved about the characteristics of the circum - nuclear dust distributions in agns .",
    "this research makes use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ."
