    "justification of the principles of the equilibrium statistical mechanics is still a controversial problem . for example , the widespread scenario of obtaining the microcanonical ensemble from the ergodicity is not applicable to macroscopic systems , because the `` ergodic time '' is too long @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative way to justify the use of the microcanonical ensemble for macroscopic quantum systems .",
    "the main point is that what we really observe can be written in a rather simple combination of local observables .",
    "for example , a macroscopic observable is additive @xcite , and hence written as a sum of local observables on a proper scale .",
    "therefore we can ignore correlations among macroscopic number of points .    considering this limitation of observables ,",
    "we show that almost all pure states in a energy shell look very similar .",
    "therefore we expect that the system go through only typical states with high probability in the course of the time evolution and thus thermal equilibrium is achieved",
    ". note that strong assumptions on the dynamics like ergodicity or mixing are not necessary for a system to reach equilibrium in our picture .",
    "it is possible even for an integrable system to reach equilibrium , as has been pointed out in some earlier numerical works @xcite .",
    "it is known that a typical pure state is highly ( almost maximally ) entangled in many senses @xcite . on the other hand , a thermal state is thought to have no or little amount of entanglement . however , there is no contradiction between the two viewpoints . from our standpoint ,",
    "a thermal state is a highly entangled state , whose entanglement is too complicated to recognize . in this sense",
    ", we can say that too much entanglement is no entanglement .",
    "to explain the idea more clearly , we introduce the bloch vector as a tool to represent quantum states .",
    "let @xmath0 be the hilbert space of the system whose dimension is @xmath1 , and @xmath2 the set of traceless hermitian operators ( i.e. , observables ) on it .",
    "we choose an orthonormal basis set @xmath3 of @xmath2 .",
    "then the bloch vector of a state is defined as @xmath4 in this paper , we normalize the basis as @xmath5 so that the normalization condition for local observables does not depend on the system size . the density matrix @xmath6 and the bloch vector @xmath7 are related as @xmath8 we use the @xmath9 norm for the bloch vector @xmath10 which is related to the hilbert - schmidt norm for the density matrix as @xmath11 the set of the bloch vectors is a subset of a ball with radius @xmath12 in @xmath13 .",
    "pure states are on the surface of the ball , and mixed states are in the interior . at the center ,",
    "there is the completely mixed state which is represented by the zero - vector @xmath14 .",
    "we consider a macroscopic system composed of @xmath15 sites , and define a linear subspace of @xmath2 as @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is a positive integer much smaller than @xmath15 but still a macroscopic number , and @xmath18 is the basis of local operators at a site @xmath19 .",
    "we normalize the local observables as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the dimension of the local hilbert space .",
    "@xmath22 contains practically all observables of physical relevance .",
    "for example , it contains all macroscopic observables and their low - order moments .",
    "we also define a projection operator for the bloch vector @xmath23 : @xmath24 is the set of expectation values of all basis elements of @xmath22 .    we pick up a pure state in @xmath25}$ ] , which is a subspace of the hilbert space spanned by eigenvectors @xmath26 with @xmath27 . a state in @xmath25}$ ]",
    "is written as @xmath28\\}$ ] . if we choose the coefficients @xmath29 randomly , the following inequality holds .",
    "@xmath30 here , @xmath31}$ ] and the overline represents the ensemble average over all states in @xmath32}$ ] . with use of chebyshev s inequality , one can also show @xmath33 for any @xmath34 .",
    "as the system size @xmath15 increases , the density of states increases exponentially but @xmath35 increases only in polynomial order @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the rhs of ( [ variance ] ) is exponentially small for a macroscopic system , which means that the portion of states practically distinguishable from the microcanonical ensemble is exponentially small .    to prove ( [ variance ] ) , we first prove the following important lemma @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denotes the spectral norm of @xmath40 . when we take the ensemble average over @xmath32}$ ] , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 @xcite . up to the 4-th order ,",
    "all other combinations vanish identically . therefore @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath46 substituting ( [ result ] ) to ( [ intermediate ] ) , we obtain ( [ lemma ] ) .",
    "then , since @xmath47 for any basis element of ( [ basis ] ) , we obtain ( [ variance ] ) .",
    "if we consider a small subsystem which consists of less than @xmath17 sites , all observables in the subsystem is contained in @xmath22 . since the microcanonical ensemble average of the density matrix of a subsystem is the canonical ensemble in thermodynamically normal systems , ( [ variance ] ) gives a justification of the canonical ensemble for a small subsystem .",
    "our idea can be illustrated clearly with a time - dependent spin model .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian , @xmath48 which is a time dependent version of the hamiltonian used in @xcite .",
    "details of this hamiltonian is not important here .",
    "the point is that the time evolution is deterministic and there is no constant of motion in this system .",
    "if we start with a pure state , the state is always pure and the length of the bloch vector is the maximum value @xmath49 .",
    "however , the bloch vector has so many components that we never see all of them . when we see only small number of components , the bloch vector looks like the zero - vector with very high probability because the average absolute value of each component is very small .",
    "therefore the system looks like in the completely mixed state , which is the equilibrium state expected from the principle of equal a priori probabilities .",
    "note , however , that the equilibrium is obtained not from any kind of averaging , but from the limitation of observables .",
    "[ fig ] is the plot of @xmath17-body part of the bloch vector @xmath50 .",
    "the initial state is a product state , which has relatively large components for small @xmath17 . in particular ,",
    "the one - body part takes the maximum value @xmath51 . after some time evolution @xmath52",
    "approaches quickly to the average value @xmath53 , which is very small if @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the system looks like in the completely mixed state ."
