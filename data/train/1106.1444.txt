    "second , the census of igm metals provides a unique and independent constraint on the integrated amount of star formation in our universe ; indeed , the metal census within galaxies falls significantly short of the expectations from cosmic star formation , which is known as the `` missing metals problem '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "owing to cosmic expansion , a given column density @xmath25 system traces a higher overdensity at lower redshifts  @xcite ; a similar trend , modulated by evolving photo - ionisation rates , also exists for metals .",
    "one consequence of these effects is that summing the column densities of metal lines to find an integrated ion density ( @xmath26 ) does not necessarily translate into a global metallicity ( @xmath27 ) .",

    "the metallicity of an ejected wind particle is the metallicity of the sph particle at the time of ejection .",
    "sph particles are continually self - enriched while they are eligible for star formation . in this scheme , both ejected winds and newly formed stars have the metallicity of the sph particle at the time of the ejection or formation event ; wind particles are essentially ejected ism sph particles . note that only particles above the critical star - formation density threshold are eligible to form stars or to become launched as a wind .",
    "cooling , which is never suppressed , invariably allows the launched winds to cool and maintain a temperature of @xmath63 k while decoupled .",
    "once the hydrodynamic forces are restored , which always occurs deep inside haloes given the two criteria listed above , the sph particle interacts normally . in practice ,",
    "re - coupled wind particles show a bimodal behaviour : ( i ) they shock heat to temperatures above the peak cooling efficiencies for metal - enriched gas ( @xmath64 k ) , or ( ii ) they shock heat to a lower temperature where metal - line cooling is efficient and then rapidly cool to @xmath10 k. the most important determining factor appears to be @xmath48 , which we will show when we consider igm enrichment patterns among the different wind models in  [ sec : metphys ] .      our naming convention for our simulations continues the precedent we established in our recent papers : r[boxsize]n[number of particles per side][wind model ] , where the initial letter `` r '' indicates the particular choice of cosmology above .",

    "recall from d10 that the mass fraction of the whim in this model increases from @xmath113 during this time , while the fraction in the diffuse gas drops from @xmath114 .",
    "hence overall , the fraction of metals in the igm ( i.e. diffuse+whim ) drops , a trend that is accentuated in the diffuse phase by a drop in the baryonic mass fraction in this phase , while for the whim the trend is countered by an increasing mass fraction .",
    "the decrease in the igm metal fraction is balanced by an increase in the metal fraction in galaxies , from half at @xmath115 to almost @xmath116 at @xmath1 .",
    "hence , from @xmath38 , fractionally the metals move from low - density regions to higher density regions .",

    "still , these @xmath1 numbers are not large ; in all the wind models more metals are outside of galaxies at high-@xmath87 .",

    "the central result is that most cosmic metals are not in hot gas , either in the whim or hot halo gas . at @xmath1 , the igm metallicity distribution for all wind models",

    "few metals reside in between @xmath119  k and @xmath120  k ( except in the cw case ) because metal - line cooling is very efficient there , causing metal enriched gas to rapidly transition through these temperatures ( od09 ) . in  [ sec : mixing ] , we state that the bimodality is stronger in our simulations compared to simulations that explicitly smooth metals , because metals confined to individual sph particles cool more rapidly over this intermediate temperature range .",
    "the density histograms along the bottom of figure [ fig : zphasespaces ] for the vzw model ( left panels ) show a peak in metal fraction at @xmath121 at all redshifts .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is relevant for the igm because it shows that the material expelled from galaxies has near - solar metallicities at all epochs .",

    "the metal fraction of the igm phases ( diffuse+whim ) generally drops from @xmath123 in the wind models .",
    "this reflects the increasing difficulty that metals have in escaping from the denser regions where they are formed to less dense regions , as depicted in figure  [ fig : zphasespaces ] . while the fraction of metals in the igm phases is generally not large , it is still sufficient to reproduce the observations of metal - line absorbers across cosmic time  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the whim and hot halo phases , the @xmath104 threshold that divides these two phases , first introduced in d10 , makes a stark difference in the whim metal content compared to previous whim definitions without such a density threshold .",
    "the whim , which contains 24% of @xmath1 vzw baryons , holds only 1.2% of the @xmath1 metals and remains steady at [ z / h]@xmath124 since @xmath125 .",
    "the whim forms through shock - heating owing to the gravitational collapse of large - scale structures @xcite while metal - enriching galactic outflows contribute fractionally less to the whim at late times @xcite .",
    "the metal content of the hot halo phase steadily increases , and by @xmath1 it holds more metals than the combined igm phases ( cf .",
    "5.2% vs. 3.9% for vzw ) .",
    "the @xmath94-axis histograms for the vzw model clearly show the growing importance of hot halo metals from @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath1 panel indicates that most of these metals are at @xmath126 k and hence are in the intragroup or intracluster medium ( icm ) . in all the wind models , the hot halo metallicity reaches 0.1  @xmath98 at @xmath1 , but it also shows a density gradient such that the portion that would emit most strongly in x - rays has [ z / h]@xmath127 ( see figure  [ fig : zphasespaces ] ) .",
    "this is comparable to the measured metallicity of the icm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "four wind models are shown : solid blue- no - wind , dashed green- momentum - conserved winds , dotted red- constant winds , and long - dashed orange- slow winds . ]",
    "more broadly , the fraction of metals in the igm increases at very early epochs as winds enrich diffuse cosmic gas  @xcite , but then at later epochs the metals do not escape their haloes so easily or else re - accrete back into haloes . hence , the metal fraction in the diffuse phase peaks at @xmath128 in these wind models ( figure  [ fig : zevol ] ) . meanwhile , the metallicity in all the phases increases , but slowly ; the most rapid increase is in the condensed phase gas , since this halo gas continues to be enriched even to late times by outflows .",
    "these trends , while generally true , are in certain aspects quite sensitive to the wind model , as we will discuss next .",
    "the value of studying enrichment patterns lies in their high sensitivity to galactic winds , upon which the process of galaxy formation heavily depends ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we now contrast our vzw simulation to the three other wind models .",
    "the no - wind model produces nearly twice as many stars and metals as any wind model , and is incapable of enriching the diffuse igm appreciably at any redshift , leaving it mostly pristine even by @xmath1 ( figure  [ fig : zphasespaces ] , upper right ) . the necessity to enrich the diffuse igm to levels of at least [ z / h ] @xmath129 at @xmath130 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite showed that their no - wind model reached observationally reasonable [ fe / h ] abundances via delayed type ia sne from intragroup / intracluster stars , but [ o / h ] abundances were too low compared to observations and the baryonic fraction in stars was too high .",
    "overall , the no - wind model strongly fails to match basic observations of both galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the igm .",
    "the constant wind ( cw ) model has a high wind speed of @xmath133 emanating from every galaxy , which pushes shock - heated metals into voids .",
    "this leads to a whim metal mass fraction more than 10 times higher than any other model ( figure  [ fig : zevol ] , middle panel ) .",
    "these metals remain hot , because adiabatic cooling from hubble expansion is not sufficient to return this gas to the photo - ionised igm equation of state ( eos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within a hubble time . the excess heating is also reflected in the phase space diagram for this wind model ( figure  [ fig : zphasespaces ] , lower right ) , which has a high - metallicity peak in underdense regions at @xmath134  k. the fast winds also increase the whim baryon percentage from 23 to 33% ( compared to the nw model ) , whereas the vzw and sw models increase the whim baryonic fraction by one tenth as much , a 1% increase ( d10 ) .",
    "as @xcite show , a similar model with somewhat lower wind speeds ( @xmath57 ) produces @xmath3 absorbers at @xmath135 that are are too wide compared to the observations , indicating that there is too much igm heating at this early epoch .     for the four models : momentum - conserved winds ( vzw ) , no winds ( nw ) , constant winds ( cw ) , and slow winds ( sw ) .",
    "]    the slow wind ( sw ) model with @xmath136 does not overly heat the early igm , and in some sense represents a hybrid of the vzw model ( similar average wind velocities ) and the cw model ( same mass loading ) . like cw , this model creates a concentration of shock - heated metals ( @xmath137 k ) in voids , but it is at lower temperatures and is much less prominent owing to the sw model s lower wind speeds . in this",
    "model low - mass galaxies eject winds at high velocities relative to their escape velocity and high - mass galaxies , typically in dense environments , eject winds at less than the escape velocity .",
    "hence , the sw model can not populate the icm with metals and , therefore , the metal phase space diagram in this regime mimics that of the no - wind model .    in the vzw model , winds from small galaxies have lower velocities .",
    "hence they deposit metals at higher densities where metal - line cooling is efficient and can return these metals to @xmath10 k. in hot gas , the vzw model produces a strong metallicity - density gradient by @xmath1 owing to its high outflow velocities from massive galaxies .",
    "winds with @xmath138 speeds emanating from these galaxies rarely escape the halo owing to the intervening halo gas , but they do shock heat to temperatures high enough that the cooling times are long , and hence the metals do not re - accrete onto the galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : rhoz ] shows the mean metallicity - density relation in our four wind models from @xmath139 .",

    "all the wind models show increased metallicities at all the plotted overdensities relative to the no - wind case .",
    "the constant wind model results in a curious upturn in the mean metallicity at void densities ( @xmath140 ) , which is a generic feature of strong feedback models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * their figure 24 ) .",

    "the slow wind model has a less pronounced upturn , and it shows a less widespread metal distribution particularly at early epochs owing to its lower wind speed .",
    "the vzw model shows an interesting trend with overdensity , and the metallicity in filaments ( @xmath141 ) is nearly time - invariant .",
    "continual enrichment from galaxies pumps metals into these regions , but this is approximately balanced by gravitational effects that draw the metals back closer to galaxies and by the accretion of more pristine gas . at higher overdensities , the mean metallicity increases with time , while at sub - mean densities , metals slowly diffuse deeper into voids @xcite .",
    "the differences between the models offer an opportunity to probe outflows if the metallicity - density relation and its evolution can be reliably measured , which is a central goal of igm enrichment observations .",
    "overall , the evolution of metal content by phase shows much more dependence on feedback than our corresponding study of the abundance of baryons by phase ( d10 ) .",
    "while all the wind models significantly suppress the global star formation rate and hence metal production , the distribution of metals in the igm shows clear differences .",
    "the velocity of the outflow and its motion through the ambient gas determines to what temperature the gas is shock heated and to what overdensity it reaches .",
    "gas in sufficiently dense regions cools quickly , particularly since it is enriched .",
    "hence , the outflow parameters critically determine the enrichment history of baryons outside of galaxies , providing an opportunity to constrain such parameters based on observations of igm metal lines .",
    "a generic feature of our igm enrichment models is that they have a very early epoch where metals are distributed outwards into the igm , but over most of cosmic time the newly produced metals became confined to ever decreasing regions around the galaxies that produced them .",
    "we call this  outside - in \" igm enrichment , and it has consequences not just for how metals enrich the igm , but for how wind material re - accretes onto galaxies @xcite .    we have already seen trends exemplifying outside - in enrichment above .",
    "the metal mass fraction in the igm decreases steadily since @xmath135 , and the peak overdensity of metals increases with time .",
    "@xcite showed that the median distance reached by vzw outflows ( with a wide dispersion ) is @xmath142  physical kpc , implying widespread enrichment ( in a comoving sense ) early on and more confined enrichment at later epochs .",
    "the evolution of the vzw metallicity - density relationship in figure [ fig : rhoz ] ( top panel ) shows that metals are in place at igm overdensities at @xmath143 and that the metallicity is mostly invariant and actually declines slightly at @xmath144 from @xmath38 .",
    "newly produced metals are mostly confined to their own haloes and fall back onto their parent galaxies primarily from these overdensities ; however winds continue to enrich igm densities until @xmath1 , especially the winds from lower mass galaxies , often even reaching void densities .",
    "additionally , some enriched whim material also falls into galaxy haloes and eventually onto the central galaxy .",
    "another view of outside - in enrichment is provided by the age of @xmath1 metals as a function of overdensity , shown in figure [ fig : rhoageomega ] , top panel .",
    "we define the metal age as the time since a wind particle has most recently been launched , which is a good indicator of the age for metals in the igm as these baryons are almost entirely enriched by winds .",
    "the median age of wind - blown metals is shown by the solid lines , and the 16 and 84% cuts are indicated by the dashed lines for the vzw model .",
    "figure [ fig : rhoageomega ] shows directly that lower overdensities are enriched earlier , particularly in the vzw model . for this model ,",
    "the typical age of metals in voids is @xmath145  gyr , reaching a minimum of @xmath146  gyr at overdensities of a few thousand .",
    "the constant-@xmath46 models show less dependence on age with overdensity in the igm , though at higher overdensities the metal ages are again significantly younger .",
    "the evolution of the metallicity - density relation of the cw model ( figure [ fig : rhoz ] ) shows a significantly increasing metallicity within voids with time .",
    "most metals were already in place at higher redshift in gas that continues to expand into voids by @xmath1 , but galaxies continue to enrich void overdensities below @xmath147 .",
    "the same trends are true for the sw model , but they are shifted to higher overdensities and younger ages owing to its weaker winds . while the median age trends with overdensity are statistically significant and indicative of the history of metal enrichment , the larger scatter in all models at most densities prohibits a direct mapping of an overdensity to an age for a given wind model .",
    "@xcite find a similar age - density anti - correlation using their definition of mean enrichment redshift .",
    "our definition of age is a lower limit compared to theirs , because we measure the most recent wind launch as opposed to the redshift - weighted enrichment age .",
    "both methods will find similar ages for wind particles that rapidly enrich and launch once , as is typical for metals that escape galaxies at high-@xmath87 , but we will find significantly younger ages for winds that recycle back onto galaxies and have multiple wind launches and enrichment epochs .     as a function of density ( solid lines ) with the 16th and 84th percentage cuts ( dashed lines , vzw only ) for the momentum - conserved winds ( vzw , green ) , constant winds ( cw , red ) , and slow winds ( sw , orange ) .",

    "this occurs because for strong saturated lines , which preferentially receive the largest turbulent contributions , autovp  tends to fit a higher column density given only a single line with no doublet information .",

    "@xmath5 shows a particularly steep column density distribution owing to a preponderance of weak photo - ionised lines , motivating deep observations to detect this interesting igm tracer .",
    "the cosmic metal density is generally constant from @xmath202 , in contrast to its marked rise from @xmath203  @xcite , and this is broadly reflected in the constancy of @xmath26 for most ions over this redshift range .",
    "component linewidths ( @xmath86-parameters ) are also fit with autovp , but are almost always dominated by the cos lsf ( the instrumental @xmath204 ) ; therefore , linewidths are often much wider than they are in stis data .",

    "the linewidths of the three wind models are nearly identical .",
    "the cos lsf makes it difficult to determine temperatures from thermal broadening in our case since we show in the next section that the majority of our absorbers are near @xmath10 k , corresponding to linewidths much smaller than the lsf .",

    "turbulent broadening is independent of the atomic species , and the broader linewidths for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are a result of the od09 turbulence model , which adds wider @xmath159 to higher density gas .",

    "the shortfall of strong @xmath154 components was part of the motivation for od09 to attempt the vzw - turb model ( the other motivation being mismatched linewidths ) .",
    "the vzw - turb makes less of a difference between the two types of ewds , because turbulent broadening increases the component @xmath154s so that the strongest component of a system becomes more dominant relative to weaker components ; thus the strongest component more likely sets the system @xmath154 resulting in less differences between the two methods .",
    "the trend of this model s component and system ewds matches that of @xcite , although we appear to consistently over - estimate component and system frequencies at @xmath208 m .",
    "the comparison to @xcite is more difficult because their search relies on the identification of the associated @xmath25 absorption , but their measurements appear consistent with @xcite systems .",

    "we now link the observed metal - line absorber characteristics with their physical conditions just as we did for @xmath20 absorbers in  5 of d10 .",

    "for example , the mismatch of @xmath3 density histograms in denser halo gas indicates that summing the halo @xmath3 absorbers ( red ) underestimates the true @xmath28 arising from this phase ( grey ) .",
    "the temperature histograms show that most of this missing absorption is between @xmath214 k. the same is true for @xmath4 probing even higher densities ( not shown ) .",
    "the main cause for this is that saturated absorbers tracing halo gas have their column densities underestimated without turbulent broadening , which is apparent in the differences between the vzw and vzw - turb cdds in figure [ fig : cdd ] .",
    "the mismatch is less severe but still noticeable for @xmath2 .    at @xmath90 ,",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath2 predominantly trace the cooler phases of gas at temperatures closer to @xmath117 k than @xmath119 k. @xmath36 ( not shown ) traces the same temperatures , but at intermediate overdensities between @xmath3 and @xmath2 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "this is in marked contrast to some previous work @xcite , all of whom find most of their @xmath2 at @xmath215 k at the same redshifts .",
    "we believe it is the interplay of our momentum - conserved winds with the cooling rates in the @xmath216  k regime that results in our differing conclusion .",
    "we will show in  [ sec : zcool ] that using the photo - ionised metal - line cooling rates of @xcite does not fundamentally change the phase space traced by @xmath2 absorbers in our vzw model .",
    "hence , we reiterate the conclusion by @xcite that , for a physically well - constrained outflow model , @xmath2 primarily traces diffuse , photo - ionised metals .",
    "we show two higher ionisation species , @xmath5 and @xmath14 , at @xmath210 , because this is the redshift where cos is able to observe these lines .",
    "the @xmath14 doublet at 499.3,521.1  falls into the cos sensitivity range at @xmath217 , but we show simulated absorbers and phase space centred at @xmath210 because these characteristics are not strongly evolving .",
    "@xmath14 has a larger fraction of mass arising from collisional ionisation at densities corresponding mostly to halo gas .",
    "surprisingly , most simulated @xmath5 absorbers are predicted to be photo - ionised , tracing overdensities of around @xmath218 .",
    "however , the strongest simulated absorber is at @xmath219 tracing @xmath220 k gas , and is likely more representative of the three @xmath5 absorbers @xcite already observed , since it has a similar column density and hence probably a similar environment .",
    "@xcite find a 0.25 @xmath221 galaxy at an impact parameter of 73 @xmath222 at nearly the same redshift as the @xmath223 @xmath5 absorber along the he0226 - 4110 sight line , suggesting that this absorption originates in collisionally ionised halo gas .",
    "they further suggest that the origin is a conductive interface between cool clouds moving through a hot medium , based on the alignment of @xmath5 with lower ionisation species , something that would not be captured in our simulations .",

    "we emphasise that our model predicts numerous weaker @xmath5 absorbers tracing the diffuse photo - ionised component , as a separate and probably as yet undetected population .",
    "these absorbers are mainly below @xmath227 ( cf .",

    "alignment with @xmath25 absorbers tracing overdensities of @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath231 at @xmath232 , is common for the photo - ionised @xmath5 absorbers .",

    "@xcite estimates a higher frequency below @xmath233 , although their estimate is based on one absorber and is highly uncertain .",
    "additionally , we predict a mass density of @xmath200 at @xmath210 almost @xmath234 times higher than at @xmath90 , which is suggestive of an even greater frequency of such absorbers at high redshift ; the increase is primarily from the increased neon traced in the photo - ionised component . given their distinct phase spaces ( hot halo and dense whim vs. diffuse ) , the potential for absorber bimodality is greater than for @xmath2 , but identifying it may require direct observation of an absorber s environment .",
    "we will return to this discussion in a future paper discussing the galaxy - absorber connection .",
    "it may initially be surprising that high ionisation species such as @xmath5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 can be excited via photo - ionisation given their high ionisation potentials , but the existence of such absorbers is straightforwardly traceable to the shape of the @xcite background .",

    "our simulated photo - ionised @xmath5 absorbers are stronger than this owing to the inhomogeneous enrichment , which results in higher metallicities for the detected absorbers , and furthermore arise at slightly higher densities owing to the positive metallicity - density gradient present in the vzw models @xcite .",

    "while likely rare and exceedingly difficult , would provide the most unambiguous uv tracer of hot halo gas at @xmath238 k.      the phase space traced by @xmath2 at @xmath90 is shown for the constant , slow , and no - wind models in figure [ fig : zmodelionphase ] . while the cw model appears qualitatively similar to vzw with most absorbers being diffuse and photo - ionised , there are significantly fewer absorbers at @xmath239 .",
    "stronger outflows create fewer strong absorbers , because metals preferentially reach lower overdensities where they can not rapidly cool .",
    "even though the igm is generally hotter in this model relative to vzw , absorbers still remain predominantly photo - ionised . despite the metal content of the cw whim being @xmath240 times higher than in the vzw model , the limited phase space traced by the @xmath2",
    "does not probe this enrichment , which can only be directly detected in species with x - ray transitions ( e.g. @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) .",
    "slow winds produce @xmath2 statistics nearly indistinguishable from the vzw model as reflected in the phase space plot .",
    "this same simulation produces a similar @xmath29 galactic stellar mass function to the vzw model below @xmath83 @xcite , thus the match with the @xmath2 statistics is consistent with sub-@xmath83 galaxies producing the @xmath2 absorbers ( od09 ) .",
    "the no - wind simulation shows that winds are required to enrich the diffuse igm ; no absorbers exist in this phase .",
    "overall , the conclusion that the @xmath2 detected by cos ( at least under the s / n assumptions here ) will be predominantly photo - ionised is robust to variations in the wind model and the cooling rates ( as we will show in  [ sec : zcool ] ) .",
    "even @xmath5 , at columns just below what is currently accessible , becomes dominated by photo - ionised absorbers .",
    "@xmath14 at cos sensitivities probes hot gas , but not at low whim densities , and anyway these lines should be rare . a key conclusion from this work",
    "is that the bulk of the diffuse collisionally ionised whim gas , i.e. the so - called missing baryons , is only traceable through high ionisation x - ray transitions .",
    "we will explore such x - ray absorption in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the central theme in our exploration of the physical conditions of metal absorbers is the complex link between the enrichment patterns of metals and their observational tracers .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , even when one uses equation [ equ : omega ] to sum the observed absorbers to find the cosmic density of a particular ion , @xmath243 , this does not necessarily yield the true physical mass density of that ion .",
    "we compare the mass - weighted cosmic ion density summed via the contribution of every sph particle outside of galaxies , @xmath244 ( the grey shading in figure [ fig : zionphase ] ) to @xmath243 ( equation [ equ : omega ] , the volume - weighted observational probe represented by the coloured circles for individual absorbers ) .",

    "we present the ewds and cdds for all but the cw-16 model along with the 48 @xmath82 vzw simulation in the second panels of figures [ fig : ew_ovi ] and [ fig : cdd_ovi ] , respectively .",
    "the vzw-16 simulation is statistically identical to the larger vzw simulation for all @xmath2 observations .",
    "this comes as no surprise because od09 demonstrated that @xmath2 is mostly associated with low - mass , @xmath273 , galaxies , which are well sampled in both volumes .",
    "this justifies using the smaller volume to explore these physical variations .    comparing the vzw-16 and vzw - pi simulation",
    ", there exists 70% as much @xmath2 absorption in the latter , specifically @xmath197 , @xmath274 versus @xmath275 , with the reduction evenly distributed in column density ( figure [ fig : cdd_ovi ] , middle panel ) .",
    "examination of the @xmath2 phase space for vzw - pi in figure [ fig : ophase_cool ] ( upper left panel ) reveals that most of the @xmath2 absorption still arises from the diffuse @xmath2 phase . however , there are subtle differences compared to the standard vzw model ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "the locus of cool metals at @xmath276 ( i.e. @xmath277 ) is no longer flat at @xmath63 k , below which cie metal - line cooling no longer contributes , but declines from @xmath278 k to below @xmath117 k for increasing overdensity as seen also in owls ( cf .",
    "* their figure 1 ) .",
    "@xmath2 absorbers , therefore , trace somewhat hotter temperatures , but are still within the diffuse phase .",
    "somewhat more @xmath2 exists in the whim phase owing to this less efficient cooling , but still only a handful of identified absorbers actually trace this phase .",
    "examining the two different cooling models in the cw simulations reveals much larger differences ( figure [ fig : ophase_cool ] , right panels ) ; @xmath197 declines by a factor of almost three using pi cooling , from @xmath279 to @xmath280 .",
    "the main difference is that cw winds push metals to lower overdensities where photo - ionisation plays a larger role in retarding cooling .",
    "less oxygen cools below @xmath281 k where photo - ionised @xmath2 ionisation fractions are the largest .    as an aside",
    ", we note that galaxy growth remains relatively unaffected by this change .",
    "the amount of stars formed at @xmath1 is reduced by only 8% using pi cooling relative to cie cooling .",
    "this mostly arises because the reduced metal - line cooling at lower densities hinders the recycling of wind material back into galaxies  @xcite .",
    "a small reduction in overall star formation was also noted by @xcite when making the same comparison in their grid - based simulation ( cf . the red and black curves in their figure  1 ) .    in summary , including photo - ionised cooling rates does not alter our fundamental conclusions about the phases @xmath2 and other absorbers trace in our favoured vzw model  @xmath2 still traces mostly diffuse , photo - ionised gas .",
    "we also demonstrate that using a different wind model ( cw ) , similar to that used by @xcite , produces a much larger change in @xmath2 absorber properties when using photo - ionised metal cooling rates , because this model pushes many more metals into very diffuse gas where the photo - ionised cooling rates have a larger impact .",
    "we note that the vzw model does a much better job than the cw model in fitting the observed @xmath1 galactic stellar mass function below @xmath282 @xcite , from which most @xmath2 absorption arises ( od09 ) .",
    "hence , we favour the vzw model , although our tests do illustrate that the interpretation of observed @xmath2 still could depend on the details of the input physics .",
    "in od09 we introduced a heuristic prescription to add sub - grid turbulent broadening to the @xmath86-parameters of @xmath2 , after the conclusion of the simulation , using specexbin .",
    "this added turbulent broadening is a function of the physical density of the gas .",

    "furthermore , @xmath159 retains its maximum value of @xmath289 at higher densities .",
    "see od09  4.4 for an in - depth discussion of the physical motivation for this model and its relation to the turbulence observed on kpc scales in @xmath3 paired absorbers along lensed quasar sight lines at @xmath290 @xcite .",
    "od09 argue that the turbulence is related to outflows and decays on timescales of the order of a hubble time .",
    "we already showed results for the vzw - turb model in figures [ fig : ew ] through [ fig : ewcompsys ] .",
    "here we combine it with the vzw and cw models with photo - ionised cooling rate ( vzw - turb - pi , cw - turb - pi ) shown in the third panels of figures [ fig : ew_ovi ] and [ fig : cdd_ovi ] .",
    "photo - ionised metal - line cooling rates reduce vzw @xmath2 line frequencies and @xmath197 by the same factor , one - third , either including turbulence or without it .",
    "the vzw - turb - pi model agrees well with the observed @xmath2 cdd and ewd , and better than the vzw - turb model , which over - produces weak @xmath2 absorbers .",
    "the vzw - turb - pi model is our favoured model for @xmath2 as it has the most physically motivated combination of outflows , ionisation background , physical metal - line cooling , and turbulent broadening to explain both @xmath2 and @xmath20 forest observations ( d10 ) , as well as other observations of low-@xmath87 galaxies @xcite .",
    "we show the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 cdds for this model along with the vzw - pi model in figure [ fig : cdd_c4_si4_ne8 ] . as before",
    ", our favoured model continues to overproduce the incidence of the lower - ionisation species .",
    "we do not believe this discrepancy can be mitigated by cosmic variance , because even our @xmath80 box is sufficient to sample the gas and galaxies responsible for the absorption of these ions ( cf . vzw and vzw-16 show nearly identical results ) .",
    "however , the idea of adding turbulent broadening for lower ionisation species that trace higher densities may not be as valid as in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , using lensed quasars probing the @xmath291 igm , @xcite observed sub - kpc sub - structure in lower ionisation species including @xmath3 and @xmath4 that did not exist in @xmath2 .",
    "at low redshifts , all of the @xmath4 and most of the @xmath3 in our models have densities where our turbulence model predicts @xmath292 , but the observations of @xmath3 suggest much narrower linewidths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence @xmath2 may be tracing more diffusely distributed gas that is more affected by large - scale turbulence injected by outflows , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 could be tracing individual high - density cloudlets .",
    "regardless , models both with and without turbulence overpredict the @xmath3 and @xmath4 absorption .    figure [ fig : zionphase_bturb_pi ] shows the phase - space diagram for metals and absorbers in the vzw - turb - pi model .",
    "@xmath4 and stronger @xmath3 absorbers trace much higher densities than @xmath2 .",
    "this results in many more strong @xmath3 and @xmath4 components than in the vzw - pi model , because autovp  finds stronger @xmath85s for otherwise non - broadened saturated profiles and weaker absorbers are subsumed into the stronger ones . the histograms in figure [ fig : zionphase_bturb_pi ] show that these absorbers mostly arise in cool halo gas .",
    "a difficulty with our simulations is that we may not resolve cooling instabilities in the halo gas  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that could result in much of the carbon being in dense cold cloudlets , which would favour lower ionisation states than @xmath3 .",
    "this is in principle easily possible as only 3 - 5% of the carbon outside of galaxies resides in @xmath3 between @xmath157 ( vs. 13 - 15% at @xmath293 ) , and hence a small change in the ionisation rate at @xmath294 ryd could dramatically change the @xmath3 statistics",
    ". it will be interesting to compare our predictions of @xmath33 and @xmath295 to observations when a sufficient sample becomes available , to see if we significantly underpredict the amount of carbon in these states corresponding to our overprediction of @xmath3 .",
    "another possibility is that the @xcite type ii carbon yields we use are too high .",
    "for example , the @xcite carbon yields are @xmath296 dex lower , which could explain some of the differences with respect to the observations .",
    "the agb stellar yields we use can not explain the over - estimate , because carbon production from agb stars is sub - dominant to type ii sne in our simulations @xcite .",
    "yet another potential explanation is that a substantial fraction of carbon and silicon are depleted onto dust , while the more volatile oxygen is not .",

    "@xmath5 traces similar overdensities as @xmath2 and hence should be affected by the same turbulence , and hence the vzw - turb - pi model should be the most appropriate . but",
    "as figure  [ fig : cdd_c4_si4_ne8 ] shows , the predicted column density distributions do not vary significantly with pi cooling or turbulence . in detail , between @xmath158 , @xmath200",
    "slightly increases with pi cooling , but declines by a factor of 20% with the addition of turbulence to @xmath297 , because already weak lines are broadened enough so that autovp  fails to identify them .",
    "most of the @xmath5 absorption still traces photo - ionised gas , but the reduced cooling raises the bulk of @xmath5 absorbers from @xmath298 k to @xmath299 k and leads to 22% compared to 7% of the @xmath5 absorption arising from @xmath300 k gas ( figure  [ fig : zionphase_bturb_pi ] ) .",
    "this percentage could grow even larger if our simulations adequately resolved interfaces between cool and hot gas within haloes , which they do not as we discussed in  [ sec : absphase ] .",
    "we show the cw - turb - pi model to demonstrate that turbulent broadening affects other wind models in much the same way as the vzw model , by making more wide @xmath2 absorbers and slightly fewer weak absorbers ( cf .",
    "cw - pi model ) .",
    "this more appropriate cooling rates applied to the cw model , combined with turbulent broadening to match observed line widths indicates this model far under - produces @xmath2 , especially weaker systems , when compared to observed ewds and cdds .",
    "the degree of metal inhomogeneity in the igm remains highly uncertain , but dynamically very important .",
    "the distribution of metals affects gas cooling , which is critical for galaxy formation because the temperature of the gas determines the efficiency of gas accretion onto galaxies @xcite .",
    "more metal mixing leads to more star formation as more efficient metal - line cooling affects more baryons @xcite . in our simulations , we do not mix metals , and each wind particle retains its own metals as it propagates out of galaxies .    the homogeneity of metals impacts the statistics of absorbers , which we explore here .",
    "we consider two ad hoc models for distributing metals throughout the igm , by replacing particle metallicities in our simulation with prescriptive metallicities in our vzw model . in the first ( vzw - z01 ) ,",
    "we assume a uniform metallicity of @xmath301 in the igm ( vzw - z01 ) , which is the global @xmath1 igm metallicity in our vzw model .",
    "note that this is similar to @xmath24 painted onto earlier simulations to reproduce older observed @xmath2 absorber frequencies @xcite .",
    "the second model ( vzw-0sig ) takes the average [ o / h ] of the vzw model in each @xmath211 dex pixel of phase space ( upper left panel of figure [ fig : ophase_dist ] at @xmath302 ) and paints this metallicity onto all sph particles within that phase space cell , with zero dispersion .",
    "both prescriptions preserve the total metal mass , but neither model is dynamically self - consistent , because metal cooling would alter the physical state of the gas and feedback would have to enrich the baryons in the first place .",
    "however , our purpose here is to explore extreme cases of metal homogeneity to see if absorption line statistics can distinguish the level of metal inhomogeneity .",
    "figures [ fig : ew_ovi ] and [ fig : cdd_ovi ] , bottom panels , show the ewds and the cdds of these models , compared to our original vzw model .",
    "the vzw - z01 model , as found in od09 , produces too many weak absorbers , too few strong absorbers ( in terms of column density ) , and a large alignment fraction with @xmath25 ( figure [ fig : align_ovi ] ) .",
    "collisionally ionised @xmath2 ( @xmath215 k ) accounts for a quarter of @xmath197 and two - thirds of lines above @xmath303 .",
    "simply painting metals onto a simulation uniformly overestimates @xmath2 and other species in cie , because the most commonly observed uv resonance lines ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and soon @xmath5 ) are also some of the most important coolants .",
    "painting the average metallicity by phase space pixels explores how the dispersion in metallicity among sph particles affects the line statistics .",
    "this model shows negligible differences versus the original vzw case , showing that the fact that metals are not mixed in our simulations has no impact on @xmath2 absorber statistics .",
    "we reiterate that this test does not dynamically account for differences in the cooling rates that would result from such metal mixing , and hence it is not self - consistent ; this test isolates the impact of spatial inhomogeneities in the metals .",
    "figure [ fig : ophase_dist ] provides a broader view of metal inhomogeneity in our original vzw simulation .",
    "the upper left shows the oxygen metallicity in phase space , this is similar to figure  [ fig : zphasespaces ] except here we only consider oxygen and the general trends are as before .",
    "the upper right panel shows the fraction of baryons enriched with oxygen , @xmath304 , using a threshold of [ o / h]=@xmath305 .",

    "interestingly , the @xmath304 distribution for the nw simulation ( not shown ) looks nearly identical to the vzw model above @xmath119 k , indicating that enrichment mechanisms other than outflows ( e.g. dynamical stripping , delayed feedback ) are getting hot baryons , i.e. hot halo and whim gas , above this threshold metallicity . in the igm outside of haloes ,",
    "most particles remain pristine , as the typical fractions of enriched particles are @xmath306 . in photo - ionised gas within voids",
    ", the fraction of enriched particles can drop below @xmath307 .",
    "the lower left panel shows the average metallicity of only the enriched particles , [ o / h]@xmath308 .",
    "this demonstrates that much of the enriched portion of the diffuse igm has [ o / h]=@xmath309 .",
    "since the outflows carry out metals that are representative of the ejecting galaxy , this indicates that the dominant galaxies enriching the igm tend to have sub - solar metallicities ; these galaxies are generally well below @xmath221  ( as found in * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is a selection effect that highly enriched igm particles undergo stronger metal - line cooling , dropping them out of the warmer phases onto the photo - ionised locus .",
    "hence enriched particles in the underdense regions actually have higher metallicities than the whim gas in moderately overdense regions , since these are the only particles that can cool at such low densities .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath304 shows that such particles are quite rare .",
    "the lower right panel shows the log - normal dispersion , @xmath62([o / h]@xmath308 ) of the metals around the median log[[o / h]@xmath308 ] for the enriched particles only .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found that @xmath3 and @xmath2 enrichment at @xmath311 could be described by a log - normal distribution , but applied to all baryons .",
    "in general , regions with dispersions below 0.5@xmath62 are enriched via outflows consisting of ism gas having similar metallicities .",
    "the higher dispersions correspond to regions enriched via other mechanisms such as dynamical stripping and delayed feedback from intracluster stars .",
    "the association of @xmath25 with @xmath2 offers a potentially powerful way to explore metal inhomogeneity .",
    "we show alignment statistics of @xmath2 components with nearby @xmath25 components in figure [ fig : align_ovi ] .",
    "we plot the fraction of @xmath2 absorbers with an associated @xmath25 absorber at or below the velocity difference indicated on the @xmath156-axis , with the criteria that both absorbers have @xmath312 m  and @xmath233 . overlaid are stis data from @xcite using the same selection criterion .",
    "the data are unable to discriminate between vzw and vzw-0sig , but disfavour the vzw - z01 model , which tends to produce more alignment .",
    "od09 showed that @xmath2 absorbers trace similar diffuse densities and temperatures as @xmath25 , but that the @xmath2-traced enriched gas is inhomogeneous and clumpier than the diffuse baryons traced by the @xmath20 forest .",
    "the difference in metal inhomogeneity between the vzw and vzw-0sig models does not show up in the ewd and cdd distributions in figures [ fig : ew_ovi ] and [ fig : cdd_ovi ] , but the expected observational sample of the two most common species probed by cos is expected to provide the ability to statistically distinguish these two models .",
    "the cw model shows lower alignment owing to faster winds pushing metals further from the @xmath20 in both physical and velocity space .",
    "both turbulence and photo - ionisation - dependent cooling ( not shown ) do not alter the statistics from the vzw model .",
    "alignment statistics versus @xmath25 fundamentally probe the level of photo - ionisation in metal absorption , because @xmath25 arises almost exclusively in photo - ionised gas . models that produce more collisionally ionised @xmath2 will therefore have significantly less alignment with @xmath25 .",
    "current observations of @xmath2-@xmath25 alignment from @xcite shown in figure [ fig : align_ovi ] suggest that the vzw model produces roughly the correct level of photo - ionised gas in relation to @xmath25 , and therefore strongly favours our conjecture that much of the @xmath2 seen with cos is photo - ionised .",
    "our favoured model includes momentum - conserved winds and uses photo - ionisation - dependent cooling rates .",
    "the vzw - turb - pi model matches the @xmath2 statistics including the @xmath233 ewd , cdd , @xmath197 , and @xmath86-parameters when turbulent broadening is added as argued and theoretically motivated in od09 .",
    "we further advocate vzw winds for their ability to provide an adequate fit to the @xmath1 galactic stellar mass function below @xmath282 @xcite , from which most @xmath2 absorption arises ( od09 ) , as well as other properties of the low - redshift galaxy population  @xcite ; these galaxy properties are not expected to be greatly impacted by adding igm turbulence or pi cooling .",
    "the hm2001 ionisation background multiplied by 1.5 appears capable of both reproducing the observed @xmath20 forest ( d10 ) and @xmath2 that is principally photo - ionised .",
    "the vzw wind model also has successes fitting higher redshift data , including the @xmath19 mass - metallicity relationship @xcite , the @xmath313 galaxy luminosity function @xcite , and observations of igm metal enrichment at redshifts @xmath314 @xcite .",
    "the most obvious failing of the vzw model is its inability to quench star formation in @xmath315 galaxies and create the observed red sequence , although this likely has to do with our simulations lacking a mass - dependent quenching mechanism such as agn feedback @xcite .",
    "however , massive galaxies are not responsible for the vast majority of @xmath2 enrichment ( od09 ) , because they enrich a comparatively small volume of the universe , and so this quenching of massive galaxies is not expected to significantly impact our igm enrichment levels .",
    "nevertheless , this model also has significant problems that are shared by the other wind models we consider here . @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 observations pose a problem in that our favoured model produces too many absorbers compared to @xcite",
    ". it might be possible to alter the ionisation background at 3 - 4 rydbergs to mitigate this discrepancy while still satisfying the other observational constraints .",
    "updated ionisation backgrounds generated with the new version of cuba @xcite are worth exploring in the future .",
    "alternatively , our assumed yields could be too high , or carbon and silicon could be preferentially depleted onto dust @xcite . however",
    ", the discrepancy may result from limitations present in our simulations , namely that we fail to resolve cooling instabilities in halo gas where such lower - ionisation absorbers are expected to arise .",
    "quantifying @xmath33 and @xmath295 absorption may help distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "our favoured model also under - predicts the frequency of @xmath5 lines with column densities similar to those observed so far @xcite , which again may be a result of insufficient resolution within the halo gas , in the sense that we fail to resolve metal - bearing interfaces between cold clumps embedded in hot , tenuous halo gas .",
    "relatedly , od09 (  5.4 ) found a lower frequency of complex , collisionally ionised @xmath2 absorbers , which may also arise in shock interfaces within hot halo gas , as implied by some observations .",
    "in contrast , absorbers arising in more diffuse gas should be more robustly modelled in our simulations .",
    "hence , we are confident that , when probed to sufficiently low column densities , most high ionisation lines of @xmath2 and @xmath5 will mostly trace diffuse photo - ionised gas .",
    "since there have been a number of recent publications exploring @xmath2 and other metal - line statistics in cosmological simulations to @xmath1 , we now compare and contrast our results with these works .",
    "our discussion of alternative feedback methods begins with @xcite , who generate statistics for @xmath2 and @xmath3 from @xmath316 in a 50 @xmath82 @xmath317-cell uniform mesh simulation .",

    "their favoured wind efficiency is @xmath318 , where @xmath319 represents the fractional rest mass energy of all stars formed put into thermal feedback .",
    "their total wind energy is then @xmath320 erg/@xmath321 , which @xcite argue is roughly comparable to the total sne energy in a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) .    @xcite similarly use fixed - mesh eulerian simulations and parametrise star formation and feedback the same way . they can reproduce much of the observed @xmath322 @xmath2 cdd with a wind energy efficiency of @xmath323 .",
    "we calculate their total @xmath324 erg/@xmath321 , which is nearly twice the sne energy available in a chabrier imf if all stars @xmath325 explode as @xmath326 erg sne , but about equivalent if all stars @xmath327 explode as sne .",
    "@xcite advocate the need of distributing feedback over 27 cells ( as in @xcite ) to fit the observed star formation rate density history , whereas limiting the feedback to one cell makes it much less efficient at curtailing star formation .",
    "this means that in their case , metals are instantaneously distributed over a 99 to 294 @xmath222 cube depending on their simulations .    our simulations , in contrast ,",
    "attempt to directly mimic observations of galaxies that indicate wind speeds of hundreds of km / s emanating from galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and scaling with the circular velocity  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we are inevitably limited by resolution and numerics in that we can not fully resolve how winds escape from galaxies , so we are forced to employ parametrisations for these winds . the adopted parametrisations ( including hydrodynamic decoupling )",
    "are intended to represent observed winds at the scales at which they are observed .",
    "it is interesting that our winds typically travel @xmath142 physical kpc @xcite , which is similar to the scales over which @xcite and @xcite assume outflows distribute gas .",
    "the difference is that some of our winds can travel much farther or not as far , depending on the self - consistently tracked interaction between the gas and the ambient medium ; we do not directly parametrise how far winds and metals travel .",
    "moreover , in these fixed mesh simulations the distance metals travel is explicitly governed by the spatial resolution , while in our case the wind speeds are based on the galaxy mass , which is a well - converged quantity .",
    "for instance , the lower - resolution mesh simulations of @xcite produce a significant @xmath2 signal without any mechanism for distributing gas to nearby cells , in contrast to our no - wind case that produces essentially no igm metal absorbers .",
    "the direct sensitivity of fixed mesh simulations to ad hoc numerical parameters makes it difficult to interpret their conclusions about the physics driving igm enrichment . adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations could potentially provide a less resolution - sensitive implementation of winds .    finally , we point out that our feedback model has quite modest energy requirements relative to the above mesh simulations .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite strain the limits of available supernova energy .",

    "for instance , a @xmath334 galaxy has @xmath335 at @xmath147 and 0.21 at @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xcite in their  5.4 misinterpret the vzw model as requiring more energy than in the sn energy budget ; this is true only for central galaxies in haloes more massive than @xmath336 at @xmath147 , or for between 2 - 4% of all wind particles launched at any redshift .",
    "these galaxies are not responsible for enriching the igm , and in any case should not have significant ongoing star formation today  @xcite .",
    "absent in our simulations is any attempt to simulate the mixing of metals . for the purposes of cooling and generating mock spectra",
    ", we use particle metallicities , which is in contrast to @xcite , who smooth metallicities over sph particle smoothing lengths when calculating metal - line cooling .",
    "their metal smoothing was introduced in @xcite , who calculate that smoothed metallicities are @xmath337th the individual particle metallicities when all surrounding particles in their kernel are pristine . given that our metal - enriched igm wind particles",
    "are often surrounded by pristine gas , the cooling times of our metals could be as much as @xmath338 times shorter using our individual particle metallicities if metal - line cooling dominates total cooling .",
    "we suggest this could be the source of the greatest differences with the results of @xcite , who find the majority of @xmath2 above @xmath119 k. our cw - pi model is most similar to their `` reference '' model with notable other differences including a slightly higher wind speed ( @xmath339 vs. @xmath340 ) and that we decouple our winds ; both of these should make it easier for winds to escape galaxies in our simulations .",
    "nonetheless , both simulations have similar @xmath197 and similar overdensities bearing @xmath2 gas , but most of our @xmath2 gas resides around @xmath281 k , whereas theirs is at @xmath341 k with significantly more @xmath2 at temperatures @xmath342 k.    fixed mesh simulations with distributed feedback also can lead to much smoother metallicities , resulting in longer cooling times and hotter metal - bearing gas .",
    "we argue that the lack of metal smoothing is a fundamental difference causing a significant photo - ionised component of @xmath2 in our simulations versus others @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite make a strong case that using cie metal - line cooling rates over - estimates cooling resulting in too much photo - ionised @xmath2 in od09 .",
    "this is no doubt true , especially given the fact that in our cw simulations , photo - ionised metal - line cooling rates reduce @xmath197 by a factor of three .",
    "but as we demonstrated in  [ sec : zcool ] , for our favoured vzw case the difference is much less .",

    "treatments of metal diffusion have been implemented into other simulations @xcite , but it remains unclear to what extent metals mix in the igm .",
    "interpreting observations of metal absorbers at higher redshift suggest that metals could remain in concentrated , small cloudlets with metallicities similar to galactic ism gas @xcite .",
    "this scenario would favour our lack of mixing and the fact that winds carry ism gas directly into haloes and the igm . in summary ,",
    "the necessity and specific implementation of metal mixing remains uncertain when considering the low-@xmath87 igm .",
    "it appears that metal mixing is as determinative as implementations of metal - line cooling or feedback for interpreting igm metal - line observations .",
    "we examine the absorption and physical conditions of metals residing in the @xmath16290% of baryons outside of galaxies between @xmath1 and @xmath343 .",
    "we employ @xmath65 , @xmath344-particle cosmological simulations , the same simulations used by @xcite to explore the @xmath1 galactic stellar mass function and by @xcite to explore the @xmath20 forest .",
    "our work builds on the previous results of @xcite , finding fundamentally the same conclusions for @xmath2 , and also makes predictions for @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 specifically tailored to the expected instrumental characteristics of the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) .",
    "we subdivide the gas phases between the true igm ( @xmath345 at @xmath1 ) and gas within dark matter haloes ( @xmath346 at @xmath1 ) , and between hot ( @xmath347 k , whim and hot halo ) and cool ( @xmath6 k , diffuse and condensed ) phases .",
    "metal - line absorption is fundamentally different than its primordial big brother , the @xmath20 forest , owing to its much greater sensitivity to the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "while galactic outflows suppress star formation and therefore metal production , they concurrently distribute metals into haloes and the igm .",
    "our simulation without winds ( nw ) produces 2.1 times more metals by @xmath1 than the momentum - conserved wind ( vzw ) model , but the vzw simulation has 3.5 times more gaseous metals outside of galaxies , and _ 380 times more metals in the diffuse igm phase _ from which most igm metal absorbers arise .",
    "the resulting enrichment patterns are quite sensitive to the details of the enriching outflows .",
    "the combination of wind velocities and environment determines to how low a density the winds reach , e.g. , whether or not metals leave their dark matter haloes .",
    "low velocities from dwarf galaxies easily reach the igm , while @xmath138 winds from @xmath348 galaxies often fail to escape their haloes because of the greater ambient density of the surrounding gas @xcite .",
    "the wind velocity also determines the temperature to which the gas shock heats as the wind decelerates .",
    "fast winds that shock gas to @xmath349 k are more likely to join the whim or hot halo gas .",
    "the density and temperature where the metals are deposited in turn impacts their cooling rate , which can return enriched gas to photo - ionisation temperatures .",
    "tracking all these processes dynamically within growing large - scale structure presents a complex and challenging problem that impacts our understanding of a wide range of phenomena related to the cosmic evolution of baryons .",
    "our main results are as follows : + @xmath21 metals progressively are found in more overdense regions from @xmath38 . by @xmath1 in our favoured momentum - conserved wind ( vzw ) model ,",
    "only 4% of metals are outside of haloes ( i.e. at densities below the threshold defined by equation [ eqn : deltath ] ) , compared with @xmath350 at @xmath19 . the constant wind ( cw ) model has many more metals outside of haloes , but they mostly reside in the difficult - to - detect whim phase .",
    "the majority of metals today reside within galaxies , in contrast to the bulk of baryons that reside outside of haloes (  3 ) .",
    "@xmath21 for all the wind models , the mean metallicity of most of the baryonic phases is very slowly rising since @xmath351 .",
    "the exception is the condensed phase , which shows a more rapid rise as winds progressively enrich halo gas closer to galaxies at later epochs . by @xmath1 , the igm metallicities in both the cool ( diffuse ) and the hot ( whim ) phases are @xmath8 in the vzw model , and @xmath17 in the 90% of baryons outside galaxies (  3 ) .",
    "@xmath21 the igm is enriched in an `` outside - in '' fashion where lower overdensities are enriched at higher redshift .",
    "higher ionisation metal species generally trace older metals at lower overdensities owing to these species being primarily photo - ionised .",
    "the @xmath352 relation for vzw outflows results in a continuously rising metallicity - overdensity gradient and a gradual age - overdensity anti - correlation , which contrasts with the constant wind simulations (  3.3 ) .",
    "@xmath21 constant ( cw ) , momentum - conserved ( vzw ) , and slow ( sw ) wind models all predict @xmath233 @xmath2 observational statistics ( equivalent width distributions , column density distribution , cosmic ion densities ) that agree within a factor of two with observations by stis and fuse .",
    "by contrast , the no - wind model produces an @xmath2 incidence 100 times lower than the other feedback models and observations , which strongly emphasises the need for galactic superwinds to enrich the igm to the observed levels .",
    "all wind models over - produce the @xmath3 and @xmath4 incidence relative to available observations (  4 ) .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 absorbers predominantly ( by number ) arise in photo - ionised , cool gas .",
    "photo - ionisation results in higher ionisation lines tracing lower gas densities : @xmath4 and @xmath3 arise primarily from halo gas at @xmath233 , while @xmath2 arises mainly in the diffuse igm (  4,5.1 ) .",
    "we predict a population of @xmath5 absorbers with @xmath353 tracing photo - ionised diffuse @xmath6 k gas at overdensities of @xmath145 .",
    "stronger @xmath5 absorbers ( like stronger @xmath2 systems ) are more likely to be associated with @xmath354 k gas and may share more in common with the absorbers already detected (  4,5.1 ) .",
    "these results do not change when using metal - line cooling rates including the presence of a photo - ionising background (  6.2,6.3 ) .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath13 and @xmath14 absorbers are very rare , with frequencies of @xmath355 for cos s / n=30 spectra in all of our models .",
    "these absorbers likely trace halo gas at @xmath356 k (  4,5.1 ) .",
    "these species and @xmath5 all have a significant photo - ionised component , which is consistent with the shape of the @xcite ionisation background ; however @xmath13 and @xmath14 are too weak in this state to be detected using cos (  5.1.1 ) .",
    "no uv tracer we examine consistently and predominantly traces whim gas , i.e. shock - heated gas outside of galaxy haloes .",
    "@xmath21 using metal - line cooling rates accounting for photo - ionisation by the ionisation background @xcite reduces the incidence of @xmath2 absorbers at all column densities by one - third in the vzw model , which still provides an acceptable match with the observations .",
    "the difference is more dramatic for cw winds since it pushes metals to lower overdensities ; @xmath2 statistics are reduced by two - thirds and arise from gas closer to @xmath357 k. @xcite and @xcite correctly argue that assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium for metal cooling rates ( with no photo - ionisation ) leads to over - efficient metal - line cooling ; however we find that the moderate vzw winds leave metals at higher overdensities where metal - line cooling is still efficient even in the presence of photo - ionisation and results in most of the @xmath2 absorbers tracing @xmath358 k gas (  6.2 ) .",
    "@xmath21 we reiterate the result of od09 that heuristic turbulent broadening is required to reproduce the observed @xmath2 linewidths , but we suggest that this prescription may not be applicable to @xmath3 and @xmath4 primarily arising from haloes .",
    "@xmath2 arises from longer columns with potentially many cloudlets with random / turbulent velocities at sub - particle scales , while lower ionisation species are more likely to trace individual higher density cloudlets (  6.3 ) .",
    "@xmath21 absorber alignment statistics of @xmath25 with @xmath2 provide an independent constraint on the level of metal inhomogeneity in the igm , which we quantify in  6.4 .",
    "we disfavour a uniform metallicity of @xmath359 from comparisons with existing data , and future cos observations can potentially quantify the fraction of enriched gas and the dispersion of metals in the igm (  6.5 ) .",
    "@xmath21 the metal - line statistics to be probed by cos rarely vary by a factor of more than two between the different feedback models , despite enrichment patterns varying by much greater factors ( e.g. , 6.4 times more metals in the @xmath1 whim of cw vs. vzw ) . the relatively restricted density - temperature phase space traced by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5",
    "are enriched similarly in all wind models relative to the total distribution of metals outside galaxies (  3.2,5.1.2 ) .",
    "@xmath21 the observed cosmic ion density @xmath155 summed from absorbers typically underestimates the total @xmath155 of an ion .",
    "the stochastic effects of high overdensities being probed rarely in a volume - averaged measurement plus a large fraction of an ion s cosmic density being contained in saturated lines make accurate determinations of @xmath28 and @xmath254 more difficult .",
    "we estimate recovery fractions of 56 - 69% for @xmath197 and 30 - 39% for @xmath200 in s / n=30 cos observations .",
    "these fractions may be sensitive to the quality of the spectra and the fitting method used to estimate the column densities (  5.2 ) .",
    "@xmath21 exploring alternative ionisation backgrounds given the observed range of quasar emission slopes beyond the lyman limit , we find that the slope of the @xmath2 column density distribution becomes shallower using a harder background .",
    "the ionisation background strength varies by a factor of 16 at the @xmath2 photo - ionisation edge ( 8.4 rydberg ) , but even for the weakest field @xmath2 remains primarily photo - ionised .",
    "slopes of @xmath263 and harder predict more photo - ionised @xmath2 arising from halo gas (  6.1 ) . + while metal lines observed by cos are more sensitive to the processes regulating galaxy evolution , they are also more uncertain in their modelling and interpretation compared to the @xmath20 forest .",
    "our parameter exploration finds good fits to existing @xmath2 statistics , but appears to over - produce @xmath3 and possibly under - produce @xmath5 arising in hot haloes . like od09 ,",
    "we favour a momentum - conserved wind model with turbulent broadening , although we note that metal - line cooling in the presence of the photo - ionising background reduces @xmath2 by a third and makes the average absorber hotter ( 30,000 vs. 15,000 k ) ; however our @xmath2 results are still consistent with the current data .",
    "we further advocate this model for its ability to reproduce the galactic stellar mass function below @xmath360 @xcite , which are the same galaxies that are primarily responsible for igm enrichment ( od09 ) .",
    "we double down on our prediction of a primarily photo - ionised origin for most uv absorbers ( od09 ) , but realise the risky nature of our gamble .",
    "our model variations show just how sensitive metal - line statistics are to the shape of the ionisation background at poorly constrained energies , the stiff behaviour of metal - line cooling , and a turbulence model that is surely over - simplified .",
    "how metals mix in haloes and the igm is perhaps the most under - appreciated uncertainty for simulating such observations .",
    "our scheme of launching ism gas with no mixing may be the largest difference with other works with smoother metallicities leading to hotter temperatures @xcite ; however , there is observational evidence and theoretical motivation that small , highly - enriched cloudlets remain un - mixed in the igm @xcite .",
    "the other numerical uncertainty is the accuracy of the basic gadget-2  method of implementing galactic winds by one - at - a - time particle ejection , also used in many other sph codes .",
    "we have considered several variations of the scaling of outflow rate and ejection speed with galaxy mass , but we have not altered this basic scheme .",
    "the work presented here represents a broad brush approach to simulating metal line absorbers along random sight lines sampling the volume - weighted universe . with cos ,",
    "new statistics can be generated including correlation functions and line of sight variance statistics , probing the stochasticity of various ion species and perhaps the phase of gas that they trace .",
    "relating the distribution of metal absorbers to the surrounding large - scale structure , particularly the low - mass galaxies responsible for enriching the igm , will provide independent constraints on the nature of outflows .",
    "studying the galaxy - absorber connection uniquely links the physics regulating the growth of galaxies to the dominant reservoir of primordial and enriched baryons in the igm , which we will explore in the next paper in this series .",
    "we expect confronting the galaxy - absorber connection in particular with these and future simulations will provide unique tests that can both better distinguish wind models from each other , and push the limits of our scheme .",
    "our claim that photo - ionisation can explain the majority of the high ion species explored here will face a significant test as we focus on the circumgalactic environment within several hundred kpc of galaxies . given that interface physics and chemistry is not resolved in our simulation while it appears fundamental for absorption in galactic high - velocity clouds , suggests we are underestimating this phase of metal - absorbing gas .",
    "conversely , this phase may represent a small minority of the universal quantity of diffuse metal - enriched absorbing gas , which is the view we advocate here .",

    "<S> we investigate the metallicity evolution and metal content of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and galactic halo gas from @xmath0 using 110-million particle cosmological hydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the detectability and physical properties of uv resonance metal - line absorbers observable with _ </S>",
    "<S> hubble s _ cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that galactic superwind outflows are required to enrich the igm to observed levels down to @xmath1 using three wind prescriptions contrasted to a no - wind simulation . </S>",
    "<S> our favoured momentum - conserved wind prescription deposits metals closer to galaxies owing to its moderate energy input , while the more energetic constant wind model enriches the warm - hot igm ( whim ) 6.4 times more . despite these significant differences , </S>",
    "<S> all wind models produce metal - line statistics within a factor of two of existing observations . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 absorbers primarily arise from @xmath6 k , photo - ionised gas that is enriched to similar levels in the three feedback schemes . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 absorbers trace the diffuse phase with @xmath7 , which is enriched to @xmath8 at @xmath1 , although the absorbers themselves usually exceed @xmath9 and arise from inhomogeneously distributed , un - mixed winds . </S>",
    "<S> turbulent broadening is required to match the observed equivalent width and column density statistics for @xmath2 . @xmath3 and @xmath4 absorbers trace primarily @xmath10 k gas inside haloes ( @xmath11 ) , although there appear to be too many @xmath3 absorbers relative to observations . </S>",
    "<S> we predict cos will observe a population of @xmath5 photo - ionised absorbers tracing @xmath6 k , @xmath12 gas with equivalent widths of 10 - 20 m . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are rarely detected in cos s / n=30 simulated sight lines ( @xmath15 ) , although simulated @xmath14 detections trace halo gas at @xmath16  k. in general , the igm is enriched in an outside - in manner , where wind - blown metals released at higher redshift reach lower overdensities , resulting in higher ionisation species tracing lower - density , older metals . at @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the 90% of baryons outside of galaxies are enriched to @xmath17 , but the 65% of unbound baryons in the igm have @xmath18 and contain only 4% of all metals , a large decline from 20% at @xmath19 , because metals from early winds often re - accrete onto galaxies while later winds are less likely to escape their haloes . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that our results are sensitive to how metal mixing is treated in the simulations , and argue that the lack of mixing in our scheme may be the largest difference with other similar publications .    </S>",
