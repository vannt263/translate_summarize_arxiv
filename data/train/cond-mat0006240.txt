    "the properties of nematic liquid crystals in confined geometries continues to be an interesting problem for both basic science and technological reasons @xcite .",
    "nematics confined to cylindrical cavities with homeotropic radial boundary conditions can exhibit a variety of nontrivial structures depending on the competition between bulk elastic and surface energies . by minimizing the frank elastic free energy cladis and",
    "kleman @xcite and meyer @xcite showed that for a cylinder with a sufficiently large radius an escaped radial ( er ) configuration will form .",
    "this configuration can be thought of as a planar radial ( pr ) structure ( i.e. a disclination line ) which has `` escaped '' along the axis of the cylinder ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "later studies @xcite showed the possibility of additional structures including planar polar ( pp ) and planar polar with two line defects ( ppld ) . in these latter configurations",
    "the director lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder with a strong component along a single in - plane direction ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . in the pp structure",
    "the local director is uniform near the axis of the cylinder and radial at the boundary . in the ppld structure",
    "there are two half - integer disclination lines parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "kralj and zumer @xcite carried out a very complete numerical stability analysis of the various nematic structures in a cylindrical geometry by minimizing the frank elastic energy ( including the saddle - splay elastic constant @xmath3 ) .",
    "for most values of the elastic constants they found a phase diagram with er and pp structures , with the er structure stable for large radii and/or strong anchoring .",
    "in particular if the bend and splay elastic constants are equal and @xmath4 , then the er structure should form when @xmath5 exceeds about 27 @xcite , where @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 are the cylinder radius ( measured in units of intermolecular spacing ) , surface anchoring strength , and frank elastic constant respectively",
    ". however , a pr structure appears if the twist constant is very large compared with splay .",
    "they also found that the ppld structure can be stabilized if @xmath3 is nearly zero , r is approximately 100 , and the half - integer defect lines are separated by a distance approximately equal to the diameter of the cylinder .",
    "an analytic study of these director structures was carried out by burylov @xcite with similar results .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of a cylindrically confined nematic with radial homeotropic boundary conditions were first performed by chiccoli _",
    "_ @xcite using the lebwohl  lasher lattice model @xcite .",
    "this model represents each mesogenic molecule or small group of molecules by a three - dimensional spin vector .",
    "these spins are free to rotate about their centers which are fixed on the sites of a lattice",
    ". spins whose distance @xmath7 from the center of the cylinder is less than @xmath6 , the radius of the cylinder , interact with their nearest - neighbors through the usual bulk lebwohl - lasher pair potential :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the angle between two spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a second rank legendre polynomial and @xmath13 is a positive constant for nearest  neighbor sites and zero otherwise .",
    "the homeotropic surface anchoring is introduced via a group of boundary layer spins located at distances @xmath14 which point in a fixed radial direction .",
    "the interaction of these spins with the spins inside the cylinder is described by the potential :    @xmath15    where spin @xmath10 is located inside the cylinder and spin @xmath16 is the nearest ",
    "neighbor spin which belongs to the boundary layer .",
    "the coupling @xmath17 is the surface anchoring strength .",
    "the total potential energy is given by the sum of the two energies above , summed over all pairs of spins .",
    "note that in the lebwohl - lasher model , because the energy is invariant under a uniform rotation of all the spins , the bend , splay and twist elastic constants are equal , and the saddle splay elastic constant @xmath3 is identically zero .",
    "chiccoli _ et al .",
    "_  studied cylinders of radii 6 and 11 lattice spacings and heights 40 , 52 , 62 , and 82 lattice spacings with periodic boundary conditions along the cylinder axis .",
    "the spins were placed on the sites of a simple cubic lattice and the director structures were studied at a temperature of 0.6 , measured in units of @xmath13 .",
    "various values of the ratio of the surface anchoring strength @xmath17 to the bulk nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath13 were considered , the largest being unity . in all cases ,",
    "a planar structure was observed ; however , these authors did not determine whether this structure is pp or ppld .",
    "subsequently smondyrev and pelcovits @xcite carried out monte carlo simulations on much larger lebwohl  lasher systems up to radii @xmath18 , with a height of 16 , again using a simple cubic lattice .",
    "for low values of the radius or anchoring strength they found a ppld structure , whereas for @xmath19 , and a temperature of 0.9 , they obtained a metastable er configuration .",
    "but this metastable structure eventually collapsed to a planar state , apparently in contradiction with elastic theory which @xcite predicts that the er structure should be stable when @xmath5 exceeds approximately 27 .",
    "if we assume ( incorrectly , as we show in sec .  [ sec : extrapolation length ] ) that the ratio @xmath20 equals the corresponding frank elastic energy ratio @xmath21 , then smondyrev and pelcovits were simulating a system with @xmath22 , far in excess of the critical value of 27 .",
    "brada _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite carried out molecular dynamics simulations on cylindrically confined nematics interacting with a modified induced  dipole  induced  dipole interaction . for systems quenched from the isotropic phase to temperatures deep in the nematic phase",
    ", a phase diagram was obtained that is in reasonable agreement with the predictions of elastic theory . for the largest systems studied ( radii of 16 lattice spacings )",
    "the pp , ppld and er structures were observed with increasing values of the surface interaction . for the case of equal elastic constants (",
    "i.e. like the lebwohl  lasher model ) the er structure appears when the ratio of the surface to bulk interaction energies is 0.2 .",
    "however , these simulations were carried out for only 10000 time steps leaving open the possibility that the er structure ultimately collapses .",
    "also , these simulations were carried out at apparently lower temperatures than those used in the monte carlo simulations .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of mc simulations of the confined lebwohl  lasher model which address the question of why the er structure was not observed in previous mc simulations . we find that the ratio of the bulk  to  surface couplings in the lebwohl  lasher model , @xmath23 , is _ not _ equal to @xmath0 , except at very low temperatures .",
    "the latter quantity is equivalent @xcite to the surface extrapolation length @xmath24 .",
    "we find that there is significant dependence of @xmath24 on temperature in the lebwohl  lasher model ; in particular @xmath24 grows as the ni transition temperature is approached from below ( a feature observed in experimental studies of confined nematics @xcite ) .",
    "thus , identifying the parameter @xmath25 with @xmath26 is in general incorrect . except at very low temperatures",
    "@xmath5 will be less than @xmath25 ( substantially so near the ni transition ) .",
    "comparing the results of simulations with the predictions of elastic theory then requires consideration of this difference .",
    "we also find , for large enough systems , that the rate at which the system is cooled from the isotropic to the nematic phase determines which director structure is ultimately observed in a simulation . because @xmath24 is large near the ni transition , a slow cooling rate will first yield a ppld structure in this temperature range , in agreement with elastic theory which predicts that the ppld is stable for small values of @xmath27 .",
    "however , because of the large free energy barrier between the er and ppld structures , continued slow cooling to lower temperatures ( where @xmath24 is small and elastic theory predicts the appearance of the er structure for sufficiently large @xmath6 ) will not yield the expected er structure ; the system becomes trapped in the metastable ppld state . on the other hand , a relatively rapid cooling from the isotropic phase to low temperatures bypasses the ppld state and allows the er structure to form . to our knowledge , this is the first time a stable er structure has been seen in a mc simulation of confined nematics .",

    "[ sec : extrapolation length ] we describe our measurements of the surface extrapolation length and its temperature dependence . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] we report on simulations of a cylindrically confined nematic , exploring the effect of different cooling rates on the formation of the er and ppld structures .",
    "we offer some concluding remarks in the final section .",
    "to measure the temperature dependence of the surface extrapolation length @xmath24 , we consider a modification of the discussion presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this length is defined by examining the director profile in a nematic confined between two plates which impose a twist distortion that is uniform across the sample except near the plates .",
    "the twist geometry is appropriate for studying planar anchoring at a surface .",
    "as we are interested in homeotropic alignment we consider instead a splay geometry . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the extrapolation length can be defined by extrapolating the constant slope portion of the director profile corresponding to the uniform twist or splay distortion ; see fig .",
    "[ extrap ] . by minimizing the total elastic energy consisting of the bulk frank energy in the one  elastic constant approximation and the surface energy , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the length @xmath24 so defined is related to the frank elastic constant @xmath1 and the surface energy @xmath2 by @xmath28 .",
    "we measured @xmath24 defined in the above fashion in the lebwohl  lasher model on a cubic lattice of linear size 40 . on the plane @xmath29 we introduced the homeotropic surface interaction , eq .",
    "( [ surfenergy ] ) , with boundary spins aligned along the @xmath30 axis .",
    "spins on the opposite wall , @xmath31 , were rigidly aligned parallel to the @xmath32 axis .",
    "these spins interact with their interior neighbors via the bulk interaction , eq .  ( [ bulkenergy ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were imposed on the remaining four sides of the lattice .",
    "starting in the isotropic phase the system was cooled down in temperature steps of 0.05 .",
    "we equilibrated at least @xmath33 mc steps at each value of the temperature .",
    "we display results in fig .",
    "[ extrap ] for three values of temperature ranging from deep in the nematic phase to near the ni transition . for each value of @xmath30",
    "we plot the average value of the spin s angle with the @xmath30 axis ( averaging over all sites in the @xmath34 plane ) .",
    "we note that @xmath24 appears to diverge near the ni transition temperature in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "additional data for @xmath24 as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath17 is shown in table [ table ] . as expected",
    ", @xmath24 increases with decreasing surface coupling .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath24 on temperature indicates that @xmath2 , the surface energy , has a different dependence on temperature than the frank elastic constant @xmath1 .",
    "the latter was measured in the lebwohl  lasher model by cleaver and allen @xcite , who found it to be approximately proportional to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the nematic order parameter .",
    "experimental measurements of @xmath24 @xcite find that it diverges as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the ni transition temperature , which suggests that @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "our data is not sufficiently robust to determine the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath37 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath24 helps to explain the apparent discrepancy between the results of previous simulations @xcite and elastic theory @xcite , summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] . even at a relatively low temperature @xmath41 as was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath24 is of order 2 , and thus the elastic theory parameter @xmath42 that determines the relative stability of the various director structures is approximately half the value of the corresponding lebwohl  lasher `` bare '' parameter , @xmath43 . ref .",
    "@xcite reported on simulations carried out at @xmath44 with @xmath45 , where the lebwohl  lasher parameter is approximately 6 times greater than @xmath5 .",
    "thus the simulations carried out in this latter work at a value of @xmath18 , in reality correspond to @xmath46 , i.e. , approximately the threshold value for the formation of the er structure .",
    "on the other hand , the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite were carried out deep in the nematic phase where @xmath5 and @xmath43 are nearly equal .",
    "with the insight gained in the previous section regarding the proper comparison of simulation results with elastic theory , we carried out additional mc simulations on the lebwohl  lasher model confined to a cylinder .",
    "previous simulation studies of nematics confined to cylinders @xcite were done on a cubic lattice .",
    "however , this choice of lattice biases the position of the two disclination lines in the ppld structure ; in particular they always appear on one of the two crystalline axes perpendicular to the long axis of the cylinder . in addition approximately half of the spins on the perimeter of the cylinder",
    "have _ two _ nearest  neighbor spins on the fixed boundary layer ( see eq . ( [ surfenergy ] ) ) , whereas the other half have only one such nearest  neighbor , resulting in a nonuniform coupling of the nematic to the cylindrical surface .    to eliminate this nonuniformity we worked instead with a honeycomb lattice .",
    "with this choice nearly all spins on the perimeter of the cylinder have only one nearest  neighbor in the boundary layer . while the honeycomb lattice does not have continuous rotational symmetry about the cylinder axis , we found that its higher symmetry about this axis ( six  fold as compared to four  fold for the cubic lattice ) led to the appearance of the disclination lines in the ppld structure on axes not necessarily along the crystal lattice directions .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is bipartite allowing us to implement a standard `` checkerboard '' algorithm @xcite , an efficient choice for vector processors .",
    "we divided the system into two interconnected sublattices and then alternately updated spins on each .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite we determined the nature of the resulting director structures by computing an escaped order parameter , which measures the degree of spin tilt away from the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis , and is a sensitive measure of the presence of the er structure",
    ". it is given by : @xmath47 where the cylinder axis is along the @xmath30 direction .",
    "the escaped order parameter is calculated as a function of the distance from the center of the cylinder , and the sum is over spins in a thin annulus with the same height as the cylinder .",
    "we explored the stability of the ppld and er structures for systems of two different radii , 80 and 120 , both of height 16 , with @xmath48 . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we tabulate the values of @xmath27 for these two radii using the data for @xmath24 from table [ table ] . using the table",
    "we see that elastic theory predicts that the ppld structure should be stable for temperatures greater than 0.6 and 0.8 , for @xmath49 and 120 , respectively , while the er structure should be stable at temperatures below these values .",
    "note that elastic theory by its nature is unable to predict the transition temperature separating the ppld and er structures from the isotropic phase .",
    "beginning in the isotropic phase at @xmath50 we cooled the system of @xmath49 , in temperature steps of 0.1 equilibrating @xmath51 mc steps at each temperature . at @xmath44",
    "a stable ppld structure was formed .",
    "we checked the stability of this structure up to 500000 mc steps . upon further cooling down to @xmath52 ( again equilibrating 100000 mc steps at each temperature )",
    "the system remained trapped in the ppld structure even though at this lower temperature @xmath53 and @xmath54 , well above the threshold predicted by elastic theory for the formation of the er structure .",
    "we found similar behavior irrespective of the cooling rate used , including instantaneous quenches directly from the isotropic phase .",
    "conversely , if we began at @xmath55 with an er configuration constructed by hand using the mathematical form derived in refs .",
    "@xcite , we found this state to be stable even after 500000 mc steps .",
    "yet for this value of @xmath35 the ppld state should be stable ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "these results suggest that there is a large free energy barrier separating the ppld and er structures , and the system can be trapped in either state .",
    "we found somewhat different results for the larger radius system , @xmath57 .",
    "we cooled this system down from @xmath50 again in temperature steps of 0.1 equilibrating 300000 mc steps at each value of temperature . as expected a stable ( up to 500000 mc steps ) ppld structure",
    "was formed at @xmath44 ( @xmath58 ) . upon further cooling",
    "the system remained trapped in the ppld state , just as in the case of the smaller system .",
    "however , if the same system were equilibrated @xmath51 mc steps at each temperature step as it was cooled from @xmath50 to @xmath55 , then an er structure was formed at the latter temperature and remained stable up to 500000 mc steps . in this case the more rapid rate of cooling allowed us to bypass the incipient ppld structure at @xmath44 and reach the er structure which should be , according to elastic theory , the globally stable one at @xmath55 ( where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ) .",
    "we suspect that our ability to form an er structure for this system of larger radius is due to the smaller temperature range ( @xmath61 ) where the ppld structure is stable compared with the case of @xmath49 , where the ppld structure , according to elastic theory and table [ table2 ] , should be stable from @xmath62 down to @xmath63 .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the question of reconciling the predictions of elastic theory with the results of numerical simulations for nematics confined to cylindrical cavities with homeotropic boundary conditions .",
    "our main result is that care must be taken in comparing elastic theory with numerical simulations because of the strong temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath0 , the surface extrapolation length . except at very low temperatures ,",
    "this ratio is much _ larger _ than the corresponding `` bare '' ratio of bulk and surface energies in a numerically simulated model .",
    "when this difference is taken into account , the results of numerical simulations are consistent with the predictions of elastic theory .",
    "in particular , the er structure forms for values of @xmath5 above the critical value of 27 predicted by elastic theory , providing that the metastable ppld structure can be avoided . because @xmath0 is very large near the ni transition , and thus @xmath5 is relatively small , the system will readily form a ppld structure if it is cooled slowly from the isotropic phase .",
    "however , with rapid cooling and for large enough systems where the ppld phase is limited in its temperature range , this state can be bypassed and a stable er structure formed at lower temperatures where @xmath5 is sufficiently large .",
