    "in the theory of diffraction of sound , microwaves , or light , the radiation is assumed to propagate in uniform space with reflection by rigid objects or idealized boundaries . for a lucid introduction to the theory of diffraction",
    "we refer to sommerfeld s lecture notes @xcite .",
    "the early theory of diffraction was reviewed by bouwkamp @xcite .",
    "later developments are discussed by born and wolf @xcite .",
    "a brief review of the principles and applications of open - ended waveguides with idealized walls was presented by gardiol @xcite .",
    "the invention of the dielectric waveguide by hondros and debye @xcite has led to the development of optical fibers and the subsequent advances in telecommunication . in the theoretical determination of running wave solutions to maxwell s equations in a spatially inhomogeneous medium",
    "the radiation is assumed to propagate in a guiding structure of infinite length .",
    "the problem of emergence of radiation from a semi - infinite waveguide into a half - space is of obvious technical interest . in the case of sound",
    "the analysis is based on the exact solution of levine and schwinger @xcite,@xcite . for a dielectric waveguide the observation of the emerging radiation",
    "can be used as a tool to study the nature of the driving incident wave @xcite .",
    "it is advantageous to simplify the theoretical analysis by the use of planar symmetry .",
    "the theory of levine and schwinger was extended to planar geometry by heins @xcite . in the following we",
    "study radiation emerging from a semi - infinite planar dielectric waveguide . as an intermediate step the wavefunction in the exit plane must be calculated . in this case",
    "the integral equation technique of schwinger @xcite can not be implemented , because of the complicated nature of the integral kernel .",
    "we evaluate the emitted radiation and the coefficients of reflection back into the waveguide approximately in a first step of an iterative scheme .",
    "we show in two appendices that the iterative scheme converges to the exact solution in the related problems of reflection by a step potential in one - dimensional quantum mechanics and of fresnel reflection of an electromagnetic plane wave by a half - space . for the planar dielectric waveguide",
    "it does not seem practically possible to go beyond the first step of the iterative scheme .    in a numerical example we study a planar waveguide consisting of a slab of uniform",
    "dielectric constant , bounded on both sides by a medium with a smaller dielectric constant @xcite . in the case studied the first step of the iterative scheme leads to a modification of the wavefunction at the exit plane which is relatively small in comparison with the incident wave .",
    "hence we may expect that the calculation provides a reasonable approximation to the exact solution .",
    "we employ cartesian coordinates @xmath0 and consider a planar waveguide in the half - space @xmath1 with stratified dielectric constant @xmath2 and uniform magnetic permeability @xmath3 . in the half - space @xmath4",
    "the dielectric constant is uniform with value @xmath5 and the magnetic permeability is @xmath3 .",
