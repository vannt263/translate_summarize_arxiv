    "ubiquity of the normal distribution in nature is a consequence of its stability .",
    "however , stable distributions are not restricted to the gaussians : processes which involve discontinuous trajectories and algebraic tails @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a stability index , can be stable as well .",
    "divergent moments of those distributions reflect a presence of long jumps ( lvy flights ) .",
    "the normal distribution corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "the lvy stable statistics with @xmath6 is important when one considers realistic phenomena , where complexity , non - uniformity and long - range correlations play a role .",
    "for that reason , they are encountered and studied , for example , in biology @xcite , sociology @xcite and finance @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of many problems in those fields is a non - homogeneous structure of the medium which results in an anomalous transport , as it is the case for porous , disordered materials @xcite and folded polymers @xcite .",
    "the non - homogeneity of the medium has significant consequences for a stochastic description of such systems in terms of the langevin equation ; the noise can no longer be additive and must include a dependence on the process variable .",
    "despite that , multiplicative problems with lvy flights are rarely discussed in the literature .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the langevin equation with the multiplicative white noise is not unique and requires an additional interpretation of the stochastic integral .",
    "two of them are of particular interest : the it interpretation ( ii ) , for which the integrand is evaluated before the noise action , and the stratonovich one ( si ) which takes into account the process value both before and after the stochastic stimulation .",
    "si is distinguished since it constitutes a limit of the coloured noise in a form of the fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", ii applies for discrete systems and systems with a large inertia @xcite .",
    "ii leads to a fractional fokker - planck equation with a variable diffusion coefficient @xcite and it differs from that for si only by a spurious drift if @xmath5 . for non - gaussian processes a relation between both interpretations is more complicated and predictions qualitatively different : for si , in contrast to ii , slope of the distribution tail is modified by the multiplicative factor @xcite . in particular  in the case of the linear driving force  that factor may sufficiently weaken the noise to make the variance of the output signal finite .",
    "slopes corresponding to the finite inertia lie between values for ii and si @xcite which emphasises importance of taking into account both interpretations .",
    "one also can achieve the finite variance by introducing a nonlinear deterministic force to a system with the additive noise @xcite . from the physical point of view",
    ", the double - well potential is of particular interest since it allows us to study confined systems and , in particular , to model the barrier penetration .",
    "the double - well system was examined predominantly for the gaussian case @xcite ; then the first passage time problem resolves itself to a dynamical equation with ordinary boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the barrier penetration for the lvy flights was considered in ref .",
    "new effects emerge when one introduces ",
    "in addition to the double - well potential  a time - dependent periodic force .",
    "a rate of the jumping between the wells depends nonlinearly on the noise intensity and then a tuning of that intensity yields a matching of two characteristic frequencies : the noise - induced rate and a frequency of the deterministic , periodic force .",
    "that phenomenon , called a stochastic resonance @xcite , is well - known for the gaussian noise @xcite and was analysed also for the multiplicative case @xcite .",
    "if the additive noise involves the lvy flights the stochastic resonance also emerges ; it was observed in systems with both the double- @xcite and single - well potential @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address a problem of the resonant switching between potential wells for the case of the multiplicative lvy - stable stochastic stimulation .",
    "we demonstrate to what extend properties of the system are modified , in respect to the known cases , when one introduces long jumps and takes into account a dependence of the noise on position for both si and ii . in sec.ii the system , which includes the bistable potential and the oscillatory force , is defined and a mean first passage time calculated .",
    "existence of the stochastic resonance is demonstrated , and dependence of the signal amplitude on the system parameters discussed , in sec.iii .",
    "a general stable lvy distribution is expressed in terms of three parameters : the stability index @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , which determines the tail of the distribution , the asymmetry parameter ( skewness ) and the translation parameter . since ,",
    "in the following , we restrict our analysis to the symmetric distributions , the index @xmath2 completely determines the driving noise .",
    "the characteristic function for this case reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 measures the apparent width of the distribution . if @xmath5 eq.([lev ] ) represents the normal distribution , otherwise the tails are algebraic , @xmath10 , and the stochastic trajectory is discontinuous in a sense of the lindeberg condition @xcite .",
    "the variance is infinite , as well as all higher moments .",
    "we consider a motion in the time - dependent bistable potential @xmath11 where the amplitude @xmath12 and the frequency @xmath13 are constant .",
    "the system is driven by the noise @xmath14 and we assume that increments of the noise @xmath15 are distributed according to the characteristic function ( [ lev ] ) .",
    "then the langevin equation is of the form @xmath16 intensity of the noise algebraically depends on the position , @xmath17 where @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we take into account two interpretations of the multiplicative noise in eq.([la ] ) : the it interpretation and the stratonovich interpretation .",
    "components of the discretized stochastic integral in ii are defined by @xmath19[\\eta(t_i)-\\eta(t_{i-1})]$ ] , i.e. @xmath20 $ ] is calculated before the noise acts . in si , in turn , one takes a middle point : @xmath21[\\eta(t_i)-\\eta(t_{i-1})]$ ] .",
    "a difference between both interpretations , as well as probability density distributions for some nonlinear potentials , is well - known for the gaussian processes @xcite .",
    "the fokker - planck equation , corresponding to eq.([la ] ) in ii , involves a fractional derivative and a variable diffusion coefficient @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "a technical advantage of si consists in an admissibility of the variable change which allows us , in the one - dimensional case , to reduce eq.([la ] ) to the langevin equation with the additive noise .",
    "validity of the ordinary rules of the calculus was rigorously proved for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed for @xmath6 by the numerical simulations but the linear case required introduction of a cut - off to the distribution @xcite . on the other hand , rules of the ordinary calculus",

    "after the transformation @xmath24 the langevin equation takes the form @xmath25 where the effective potential reads @xmath26 wells of the time - independent part of the potential are positioned at @xmath27 and their depth declines with @xmath1 .",
    "properties of the stochastic system are different for both interpretations of eq.([la ] ) . the case @xmath28 was discussed in ref.@xcite . for ii , the distribution tail does not depend on @xmath1  it falls like @xmath29",

    "defined in terms of the reflection and/or absorbing barriers  is of particular interest for that system .",
    "an influence of the algebraic tails of the distribution for @xmath6 on the average transition time between the wells becomes visible if width of the barrier is sufficiently large ; then the transition may be caused by a single jump @xcite . otherwise the motion is dominated by a continuous superposition of many small jumps , similarly to the gaussian case , and the transition time depends exponentially on the potential depth according to the arrhenius formula .",
    "the mean first passage time displays a bell - shape as a function of @xmath2 : it rises with @xmath2 up to @xmath44 and then falls @xcite . in the case of the multiplicative noise , a behaviour of the transition time as a function of system parameters depends on the specific interpretation of the stochastic integral @xcite .    .",

    "the red solid lines are of the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 and 4.75.,width=415 ]    the multiplicative term @xmath55 qualitatively modifies the distribution .",
    "first , we consider the case without the absorbing barrier .",
    "the distribution possesses two peaks , at negative and positive @xmath56 , corresponding to the well positions .",
    "their height decreases with @xmath9 and , for @xmath57 , they vanish altogether .",
    "instead , a peak at the origin emerges as a result of increased contribution from the interwell motion .",
    "fig.1 presents the probability density distributions obtained by a numerical integration of eq.([la ] ) with the initial condition @xmath58 .",
    "a relatively large noise intensity has been applied and the interwell motion prevails .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath41 , the distribution is strongly anisotropic for both interpretations .",
    "since the noise vanishes at the origin for @xmath57 , the particle abides near the top of the barrier . on the other hand , for the case @xmath59 both peaks are present even for a large @xmath9 .",

    "the following values of @xmath2 are presented : 2 ( black squares ) , 1.8 ( blue circles ) , 1.5 ( green triangles ) and 1.2 ( red diamonds ) . lines with empty symbols corresponds to @xmath41 .",

    "averaging was performed over @xmath62 events.,width=718 ]    the mean passage time as a function of @xmath1 for various configurations is presented in fig.2 .",
    "results depend both on the stability index @xmath2 and on the particular interpretation of the stochastic integral . moreover , a sensitivity on the potential geometry is visible .",
    "first , let us consider the case of the relatively wide barrier ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "depth of the effective potential for si , eq.([potef ] ) , diminishes with @xmath1 and one could expect a smaller @xmath46 .",
    "however , we know from ref.@xcite that , for a system with the additive noise , @xmath46 depends rather on the width of the barrier than on the potential depth if jumps determine the barrier penetration . we observe a similar effect : position of the effective well reaches its minimum at @xmath63 which value corresponds to the minimum of @xmath46 in the figure .",
    "nevertheless , there is no qualitative difference between the cases @xmath42 and 2 .",
    "shape of the curves @xmath64 for ii is similar but @xmath46 rises faster for @xmath59 , as a result of a strong noise damping .",
    "the passage time as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath45 is different than for @xmath36 because then @xmath65 , @xmath66 does not exist and @xmath64 monotonically falls .",
    "since @xmath18 , such a behaviour is expected for all narrow barriers , namely if @xmath67 . obviously , @xmath46 in fig.2 decreases with @xmath2 because the noise intensity @xmath68 .",
    "the rate of jumping between potential wells due to the noise can match the frequency @xmath13 of the deterministic oscillatory force revealing a resonant pattern .",
    "this phenomenon has been extensively studied for the gaussian processes and observed also for the general lvy statistics of the noise .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref.@xcite that the signal - to - noise ratio exhibits a resonant amplification for many systems characterised by the long jumps . the spectral amplification and dynamic hysteresis loops were calculated for the asymmetric lvy noise with various @xmath2 and skewness parameter @xcite ; the amplification dwindles with decreasing @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the stochastic resonance phenomenon for a linear multiplicative gaussian noise was studied in ref.@xcite and attributed to the transition from an intrawell to an interwell modulated dynamics .     versus @xmath1 for si ( solid lines ) and ii ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the case @xmath36 was calculated with @xmath5 ( black squares ) and 1.5 ( green circles ) , the case @xmath45 with @xmath69 ( blue stars ) .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig.4 .",
    "right part : height of the peak versus @xmath1.,width=718 ]    a useful quantity to describe a stochastic resonance is a correlation between the output process @xmath70 and the periodic driving , @xmath71 .",
    "it equals the first fourier coefficient which follows from the expression @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 results from eq.([la ] ) .",
    "the density @xmath74 is asymptotically periodic and an averaging over the period produces a stationary distribution .",
    "the spectral amplification at the frequency @xmath13 is given by a ratio of the integrated power stored in spikes of the power spectrum to the total power carried by the oscillatory force , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) also can be expressed by @xmath77 : snr@xmath78 where @xmath79 is the total power spectral density . the latter quantity is directly related to the autocorrelation function and its existence requires the finite variance .",
    "that condition is satisfied for systems with the quartic potential in si since then the tail @xmath80 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", an analysis for both the free particle and the linear force indicates that in ii shape of the distribution tails does not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "fig.3 shows that also for the general system ( [ la ] ) the tails fall faster than for the simple lvy motion : the slope rises with @xmath1 for si whereas it does not depend on @xmath1 for ii .",
    "therefore variance remains finite when lvy flights are included and the spectral quantities , @xmath81 and snr , are finite and well determined .    for small amplitudes and large time ,",
    "a response of the system to the periodic stimulation is proportional to @xmath71 , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a phase lag @xcite .",
    "the stochastic resonance is usually detected by plotting @xmath71 as a function of the stochastic stimulation @xmath9 . that function does not monotonically diminish but exhibits a bell - shaped structure maximum of which corresponds to a matching condition of two frequencies : @xmath13 and a rate of the stochastic jumping , @xmath84 .",
    "then we can expect that a position of the resonance is directly related to the mean passage time and satisfies the approximate condition @xmath85 hight of the peak rises with the amplitude @xmath12 and diminishes with the frequency @xmath13 . in the following ,",
    "we discuss an emergence of the stochastic resonance in the system ( [ la ] ) and demonstrate how its position and intensity depends on @xmath2 , @xmath1 , as well as geometry of the potential .     and",
    "@xmath5 , 1.8 and 1.5.,width=718 ]    fig.4 presents results of the calculations : a dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath9 for two values of @xmath1 , both positive and negative ; comparison with the additive noise is included .",
    "the resonance structure is visible for all the presented cases .",
    "remarkable differences emerge when one compares both interpretations . for si",
    ", @xmath71 is large if @xmath57 and a position of the peak , @xmath86 , occurs at larger noise intensity than for @xmath59 since then the effective barrier is wider .",
    "the resonance for the positive @xmath1 emerges at roughly the same @xmath9 as for @xmath41 .",
    "the peak is much lower for ii if @xmath57 and corresponds to a smaller @xmath9 than for @xmath59 . the latter case , governed by eq.([fpi ] ) , is characterised by a weak noise intensity when the particle remains far from the origin and that effect must be compensated by a larger @xmath9 .",
    "dependence on @xmath2 is similar for both interpretations : @xmath86 shifts towards smaller @xmath9 and @xmath87 rises with @xmath2 for @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath86 falls with @xmath2 also for @xmath59 but this effect is much weaker , especially for ii .",
    "a dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath1 is presented in fig.5 for @xmath42 and 2 .",
    "the difference between both interpretations is especially pronounced for @xmath57 when @xmath86 remains constant for ii , in contrast to si . for @xmath59 ,",
    "all presented cases exhibit a monotonically increasing function @xmath88 .",
    "height of the resonance , @xmath89 , is also presented in fig.5 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this dependence is very weak for ii , in contrast to si for which we observe a pattern similar to @xmath88 with a minimum at the same point .",
    "results for both values of @xmath2 are almost the same .",
    "an apparent similarity between fig.2 and 5 , which is especially striking for si , is a consequence of the condition ( [ warres ] ) ; since the curves @xmath64 for different @xmath9 are , approximately , parallel to each other , they mimic the dependence @xmath88 .",
    "a change of the potential shape qualitatively modifies @xmath46 and one can expect differences also for the stochastic resonance .",
    "this conclusion is illustrated in fig.5 which compares the case of the wide barrier ( @xmath36 ) with the case of the narrow barrier ( @xmath45 ) for both interpretations . though results for ii do not differ substantially ",
    "@xmath86 rises for both geometries  the curve for si and @xmath45 is flat resembling a similar behaviour of @xmath46 , cf .",
    "comparison of the peak heights is also presented in fig.5 .",
    "we conclude that the amplitude is not sensitive not only to @xmath2 but also to the barrier width , in contrast to peaks position .",
    "the amplification is much stronger for si than for ii and the dependence @xmath90 is determined mainly by a specific interpretation of the stochastic integral .",
    "curves @xmath91 for the narrow barrier , shown in fig.6 , are similar to the case @xmath36 ( fig.4 ) ; difference resolves itself to a smaller @xmath86 for si if @xmath92 .",
    "properties of systems containing stochastic force , which is characterised by the stable distribution with the heavy tails , differ from those for the normal distribution possessing , in particular , the infinite variance .",
    "systems with the multiplicative noise exhibit a more complicated behaviour and the variance may be finite , despite the algebraic tails .",
    "nonlinear potentials , in turn , makes the distribution tails steeper and may invoke an effective trapping . in such systems motion",
    "is limited in space and asymptotics of the driving noise plays a relatively minor role , compared to the diffusion problems .",
    "motion in the double - well potential is a simple example .",
    "we have discussed such a system : the anharmonic oscillator with the periodic modulation and the stochastic stimulation in a form of the stable , multiplicative process .",
    "the multiplicative factor , assumed in the algebraic form , makes the distribution anisotropic ; the point @xmath93 becomes an attractor for @xmath57 since noise vanishes at the origin .",
    "the mean first passage time depends on a particular interpretation of the stochastic integral ; for si it is determined rather by the size of the effective potential than by the effective well depth .",
    "that conclusion , however , is valid only for a relatively wide barrier and then the geometry is important for the dependence @xmath64 .",
    "the passage time smoothly rises with @xmath2 for both geometries and no qualitative difference in respect to @xmath5 has been observed .    the system ( [ la ] )",
    "possesses two characteristic frequencies , @xmath13 and @xmath84 , and , when they match , the resonance occurs .",
    "the resonance shape of the dependence @xmath91 has been observed for all analysed cases . since the variance is finite also for processes with the lvy flights , both the spectral amplification @xmath81 and snr are well determined . for si ,",
    "height of the resonance is sensitive on @xmath1 and the amplification rapidly rises when @xmath1 becomes negative .",
    "position of the resonance , in turn , mimics the dependence @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , size of the barrier is important for the resonance position : @xmath86 is almost constant for si if @xmath45 , in contrast to the case @xmath36 .",
    "we finally conclude that  though height and position of the peaks depend on @xmath2  the bistable system with the lvy flights has similar properties as the case of the gaussian processes . on the other hand , dependence of the noise on the process value",
    "essentially modifies ",
    "differently for each interpretation of the stochastic integral  the distributions , the passage time and properties of the stochastic resonance ."
