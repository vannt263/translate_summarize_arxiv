    "the study of multiparticle production in hadron collisions at high energies is an outstanding problem in the study of the strong interactions . with the advent of qcd",
    ", it was understood that semi - hard particle production in high energy hadronic interactions is dominated by interactions between partons having a small fraction @xmath0 of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming nucleons . in the regge limit of small @xmath0 and",
    "fixed momentum transfer squared @xmath1  corresponding to very large center of mass energies squared @xmath2  the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation  @xcite predicts that parton densities grow very rapidly with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "because this rapid growth in the regge limit corresponds to very large phase space densities of partons in hadronic wave - functions , it was proposed that saturation effects may play an important role in hadronic collisions at very high energies  @xcite .",
    "saturation effects slow down the growth of parton densities relative to that of bfkl evolution and may provide the mechanism for the unitarization of cross - sections at high energies .",
    "the large phase space density suggests that the small @xmath0 partons can be described by a classical color field rather than as particles @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model proposes a dual description , whereby small @xmath0 partons are described by a classical field and the large @xmath0 partons act as color sources for the classical field . the original model considered a large nucleus containing a large number of large @xmath0 partons ( at least @xmath3 valence quarks where @xmath4 is the atomic number of the nucleus ) . in this limit",
    ", they produce a strong color source and one has to solve the full classical yang - mills equations to find the classical field .",
    "this procedure properly incorporates the recombination interactions that are responsible for gluon saturation . in the mv model , the large @xmath0 color sources",
    "are described by a gaussian statistical distribution  @xcite .",
    "a more general form of this statistical distribution , for @xmath5 gauge theories , valid for large @xmath4 and moderate @xmath0 , is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the separation between large @xmath0 and small @xmath0 , inherent to the dual description of the mv model , is somewhat arbitrary and has been exploited to derive a renormalization group ( rg ) equation , the jimwlk equation @xcite .",
    "this functional rg equation describes the change in the statistical distribution of color sources with @xmath0 .",
    "it can be expressed as an infinite hierarchy of evolution equations for correlators @xcite , and has a useful ( and tremendously simpler ) large @xmath6 and large @xmath4 mean - field approximation @xcite , known as the balitsky - kovchegov equation .",
    "this general framework is often referred to as the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "the discussion above refers to the properties of hadronic wave functions at high energies . to compute particle production in the cgc framework ,",
    "( a ) one must find the distribution of color sources in the projectiles , either by solving the jimwlk equation or by using a model such as the mv model , and ( b ) one must calculate the production of the relevant particles from the sources . in this paper , we will assume that the source distributions are known and shall focus on particle production in the presence of these sources .    at leading order",
    ", one knows how to compute the production of quarks and gluons from strong color sources .",
    "inclusive gluon production is obtained by solving the classical yang - mills equations for two color sources moving at the speed of light in opposite directions  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been solved numerically in @xcite for the boost - invariant case .",
    "a first computation for the boost non - invariant case has also been performed recently  @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity of quark - pairs is computed from the quark propagator in the background field of @xcite  it has been studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "these results summarize the state of the art in studies of particle production from strong classical color sources . in the present paper",
    ", we will systematically examine particle production in a field theory coupled to an external time - dependent classical source . in particular , we will consider how one computes results beyond the above mentioned leading order results . to avoid the technical complications of gauge theories",
    ", we shall focus our discussion on the theory of a real scalar field .",
    "the complexities of qcd , such as gauge invariance , are of course extremely important .",
    "however , several of the lessons gained from the simpler theory considered here should also apply to studies of particle production in qcd .",
    "these will be applied in follow ups to this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin , in the next section , by setting up the model .",
    "we recall well known results for counting powers of the coupling constant and of the powers of @xmath7 ; in particular we discuss how these are modified for field theories with strong external sources .",
    "we discuss the vacuum - vacuum diagrams that will play a crucial role in the rest of the paper .",
    "we show clearly that the sum of the vacuum - vacuum diagrams is not a trivial phase ( as is the case for field theories in the vacuum ) but gives a non - trivial contribution to the probability in theories where the field is coupled to a time - dependent source .    in section [ sec : distribution ] , we use cutkosky s cutting rules to derive a formula for the probability @xmath8 of producing @xmath9 particles , in terms of cut vacuum - vacuum diagrams .",
    "this formula , for theories with strong sources , is new and is valid to all orders in the coupling constant .",
    "while the formula at this stage is not useful for explicit computations , it shows unambiguously that the distribution of the multiplicities of produced particles is not poissonian , even in the classical approximation .",
    "we also derive a compact formula for the generating function @xmath10 of the probabilities @xmath8 .    in section [ sec : keldysh ]",
    ", we discuss in detail the calculation of the first moment of the distribution , namely , the average multiplicity @xmath11 .",
    "we obtain a formula which is valid to all orders for @xmath12 .",
    "we work it out explicitly at leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "it is well known that the leading order expression can be expressed in terms of classical fields that are computed by solving partial differential equations , with retarded boundary conditions , for the classical fields .",
    "what is remarkable and a major result of this work is the fact that one can similarly compute the multiplicity at nlo from the small fluctuation fields ( in the presence of the classical background field ) with simple initial conditions at @xmath13 , i.e. in terms of partial differential equations with retarded boundary conditions .",
    "_ this result makes next - to - leading order computations of the average multiplicity feasible even in theories with strong external sources .",
    "it has possibly very significant ramifications for heavy ion collisions .",
    "_    the results in section  [ sec : distribution ] and [ sec : keldysh ] are related in section [ sec : agk ] .",
    "the abramovsky - gribov - kancheli cancellations @xcite , originally formulated in the context of reggeon field theory models , play an important role in relating the inclusive particle multiplicities in [ sec : keldysh ] to moments of the probability distributions in [ sec : distribution ] . in section [ sec : agk ]",
    ", we provide a `` dictionary '' to map the original agk discussion formulated in the language of cut reggeons into our language of cut vacuum - vacuum diagrams in field theories with external sources . the fact that the agk cancellations require a poissonian distribution of cut reggeons is seen to follow naturally if one identifies reggeons ( cut and uncut ) with connected vacuum - vacuum sub - diagrams .",
    "this identification further leads us to the conclusion that there are further cancellations that are not visible when the discussion takes place at the level of reggeons .",
    "these additional cancellations simplify the calculation of the multiplicity @xmath12 as well as that of higher moments .",
    "we end this section by a general formula that gives the variance of the distribution of produced particles .    in the final section ,",
    "we provide a summary of the new results derived in this paper and of their possible ramifications for qcd at high energies .",
    "the paper contains four appendices . in appendix",
    "[ app : sk ] , we give a very brief reminder of the schwinger - keldysh formalism . in appendix",
    "[ app : ls ] , we derive the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation ( [ eq : ls ] ) . in appendix",
    "[ app : inv - agk ] , we discuss a proof demonstrating that the only distributions of cut reggeons that lead to agk cancellations are poisson distributions . in appendix  [ app : cancellations ] , we discuss details of the cancellations giving rise to the identity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : agk - rhs2 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will set the groundwork for the discussion in subsequent sections .",
    "much of the material here is textbook fare and can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "however , there are subtleties that distinguish the discussion of field theories in the presence of external sources to discussions of field theories in vacuum .",
    "these are emphasized throughout , especially in section  [ sec : vacuum ] .",
    "the model , for all the discussions in this paper , will be the theory of a real scalar field @xmath14 , with @xmath15 self - interactions and with the field coupled to an external source @xmath16 .",
    "this simple scalar theory captures many of the key features of multi - particle production in qcd , while avoiding the complications arising from keeping track of the internal color degrees of freedom and the necessity of choosing a gauge in the latter .    without further ado ,",
    "the lagrangian density in our model is @xmath17 the reader should note that the coupling @xmath18 in this theory is dimensionful , with dimensions of the mass ; the theory therefore , in 4 dimensions , is super renormalizable .",
    "when we draw the feynman diagrams for this theory , we will denote the source by a black dot . keeping in mind applications of our results to the description of hadronic collisions in the color glass condensate framework",
    ", one may think of @xmath16 as the scalar analog of the sum of two source terms @xmath19 corresponding respectively to the color currents of the two hadronic projectiles .",
    "power counting is essential in understanding the perturbative expansion of amplitudes in this model . for theories with weak sources , where @xmath20 is parametrically of order @xmath21",
    ", the leading contributions would come from the diagrams with the least number of vertices .",
    "we are here interested in theories ( such as the cgc ) where the sources are strong . by strong , we mean specifically that the @xmath22 term is of the same order as the other terms in the lagrangian density .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 is of order unity , as opposed to @xmath24 itself .",
    "therefore , as discussed further below , independent powers of @xmath18 in any given diagram arise only if the vertex is not connected to a source . in this power counting scheme",
    ", the leading diagrams can have negative powers of @xmath18 .",
    "we will subsequently also discuss the power counting in @xmath7 .      for strong sources , @xmath25 , attaching new sources to a given diagram does not change its order .",
    "there are therefore an infinity of diagrams contributing at a given order in @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , even the classical approximation of this model , which involves only tree diagrams , resums an infinite number of contributions .",
    "field theories coupled to a strong source are therefore non - trivial and exhibit rich properties _ even if the coupling @xmath18 is very small_.    to make this discussion more explicit , consider a generic simply connected diagram containing @xmath26 external lines , @xmath27 internal lines , @xmath28 loops , @xmath29 sources and @xmath30 vertices .",
    "these parameters are not independent , but are related by the equations , @xmath31 thanks to these two relations , the order of this diagram is @xmath32 as explained previously , when the source is as strong as @xmath33 , the last factor is irrelevant ; the order of the diagram depends only on its number of external legs and number of loops .",
    "note also that the above formulas are only valid for a simply connected diagram : they must be applied independently to each disconnected subdiagram of a more complicated diagram .",
    "note in particular that a simply connected tree diagram ( @xmath34 ) with no external legs ( @xmath35 ) attached to strong sources is of order @xmath36 .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss the order in @xmath7 of a given diagram .",
    "recall that @xmath7 has the dimension of an action .",
    "therefore , @xmath37\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the free propagator . from this equation , it is clear that the following mnemonic can be applied to keeping track of powers of @xmath7 in the perturbative expansion :    * a propagator brings a power of @xmath7 , * a vertex brings a power of @xmath39 , * a source @xmath20 brings a power of @xmath39 .",
    "the order in @xmath7 of the generic diagram in the previous sub - section is therefore @xmath40 we thus recover the well - known result that the order in @xmath7 , for a fixed number of external legs , depends only on the number of loops .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , it is important to note that the result does not depend on the number of insertions of the classical source in the diagram .",
    "clearly this implies that arbitrarily complicated diagrams can be of the same order in @xmath7 . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we do not keep track of the powers of @xmath7 , and simply set @xmath41 .      the forthcoming discussion in the next section , of the multiplicity distributions of produced particles ,",
    "will be formulated in terms of `` vacuum - vacuum '' diagrams in the presence of strong external sources .",
    "vacuum diagrams are simply feynman diagrams without any external legs  @xcite .",
    "they contribute to the vacuum - to - vacuum transition amplitude @xmath42  hence the name .",
    "the perturbative expansion of any amplitude with external legs generates these vacuum ",
    "vacuum diagrams as disconnected factors .",
    "when one considers a field theory in the vacuum ( no external source : @xmath43 ) , one usually disregards vacuum  vacuum graphs because their sum is a pure phase that does not contribute to transition probabilities . that the sum of vacuum - vacuum diagrams , in this case , is a pure phase follows from the fact that no particles can be created if the initial state is the vacuum .",
    "the probability that the vacuum stays the vacuum is unity and the corresponding amplitude must be a pure phase .",
    "the situation is very different in a theory , like the one under consideration , where the fields are coupled to an external source .",
    "assume that this external source is such ( time - dependent for instance ) that an amplitude from the vacuum to a populated state is non - zero , namely , @xmath44 from unitarity , @xmath45 we conclude that @xmath46 therefore , the amplitude @xmath42 can not be a pure phase .",

    "the number preceding each diagram is its symmetry factor .",
    "note finally that because external lines are absent , the power counting of the previous subsection tells us that vacuum - vacuum diagrams come with powers that are given by @xmath50 therefore , in the presence of strong sources , @xmath51 , connected tree vacuum - vacuum diagrams are all of order @xmath36 , the 1-loop vacuum - vacuum diagrams are all of order @xmath21 , and so on .",

    ", we will discuss a method for computing @xmath53 $ ] directly .",
    "we will begin this section with a discussion of the cutting rules for vacuum - vacuum graphs in theories with external sources . these rules , for instance ,",
    "can be employed to compute the imaginary part of the @xmath54 $ ] introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vconn ] ) .",
    "we will then present an intuitive discussion of how the probability for producing @xmath9-particles can be expressed in terms of cut vacuum - vacuum diagrams .",
    "we shall demonstrate the importance of the vacuum - vacuum factors in preserving unitarity for a theory with strong external sources .",
    "a generating function is introduced to compute moments of the distribution of probabilities ; we will show that the distribution of probabilities is non  poissonian , even for classical tree level graphs . in the final sub - section , we will present a formal expression of the intuitive arguments developed in the previous sub - sections .",
    "let us first consider the analog of the cutkosky rules @xcite in our model .",
    "these will also prove useful for our discussion in the following section where we develop an alternative method to compute multiplicity distributions .",
    "one starts by decomposing the feynman ( time - ordered ) free propagator in two pieces according to the time - ordering of the two endpoints @xmath55 this equation defines the propagators @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the notations for these objects have been chosen in analogy with the schwinger - keldysh formalism ( see @xcite , and the brief summary in appendix [ app : sk ] ) , for reasons that will become clear in section [ sec : keldysh ] . pursuing this analogy , the feynman propagator @xmath58 is also denoted as @xmath59 .",
    "we introduce as well the ( anti  time - ordered ) propagator @xmath60 defined as @xmath61 note that the four propagators so defined are not independent ; they are related by the identity , @xmath62 in addition to these new propagators , we will consider two kinds of vertices , of type @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "a vertex of type @xmath63 is the ordinary vertex and appears with a factor @xmath65 in feynman diagrams .",
    "a vertex of type @xmath64 is the opposite of a @xmath63 vertex , and its feynman rule is @xmath66 .",
    "likewise , for insertions of the source @xmath20 , insertions of type @xmath63 appear with the factor @xmath67 while insertions of type @xmath64 appear instead with @xmath68 .",
    "the motivation for introducing these additional vertices and sources will become clearer shortly .    for each feynman diagram @xmath69 containing only `` + '' vertices and sources ( denoted henceforth as @xmath70 ) contributing to the sum of connected vacuum - vacuum diagrams , define a corresponding set of diagrams @xmath71 by assigning the symbol @xmath72 to the vertex @xmath73 of the original diagram ( and connecting a vertex of type @xmath74 to a vertex of type @xmath75 with the propagator @xmath76 ) .",
    "each @xmath72 can be either of the `` + '' or `` - '' type .",
    "the generalized set of diagrams includes @xmath77 such diagrams if the original diagram had @xmath9 vertex and sources .",
    "these diagrams obey the so - called `` largest time equation ''  @xcite .",
    "if one examines these diagrams before the times at the vertices and sources have been integrated out , and assumes that the vertex or source with the largest time is numbered @xmath73 , it is easy to prove that @xmath78 where the dots denote the exact same configuration of @xmath74 s in both terms , for the vertices and sources that do not carry the largest time .",
    "this equation generalizes immediately to the constraint , @xmath79 where the sum is extended to the @xmath77 possible configurations of the @xmath74 s in the feynman diagram of interest  .",
    "this well known identity , being true for arbitrary times and positions of the vertices and sources , is also valid for the fourier transforms of the corresponding diagrams . to see this , we first write down the explicit expressions for the fourier transforms of the propagators",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 is the complex conjugate of @xmath83 .",
    "using these relations , one can show that @xmath84 we can therefore rewrite the imaginary part of the original feynman diagram @xmath85 as @xmath86 where the prime in the sum indicates that the two terms where all the vertices and sources are of type @xmath63 or all of type @xmath64 are excluded from the sum .    for a given term in the right hand side of the above formula",
    ", one can divide the diagram in several disconnected subgraphs , each containing only @xmath63 or only @xmath64 vertices and sources . the @xmath63 regions and @xmath64 regions of the diagram",
    "are separated by a `` cut ''  each diagram in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cut1 ] ) is therefore a  cut vacuum - vacuum diagram \" . at tree level , the first terms generated by these cutting rules ( applied to compute the imaginary part of the sum of connected vacuum - vacuum diagrams ) are 1=to 8 cm @xmath87=\\quad\\;\\raise -24mm\\box1\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\;\\ , + \\cdots \\label{eq : a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath63 and @xmath64 signs adjacent to the grey line in each diagram here indicate the side on which the set of @xmath63 and @xmath64 vertices is located .",
    "as one can see , there are cuts intercepting more than one propagator . in the following",
    ", a cut going through @xmath88 propagators will be called a `` @xmath88-particle cut '' .",
    "it is important to note that cut vacuum - vacuum diagrams would be zero in the vacuum because energy can not flow from from one side of the cut to the other in the absence of external legs .",
    "this constraint is removed if the fields are coupled to * time - dependent * external sources .",
    "thus , in this case , cut vacuum - vacuum diagrams , and therefore the imaginary part of vacuum - vacuum diagrams , differ from zero .",
    "all transition amplitudes contain the factor @xmath89\\big)$ ] , which , in the squared amplitudes , transforms to the factor @xmath90\\big)$ ] .",
    "the power counting rules derived earlier tell us that the sum of all the connected vacuum - vacuum diagrams starts at order because we shall assume the fields are strong and this combination is of order unity .",
    "all the coefficients in the expressions we write in this section depend implicitly on @xmath91 . ]",
    "hence , we will write @xmath92-{\\cal v}^*[j ] ) } = 2\\,{\\rm im}\\,{\\cal v}[j ]   \\equiv \\frac{a}{g^2}\\ ; , \\label{eq : im - v}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 denotes a series in @xmath94 that starts at order @xmath95 ; the coefficients of this series are functions of @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the vacuum - to - vacuum transition probability is @xmath96 .",
    "the simplest tree diagrams entering in @xmath97 were displayed in eq .",

    "a review of early work can be found in ref .",
    "applications of agk rules to reggeon field theory models of particle production in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions were discussed at length by koplik and mueller  @xcite . more recently , several authors considered the application of these rules in perturbative qcd . for a comprehensive recent discussion ,",

    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "we note that agk rules have also been considered previously in the mueller dipole picture  @xcite of saturation / cgc  @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion and additional references can be found in @xcite .",
    "the agk relations are a set of identities that relate the average multiplicity of particles produced in hadronic collisions to the multiplicity of a single cut reggeon .",
    "thanks to these identities , all the other contributions to the average multiplicity involving more than one reggeon exchange ( where the reggeons that are not cut correspond to absorptive corrections ) cancel in the calculation of the average multiplicity .",
    "even though our discussion is based on a completely different theory , one can obtain a set of identities that play the same role as the original agk identities . to see these ,",

    "it is also instructive to note that these identities obeyed by the distribution of cut / uncut disconnected subdiagrams have been obtained by `` integrating out '' the number @xmath9 of produced particles . by doing so",
    ", one goes from the distribution ( [ eq : regg - pnp ] )  which still depends on all the quantities @xmath308  to ( [ eq : regg - p ] ) , in which all the dynamics is summarized in one number @xmath309 . integrating out the number of particles has the virtue of hiding most of the details of the field theory under consideration .",
    "this is in fact the reason why the agk identities have a range of validity which is much wider than the reggeons models for which they had been derived originally .",
    "however , this robustness has a cost : by integrating out the number of particles , one has lost a lot of information about the details of the theory , which means that certain questions can no longer be addressed . for instance , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nfact ] ) , the factor @xmath310  the average number of particles produced in one cut subdiagram  can only be calculated by going back to the microscopic dynamics of the theory under consideration .      in the original approach of abramovsky ,",

    "this second step in general requires a more microscopic description of what one means by `` reggeons ''    the advantage of our approach is of course that it is entirely formulated as a field theory in which the elementary objects are particles .",

    "the cancellations discussed in the previous subsection , which are in fact responsible for the identity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : agk - rhs2 ] ) , are crucial in order to be able to calculate the particle multiplicity in a simple way .",
    "we have seen explicitly that one can calculate the multiplicity at leading order directly from the classical field @xmath210 , and in principle at higher orders as well .",
    "of course , the nlo calculation has the complications of a typical 1-loop calculation ; in particular one has to treat the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "it turns out that higher moments of the multiplicity distribution are also calculable from @xmath210 , by formulas that are tractable even though they are more complicated than in the case of the multiplicity .",

    "our studies were indeed motivated by their possible relevance to hadronic collisions at very high energies .",
    "in particular , in the color glass condensate approach , hadronic collisions at very high energies are described by an effective field theory where the degrees of freedom are wee parton fields coupled to strong time dependent external valence sources .",
    "a key feature of the cgc approach is that weak coupling techniques are applicable .",
    "the techniques developed here can therefore be applied to study particle production .",
    "of particular interest is particle production in the earliest stages of heavy ion collisions , and the possibility that one can understand the thermalization of a quark gluon plasma from first principles . as is immediately clear from the formalism developed here , the solution of such problems is intrinsically non  perturbative ( even in weak coupling ) requiring the summation of infinite series of feynman graphs .",

    "are very complicated non - linear relations when expressed in terms of the coefficients @xmath342 , because of the prefactor @xmath340 . in order to investigate their consequences , it is much easier to introduce the function @xmath346 note that the prefactor @xmath340 is nothing but @xmath347 .",
    "therefore , if we consider the following generating function for the probabilities @xmath307 , @xmath348 it is related to @xmath349 via  : @xmath350 recalling now that @xmath351 and using eqs .",
