    "a parameterised family @xmath1 , is shown to generate all unitaries over @xmath4 . adding the unitary operator @xmath2 defined over @xmath5 , one obtains a set of generators for all unitary maps over @xmath0 , for any @xmath6 .",

    "this property is commonly referred to as _",
    "universality_. one also obtains arbitrarily close approximations using only @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "this special choice of generators , which - as far as we know - was never considered before , was obtained by looking at the simplest possible 1-qubit measurements patterns in the one - way model  @xcite .",

    "we develop a notation for measurement processes , which we use to describe measurement processes using two qubits each , and implementing the generators of the first section .",
    "these processes are proved to be universal in the sense explained above .",

    ", we show an implementation of the controlled-@xmath3 family using only 14 qubits .",
    "it turns out that the underlying entanglement graph for controlled-@xmath3 has no odd - length cycle .",
    "such specific graphs have been recently shown to yield entangled states which are robust against decoherence  @xcite , and we show that any general unitary can be implemented in the one - way model using one of these .",

    "one could also have both @xmath17 and @xmath16 as generators .",

    "we havent found any expression leading to a cheaper implementation .",
    "having all unitaries @xmath3 over @xmath4 and all unitaries of the form @xmath25 over @xmath5 we can conclude to universality  @xcite : the set @xmath34 generates all unitaries .",
    "the following unitaries @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , are known to be _ approximately universal _",
    ", in the sense that any unitary can be approximated within any precision by combining these  @xcite",
    ". therefore the set @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 is also approximately universal .",
    "so far we have obtained a generating set for unitaries which compares well with the usual one based on @xmath38 and general rotations @xmath39 , in that our 1-qubit family of unitaries has only one parameter . as we have noted earlier",
    ", another advantage of our generating set is that @xmath1 and @xmath2 have realisations in the one - way model using fewer qubits .",
    "this is the topic of this section .",
    "measurement based models  @xcite have been recently brought to the fore , notably the _ one - way _ model  @xcite .",
    "one reason why this universal model is particularly interesting is that it might lead to easier implementation  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a quick recapitulation of the one - way model .",
    "computations involve combinations of 2-qubit entanglement operators @xmath40 , 1-qubit measurements @xmath41 , and 1-qubit pauli corrections @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 represent the qubits on which each of these operations apply , and @xmath18 is a parameter in @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "such combinations , together with two distinguished set of qubits ( possibly overlapping ) corresponding to inputs and outputs , will be called _ measurement patterns _ , or simply patterns .",
    "one can associate an _ entanglement graph _ to any pattern , where the vertices are the pattern qubits , and the ( undirected ) edges are given by the @xmath40 operators  @xcite .",
    "importantly , in a pattern , corrections are allowed to depend on previous measurement outcomes .",
    "there is also a parallel notion of dependent measurements , but we will not use it here .    to be more specific , @xmath41 is an @xmath47-measurement , defined by a pair of complement orthogonal projections , applied at qubit @xmath44 , on the following vectors : conventionally , we take measurement outcomes to range in @xmath48 , @xmath49 corresponding to a collapse to @xmath50 , and @xmath51 to a collapse to @xmath52 .",
    "since qubits are measured at most once , we may represent unambiguously the outcome of the measurement done at qubit @xmath44 by @xmath53 .",
    "dependent correction will be written @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "their meaning is that @xmath57 ( no correction is applied ) , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "now that we have a notation , we may describe the two patterns implementing our generators : in the first pattern @xmath51 is the only input and @xmath60 is the only output , while in the second both @xmath51 and @xmath60 are inputs and outputs ( note that we are allowing patterns to have overlapping inputs and outputs ) .",
    "these patterns are indeed among the simplest possible .",
    "remarkably , there is only one single dependency overall , which occurs in the correction phase of @xmath11 .",
    "no set of patterns without any measurement could be a generating set , since those can only implement unitaries in the clifford group .",
    "dependencies are also likely to be needed for universality , but for the moment we do not have a proof for this .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath11 and @xmath61 respectively implement @xmath1 and @xmath62 . combining these two patterns , by composition and tensoring ,",
    "will therefore generate patterns realising all unitaries over @xmath0 .      to conclude",
    ", we describe the entanglement graph needed for @xmath25 , according to the decomposition given in lemma  [ controlledu ] .",
    "as we see in figure  [ controlled - u ] this graph has a single cycle of length  6 .",

    "say a path is _ extreme _ in a graph with inputs and outputs , if it goes from the boundary to itself ; say a graph with inputs and outputs is _ even _",
    "if all its extreme paths are of even length ; say a pattern is even if its entanglement graph is .",
    "we may then rephrase the last observation by saying that the pattern for @xmath25 is even .",
    "patterns with empty command sequence , among which one finds those implementing permutations over @xmath0 , are even .",
    "indeed , all their paths , therefore all their extreme paths are of length zero , and zero is even .",
    "even patterns are closed under tensorisation and composition .",
    "the first point is clear , because the graph associated to a tensor of two patterns is the juxtaposition of the components graphs , and therefore it has a path space which is the disjoint sum of the path spaces of its components .    for the second point , we note that any extreme path in a composite pattern is a product of extreme paths of the components , and has therefore even length , because the sum of evens is even .    any unitary",
    "can be realised by a pattern with a 2-colourable underlying graph . any unitary",
    "can be realised by a pattern obtained from the @xmath67-decomposition pattern ( using 5 qubits ) , the @xmath25 pattern , and the permutation patterns , combined by tensor and composition .",
    "any cycle in such a pattern is ( 1 ) either a cycle internal to some basic pattern ( which rules out @xmath67-decomposition and permutation patterns which have a linear entanglement graph ) , so living inside a @xmath25 pattern , therefore of length @xmath68 , therefore even , as we have seen , or ( 2 ) a product of extreme paths , therefore even , because all basic patterns are even , and by the lemma above , so is any combination of them .",
    "as said in the introduction , 2-colourable entanglement graphs are interesting since their associated graph states are robust against decoherence  @xcite .",
    "we have shown a simple set of generators for the group of unitary maps over @xmath0 which has not been considered before as far as we know .",
    "this set might be of general interest for the understanding and manipulation of the unitary group .    however , our primary interest was to use it as a way to understand the measurement - based quantum computing model known as the one - way model  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this set yields parsimonious implementations of unitaries in the one - way model .",
    "moreover , we were able to show that the entanglement graphs underlying these implementations can always be chosen to be 2-colourable .",
    "such graphs lead to entangled states belonging to the family of graph states for which physical implementations are well underway  @xcite .",
    "purification protocols exist for the particular subclass of 2-colourable graph states , which make them physically implementable in a way that is robust against decoherence  @xcite ."
