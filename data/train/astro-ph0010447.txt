    "very few true white dwarfs are known to have effective temperatures above @xmath1k and , therefore , the proposed direct evolutionary link between h - rich cspn and white dwarfs has hardly been explored .",

    "et  al . _  1994",
    "; egb1 - 100000k , napiwotzki &  schnberner 1993 ; wdhs1 - 100000 to 160000k , liebert , bergeron &  tweedy 1994 ) , through various observational programmes , provides an opportunity to study this upper range of the da cooling sequence .",
    "while balmer line analyses ( including the effect of metals ) provide important measurements of the da temperature scale , there remains a serious problem in their use to study the hottest da stars . at effective temperatures in excess of @xmath2k ,",
    "the photospheric hydrogen is almost completely ionized . hence , the populations of the levels involved in the balmer line transitions are severely depleted and the observed line strengths extremely weak . as a result , at high temperatures , the values of",
    "become increasingly poorly determined .",
    "the use of the lyman series lines has provided an additional tool to determine and log g but only a limited number of observations have been available from the _ orfeus _  and hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( _ hut _ ) missions ( e.g. dupuis _ et  al . _  1998",
    "et  al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the availability of the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) , covering the @xmath3  wavelength range , presents us with an opportunity of obtaining many more lyman series spectra for white dwarfs .",
    "we present _ fuse _  observations of the very hot da white dwarfs pg1342 + 444 and rej0558@xmath0376 , comparing the balmer and lyman series measurements of . an important result is the first detection of photospheric ovi lines in the atmosphere of a da white dwarf .",
    "the _ fuse _  mission was placed in low earth orbit on 1999 june 24 .",
    "after several months of in - orbit checkout and calibration activities , science observations began during 1999 december .",
    "an overview of the _ fuse _  mission has been given by moos _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2000 ) and the spectrograph performance is described in detail by sahnow _",
    "et  al . _   ( 2000 ) .",
    "further useful information is included in the _ fuse _  observer s guide ( oegerle _ et  al . _  1998 ) which can be found on the _ fuse _  website ( http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu ) along with other technical documentation .",
    "several problems have been encountered during early in - orbit operations of the _ fuse _  satellite which need to be taken account of in the data reduction process .",
    "maintaining the coalignment of the individual spectral channels has been difficult , probably due to thermal effects .",
    "sometimes , a target may completely miss the aperture of one or more channels , while being well - centred in the others .",
    "in addition , even if the channels are well - aligned at the beginning of an observation , the target may subquently drift out of any of the apertures .",
    "there are also several effects associated with the detectors and electronics , including deadspots and fixed - pattern efficiency variations .",
    "potentially , these can lead to spurious absorption features in the processed data if they cut the dispersed spectrum at any point .",
    "the fuse observations of pg  1342 + 444 and re  j0558@xmath0376 were obtained during 2000 january 11/12 and 1999 december 10 respectively .",
    "inspection of the combined _ fuse _  spectra of each star shows the expected flux levels but reveals some discontinuities in the flux matching particular channel wavelength ranges .",
    "this indicates that in some channels the actual exposure time achieved does not match the nominal value , possibly arising from the source drifting out of the science aperture .",
    "consequently , we examined each individual extracted and calibrated spectrum and developed our own approach to combining the various exposures and channels based on an assessment of the data quality . since , the nominal wavelength binning ( @xmath4 ) oversamples the true resolution by a factor of 2 - 3 , all the spectra were re - binned to 0.02  pixels for analysis .",
    "et  al . _  ( 2000 , in preparation ) describe our procedure in much more detail .",
    "figure  1 shows the final merged spectra constructed from the best exposures in each spectral channel .",
    "a broad dip in the region above @xmath5  can be seen in each case , caused by a region of low instrumental efficiency known as the `` worm '' and which is not currently taken into account in the flux calibration .",
    "the short wavelength region ( sic channel ) of the re  j0558@xmath0276 spectrum , below 990 , is considerably noisier than the longer wavelength ( lif channel ) data due to periods when the source drifted out of the sic aperture during the exposure or was missed completely during acquisition of the target .",
    "a number of apparent emission features seen in pg  1342 + 444 are not stellar features but arise from geocoronal emission .",
    "it is not surprising that absorption lines from both the local ism and the photosphere of the stellar sources are seen in the _ fuse _  spectra .",
    "such features have already been reported in the _ orfeus _  spectra of g191-b2b and re  j0457@xmath0281 ( vennes _ et  al . _",
    "1996 ) , including the detection of s and p , which are not seen in any other wavebands .",
    "however , _ orfeus _  was only able to observed a handful of wds in its limited duration mission . with a planned mission lifetime of at least 2 years and a superior spectral resolution ( @xmath6 ) , _",
    "fuse _  will provide a more comprehensive study of hot wds and is capable of detecting weaker features .",
    "the compressed wavelength scale of figure  1 renders invisible all but the strongest absorption features .",
    "however , closer examination reveals many absorption lines .",
    "for example , the 1120 to 1130 region of the pg  1342 + 444 spectrum shows photospheric siiv and pv together with interstellar ci and feii ( figure  2 ) .",
    "these same species are seen in re  j0558@xmath0371 , while photospheric civ , svi and fevi are also detected in both objects .",
    "possibly the most interesting result is the presence of the ovi resonance absorption lines at 1031.912  and 1037.613  in both stars ( figure  2 ) , the first detection of ovi in any h - rich wd .",
    "this results also represents the first observation of these resonance features in any wd .",
    "such a high oxygen ionization state is typically associated with the very hot pg1159 stars , being detected at optical wavelengths in those objects ( e.g. werner , heber , &  hunger 1991 ) .",
    "hence , its appearance in a da spectrum might appear to be something of a surprise since , at  70,000k , pg  1342 + 444 and re  j0558@xmath0371 are considerably cooler .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of ovi features is predicted by the model atmosphere calculations .",
    "interestingly , ovi was not detected in the _ orfeus _  spectra of the cooler objects g191-b2b and re  j0457@xmath0281 . table  1 lists the photospheric abundances of all elements detected in the _ fuse _  spectral range , determined using the latest non - lte model calculations , and compares these with values measured from _ orfeus _",
    "data for g191-b2b .",
    ".heavy element abundances ( relative to hydrogen ) determine from _ fuse _",
    "observations of pg  1342 + 444 and re  j0558@xmath0371 , compared to our measurements of the g191-b2b _ orfeus _  and _ hst _  stis spectra . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as has been reported for cooler hot da wds ( barstow , hubeny and holberg 1998 ) , the values of  measured with fully line blanketed , heavy element - rich , non - lte model atmospheres are significantly lower than those reported for pure h analyses .",
    "hence , we must conclude that , overall , the temperature scale of the very hottest white dwarfs such as pg  1342 + 444 and re  j0558@xmath0371 is lower than currently believed .",
    "since these stars , together with other objects in our _ fuse _  programme , were selected on the basis of their location in the temperature range between the hot das , such as g191-b2b , and the cpn , this result seems to reopen a gap between the cpn and the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "however , no cpn have yet been subjected to the same kind of analysis as that applied to these hot das .",
    "it seems likely that a similar reduction in  will be found when such an analysis is carried out .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the uncertainties in the values of   determined from the lyman line work are lower than for the balmer lines .",
    "this probably arises from the fact that the balmer lines become increasingly weak at these high temperatures , whereas the lyman lines are much less affected by this problem .",
    "the respective lyman and balmer line measurements are in good agreement for re  j0558@xmath0371 but there is a 10000k inconsistency between the two pg  1342 + 444 results . at the moment , this is difficult to explain as there are few examples of similar analyses with which to compare these results .",
    "the relative behaviour of lyman and balmer lines can be influenced by assumptions built into the model atmosphere calculations , although in this case we might expect to see differences for all stars .",
    "alternatively , there may be signficant interstellar h opacity in pg  1342 + 444 which has not been properly accounted for in the analysis .",
    "such material would increase the strength of the lyman lines , leading to a lower value of .",
    "we have presented observations of some of the hottest known white dwarfs made with the _ fuse _  spectrometer .",
    "detection of photospheric civ , siiv , ovi , pv , svi and fevi absorption lines allows us to estimate the abundances of these elements , the first such measurements reported for da wds at these high temperatures .",
    "the observed abundances are similar to those found in the somewhat cooler star g191-b2b",
    "( @xmath7k ) . however , pg  1342 + 444 seems to have a large excess of c when compared to both rej  0558@xmath0371 and g191-b2b .",
    "the ovi resonance lines are uniquely present in the _ fuse _  wavelength range , and their detection in the pg  1342 + 444 and re  j0558@xmath0371 spectra is the first such report for any hot white dwarf .",
    "the balmer and lyman line studies yield values of  lower than reported for pure h balmer line studies , as might be expected .",
    "the inconsistency between the pg  1342 + 444 lyman and balmer results sn an issue that requires further investigation .",
    "forthcoming observations of the remaining targets in our sample will help examine whether or not the discrepancy originates in the model atmosphere calculations or arises from systematic effects due to interstellar absorption , or in the _ fuse _  spectrometer calibration .",
    "the work reported in the papers was based on observations made with the _ fuse _  observatory , operated on behalf of nasa by johns hopkins university .",
