    "current planet detection methods provide basic information : a minimum mass if the orbital inclination is not known and an albedo - dependent estimate of surface temperature . in the case of the transiting system , hd  209458 ,",
    "the planet s density is also determined with a possible atmospheric sodium detection ( charbonneau 2002 ) and excess lyman @xmath2 absorption during transit ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "there still remains a lack of constraints on extrasolar planetary structure leaving astronomers to explore new observational probes .",
    "cuntz , saar & musielak ( 2000 ) suggested that there may be an observable interaction between a parent star and a close - in giant planet , specifically an external heating of the star s outer atmosphere .",
    "the effect could be tidal , magnetic , or a combination of the two . in the case of tidal heating ,",
    "the acoustic wave energy thought to contribute to the heating of the upper atmosphere has a dependence on the local turbulent velocity ( @xmath3 ) as @xmath4 ( muzielak et al .",
    "the steepening of the density gradient in the two tidal bulges would increase the turbulent velocity producing excess shocks , waves , and flows in the upper atmosphere of the star .",
    "magnetic wave energy has a @xmath5 dependence ( ulmschneider & muzielak 1998 ) such that an increase in @xmath3 would enhance local dynamo generation and hence the local magnetic energy will also increase . thus , even small increases in @xmath3 would cause a dramatic intensification in nonradiative heating . if planet - induced heating is confined to a narrow range in stellar longitude , the heated regions would track the planet .",
    "this implies that the period of any observed activity would be correlated with the planet s orbit such that tidally induced activity has a period of @xmath6 and magnetic activity , a period of @xmath7 .",
    "it is also possible that the increased dynamo action would be confined to the turbulent layer below the convection zone ( the tachocline ) . in this case",
    ", any dynamo action would be spread out over a wide range of longitudes and the excess heating would not show strong periodic variation ( saar & cuntz 2001 ) .",
    "since the tidal and magnetic interaction depend on the distance from the planet to the star as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , it is best to look at the tightest systems . of the @xmath10  100",
    "known extrasolar planets , 16% have semi - major axes of less than 0.1 au and masses comparable to jupiter s ( schneider 2003 ) .",
    "it is expected that these planets have magnetic fields similar to jupiter s ( 4.3 g ) .",
    "however if tidally locked , the planets fields might be substantially smaller .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume that the magnetic interaction would be greatest in the outermost layers of the star , namely the chromosphere , transition region and the corona due to their proximity to the planets and their nonradiative heat sources .",
    "our program stars have orbital periods between 3.1 and 4.6 days , eccentricities @xmath10 0 and semi - major axes @xmath11 au .",
    "these systems offer the best chance of observing upper atmospheric heating .",
    "the five systems we chose were @xmath1  boo , hd  179949 , hd  209458 , 51  peg and @xmath12  and and their planetary system parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "temperatures in the chromosphere can reach 20,000 k over many scale heights implying that the temperature gradients are not very high .",
    "this is due to the large opacity of resonance lines such as h  i , ca  ii , mg  ii and the lyman continuum which then in the low - density gas radiate and cool the chromosphere .",
    "most chromospheric indicators are uv emission lines not easily accessible from ground - based telescopes . however , the optical resonance lines of ca ii h & k at 3933  and 3968  exhibit chromospheric emission in late - type stars ( later than f0 ) and are sensitive probes of temperature and electron density .",
    "an example of hd  179949 ca  ii h & k reversals are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the double - peaked emission is formed in the chromosphere at t @xmath10 8000  k where the source function is essentially monochromatic .",
    "the central emission is produced at a temperature of @xmath10 20,000  k ( montes et al . 1994 ) which appears as a self - reversal due to the large optical depth of the line .",
    "the asymmetry of the emission in late - type dwarfs is thought to be a consequence of upflows in the chromosphere s plage - like regions .",
    "( see linsky 1980 for a comprehensive observational and theoretical review . )",
    "the broad , deep photospheric absorption and the low level background continuum allow the reversal to be seen at higher contrast . because of these and the accessibility of the lines from the ground , the ca  ii h & k reversals are an optimal choice with which to monitor chromospheric heating for the sun - like stars known to host short - period giants planets .",
    "saar and cuntz ( 2001 ) looked at the ca  ii  ir line at 8662   , an interlocking line with the ca  ii h & k resonance lines , with spectra of resolution r = 50,000 and s / n typically of 200 .",
    "they looked at five stars with close - in giant planets ( including @xmath1  boo , @xmath12  and , and 51  peg ) by simulating the ir equivalent to the mt .",
    "wilson @xmath13 index and found nothing at the 3 to 5% level .",
    "high - resolution ( r = 110,000 ) and high signal - to - noise ( s / n @xmath14 500 per pixel in the continuum and 150 in the h & k cores ) spectra were obtained on 3 observing runs at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) with the fiber - fed coud spectrograph , @xmath15 .",
    "the single spectrum spanned 60  and was centered on 3947  .",
    "a representative spectrum of hd  179949 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "five nights were allocated in each of three semesters : august 2001 , july 2002 and august 2002 .",
    "poor weather and technical issues limited usable data to @xmath10 10 nights .",
    "spectra with comparable s / n were taken of two stars known not to have close - in giant planets , @xmath1 ceti and the sun ( sky spectra were taken at dusk ) .    the data reduction consisted of the subtraction of the appropriate darks from the stellar , arc and flat - field exposures rather than using the convential biases to remove the baseline from each observation .",
    "the flats were combined and normalized to a mean value of 1 along each row of the dispersion axis .",
    "all the stellar exposures for each night were averaged in order to define a single aperture to use for the spectral extraction .",
    "this included a subtraction of the residual background level between orders .",
    "the aperture was used to extract 1-dimensional spectra from the stellar , comparison and flat - field exposures .",
    "a mean , normalized 1-dimensional flat was divided into the extracted spectra to obtain the most consistent flat - fielded spectra possible .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done with thorium - argon arcs .",
    "heliocentric and differential radial velocity corrections were applied . in 2001 th - ar arcs",
    "were taken with every target while in the 2002 observing runs , each stellar exposure was bracketed with an arc .",
    "this allowed differential radial velocities ( @xmath16@xmath17 ) to be measured to better than 20 m / s .",
    "detailed discussion on the @xmath17 can be found in walker et al .",
    "current orbital ephemerides and hence accurate phases ( @xmath18 ) were determined for each observation by fitting a least - squares sine function with the known radial velocity amplitude and orbital period .",
    "a pure sinusoid was sufficient since all five systems have eccentricity @xmath19 ( schneider 2003 ) .",
    "table 2 contains the july 2002 times of sub - planetary position along with the revised periods .    for each star , portions of the spectra ,",
    "each 7  wide , were extracted centered on ca  ii h , k and the strong al  i line at 3944  . as a means of normalizing each sub - spectrum ,",
    "the continuum was set to 1 at the ends and fit with a straight line .",
    "the spectra were grouped by date and a nightly mean was computed for each of the three lines .",
    "an overall average was then taken over all the nights from which we measured nightly residuals .",
    "each residual spectrum also had a broad , low - order curvature removed .",

    "the widths of the mad plots ( figure 4 ) are the same as those of the reversals themselves as illustrated in figure 3 for hd  179949 . in the sun s case",
    ", images from the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) aboard the solar heliospheric observatory ( soho ) confirm that the sunspot group was receding which caused the apparent asymmetry of the solar mad plot . the strong coherence between the h and k activity can be seen in figure 5 where the integrated mean absolute deviation for h and k is plotted for each star .",
    "the strong aluminum line shows no comparable variations .",
    "for all the program stars , the mean absolute deviation of the al  i line at 3944 is less than 0.0005 of the normalized mean .",
    "this indicates that the photospheres of the stars are stable to this level providing additional evidence that the variations seen in the ca ii h & k reversals are not caused by upper - level photospheric changes but rather are confined to the chromosphere .",
    "hd 179949 shows the greatest nightly modulation of all the stars in all three observing runs .",
    "the integrated flux of the residuals shown in figure 3 ( bottom ) are plotted against orbital phase in figure 6 .",
    "the emission clearly increases by @xmath10 4% when the planet is in front of the star , at phases near the sub - planetary point ( @xmath29 ) and is least when the planet is behind the star ( @xmath0 0.5 ) .",
    "the amplitude and period of this activity has persisted during the year between observations ( equal to 108 orbits or at least 37 stellar rotations ) .",
    "a periodogram of even these few data points ( stellingwerf 1978 ) produces the most significant peak with a period of 3 days .",

    "the peak of the model leads the sub - planetary point by 0.17 in phase .",
    "if this effect is real , it could provide a constraint on future models of the interaction .",
    "since ca  ii emission is optically thin outside the self - absorption core , limb brightening needs to be included in the model . according to solar observations discussed by engvold ( 1966 ) , limb brightening would increase emission by 3% , essentially not changing the geometric model .",
    "the best - fit spot model requires the bright spot to be at a latitude of @xmath32 and a stellar inclination angle @xmath26 of @xmath33 .",
    "since there were no transits detected for this system , an upper limit for the orbital inclination is set at @xmath34 ( tinney et al .",
    "2001 ) . the dashed model in figure 6",
    "has @xmath35 as it is generally assumed that the orbital and stellar inclination angles are comparable .",
    "these models are inconsistent with the possibility that the star may be tidally synchronized with the planet s orbit ( @xmath36 ) . however , from figure 2 , the ca  ii  k emission in hd  179949 is unusually strong compared to the other targets .",
    "this implies that either the inclination of the star is low , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 17.5 km s@xmath39 and @xmath40 3 d. ) or that @xmath41 is closer to 9 days and the ca  ii emission is significantly enhanced in hd  179949 relative to the other stars .",
    "if the star is indeed tidally synchonized with the planet , as is believed to be the case for @xmath1  boo , then the modulation in the emission observed with the 3.093-day period may be tracking a persistent stellar surface feature . however , tidal synchronization of hd  179949 is not a favoured scenario for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the tidal synchonization timescale for the system @xmath14 700 gyr using a @xmath42sin@xmath43 .",
    "( see equation 1 of drake et al .",
    "even if @xmath44 , as would be the case for @xmath25 = 17.5 km s@xmath39 and @xmath45 , then the sychronization timescale is still very long at 79 gyr .",
    "secondly , rosat x - ray data list hd  179949 as having at least double the x - ray flux ( a measurement independent of @xmath26 ) as compared to other single f8 - 9 dwarfs and @xmath10 10 times that of the sun s .",

    "( 1998 ) report the x - ray flux for hd  179949 to be @xmath46 = 41.0 @xmath47",
    "erg / s while for 36  uma , a nearly identical star , @xmath46 = 18.4 @xmath47 erg / s .",
    "from the sample of stars observed , those with planets ( with the exception of 51  peg ) show significant nightly variation in their ca  ii h & k cores .",
    "ceti which has no close planet remained very steady over all three observing runs .",
    "the sun s ca  ii emission was stable within each run .",
    "however , a large naked - eye sunspot grouping appeared in the summer of 2002 and was detected as an enhancement in the h & k reversals accounting for its mad signal ( figure 4 ) . there is enhanced nightly activity in the stars with close - in giant planets whose variations may be cyclical and phase shifted .",
    "further observations of these systems at varying orbital phases are required .    in the one clear case , hd",
    "179949 exhibits repeated phase - dependent activity with enhanced emission near the sub - planetary point and less emission half an orbit later .",
    "this is consistent with a magnetic heating scenario and may be a first indirect glimpse at a magnetosphere of an extrasolar planet .",
    "additional ca ii observations are crucial to confirm the continuity of the magnetic interaction as well as to establish better phase coverage . due to the nearly exact 3-day orbit ,",
    "it is impossible to get many distinct phases during one observing season from the ground .",
    "space based observations will not only increase the phase coverage , but will also allow observations of other activity diagnostics such as transition region and coronal lines in the uv and fuv .",
