    "the recent experimental realization of weakly interacting bose - einstein condensates @xcite has stimulated a large amount of theoretical work on the properties of these condensates .",
    "recently , there has been a great interest in the interference and the establishment of a relative phase@xcite between bose - einstein condensates which start in fock states or as a mixture of coherent states . in this paper",
    "we show by numerical and analytical calculations how a relative phase is established between two independent condensates initially in mixed states .",
    "in particular we look at the quantum interference when the condensates begin in thermal or poisson mixed states . there is a significant difference in the visibility of the interference patterns between these two cases .",
    "we consider two bose - einstein condensates which are dropped on top of each other .",
    "this system was first proposed by javanainen and yoo@xcite .",
    "an example of such a system is a hot wire grid placed below the condensates which acts as an atom detector since it removes atoms from the condensates as they fall under the influence of gravity .",
    "javanainen and yoo showed that a spatial interference pattern would be observed illustrating the presence of a relative phase between the falling condensates .",
    "we will show here that this relative phase is also present when the initial states of the condensates are no longer a pure fock state of known number but are a mixture of number states .",
    "this corresponds physically to the situation where we are uncertain of the initial number of atoms in each condensate .",
    "we shall take this mixture to have a number distribution @xmath1 giving an initial density operator of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to the first and second condensate respectively .",
    "the spatial interference is established since when we detect the atoms from the condensates we are unaware which condensate the atom came from .",
    "this interference pattern is built up from the spatial detections of individual atoms .",
    "after @xmath5 detections we observe atoms at positions @xmath6 .",
    "if we denote the field operator for the detection of an atom at @xmath7 as @xmath8 then the joint probability of @xmath5 detections at the @xmath9 positions is @xmath10 where the symbol * tr * denotes the trace over the @xmath3 and @xmath4 number states .",

    "the expression for the joint probability above shows that it is a weighted sum of probabilities over fixed numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 of initial numbers of atoms in each condensate .",
