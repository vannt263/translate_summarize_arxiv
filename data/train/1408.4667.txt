    "transverse localized structures often called cavity solitons were observed experimentally in vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser ( vcsel ) @xcite . due to the maturity of the semiconductor technology and the possible applications of localized structures of light in all - optical delay lines @xcite and logic gates @xcite ,",
    "these structures in vcsels have been a subject of an active research in the field of nonlinear optics .",
    "moreover , the fast response time of vcsels makes them attractive devices for potential applications in all - optical control of light .",
    "localized structures appear as solitary peaks or dips on homogeneous background of the field emitted by a nonlinear microresonator with a high fresnel number . here , we report experimental evidence of spontaneous formation of localized structures in a 80 @xmath0 m diameter vcsel biased above the lasing threshold and under optical injection . such localized structures are bistable with the injected beam power and the vcsel current .",
    "various mechanisms have proven to be responsible for the generation of localized structures ( ls ) in vcsels : coherent optical injection ( holding beam , i.e. the part of the optical injection that is used to ensure bistability of the system ) in combination with a narrow writing beam ( the part of optical injection which is used to locally make the system evolve from the lower branch of the bistability curve to the higher branch and vice versa)@xcite , frequency selective feedback with @xcite or without @xcite a writing beam , saturable absorption @xcite , amplifiers @xcite , optically injected lasers @xcite , `` spatial translational coupling '' introduced in @xcite , and others ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "ls can start to move spontaneously in the laser transverse section in the presence of saturable absorption @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the case when the pump beam has a circular shape ls move along the boundary on a circular trajectory @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that they can undergo a spontaneous motion under the thermal effects @xcite .",
    "delayed feedback control is a well documented technique that has been applied to various spatially extended systems in optics , hydrodynamics , chemistry , and biology .",
    "it has been demonstrated recently that a simple feedback loop provides a robust and a controllable mechanism for the motion of localized structures ( ls ) and localized patterns @xcite .",
    "these works demonstrated that when the product of the delay time and the feedback rate exceeds some threshold value , localized structures start to move in an arbitrary direction in the transverse section of the device . in these studies ,",
    "the analysis was restricted to the specific case of nascent optical bistability described by the real swift - hohenberg equation with a real feedback term .",
    "more recently , analytical study supported by numerical simulations revealed the role of the phase of the delayed feedback and the carrier lifetime on the motion of cavity solitons in a broad - area vcsel structure , driven by a coherent externally injected beam .",
    "we show that for certain values of the feedback phase ls can be destabilized via a drift bifurcation leading to a spontaneous motion of a solitary two - dimensional ls @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate also that the slower is the carrier decay rate in the semiconductor medium , the higher is the threshold associated with the motion of cavity solitons .",

    "the holding ( injection ) beam is provided by a commercial tunable semiconductor laser ( sacher lasertechnik tec100 - 0960 - 60 external cavity diode laser ) , isolated from the rest of the setup by an optical isolator ( ofr io5-tis2-hp ) .",
    "the long - term electrical and temperature stability of this laser are less than 20 ma rms and 0.05 @xmath5c , respectively .",
    "a half - wave plate is used to adjust the linear polarization of the holding beam to be the same as the one of the vcsel .",
    "the injection beam power is tuned using a variable optical density filter .",
    "the detuning between the master laser and the vcsel is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the frequency of the injection beam , and @xmath8 the frequency of the strongest peak in the spectrum of the stand - alone vcsel .",
    "it is experimentally tuned by changing the wavelength of the injection beam .",
    "the beam waist @xmath9 is defined as the diameter of the smallest circle in the plane of propagation of the injection beam containing half of the beam power when it encounters the vcsel .",
    "the power of the source is monitored by a newport 818-sl photodiode connected to a newport 2832-c powermeter .",
