    "in the present research , we address a very important and unanswered so far question regarding the binomial - tree approach to the tsiveriotis - fernandes ( tf ) model for pricing convertible bonds ( cbs ) .",
    "namely , does the binomial - tree framework provide accurate pricing , hedging and risk assessment ?",
    "we show on a set of representative examples that by applying the binomial - tree methodology one is unable to provide a consistent analysis of the pricing , hedging and risk assessment .",
    "an important feature of the pricing of cbs is that similar to the american options there is no closed form solution , and the numerical computation of the solution is a challenge due to the free boundaries arising . respectively , in our study we will employ the natural properties of cbs which are usually exploited in practice . depending on the underlying stock",
    "we examine the profile of cb s price , of cb s sensitivities , convertible arbitrage strategy , and the monte carlo @xmath0 estimation .",
    "convertible bonds are a widely used type of contract , playing a major role in the financing of the companies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . from a pricing and hedging perspective",
    "they are highly complex instruments .",
    "they have the early exercise feature of american options but in three forms : the option to be converted , the option to be called and the option to be put .",
    "hence , sometimes they behave like a bond and sometimes like a stock .",
    "convertible bonds ( or simply `` convertibles '' ) are bonds issued by a company where the holder has the option to exchange ( to convert ) the bonds for the company s stock at certain times in the future ( @xcite ) .",
    "the `` conversion ratio '' is the number of shares of stock obtained for one bond ( this can be a function of time ) .",
    "if the conversion option is executed , then the rights to future coupons are lost .",
    "the bonds are almost always callable ( i.e. , the issuer has the right to buy them back at certain times at predetermined prices ) .",
    "the holder always has the right to convert the bond once it has been called .",
    "the call feature is therefore usually a way of forcing conversion earlier than the holder would otherwise choose .",
    "sometimes the holder s `` call option '' is conditional on the price of the company s stock being above a certain level .",
    "some convertible bonds incorporate a put feature .",
    "this right permits the holder of the bond to return it to the issuing company for a predetermined amount .    throughout the years",
    "different convertible bond pricing methodologies were developed .",
    "the main development was in the area of modeling the cb s price dynamics , as well as towards design of numerical methods for evaluating the convertible bond pricing function .",
    "the most advanced and popular idea for modeling cb s price dynamics was introduced in the seminal paper of tsiveriotis and fernandes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they have proposed to split the convertible bond value into two components : a cash - only part which is subject to credit risk , and an equity part , which is independent of the credit risk .",
    "this leads to a pair of coupled partial differential equations under certain constraints ( in fact boundary and free boundary conditions ) that can be solved to value the price of the convertibles . from numerical point of view tsiveriotis and fernandes",
    "have proposed explicit finite difference method for solving their system of equations . on the other hand , hull ( @xcite )",
    "has proposed to use binomial - tree approach for solving the same system .",
    "more precisely , the hull approach is based on cox , ross and rubinstein ( crr ) tree",
    ".    currently , there are two basic approaches for cb pricing , hedging and risk assessment .",
    "the first one that is based on trees ( binomial and trinomial ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and the second one which is based on finite difference techniques ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a gap in the above studies as they do not provide a complete report on the methodology performance . by the present paper we want to indicate essential drawbacks of the binomial - tree methodology and mistakes that are made when this methodology is used , in major practice areas as hedging and risk assessment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sectionbintv ] we explain the binomial - tree scheme for approximation of the tf model .",
    "our main results are in section [ sectionperfev ] where we provide the performance valuation .",
    "finally , in the appendix in section [ sectiontf ] we provide a short but closed and informative outline of the model of tsiveriotis - fernandes .",
    "we follow the binomial - tree approximation to the tf model that is widely used in practice ( cf .",
    "it involves modeling the issuer s stock price .",
    "it is assumed that the stock price process follows geometric brownian motion and its dynamics is represented by the usual binomial - tree of cox , ross and rubinstein .",
    "the life of the tree denoted by @xmath1 is set equal to the life of the convertible bond denoted also by @xmath2 the value of the convertible bond at the final nodes ( at time @xmath1 ) of the tree is calculated based on the conversion option that the holder has at that time @xmath2 we then roll back through the tree .    at nodes where the terms of the instrument allow calling back the bond , we test whether the position of the issuer can be improved by calling the bond .",
    "we also test whether the terms of the instrument allow improvement of the holder s position by selling back the bond to the issuer . finally , we test whether conversion is optimal .",
    "this is equivalent to setting the convertible bond value denoted as usually by @xmath3 at a node equal to @xmath4;\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the value given by the rollback ( assuming that the bond is neither converted nor called , nor putted at the node ) , @xmath6 refers to the _ dirty call price _ , @xmath7 refers to the _ dirty put price _ , and @xmath8 is the value if conversion takes place .",
    "following the idea of tsiveriotis and fernandes , the value of the bond at each node is represented as a sum of two components , @xmath9 namely , a component @xmath10 that arises from situations where the bond ends up as equity , and a component @xmath11 that arises from the situations where the bond ends up as a debt .",
    "in addition , the computation of the equity component @xmath10 of @xmath5 is based on _ risk - free discount rate _ , and the debt component @xmath11 of the @xmath5 is based on _ risky discount rate_.    in order to complete the credit risk concept of tf model , we assume a non - zero value for the debt component @xmath11 only when either cash redemption at maturity or put back of the bond takes place ( @xcite eq . 6 & 12 , @xcite eq .",
    "in our practice we have met a lot of examples for which the binomial - tree approach of tf model has unsatisfactory performance . to demonstrate this we will choose the widely known and typical example presented in the paper of tsiveriotis and fernandes ( @xcite , exhibit 5 ) .",
    "namely , our current performance evaluations are based on terms and conditions that are given in table [ tab:1 ] .",

    "we believe a methodology that is based on binomial - tree approach would lead very often to impossibility to make any consistent analysis .",
    "regarding the underlying stock , the cb price has such important properties as strong - monotonicity and convexity . in this section",
    "we show that the cb price @xmath3 obtained by means of the binary tree method , misses the strong monotonicity and convexity , and exposes spurious oscillations .",
    "this misbehavior is persistent no matter how many steps of the binomial - tree method we use .    to demonstrate the above statements , in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we present the evolution of the cb price @xmath3 during the time till maturity using a binary tree with 500 and 750 time steps , respectively .",
    "the time value 0 , corresponds to the issue date , and the time value 5 , corresponds to the maturity date . for reader s",
    "convenience on figure [ fig3 ] we provide the section @xmath15 of the cb price @xmath3 of figure [ fig1]@xmath16 i.e. we look at @xmath17 years after the issue date .",
    "it is clearly seen that it is not convex and not strictly monotone in the range of @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 also , on figure [ fig4 ] we provided @xmath15 of the cb price of figure [ fig2 ] and have the same observations as above .",
    "let us emphasize that for @xmath21 tree steps we have a tree levels at every @xmath22 days or so , and for @xmath23 tree steps  every @xmath17 days or so .",

    "+ cb delta sometimes referred to as hedge ratio , is the number of units of the stock we should short for each cb that we hold in order to create a risk - less portfolio . on the other hand , it is the slope of the curve that relates the cb price to the underlying stock price .",
    "thus , the natural definition of cb delta is @xmath24 traders and market makers prefer to use the following form of delta to illustrate the equity sensitivity of the convertible bond ( @xcite , p. @xmath25 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 refers to the conversion ratio ( the number of shares per 100 nominal that bond holder gets when converting the bond ) .",
    "this number ranges between 0 and 100% whereas the previous delta definition would have values in the interval @xmath28 $ ] . + cb gamma is a representative measure for convexity or non - linearity of the instrument .",
    "it measures the change in @xmath29 for a change in the price of the underlying common stock .",
    "@xmath30 from a hedging point of view , cb gamma illustrates how often the position must be re - hedged in order to maintain a delta - neutral position .",
    "that is , if gamma is small , delta changes slowly , and adjustments to keep a position delta - neutral need to be made only relatively infrequently . however ,",
    "if the absolute value of gamma is large , delta is highly sensitive to the price of the underlying asset .",
    "it is then quite risky to leave a delta - neutral position unchanged for any length of time .",
    "+ as we have seen , the path dependency and the possibilities of terminating the bond before the maturity date , prohibit the derivation of a closed form pricing formula .",
    "thus , the absence of closed form formula imposes the use of numerical methods to calculate the greeks .",
    "+ finally , let us remark that it is a notorious fact that finite differences provide a bad approximation to delta and gamma , and are also computationally expensive .",
    "a satisfactory approach has been given for the computation of delta in ( @xcite , @xcite ) and for the computation of gamma , in ( @xcite ) , and we will follow these references .",
    "+ within the binomial - tree framework convertible bond delta is defined by ( cf .",

    "+ in a similar way , the convertible bond gamma is defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the value of delta at one step forward for the stock price @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the value of delta at one step forward for the stock price @xmath45 .",
    "are different in @xcite and @xcite , they provide the same approximation . ] + now , let us come back to market activities as pricing ( dollar nuking or delta neutral pricing , @xcite ) , analyzing and hedging where the existence of delta is of crucial importance .",
    "+ using the example from table [ tab:1 ] , in this section we demonstrate that throughout half of the cb life - span there exist stock prices for which the convertible bond delta is not well defined and atypically oscillates although the computation that we have made where based on large number of time steps . similarly to the results of delta , the results for the convertible bond gamma are quite inconsistent .",
    "+ in support of the above statements , in figure [ fig5 ] and figure [ fig6 ] we present the evolution of the cb delta and gamma during the time till maturity using a binary tree with 500 time steps .",
    "as before , the time value 0 corresponds to the issue date , and the time value 5 , corresponds to the maturity date . also , in order to ease the reader , we look at 2 years after the issue date , and in figure [ fig7 ] and figure [ fig8 ] we exhibit the profile of cb delta and gamma on the basis of 500 tree steps , namely the one - dimensional sections @xmath46 and @xmath47 both figures in identical way highlight the wrong performance of the approach corresponding to convertible bond delta and gamma .",

    "convertible arbitrage is a market - neutral investment strategy often employed by hedge funds ( arbitrageurs ) .",
    "it involves the simultaneous purchase of convertible securities and the short sale of the same issuer s common stock .",
    "the number of shares sold short usually reflects a delta - neutral or market - neutral ratio . as a result , under normal market conditions",
    ", the arbitrageur expects the combined position to be insensitive to fluctuations in the price of the underlying stock .",
    "a main reason for the popularity of binary tree methods is that in the financial math community the following myths are widely spread : first , the delta - hedging is only possible in binary tree framework and black - scholes framework , and second , the binomial delta becomes , in the limit of time , the bs delta .    in real life situations",
    "the arbitrageurs expect that the hedged position is insensitive with respect to the fluctuations in the price of the underlying stock .    in the following example we provide the graph of the relative change of the convertible arbitrage strategy ( hedged position ) calculated by means of the binomial - tree , where the shock of the stock price is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the contract size of the position of cb given by table [ tab:1 ] is @xmath49 which is a realistic example .",
    "we assume that the settlement date is the issue date @xmath50 the delta - hedged position ( representing the convertible arbitrage strategy ) is given by @xmath51 while its variation ( resulting by the @xmath48 shock ) is given by @xmath52 the * increment * ( the change ) @xmath53 of the portfolio is given by the difference @xmath54    on figure [ fig9 ] below we see that the binomial - tree with @xmath23 steps does not meet the expectations of the arbitrageur since it oscillates considerably .",
    "[ h ]    500_deltastrategystress.eps      as an example of the bad performance of the binomial - tree approximation to risk assessment we will present a simple case of market risk assessment .",
    "+ market risk assessment explores the impact of market observable variables over the value of an investment ( single position or a portfolio ) .",
    "such variables are stock prices , interest rates , exchange rates etc . which are sometimes referred to as market risk drivers or simply risk drivers . + a commonly used methodology for estimation of market risk is _ value - at - risk _ ( var ) , ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of var arises from the fact that regulators and the financial industry advisory committees recommend var as way of measuring risk .",
    "the real boost in the use of var came when the basel committee on banking supervision adopted banks to use var as an internal model to set their capital requirements .",
    "+ the @xmath0 measure is the highest possible loss over a certain period of time @xmath55 at a given confidence level ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 with confidence level @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 here @xmath56 is the confidence level , @xmath58 usually takes values like @xmath59 or @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the change in the portfolio value , i.e. @xmath62 . as usually portfolio values @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to the initial time and the end of the holding period .",
    "the mostly used holding period , over which the expected convertible bond loss is calculated , is one day or one month ( 22 business days ) .",
    "+ it is clear that to calculate @xmath0 values we need the probability density function of the portfolio value .",
    "the @xmath0 methodologies mainly differ in ways of constructing the probability density function .",
    "the widely used in practice are the following methodologies ( @xcite , @xcite ) :    * parametric method ; * historical simulation ; * monte carlo simulation .",
    "we will apply the mostly used third method , namely , the mc simulation .",
    "the reason is that the parametric method is based on delta and gamma valuation and we have seen in the previous section that their computation by means of the binomial - tree is inefficient .",
    "also , the application of the historical method would require to tie down the evidence with a partial historical environment .",
    "+ let us point out , that the use of binomial - tree approach in building a @xmath0 methodology is too inadequate , due to the fact that the probability density function in many examples of cbs is inadequate . in support of this statement we consider the typical cb example considered in table [ tab:1 ] and provide its simplified @xmath0 analysis as described in table [ tab:2 ] .",

    "we see that @xmath68 exhibits the atypical movements of probability mass caused by the atypical price profile of cb price at the end of the holding period .",

    "in this paper we have made performance evaluation of the widely used and popular techniques of binomial - tree for approximation of the tsiveriotis - fernandes model for price dynamics of cbs .",
    "our results show that in many typical examples the binomial - tree techniques do not meet practitioners criteria .",
    "let us mention that even the simplest fds technique ( the explicit method ) has much better performance and this will be the subject of our next paper .",
    "for reader s convenience in the present section we provide the tsiveriotis - fernandes ( tf ) model for computation of the convertible bonds .",
    "the pricing of cb has two main periods : before @xmath69 , and after @xmath69 when the tsiveriotis - fernandes model has appeared , @xcite .",
    "it represents a major breakthrough in the area which revolutionized the price computation .",
    "first of all , the system of tf represents a prettily complicated system of equations which has solutions with free boundary .",
    "this makes it much more complicated for analysis and numerical solution than the american options .",
