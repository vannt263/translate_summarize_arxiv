    "inverse transitions ( its ) are counterintuitive reversible transitions , where the phase usually considered the more ordered has more entropy than the disordered one . its have been observed experimentally in very different physical systems , ranging from gold nanoclusters to high - tc superconductors @xcite .",
    "such diversity of physical systems displaying its have also triggered intense theoretical interest in which several models have been studied , in particular , magnetic ones because of its simplicity @xcite . from those magnetic models , it is suggested that disorder and frustration would be key ingredients to produce its , freezing ( if ) or even melting ( i m ) @xcite .",
    "however , most of the previously mentioned studies using magnetic models suffer from a limitation .",
    "the disorder comes basically from random bonds ( rb ) between spins .",
    "therefore , it is an open issue whether or not other forms of disorder can contribute to produce its .    the family of blume - emery - griffiths model @xcite as the blume - capel ( bc ) @xcite and ghatak - sherrington ( gs ) ones @xcite have been quite useful to study the its . therefore , they can be also helpful to answer the issue mentioned previously .",
    "these models consider bonds of spins 1 ( @xmath5 ) and a crystal lattice field @xmath6 with phase diagrams exhibiting a tricritical point .",
    "for instance , the gs model with a magnetic random field ( rf ) following a gaussian distribution has been recently applied to study the effects of the rf on its @xcite .",
    "this model is well known to present a reentrant first - order phase transition between the spin glass ( sg ) phase and the paramagnetic ( pm ) one which characterizes an if .",
    "the presence of such rf weakens the pm / sg first - order transition by lowering the tricritical point @xcite .",
    "most important , it tends to suppress the if .",
    "however , such analysis has been done in quite specific conditions : in the limit of strong bond disorder and for a continuous distribution of the rf .",
    "thus , a question remains open : are those effects found previously still present for other regimes than the strong bond disorder and for a discrete distribution of the rf ?",
    "for both cases one can expect that the phase diagram can become richer with the presence of others thermodynamic phases as well as more complex boundary phases @xcite .    for this purpose , we studied here the gs model with the presence of a longitudinal magnetic rf @xmath0 following a bimodal distribution within weak disordered regimes for both the rf and the random bonds .",
    "therefore , the model considers a random bond interaction @xmath1 and the rf @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction @xmath1 follows a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 , which allows one to introduce the bond disorder strength parameter @xmath4 in the problem @xcite .",
    "the disorders are then treated by using the replica method , in which the free energy is obtained within the one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1s - rsb ) approximation @xcite . in the present case , by adjusting the disorder strength @xmath4 parameter , the strong ( @xmath8 ) and non - disordered ( @xmath9 ) regimes can be recovered .",
    "most important , the study of @xmath4 values corresponding to the weak disordered interactions could bring new information concerning mechanisms responsible for the its .",
    "it should also be remarked that the gs model presents the order parameter @xmath10 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eqnova2 ] and [ eqnova4 ] ) related to the diagonal replica elements ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this order parameter can be used to obtain the average number of non - magnetic states per site @xmath12 , which also reflects the capability of the sites to interact or not @xcite .",
    "for instance , the limits @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be related to the fully interacting ( @xmath15 high number of sites with spins @xmath16 ) and the fully no interacting ( @xmath17 high number of sites with @xmath18 ) regimes , respectively . as a consequence , there are two types of pm phases with distinct @xmath19 .",
    "this is an important condition for the existence of the if in the gs model @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bc model with rf following a bimodal distribution is particularly interesting @xcite .",
    "this model does not spontaneously display any it at mean field level .",
    "however , it can also present the two types of pm phases with distinct @xmath19 .",
    "it means that one can have a pm phase with low entropic content .",
    "this fact can be explored to produce an i m in the bc model when an artificial entropic advantage of the interacting states is introduced @xcite .",
    "the i m is characterized by a transition from the pm phase at low temperature to the ordered ferromagnetic ( f ) phase at higher temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , the bimodal rf is able to suppress the low entropic pm phase @xcite , which could break an essential condition to the occurrence of it @xcite in this specific model .",
    "on the other hand , the regime of weak rb in the gs model also introduces a f phase .",
    "however , in this is still not completely obvious if an it can be observed .",
    "thus , one can ask if the weak rb regime could be able to produce the necessary entropic advantage of the ordered phase to present spontaneously an it .",
    "particularly this point has not been yet studied in the context of the it problem .",
    "in addition , the effects of the bimodal rf could be more evident in the region of weak rb disorder . as a consequence ,",
    "the superposition of the rb ( already studied only for strong regimes ) and discrete distributed rf ( well studied in the bc model ) effects on the its could be more carefully analyzed . to accomplish this task ,",
    "the effects of both rb and rf in the gs model can be traced from the behavior of @xmath19 @xcite to the entropic content of thermodynamic phases present in the problem .",
    "a detailed study of effects caused by different disorders on @xmath19 can be important to clarify the mechanism behind the existence of the it in the present approach .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the free energy within the 1s - rsb scheme is found . in sec .",
    "iii , a detailed discussion of phase diagrams is presented .",

    "the model is given by the hamiltonian @xmath20 where the spin variables assume the values @xmath21 , the summation @xmath22 is over any pair of spins and @xmath6 is the crystal field .",

    "after the tricritical point , the phase transition becomes first - order where there are more than one pm and f solutions .",
    "the first - order boundary is then located by comparing the lower free energy of the pm and f ( or sg ) solutions by using the same criteria proposed in ref .",
    "one important point here is that the 1s - rsb ansatz is still unstable against fluctuations in the replica space and the right thermodynamics of the sg solutions can be obtained only with full replica symmetry break method .",
    "however , the 1s - rsb procedure can give reliable results around the phase transition ( including the reentrance ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite are recovered in fig . [ fig1](a ) where there is no reentrant behavior .",

    "[ fig1](b ) displays a reentrance in the first - order pm - f transition that seems to be intensified as @xmath4 increases in fig . [",

    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "in addition , figs . [ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) also indicate the presence of a mixed frustrated @xmath78 phase for low @xmath79 , which is obtained within the 1s - rsb procedure . on the other hand , for the strong disordered regime",
    ", the f phase is replaced by the sg one ( see fig . [ fig1](d ) for @xmath80 ) . in this case",
    "there is a continuous pm- sg phase transition that decreases until a tricritical point @xmath81 with increasing of @xmath58 .",
    "below @xmath81 , a reentrant first - order pm - sg phase transition is obtained which indicates an if . therefore the intensity @xmath4 plays an important role in the first - order reentrant transitions .",
    "most importantly , the results presented in fig . [ fig1 ] suggest that the present model is able to show both the if and the i m .",
    "the precise type of it depends on the strength of the bond disorder .",
    "the mechanism underlying these reentrances can be explained analyzing the entropy @xmath71 and the average number of the non - magnetic sites @xmath19 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) exhibits @xmath71 vs @xmath58 for @xmath77 and several values of @xmath4 at low temperature ( @xmath82 ) . for @xmath83 ( case without reentrance ) ,",
    "the entropy of the ordered f phase is smaller than the pm one at the first - order transition .",
    "however , the entropy of the ordered phase increases with @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the entropy of the pm phase is practically unaffected by increasing @xmath4 , while the entropy of the ordered phase suffers a large increment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) for @xmath84 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) shows the behavior of @xmath19 for the same values of strength of disorder and temperature as fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "this result could elucidate why only the entropy of the f phase is modified when the @xmath4 is adjusted .",
    "basically , the results indicate that @xmath19 of the f phase is increased by @xmath4 .",
    "however , @xmath19 remains unaltered in the pm phase that also presents the higher values of @xmath19 ( high number of sites with spin @xmath18 ) .",
    "in other words the low temperature pm phase presents few spin configurations available when @xmath85 . as a consequence",
    "the entropy of this pm phase is very low even for higher @xmath4 values .",
    "it is in contrast with the high temperature pm phase that shows a strong thermal spin fluctuation .",
    "on the other hand , the bimodal rf causes different effects than those ones caused by @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows the phase boundary for @xmath86 and @xmath9 , where the only effect of disorder comes from the bimodal rf .",
    "it is important to remark that for @xmath83 , a coexistence of ordered fm solutions can appear depending on the value of the rf @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of the present work , only the pm / fm border and the effects of the @xmath59 on it are analyzed . in this case , the critical temperature and the tricritical point are displaced for lower values of @xmath57 and higher values of @xmath58 when @xmath87 increases ( compare fig . [ fig1](a ) with fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "most important , the presence of @xmath87 is unable to produce any reentrant behavior .",
    "[ fig3](b ) allows one to analyze the effects caused by the superposition of both disorders : @xmath86 and @xmath88 .",
    "it exhibits a reentrance ( i m ) attributed to the increase of the random bond disorder that also introduces a mixed phase at very low temperatures .",
    "the analyses of the entropy and @xmath19 in the presence of rf with @xmath9 are accomplished in fig [ fig4 ] . comparing the cases @xmath75 and @xmath86 at low temperature @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , it is possible to observe that not only the entropy of the f phase increases with @xmath59 , but also the entropy of the pm one .",
    "it is important to observe that the entropy of pm phase depends on the strength of the rf disorder .",
    "this increase in @xmath71 in the pm phase can be one of the reasons for the incapability of the rf disorders generate it . the behavior of @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) can help us to understand better this point .",
    "for instance , the @xmath19 is changed by the strength of rf in both phases the ordered and the disordered . in particular , the pm phase at lower temperature presents a diminishment in @xmath19 as @xmath59 increases .",
    "this is an important difference in relation to the random bond disorder . as a consequence",
    "the rf causes an increase in the entropy of the pm phase .",
    "in the present work , the ghatak - sherrington sg model has been studied with the addition of longitudinal magnetic random field ( rf ) @xmath0 .",
    "this study was carried out within the 1s - rsb scheme using a mean field approximation .",
    "this approach can be helpful to elucidate the role of different kind of disorders ( rb and rf ) in the so called inverse transitions , melting or freezing .    according to our results",
    ", the crystal field @xmath6 favors energetically the spin states @xmath18 , that favoring introduces a pm phase for larger @xmath6 .",
    "however , for no disorder ( @xmath9 and @xmath77 ) , the pm entropic content is always larger than that one of the f phase .",
    "however , the situation changes at very lower temperature when the random bond disorder is considered ( @xmath84 ) . for a small strength of bond disorder ( @xmath90 ) the f phase",
    "is still found , but now with larger entropy as compared with the @xmath91 case , while the pm entropy is almost unchanged . in other words , it arises an i m for a certain range of @xmath6 . as the strength of the random bond increases ( @xmath92 ) the sg phase replaces the f order and the if occurs . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a rf increases the entropic content not only of the ordered f or sg phases , but also of the disordered pm phase .",
    "it is important to remark this particular point that the rf causes a strong increase of the pm phase entropy .",
    "therefore , it breaks one of the essential conditions to the occurrence of it that is the existence of a pm phase with lower entropy than the ordered phase .",
    "in fact , the rf tends to couple with the interacting spin states ( @xmath93 ) that can be favored energetically even for higher values of @xmath6 . as a consequence ,",
    "the pm phase at lower temperature with smaller entropy is hard to be found .    to summarize",
    "the main difference between the two kinds of disorder studied here in the it context is the effect caused in the pm phase .",
    "the rfs compete with @xmath6 by increasing the entropy of the pm phase of lower temperatures , while the random bonds affect only the entropic content of the ordered phase favoring the it .",
