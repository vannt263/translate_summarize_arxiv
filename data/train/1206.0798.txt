    ", the so - called lithium purple bronze ( hereafter called lipb ) , has emerged as a paradigm quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) material for studying the stability of luttinger liquid chains against single particle electron hopping @xmath3 between the chains @xcite .",
    "the usual theoretical understanding @xcite and empirical experience is that quasi-1d materials can display such 1d behavior at sufficiently elevated temperatures but that , with decreasing temperature ( t ) , @xmath3 leads to a crossover to some kind of 3d behavior , e.g. , a fermi liquid , or an ordered state such as a charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "because of the excellent fermi surface ( fs ) nesting that is typical of quasi-1d materials , density waves are especially likely . focusing on photoemission spectroscopy but considering other data as well",
    ", this paper explores the possibility that lipb , in spite of excellent fs nesting , does not develop a density wave and crosses over to 3d behavior only when it becomes a superconductor ( sc ) .",
    "if such is true then the sc could well be unconventional , as suggested in a recent paper @xcite reporting that the superconducting critical field is far above the pauli limit .",
    "lipb is a material with overall 3d bonding but whose valence band electronic structure is derived from two parallel zig - zag mo - o chains per unit cell .",
    "the chains lie in well separated planes and receive electrons donated by li ions located out of the planes . early tight binding @xcite and more recent lda",
    "@xcite band calculations agree that the mo - o orbitals of the chains give rise to four bands , two of which ( a , b ) are always below the fermi energy ( ) and two of which ( c , d ) cross .",
    "the resulting fs is quasi-1d but the lda calculations also show some splitting and warping due to single particle hopping @xmath3 between chains both within a unit cell and in neighboring unit cells .",
    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) observes all four bands with the general behavior that is predicted in lda calculations @xcite , including the quasi-1d fs @xcite .",
    "figures presented in later discussions of arpes data show the four bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) in section 3 ) , and the fs and brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) in section 4 ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath3 is discussed in section 6 of the paper .",
    "the physical properties of lipb were first investigated in the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "electrical transport @xcite was found to be highly anisotropic and superconductivity ( sc ) @xcite was observed below t@xmath4 = 1.9 k , albeit not in all samples @xcite and with a variation of t@xmath4 @xcite that might involve the li stoichiometry @xcite or disorder @xcite .",
    "more recent studies @xcite confirm the anisotropic transport but with differences in the absolute values of the resistivities along various axes , and also in the magnitudes of the anisotropy ratios .",
    "these differences may reflect variation in samples and in the method @xcite of the measurement .",
    "the early experimental work found that the resistivity is metallic with decreasing t only down to a minimum at t@xmath5 @xmath6 26 k , below which there is an abrupt upturn .",
    "this finding has been robust over time .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows early data @xcite and more recent data @xcite for the upturn as measured along the 1d direction .",
    "an upturn at the same temperature is also seen for the two directions perpendicular to the chains .",
    "there is yet no consensus as to the origin of this upturn because each proposed explanation requires that one or another piece of data be ignored , be given less weight in the argument , or be left unexplained @xcite .",
    "early discussions ascribed the upturn to anderson localization due to disorder @xcite or to a single particle gap , most likely due to cdw formation @xcite .",
    "both direct and nuanced lines of argument @xcite for and against these two hypotheses have been presented many times in the transport literature .",
    "@xcite is the most comprehensive recent overview of the issue .    .",
    "the coefficients found were @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the inset shows that the data from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite are qualitatively similar .",
    "note that the inset shows the resistivity normalized to its 300k value in order to be comparable with that of ref .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the gap as extracted in ref .  @xcite together with the gap extracted here by using our fit @xmath9 .",
    "also included is a mean - field temperature behavior of a gap @xmath10 calculated with @xmath11=26k .",
    "note that for the much larger mean - field gap , the axis is on the right.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    the disorder hypothesis was proposed @xcite because a number of important expected signatures of a density wave are missing in lipb .",
    "x - ray diffraction studies that have revealed cdw ordering in related materials @xcite have not observed a cdw in lipb in spite of repeated attempts over time @xcite .",
    "low - t optical spectroscopy that has observed single particle gaps in various cdw and sdw materials @xcite finds @xcite in lipb no gap even down to 6 k and 1mev .",
    "this finding would seem to be conclusive for the magnitude of gap ( @xmath6  8 mev ) expected in a mean field description of a cdw transition at t@xmath5 , as seen from the bcs curve of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "comparison to mean field is done here for lack of a better alternative . on the one hand ,",
    "the actual transition temperature for a quasi-1d system is likely controlled by a small @xmath3 and so can be much less than the mean field temperature for a single chain @xcite . in this case",
    "the actual gap could be much larger than that obtained in this estimate .",
    "on the other hand the single chain gap for t=0 can be much reduced from its mean field value by ll fluctuations on the chain , in which case the gap could be smaller than in this estimate .",
    "in fact fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows that the t - dependent gap that is deduced @xcite by describing the upturn as an arrhenius law is slightly smaller than 1mev at low t and so could have gone undetected in the optical work .",
    "such a small gap was invoked as an explanation for the recent and very exciting finding @xcite that a sufficiently large magnetic field applied along the 1d direction can entirely suppress the upturn .",
    "the explanation put forth is that the magnetic field quenches the cdw and hence the gap because zeeman splitting of the bands disrupts fs nesting .",
    "the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite also took up a previous proposal @xcite for a purely electronic cdw , driven entirely by coulomb interactions in a strong coupling limit .",
    "this proposal was made to overcome indications from optical spectroscopy @xcite and thermal expansion @xcite measurements that the lattice has no strong involvement with the upturn , which implies that a conventional cdw involving a periodic lattice distortion does not occur .",
    "while such a purely electronic cdw would be more difficult to detect in the conventional x - ray diffraction performed for lipb to date @xcite , it is certainly not impossible as shown by such an observation for a bechgard salt @xcite .    the great beauty of the experimental magnetoresistance result @xcite and the neatness of the explanation notwithstanding , there is no cdw theory that would explain such an unusual gap function and one must also ignore another important missing signature of a single particle gap @xcite , that the dc magnetic susceptibility measured by three groups over time is entirely unaffected by the resistivity upturn at t@xmath5 . ref .",
    "@xcite points out that because the magnitude of the measured susceptibility involves a near cancelation of several large negative and positive contributions the measurement is particularly sensitive to a change in any one of them , e.g that of the conduction electrons",
    ". this is perhaps the strongest single piece of all the many evidences that collectively weigh heavily against a cdw .",
    "the lack of cdw signatures in lipb is all the more striking because the closely related compounds kmo@xmath1o@xmath12 and namo@xmath1o@xmath2 do exhibit cdw behavior clearly seen with x - ray diffraction @xcite and optics @xcite .",
    "these materials are also planar but have higher symmetry such that the planes contain three mo - o chains oriented at 120 degrees to one another .",
    "the cdw q - vector is such as to gap out the quasi-1d bands associated with two of the three chains .",
    "finally the possibility of an sdw in lipb has been excluded by muon spin relaxation measurements @xcite .",
    "the last section of the paper returns to the issue of the upturn and to the other parts of fig .",
    "early workers did not include the ideas of the luttinger liquid ( ll ) in their thinking .",
    "ll behavior in lipb was first demonstrated by photoemission experiments .",
    "indeed , these experiments were undertaken specifically because of the missing signatures for cdw formation .",
    "pioneering studies @xcite had observed in angle integrated photoemission of certain quasi-1d materials one of the characteristic features expected of ll behavior , that the angle integrated single particle spectrum approaches  as a power law .",
    "these studies suffered from some ambiguity because the materials studied all manifested low t cdw formation and cdw fluctuations at higher t can in principle cause pseudogap behavior @xcite that might mimic the expected ll behavior .",
    "thus lipb was conceived @xcite as a non - cdw quasi-1d paradigm for studying ll behavior .",
    "it was also envisioned that arpes experiments could distinguish features of the single particle spectral function that are unique to ll behavior .",
    "a series of arpes studies dating from 1999 @xcite has born out this motivation . this section gives a guide to the key results of these various past arpes studies and points out two other measurements using different techniques that have added very importantly to the case for ll behavior .",
    "sections 4 and 5 present new photoemission data and a new phenomenological analysis of arpes data , respectively .",
    "arpes measures the single particle spectral function . for the paradigm one band tomonaga - luttinger ( tl )",
    "model @xcite the spectral function @xcite shows three characteristic signatures of ll behavior .",
    "the arpes measurements described below have demonstrated all three of these signatures .",
    "first , as already mentioned , the momentum(k)-summed spectrum approaches  as a power law characterized by an anomalous exponent .",
    "second , the k - resolved single particle lineshape is composed of two features , a holon peak with a leading spinon edge , the two dispersing with different velocities , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "this lineshape signifies the absence of quasi - particles and the fractionalization of the electron into density fluctuation modes of charge ( holon ) and spin ( spinon ) .",
    "third , the tl - model is quantum critical ( qc ) .",
    "qc systems display scale invariance , i.e. at t=0 k and for large distances and long times , the correlation functions lack a characteristic scale and take the simplest possible scale - free , functional form , a power law . departures from t=0",
    "k satisfy simple scaling laws @xcite with t the only scale . for the case of a spin rotationally invariant",
    "interaction the tl - model spectral function @xcite explicitly obeys the ideal scaling form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a universal scaling function , @xmath17 is measured from the fermi momentum @xmath18 , @xmath19 is measured from the fermi energy @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a constant with units of velocity . within the one band tl - model the t - scaling exponent @xmath22",
    "is then also determined by a scaling relation to be @xmath23 .",
    "the initial arpes studies @xcite were performed at relatively high temperatures of 200k to 300k to avoid any influence of the putative cdw transition at @xmath24 but the tl - model theoretical lineshapes then available @xcite for comparison @xcite to the arpes data were for t=0 k. over time the quality of the spectra improved and nonzero - t theory lineshapes @xcite became available .",
    "the latter were particularly important because including the effect of temperature changed the parameters deduced from the t=0 k comparison such as to improve the internal consistency of the description .",
    "it was found thereby  @xcite that the high t arpes spectra could be generally well described by the theory lineshapes for the measurement t and for an  value the same as determined directly from the angle integrated spectrum .",
    "these results can be seen in figs . 7 and 8 of ref .",
    "@xcite and figs .",
    "4,5 and 6 of ref .",
    "fig .  7 of ref .",
    "@xcite sketches the bands and shows arpes data for t=250 k. fig .",
    "8 of ref .",
    "@xcite compares the data to theoretical lineshapes calculated for t=250 k , for = 0.9 and for a range of values of @xmath25 .",
    "the lineshapes include the experimental broadening in k and @xmath19 .",
    "the choice of @xmath25=2 gives the best agreement with the data .",
    "fig . 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows a similar comparison of the data to theory for a range of values of   and one can see that = 0.9 gives the best agreement for the rate of falloff of the holon peak intensity as k approaches .",
    "fig . 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite is interesting for showing explicitly that k - integration of arpes data for a fermi liquid material yields a fermi edge whereas one obtains a power law at  for lipb .",
    "8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( same as fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) makes an important point concerning the arpes lineshapes . for",
    "@xmath26 0.5 , as is the case for lipb , the spinon feature of the lineshape is an edge singularity rather than a peak singularity . including also the broadening due to temperature and experimental resolutions yields a lineshape which at first glance does not have two distinct features and",
    "so could arouse skepticism as to the claim of observing spin - charge separation .",
    "nonetheless the various panels of the figure make it clear that the two features are indeed present and are still very visible because the spinon edge disperses at a rate that differs from that of the holon peak , controlled by varying @xmath25 .",
    "thus these lineshapes are quite unique , are characteristic of ll behavior , and are much different from the usual dispersing peaks seen in arpes .",
    "two other important findings for the arpes lineshapes of lipb are that the same spectra are obtained @xcite for samples made using each of the two main crystal growth techniques and that , within experimental resolutions , the same spectra are obtained when measured @xcite at a photon energy = 500ev as when measured with the lower photon energies  between 20 ev and 30 ev that were used for all the other arpes summarized here .",
    "the significance of the former is that it dispels the possibility of sample growth method being the origin of an early arpes report @xcite of fermi liquid lineshapes for t above t@xmath5 and of an 80 mev gap for t below t@xmath5 .",
    "this anomalous finding was disputed @xcite and since then has never been replicated .",
    "the significance of the latter is that the higher photon energy spectra are more bulk sensitive and the agreement of the spectra is consistent with the likelihood based on the crystal structure that the quasi-1d chains lie two layers below the cleavage plane and are hence well protected from surface effects , the same situation that has made arpes relevant to the bulk properties of many superconducting cuprate materials .    scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) @xcite has made an important contribution to the case for ll behavior .",
    "this work is notable for its t - range from 55 k down to 5 k , only slightly above t@xmath4 .",
    "the experimental resolution deduced from the sts spectra is 9 mev , essentially the same as the gap value implied by a mean field transition at t@xmath5 .",
    "sts also observes a power law density of states at , although the values of  @xmath6  0.6 are smaller than those measured in the high temperature arpes .",
    "no change was detected in the t - range of the resistivity upturn , consistent with the lack of a gap found in optical spectroscopy .",
    "as with arpes it is likely that the quasi-1d chains being probed in this surface sensitive spectroscopy are protected from surface effects by lying well below the cleavage plane .",
    "photoemission measurements extended to lower temperatures have continued to support ll physics , but have also revealed interesting disagreements with tl - model predictions .",
    "lineshapes from angle integrated arpes data from 300 k down to 30 k are very well fitted by tl - lineshapes but only if  is t - dependent @xcite .",
    "the t - dependence of  nicely connects the high t value of @xmath6 0.9 to the low t - value of @xmath6 0.6 found in sts . as with sts",
    "there is no evidence of the resistivity upturn .",
    "however , the fact that  is t - dependent is clearly outside the one band tl - model . a microscopic theory offered in ref .",

    "[ fig2](a ) to show the dispersing holon peak and spinon edge approaching @xmath20 .",
    "the need to measure for multiple t values within the lifetime of the sample necessitated noticeably poorer statistics for these spectra than for the spectra ( cited above @xcite ) that were compared in detail to the tl theory lineshapes .",
    "but apart from the poorer statistics the general features of the spectra are the same .    the t - dependent spectra were tested for qc - behavior as follows . if the general scaling form of the spectral function holds , then @xmath30 is independent of t if k is chosen for each t so that @xmath31 does not change , i.e. @xmath32 ( the @xmath18 spectra ) or @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath18 spectra were normalized to one another by matching the leading edges ( 0.25 to 0.4 ev ) of the b band peak , which lies relatively far from @xmath20 and has no apparent t dependence .",
    "[ fig2](c ) shows the normalized spectra vertically offset for clarity .",
    "the spectral intensitives at @xmath20 were then matched with a multiplicative t - dependent factor whose inverse has a power law dependence from which @xmath22 can be deduced as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the deviations between the data and the power law fit have no systematic pattern and are consistent with the effects of the noise in the spectra ( see fig . [ fig2](b ) ) giving uncertainty to the normalization process leading to fig . [ fig2](c ) .",

    "in addition to the lack of scaling of the holon peaks , one sees from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) that @xmath22 has a value that is essentially  rather than the value (  - 1 ) that would be expected from the tl model @xcite .",

    "solid lines through the data indicate line - fits of the spectra using the same tl - model as for the als k - integrated spectrum .",
    "the theoretical spectrum was broadened by the experimental energy resolution of 5mev which was determined from the gold spectrum .",

    "[ fig4 ] one sees the normalized residuals of the fits .",
    "the numbers next to the curves indicate how much the curves were shifted in the vertical direction for improved clarity of presentation .",
    "comparison of the residuals again shows clearly the poorer statistics of the osaka lipb data . both the t=4 k and the t=30k spectra show a deviation from the tl - lineshape at around 5 mev binding energy",
    "this deviation is larger for t=4 k than for t=30 k. since the resolution of 5 mev is better here than in the sts experiment it is logically possible that such a feature could have escaped detection in the sts spectrum . but a skeptic might point out that because it appears also in the 30k spectrum it does not correlate directly with the t - dependent transport properties .",
    "a skeptic might also claim a hint of this feature even in the gold spectrum residual .",
    "thus the question of whether this deviation is real or is due a small systematic error , i.e. not perfectly linear behavior of the detector or a contribution from the sample holder because the photon spot is large , or is simply the result of insufficient acquisition time to obtain better statistics , can not be absolutely answered .",
    "we present the spectra as a further confirmation of the overall large energy scale power law behavior and regard them as ambiguous on the possibility of structure at the 5 mev energy scale of the resolution .",
    "we take it as significant that all the new lipb data sets presented here give essentially the same   values @xmath6 0.65 to 0.7 .",
    "this is very much consistent with the range of values found in sts and perhaps consistent with a slight low t upturn of  found previously , as shown in fig .",

    "@xcite show that  is a qc system , but with important differences relative to expectations from the one - band tl - model , specifically in the exponent of the temperature prefactor and in the lack of the full sharpening predicted for decreasing t , which is part of the non - scaling of the holon peaks .",
    "these differences can be partially described by a phenomenological momentum broadening of the tl spectral function , but the required broadening greatly exceeds the experimental momentum resolution , as discussed below .",
    "the fact that the experimental scaling prefactor is @xmath46 rather than @xmath47 is a basic motivation to try an integration of the theoretical tl spectral function because that will draw a factor of t outside the integral . convolving the theoretical spectral function ( for which @xmath22 = (  - 1 ) ) with a momentum window function @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a t - independent width , and using the change of variables @xmath50 ( recall that @xmath21 is a constant with units of velocity ) , gives a_test(k , , t ) = t^ _ -^ ( ) ( - , ) d [ new_scaling ] a constant factor of 1/@xmath21 has been drawn into a redefined @xmath16 . @xmath51 has the @xmath52 prefactor observed experimentally but the rest of the expression is no longer a universal function of @xmath53 because t also enters in the form @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "there is generally good agreement in these comparisons until reaching the binding energy at which the higher lying bands begin to contribute intensity in the experimental spectra . from the spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and taking account of the width of band b this energy is 0.1 ev to 0.12 ev . for k - values away from  the binding energy of band b increases and so the deviation also moves to higher binding energies , nearly 0.2 ev . in spite of this agreement , it is important to point out that this phenomenology does not produce the t - dependence of   that is measured from t - dependent k - integrated spectra .",
    "in fact it works only for k - values rather near to   whereas a much larger range of k contributes to the k - integrated spectrum that determines .",
    "thus the phenomenology is not a substitute for a satisfactory microscopic model .    what is the meaning of this phenomenology ?",
    "the simplest possibility is of course that the momentum is indeed broadened .",
    "one could argue that the qc scaling predicted in the tl model is being observed except for being modified by the experimental resolution .",
    "however , the value of p@xmath58 is 5 times larger than the instrumental @xmath17 resolution , computed from the instrumental angle resolution as 0.013 @xmath43 .",
    "such a large extra broadening would have to be ascribed to sample surface quality .",
    "for example our relatively large spot size might be illuminating regions with slightly different orientations on the sample surface .",
    "the size of the discrepancy makes this interpretation more difficult to defend , but nonetheless the phenomenology shows that the issue of finite momentum resolution is very important .",
    "arpes scaling data might evolve with progress in sample growth and surface preparation techniques .",
    "another possibility is that the phenomenology tries to catch some of the intrinsic physics .",
    "for example it is clear from the t - dependence of   that the one band tl model is missing interactions of importance and we know from band theory and the arpes data that there are two bands crossing , associated with the two chains per unit cell .",
    "perhaps the phenomenology can be a guide for future theory .",
    "it would be very desirable to test the data against the spectral function for a two band tl model if it were available .",
    "the combination of data from arpes and sts along with the wiedeman - franz law violation cited above firmly establish generic signatures of ll physics in lipb for t at least down to t@xmath5 .",
    "how does the system achieve the 3d character that must obtain in the sc state ?",
    "at this point it is not possible to make a unified interpretation of all the relevant data .",
    "one can only speculate in a general way , guided by current 1d theory .",
    "recent discussions @xcite focus on the idea that the crossover to 3d occurs before t@xmath4 is reached , either that the resistivity rise is due to cdw formation @xcite , which is certainly of a 3d nature , or that a cdw does not occur @xcite and that crossover is more subtle in the resistivity data @xcite and in the mechanism whereby it occurs @xcite . here",
    "we speculate that 1d physics may be more robust , with crossover to 3d occurring only with the transition to sc , i.e. that above t@xmath4 there is non fermi liquid behavior rooted somehow in 1d with no single particle gap or density wave . in this connection",
    "one can take note of recent arguments @xcite for unconventional sc , possibly spin - triplet , based on the finding that the critical field is much larger than the pauli limit .    because the 1d physics of lipb appears to lie outside standard 1d theory @xcite we can only try to identify generic possibilities that may be robust for this line of thinking . looking first to single particle spectroscopy ,",
    "the power laws observed for temperatures only slightly above t@xmath4 in the sts and arpes data with 12 mev resolution are an initial temptation to consider this hypothesis .",
    "as discussed in section 4 , the 4 k angle integrated spectra are ambiguious on the possibility of spectral structure on a lower energy scale of the 5 mev resolution , but we note that even this energy scale corresponds to a temperature of 58 k , much higher than the t of the measurement or the t@xmath5 of the resisitivity upturn .",
    "the energy scale can perhaps be pushed lower by the 6 k optical spectroscopy @xcite performed down to 1 mev , corresponding to 11.6 k. this work found no single particle gap and no change associated with the resistivity upturn but did employ a drude description of the infrared data . a more recent study @xcite , albeit a measurement down to t=10 k and with a lower energy limit of 6 mev , also found no gap but in addition showed that the infrared behavior is actually non - drude . taken together",
    "these two studies suggest no single particle gap and non - fermi liquid behavior down to an energy scale of 1 mev , but definitive low temperature spectroscopic measurements probing to energy scales well below 1 mev are clearly needed .    the resistivity upturn , with the possibility of a gap less than 1 mev , as obtained in ref .  @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , is the primary transport evidence suggesting crossover due to a small single particle gap .",
    "however the highly novel gap function and the t - independent constant dc magnetic susceptibility measured down to 2 k are cause to consider an alternative description of the upturn .",
    "power laws are characteristic features of the qc nature of ll physics .",
    "indeed a power law is expected for the resistivity of a ll system .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows that the data of ref .",
    "@xcite can be described by two power laws , one with positive exponent for the metallic part @xcite and one with negative exponent for the upturn .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows the t - dependent gap that results from recasting this fit as an arrhenius law .",
    "the gap so obtained is very similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and the difference is very likely due to the difficulty of accurately digitizing the upturn in the resistivity data . in this view",
    "the unusual gap function is the result of forcing an arrhenius description onto a power law . in particular",
    "one notes that at low t the gap must roll over and then actually decrease in order to map the very fast rising exponential onto the slower rising power law .",
    "such a two - power - law description of lipb resistivity was first put forth in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the two power laws were ascribed to two independent ll s , one for each of the two bands crossing with each having different values of  and quite different roles in the crossover physics .",
    "this interpretation neglects the coulomb interaction that couples the chains to give symmetric and antisymmetric holon and spinon modes , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite and applied to lipb in ref .",
    "an alternate ll interpretation for the power law upturn is the old proposal of anderson localization due to disorder , but put in the context of ll physics as a low t crossover of the sign of the resistivity power law exponent due to disorder @xcite .",
    "a great concern of early discussions @xcite was that disorder and localization could be incompatible with sc .",
    "but , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the increased sensitivity to disorder in 1d could make it possible for the energy scale of the disorder to be much less than t@xmath4 .",
    "as seems true of all hypotheses concerning the resistivity upturn , this one also leaves some aspects of the data unexplained , why the same t@xmath5 would be found for the resistivity along all three axes , why hydrostatic pressure suppresses the upturn ( and also enhances the sc ) @xcite , and why the upturn can be suppressed @xcite by a magnetic field . for these aspects of the data one sees the attraction of postulating a gap that can be affected by pressure or a magnetic field . whatever is the proper understanding of the upturn , a case",
    "can be made that by virtue of a power law dependence on t it signifies a continuation of 1d behavior rather than a loss .",
    "the highly directional nature of the magnetic field suppression of the upturn @xcite emphasizes the importance of the 1d character in this temperature range and in this connection one notes also the remarkable recent observation @xcite that for a non - superconducting crystal a sufficiently large magnetic field applied specifically along the 1d axis appeared to restore the sc with a transition temperature considerably higher than 1.9k .    to return to the theme of the opening paragraph of the paper ,",
    "the greatest issue to be confronted in any line of thinking that emphasizes 1d physics down to t@xmath4 for lipb is the role and the energy scale of @xmath3 .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) show that the fs is unsplit and straight to a greater extent than predicted in current lda calculations .",
    "if one accepts the current lack of evidence for a cdw , and that is the stance of this paper , then there is a need to understand why the good nesting of the fs does not result in a cdw having all the standard properties that are readily detected for cdws in related materials .",
    "whatever is the mechanism it would apply down to t@xmath4 . within present theory",
    "the situation is very difficult but perhaps not quite impossible .",
    "we now discuss three possibilities .    in a one band ll model",
    "it is well known that the easy route to avoiding crossover due to @xmath3 is a gap in the spinon mode .",
    "the gap energy must be overcome for single particle hopping between the chains , which renders @xmath3 to be irrelevant in the renormalization group sense @xcite . but",
    "pair hopping that is second order in @xmath3 remains relevant and can lead to sc @xcite . if the energy scale of the spin gap is greater than t@xmath4 there can be a transition directly from the spin - gapped ll ( a luther - emery liquid ) to a sc @xcite .",
    "such a gap in lipb would seem to be precluded by the t - independent dc magnetic susceptibility which has been measured down to 2 k @xcite .",
    "however , the two chain model with four modes , as mentioned in the preceding paragraph , has both a symmetric and an antisymmetric spin mode .",
    "the symmetric mode that is probed in the dc susceptibility can be ungapped for some parameter ranges of this model @xcite .",
    "one could think of the possibility of a gap in the antisymmetric spin mode that has not been probed in any transport measurement to date and is small enough to have escaped spectroscopic detection but is nonetheless larger than t@xmath4 .",
    "such a gap would also be a barrier against single particle hopping between the chains and so might render @xmath3 to be irrelevant .",
    "a second possibility is the so - called sliding luttinger liquid ( sll ) @xcite .",
    "this is a lattice model for an array of coupled chains and specifically includes a mechanism for suppressing a purely electronic cdw along the chains .",
    "the physical idea @xcite is that coulomb interactions between the chains lead to transverse incommensurate cdw fluctuations that modulate the charge density on the chains , and therefore the fermi wavevector and therefore the longitudinal cdw q - vector , which frustrates locking of the longitudinal cdw . in this special regime",
    "the t=0 ground state retains the ll properties of a single chain and is stable against @xmath3 , against cdw fluctuations and sc fluctuations .",
    "a spin gap is not required but of course aids the sll stability .",
    "but in any case the parameters of the model must be tuned to bring the system to be near such a transverse cdw instability , raising doubt as to whether the model could apply to any real material .",
    "for other parameter values the stable ground state is a cdw , a novel sc , or a femi liquid .",
    "in addition there are difficulties specific to its application to lipb .",
    "the model does not address the possibility of a thermal phase transition from the sll state to a sc .",
    "also , as t goes to zero for the sll state , the resistivity is predicted to become infinite transverse to the chains and to become zero parallel to the chains . for the transverse direction",
    "the resistivity upturn is then consistent with this prediction but for the parallel direction one must invoke some other mechanism such as disorder .",
    "but one must then explain why t@xmath5 is the same for all directions and one must take account of how the transverse interactions may change the effect of disorder @xcite .",
    "nonetheless the concept that the chain cdw can be suppressed by frustration arising from competition between parallel and transverse cdw fluctuations may be more robust than the details of the model calculations that have been done and so the sll remains interesting for lipb .    in the absence of a spin gap or a scenario like the sll , the only possibility for the line of thinking in this section would seem to be that the energy scale of @xmath3 is less than t@xmath4 . in that case there is presently no conclusive theory for or against direct crossover of ll behavior to sc .",
    "the question entails the interplay of the pair tunneling terms needed for sc and the extent to which coulomb interactions might suppress or enhance the pair tunneling .",
    "could the energy scale of @xmath3 be this small in lipb ?",
    "current lda calculations @xcite suggest values of @xmath3 @xmath6 30 mev that would preclude this possibility",
    ". however 1d fluctuations on the chains are known to produce a suppression of @xmath3 @xcite to an effective value @xmath3@xmath63/t)@xmath64 , where t is the interchain hopping . for t",
    "@xmath6 800 mev suggested by lda bands for lipb and the measured low t value of  @xmath6 0.6 , one obtains the very small effective hopping value of 0.22mev , essentially the same as t@xmath4 .",
    "although this estimate is terribly sensitive to the value of , which is not known with such great precision , nonetheless it shows that the effective hopping could be very greatly suppressed , consistent with the fs data in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .    to pursue this idea",
    "our current arpes research aims at quantifying the single particle inter - chain hopping and setting a more precise bound on the extent of warping and splitting of the fs through yet higher resolution measurements just above t@xmath4 .",
    "new lda calculations using the nmto method @xcite and downfolding can be used to characterize the @xmath3 hopping in greater detail @xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that the theory @xmath3 s can then be adjusted in a realistic way to describe the arpes data and that the adjustments required can be compared to expectations from 1d theory @xcite .",
