    "this paper presents a survey of several results obtained by the authors concerning existence , uniqueness and numerical simulation of measure solutions for the one - dimensional aggregation equation in the attractive case .",
    "this equation describes aggregation phenomena in a population of individuals interacting under a continuous potential @xmath0 . if @xmath1 denotes the density of individuals , its dynamics is modelled by a nonlocal nonlinear conservation equation",
    "@xmath2 this equation is complemented with the initial condition @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is a smooth given function which depends on the actual model under consideration .",
    "this model appears in many applications in physics and population dynamics .",
    "it is used for instance in the framework of granular media @xcite , in the description of crowd motion @xcite , and in the description of the collective motion of cells or bacteria @xcite , and the references therein . in many of these examples ,",
    "the potential @xmath5 has a singularity at the origin . due to this weak regularity ,",
    "finite time blow up of regular solutions occurs and has caught the attention of several authors @xcite .",
    "the context of weak measure solution is natural here , because of this blow up property as well as the conservative structure of the aggregation equation , which gives rise to a bound on the mass of measure solutions .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on these singular attractive potentials , sometimes called mild singular .",
    "more precisely , we introduce the following notion .",
    "[ pointypot ] the interaction potential @xmath5 is said to be an _ attractive pointy potential _ if it satisfies the following assumptions : @xmath6 \\mbox { and   } w \\mbox { is } \\lambda\\mbox{-concave for some } \\lambda\\geq 0 , \\mbox { i.e. } w(x)-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}x^2 \\mbox { is concave}.      \\end{array}\\ ] ]    depending upon the applications , the function @xmath7 may be linear ( @xmath8 ) or nonlinear . in what follows , we shall refer to the _ linear case _",
    "when @xmath9 and the potential @xmath5 satisfies .",
    "in the _ nonlinear case _ additional assumptions have to be made .",
    "first , to obtain an attractive model , @xmath7 has to be nondecreasing .",
    "this is related to the so - called one - sided lipschitz estimates , see section [ sec : nonlin ] below for details .",
    "therefore we consider the following set of assumptions on the velocity field : @xmath10 unfortunately , in this case , the class of admissible potentials has to be reduced , namely we are limited to potentials @xmath5 such that @xmath11 \\mbox{such that } w''= -\\delta_0 + w \\mbox { holds in the distributional sense}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the above assumptions include classical functions @xmath5 such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "as we shall see , each case deserves its own definition of the velocity .",
    "several authors have studied existence of global in time weak measure solution for the aggregation equation . in @xcite ,",
    "global existence of weak measure solutions in the linear case , that is for @xmath5 satisfying , in @xmath14 for any dimension @xmath15 has been obtained using the gradient flow structure of this problem .",
    "in fact , for the aggregation equation in the case @xmath9 , we can define the interaction energy by @xmath16 then a gradient flow solution @xmath17 in the wasserstein space is defined as a solution in the sense of distributions of the continuity equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the element of minimal norm in @xmath20 , which is the subdifferential of @xmath21 at the point @xmath17 , see @xcite for more details .",
    "such a solution is constructed by performing the jko scheme @xcite .",
    "however this approach can not be applied in the nonlinear case that is under assumptions - and there is , up to our knowledge , no numerical result based on this approach allowing to recover the dynamics of the solution after blow up .",
    "an alternative strategy has been proposed by the authors , which consists in interpreting as a conservative transport equation with velocity @xmath22 .",
    "since solutions blow up in finite time , eventually @xmath1 become measure - valued , and care has to be taken of the product @xmath23 : typically dirac masses may appear and the velocity becomes discontinuous precisely at their location . hence this requires the use of tools which have been developped for advection equations with discontinuous coefficients : pushforward by a generalized flow @xcite , or duality solutions @xcite .",
    "this paper will make use of the latter notion , which is recalled in the next section .",
    "the first application to the aggregation equation was done in the particular case of chemotaxis in @xcite .",
    "it has been extended later to more general aggregation equations in both the linear and nonlinear cases in @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of this method is that it is presently limited to one space dimension . in the linear multidimensional case ( as in @xcite ) ,",
    "the pushforward method has been successfully applied in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in all cases the definition of the velocity and of its product with the measure @xmath1 has to be very carefully treated , as it is a key ingredient to prove the uniqueness of solutions .",
    "numerical simulations of solutions to before the blow up time has been investigated in @xcite with a finite volume method but no convergence result has been obtained , and in @xcite thanks to a particle method .",
    "however , the dynamics of the solutions after the blow up time is not recovered in these works .",
    "then , in @xcite , a finite volume scheme of lax - friedrichs type has been proposed and analyzed .",
    "this scheme has been designed in order to recover the dynamics of the solution after blow up time . in this paper , we study another finite volume scheme , based on an upwind approach .",
    "as in @xcite , the convergence of the scheme is proved and numerical simulations showing different blow up profiles are proposed .    the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "the next section is devoted to the definition of duality solution to equation .",
    "we first recall useful results on duality solutions for transport equation",
    ". then the definition of duality solution for the problem at hand is defined in subsection [ sec22 ] .",
    "a particular attention is given to the definition of the flux and velocity in both sets of assumptions .",
    "section [ sec : lin ] is devoted to the proof of existence and uniqueness of weak measure solutions in the linear case ( @xmath9 and @xmath5 satisfying ) .",
    "the nonlinear case , that is assumptions - , is studied in section [ sec : nonlin ] .",
    "section [ sec : lin ] and [ sec : nonlin ] summarize the main results of the articles @xcite .",
    "finally the numerical resolution of the problem is proposed in section [ num ] .",
    "the convergence of an upwind - type finite volume scheme is obtained in theorem [ th : convmacro ] .",
    "numerical illustrations showing different behaviours of solutions after blow up for different choices of the interaction potential are provided in subsection [ sec : numsim ]",
