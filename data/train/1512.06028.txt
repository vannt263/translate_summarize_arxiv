    "a scalar resonance with a mass of around 125 gev was first discovered in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum and four - lepton channel at the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments .",
    "the scalar particle is identified as the higgs boson which is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) in the standard model ( sm ) .    with @xmath0 tev , atlas and cms",
    "recently report the first results from run 2 of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and both experiments show a moderate bump at around @xmath10 gev in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum , where atlas ( cms ) employs @xmath11 fb@xmath12 of data @xcite . with the narrow width approximation ,",
    "the atlas and cms experiments show that the local significances for the diphoton excess are @xmath13 and @xmath14 while the global significances are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the earlier search for diphoton resonances was performed by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite at @xmath17 tev . although atlas found nothing exotic events , cms indicated some excess at the diphoton invariant mass of around @xmath10 gev .",
    "combined with the earlier diphoton excess , the local ( global ) significance at the cms becomes @xmath18 .",
    "motivated by the intriguing diphoton excess , the resonance candidates are proposed  @xcite .    taking the cms combined results as an illustration ,",
    "if a resonance at @xmath10 gev exists , the cross section for the process @xmath19 should be around 3 - 10 fb , where @xmath20 denotes the unknown resonance .",
    "if we assume that the resonance is a scalar and its couplings to the sm fermions and gauge bosons are similar to the sm higgs , one can see that the production cross section times the branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath21 decay is @xmath22 fb at @xmath0 tev  @xcite .",
    "the diphoton production cross section is too small to explain the excess .",
    "therefore , if the resonance is a scalar boson , the main problem is that @xmath23 should be of order of @xmath24 when @xmath25 is around 1 pb .",
    "since the heavy scalar or pseudoscalar boson in an ordinary two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) can couple to the weak gauge bosons and/or the sm fermions at the tree level , it may be difficult to escape the problem of small @xmath23 . to avoid this small br",
    ", we propose that the new resonance candidate is a higgs singlet ( @xmath26 ) in which it does not couple to the gauge bosons and the sm fermions at the tree level . in order to produce this singlet by gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) process",
    ", we introduce new exotic quarks with masses of 1 tev to couple to the higgs singlet .",
    "the proposal is motivated from the loop induced effective interaction of the sm higgs coupling to gluons , expressed as @xcite : _ hgg = n_f h g^a _ g^a , [ eq : lggh ] where @xmath27 is the top - quark yukawa coupling , @xmath28 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm higgs , the mass of top quark is determined by @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the number of possible heavy quarks in the loop , and @xmath31 in the sm . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lggh ] ) , it can be seen that the @xmath32 production cross section by ggf process can be enhanced by the yukawa coupling and the number of heavy quarks . for illustration ,",
    "if we pretend @xmath33 , @xmath34 tev and @xmath35 gev , the @xmath32 production cross section can reach @xmath36 pb .",
    "that is , the production cross sector for the proposed higgs singlet can easily reach the level of pb when the number of new exotic quarks and yukawa coupling are taken properly . since the higgs singlet can only decay via the new quark loops in which @xmath37 is the dominant decay channel",
    "; therefore , the br for the @xmath26 decaying to diphoton can be naively estimated by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the sum of squared electric charges of new quarks inside loop and we take @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the example .",
    "clearly , the resulted @xmath42 can match with the measurements from the lhc run 2 .    in order to establish a model that obeys the sm gauge symmetry ,",
    "is anomaly free , possesses a scalar with a mass of around 750 gev , and naturally provides larger @xmath30 and yukawa couplings , we investigate the subject in the framework of vector - like quark ( vlq ) model with a heavy @xmath43 higgs singlet . the related studies with higgs singlet and/or vlqs for explaining the diphoton excess can be referred to  @xcite . from a fundamental theoretical perspective , which is for resolving hierarchy issue , matter - antimatter asymmetry , etc , the vlqs are predicted by the theories , such as little higgs models  @xcite , composite higgs models  @xcite , extra dimensions  @xcite , and nonminimal supersymmetric sm  @xcite .",
    "a higgs singlet can be also embedded in these models . for phenomenological study , we directly add the vlqs and a higgs singlet to the sm .    basically , there is no limit for the possible representations of vlqs . if we consider the vlqs those which can only mix with the sm up or down type quarks , the possible representations are singlet , doublet , and triplet  @xcite . to avoid introducing too many vlq states ,",
    "we adopt the vector - like triplet quarks ( vltqs ) in which each triplet has three new quarks . in the base of gauge eigenstates , the introduced higgs singlet only couples to vltqs .",
    "since the introduced vlqs have different isospins from the sm quarks , therefore , the higgs- and @xmath44-mediated flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) occur at the tree level . due to the new yukawa couplings to vlqs and the sm quarks , besides the sm higgs coupling to top - quark is modified , the sm higgs couplings to vlqs are also induced . the sm higgs production cross section and its decay to diphoton",
    "thus are changed .",
    "it is interesting to see the influence of the model on the higgs measurements and its implications at the lhc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the model and present the new scalar potential , new yukawa couplings , and new gauge couplings to the introduced vector - like quarks .",
    "we study the properties of higgs singlet and discuss its production and various decays in sec .",
    "iii . in the same section",
    ", we also investigate the implications of new effects on the sm higgs decay to diphoton , top fcncs , and collider signatures .",
    "we give the conclusion in sec .  iv .",
    "we extend the sm by including one real higgs singlet @xmath26 and two vltqs , where the representations of vltqs in @xmath45 gauge symmetry are chosen as @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "since the current higgs measurements give a strict bound on the mixing angle between @xmath26 and the sm higgs  @xcite , in order to suppress the mixing effect at the tree level , we impose a @xmath48 discrete symmetry to the @xmath26 field , that is , @xmath49 under the @xmath48 transformation .",
    "the scalar potential , obeyed the sm gauge symmetry and @xmath48 symmetry , is expressed as : @xmath50 the representation of sm higgs doublet is taken as : h= (    cc g^+ + ( v+ h + ig^0 )    ) , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are goldstone bosons , @xmath32 is the sm higgs field and @xmath53 is the vev of @xmath54 . the scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vhs ] ) can not develop a non - vanished vev for @xmath26 field when @xmath55 .",
    "thus , like the sm , @xmath56 and @xmath57 gev . due to the @xmath48 symmetry , @xmath32 and @xmath26 do not mix at the tree level and @xmath58 is the mass of @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the @xmath48 can be softly broken by the mass terms of vltqs .",
    "the gauge invariant yukawa couplings of vltqs to the sm quarks , the sm higgs doublet , and the new higgs singlet are written as : -l^y_vltq & = &    tr(|f_2l f_2r ) s + & + & m_f_1 tr(|f_1l f_1r ) + m_f_2 tr(|f_2l f_2r)+ h.c . , [ eq : yukawa ] where @xmath59 is the left - handed sm quark doublet and regarded as mass eigenstate before the vltqs are introduced , all flavor indices are hidden , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the @xmath62 vltq with hypercharge @xmath63 . to keep the dimension-4 operator terms , we require",
    "that @xmath64 carry the @xmath48 charge ; the representations of @xmath65 in @xmath43 are expressed by : f_1 = (    cc u_1/ & x + d_1 & -u_1/    ) ,   f_2 = (    cc d_2/ & u_2 + y & -d_2/    )",
    ". the electric charges of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath20 and @xmath68 are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 can mix with up ( down ) type sm quarks .",
    "the masses of vltqs do not originate from the electroweak symmetry breaking . due to the gauge symmetry ,",
    "the vltqs in the same multiplet state are degenerate and denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "since the mass terms of vltqs do not involve @xmath26 field and the associated operators are dimension-3 , therefore , the discrete @xmath48 is softly broken by @xmath75 terms .",
    "since the @xmath26 field is a @xmath43 singlet , it can not directly couple to weak gauge bosons ; however , the effective couplings to these gauge bosons can be induced through the vltq loops .",
    "thus , it is necessary to study the weak interactions of vltqs .",
    "we write the covariant derivative of @xmath76 as : d_= _ + i ( t^+ w^+_+t^- w^- _ ) + i ( t_3 - s^2_w q ) z_+ i e",
    "q a _ , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 stand for the gauge bosons in the sm , @xmath80 is the gauge coupling of @xmath43 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the weinberg angle , @xmath83 , and the charge operator @xmath84 with that @xmath68 is the hypercharge of particle . the generators of @xmath43 in triplet representation are set to be : t_1=    0 & 1 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 1 & 0 +    ,   t_2=    0 & -i & 0 + i & 0 & -i + 0 & i & 0 +    ,   t_3=    1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & -1 +    .",
    "accordingly , the gauge interactions of new quarks are summarized as : _ vff & = & -g + & - & , [ eq : vff ] where the alternative expressions for the vltqs are given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 and the associated charge operators are diag@xmath87 and diag@xmath88 . since the left - handed and right - handed vltqs have the same couplings to the gauge bosons , therefore , the vector - like quarks in eq .",

    "<S> . a resonant bump at a mass of around 750 gev in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum is indicated and the corresponding diphoton production cross section is around 3 - 10 fb . motivated by the lhc diphoton excess , we propose that the possible resonance candidate is a higgs singlet . to produce the higgs singlet via gluon - gluon fusion process , we embed the higgs singlet in the framework of vector - like triplet quark ( vltq ) model . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the higgs singlet decaying to diphoton final state is via vltq loops . using the enhanced number of new quarks and new yukawa couplings of the vltqs and higgs singlet </S>",
    "<S> , we successfully explain the diphoton production cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the width of the higgs singlet is below 1 gev , its production cross section can be of order of 1 pb at @xmath0 tev , and the branching ratio for it decaying to diphoton is around @xmath1 and is insensitive to the masses of vltqs and new yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong correlation between the higgs yukawa couplings to @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath4-@xmath5 ; the resulted branching ratio for @xmath6 can be @xmath7 when the constraint from @xmath8 oscillation is applied . with the constrained parameter values , </S>",
