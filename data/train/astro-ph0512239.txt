    "since the discovery of q0957 + 561 @xcite , about 80 gravitationally lensed quasars have been discovered @xcite .",
    "lensed quasars are not only intriguing phenomena but also have become indispensable astronomical tools , including probes of the cosmological parameters and the structure of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the abundance of gravitational lenses in a well - defined source sample can be used to constrain dark energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , the largest existing survey , the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contains only 22 lensed radio sources ( with a well - defined statistical sample of 13 lenses ) discovered from @xmath6 radio sources , which is still insufficient to place tight constraints on dark energy models . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should lead to a significantly larger lens sample for attacking the dark energy problem .",
    "sdss is expected to identify @xmath7 quasars spectroscopically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath8 quasars photometrically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which should lead to a sample of over @xmath9 lensed quasars given a standard lensing probability of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "indeed , 12 new lensed quasars have been discovered from the sdss quasars so far @xcite , in addition to recovering 5 previously known lensed quasars @xcite .",
    "we can presently construct a well - defined statistical sample of 16 lensed sdss quasars , but there remain many promising sdss lensed quasar candidates for which the necessary follow - up observations are incomplete .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the discovery of two more gravitationally lensed quasars , sdss  j080623.70 + 200631.9 ( sdss  j0806 + 2006 ) and sdss  j135306.35 + 113804.7 ( sdss  j1353 + 1138 ) .",
    "we present imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations with the university of hawaii 2.2-meter ( uh88 ) telescope , the w. m. keck observatory s keck i and ii telescopes , and the magellan consortium s landon clay 6.5-m ( lc6.5 m ) telescope .",
    "we model the systems to check that their geometries are consistent with the lensing hypothesis .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our lens candidate selections from the sdss data in  [ sec : sdss ] .",
    "the follow - up observations and mass modeling of sdss  j0806 + 2006 and sdss  j1353 + 1138 are presented in  [ sec:0806 ] and  [ sec:1353 ] , respectively .",
    "we finally present a summary and give a conclusion in  [ sec : conc ] . throughout the paper we assume a cosmological model with the matter density @xmath11 , cosmological constant @xmath12 , and hubble constant @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the sdss is conducting a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 10,000 square degrees of the sky approximately centered on the north galactic cap using the dedicated wide - field ( @xmath14 field of view ) 2.5-m telescope @xcite at the apache point observatory in new mexico , usa .",
    "photometric observations @xcite are made in five optical filters @xcite .",
    "after automated data processing by the photometric pipeline @xcite , quasar and galaxy candidates are selected by the spectroscopic target selection algorithms @xcite .",
    "spectra of these candidates are obtained according to the tiling algorithm of @xcite using a multi - fiber spectrograph covering 3800 to 9200 at a resolution of r@xmath15 .",
    "the data are very homogeneous , with an astrometric accuracy better than about @xmath16 rms per coordinate @xcite and photometric zeropoint errors less than about 0.03 magnitude over the entire survey area @xcite .",
    "the data have been released continuously to the public @xcite .",
    "we selected the two objects , sdss  j0806 + 2006 and sdss  j1353 + 1138 , as lensed quasar candidates from the sdss spectroscopic quasar sample with the same algorithm used for the discovery of most sdss lensed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "specifically , the algorithm uses the sdss image parameters dev_l , exp_l and star_l for the likelihood that a source can be modeled as a de vaucouleurs profile , an exponential disk or a point source to quantify the structure of each quasar .",
    "lensed quasars should be modeled poorly by all three profiles , so quasars with small values for all three likelihoods are good lens candidates ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the sdss @xmath17-band images of sdss  j0806 + 2006 and sdss  j1353 + 1138 are shown in figure  [ fig : field08061353 ] .",
    "both systems are clearly resolved , making them excellent lens candidates since their spectra are clearly those of @xmath18 quasars . for sdss  j0806 + 2006 , the total magnitudes ( within @xmath19 aperture radius ) of the system",
    "are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath17 , and @xmath28 , respectively . for sdss  j1353 + 1138",
    ", the total magnitudes ( @xmath29 , within @xmath30 aperture radius ) are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the redshifts of sdss  j0806 + 2006 and sdss  j1353 + 1138 measured from their sdss spectra are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . from the sdss spectra , with a fiber aperture of @xmath38 , we know that the components of the candidates can not have greatly dissimilar spectra .",
    "however , we can not resolve the spectra of the individual components .",
    "thus , while the sdss data are sufficient to identify these objects as lens candidates , additional observations are needed to confirm them as lensed quasars .",
    "deeper and higher resolution images are needed to confirm the existence of multiple quasar images and to search for the lens galaxies , and spatially resolved spectra are needed to confirm that the quasar images have identical redshifts .",
    "we present this evidence for sdss  j0806 + 2006 in  3 and for sdss  j1353 + 1138 in  4 .",
    "we obtained @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41-band images of sdss  j0806 + 2006 using the 8k mosaic ccd camera at the uh88 telescope , on 2004 december 16 .",
    "the pixel scale of the 8k mosaic ccd camera is 0235 @xmath42 .",
    "the exposure time was 360 sec for each band .",
    "the typical seeing in the exposures was @xmath43 , about a half of the typical seeing size of the sdss ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "bias - subtracted and flat - field corrected images are shown in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : uh88_0806 ] .",
    "we also obtained an @xmath45-band image using the quick infrared camera ( quirc ) of the uh88 telescope on 2005 february 21 and a @xmath46-band image using the near infrared camera ( nirc ; * ? ? ? * ) of the keck i telescope on 2005 april 24 .",
    "the pixel scale of quirc is @xmath47 @xmath42 , and that of the nirc is @xmath48 @xmath42 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath43 in the quirc observation , and it was @xmath49 in the nirc observation .",
    "the total exposure time was 720 sec and 900 sec for @xmath45-band imaging and @xmath46-band imaging , respectively .",
    "the @xmath45-band image is shown in figure  [ fig : uh88_0806 ] , and the @xmath46-band image is shown in figure  [ fig : keck_0806 ] .    all the images ( @xmath50 ) clearly show two stellar components ; we name these two stellar components a ( eastern component ) and b ( western component ) , with a being the brighter component . to determine if there are any extended objects in between the stellar components , we subtracted point spread functions ( psfs ) from the raw @xmath51 images , adopting a nearby star as a template for the psf .",
    "the results are shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : uh88_0806 ] ; there is clearly residual flux between components a and b in all four images .",
    "this object ( named g ) is quite red , with colors of @xmath52 and @xmath53 that are similar to those of an early - type galaxy at @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "such a redshift is consistent with the redshift of a absorption line system in the spectra of the quasars ( see  [ sec:0806spc ] ) and an estimate based on the faber - jackson relation ( see  [ sec:0806model ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that component g is the lens galaxy . in the higher resolution",
    "nirc @xmath46-band image ( left panel of figure  [ fig : keck_0806 ] ) , we can identify component g between components a and b even before psf subtraction .",
    "we fit this image using galfit @xcite to find that g is well - modeled by a de vaucouleurs profile of ellipticity @xmath55 and major axis position angle @xmath56 .",
    "the astrometry and photometry of components a , b and g are summarized in table [ tab:0806 ] .",
    "the optical images were calibrated using the standard star pg 0231 + 051 @xcite and the @xmath45-band image was calibrated using the standard star fs 21 @xcite .",
    "we lack a photometric standard stars for the nirc @xmath46-band image , thus the data were used only for astrometry and the flux ratio constraints in the lens models .",
    "when we fit the nirc @xmath46-band image using a model consisting of the two quasar images and the lens galaxy , we find a quasar flux ratio of 0.53 as compared to the mean flux ratio of 0.67 ( derived from fitting only the psf models ) for the optical bands that could be created by a modest amount of dust extinction or chromatic microlensing .",
    "we report the astrometry from using galfit to simultaneously fit components a , b and g in the nirc @xmath46-band image .",
    "the angular separation of components a and b is @xmath57 .",
    "a spectroscopic observation of sdss  j0806 + 2006 was conducted with the keck ii telescope on 2005 april 12 in @xmath58 seeing .",
    "we used the echellette mode of the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the mit - ll 2048@xmath594096 ccd camera .",
    "the spectral range was 3900 to 11,000 at a spectral resolution of @xmath60 ( r@xmath6127000 ) .",
    "the exposure time was 900 sec .",
    "the @xmath62-wide slit was oriented to observe components a and b simultaneously .",
    "the spectra of each component was extracted using the standard method ( summing the fluxes in a window around the position of each component and subtracting the sky using neighboring windows on either side of the trace ) .",
    "we show the binned spectra in figure [ fig : spec0806 ] .",
    "both spectra have the and emission lines at the same wavelength , with an estimated velocity difference of @xmath63  km s@xmath64 for the emission line .",
    "we summarize the redshifts calculated from these emission lines in table [ tab:0806em ] .",
    "in addition , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are also very similar .",
    "the ratio of the spectra , which is shown in figure [ fig : spec0806 ] , is almost constant ( @xmath65 ) for a wide range of wavelengths , and it is consistent with the mean flux ratio of the optical images ( 0.67 ) .",
    "note , however , that the emission line flux ratios appear to differ slightly from that of the continuum , suggesting that there is some microlensing of the continuum by the stars in the lens galaxy .",
    "in addition to the quasar emission lines , we found a strong absorption line system at @xmath66 in both spectra ( see the inset of figure [ fig : spec0806 ] ) .",
    "we also found h and k ( @xmath67  ) and absorption lines ( @xmath68  ) at @xmath66 in the spectra .",
    "the fact that the redshift of this absorption line system is close to the estimated redshift ( see  [ sec:0806img ] ) of the probable lens galaxy ( component g ) and that absorption lines are frequently associated with galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the absorption is due to the lens galaxy .",
    "if this is the case , the lens redshift should be @xmath69 ; we adopt this value for the mass models presented in the next subsection .      to explore the lensing hypothesis further , we modeled the system using the two standard mass models : a singular isothermal sphere with an external shear ( sis+shear ) model , and a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model .",
    "both models have eight parameters : the einstein radius @xmath70 , the shear @xmath71 or ellipticity @xmath72 and its position angle ( @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) , the position of the lens galaxy , and the position and flux of the source quasar .",
    "we have only eight constraints ( the positions of a , b and g , and the fluxes of a and b ) , so we should be able to fit the data perfectly .",
    "we should , however , be able to do so with sensible values for the shear or ellipticity of the models .",
    "we used the component positions from table  [ tab:0806 ] and the flux ratio of 0.53 derived from the galfit model of the nirc @xmath46-band image including the two stellar components and the lens galaxy .",
    "lensmodel _ @xcite to determine the model parameters , with the results summarized in table  [ table : model0806 ] .",
    "the required ellipticities of @xmath75 or @xmath76 are typical of other lensed systems and roughly consistent with that of the lens galaxy ( @xmath55 ) , but there is a significant misalignment between the position angle of the major axis of the models ( @xmath77 ) and that of the lens galaxy ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this might imply that the system is affected by a strong external perturbation @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are at least four galaxies within a 16@xmath79 radius of the lens ( named g14 , with the nearest galaxy only 4@xmath79 from the lens ; see table  [ tab:0806gal ] ) , so the position angle of the models may be a compromise between that of the lens galaxy and the shear induced by g1 .",
    "finally , these models predict that the time delay between the images is @xmath80days .",
    "we can estimate the redshift of the lens galaxy based on the faber - jackson relation @xcite . from the table  3 of @xcite",
    ", we estimate that the lens magnitude should be @xmath81 for @xmath2 , @xmath82 , and assuming @xmath83 .",
    "while this is somewhat brighter than the observed @xmath40-band magnitude of galaxy g ( @xmath84 ) , it is roughly consistent given the @xmath85  mag scatter @xcite .",
    "the rough agreement of this estimate further supports for a lens galaxy redshift of @xmath69 .",
    "we obtained @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41-band images of sdss  j1353 + 1138 using the 8k mosaic ccd camera of the uh88 telescope on 2004 may 25 in @xmath58 seeing .",
    "the exposure times were 120 sec for @xmath39 and 180 sec for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we also acquired an @xmath45-band image on the uh88 telescope using quirc on 2005 february 21 .",
    "the exposure time was 720 sec , and the seeing was @xmath43 .",
    "the images , shown in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : uh88_1353 ] , clearly show two stellar components , which we named a ( northern and brighter component ) and b ( southern component ) .",
    "although it is not obvious in the raw @xmath45-band image of figure [ fig : uh88_1353 ] , an extended object can be seen between components a and b even before the psf subtraction .",
    "we also obtained @xmath26 and @xmath17-band images using the magellan instant camera ( magic ) at the lc6.5 m telescope on 2005 april 15 .",
    "the pixel scale of magic is @xmath86 @xmath42 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath87 , and the exposure time was 360 sec for @xmath26-band and 480 sec for @xmath17-band .",
    "after subtracting psf models for the two stellar components , we clearly detect an extended red object positioned between them in all the residual images .",
    "these residual images are shown in figure [ fig : uh88_1353 ] and [ fig : mag_1353 ] for the uh88 and magellan data , respectively .",
    "we identify this extended object , which we denote as g , with the lens galaxy .",
    "we fit the @xmath17-band image using galfit to find that the lens galaxy is well - modeled with a de vaucouleurs profile of ellipticity @xmath88 and major axis position angle @xmath89 .",
    "in addition to component g , there is an additional object which we named component c near image a. it is most easily seen in the @xmath26-band image after subtracting components a and b ( see the middle panel of figure [ fig : mag_1353 ] ) , but it can also be seen at the same position in the @xmath17-band image",
    ".    there are four possible interpretations of component c. first , it could be a chance superposition of a foreground star .",
    "it is well fit by the psf ( see the bottom panels of figure [ fig : mag_1353 ] ) , and our lens models require only components a , b and g to reproduce the system with reasonable parameter values ( see [ sec:1353model ] ) .",
    "second , it could be an object related to the lens galaxy .",
    "however , lens models with significant extra mass at the position of component c generally fit the data very badly .",
    "third , it could be a third image of the quasar .",
    "this seems unlikely since its colors are very different from components a and b ( see table [ tab:1353 ] ) .",
    "moreover , identifying it as a quasar image makes little sense as a lens geometry since it is in the wrong place to be a central , odd image ( which should lie between components b and g ) or to be part of a four - image system in which one of the a / b / c components is an unresolved image pair .",
    "fourth , it could be emission from the host galaxy of the source quasar .",
    "probably only the first possibility is permitted , although we can not completely exclude the other possibilities .",
    "we summarize astrometry and photometry of components a , b , c and g in table [ tab:1353 ] .",
    "the optical images were calibrated using the standard stars pg 1528 + 062 @xcite and sa 107 - 351 @xcite , and the @xmath45-band image was calibrated using the standard star fs 21 @xcite",
    ". the flux ratio of components a and b changes significantly with wavelength , from a mean flux ratio in the optical of @xmath90 to an @xmath45-band flux ratio of 0.54 .",
    "the angular separation of components a and b is @xmath91 .",
    "we used esi on the keck ii telescope to obtain spectra of the two components of sdss  j1353 + 1138 on 2005 april 12 .",
    "the instrumental set up was the same as in  [ sec:0806spc ] and we used an exposure time of 600  sec .",
    "the binned spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spec1353 ] .",
    "both components have and emission lines at identical wavelengths , with a velocity difference of only @xmath92  km s@xmath64 for the emission line .",
    "we summarize the redshifts derived from the emission lines in table [ tab:1353em ] .",
    "the flux ratio of the spectra is nearly constant ( @xmath93 ) and consistent with that in the optical images ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "there is , however , a slight increase in the ratio redwards of about 5300  that may be due to contamination of the spectrum of component b by emission from the lens galaxy . assuming this feature is due to the 4000 break of the lens galaxy",
    ", it implies a lens redshift of @xmath95 .",
    "since the colors of the lens galaxy of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are roughly consistent with those of an early - type galaxy at @xmath99 @xcite , we adopt @xmath100 for mass modeling .",
    "the quasar spectra also contain strong absorption line systems at @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , with their absorption lines .",
    "these are unlikely to be associated with the lens galaxy , given the large difference from the lens redshift estimated from the colors , and also given the fact that many ( unlensed ) quasars show absorption .",
    "we note that an absorption line due to a @xmath104 lens is undetectable in our spectra because it would lie beyond the atmospheric cutoff .",
    "we modeled sdss  j1353 + 1138 in the same way as in  [ sec:0806model ] .",
    "the positions of the quasars and lens galaxy are taken from table [ table : model1353 ] ( neglecting component c ) . for the flux ratio of components a and b , we adopt @xmath105 , which was derived from the galfit model of the magic @xmath17-band image .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table : model1353 ] .",
    "the derived shear and ellipticity of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , are again typical for a lensed quasar system .",
    "the derived ellipticity ( 0.15 ) appears to be significantly smaller than the ellipticity of the observed light profile ( @xmath108 ) , but this difference is commonly seen in the lensed quasar systems @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to the disagreement of the ellipticity , there is a significant misalignment between the position angle of the models ( @xmath109 ) and that of the lens galaxy ( @xmath89 ) . while this might be due to external perturbations , there are no nearby galaxies that can easily explain the misalignment",
    ". it could be due to component c , but we find that simple tests of lens models with mass located at the position of component c generally fail to fit the data . the time delay between a and b is predicted to be @xmath110days , assuming the lens redshift of @xmath100 .    as in ",
    "[ sec:0806model ] we also estimated the lens redshift based on the faber - jackson relation .",
    "again we used table  3 of @xcite , @xmath3 , and @xmath111 to estimate that the lens magnitude should be @xmath112 , assuming @xmath113 .",
    "this estimate is in rough agreement with the observed @xmath40-band magnitude of galaxy g ( @xmath114 ) , again supporting for a lens redshift of @xmath115 .",
    "we report the discovery of two doubly - imaged quasar lenses , sdss  j0806 + 2006 and sdss  1353 + 1138 . both were selected from the sdss",
    "spectroscopic quasar sample as lensed quasar candidates and confirmed in subsequent imaging and spectroscopic observations .",
    "sdss  j0806 + 2006 consists of two @xmath0 quasar images separated by @xmath2 lensed by a galaxy at @xmath116 .",
    "the lens galaxy is closer to the fainter image as expected , and its redshift , as suggested by its magnitude , colors , and the presence of a absorption feature , is @xmath117 .",
    "several nearby galaxies may perturb this system and indicate that the lens galaxy is part of a small group .",
