    "one of the most interesting service disciplines in queueing theory is that of processor sharing ( ps ) . here",

    "one of the main measures of performance is a given ( also called tagged ) customer s sojourn time distribution , conditioned on the number of other customers in the system upon his arrival .",

    "we can remove the conditioning to get @xmath8 since @xmath5 follows a geometric distribution .    in @xcite ,",
    "coffman , muntz , and trotter derived an expression for the laplace transform of the sojourn time distribution , conditioned on both the number seen by an arrival and the amount of service required by the arriving customer , in the @xmath0-ps model .",

    "thus , ( [ s2_th2_4(1)phi ] ) , ( [ s2_th2_4(2)phi ] ) and ( [ s2_th2_4(3)phi ] ) are obtained from the corresponding region with @xmath554 .",
    "the function @xmath555 can not be determined completely from ( [ s6_4_pdedelta ] ) , but we find that it must have the form @xmath556 we shall obtain the behaviors of @xmath557 as @xmath311 and @xmath558 below .",
    "thus , by setting @xmath482 , @xmath9 has the following asymptotic approximation : @xmath559 where @xmath68 has three different forms , but passes smoothly through the two transition curves in figure 1 .    for the scale @xmath85 and @xmath22",
    ", we assume that @xmath9 has the form @xmath560 using the above expansion in ( [ s2_recu1 ] ) , we obtain the difference equation @xmath561 using generating functions we can express @xmath562 in terms of @xmath563 , as @xmath564 then , by setting @xmath482 , we have for @xmath85 @xmath565    in ( [ s6_3_pnt ] ) , ( [ s6_4_pnt ] ) and ( [ s6_5_pnt ] ) , the functions @xmath566 , @xmath567 and @xmath568 can not be completely determined by the perturbation method . but by examing the matching between the scales , we can find their structure in the matching regions .",
    "we first consider the matching region between the scales @xmath60 and @xmath281 . if let @xmath252 in ( [ s6_3_pnt ] ) , we have @xmath569 and we assume that @xmath570 has the form @xmath571 if let @xmath572 in ( [ s6_4_pnt ] ) in the first region where @xmath573 , we can use ( [ s4_matching34 ] ) and obtain @xmath574.\\ ] ] then we assume that @xmath557 has an algebraic behavior as @xmath558 , in the form @xmath575 if these two scales are to match in an intermediate limit where @xmath252 and @xmath334 , it follows that @xmath576 thus , we conclude that @xmath577 , @xmath578 and @xmath579 .",
    "we also conclude that @xmath580.\\ ] ]    we now consider the matching region between the scales @xmath281 and @xmath581 .",
    "if we let @xmath311 in ( [ s6_4_pnt ] ) in the third region where @xmath582 , we have ( [ s4_matching45_c ] ) , which implies that @xmath583 we then assume that @xmath557 has the form @xmath584 we let @xmath585 in ( [ s6_5_pnt ] ) and use ( [ s4_matching45_int ] ) , and also assume the following form for @xmath586 @xmath587 note that the exponential factor is indicated by the behavior of @xmath90 as @xmath311 .",
    "then the matching holds provided that @xmath588 thus , we conclude that @xmath589 @xmath590 , @xmath591 and @xmath592    we have thus shown that much , but certainly not all , of the asymptotic structure of @xmath9 in theorem 2.2 can be obtained by perturbation methods , which make no recourse to the exact solutions in theorem 2.1 and ( [ s2_polla ] ) .",
    "we can use this method to obtain the full asymptotic series for the scales for cases 1 and 2 in theorem 2.2 .",
    "for the scales in cases 3 , 4 and 5 we can obtain partial information only .",
    "specifically , we can get ( [ s2_th2_3 ] ) only up to the unknown function @xmath570 , for which we can infer the behavior as @xmath248 and as @xmath252 ( up to the constant @xmath593 ) .",
    "of course this function was fully determined by the saddle point method , as given in ( [ s2_th2_3_k ] ) . from ( [ s2_th2_3_k ] )",
    "we can easily show that the behaviors as @xmath248 and as @xmath252 were correctly predicted by the matching arguments .",
    "similarly , the perturbation method yielded the function @xmath68 in ( [ s2_th2_4 ] ) completely , for all 3 ranges of @xmath69 .",
    "but , only partial information could be obtained about @xmath594 .",
    "specifically , we obtained the behavior of @xmath567 as @xmath334 ( up to the constant @xmath595 ) and as @xmath311 ( up to the constant @xmath596 ) . for @xmath22 with @xmath85 we could determine the expansion of @xmath9 up to the constant @xmath597 , which is expressible in terms of @xmath596 .",
    "for the scale @xmath281 the perturbation method led to a nice geometric interpretation of the 3 sub - cases in item 4 of the theorem 2.2 .",
    "next we very briefly discuss the heavy traffic case via perturbation expansions .",
    "we set @xmath104 with @xmath344 , and first consider @xmath356 and @xmath598 , expanding @xmath9 as follows : @xmath599 using ( [ s6_ht_3_p ] ) in ( [ s2_recu1 ] ) we obtain to leading order @xmath600 so that @xmath601 to obtain @xmath602 , we need to solve @xmath603 with the initial condition @xmath604 , and hence @xmath605e^{-\\tau/\\xi}.\\ ] ] using ( [ s6_ht_3_p0 ] ) and ( [ s6_ht_3_p1 ] ) in ( [ s6_ht_3_p ] ) leads to ( [ s2_th3_3 ] ) .",
    "this result is valid for @xmath484 with @xmath606 .",
    "next , we consider the scale @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we note that from ( [ s6_4_pnt ] ) , by setting @xmath104 , we have @xmath607 this leads us to seek the asymptotic expression of @xmath9 in the form @xmath608\\big\\}.\\ ] ] using ( [ s6_ht_4_assume ] ) in ( [ s2_recu1 ] ) , we have the following pde : @xmath609 this pde is essentially the same as that in ( [ s6_4_pde1 ] ) .",
    "however , now we impose the initial condition @xmath610 , which is necessary if the expansion in ( [ s6_ht_4_assume ] ) is to match to ( [ s6_ht_3_p0 ] ) as @xmath611 .",
    "thus we must solve ( [ s6_ht_4_pde ] ) using characteristic curves ( rays ) that start from @xmath612 , with @xmath613 .",
    "we again find that the geometry of the rays naturally divides the @xmath120 plane into 3 parts ( see figure 2 ) . in figure 2 the rays in region",
    "( 1 ) always have @xmath614 and these never hit @xmath615 ( the scaled time axis ) .",
    "regions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are filled by rays that do hit @xmath615 , and region ( 2 ) has @xmath614 along a ray , while region ( 3 ) has @xmath616 .",
    "the dashed curve is ( [ s5_4_curve1 ] ) , which is a ray corresponding to @xmath617 in ( [ s2_th3_4(1)a ] ) , that separates regions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "letting @xmath618 in ( [ s2_th3_4(2)b ] ) , we obtain ( [ s5_4_curve2 ] ) , which is not a ray , and is shown by the dotted curve , which also separates regions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "expressions ( [ s2_th3_4(1)phi ] ) , ( [ s2_th3_4(2)phi ] ) and ( [ s2_th3_4(3)phi ] ) are obtained in the corresponding regions by solving ( [ s6_ht_4_pde ] ) .",
