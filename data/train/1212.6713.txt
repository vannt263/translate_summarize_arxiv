    "main sequence stars with mass roughly below 1.5 solar mass ( @xmath7 hereafter ) posses a surface convective layer , which is the main origin of x - ray and wind activities from such solar - type stars ; magnetic fields are generated in a surface convective layer by dynamo mechanisms ( e.g. , choudhuri et al.1995 ; brun et al.2004 ; hotta et al.2012 ) and turbulent motions associated with the magnetoconvection are the source to drive flares and outflows .",
    "such magnetic activities are themselves interesting phenomena with fruitful physics , and in addition they may also affect planetary circumstances around central stars .",
    "various researches have been carried out recently from this viewpoint ( e.g. , terada et al.2009 ; sterenborg et al.2011 ; lammer et al.2012 ) .",
    "young sun - like stars are very active : the observed x - ray flux is up to @xmath8 times larger than the present solar level @xcite , and the x - ray temperature is also higher @xcite .",
    "there is an observational implication that a young star could have a very thick chromosphere extending to 10 - 20% of the stellar radius @xcite , which is in contrast to the thin chromosphere of the present sun with width of 0.1 - 1% of the solar radius ( @xmath9 hereafter ) .",
    "these observations show that in young sun - like stars the atmospheric materials are lifted up to higher altitudes and heated up more intensely in upper regions .",
    "this is probably related to the strong magnetic fields with an order of kg or even larger observed in young main sequence stars ( donati & collier cameron 1997 ; saar & brandenburg 1999 ; saar 2001 ; see also donati & landstreet 2009 for recent review ) , which are much stronger than the average strength of 1 - 10 g of the present - day sun . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass loss rates derived from the comparison between observations of near - by stars with the spectral types of g , k , m and spherical symmetric steady - state hydrodynamical simulations show a different trend ( wood et al.2002 ; 2005 ) ; after an increase of the mass loss rate with the increasing x - ray flux , it saturates at @xmath10 100 times of the current solar level and even drops in some very active stars .",
    "an explanation of the saturation is due to the change of the magnetic topology .",
    "it is expected that the surface area of active stars is mostly covered by closed magnetic structure as a result of the strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "then , the atmospheric gas is confined in closed loops rather than streaming out from open flux tubes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative and additional mechanism for the saturation .",
    "we focus on the dynamics in open magnetic flux tubes and show by numerical simulations that the saturation of the stellar winds could take place in open flux tube regions because of an enhancement of the radiative losses in active stars .",
    "the construction of the paper is as follows : after briefly introducing the setup of the mhd simulations in  [ sec : smst ] , we summarize in  [ sec : engfm ] basic formulations for the analysis of the wind energetics in the later sections . ",
    "[ sec : restav ] presents the main results of the simulated stellar winds . in  [ sec : dis ] we extensively discuss our results in light of observations of stellar winds (  [ sec : cmpobs ] ) and chromospheres (  [ sec : evchr ] ) .",

    "( 70mm,)kgpatch1.ps    we extend our one dimensional ( 1d ) magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulation code originally developed for the present - day solar wind in suzuki & inutsuka ( 2005 ; 2006 ) to young active sun - like stars with strong magnetic fields and large velocity fluctuations at the photosphere (  [ sec : inpp ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we focus on main sequence stars and fix the basic stellar parameters on those of the present - day sun , mass , @xmath11 , radius , @xmath12 and effective temperature , @xmath13 k. compared to the current sun , the radius of a 1@xmath7 star is slightly smaller by @xmath14 % and the effective temperature also slightly lower within @xmath15 k at early epochs of the main sequence @xcite . however , we use the same radius and effective temperature in our simulations for both active and inactive stars because we would like to study responses of the stellar winds to the changes of the magnetic fields and velocity fluctuations at the photosphere .",
    "we dynamically solve ideal mhd equations with radiative cooling and thermal conduction in super - radially expanding flux tubes from the photosphere with density , @xmath16 g @xmath17 ( e.g.  9 of gray 1992 ) , and the sound speed @xmath18 km s@xmath19 ( derived from @xmath20 k ) at @xmath21 to the outer boundary at @xmath22 .",
    "we only consider the derivative with respect to @xmath23 but treat the three components of velocity and magnetic field .",
    "we initially set up a static and cool ( @xmath24 k ) atmosphere and start simulations by injecting the three components of velocity fluctuations from the photosphere with amplitude of each component , @xmath25 , @xmath26 where we adopt a frequency spectrum , @xmath27 , from @xmath28 seconds to @xmath29 minutes .",
    "the normalization of @xmath30 is determined to give @xmath25 .",
    "frequency spectrum of velocity perturbations have been observationally obtained by various instruments .",
    "recent hinode observation by @xcite , which obtained a frequency spectrum from 30 seconds to 70 minutes , shows a breaking power law with a flatter index=-0.6 in the lower frequency range , @xmath31 seconds , and a steeper index = -2.4 in the higher frequency range .",
    "our choice of @xmath32 is a reasonable fit to the observed spectrum with a single power law . for those who are interested in effects of different spectra",
    ", we would like to recall that @xcite performed the 1d mhd simulations with injected perturbations with white noise ( @xmath33 ) and monochromatic waves of frequency @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "various modes of mhd waves are excited by the surface fluctuations ( e.g. isobe et al.2008 ; kato et al.2011 ) , and propagate upwardly ( e.g. , bogdan et al.2003 ; okamoto & de pontieu 2011 ) . the wave , among various modes ,",
    "is supposed to play a major role in driving stellar winds mainly because it travels a long distance to the wind acceleration region ( e.g. , alazraki & couturier 1971 ; hollweg 1973 ) .",
    "a great advantage of the code is that we can determine mass loss rates as a direct output of the injected poynting flux from the photosphere .",
    "propagation , reflection , and dissipation of these mhd waves are directly treated by the dynamical mhd simulations .",
    "we setup the spatially variable grids in order to resolve the waves with the highest frequency ( @xmath28 s. ; shortest wavelength ) we are injecting at least by @xmath36 10 grid points everywhere . on the other hand",
    ", we can not handle scales which are smaller than the grid scale and assume that sub - grid - scale structures are instantly transferred to the thermal energy by cascading processes or shocks to conserve the total energy equation . in our simulations , many shocklets form as a result of steepening of compressive waves which are nonlinearly generated from the propagating waves (  [ sec : engfm ] ) .",
    "these shocklets with the scales smaller than the grid scale are assumed to dissipate and heat up surrounding gas in our treatment .    as for the cooling in the coronal region ,",
    "we adopt the cooling table for the optically thin plasma with the solar abundance @xcite , in which the cooling rate , @xmath37 ( erg @xmath17s@xmath19 ) , is proportional to @xmath38 . for the cooling in the chromosphere",
    ", we adopt an empirical cooling rate @xmath39 erg @xmath17s@xmath19 by @xcite .",
    "this cooling rate takes into account an effect of optically thick cooling under the non - lte conditions ( but see carlsson & leenaarts 2012 for a more detailed treatment based on snapshots of 2d mhd simulations ) .",
    "we smoothly connect the cooling rates in these two regimes by an interpolation . in the transition region ,",
    "the cooling rate is initially @xmath40 at lower heights but shifted to @xmath38 at higher altitudes .",
    "we do not explicitly take into account stellar rotation in the dynamics of the stellar winds .",
    "if a star rotates by more than @xmath10 20 times faster than the present sun , the terminal velocity of the wind will be affected (  [ sec : strot ] ) . however , the mass loss rate is affected little @xcite . the stellar rotation rather significantly affects the strengths of the generated magnetic fields @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider this effect by incorporating wide ranges of the parameters on the magnetic fields .",
    "we investigate how the properties of the stellar winds depend on the following four parameters ( figure [ fig : kgp ] ) : velocity perturbation , @xmath25 , and radial magnetic field strength , @xmath1 , a filling factor , @xmath2 , of open flux tubes , which are all measured at the photosphere , and a typical height , @xmath41 , of closed loops , which surround an open flux tube we are considering .",

    "this is also consistent with the explanation of the saturated stellar winds from the change of the magnetic topology that closed magnetic loop structure , which is expected to dominanty cover the surface of active stars , inhibits the stellar winds @xcite .",

[ tab : sat1 ] ) is also larger due to the enhanced density , the kinetic energy luminosity ( @xmath55 in table .",
    "[ tab : sat1 ] ) slightly decreases because of the low velocity , which is recognized as the saturation of @xmath56 in the top panel of figure [ fig : ftr_dep ] .",

    "the equation shows that @xmath145 sensitively depends on @xmath148 . for the typical condition of the present - day sun , @xmath149 , which gives @xmath150 min . in active stars , e.g. model dd@xmath52 in figure [ fig : snpstr1 ]",
    ", @xmath148 could be large enough to give @xmath151 hours  a day .",
    "recently , @xcite observed the atmosphere of a planet - hosting young star , corot-2a , by using the technic of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "they reported that it could have a very thick chromosphere with height of 10 - 20% of the radius , which is much larger than the chromosphere of the present sun which is only up to @xmath152 1% of the radius .",
    "moreover , they observed an asymmetry in the chromospheric rossiter - mclaughlin effect , which might arise from inhomogeneities of the chromospheric structure .",
    "figure [ fig : extchr ] shows the height of the chromosphere of each simulation run . in the figure , we plot both the maximum ( filled symbols ) and minimum ( open symbols ) values of @xmath139 at @xmath140 k during the time evolution of each simulation . in cases with small radiation flux , the differences between the maximum and minimum heights are small and @xmath139 is typically @xmath153 , which is consistent with the present - day sun ( e.g. imada et al.2011 ) . as the radiation flux increases , the maximum height increases and the minimum height decreases , namely in active cases the transition regions largely move up and down .",
    "the minimum heights in cases with relatively large radiation flux ( in the right part of the figure ) are considerably small , @xmath154(@xmath155 km ) .",
    "moreover in some cases the minimum heights are in the outside of the displayed range . in these cases ,",
    "the temperature increases to @xmath59 k from the next mesh ( @xmath156 7 km ) to the photosphere at some instants .      in our simulations",
    ", we consider the star with the same stellar parameters as the sun , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath20 k , and @xmath16 g @xmath17 .",
    "then , the scaling relations for @xmath56 and @xmath57 in equations ( [ eq : scke ] ) and ( [ eq : mssc ] ) have been derived for the fixed stellar parameters . leaving the basic stellar parameters as variables",
    ", we can derive more general expressions for @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath157 and @xmath158 where the relation for @xmath57 is derived in a similar manner to the reimers ( 1975 ) formula ( see also schrder & cuntz 2005 ) .",
    "these relations should be tested by numerical simulations with stars with different masses , radii , and photospheric densities , which is our future work .",
    "it should be noted that the variables in equations ( [ eq : sckegen ] ) and ( [ eq : msscgen ] ) are not independent each other .",
    "for example , limiting to low - mass ( @xmath159 ) main sequence stars , @xmath160 is related to @xmath119 , @xmath161 (  22 of kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) .",
    "also , the density , @xmath162 , at a photosphere can be estimated from the stellar basic parameters .",
    "for instance , in the cool star condition with effective temperature , 4000 k@xmath163 6000 k , @xmath164 (  9 of gray 1992 ; suzuki 2007 ) . using these dependences and @xmath165 (  22 of kippenhahn & weigert 1990 )",
    ", we can replace the dependences on @xmath160 and @xmath162 in equations ( [ eq : sckegen ] ) and ( [ eq : msscgen ] ) with the dependences on @xmath119 : @xmath166 and @xmath167    equation ( [ eq : msscgen ] ) or ( [ eq : msscgen2 ] ) could be a general formula to estimate mass loss rates of stars with a surface convection zone ( see also cranmer & saar 2011 ) .",
    "once the basic stellar parameters , @xmath160 , @xmath119 , and @xmath168 , are obtained , equation ( [ eq : msscgen ] ) or ( [ eq : msscgen2 ] ) has the three undetermined parameters , @xmath169 , @xmath46 , and @xmath25 .",
    "one can use a typical value , @xmath170 from the simulation results .",
    "@xmath25 is expected to be a fraction of the sound speed at the surface ; @xmath171 km s@xmath19 of the standard case corresponds to @xmath172 % of the sound speed .",
    "@xmath46 , magnetic field strength in _ open field regions _ , is the most unknown parameter among the three . if @xmath57 is obtained by other methods , equation ( [ eq : msscgen ] ) or ( [ eq : msscgen2 ] ) can be used to derive @xmath0 in the opposite way .",
    "we also show general formulae for the saturated values , equations ( [ eq : fitke ] ) and ( [ eq : fitmdot ] ) , with taking into account the dependences on @xmath119 and @xmath160 : @xmath173 and @xmath174 where we here again use @xmath161 for low - mass main sequence stars .",
    "it is expected that stellar rotation is an important ingredient in determining stellar magnetic activities @xcite .",
    "probably related the steep differential rotation owing to the fast rotation of young active stars @xcite , the magnetic field is effectively amplified in fast rotating solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "we take into account the effects of the strong magnetic fields on the stellar winds by incorporating the wide ranges of the parameters on the magnetic field .",
    "in addition to the generated magnetic field strength , the stellar rotation directly affects the dynamics of stellar winds through the magnetocentrifugal force @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum of a star is outwardly transported by the magnetorotating wind , which is the main cause of the deceleration of the stellar rotation @xcite .",
    "we do not take into account this effect in our simulations .",
    "we here briefly discuss possible roles of the magnetocentrifugal force in the dynamics of the stellar winds .",
    "in general , stronger magnetic field and faster rotation affects the dynamics of stellar winds . magnetic energy per mass in magnetorotating winds ( weber & davis 1967 ; see also  9 of lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) is written as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the rotation frequency of a star , @xmath177 is the azimuthal component of the background magnetic field ( @xmath178 because of winding field lines ) , and we here consider the problem in the outer region where the super - radial expansion of the flux tubes already finishes , @xmath179 . for the second transformation in equation ( [ eq : mgrtpf ] ) ,",
    "we have used the relation for the geometry of magnetic field lines under the steady - state condition , @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the azimuthal component of velocity .",
    "if @xmath182 is larger than kinetic energy per mass , the magnetocentrifugal force dominantly works and the wind velocity will be faster than obtained in our simulations . then , we can use a nondimensional parameter , @xmath183 which measures the importance of magnetocentrifugal force , @xcite and the escape velocity , @xmath184 . neglecting numerical factors with an order of unity , @xmath185 corresponds to @xmath186 . ] .",
    "the effect of magnetocentrifugal force becomes important in proportion to magnetic energy and rotation energy but in inversely proportion to a mass loss rate .",
    "we can estimate @xmath187 from a typical case of our simulations for active stars , @xmath188 where @xmath189yr@xmath19 is the mass loss rate of the current sun , and @xmath190 is the kepler ( breakup ) velocity at the stellar surface . equation ( [ eq : cbo2 ] ) is normalized by 10 % of @xmath191 , which gives the dependences on @xmath119 and @xmath160 .",
    "the rotation of the current sun is @xmath192 .",
    "then , equation ( [ eq : cbo1 ] ) indicates that the effect of the magnetocentrifugal force is small if the rotation frequency of a star which gives 100 times of @xmath57 is smaller than 20 times of the current solar rotation frequency . in stars with rotation period",
    "@xmath193 1 day the magnetocentrifugal acceleration is important and the terminal velocity becomes faster , whereas it also depends on the mass loss rate .",
    "we have investigated how the properties of the stellar winds from sun - like stars are determined from the magnetic fields and velocity perturbations at the photosphere .",
    "we performed the 163 models of the mhd simulations in the range of @xmath194 4 orders of magnitude of the wave energy flux from the photosphere .",
    "we examined the properties of the stellar winds of these simulations mainly from an energetics point of view .",
    "0.1 - 10% , with the typical value , @xmath4% , of the input poynting flux of the waves from the photosphere is finally transported to the kinetic energy of the stellar winds .",
    "we derived the scaling relations that dermine the kinetic energy luminosity and mass loss rate of the stellar winds from the properties at the stellar photosphere ( equations [ eq : scke ] , [ eq : mssc ] , [ eq : sckegen ]  [ eq : msscgen2 ] ) .",
    "these relations can be used to estimate the mass losses from solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "we can classify the simulated stellar winds into the unsaturated regime and the saturated regime . when the input wave energies are small , the stellar winds are in the unsaturated state ; an increase of the input wave energy directly leads to strong stellar winds .",
    "in this regime , the reflection of waves dominantly controls the energetics and dynamics of the stellar winds . in the chromosphere and low corona",
    ", the density rapidly decreases with height .",
    "consequently , the speed rapidly increases , which makes waves effectively reflected because of the deformation of the wave shapes .",
    "the reflection is more severe for a smaller wave energy input because the density decreases more rapidly without the support from the magnetic pressure ( @xmath195 ) associated with the waves . in extreme cases , more than 99% of the input poynting energies",
    "are reflected back before reaching the top of the chromosphere .",
    "the mass loss rates of these cases are as small as @xmath10 1% of that of the current sun .",
    "with increasing the input wave energy , the density decreases more slowly in the chromosphere owing to the support by the magnetic pressure of the waves .",
    "the chromosphere of the active cases is time - dependently extended to 10  20 % of the radius , and the transition region moves up and down (  [ sec : evchr ] ) mainly because of the thermally unstable region ( @xmath127 k ) of the radiative cooling function of the gas with the solar abundance @xcite . according to the slow decrease of the density in the chromospheres , the speed changes more gradually , which suppresses the reflection of the waves .",
    "when one increases the input wave energy , the kinetic energy and the mass loss rate of the stellar winds increase more rapidly than the linear dependence on the input energy . in cases with the large energy inputs for active stars ,",
    "more than 10% of the input wave energy from the photosphere reach the top of the chromosphere .",
    "for the large wave energy inputs , the stellar winds are in the saturated state ; an increase of the input energy does not raise the kinetic energy of the winds but enhances the radiative loss .",
    "increasing the input wave energy from the unsaturated state to the saturated state , the densities of the transition region and corona monotonically increase , which gives larger kinetic energy and mass loss of the stellar winds .",
    "the increase of the densities also raise the radiative cooling .",
    "since the radiative loss is proportional to @xmath38 in the optically thin plasma , the increase of the radiative loss is faster than the increase of the wind kinetic energy with increasing the input wave energy from the photosphere . in the saturated state ,",
    "most of the poynting energy at the top of the chromospheres is transferred to the radition in the transition regions and coronae , and a tiny fraction of the energy is available for the kinetic energy of the stellar winds .",
    "the saturation level has the power - law dependence on @xmath0 , @xmath196 ( equation [ eq : fitke ] ) , which can be understood from the nonlinear dissipation of the waves .",
    "@xmath0 determines the magnetic field strength in the upper corona and wind region where the super - radial expansion of the flux tubes already finishes . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "the nonlinearity of the waves , @xmath197 becomes systematically larger , which results in faster dissipation .",
    "then , more wave energy dissipates at lower altitudes where the density is higher , and mostly escapes by the radiation loss . for large @xmath0 , the opposite explanation can be done ; more wave energy remains up to higher altitudes and contributes to driving the strong stellar winds .",
    "the positive correlation of the saturation level with @xmath0 indicates that in order to drive strong stellar winds the filling factor of open flux tubes should not be so small , as well as the surface magnetic field should be sufficiently strong .",
    "this is consistent with the explanation that closed magnetic loops inhibit stellar winds from active stars . based on our results , we introduce a speculative scenario for the evolution of the stellar winds from sun - like stars (  [ sec : cmpobs ] ; figure [ fig : sctev ] ) . at very early time",
    ", the surface of a star is mostly covered with closed magnetic field ( small @xmath2 ) , and then , the mass loss rate is not so large because of the low saturation level , even though the surface field strength ( @xmath1 ) is large .",
    "the magnetic field structure is eventually relaxed so that open flux tubes occupy a larger fraction ( @xmath2 increases ) and the mass loss rate increases .",
    "after that , the mass loss rate gradually decreases to the current solar level with decreasing magnetic field strength .",
