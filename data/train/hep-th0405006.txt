    "einstein equations describing general relativity and gravitation , form a system of coupled non - linear partial differential equations , which is extremely hard to solve , even resorting to state - of - the - art computing . therefore exact solutions to einstein equations , which are possible to obtain only in special instances , are of fundamental importance .",
    "they allow us to probe essential features of general relativity .",
    "for example , having at hand the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution it was possible to match general relativity predictions against experimental observations .",
    "once an exact solution is found , one must examine it in detail , and investigate the physical properties of such a solution .",
    "one of the most important aspects is the stability of a given solution .",
    "in fact , if a solution is not stable , then it will most certainly not be found in nature , unless the instability timescale is much larger than the age of our universe .",
    "what does one mean by stability ?",
    "in this classical context , stability means that a given initially bounded perturbation of the spacetime remains bounded for all times .",
    "for example , the schwarzschild spacetime is stable against all kinds of perturbations , massive or massless @xcite . on the other hand the kerr spacetime ,",
    "describing a rotating black hole , is stable against massless field perturbations but not against massive bosonic fields @xcite .",
    "the physics behind this instability is related to a phenomenon known as superradiance , a process which is known for several decades , and which consists basically on a scattering process which extracts energy from the scattering potential .",
    "for example , the klein - gordon equation for a charged scalar particle on a step - like potential already displays such a `` superradiant '' scattering , i.e. , the energy of the reflected wave is larger than the incident one @xcite .",
    "the first classical example of superradiant scattering , which would lead to the notion of superradiant scattering in black hole spacetimes , was given by zeldovich @xcite , by examining what happens when scalar waves impinge upon a rotating cylindrical absorbing object .",
    "considering a wave of the form @xmath0 incident upon such a rotating object , zeldovich concluded that if the frequency @xmath1 of the incident wave satisfies @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the angular velocity of the body , then the scattered wave is amplified .",
    "if the `` rotating object '' is a kerr black hole , then superradiant scattering also occurs @xcite for frequencies @xmath1 satisfying ( [ super ] ) , but where @xmath3 is now the angular velocity of the black hole .",
    "if one could find a way to feed the amplified scattered wave onto the black hole again , then one could in principle extract as much energy as one likes from the black hole ( as long as it is less than the total rotational energy ) .",
    "the first proposal of this kind was in fact made by zeldovich @xcite , who suggested to surround the rotating cylinder by a reflecting mirror . in this case",
    "the wave would bounce back and forth , between the mirror and the cylinder , amplifying itself each time .",
    "a similar situation can be achieved for a kerr black hole : surround it by a spherical mirror and excite a given multipole @xmath4 wave in it .",
    "then the total extracted energy should grow exponentially until finally the radiation pressure destroys the mirror .",
    "this is exactly the same principle behind the instability of kerr black holes against massive bosonic perturbations , because in this case the mass of the field works as a wall near infinity @xcite .",
    "the system black hole plus mirror is known as press and teukolsky s black hole bomb @xcite , which has been recently investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for the system to really become unstable , the mirror must have a radius larger than a certain critical value .",
    "this is because the oscillation frequencies are dictated by the mirror , and go like @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the mirror radius .",
    "thus for superradiance to work , one must have by ( [ super ] ) , @xmath7 . in principle , black holes in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space should have similar properties as those of the black hole bomb , since the boundary of anti - de sitter spacetime behaves as a wall .",
    "in fact , a similar reasoning applied to kerr@xmath8anti - de sitter ( kerr - ads ) black holes lead one to verify the stability of large rotating black holes in anti - de sitter spacetime ( the stability of these large black holes was proven by hawking and reall @xcite ) , and lead also to the conjecture that small kerr - ads black holes should be unstable @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to prove the instability of small kerr - ads black holes , by solving directly the wave equation for a scalar field , in the large wavelength approximation , by using matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "we shall consider a scalar field in the vicinity of a kerr - ads black hole , with an exterior geometry described by the line element @xcite @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the cosmological length associated with the cosmological constant @xmath12 .",
    "this metric describes the gravitational field of the kerr black hole , with mass @xmath13 , angular momentum @xmath14 , and has an event horizon at @xmath15 ( the largest root of @xmath16 ) .",
    "a characteristic and important parameter of a kerr black hole is the angular velocity of its event horizon given by @xmath17 in order to avoid singularities , the black hole rotation is constrained to be @xmath18 in absence of sources , which we consider to be our case , the evolution of the scalar field is dictated by the klein - gordon equation in a kerr - ads spacetime , @xmath19\\phi=0 $ ] . here , @xmath20 is the ricci scalar of the kerr - ads spacetime , @xmath21 is a coupling constant , and @xmath22 is the mass of the scalar field . for simplicity , and without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose the value of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in order that the klein - gordon equation stays simply as @xmath23 .",
    "to make the whole problem more tractable , it is convenient to separate the field as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the ads spheroidal angular functions , and the azimuthal number @xmath4 takes on integer ( positive or negative ) values . for our purposes , it is enough to consider positive @xmath1 s in ( [ separation ] ) @xcite . inserting this in klein - gordon equation , we get the following angular and radial wave equations for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27\\tilde{s}^m _",

    "first , we require that the scalar field vanishes at @xmath32 because the ads space behaves effectively as a reflecting box , i.e. , the ads infinity works as a mirror wall ( but see also @xcite and references therein for another possible set of boundary conditions ) .",
    "second , near the horizon @xmath15 , the scalar field as given by ( [ separation ] ) behaves as @xmath33 where the tortoise @xmath34 coordinate is defined implicitly by @xmath35 . requiring ingoing waves at the horizon , which is the physically acceptable solution",
    ", one must impose a negative group velocity @xmath36 for the wave packet . since @xmath37 we must thus use the minus sign in ( [ bc2 ] ) . to satisfy these two boundary conditions simultaneously ,",
    "the frequencies @xmath1 must take on certain special values , which are called quasinormal frequencies ( qn frequencies , @xmath38 ) and the associated modes are called quasinormal modes ( qnms ) . in general",
    ", @xmath38 will be a complex quantity , signaling the decay of the field , or then its growth .",
    "note that according to the field decomposition ( [ separation ] ) if the imaginary part of @xmath1 is positive then the field will grow exponentially as time goes by .",
    "thus we say that the system is unstable if the imaginary part of @xmath38 is positive .",
    "in this section , we will show that small kerr - ads black holes are unstable .",
    "we shall , within some approximations , compute the characteristic qn frequencies for a scalar field , and show that they do have positive imaginary parts .",
    "the instability is due to the presence of an effective `` reflecting mirror '' at the ads infinity , since the waves are then successively impinging on the small ads black hole and being reflected at infinity @xcite .",
    "we shall see that this interpretation agrees in all aspects with the study of the black hole bomb @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath39 , i.e. , that the compton wavelength of the scalar particle is much larger than the typical size of the black hole , and that the ads black hole is small , i.e. , that the size of the black hole is much smaller than the typical ads radius , @xmath40 .",
    "we will also assume slow rotation : @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "following a matching procedure introduced in @xcite , we divide the space outside the event horizon in two regions , namely , the near - region , @xmath43 , and the far - region , @xmath44 .",
    "we will solve the radial equation ( [ wave eq separated ] ) in each one of these two regions .",
    "then , we will match the near - region and the far - region solutions in the overlapping region where @xmath45 is satisfied .",
    "when the correct boundary conditions are imposed upon the solutions , we shall get a defining equation for @xmath38 , and the stability or instability of the spacetime depends basically on the sign of the imaginary component of @xmath38 .      for small ads black holes , @xmath46 , in the near - region , @xmath47",

    "we expect that the allowed spectrum of discrete real frequencies that can propagate in the far - region of the kerr - ads black hole is equal to the one of the pure ads background since , at large distances from the inner boundary , both backgrounds are similar .",
    "however , the existence of the black hole inner boundary implies that once radiation crosses this zone it will be scattered by the black hole ( more precisely it will be scattered by the potential barrier outside the event horizon ) and its amplitude will decrease or , eventually , since conditions for superradiance might be present , it will grow leading to an instability .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of @xcite , we expect that the presence of this scattering by the black hole induces a small complex imaginary part in the allowed frequencies , @xmath111 $ ] , that describes the slow decay of the amplitude of the wave if @xmath112 , or the slowly growing instability of the mode if @xmath113 .",

    "now , we have @xmath134 in the slow rotation approximation .",
