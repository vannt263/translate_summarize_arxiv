    "patchiness , or the uneven distribution of substances of organisms , is ubiquitously observed in the ocean @xcite . in complex situations such as the marine ecosystems , characterized by the interplay of population dynamics and an ambient fluid motion which may differently affect individual populations , the question of how a localized availability of nutrients ( or preys , or , in chemical terms , activators ) may affect the distribution of primary producers ( or predators , or inhibitors , respectively ; in the following we refer to preys and predators ) is a crucial and challenging problem .    according to @xcite , the possible causes originating patchiness in marine ecosystems",
    "may be grouped in different categories : fluid motion , biological growth coupled with dispersive processes , less ubiquitous mechanisms like swarming , vertical migration , and others .",
    "in addition to patchiness , localized availability of _ food _ may occur in correspondence of localized sub - ecosystems , such as posidonia oceanica beds ( for a review see @xcite ) : they display a quite complex structure in which the most important features arise from direct consumption of the plant and epiphyte - herbivore interactions , although a portion of the trophic chain is based on suspended matter @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive description of such processes leads to the study of the so called advection - reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "these are partial differential equations of the type : @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the concentration of the @xmath4-th reactive ( in biological or chemical terms ) species or substance , and the functions @xmath5 describe the reaction , or the population , intrinsic dynamics .",
    "the possible explicit spatial and temporal dependence may model the influence of temporal and spatial inhomogeneities in food , temperature , etc .",
    "the term @xmath6 represents advection by a given solenoidal ( i.e. incompressible @xmath7 ) velocity field @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the term @xmath9 describes diffusion of the @xmath4-th species or substance with diffusivity @xmath10 . in writing ( [ ard ] )",
    "we are assuming that the evolution of the advected concentrations does not affect that of the underlying flow @xmath8 .",
    "this is definitely reasonable at the scales we are interested in , even though it is worth mentioning that at much smaller scales the presence of organisms may affect the rheological properties of seawater @xcite .",
    "in some situations it would be necessary to consider a different velocity field for each of the @xmath11 concentrations @xmath12 .",
    "this may happen , for instance , if different organisms live at different mean depths , leading to differences in the experienced flow .",
    "in such cases one has to replace eq .",
    "( [ ard ] ) by @xmath13 in this paper , however , we will only consider the case given by eq .",
    "( [ ard ] ) in which the same velocity field advects all the substances .    introducing the lagrangian time derivative @xmath14 , eq .",
    "( [ ard ] ) can be written in the form @xmath15 if diffusion is neglected , it is simple to write the @xmath2 in terms of the solutions of the lagrangian evolution equation @xmath16 and the reactive evolution equation @xmath17 this set of coupled ordinary differential equations describe the advection - reaction process in a lagrangian frame : fluid particles move according to ( [ velo ] ) , and reactions among the @xmath12 s occur inside each fluid particle , as expressed by ( [ reac ] ) , where @xmath18 are the concentrations at a particular fluid particle ( the one at @xmath19 at time @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 ) . denoting by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the formal solutions of ( [ velo ] ) and ( [ reac ] ) respectively ( i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 ) we can write the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ard ] ) in the form ( with @xmath27 ) @xmath28 the case @xmath29 needs a more elaborated treatment .",
    "in addition to the time dependence , @xmath23 will have also an explicit space dependence if the @xmath5 s have it .",
    "obviously , the detailed understanding of the above class of partial differential equations constitute a formidable task .",
    "however , at this stage of development , we are just interested in the search for generic behaviors expected when few typical characteristics of the flow and of the population dynamics are considered .",
    "thus , if , for example , we concentrate on flows of geophysical nature , horizontal motion turns out to be much more intense than vertical one as soon as one considers scales larger than a few kilometers .",
    "this justifies restricting in the following to incompressible twodimensional flows .",
    "a turbulent bidimensional flow would be a way to model the irregular advection process to which suspended matter is subjected in real oceans .",
    "there are however simpler classes of flows which share some basic characteristics with turbulence , but are much more accessible to analysis : lagrangian chaotic flows@xcite .",
    "these are smooth velocity fields , with some simple time dependence in the eulerian description , but which lead to chaotic trajectories of fluid elements , with the associated stretching and folding , in the lagrangian description . in this restricted framework",
    ", it is well known that even periodic time - dependence in two - dimensional incompressible flows leads generically to chaotic motion of fluid particles .    rather than integrating the full equations describing the continuous in time dynamics , and",
    "since our interest lies mainly in a qualitative characterization of the population system , we will resort in this paper to a discrete in time mapping - approach in terms of discrete - time dynamical systems .",
    "this approach is numerically very efficient , and has proven to be extremely productive to study the impact of chaotic advection on mixing @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to mimic the advection and reaction processes in terms of maps that capture the main features of each aspect .",
    "thus , since we will be looking at processes taking place in 2d incompressible flows , the advective part of our model is naturally described by a twodimensional symplectic map .",
    "it is well known that lagrangian motion in such systems is typically chaotic and with a rather rich behavior .",
    "in addition , the transported fluid parcel contains concentrations of active chemical substances or biological specimens subjected to a specific dynamics that will be also modeled in terms of a map .",
    "also , it is worth noticing that even though this is not done in this work , diffusion can be easily reincorporated into the model by averaging , after each iteration of the maps , the concentration of the different species contained in the fluid elements over a region of size @xmath30 , where @xmath10 is the corresponding diffusivity and @xmath31 is a characteristic time scale of the system .    the general ideas and formalism sketched above will be made more concrete in the following , and applied to tackle our main problem : the _ influence of inhomogeneities of the distribution of preys on that of predators_. we will make use of some known results for random maps , and compare our discrete - time approach with results obtained in a continuous - time description of the problem @xcite . in section ii we will discuss the approach to population dynamics in terms of maps ; in section iii our particular model is presented and compared with results for a random logistic map ; the analogy helps in the interpretation of the resulting spatial structure of predators , which is described in section iv , and discussed in section v.",
    "let us now present the general idea of our approach for the analysis of the population dynamics in terms of maps .",
    "it is easy to understand that for time - periodic velocity fields , i.e. @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the period , eq  ( [ velo ] ) can be described by a discrete - time dynamical system .",
    "the position @xmath34 is univocally determined by @xmath35 . in addition ( because of the periodic velocity field ) the map @xmath36 can not depend on @xmath20 . since a periodic time dependence is enough to induce lagrangian chaos , and because of the above mathematical simplifications , we particularize our study to time - periodic velocity fields , for which we can write @xmath37 now , time is measured in units of the period @xmath33 . if @xmath38 is incompressible , the map ( [ sol ] ) is volume ( area in @xmath0 ) preserving , i.e. , @xmath39 . in @xmath0 the map ( [ sol ] ) is symplectic , i.e. the discrete - time version of a hamiltonian system .",
    "usually , it is not simple at all to obtain @xmath40 for a given @xmath8 .",
    "however , one can directly write models for @xmath41 which contain the qualitative features of the flow one is trying to model .",
    "in addition , the transported fluid parcel contains species subjected to their own population dynamics . denoting the solution of ( [ reac ] ) after one period of the flow ( @xmath42 ) by @xmath43 , the evolution rule for the interacting concentrations @xmath44",
    "is expressed in terms of a map : @xmath45    as before , @xmath43 will carry additional explicit time and space dependencies if ( [ reac ] ) is not autonomous in space or time . the discrete - time version of eq .  ( [ cosol ] ) is : @xmath46    in the following we particularize this general approach to a particular model .",
    "the main interest of our study is to consider the problem of how the spatial structure of the prey spatial distribution may affect the one of the predators . in this section",
    "we study a particular model and present its analogies with the random map .",
    "this will enable us to use the already known properties of this random map to get a further insight into the influence of the distribution of preys on the predator patterns .",
    "we will considered a single - species population dynamics , i.e. the predator evolves for fixed prey distribution , and under the influence of the flow , but the distribution of the prey is a non - dynamic variable , in the sense that it is not transported by the flow and is maintained at fixed values undisturbed by the predator action .",
    "this is the simplest setting in which the effects of a localized source of nutrients on an advected predator will show up .",
    "the model is the following : the positions of the _ fluid parcels _ are advected by a standard map @xcite , i.e. a 2d symplectic map defined in the square of side @xmath47 by @xmath48    it is not integrable for @xmath49 . as @xmath50 increases",
    "chaotic regions occupy larger areas , and the original kam tori ( regular non - chaotic orbits ) are successively destroyed . for @xmath51",
    "large enough the kam tori occupy a very small region and practically the whole phase space is a unique chaotic region .    the model is completed by stating the evolution rules for the predator - prey interactions .",
    "we denote with @xmath52 the stationary spatially inhomogenous distribution of preys , and with @xmath53 the concentration of predators in point @xmath54 at time @xmath20 .",
    "we take it to evolve in each fluid parcel according to the well known logistic map : @xmath55 , but with a growth rate parameter @xmath56 determined by the presence of preys , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "the complete evolution equation ( [ cosoldis ] ) is @xmath58 the standard map has been written in the compact form ( [ sol ] ) with @xmath59 .",
    "we now introduce the particular form of the localized prey distribution @xmath52 : @xmath60 $ } , \\",
    "\\forall y\\\\          r_0 & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{step}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 .",
    "we are suggesting a striped spatial distribution of the preys ( with strip width @xmath62 ) , which basically represents ( due to the @xmath47-periodicity of the flow ) the simplest , space - periodic fashion to mimic a patchy distribution .",
    "a fraction @xmath63 of system area has the value @xmath64 , and fraction @xmath65 , the @xmath66 .",
    "the heuristic idea that will guide our analysis is that , if mixing provided by the advection map is strong enough , fluid parcels will visit regions with the different values of @xmath56 in a stochastic way , so that the lagrangian evolution of the concentrations will be well described by a random logistic map , i.e. a map of the form @xmath67 where the random variable @xmath68 can take only two values @xmath69 and @xmath70 is independent of any previous @xmath68 .",
    "the random map ( [ randommap1 ] ) has been studied in @xcite for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to the situation in which for a value of @xmath66 the population dynamics is attracted by a fixed point , whereas chaotic population dynamics occurs for @xmath64 .",
    "the alternancy in time of these two tendencies gives rise to nontrivial behavior .",
    "numerical ( and some analytical ) computations @xcite give the following results for ( [ randommap1 ] ) with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , for different values of @xmath63 :    * if @xmath73 the lyapunov exponent @xmath74 is negative , i.e. there is exponential convergence of two initially close sequences @xmath75 generated with the same sequence @xmath76 but slightly different initial conditions @xmath77 . in this case , the sequences are attracted by @xmath78 . * if @xmath79 the lyapunov exponent is negative again , but now the sequences do not converge to any fixed point .",
    "they wander in an irregular and seemingly chaotic manner ( of the _ on - off intermittency _ type ) .",
    "the meaning of the negative value of @xmath80 is that close initial values of @xmath81 evolve , under the same sequence @xmath68 , towards the same irregular trajectory .",
    "this is a case of chaotic synchronization related to the phenomenon of synchronization by noise @xcite . *",
    "if @xmath82 the lyapunov exponent is positive , i.e. there exponential divergence of two initially close sequences @xmath75 , behaving both chaotically .    as a first check confirming that our advection - population dynamics model is close to the random map when mixing is strong , we fix @xmath71 and @xmath72 , as in @xcite .",
    "this describes a system in which predators are advected over regions in which not enough food is available ( @xmath71 leads to population extinction ) and over the strip - like regions in which preys are abundant ( leading to chaotic population dynamics of the predators ) .",
    "we iterate ( [ lagran ] ) to obtain @xmath83 , and then calculate the reaction lyapunov exponent @xmath84 for our system : @xmath85 the initial condition @xmath86 was a smooth function proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath84 measures the rate of convergence or divergence of two initially similar concentration values @xmath81 at the same fluid particle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdar ] we show @xmath84 as a function of @xmath63 for different values of @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath50 is increased above a high enough value ( e.g. @xmath88 , for which the standard map shows a unique ergodic chaotic region @xcite ) , @xmath84 approaches the lyapunov exponent @xmath80 of the random map @xcite . on the other side , when @xmath50 is small , this correspondence is lost .",
    "therefore , exploiting this equivalence we can study different regimes of our system depending on the value of the parameter @xmath63",
    ". in particular , the spatial patterns of the advected field are strongly dependent of the value of @xmath84 .",
    "next section is dedicated to the study of these structures .",
    "the three regimes described above for the random map are also found for the behavior of the lyapunov exponent @xmath84 as a function of @xmath63 in our advection model , with just some minor quantitative differences , e.g. in the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( in particular , in most of our calculations we take @xmath91 , which gives @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "these three regimes give rise to the following different predator spatial structures :    * for @xmath94 , the concentration of predators vanishes in all the space .",
    "the nutrient area is too small to support a stable population . *",
    "if @xmath95 , a typical spatial pattern appears .",
    "a relatively high , but very intermittent , concentration of predators appears in the area occupied by preys .",
    "moreover , the concentration pattern displays fractal features . *",
    "if @xmath96 , the spatial concentration of predators shows a random pattern .",
    "no typical structure seems to emerge .    whereas the result for case i ) is self - evident ,",
    "cases ii ) and iii ) need a more elaborated study .",
    "we proceed in the following subsections .      the regime which we have labeled above with ii )",
    "is characterized by a negative reaction lyapunov exponent @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", we observe numerically ( see fig . [",
    "fig : smallp ] ) the existence of a typical structure of the reactive field , which follows the strip - like structure of the preys .",
    "moreover , a fractal pattern seems to be displayed by the distribution .",
    "let us proceed to a quantitative characterization of these features .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite study the general continuous - time case of a chemically or biologically decaying field ( thus with a negative reaction lyapunov exponent ) advected by a chaotic 2d flow . since periodic velocity fields are used , it is straightforward to apply the results in these papers to our case with discrete time .",
    "nevertheless , a fundamental assumption in these studies is that a source term in the equations , analogous to our prey distribution , is a smooth function of space .",
    "the quantitative results of @xcite would fail ( see e.g. eq .  ( 10 ) in @xcite ) when discontinuities are present in the source , as in our localized prey distribution ( [ step ] ) .",
    "therefore , in our calculations , and with the view on characterizing the spatial patterns , we will use a continuous approximation to the previous step function describing the distribution of nutrients , which would allow us to compare our results ( in the regime of @xmath97 ) with those in @xcite .",
    "the approximation is performed by truncating the fourier transform of the step function of width @xmath63 ( eq .  ( [ step ] ) and smoothing properly the coefficients @xcite .",
    "the final expression we use is : @xmath98 for any @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "( [ fig : cut ] ) shows a @xmath101 cut of this smoothed distribution of nutrients .",
    "a quantitative characterization of the observed structures can be performed in terms of structure functions .",
    "in particular , the structure function of order one , @xmath102 , is defined by : @xmath103 where @xmath104 indicates an average taken over the different spatial points @xmath54 along a line in the system . in @xcite",
    "the scaling of @xmath102 is calculated with the result @xmath105 when @xmath106 , with @xmath107 when @xmath108 and @xmath109 , being @xmath110 the lyapunov exponent of the lagrangian motion ( [ velo ] ) .",
    "the above expression for @xmath111 is just an approximation to which multifractal corrections should be in principle added @xcite , but we are not going to consider them here .    the lyapunov exponent of the standard map , for @xmath50 high enough , is given @xcite by : @xmath112 . in our calculations for @xmath91",
    "we are in the above mentioned conditions , that is , @xmath109 for all the values of @xmath63 .",
    "( [ fig : abslambdar ] ) shows @xmath113 as a function of @xmath63 for @xmath91 ( the smooth approximation to the spatial distribution of preys is used ) .",
    "in addition , we have numerically calculated the scaling exponent @xmath111 of @xmath102 in lines across the central strip of nutrients , and multiplied it by @xmath114 for different values of @xmath63 .",
    "the agreement between both quantities is quite good for @xmath63 near @xmath89 , confirming the expression @xmath107 , although it gets worse as @xmath115 .",
    "the reason for this are the already mentioned multifractal corrections to the scaling exponent of the structure function , but a deeper discussion about this will be given in a subsequent work .",
    "the agreement allows us to understand the pattern displayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig : smallp ] ) in terms of the filamental fractal patterns discussed in @xcite for continuous - time dynamics .",
    "the observed fractal structures are revealing the stable and unstable manifolds ( local contracting and expanding directions ) attached to each point of the phase space of the standard map .",
    "it should be noted however that there is here a much larger amount of irregularities at small scales than in the patterns analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the reason is the much more irregular dynamics associated to the logistic map considered here .",
    "the lagrangian evolution of @xmath116 is related to the one of the logistic random map , which is of the _ on - off intermittency _ type .",
    "models considered in @xcite displayed simple local relaxation behavior . the small - scale structure seen in fig .  [ fig : smallp ] will introduce stronger multifractal corrections in higher order structure functions .",
    "we finally remark that when a discontinuous distribution of preys such as ( [ step ] ) is considered , the relationship @xmath107 is not satisfied at all .",
    "now we proceed to study the case @xmath117 . in this regime , the reaction lyapunov exponent @xmath84 is positive , i.e. the chemical or biological part of our system is also chaotic .",
    "the patterns calculated in this regime have random appearance , being dominated by strong small - scale irregularity with very small amount of structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : largep ] ) .",
    "in fact , the scaling exponents of the first - order structure function are close to zero , as corresponding to a random discontinuous field .",
    "this random structure is easy to understand once one has realized that @xmath118 in this range of @xmath63 : neighboring sites , even if they have initially nearly similar concentration values , and even when they remain close for long time so that they experience close values of the sequence @xmath35 , will unavoidably develop growing differences in in concentration values , thus leading to the observed discontinuities at small scales .",
    "summing up , spatial structures with fractal features ( of filamental type ) appear for the predator field in a range of values of the size of the nutrient patch @xmath63 .",
    "an increasing amount of small - scale randomness appears when @xmath63 is increased , until structure is finally lost .",
    "the analogy with the random map model has allowed us to understand this behavior as being originated by the change in the value of the reaction lyapunov exponent @xmath84 when @xmath63 is varied . in particular , structure is lost when @xmath84 becomes positive .",
    "for @xmath63 small enough , global extinction occurs , since most of the system has a parameter value for which @xmath78 is the only attractor .",
    "our results have been obtained for a particular set of coupled maps , and for a specific nutrient distribution .",
    "we do not expect major qualitative changes in the above findings if the standard map is replaced by a different advecting flow , as long as the lyapunov exponent @xmath110 takes the same value .",
    "this belief is supported by the more detailed arguments of refs . @xcite and @xcite for the time - continuous case .",
    "it should be said however that the quantitative strength of multifractal corrections to simple expression such as @xmath107 will depend on the particular flow chosen .",
    "our choice of the logistic map as the population dynamics to study is certainly important for the results obtained .",
    "our results should describe the behavior under other population models as long as their parameters take values favoring chaotic oscillations in a localized portion of space , and favoring relaxation to a fixed point in the rest .",
    "the election of the logistic map has allowed the use of results known for random logistic maps , thus helping to interpret the different patterns in terms of the value of @xmath84 and its relationship with @xmath110 .",
    "those quantities would be the right tool for the interpretation of advection - reaction patterns in other population or chemical models .",
    "diffusion has been discarded in the present work .",
    "we expect that its only effect would be to smooth out any small - scale fractal or random structure below a size of the order of @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , our numerical calculations have an _ effective diffusion _ which comes from our minimal spatial resolution . as mentioned above ,",
    "a more controlled way to introduce diffusion is to perform explicitly , after each map operation , an average of the concentrations of fluid particles closer than the diffusion length .",
    "we finally mention that the map approach turns out to be an extremely efficient method from the numerical point of view , as compared to direct solution of partial differential equations such as ( [ ard ] ) or other continuous approaches .",
