    "recently there has been much study on the virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) .",
    "several experiments have been proposed and are being performed in order to get more information about the structure of the nucleon via the process  @xcite .    at low energies , real compton scattering from the nucleon",
    "are known to be described in terms of two quantities for the nucleon structure - the electric ( @xmath7 ) and the magnetic ( @xmath8 ) polarizability .",
    "it is a natural thought that the virtual compton scattering could provide even more information on the structure of the nucleon .",
    "they are called the generalized polarizabilities and are functions of the four - momentum transfer @xmath1 of the in - going virtual photon .",
    "the virtual photon could also carry a longitudinal polarization .",
    "theoretically guichon , liu and thomas developed the formalism of the generalized polarizabilities  @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the structure - dependent part beyond the low energy theorem in terms of a multipole expansion .",
    "they also gave a first estimate for the ten generalized polarizabilities using the non - relativistic quark model and elaborated the study including the recoil effects  @xcite .",
    "using an effective lagrangian vanderhaeghen  @xcite obtained the @xmath1 behavior of the electric and the magnetic polarizabilities of the proton .",
    "the slopes of the electric and the magnetic polarizabilities were predicted by several authors with several frameworks , such as the linear sigma model  @xcite and the heavy - baryon formulation of the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .    in this letter , we attempt a different point of view to describe the generalized electric polarizability based on a topological soliton model ( skyrme model ) . within many soliton models , only the expression and the value of @xmath7 at @xmath9 have been obtained .",
    "the present work is the first trial to give the slope of @xmath7 among the topological and non - topological soliton models .",
    "we also obtain the leading chiral terms of @xmath7 and its slope and show that these agree with the results of the linear sigma model and the heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "our starting point is a @xmath10-gauged effective model .",
    "the gauged skyrme lagrangian is = tr[d_u^ d^u ] + tr+m_^2(2-tr[u ] ) where @xmath11 is the pion decay constant , @xmath12 is the dimensionless skyrme parameter and the @xmath13 is the @xmath14 chiral field . the covariant derivative is defined as d_u=_u+i e a _ , where @xmath15 is the electromagnetic field and q is the charge matrix . q=+ .",

    "the lagrangian @xmath16 has the classical solution for the configuration called the hedgehog u_h = exp[i f(r ) ] .",

    "in this article the virtual compton scattering refers to the reaction ^*+p + p where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively a space - like virtual photon , a real photon and a proton .",

    "@xcite extended let to include the higher order terms in terms of a multipole expansion .",
    "the higher order terms rely on the excitation of the nucleon and are determined by the non - born amplitude .",
    "the same authors developed an appropriate formalism to describe the non - born amplitude and defined the so - called generalized polarizabilities ( gps ) , which are functions of @xmath1 .",
    "the gps include the electric and the magnetic polarizabilities defined through the real compton scattering amplitude or the static energy shifts in the presence of uniform electromagnetic fields .",
    "we refer the details of the analysis of gps to the reference  @xcite and use their definitions only .    a generalized polarizability(gp )",

    "as is clear from the interaction ( [ eq : lagt ] ) , the @xmath32 will have two contributions ; one is the seagull term and the other the dispersive term .",

    "( [ eq : lag2 ] ) .",
    "the dispersive term , @xmath34 , is coming from the second order perturbation theory applied to the linear interaction in @xmath15 , eq .",

    "the negative parity excited state , @xmath36 , most contributing to the electric dipole matrix element @xmath37 is the bound state of the ground state nucleon and the quantum pion .",
    "there is a general belief that the @xmath38 is much smaller than the @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "thus we neglect the dispersive term .    using the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag2 ] ) and the formula given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) we obtain ( q)=e^2_0^dr r^4 sin^2f[^2+(f^2 + ) ] .",

    "[ fig ] , we plot the @xmath1 dependence of the generalized electric polarizability .",

    "our result is comparable with the predictions of the linear sigma model  @xcite and the constituent quark model  @xcite , the comparisons with which are made in the following in addition to the comparison with chpt  @xcite .    using the equation ( [ proeq ] ) and the goldberger - treiman relation  @xcite",
    "one can easily show that the function @xmath17 behaves asymptotically as f(r)~ ( 1+m_r)e^-m_r .",
