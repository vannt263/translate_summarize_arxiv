    "the rates for @xmath0 decay into @xmath1 and a scalar resonance , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are measured by the cleo collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite respectively and the rates are relatively large .",
    "the @xmath3 is seen through its decay into @xmath9 and the @xmath4 through the @xmath10 channel .",
    "related references on the issue can be seen in the pdg @xcite",
    ". theoretical work on these decays is scarce and is mostly devoted to issues related to cp violation or @xmath11 mixing . in ref .",
    "@xcite a thorough study is done of the @xmath12 reaction and the amplitude is parametrized in terms of form factors , resonance parameters and different couplings , amounting to a set of 33 free parameters , which are fitted to the belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite data .",
    "the purpose is to have a good amplitude that can be used to determine the @xmath11 mixing parameters and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) angle @xmath13 .",
    "the aim of the present work is different , we only evaluate the part of the @xmath12 amplitude corresponding to a @xmath1 and two pions propagating in @xmath14-wave , which will show the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances .",
    "in addition we study the @xmath15 amplitude , where the @xmath4 resonance shows up , and relate it to the former one .",
    "however , we show that , by using basic symmetries and the chiral unitary approach to deal with the meson meson interaction in coupled channels , one is able to determine the shapes of the different amplitudes and the relative weight to each other with no free parameters .",
    "hence genuine predictions for the shapes of these amplitudes and the relative weights of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be made and compared with experiment .",
    "the chiral unitary approach for meson meson interaction makes use of the bethe salpeter ( bs ) equation in coupled channels .",
    "one takes all possible meson meson channels that couple within @xmath16 to certain given quantum numbers and the bs equation guaranties exact unitary .",
    "the kernel ( potential ) for the bs equation is taken from the chiral lagrangians @xcite and there is freedom for only some regularization scale in the meson meson loops , which is fitted to the meson meson scattering data . a good agreement with experimental data is obtained up to 1.2 gev @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of this approach is that the resonances @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath17 are automatically generated from these potentials and the use of the bs equations . in this way these resonances qualify as dynamically generated states , some kind of composite , or molecular , meson meson states , in the same way as the deuteron qualifies as a bound state of a proton and a neutron and not a more exotic object  @xcite .",
    "the approach not only provides the meson meson amplitudes but has been tested successfully in virtually any reaction where any of the former resonances is produced .",
    "the latest test was the study of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays into @xmath20 and @xmath21 which was done in ref .",
    "@xcite ( a list of different reactions where the former resonances are produced can also be found there ) , where a natural explanation was given of the observed facts that the @xmath7 decays into @xmath21 , while no signal is seen for @xmath20 , and the @xmath5 decays into @xmath22 and only a small fraction is seen for the @xmath23 .    the @xmath0 decay into @xmath1 and a scalar resonance , @xmath2 , @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4 is a privileged case to test the nature of these resonances . indeed , as we shall see , the three processes are cabibbo allowed and the rates of production are big compared to those of the @xmath5 decays into @xmath6 and one of these resonances , where necessarily one of the vertices , the @xmath24 , is cabibbo suppressed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4 has not been reported in @xmath5 , @xmath7 decays . as one can see in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the decay of @xmath7 into @xmath6 one gets an extra @xmath25 pair that has @xmath26 and does not allow the @xmath4 production upon hadronization . on the other hand in the @xmath18 decay into @xmath6 one gets an extra @xmath27 pair that could lead to the @xmath4 upon hadronization , but the process is doubly cabibbo suppressed .",
    "it is found there that a signal is seen for the @xmath2 production and only a small fraction is reported for @xmath3 production  @xcite .",
    "one should expect also a minor rate for @xmath4 production in this case and , in fact , this mode of decay is not reported .",
    "in the present case the @xmath4 production is allowed and the rates are large  @xcite . the fact that we have now weak interactions that allow for isospin violation permit that both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances are produced in the same reaction .",
    "this is a novelty with respect to strong interactions that are isospin conserving .",
    "the present weak decay presents then a new challenge since one can determine the relative weight of production of each one of these resonances in the same reaction , a new situation with respect to what one has in strong interaction reactions .",
    "the process for @xmath28 proceeds at the elementary quark level as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] ( a ) .",
    "the process is cabibbo allowed , the @xmath29 pair produces the @xmath30 , which will convert to the observed @xmath1 through time evolution with the weak interaction .",
    "the remaining @xmath31 pair gets hadronized adding an extra @xmath32 with the quantum mumbers of the vacuum , @xmath33 .",
    "this topology is the same as for the @xmath34 ( substituting the @xmath29 by @xmath35 )  @xcite , that upon hadronization of the @xmath36 pair leads to the production of the @xmath3  @xcite , which couples mostly to the hadronized @xmath37 components .     and ( b ) : hadronization of the @xmath38 to give two mesons . ]",
    "the hadronization is implemented in an easy way following the work of ref .",
    "one starts with the @xmath39 matrix @xmath40    @xmath41    which has the property @xmath42    hence the @xmath31 component of fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] ( b ) can be written as , @xmath43    next , we rewrite the @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 in terms of meson components , and we have @xmath40 corresponding to the matrix @xmath44  @xcite",
    "@xmath45    this matrix corresponds to the ordinary one used in chiral perturbation theory  @xcite with the addition of @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a singlet of @xmath16 , taking into account the standard mixing between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the term @xmath46 is omitted in the chiral lagrangians because the @xmath50 $ ] structure of the lagrangians renders this term inoperative . in ref .",
    "@xcite the ordinary @xmath44 matrix of chiral perturbation theory was also used . here",

    "( [ eq : phimatrix ] ) since we are concerned with physical @xmath48 plus @xmath51 production .",
    "hence upon hadronization of the @xmath31 component we shall have @xmath52 where we have omitted the @xmath49 term because of its large mass .",
    "this means that upon hadronization of the @xmath31 component we have @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are the different meson meson components of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiphi11 ] ) .",
    "this is only the first step , because now these mesons will interact among themselves delivering the desired meson pair component at the end : @xmath55 for the case of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath56 for the case of the @xmath4 .    the multiple scattering of the mesons is readily taken into account as shown diagrammatically in fig .

    "we should mention that in a three hadron final state one must look for the interaction of three particles , for which one must in principle deal with faddeev equations  @xcite .",
    "most of the applications of faddeev equations are done for three baryon systems but calculations for three mesons are becoming available  @xcite .",

    "is imposed on the two body systems and diagrams related to three body unitarity are evaluated perturbatively .",
    "they are found relevant close to threshold but fade away rapidly of higher energies .",
    "what we have done is in this line and we have unitarized the @xmath80 , @xmath10 ( and coupled channels pairs ) but the @xmath30 has been left as a spectator . in principle",
    "we should also look at the interaction of @xmath81 which can lead to the @xmath82 resonance  @xcite , yet the topology of fig .",
    "[ fig : mesonmesonfsi ] ( a ) does not favor @xmath14-wave interaction of @xmath83 . and",

    "@xcite , the fact that we do not consider the @xmath83 interaction ( leading to the @xmath82 ) , which would just provide a background in the @xmath80 mass distribution for the reasons discussed at the end of section ii , makes our amplitude dependent upon the invariant mass of @xmath80 or @xmath10 .    concerning the @xmath86-exchange diagrams , which we have ignored in our approach , we would like to argue in favor of its relative smallness with two arguments : firstly , in fig .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 decay into @xmath1 and a scalar resonance , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is studied obtaining the scalar resonances from final state interaction of a pair of mesons produced in a first step in the @xmath0 decay into @xmath1 and the pair of pseudoscalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> this weak decay is very appropriate for this kind of study because it allows to produce the three resonances in the same decay in a process that is cabibbo allowed , hence the rates obtained are large compared to those of @xmath5 decays into @xmath6 and a scalar meson that have at least one cabibbo suppressed vertex . concretely the @xmath4 production is cabibbo allowed here , while it can not be seen in the @xmath7 decay into @xmath8 and is doubly cabibbo suppressed in the @xmath5 decay into @xmath8 and has not been identified there . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the three resonances can be seen in the same reaction , because there is no isospin conservation in the weak decays , offers a unique opportunity to test the ideas of the chiral unitary approach where these resonances are produced from the interaction of pairs of pseudoscalar mesons . </S>"
