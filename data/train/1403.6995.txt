    "quantization is an extremely vast subject , particularly because it has a long - standing physical origin and history .",
    "even from the more restrictive point of view of a pure mathematician , quantization possesses many facets and connects with a wide variety of modern mathematical domains .",
    "this variety of interactions explains the numerous mathematical incarnations that the expression _",
    "_ finds in the existing literature , though a common denominator seems to be a _ perturbation of a commutative structure into a non - commutative structure_. for a commutative object @xmath1 ( typically a commutative algebra or a manifold ) , a quantization is most often realized as a family @xmath2 , of objects depending on a parameter @xmath3 , which recovers @xmath1 when @xmath4 and which is non - commutative for general values of @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of the family @xmath2 is in most cases related to the existence of certain additional geometric structures , such as symplectic or poisson structures .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is to present a new approach to quantization , or more specifically to the construction and the study of interesting non - commutative deformations of commutative objects of geometrico - algebraic origins .",
    "this new approach is based on the _ derived algebraic geometry _ , a version of algebraic geometry that has emerged in the last decade ( see @xcite ) , and which itself consists of a",
    "_ homotopical perturbation of algebraic geometry_. derived algebraic geometry not only leads to a unified geometric interpretation of most of the already existing quantum objects ( e.g. it treats the quantum group and deformation quantization of a poisson manifold on an equal footing ) , but also opens up a whole new world of quantum objects which , as far as we know , have not been identified in the past even though they seem to appear naturally in algebraic geometry , algebraic topology , or representation theory . + * acknowledgements : * the content of this manuscript represents works still in progress in collaboration with t. pantev , m. vaqui and g. vezzosi .",
    "the author is thankful to the three of them for numerous conversations that have helped a lot in the writting of this manuscript .",
    "an important part of the present text has been prepared during a , snowy but enjoyable , visit at yale mathematics department .",
    "a particular thanks to s. goncharov and m. kapranov for many enlightening conversations on related subjects .",
    "+ * convention : * all varieties , algebras , schemes , stacks , algebraic groups etc  will be over a ground field @xmath5 of characteristic zero .",
    "in this first section we briefly recall three well known important examples of `` quantization in action '' in different domains : quantum groups , skein algebras and donaldson - thomas invariants .",
    "we identify the natural moduli spaces behind each of these examples and explain how they all can be considered from the unified point of view of deformations of categories and monoidal categories of sheaves .",
    "+ * quantum groups . * probably the most famous and most fundamental of quantum objects are quantum groups . for an algebraic group @xmath0 , with",
    "lie algebra @xmath6 , and a choice of a @xmath0-invariant element @xmath7 , drinfeld constructs a quantum group ( see @xcite ) .",
    "algebraically the quantum group is a deformation of the hopf algebra @xmath8 of functions on @xmath0 , into a non - commutative hopf algebra @xmath9 .",
    "* skein algebras .",
    "* skein algebras appear in low dimensional topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they are associated with a given riemann surface @xmath10 , and are explicitly defined in terms of generators and relations .",
    "the generators are given by simple curves traced on the surface @xmath10 , and the relations are given by the so - called skein relations , which possess natural deformations by a parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the skein algebra associated with @xmath10 , @xmath12 , is a non - commutative deformation of the ring of functions on the character variety of @xmath10 for the group @xmath13 ( i.e. the affine algebraic variety whose points describe @xmath14-representations of the fundamental group @xmath15 ) .",
    "* donaldson - thomas invariants . * for @xmath1 a calabi - yau algebraic variety of dimension @xmath16 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the moduli space of stable vector bundles with fixed numerical invariants .",
    "it is a singular variety in general but with a very specific local structure .",
    "indeed , it is known that locally around each point , @xmath1 embeds into a smooth ambient variety @xmath18 as the critical points of a function @xmath19 .",
    "each of these locally defined functions @xmath20 define a ( perverse ) sheaf @xmath21 of vanishing cycles on @xmath1 , which under an orientability assumption glue to a globally defined perverse sheaf @xmath22 on @xmath1 ( see @xcite for more on the subject ) .",
    "the sheaf @xmath22 is a quantization of the space @xmath1 , in the sense that it can be seen to be a deformation of the line bundle of _ virtual half forms on @xmath1 _ ( we refer here to the next section for more about virtual structures ) .",
    "this deformation is again a non - commutative deformation , but this time in a dramatic way as the multiplicative structure itself is lost and @xmath22 only exists as a sheaf of ( complexes of ) vector spaces on @xmath1 .",
    "+ despite their different origins and differences in appearance these three examples of quantization can be considered in a striking unified way : they all are deformations of categories of sheaves on natural moduli spaces , where the categories eventually come equipped with monoidal structures .",
    "more is true , these deformations are all induced by the same type of structures on the corresponding moduli spaces , at least when they are appropriately viewed as derived algebraic stacks as we will explain later .",
    "the moduli spaces related to these three examples are easy to guess : they are respectively the moduli space @xmath23 of @xmath0-bundles on a point @xmath24 , the moduli space @xmath25 of @xmath14-bundles on the surface @xmath10 , and the moduli space @xmath17 of algebraic @xmath26-bundles on @xmath1 , also denoted @xmath27 . in the case of the quantum group ,",
    "there is no non - trivial @xmath0-bundles on a point , but the trivial @xmath0-bundle possesses many automorphisms .",
    "the moduli space @xmath23 is thus trivial from the point of view of algebraic varieties but can be realized as a non - trivial algebraic stack @xmath28 .",
    "quasi - coherent sheaves on @xmath28 are nothing else than linear representations of @xmath0 , @xmath29 .",
    "the quantum group @xmath9 can then be realized as a deformation of @xmath30 considered as a braided monoidal category . for the case of skein algebras",
    ", we already mentioned that @xmath31 is the ring of functions on the moduli space @xmath32 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath25 is an affine algebraic variety and thus its category of quasi - coherent sheaves is equivalent to modules over its ring of functions , @xmath33 .",
    "the deformation @xmath12 can thus be realized as a deformation of the category @xmath34 , simply considered as a linear category .",
    "finally , the perverse sheaf @xmath22 on @xmath17 can itself be considered as a deformation of a natural object @xmath35 , of _ virtual half top forms on @xmath1 _ , which is almost a quasi - coherent sheaf on @xmath1 ( it is a complex of such ) .",
    "the quantized object @xmath22 is thus not a deformation of @xmath36 , but is rather a deformation of one of its objects .",
    "to summarize , all of the three examples discussed above have an interpretation in terms of deformations of categories , possibly with monoidal structures , of quasi - coherent sheaves on certain moduli spaces .",
    "monoidal categories can be organized in a hierarchy , corresponding to the degree of symmetry imposed on the monoidal structure .",
    "for instance , a monoidal category can come equipped with a braiding , or a symmetry constraint .",
    "monoidal categories will be referred to as @xmath37-fold monoidal categories , braided monoidal categories as @xmath38-fold monoidal categories , and symmetric monoidal categories as @xmath39-fold monoidal categories .",
    "we will moreover see that when categories are replaced by @xmath39-categories there is a notion of @xmath40-fold monoidal @xmath39-categories for @xmath41 ( also called @xmath42-monoidal @xmath39-categories ) , interpolating between braided and symmetric monoidal categories .",
    "when @xmath43 , a @xmath44-fold category can be defined to simply be a category , a @xmath45-monoidal category can be declared to be an object in a category , and a @xmath46-monoidal category can be defined as an endomorphism of an object in a category .",
    "this hierarchy is rather standard in the setting of higher category theory in which a monoidal category is often considered as a 2-category with a unique object , and a braided monoidal categories as a 3-category with unique object and unique @xmath37-morphism ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in our examples",
    "above , quantum groups are deformations of @xmath47 as a 2-fold monoidal category .",
    "skein algebras are deformations of @xmath34 as @xmath44-fold monoidal categories . finally , the perverse sheaf @xmath22 is a deformation of @xmath48 considered as @xmath45-fold monoidal category .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explain that this is only a very small part of a bigger coherent picture , which we present here as a key principle .",
    "[ princ ] for any oriented manifold of dimension @xmath49 ( understood either in the topological or in the algebraic sense ) , and any reductive group @xmath0 , the moduli space of @xmath0-bundles on @xmath1 , @xmath50 , possesses a quantization which is a deformation of @xmath51 considered as an @xmath52-fold monoidal @xmath39-category .",
    "we will see how this principle can becomes a theorem , after a suitable interpretation of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and a suitable understanding of @xmath52-fold monoidal structures .",
    "we will also see how this principle follows from the general framework of symplectic and poisson structures in derived algebraic geometry , and a general quantization procedure .",
    "the concept of an algebraic variety is not quite enough to encompass all the aspects of the moduli problems appearing in algebraic geometry . starting in the 50 and continuing until this day",
    ", several successive generalizations of algebraic varieties were introduced in order to understand more and more refined aspects of moduli spaces . as a first step nilpotent functions",
    "have been allowed as it is well known that many interesting moduli spaces are non - reduced and must be considered as schemes instead of algebraic varieties .",
    "secondly algebraic stacks have been introduced in order to take into account the fact that in most examples , moduli spaces classify objects only up to isomorphisms , and in many situations non - trivial automorphisms prevent the existence of any reasonable moduli spaces .",
    "unfortunately algebraic stacks are still not enough to capture all aspects of moduli problems , as even though they see non - trivial automorphisms the so - called _ higher structures _ remain invisible .",
    "we will explain in this section what the higher structures are and how the notion of _ derived algebraic stacks _ is needed in order to incorporate them as part of the refined moduli space .      a first type of higher structure concerns _ higher homotopies _ , which appear naturally each time objects are classified not only up to isomorphism but up to a weaker notion of _ equivalences_. a typical example is the extension of the moduli space of vector bundles on a given smooth and projective algebraic variety @xmath1 , by also allowing complexes of vector bundles , now considered up to quasi - isomorphism must be considered . ] .",
    "the moduli space of vector bundles on @xmath1 can be realized as an algebraic stack , but the moduli of complexes of vector bundles taken up to quasi - isomorphism can not be represented by an algebraic stack in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is the existence of higher homotopies between maps between complexes , which is reflected in the fact that a complex @xmath53 on @xmath1 can have non - trivial negative self extension groups @xmath54 .",
    "the vector spaces @xmath54 for @xmath55 are higher analogues of automorphism groups of vector bundles and their existence prevent the representability by an algebraic stack for the exact same reason that the existence of non - trivial automorphisms of vector bundles prevent the representability of the moduli problem of vector bundles on @xmath1 by a scheme . in his manuscript `` pursuing stacks '' , a. grothendieck brought forward the idea of _ higher stack _ , which is an extension of the notion of stacks of groupoids usually considered in moduli theory to a higher categorical or higher homotopical setting .",
    "this idea has been made concrete in @xcite by the introduction of a notion of _ algebraic @xmath40-stacks _ ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these algebraic @xmath40-stacks behave in a very similar way to algebraic stacks , and most of the standard notions and techniques of algebraic geometry remain valid in this new setting ( they have derived categories , cohomology , tangent spaces , dimensions  ) .",
    "fundamental examples of algebraic @xmath40-stacks include the eilenberg - mclane stacks of the form @xmath56 , for @xmath57 a commutative algebraic group , which are higher analogues of classifying stacks @xmath28 .",
    "another important example for us are the so - called linear stacks : for a scheme @xmath1 and a complex of vector bundles @xmath58 on @xmath1 concentrated in degrees @xmath59 $ ] , there is a linear stack @xmath60 , which is a generalization of the total space of a vector bundle .",
    "finally , for @xmath1 a smooth and projective variety , there is an algebraic @xmath40-stack of complexes of vector bundles on @xmath1 , which also possesses many possible non - commutative generalizations ( see @xcite for more on the subject ) .",
    "a second type of higher structure attached to moduli problems is called the _",
    "derived structure_. these derived structures are somehow dual to the higher homotopies we have just mentioned and exist even in absence of any stacky phenomenon ( i.e. even when there are no non - trivial automorphisms ) .",
    "they have been introduced through the eye of deformation theory and originally were only considered at the formal level of moduli spaces . the _ derived deformation theory _",
    ", also referred to as ddt , is a collection of ideas going back to the 80 s , stipulating that moduli spaces , formally around a given fixed point , can be described in terms of mauer - cartan elements in a suitable dg - lie algebra associated to this point .",
    "the most famous example is the deformation theory of a given smooth projective variety @xmath1 , for which the natural dg - lie algebra is @xmath61 , the cochain complex computing the cohomology of the tangent sheaf , endowed with its dg - lie structure coming from the bracket of vector fields .",
    "this example is not special , and in fact all possible moduli problems come with natural dg - lie algebras describing their formal completions . +",
    "a striking consequence of the ddt is the existence of _ virtual sheaves _ on moduli spaces . indeed , according to the ddt , for a point @xmath62 in some moduli space @xmath63 , we can find a dg - lie algebra @xmath64 controlling the formal local ring of @xmath63 at @xmath65 .",
    "there is moreover an explicit formula reconstructing formal functions at @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67)$ ] is the ( completed ) chevalley complex of @xmath64 , which also computes the cohomology of @xmath5 considered as a the trivial @xmath64-module .",
    "an important observation is that the chevalley complex @xmath68 is a commutative dg - algebra which can have non trivial cohomology in non - positive degrees .",
    "these cohomology groups , @xmath69 for @xmath70 , provide non - trivial coherent sheaves over the formal neighborhood of @xmath65 , which are by definition the _ derived structures of @xmath63 around @xmath65_. these local coherent sheaves are quite important , as they control for instance the smoothness defect of the moduli space @xmath63 , and lead to the so - called virtual fundamental class ( see @xcite ) .",
    "incorporating these higher structures as an intrinsic part of the moduli space itself has lead to the theory of _ derived algebraic geometry _ , and to introduction of _ derived schemes _ and _ derived algebraic ( @xmath71)stacks _ as the correct geometrico - algebraic notion to fully represent moduli problems in algebraic geometry .",
    "the foundations of the theory of derived algebraic geometry can be found in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". we will not give precise definitions here , as the details easily become technical , and will rather concentrate on some basic definitions and basic facts .",
    "as objects derived schemes are rather easy to define and understand .",
    "we display below one possible definition of derived schemes ( specific to the characteristic zero case , recall that everything is over a base field @xmath5 of zero characteristic ) .",
    "[ dsch ] a _ derived scheme _",
    "( over the field @xmath5 ) consists of a pair @xmath72 , where @xmath1 is a topological space and @xmath73 is a sheaf of commutative differential graded @xmath5-algebras on @xmath1 , satisfying the following conditions .    * the sheaves @xmath74 vanish for @xmath55 . *",
    "the ringed space @xmath75 is a @xmath5-scheme .",
    "* for all @xmath76 , @xmath74 , considered as a sheaf of @xmath77-modules , is a quasi - coherent sheaf .",
    "the above definition makes derived schemes look as rather simple objects , but things get more sophisticated when morphisms between derived schemes are introduced .",
    "the sheaf of dg - algebras @xmath73 must only be considered up to quasi - isomorphisms , and quasi - isomorphic derived schemes have to be considered as equivalent .",
    "therefore , there is a _ derived category of derived schemes _ , which is non - linear analogue of the derived category of a ring , and for which quasi - isomorphic sheaves of dg - algebras define the same derived scheme .",
    "there are two possible constructions of the category of derived schemes , a first one relies on model category structures and includes the quasi - isomorphisms as the weak equivalences of a certain model category . a more modern approach ,",
    "powerful in practice but more demanding in terms of foundations , is to use @xmath39-categories , and to define the category of derived schemes directly as an @xmath39-category ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "concretely this means that morphisms between two given derived schemes do not form a set anymore but are topological spaces , or a simplicial sets .",
    "this allows to consider homotopies between morphisms of derived schemes , and thus to define equivalences between derived schemes as morphisms having inverses up to homotopy .",
    "the @xmath78-category @xmath79 of derived schemes is then defined so that quasi - isomorphisms become homotopy equivalences in @xmath79 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on these two approaches , and we will consider @xmath79 as an @xmath78-category in what follows .    there have been a certain number of works on the notion of derived schemes , making many of the basic aspects of scheme theory available in the derived setting .",
    "derived schemes behave in a very similar fashion to schemes , they have a notion of ( quasi - coherent ) sheaves , cohomology , smooth , flat and tale maps etc  .",
    "special among the derived schemes are the affine derived schemes , which are completely characterized by their functions , which themselves form a non - positively graded cdga .",
    "there is a @xmath80 construction , sending a cdga @xmath57 to an affine derived scheme @xmath81 , whose underlying space is @xmath82 and whose structure sheaf is given by the various localizations @xmath83 $ ] in a very similar manner as for un - derived schemes . the @xmath80 functor produces a full embedding of the ( opposite ) @xmath78-category of cdga into @xmath79 . here the @xmath78-category of cdga can be presented concretely as the category whose objects are quasi - free cdga together with the standard simplicial sets of morphisms @xmath84-simplicies is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the algebraic de rham complex of the algebraic @xmath40-dimensional simplex @xmath87 . ] .",
    "a general derived scheme @xmath1 is locally equivalent to @xmath81 for some cdga @xmath57 , and many of the notions defined for cdga can be extended to arbitrary derived scheme by sheafification .",
    "this is for instance the case for the notions of smooth , flat and tale maps , as well as for the notion of cotangent complexes of derived schemes , etc .",
    "the reader should have already guessed that derived schemes are not quite enough for our purpose and that we will need the notion of derived algebraic stacks ( including derived higher stacks in some cases ) .",
    "these are defined in a similar fashion as algebraic stacks and higher algebraic stacks ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in a nutshell a derived algebraic stack is given by a quotient of a derived scheme @xmath1 by an action of a smooth groupoid .",
    "concretely a derived algebraic stack is associated to a simplicial object @xmath88 made of derived schemes satisfying some smooth kan lifting conditions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a typical example is the action of an algebraic group @xmath0 on a derived scheme @xmath89 , for which the simplicial objects is the standard nerve of the action @xmath90",
    "\\in \\delta ) \\mapsto y\\times g^{n},$ ] where the face maps are defined by the action of @xmath0 on @xmath89 and the multiplication on @xmath0 , and the degeneracies are induced by the unit in @xmath0 .",
    "the derived algebraic stack obtained this way will be denoted by @xmath91 $ ] , and it should be noted that already some interesting derived algebraic stacks are of this form ( but these are not enough to represent all moduli problems ) .",
    "derived algebraic stacks are good objects to do algebraic geometry with , and many of the standard notions and results known for underived algebraic stacks can be extended to the derived setting .",
    "one construction of fundamental importance for us is the ( dg-)category ( see @xcite ) of quasi - coherent complexes on a given derived algebraic stack . for an",
    "affine derived scheme @xmath92 , the quasi - coherent complexes over @xmath1 are declared to be the @xmath57-dg - modules .",
    "the @xmath57-dg - modules form a nice @xmath5-linear dg - category @xmath93 , for which one explicit model consists of the dg - category of quasi - free @xmath57-dg - modules . for a general derived algebraic stack @xmath1 the dg - category of quasi - coherent complexes",
    "is defined by approximating @xmath1 by affine derived schemes @xmath94 where the limit is taken inside a suitable @xmath78-category of dg - categories ( see @xcite ) , or equivalently is understood as a homotopy limit inside the homotopy theory of dg - categories of @xcite .",
    "another important notion we will use is the cotangent complex .",
    "any derived algebraic stack possesses a canonically defined object @xmath95 , which is the derived version of the sheaf of kalher 1-forms .",
    "when @xmath1 is a smooth scheme then @xmath96 is the vector bundle @xmath97 considered as an object in the quasi - coherent derived category of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath92 is an affine derived scheme , @xmath98 is the @xmath57-dg - module representing the so - called andr - quillen homology , and can be defined as the left derived functor of @xmath99 . for a scheme @xmath1 , @xmath96 coincides with illusie s cotangent complex . for a general derived algebraic stack @xmath1 the cotangent complex @xmath100",
    "is obtained by gluing the cotangent complexes of each stage in a simplicial presentation , but can also be characterized by a universal property involving square zero extensions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dual object @xmath101 is called the tangent complex of @xmath1 and is a derived version of the sheaf of derivations .    to finish with general facts about derived algebraic stacks",
