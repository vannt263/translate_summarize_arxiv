    "classical mathematical models of biological or chemical pattern formation have been developed using reaction - diffusion equations , see eg . @xcite and references therein . in that framework there",
    "exist essentially two mechanisms of formation of stable spatially heterogeneous structures ,    * diffusion - driven instability ( ddi ) which leads to destabilization of a spatially homogeneous steady state and emergence of turing patterns , * a mechanism based on the multistability and hysteresis in the kinetic system which allows for the formation of transition layer patterns far from equilibrium .",
    "both mechanisms can also coexist yielding a complex dynamics of the system as , for example , in the lengyel - epstein model of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the turing phenomenon is related to a local behavior of solutions of a reaction - diffusion system in the neighborhood of a constant solution that is destabilized via diffusion .",
    "patterns arising through a bifurcation can be spatially monotone or spatially periodic .",
    "the mechanism responsible for such behavior of model solutions is called a diffusion - driven instability ( turing - type instability ) , which can be formulated in the following way .",
    "a system of reaction - diffusion equations exhibits ddi ( turing instability ) if and only if there exists a constant stationary solution which is stable to spatially homogeneous perturbations , but unstable to spatially heterogeneous perturbations .",
    "the original idea was presented by turing on the example of two linear reaction - diffusion equations @xcite . due to the local character of turing instability",
    ", the notion has been extended in a natural way to the nonlinear equations using linearization around a constant positive steady state",
    ". however , nonlinear systems may have multiple constant steady states yielding existence of heterogeneous structures far from the equilibrium .",
    "in such cases , global behavior of the solutions can not be predicted by the properties of the linearized system and a variety of possible dynamics depending on the type of nonlinearities can be observed . on the other hand ,",
    "turing instability can be exhibited also in degenerated systems such as reaction - diffusion - odes models or integro - differential equations , for example shadow systems obtained through reduction of the reaction - diffusion model , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "following all these observations and the character of turing s original system , we define turing patterns in the following way .    by turing patterns we call the solutions of reaction - diffusion equations that are    * stable , * stationary , * continuous , * spatially heterogeneous and * arise due to the turing instability ( ddi ) of a constant steady state .",
    "recently , it has been shown that if ddi property is exhibited by a system of a single reaction - diffusion equation coupled to an ordinary differential equation with autocatalysis of non - diffusing component .",
    "then , it does not lead to turing patterns , namely all continuous patterns are unstable @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the question for the long - term behavior of solutions arises .",
    "it has been previously shown that a diffusion - driven blow - up in systems of reaction - diffusion equations can occur in finite time , @xcite .",
    "even more , blow - up in finite time in @xmath0 , but global existence of weaker solutions has been shown , leading to so called `` incomplete blow - up '' , see e.g. @xcite for uniform boundedness in @xmath1 .",
    "in the current paper we present a phenomenon of diffusion - driven unbounded growth and formation of dynamic spike pattern converging asymptotically to a sum of dirac deltas . for a reaction - diffusion - ode model arising from applications in biology ,",
    "we show that introducing diffusion in the odes system not only destabilizes the constant steady state , but also leads to an unbounded growth of model solutions . since the solutions of the system with zero diffusion are uniformly bounded , we call the observed phenomenon the _ diffusion - driven unbounded growth_. the total mass ( @xmath1 norm ) of the solutions is uniformly bounded but it concentrates in isolated points for time tending to infinity . using numerical simulations , we investigate how the shape of emerging patterns depends on initial conditions and the scaling coefficient ( size of diffusion versus domain size ) .",
    "interestingly , we find out that the shape of observed patterns are superposition of a near - equilibrium effect of diffusion - driven instability and a far - from - equilibrium effect of multistability exhibited by the model .",
    "we study a reaction - diffusion - odes model of the diffusion - regulated growth of cell population , which has the form of two ordinary - partial differential equations @xmath2 , \\ ; t>0 , \\label{eq1-qs}\\\\ w_t & = d_w w_{xx } - w - u^2 w + \\kappa_1   & \\text{for}\\ x\\in ( 0,1 ) , \\ ; t>0 , \\label{eq2-qs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] supplemented with homogeneous neumann ( zero flux ) boundary conditions for the function @xmath3 @xmath4 and with nonnegative initial conditions @xmath5 @xmath6 denote positive constants .",
    "+ in this paper we focus on one - dimensional domain @xmath7 $ ] for a clarity of presentation .",
    "the results can be obtained also for a model defined on two - dimensional space domain .",
    "obviously , in such case a structure of spatial patterns is richer .",
    "nevertheless , the main aspect of the pattern formation phenomenon exhibited by this model , i.e. evolution of spike patterns of mass concentration , is preserved independent on the dimension of the spatial domain .",

    "the reduction was proposed in @xcite , but without further numerical or analytical investigation .",
    "+ in case of the spatial domain being the unit square , approximation of solutions of model - have been performed in @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the models showed qualitatively new patterns of behavior of solutions , including , in some cases , a strong dependence of the emerging pattern on initial conditions and quasi - stability followed by rapid growth of solutions .",
    "however , recently it has been shown using linear stability analysis of nonconstant steady states that all stationary solutions of this model , both continuous and discontinuous , are unstable @xcite .",
    "a question arises if the model exhibits a formation of any pattern , which persist for long times .",
    "our present research is focused on understating these phenomena and answering questions on pattern formation in such class of models .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we consider the system - . it has been obtained using a quasi - stationary approximation assuming that the dynamics of @xmath9 variable is faster than the dynamics of other variables . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the reduced model , since it is the simplest reaction - diffusion - ode model exhibiting the spike pattern formation mechanism . a rigorous link between the solutions of the original model - and",
    "its two - equations approximation has been recently shown in @xcite .",
    "existence of global , classical solutions can be proven within the framework of ordinary differential equations and the theory of linear semigroups , see e.g. @xcite .",
