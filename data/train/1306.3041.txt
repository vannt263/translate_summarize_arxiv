    "parity - violating electron scattering process , extensively investigated since more than a decade , has been proven to offer a unique experimental opportunity in probing the contribution of the strangeness sea to the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon . during that period ,",
    "results from four collaborations have been released in several publications ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) with the latest ones for each of the collaborations being : sample ( mit - bates )  @xcite , pva4 ( mami )  @xcite , g0 ( jlab )  @xcite , happex ( jlab )  @xcite . those experiments allowed extracting linear combinations of electric ( @xmath8 ) and magnetic ( @xmath1 ) strangeness form factors of the proton as a function of four - vector momentum transfer @xmath9 .",
    "a general trend of the data published before year 2009 was to produce rather small and positive values for @xmath2 , especially in the range @xmath10 0.1 to 0.5 ( gev / c)@xmath4 ; see e.g. table i in ref .  @xcite . in this latter work",
    "a global analysis of world data of parity - violating electron scattering was performed for @xmath11 ( gev / c)@xmath4 and led to @xmath12 nuclear magneton ( @xmath13 ) . another low @xmath9 global analysis",
    "@xcite disfavored negative @xmath1 , and still a third one  @xcite , dedicated to the range @xmath14 0.5 to 1.0 ( gev / c)@xmath4 produced two sets of solutions with opposite signs .",
    "on the theoretical side , the strangeness contributions to the magnetic moment of the proton have also been intensively investigated .",
    "few approaches have produced results close to the data , with positive sign , such as heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , quenched chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , chiral quark - soliton model  @xcite , skyrme model  @xcite , and constituent quark models  @xcite .",
    "however , a large number of theoretical results predicted negative values , notably , meson cloud model  @xcite , chiral quark model  @xcite , and unquenched constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable issue is that the lattice - qcd approaches  @xcite have kept predicting negative strangeness magnetic moment for the proton .",
    "note that in various works prior to the advent of the first data , the general trend was predicting negative sign for the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton @xmath0 , as reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in 2009 ,",
    "the pva4 collaboration  @xcite , obtained for the first time a negative sign value @xmath15 ; units are ( gev / c)@xmath4 for @xmath9 and nuclear magnetons for @xmath1 .",
    "more recently the happex collaboration  @xcite reported a small but also negative sign at higher @xmath9 , namely , @xmath16 .",
    "the present work is motivated by interpreting the recent data  @xcite on @xmath2 within an extended chiral constituent quark model ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "our starting point was the idea put forward by zou and riska  @xcite according to which the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton could be explained by including five - quark fock components in the proton wave function .",
    "they showed that a positive strangeness magnetic moment of the proton can rise from the @xmath18 being in the ground state and the four - quark subsystem @xmath19 in the @xmath20-state , while @xmath18 in the @xmath20-state and the four - quarks in their ground state would lead to a negative value for @xmath0 .",
    "then that approach was developed and extended to the strangeness contributions to spin of the proton  @xcite , magnetic moments of baryons  @xcite , electromagnetic and strong decays of baryon resonances  @xcite .",
    "the main outcome of those studies is that the higher fock components play important roles in describing the properties of baryons and their resonances .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite only contributions from the diagonal matrix elements @xmath21 were included , while the non - diagonal transition between three - quark and strangeness components of the proton @xmath22 also contributes .",
    "in fact , the diagonal contributions are proportional to the probability of corresponding strangeness component @xmath23 , but the non - diagonal contributions are proportional to the product of probability amplitudes of three- and five - quark components @xmath24 .",
    "generally , the latter is more significant than the former , given that the proton is mainly composed of three - quark component . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the non - diagonal contributions were taken into account , but on the one hand , only the lowest strangeness component , with the four - quark subsystem in the p - state was considered , and on the other hand , the probability amplitudes for strangeness components in the proton were treated as free parameters in order to obtain a positive value for @xmath0 .",
    "in the present work , the probability amplitudes , a crucial ingredient in the extended chiral constituent quark model , are calculated within the most commonly accepted @xmath25 pair creation mechanism , namely , the @xmath26 model .",
    "then , the @xmath25 pair is created anywhere in space with the quantum numbers of the qcd vacuum @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to the decay of mesons and baryons  @xcite , and has recently been employed to analyze the sea flavor content of the ground states of the @xmath28 octet baryons  @xcite .",
    "note that in the @xmath28 symmetric case , the ratio of probabilities for five - quark components with strange and light quark - antiquark pairs is @xmath29  @xcite , while by taking into account the @xmath28 symmetry breaking effects , we determined  @xcite that ratio to be @xmath30 and putting @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we calculate both diagonal and non - diagonal terms for all relevant five - quark configurations and removed contributions from the center - of - mass motion of the quark clusters , as emphasized recently  @xcite .",
    "finally , we underline that all of the input parameters are taken consistently from the literature .    the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : frame ] , we present our theoretical framework , which includes the wave function and the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton within our extended constituent quark model . our numerical results for the strangeness magnetic moment and form factor of the proton are reported in section [ sec : result ] , where we give the input parameters , discuss the role of various ingredients of our approach and proceed to comparisons with findings by other authors .",
    "finally , section [ sec : end ] contains summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we first briefly review the method to derive the wave function of the proton in the extended chiral constituent quark model ( sec  [ sec : wfn ] ) , and then present the formalism for the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton ( sec  [ sec : smm ] ) .      in our extended chiral constituent quark model",

    "the three combinations between @xmath112 and @xmath111 studied gave results consistent with the available data in 2006 . however , out of the twelve configurations ( table  [ nsmm ] ) only @xmath113_{x}[4]_{fs}[22]_{f}[22]_{s}$ ] was considered . that configuration was also used in refs .",

    "the extended chiral constituent quark model offers an appropriate frame to study the possible manifestations of genuine five - quark components in baryons .",
    "the present work is in line with our earlier efforts  @xcite in that realm .",
    "there are several difficulties in this endeavor : few observables have been identified carrying information on higher fock states , the data are scarce and often bear large uncertainties due to the smallness of the effects looked for",
    ". moreover , there are input parameters in the approach , which basically should be taken from literature and exceptionally fitted on the data under consideration .",
    "accordingly , we took advantage of the data on radiative and strong decays of the @xmath120 resonance  @xcite , strong decay of low - lying @xmath121 and @xmath122 nucleon resonances  @xcite , and sea flavor content of octet baryons  @xcite to deepen our understanding of the five - quark components and select a coherent set of input parameters .",

    "based on the above observations , it becomes then obvious that using severely truncated configuration sets and/or unrealistic values for @xmath111 or @xmath112 will lead to unreliable results with respect to the magnetic moment and/or magnetic form factor of the proton .",
    "the uncertainties associated to the available data on the one hand , and those of lqcd approaches on the other hand , do not allow us making a sharp choice between the results coming from the two sets in terms of the ratio @xmath112 .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton and its magnetic form factor are small and negative . between the two sets ,",
    "set  ii appears to be slightly favored by findings from other sources .",
    "accordingly , we get @xmath124 and the magnitude of the strangeness magnetic from factor of the proton evolves smoothly with increasing transfer momentum to reach @xmath125 at @xmath126 ( gev / c)@xmath4 .    awaited for data at @xmath127 ( gev / c)@xmath4 expected to be released by the pva4 collaboration  @xcite and more advanced lqcd approaches will hopefully improve the accuracy of the experimental and theoretical data bases .",
    "recent convergence between theory and experiment on the negative sign of that observable and its smallness , might also initiate new dedicated measurements .",
