    "in - medium properties of hadrons are of fundamental interest with respect to an understanding of qcd in the non - perturbative regime ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . during the past decade especially the properties of vector mesons have found widespread attention as they may be related to chiral symmetry .",
    "a comparison of experimental data on dilepton production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at sps energies @xcite with transport theoretical calculations @xcite seems to indicate a lowering of the @xmath3-meson mass in the nuclear medium .",
    "however , since in a heavy ion collision the final dilepton yield is obtained by an integration over dileptons emitted at different densities and temperatures a discrimination between different scenarios of in - medium modifications for the vector mesons is difficult @xcite",
    ".    moreover , there is a more fundamental concern : ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions proceed , at least in their initial stages , far from equilibrium , whereas all theoretical predictions of in - medium properties are based on equilibrium assumptions .",
    "therefore it is necessary to probe in - medium properties of vector mesons under cleaner conditions . for that purpose photon or",
    "pion induced reactions are promising tools . in such reactions",
    "the nuclear medium is very close to equilibrium at normal nuclear density and temperature zero .",
    "the predicted in - medium effects for the vector mesons are so large that they should have observable consequences already for densities @xmath5 . here",
    "one should note that even the dileptons seen in ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions stem to a large part from densities @xmath6 .",
    "our calculations are based on a semi - classical buu transport model that has recently been very successfully applied to the description of heavy ion collisions at sis energies @xcite and photoproduction of pions and etas in nuclei @xcite .",
    "meanwhile we have extended the model to the description of dilepton as well as strangeness production and to the high energy regime by including the lund string fragmentation model fritiof @xcite .",
    "this allows us to calculate inclusive particle production in heavy ion collisions from 200 amev to 200 agev , in photon and in pion induced reactions with the very same physical input . to our opinion ,",
    "the simultaneous description of as many experimental observables as possible is necessary because of the large number of parameters , like unknown cross sections , and the strong assumptions that enter semi - classical transport models . in heavy - ion collisions",
    "particle production depends not only on a large number of elementary reaction channels but also on the global space - time evolution of the system . on the other hand photon , pion or proton induced reactions allow to fix certain ingredients of the transport model as observables depend in general only on a few reaction channels . in ref .",

    "however , in our model we treat real and imaginary part of the self - energies completely independently .",
    "this violates analyticity , but in the present stage it would already require a considerable effort to treat the imaginary parts of all particles in a realistic transport model in a completely self - consistent way .    in ref .  @xcite it has recently been stressed that , because of unitarity , it is important to respect eq .",

    "@xcite such effects might give large modifications of the baryon widths and also influence the spectral function of the @xmath3-meson .",
    "however , an inclusion of such effects would enhance the numerical effort dramatically , especially if one takes also the modifications of the real parts of the self - energies into account .",
    "moreover , we do not expect such effects to be relevant for photon energies above 1 gev because here the nucleon resonances that lie below @xmath125 and might thus get strongly modified , like the @xmath78 , play only a minor role .",

    "( [ transport ] ) do not yet give the correct asymptotic spectral phase space densities for particles that are stable in vacuum .",
    "this can be seen by noting that a collision broadened particle does not automatically lose its collisional width when being propagated out of the nuclear environment .",
    "the same problem appears for resonances whose imaginary part of the self - energy is non - zero in - medium in kinematical regimes where it is zero in vacuum .",
    "the reason for this deficiency is directly related to the semi - classical approximations on which the transport equation eq .  ( [ transport ] ) is based , in particular the neglect of coherence effects . however ,",
    "since a realistic quantum transport theory is numerically not yet realizable we will nevertheless work with eq .",
    "( [ transport ] ) as it is certainly a step beyond the usual on - shell approximation .",
    "moreover , if the time evolution of the system is such that the rate of particle production and absorption is much larger than the change of the width with time the problem with surviving off - shell contributions will be negligible . under the assumption that the gain term in the collision term is in magnitude comparable to the loss term",
    "we can formulate this in the following way : @xmath126 in case of a particle moving in a static nuclear medium with density profile @xmath127 we can rewrite this condition : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a unit vector along the momentum direction of the particle and @xmath130 denotes its mean free path .",

    "one observes a strong broadening of the @xmath4-peak which is partly covered up by the inclusion of a mass resolution of 10 mev .",
    "however , such a strong broadening is not realistic because most of the @xmath4-mesons that contribute to the dilepton spectrum decay in the vacuum .",
    "this is also reflected by the violation of the condition eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) for the validity of our off - shell transport equation in this case .      in the following",
    "we want to discuss a prescription that allow us to obtain a divergence free @xmath3-meson and a reasonable @xmath4-meson contribution . for that purpose",
    "we introduce a potential that shifts a particle to its vacuum spectral function when it propagates to the vacuum .",
    "such a potential can not be defined on the level of the transport equation eq .",
    "( [ transport ] ) .",
    "however , we can introduce such a potential on the level of our numerical realization .",
    "we recall that we solve the transport equation by a so - called test particle method , i.e. we make an ansatz for the spectral phase space density @xmath208 : @xmath209 where @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 denote the spatial coordinate , the momentum and the mass of the test particle @xmath55 , respectively .",

    "the potential @xmath213 enters into the test particle propagation as a usual potential and therefore guarantees that this prescription does not violate energy conservation .",
    "the potential eq .",
    "( [ scalp ] ) can assume rather large values in the case of broad resonances even if the in - medium corrections are small .",
    "its effect is , nevertheless , in this case negligible . as a check",
    "we have performed a calculation of photoproduction of @xmath3-mesons in which we distributed the masses @xmath215 according to the vacuum spectral function .",
    "this gave practically the same result as the calculation without potential since the lifetime of the @xmath3-mesons is so short that only very few propagate through a relevant density gradient for which the potential becomes important .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8gam ] we show the results of our calculations with the described prescription for the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 mesons ( curves labelled propagation to bare mass , dashed lines ) . for the @xmath3-meson",
    "the divergence at the two - pion threshold is removed . for invariant masses above 500 mev we get practically the same result as without the prescription because of the reason described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath4-peak is reduced because now only the @xmath4-mesons that decay inside the nucleus contribute to the broadening .",
    "another possibility to overcome the problems with the transport theoretical treatment of broad resonances is to avoid their explicit propagation .",
    "therefore we have also performed simulations in which we calculated the cross sections for elementary dilepton production via vector mesons as instantaneous one - step processes .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8gam ] by the curves labelled instantaneous decay ( dot - dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the @xmath3-meson contribution is almost identical to the one calculated with the prescription described above because of its very short life time . for the @xmath4-meson",
    "we get a reduction by about a factor of 3 since in the instantaneous decay scheme we neglect the possibility that an @xmath4-meson can escape from the nucleus and then contribute to dilepton production with a much larger branching ratio than inside the nucleus . as such dynamical effects are important to take into account",
    "we consider the description via an instantaneous process to be inadequate .",
    "the easiest way to cope with the divergence of the @xmath3-meson contribution is to use a minimum two - pion decay width . in fig .",
    "[ fig8gam ] we show the result of a calculation where we set this minimum width to 10 mev ( dotted line ) .",
    "one sees that still a large peak remains . moreover , this approach is in any case questionable .    for the reasons described above",
    "we consider the prescription propagation to bare mass as the only possibilty to implement collision broadening effects in our calculations .",
    "however , we want to stress that this prescription is not fully satisfactory since it is only formulated on the level of our specific numerical solution of the transport equation and since it neglects any memory effects .      in order to explore the observable consequences of vector meson mass shifts at finite nuclear density",
    "the in - medium vector meson masses are modeled according to brown / rho scaling @xcite or hatsuda and lee by introducing a scalar potential @xmath223 : @xmath224 where @xmath127 is the nuclear density , @xmath225 the pole mass of the vector meson , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the real part of the in - medium @xmath3-meson self energy increases with momentum and crosses zero for a momentum of about 1 gev . in order to explore the implications of such a behaviour we also use a momentum dependent scalar potential @xmath232 for the vector mesons : @xmath233 in our calculations",
    "we take the vector meson potentials into account for the calculation of the phase space factors in @xmath234 ( eq .  ( [ gamnv ] ) ) and @xmath235 ( eq .  ( [ gamnv2 ] ) ) .",
    "we neglect these modifications for the vector meson production in the string fragmentation model fritiof and also do not modify the @xmath28-widths of the baryonic resonances .      in fig .",

    "the height of the peak around the vacuum pole mass of the @xmath4-meson is hardly affected by the dropping mass scenario . on the one hand",
    "the lowering of the mass reduces the vacuum peak because @xmath4-mesons decaying inside the nucleus contribute to lower masses . on the other hand the total production of @xmath4-mesons",

    "gets completely washed out ( dotted line ) .",
    "the dilepton yield at intermediate masses is about a factor of 2 larger than in the bare mass case . at the two - pion threshold",
    "there is a visible discontinuity which results from our neglect of @xmath3-mesons with effective masses below the two - pion mass .",
    "using the momentum dependent scalar potential from eq .",
    "( [ mompot ] ) we obtain the curves labelled momentum dependent potential ( dot - dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the result is very close to the bare mass case as the vector mesons are mainly produced with momenta around 1  gev for which the potential is zero .    in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig10gam ] we show that the effect of a dropping vector meson mass at a photon energy of 2.2 gev is qualitatively the same as for 1.5 gev .",
    "the calculation with a momentum dependent potential gives again a result that is practically the same as for the bare mass case .    in photonuclear reactions vector mesons are in general produced with larger momenta relative to the nuclear medium than in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "since the in - medium spectral functions of the vector mesons are momentum dependent one might thus observe rather different in - medium effects in both reactions .",
    "these , together with additional information from pion - nucleus and proton - nucleus reactions @xcite , might help to discriminate between different scenarios of medium modifications .",
    "therefore a calculation of all reactions within one model is necessary for a conclusive interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "our buu transport model provides such a tool .",
    "we have studied @xmath0 production in @xmath2c , @xmath2ca , and @xmath2pb reactions at photon energies of 0.8 , 1.5 , and 2.2 gev within a semi - classical transport model .",
    "various contributions were taken into account for dilepton production : dalitz decays of @xmath119 , @xmath161 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 as well as direct dilepton decays of the vectors mesons @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath148 .",
    "we have focused on observable effects of in - medium modifications of the vector mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown that the bethe - heitler process which dominates all integrated cross sections for dilepton production can be sufficiently suppressed by appropriate cuts on the lepton momenta .",
