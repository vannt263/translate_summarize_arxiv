    "for example , the best limits on @xmath0-odd forces have been obtained from the measurements of the atomic electric dipole moment ( edm ) in the @xmath8hg @xcite and @xmath9xe @xcite nuclei . as we know from past experience with @xmath10-odd forces",
    ", see the review article @xcite , there are powerful many - body mechanisms in heavy atoms and nuclei which allow one to expect a significant amplification of effects generated on the level of elementary interactions .",
    "there are also suggestions for using possible molecular and solid state enhancement mechanisms @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of atomic edm proceed through the _ nuclear schiff moment _ @xmath11 since the nuclear edm is shielded by atomic electrons @xcite .",
    "the schiff moment produces the @xmath12-odd electrostatic potential that , in turn , induces the atomic edm .",
    "the expectation value of the vector operator @xmath13 in a stationary nuclear state characterized by certain quantum numbers of angular momentum , @xmath14 , is possible only for @xmath15 owing to the requirements of rotational invariance .",
    "since all even - even nuclei have zero ground state spin , we need to consider an odd-@xmath16 nucleus .",
    "furthermore , the non - zero expectation value of a polar vector @xmath11 requires parity non - conservation in a nucleus ; in addition , being proportional to the @xmath2-odd pseudoscalar @xmath17 , this expectation value reveals the violation of @xmath2-invariance .",
    "a reliable evaluation of the nuclear schiff moment should include the estimates of renormalization effects due to  normal \" strong interactions inside the nucleus .",
    "the core polarization by the odd nucleon is important , especially in the case of the odd neutron , as @xmath8hg and @xmath9xe .",

    "the schiff moment in the body - fixed frame is enhanced being in fact proportional to the collective octupole moment .",

    "@xcite . the uncertainties related to the specific assumptions on @xmath12-odd forces and different approximations for nuclear structure are on the order of a factor 2 for the resulting schiff moment .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that _ soft octupole vibrations _ observed in some regions of the nuclear chart more frequently than static octupole deformation may produce a similar enhancement of the schiff moment .",
    "this would make heavy atoms containing nuclei with large collective schiff moments attractive for future experiments in search for @xmath12-violation ; experiments of this type are currently under progress or in preparation in several laboratories .",
    "recently we performed @xcite the estimate of the schiff moment generated in nuclei with the quadrupole deformation and soft octupole mode and showed that the result is nearly the same as in the case of the static octupole deformation .",
    "a related idea is explored in the present paper .",

    "these bands are connected via low - energy electric dipole transitions .",
    "this situation seems _ a - priori _ to be favorable for the enhancement of @xmath0-odd effects .",
    "below we examine the question whether the enhancement indeed exists in some spherical nuclei which have both collective quadrupole and octupole modes .",
    "the main weak interaction mixing can be expected to occur between the levels of the same spin and opposite parity that carry a significant admixture of the ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) states with the odd nucleon in the same single - particle orbit . in the odd - neutron nuclei the schiff moment is originated by the proton contribution to the collective phonon .",
    "a number of such nuclei have an appropriate opposite parity level with the same angular momentum close to the ground state .",
    "the mixing between the states of above mentioned nature can imitate the evolution of the spherical nucleus to the deformed pear - shaped state . in analogy with refs .",
    "@xcite , this might lead to enhancement of schiff moments .",
    "we will show that the effect does exist but , in the framework of the standard quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) , it is essentially compensated by the strong spreading of the single - particle strength that significantly reduces the weight of the desired configuration in the odd - nucleus ground state .",
    "we concentrate here only on physics connected to the soft vibrational modes . at the next stage",
    "the task of theory should be to go beyond the rpa and to combine all effects generated by @xmath22-violating interactions , including the influence of the core polarization and weak interaction admixtures to the phonon structure which are not discussed on the present work .",
    "such effects should be included for the quantitative answer ; however they are not expected to lead to a qualitative enhancement .",

    "for example , in a simple approximate model , where the strong nuclear potential is proportional to nuclear density and the spin - orbit interaction is neglected , the matrix element @xmath31 contains the single - particle momentum operator .",
    "this matrix element is proportional to @xmath32 , so that the small energy denominator cancels out . as mentioned above , the _ collective _ schiff moments in nuclei with static octupole deformation may be by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude stronger than single - particle moments in spherical nuclei .",
