    "interplay between noise and non - linearity of dynamical systems @xcite is known to arrive at crucial changing in behavior of systems displaying noise - induced @xcite and recurrence @xcite phase transitions , stochastic resonance @xcite , noise induced pattern formation @xcite , and noise induced transport @xcite .",
    "the constructive role of noise on dynamical systems includes hopping between multiple stable attractors @xcite , stabilization of the lorenz attractor near the threshold of its formation @xcite and stabilization of resonance related to the limit cycle near the hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "such type behavior is inherent in systems which involve discrete entities ( for instance , in ecological systems individuals form population stochastically in accordance with random births and deaths ) .",
    "examples of substantial alteration of finite systems under effect of intrinsic noises gives epidemics @xcite@xcite , predator - prey population dynamics @xcite , opinion dynamics @xcite , biochemical clocks @xcite , genetic networks @xcite , cyclic trapping reactions @xcite , etc . within the phase - plane language",
    ", phase transitions pointed out present the simplest case , where a fixed point appears only .",
    "we are interested in studying more complicated situation , when the system under consideration may display oscillatory behavior related to the limit cycle appearing as result of the hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "it has long been conjectured @xcite that in some situations the influence of noise would be sufficient to produce cyclic behavior @xcite .",
    "recent consideration @xcite allows the relation between the stochastic oscillations in the fixed point phase and the oscillations in the limit cycle phase to be elucidated . in the last case , making use of co - moving frame allows fluctuations transverse and longitudinal with respect to the limit cycle to be effectively decoupled .",
    "it appears while the latter fluctuations are of a diffusive nature , the former ones follow a stochastic path . to formulate related model we consider the system with a finite number of constituents related to components of the state vector @xcite @xmath0 characteristically , a deterministic component @xmath1 is proportional to total system size @xmath2 , whereas a random one @xmath3 is the same to its square root",
    "in the limit of infinite particle numbers @xmath4 , such systems are faithfully described by deterministic equations to find time dependence @xmath5 , which addresses the behavior of the system on a mean - field level . on the other hand ,",
    "a systematic study of corrections due to finite system size can capture the behavior of fluctuations @xmath6 about the mean - field solution .",
    "these fluctuations are governed with the langevin equations , however , in difference of approach @xcite , we consider multiplicative noises instead of additive ones , on the one hand , and nonlinear forces instead of linear ones , on the other .",
    "within such framework , the aim of the present paper is to extend analytical descriptions @xcite of finite - size stochastic effects to systems where noises play a crucial role with respect to periodic limit cycle solution creation or its supression .",
    "we will show that character of the system behavior is determined with relation between scales of temporal variation of principle variables and their coupling .",
    "the paper is organized along the following lines . in section [ sec.2 ] , we obtain conditions of the limit cycle creation making use the pair of stochastic equations with nonlinear forces and multiplicative noises . sections [ sec.3 ] , [ sec.4 ] are devoted to consideration of these conditions on the basis of stochastic lorenz system with different regimes of principle variables slaving . according to section [ sec.3 ] the limit cycle",
    "is created only in the case if the most fast variation displays a principle variable , which is coupled nonlinearly with two degrees of freedom or more .",
    "opposite case is studied in section [ sec.4 ] to show that the limit cycle disappears in non equilibrium steady state .",
    "section [ sec.5 ] concludes our consideration .",
    "according to the theorem of central manifold @xcite , to achieve a closed description of a limit cycle it is enough to use only two variables @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "in such a case , stochastic evolution of the system under investigation is defined by the langevin equations @xcite @xmath9 with forces @xmath10 and noise amplitudes @xmath11 , being functions of stochastic variables @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and white noise @xmath12 determined as usually : @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "our principle assumptions are as follows : ( i ) white noise @xmath12 is equal for both degrees of freedom @xmath7 ; ( ii ) microscopic transfer rates are non correlated for different variables @xmath7 .",
    "then , the probability distribution function @xmath15 is determined by the fokker - planck equation @xmath16 where sum over repeated greek indexes @xmath8 is meant and components of the probability current take the form @xmath17 with the generalized forces @xmath18 being determined with choice of the calculus parameter @xmath19 $ ] . within the steady state ,",
    "the components of the probability current take constant values @xmath20 and the system behaviour is defined by the following equations : @xmath21    multiplying the first of these equations by factor @xmath22 and the second one by @xmath23 and then subtracting results , we arrive at the explicit form of the probability distribution function as follows : @xmath24.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this function diverges at condition @xmath25 that physically means appearance of a domain of forbidden values of stochastic variables @xmath7 , which is bonded with a closed line of the limit cycle .",
    "characteristically , such a line appears if the denominator @xmath26 of fraction ( [ 7 ] ) includes even powers of both variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth to note the analytical expression ( [ 7 ] ) of the probability distribution function becomes possible due to the special form of the probability current ( [ 4 ] ) , where effective diffusion coefficient takes the multiplicative form @xmath29 . in general case , this coefficient is known @xcite to be defined with the expression @xmath30 where kernel @xmath31 determines transfer rate between microscopic states @xmath32 and @xmath33 , whereas factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 are specific noise amplitudes of values @xmath7 related to these states .",
