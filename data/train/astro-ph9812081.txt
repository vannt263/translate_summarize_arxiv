    "recent observations with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope have highlighted the presence of a number of submillimetre - luminous galaxies ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; holland et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al .  1998a ; hughes et al .  1998 ; eales et al .  1998 ) .",
    "to date about forty sources have been found .",
    "these measurements confirm earlier suggestions ( blain & longair 1993 ; eales & edmunds 1996 , 1997 ) that submillimetre - wave observations will provide an important probe of cosmology .",
    "the optical counterparts of these scuba sources are faint , most with @xmath4 ( smail et al .",
    "they are presumably not low - redshift sources : the best studied is smmj02399@xmath50136 ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) , a dust - enshrouded agn at @xmath6 , perhaps similar to iras f10214 + 4724 ( rowan - robinson et al .  1991",
    "; lacy et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the recent detection of molecular gas in smmj02399@xmath50136 ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 ) also suggests that these galaxies are similar .    what is the nature of these scuba - selected sources ?",
    "in particular are they similar to the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) observed locally ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ) ?",
    "they have the same submillimetre - wave flux densities as would have local ulirgs seen at high redshift ( barger et al .",
    "they also have similar optical colours ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ) to two of the three local ulirgs studied at ultraviolet wavelengths by trentham , kormendy & sanders ( 1998 ) , were those galaxies to be seen at high redshift .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then we might hope to be able to use the wealth of observational information available for local ulirgs to help to understand the properties of the scuba sources and their relevance to cosmology .",
    "whether the scuba sources are dust - enshrouded agns , like markarian 231 , or dust - enshrouded starbursts , like arp 220 , is an important question .",
    "this is difficult to determine for even local ulirgs , because there are up to several hundred magnitudes of extinction along our lines of sight to the galaxy cores at optical wavelengths . for local ulirgs ,",
    "simple conclusions can be drawn based on the general form of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( e.g.  sanders et al .",
    "1988a ) ; however , this information is not available for the scuba sources .",
    "recently , new more detailed methods based on mid - infrared spectroscopic diagnostics ( lutz et al .",
    "1996 , genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) have been used to resolve this question for the most local ulirgs .",
    "we construct redshift - dependent luminosity functions that are consistent with all the counts and backgrounds from a number of recent surveys at far - infrared and millimetre / submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "we use non - evolving gaussian luminosity functions over specified redshift ranges .",
    "these are the simplest luminosity functions that we could adopt , without the results being dependent on the properties of low - luminosity galaxies that are not probed by the scuba observations .",
    "contributions from these low - luminosity galaxies are important when computing backgrounds , although they contribute insignificantly to the counts .",
    "the parameterization used to compare models with observations reflects this fact . imposing all the constraints",
    "simultaneously does limit the possible form of the luminosity function and we identify three plausible models .",
    "given the redshift - dependent luminosity functions of these models , we investigate the properties to the individual sources using observations of their local ultraluminous counterparts , and derive the cosmological implications of the scuba galaxies under both the starburst and agn interpretation .",
    "we first investigate the possibility that the scuba sources are high - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "the starburst models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) are used to convert far - infrared luminosities to star - formation rates ; a transformation that is uncertain by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we then place the scuba galaxies on the madau plot , which relates the cosmic star formation rate to the cosmic epoch ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ; madau , della valle & panagia 1998 ) , and predict the total density of local stars produced in such objects .",
    "most of the star formation in the scuba sources is observed through huge amounts of internal extinction , and so will not be included in global star - formation rates that are computed using the optically selected samples that are normally used to construct the madau plot .",
    "indeed hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that deriving a star - formation rate from a rest - frame ultraviolet flux results in a value that is more than an order of magnitude too low .",
    "the scuba sources are thus not accounted for in the existing samples that are used to construct the madau plot .",
    "we then investigate the possibility that the scuba sources are high - redshift dust - enshrouded agn , as discussed by haehnelt , natarajan & rees ( 1998 ) and almaini , lawrence & boyle ( 1999 ) .",
    "the three distant submillimetre - luminous galaxies that have been studied in detail  apm08279 + 5255 ( irwin et al .",
    "1998 ; lewis et al . 1998 ; downes et al .",
    "submitted ) , smmj02399@xmath50136 and iras f10214 + 4724  all contain powerful agn .",
    "if all the sources derive their bolometric luminosity from agn that heat their dust shrouds radiatively by accretion onto a massive black hole , then we can use our redshift - dependent luminosity functions to compute the comoving integrated mass density of these black holes .",
    "we find plausible ( although not unique ) scenarios that are consistent with all the observations and present their cosmological implications . finally , we highlight future work which may help to distinguish between the various scenarios . throughout this paper",
    "we assume an einstein  de sitter world model with @xmath7kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 .",
    "there have been many recent measurements of the far - infrared and submillimetre source counts and backgrounds at a number of wavelengths : see table 1 .",
    "this has been a recent field of substantial activity because of new instrumentation , both scuba and _",
    "iso_. if we assume that the sed at far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths is known for all the sources , we can then use all these measurements in conjunction to constrain the bivariate far - infrared luminosity  redshift function of these sources .",
    "0.75 mm @xmath9    we assume that the galaxies have the thermal seds of warm dust that is heated by an enshrouded starburst or agn , and adopt a simple analytic form for the luminosity function between a minimum and maximum redshift .",
    "all the observational constraints on the model are imposed through integral functions , and so do not require unique solutions .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to see which general classes of luminosity  redshift distributions are ruled out and why .    to ensure consistent definitions",
    "are used when matching models to observations , first we present all the details of our computations .",
    "much of this will be familiar to many readers , but different authors define parameters in slightly different ways .",
    "secondly , we point out some generic features of the comparison between our models and observations , in particular the results of requiring the models to be consistent with source counts at one wavelength and with the infrared background at another simultaneously . finally , we isolate some plausible luminosity functions that are consistent with all the observations for further investigation .",
    "we define a bivariate 60-@xmath0 m luminosity - redshift function @xmath10 , with units mpc@xmath11@xmath12 , such that @xmath13 is the total number density of galaxies with 60-@xmath0 m luminosity between @xmath14 and @xmath15 with redshifts between @xmath16 and @xmath17",

    "source counts constrain the integral of @xmath38 over redshift and luminosity above some redshift - dependent limit .",
    "however , measurements of the background light constrain the integral of the product of luminosity @xmath39 and @xmath38 over redshift and all luminosities . for a saunders luminosity function with pure density evolution ,",
    "we compare in fig.1 the ratio of the predicted 850-@xmath0 m source count and 240-@xmath0 m background as compared with the observed values listed in table1 as a function of the characteristic luminosity @xmath40 .",
    "the minimum is produced by the different constraints on the integral of @xmath38 imposed by the source counts and the background measurement .",
    "very low luminosity galaxies make a negligible contribution to the source counts , but a substantial one to the infrared background if @xmath41 is low in the saunders function .",
    "hence , a low normalization is required to explain the background data , but a high one is required to explain the source count data , and so the ratio plotted in fig.1 is very high at low @xmath41 .",
    "increasing @xmath41 increases the fraction of high - luminosity galaxies , and so lowers the ratio of the normalizations required in the figure . at very high @xmath41 ,",
    "the source counts are produced by a very small number of extremely luminous sources , which cause the background to be extremely high based on their luminosities alone .",
    "hence , the ratio of the normalization begins to increase again , producing the minimum in fig.1 .",
    "if the flux threshold ( lower limit ) in the luminosity integral in equation ( 5 ) is reduced , then the turn - up of the ratio at high luminosities is less marked , and disappears as the lower limit tends to zero .",
    "it is intriguing that this minimum in the ratio occurs at a very high characteristic luminosity @xmath42l@xmath43 .",
    "locally @xmath44l@xmath43 , and so if the luminosity function of the scuba sources has a saunders form , huge amounts of luminosity evolution are required to match the data .",

    "hence , lower normalizations are required in fig.1 in order to explain the data for 40-k sources as compared with 70-k sources .",
    "the 40-k curve is consistent with a ratio of one over a range of luminosities , suggesting that if a saunders luminosity function describes the scuba sources , then they must have temperatures of about 40k .",
    "this was another conclusion of blain et al .",
    "( 1999a ) : see their figure 4  in their favoured scenarios most of the scuba sources are at @xmath45 and have luminosities @xmath46 and dust temperatures @xmath47k .    finally , note that the results in fig.1 are only weakly dependent on the form of density evolution parameterized by @xmath48 .",
    "we now compute the normalizations @xmath22 required to fit the 850-@xmath0 m source count data for a number of gaussian luminosity functions ( equation 1 ) with no density or luminosity evolution .",
    "@xmath22 is constant between redshifts @xmath49 and @xmath50 and is zero elsewhere .",
    "this is the simplest possible form of the luminosity function ; at present the observations do not justify a more rigorous treatment .",
    "this parametrization is motivated in part by the fact that the local 60-@xmath0 m luminosity function ( saunders et al .",
    "1990 ) is approximately gaussian at the bright end .",
    "the local elliptical galaxy luminosity function ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 , ferguson & sandage 1991 ) is also gaussian , which is relevant if the scuba sources evolve into elliptical galaxies : see section 3",
    ". one important feature of the gaussian function is that it is only valid for high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "large numbers of galaxies with low far - infrared luminosities will also exist between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "although these will not contribute to the source counts , they may contribute significantly to the infrared backgrounds if they are very numerous .",
    "hence , when we match our luminosity functions to counts ( equation 5 ) , we require the model prediction to equal the observed values , but when we match our luminosity functions to background fluxes ( equation 3 ) , we require the model prediction to be less than or equal to the observed values .",
    "our approach is fundamentally different from that of blain et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "we are not evolving the local 60-@xmath0 m luminosity function to high redshift . indeed , in section 3 , we argue that the systems which have the highest far - infrared luminosities for redshifts @xmath51 probably evolve into elliptical galaxies , which are not the most luminous systems at far - infrared wavelengths in the local universe .    in figs2 to 7 we present the required normalization constants for a gaussian luminosity function to fit the 850-@xmath0 m data of smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for various values of @xmath24 and @xmath52 given a constant dust temperature @xmath53 .",
    "the uncertainties are large ( see table1 ) , and so the range of acceptable normalizations is large , with a peak - to - peak spread of about a factor of 4 . given these large uncertainties , all the 850-@xmath0 m counts by different authors listed in table 1 are fully consistent .",
    "some general features of figs2 to 7 are worth highlighting :    1 .",
    "@xmath54 ( a @xmath55-function ) never appears to fit the data well ; 2 .",
    "lower normalizations are required for higher characteristic luminosities ; 3 .",
    "the absolute values of the normalizations depend primarily on where the dust spectrum peak is shifted in wavelength space .",
    "it is shifted closer to 850@xmath0 m for a source at higher redshift at either 40 or 70k , and so a lower normalization is required at higher @xmath16 ; 4 .",
    "lower temperatures require lower normalizations for a given 60-@xmath0 m luminosity , since 850@xmath0 m is closer to the blackbody peak .      having isolated various models that are consistent with the 850-@xmath0 m counts , we now consider the constraints from measurements at other wavelengths .",
    "we select a number of models with various values of @xmath24 , @xmath52 , @xmath22 , and @xmath53 , each represented by a point on the curves in figs2 to 7 , and thus consistent with the 850-@xmath0 m count . for each model , we consider three separate scenarios : scenario `` 0 '' , in which the 850-@xmath0 m source counts are the mean smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) values ; scenario `` + '' , in which they are 1@xmath24 larger ; and scenario `` @xmath5 '' , in which they are 1@xmath24 smaller .",
    "the counts in the `` @xmath5 '' scenario are very close to the lowest published counts ( barger et al .",
    "1998a ) . in all ,",
    "a total of 45 models , each of which generates three scenarios , are considered .    in table 2",
    ", we show how well the models defined by these parameters account for the measurements at other wavelengths .",
    "the numbers in that table represent the model prediction relative to the observed counts or background fluxes listed in table 1 , assuming scenario `` 0 '' .",
    "the fractional uncertainties in the numbers in table 2 are given in table 3 .",
    "other measurements exist in the literature that we do not use while making this comparison .",
    "for example , measurements of 15-@xmath0 m source counts with _ iso _ have recently been made ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 , aussel et al .",
    "however , these measurements probe far down the wien tail of the dust spectrum , and are of very limited use in constraining the high - redshift luminosity function .",
    "furthermore we would need to account for contamination in the 15-@xmath0 m samples by nearby ( unobscured ) galaxies and agn .",
    "similarly the iras 60-@xmath0 m source counts ( saunders et al .",
    "1990 ) are dominated by nearby ( @xmath56 ) sources .",
    "measurements at 1.25 mm offer a promising probe in the future , but to date measurements have only been made for iras - selected galaxies ( franceschini , andreani & danese 1998 ) .",
    "unbiased samples are not yet available at this wavelength .",
    "some of the more notable general trends shown in table 2 are :    1 .",
    "models in which the sources are at higher redshift tend to produce higher source counts or backgrounds at longer wavelengths , because the peak of the dust spectrum is shifted to longer wavelengths ; 2 .",
    "models in which the sources are at higher redshift tend to produce higher backgrounds for a given source count _ at the same wavelength_. the counts probe only part of the total range of galaxy luminosities , and there are a larger number of low - luminosity sources that contribute to the backgrounds but not to the counts ; 3 .   on decreasing the temperature from 70 to 40k , the predicted 2.8-mm counts increase , but the predicted 175-@xmath0 m counts and 140- and 240-@xmath0 m backgrounds decrease",
    ", because the peak in the dust emission spectrum shifts to longer wavelengths ; 4 .",
    "changing the temperature has a substantial effect on the relative value of the source counts and backgrounds at the same wavelength .",
    "decreasing the temperature has a greater relative effect on the counts , because the lower limit in the integral in equation 5 is decreased : see fig.8 .",
    "seven of the models that we investigate are consistent with all the observations : see the last column of table 2 for details .",
    "these all have a high characteristic luminosity greater than @xmath57 . using a different parametrization , blain et al .",
    "( 1999a ) also found that most of the scuba sources are distant galaxies with similarly high luminosities .",

    "models in which the galaxies are nearby , that is where @xmath59 , tend to have similar problems .",
    "conversely , models with very low temperatures @xmath60 k would overproduce the 2.8-mm counts , but such low - temperature sources are ruled out by the consistency arguments of blain et al .",

    "we can then put the scuba sources on the the madau plot : see figs9 , 10 and 11 .",
    "the other points on the madau plot all come from optically - selected samples .",
    "as there is no luminosity evolution in the models between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the comoving star - formation rate is constant between these redshifts , and so the lines on the madau plot are horizontal .",

    "this is because more stars need to be formed to produce a given bolometric luminosity we observe more than 10@xmath75 years after the starburst .",
    "it is interesting to note that the imf proposed by zepf & silk ( 1996 ) for elliptical galaxies , if valid for the scuba sources , results in them being at the extreme low end of our proposed range .",
    "this is because these models underproduce low - mass stars , and so result in a low star - formation rate for a given amount of bolometric luminosity : the low - mass stars , when young , do not contribute significantly to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the implication here is that if scuba sources evolve into elliptical galaxies , then they do not contribute significantly to the star - formation rate of the universe at any redshift given our models of the luminosity function .",

    "therefore , scuba sources can not be identified as submillimetre - luminous galaxies based on broadband optical colours alone .",
    "the star - formation rates given in table 5 are far higher than the rates in normal galaxies .",

    "effect ( iia ) is not a major source of discrepancy between our results and those of blain et al .",
    "( 1999a )  in both cases , most of the star formation occurs in very luminous sources with @xmath83l@xmath2 .",
    "effect ( iib ) is a much more substantial source of discrepancy .",
    "blain et al .",
    "( 1999a ) assume a redshift - dependent saunders luminosity function at high redshift which is related to the local 60-@xmath0 m luminosity function by simple luminosity evolution .",

    "our objects , when evolved to , @xmath84 are early - type stellar populations , quite unrelated to the objects which dominate the local 60-@xmath0 m luminosity function .",
    "we consequently derive a far lower normalization to our luminosity functions than do blain et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "the present observations do not permit us to distinguish between these models , but this should be a straightforward exercise when a significantly complete redshift distribution for the scuba sources is known .",
    "in addition , eales et al .",

    "this number is much closer to the numbers presented in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption that the scuba sources contribute the same fraction of the submillimeter background at all wavelengths , on which the eales et al .",

    "furthermore , it is unclear how we should relate star - formation rates derived from optical or ultraviolet luminosities of normal field galaxies to star - formation rates derived from submillimetre fluxes of the scuba sources .",
    "-2 mm    -5 mm    -2 mm    -5 mm    -2 mm    -5 mm      we have hinted that the scuba sources could evolve into elliptical galaxies .",
    "local ulirgs have gas densities that are similar to the core stellar densities in elliptical galaxies ( kormendy & sanders 1992 , doyon et al .",
    "if the scuba sources have similar morphologies to local ulirgs , we might then expect them to evolve into elliptical galaxies .    in table 7",
    "we present the density parameter in stars produced by the scuba sources , in our luminosity - function and star - formation models . for most models , particularly those with imfs appropriate to elliptical galaxies ( models ix and x ) ,",

    "these numbers are sufficiently low that a scenario in which all the scuba sources evolve into elliptical galaxies is consistent with galaxy formation models that predict low - redshift elliptical formation ( kauffmann 1996 ; kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "they are also low enough to be consistent with the observed paucity of red galaxies in the hubble deep field and the consequent interpretation that less than 30per cent of field ellipticals formed at high redshift ( zepf 1997 ; barger et al .",
    ".    various lines of argument suggest that the elliptical galaxies in clusters are very old .",
    "not only did the stars form a long time ago ( ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; stanford et al .  1998",
    "; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) , but it appears that in the richest clusters the most luminous elliptical galaxies themselves were assembled by @xmath87 ( trentham & mobasher 1998 ) .",
    "it is further possible that most 3c radio galaxies are cluster ellipticals in the process of formation ( best , longair & rottgering 1998 ) .",
    "this leads to a natural question : are the scuba galaxies forming cluster ellipticals ?",
    "low - redshift cluster ellipticals are highly clustered , with a bias of about 4 , and an even greater bias at high redshifts ( fry 1996 ; mo & white 1996 ) . in comparison , the reasonably uniform detection rate of scuba galaxies in the fields studied by smail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggests that this is unlikely .",
    "these fields contained low - redshift clusters ( which magnify the background scuba sources through gravitational lensing ) , but these low - redshift clusters are unrelated to the hypothesized ellipticals in formation that we are discussing here .",
    "instead , we propose that the scuba sources are a forming trace population of field ellipticals .",
    "this is consistent with the constraints outlined in the previous paragraph .",
    "this is not to say that if we happened to point scuba at a cluster in formation we would not detect a large number of galaxies .",
    "@xmath88    @xmath89    @xmath90    it has been recently recognized that lyman - break galaxies are highly clustered at high redshift ( pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) , and so it is worth investigating a possible link between these objects and the scuba sources .",
    "looking at the spectra of the two kinds of galaxies , we see that that lyman - break galaxies and the scuba sources are very likely two completely separate populations of objects ( for example compare the 0.5 @xmath0 m spectrum of the lyman - break galaxy 1512-cb58 at @xmath91 taken by pettini et al .",
    "1998 using lris on keck ii with the 0.5 @xmath0 m spectrum of the scuba source smmj02399@xmath50136 at @xmath6 taken by ivison et al .",
    "1998 using the mos spectrograph on the cfht ) .",
    "however , while this observation is interesting , it does not rule out a hypothetical link since it is possible that one type of galaxy evolves into the other on short timescales .",
    "measuring correlation functions would be the best way of testing such a hypothetical link .",
    "unfortunately , the forty or so scuba sources found so far do not have redshift measurements , so such an analysis is not possible at present .",
    "such a calculation will , however , be possible once a large sample of scuba sources with measured redshifts is available .",
    "if the elliptical galaxies that went through a submillimetre - luminous phase represent a sub - population , then their star - formation history must be similar to that of the rest of the remaining field elliptical population .",
    "otherwise a huge scatter in the stellar mass - to - light versus light correlation ( oegerle & hoessel 1991 ) would be produced .",
    "a few ellipticals ( e.g. stockton et al .  1995 , dunlop et al .  1996 ) must have formed at high redshift and do not lie in very rich x - ray clusters .",
    "it is not obvious that these galaxies will evolve into cluster ellipticals .",
    "the existence of such objects lends additional support to a scenario in which the scuba sources evolve into a trace sub - population of field elliptical galaxies .",
    "furthermore , many high - redshift quasars are surrounded by heavily enriched gas , and so there must have been considerable star formation in their host galaxies at high redshift ( matteucci & padovani 1993 ) .      in table 8 , we present the total amount of metals produced by the scuba sources for our models .",
    "the average metallicity of the universe at @xmath84 is poorly known , but is probably about half solar ",
    "see for example section 5 of fukugita et al .",
    "( 1998 )  if the solar metallicity is 0.0189 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and is much larger than the values listed in table 8 .",
    "hence , it appears that a sufficiently small fraction of cosmic star - formation activity occurs in the scuba sources that they still may be a sub - population of elliptical galaxies undergoing a monolithic collapse at high redshift , without significantly overproducing the metal mass density of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "if _ all _ elliptical galaxies formed via monolithic collapse at high redshift , then this would result in a metal mass density of the universe that is higher than that observed  the `` cluster - field analogy '' of madau 1997 : see also mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) and renzini ( 1997 ) .    for comparison ,",
    "if the enrichment of the ly@xmath20 forest is regarded as a signature of cosmic enrichment , then the metallicity of the intergalactic medium at @xmath92 is about 10@xmath93 to 10@xmath27 solar ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; songalia & cowie 1996 ; songaila 1997 ; cowie & songaila 1998 ) , and may be higher at lower redshift .",
    "this value is close to the metallicities in table 8 . but this similarity is perhaps not too meaningful because one would expect that most of the metals produced in the scuba galaxies would remain bound within the galaxies .",
    "this is because ellipticals have deep gravitational potential wells and thus low ejection efficiencies ( nath & chiba 1995 ) ; based on their gas consumption alone , the scuba sources must have masses in excess of 10@xmath94m@xmath2 .",
    "hence , only a small fraction of the metals should leak out into the intergalactic medium , and so the values listed in table 8 are best interpreted as upper limits when comparing with the intergalactic medium metallicity , if the scuba sources are all at redshifts greater than three .",
    "we also note that most low - redshift elliptical galaxies have metal - poor interstellar media : this is not what we would expect if the metals produced in the early history of these galaxies remained bound to the galaxy , as we argue above .",
    "one possible explanation of this apparent discrepancy is that the elliptical galaxies accumulate substantial x - ray halos ( e.g.  forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) , which then strip the metals out of the centres of galaxies .",
    "another possible explanation is that the scuba sources evolve into the few local ellipticals that _ do _ have metal - rich interstellar media , for example centaurus a.      an alternative interpretation is that the scuba sources derive their bolometric luminosities from dust - enshrouded agn and not from star formation at all .",
    "a number of lines of argument suggest that this may well be a plausible scenario .",
    "first , the one scuba - selected source that has been studied in detail ( smmj02399@xmath50136 ; ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) contains a powerful dust - enshrouded agn .",
    "note however that it is still possible for most of its bolometric luminosity to be produced in a starburst .",
    "the hyperluminous gravitationally lensed galaxy iras f10214 + 4724 at @xmath95 ( rowan - robinson et al .  1991 ; lacy et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) also contains a dust - enshrouded agn .",
    "the other two known ultraluminous high - redshift dusty galaxies h1413 + 117 ( barvainis et al .",
    "1995 ) and apm08279 + 5255 ( irwin et al .  1998 ; lewis et al .",
    "1998 ) also contain powerful agn .",
    "if these objects are at all typical of high - redshift submillimetre - luminous sources , then it may well be plausible that a signficant fraction of their bolometric luminosities are powered by agn as opposed to starbursts .",
    "a second line of argument is based on the observation that in local universe , massive dark objects ( mdos )  probably supermassive black holes  are inferred to reside in the centers of most nearby galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1997 ) , based on gas- and stellar - dynamical measurements ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "these mdos are plausibly dead quasar engines that have run out of fuel .",
    "magorrian et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that the mass of the inferred mdo is well correlated with the luminosity of the spheroid stellar population in the host galaxy .",
    "the total mass density in mdos in the local universe is about 1.7 @xmath78 10@xmath96m@xmath2mpc@xmath11 ( haehnelt et al .",
    "1998 ) , about an order of magnitude greater than the inferred mass density of black holes that is required to explain the blue light of quasars ( phinney 1998 , haehnelt et al.1998 ) , unless the accretion efficiency in quasars is much less than 1per cent .",
    "one interesting idea suggested by haehnelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is that most accretion onto supermassive black holes in the centres of galaxies is obscured by dust .",
    "if this is the case , then the presence of a population of dust - obscured agn can explain the above discrepancy .",
    "the scuba sources would be natural candidates for this population .",
    "we use our luminosity functions to calculate the comoving mass density of mdos , @xmath97 required to generate the observed bolometric luminosity of the scuba sources , assuming accretion at some efficiency @xmath98  this is the accretion luminosity divided by the eddington luminosity : @xmath99 @xmath100 , 1.6 and 1.8 in models b , f and g respectively .",
    "these numbers are all below the local mass density of mdos .",
    "therefore it is plausible that all the scuba sources are agn , but they may only help to explain the discrepancy between the local density of mdos and the inferred density of black holes required to explain the blue light of quasars if their accretion luminosity is significantly lower than 1per cent of the eddington value .",
    "recent work by almaini , lawrence & boyle ( submitted ) , based on the x - ray luminosity function and background confirms that a large fraction of the scuba sources could be dust - enshrouded agn .",
    "a third , but weaker , line of reasoning is based on the analogy with the ultraluminous @xmath101 cd galaxy irasp09104@xmath54109 ( kleinmann et al .",
    "1988 ) , which with a bolometric luminosity of about @xmath102l@xmath2 is by far the most luminous object detected at mid - infrared wavelengths at @xmath103 .",
    "it is at the centre of a very substantial cooling flow ( fabian & crawford 1995 ) .",
    "two of the cd galaxies in the lensing clusters studied by smail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were detected at 850@xmath0 m ( edge et al .",
    "submitted ) , although they are not included in the counts presented by smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 1999 ) . if the physical processes that make irasp09104@xmath54109 into a hyperluminous galaxy are related to its being in the center of a cluster , then we might expect the same processes in the cds detected by scuba .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of iras p09104@xmath54109 appears to come from a powerful dust - enshrouded agn ( kleinmann et al .",
    "1988 ) , and an analogous mechanism could plausibly be powering the high - redshift scuba sources .",
    "the main limitations of the present work are that :    1 .   we can not determine whether the scuba sources are star - forming galaxies or agn .",
    "clearly the implications for cosmology would be very different for these two scenarios ; 2 .",
    "we can not determine uniquely the redshift - dependent luminosity function of the scuba sources , either to tell which of models b , f and g or a different kind of model ( blain et al .",
    "1999a ) are most correct ; 3 .   we can not determine the conversion factor to transform the far - infrared luminosity into a star - formation rate for the scuba sources to within one order of magnitude , even if all the far - infrared luminosity is assumed to be generated by star formation .",
    "given these limitations , we suggest the following future studies to address each of the problems listed above :    1 .   optical spectroscopic observations of scuba galaxies should be made to search for agn , for example to determine the line ratios of hydrogen recombination to forbidden lines ( sanders 1998b ; veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ; evans 1996 ) and carry out spectral polarimetry ( e.g.  hines & wills 1993 , januzzi et al .",
    "note , however , that these measurements are extremely difficult to carry out for very distant galaxies , and can not be used to determine unambiguously whether most of the bolometric luminosity comes from a starburst or an agn , because of the huge amount of internal extinction towards the galaxy centres at optical wavelengths .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the ratio of high- to low - excitation mid - infrared emission lines in combination with the strength of a 7.7-@xmath0 m pah feature to search for agn in local ulirgs , but it will be quite some time before such measurements become available for the distant scuba sources .",
    "crude interpretations can be made on the basis of source temperatures and seds ( sanders et al .",
    "1998a ) , for example compare the seds of arp 220 and mrk 231 .",
    "perhaps the best we can hope for in the near future is to match the sed of each scuba source to that of a plausible low - redshift counterpart , for which mid - infrared observations have been used to determine a power source , and assume the high - redshift source is powered in the same way ; 2 .",
    "an accurate determination of the redshift - dependent luminosity function will become available once redshifts for a significant number of scuba sources are obtained .",
    "in addition , further surveys with scuba and other millimetre / submillimetre - wave detectors ( glenn et al .  1998 ) should allow the luminosity function to be determined accurately ( blain 1998 ) .",
    "for many of our models ( table 8) , the total star - formation rate in high - redshift ulirgs is greater than at low redshifts ; a measurement of the redshift distribution would allow this statement to be quantified far more accurately .",
    "3 .   selecting star - formation parameters to use in the leitherer & heckman models is a difficult exercise .",
    "this is a particular problem for the distant scuba galaxies , for which only very limited information about their global properties is available .",
    "progress in this area would be possible if the low - redshift remnants of the scuba galaxies were identified , and their stellar populations studied in detail in order to investigate their imf .",
    "some clues are given in section 3.1 , but the conclusions there are far from rigorous at this stage .",
    "more generally , placing the scuba galaxies in the context of the galaxy - formation problem is clearly an important exercise .",
    "measurements of the redshift distribution will be an crucial part of this .",
    "for example , these measurements will let us see where the comoving bolometric luminosity density of the scuba sources peaks , relative to the peak in the comoving star - formation rate in other galaxies ( madau et al .",
    "1996 , madau et al .  1998 ,",
    "pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) and to the peak in the comoving agn luminosity density at ultraviolet ( boyle & terlevich 1998 ) or radio ( dunlop 1998 ) wavelengths .",
    "1 .   we identify various redshift - dependent luminosity functions that are consistent with the 850-@xmath0 m scuba source counts and observations at other far - infrared and submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "consistency can only be achieved if the 850-@xmath0 m scuba source counts are towards the lower end of the range suggested by smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in all of the consistent models ,",
    "the scuba sources have high bolometric luminosities in excess of @xmath104l@xmath2 .",
    "2 .   at present",
    "we can not identify whether the power sources in the scuba galaxies are predominantly starbursts or agn .",
    "3 .   if the scuba sources are dusty ultraluminous star - forming galaxies , then they need not dominate the star - formation rate of the universe at any redshift .",
    "in particular , if they evolve into elliptical galaxies , our models suggest that they only contribute a few percent of the local spheroidal stellar population .",
    "this result is consistent with a scenario in which most elliptical galaxies formed at low redshift , as is implied by the paucity of red galaxies in wide - field @xmath3-band surveys .",
    "the alternative scenario in which the scuba sources are powerful dust - enshrouded agn is also possible .",
    "if the agn are powered by accretion onto a black hole with a luminosity that is about one per cent of the eddington value , then they may help to explain away the discrepancy of a factor of ten between the observed mass density of supermassive black holes in the local universe and that required to produce the blue light of high - redshift quasars .",
    "tight constraints on the redshift - dependent luminosity function of submillimetre - luminous galaxies at high redshift will follow from spectroscopic measurements of a large sample of scuba sources ( barger et al . in preparation ) .",
    "obtaining accurate star - formation rates for the galaxies and identifying the nature of the power source will be more difficult . matching the seds of the scuba sources to those of local ulirgs , for which power sources have been determined using mid - infrared spectroscopy ,",

    "<S> a major recent development in extragalactic astronomy has been the discovery of a population of galaxies that are luminous at submillimetre wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of their spectral energy distributions suggest that these galaxies are the high - redshift analogues of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) observed locally . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the implications for the galaxy formation problem if this is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> we identify plausible ( but non - unique ) redshift - dependent galaxy luminosity functions that are consistent with both source counts at 2800 , 850 , 450 and 175@xmath0 m , and far - infrared background radiation intensities at 850 , 240 and 140@xmath0 m . in all our models , </S>",
    "<S> most of the submillimetre - luminous sources are distant galaxies with high bolometric luminosities @xmath1l@xmath2 . as for many local ulirgs , </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to determine whether these luminous galaxies are powered by starbursts , like the local galaxy arp 220 , or by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , like the local galaxy markarian 231 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate both possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> if the submillimetre - luminous galaxies are all starbursts , then we predict that the fraction of the cosmic star - formation rate in these objects is large , but does not necessarily dominate the star - formation rate of the universe  the madau plot  at any redshift . only a few per cent by mass of the present - epoch spheroidal stellar population would have been formed in such a population of star - forming galaxies , consistent with the constraints on the number of galaxies with old stellar populations in the field at low and intermediate redshifts derived from @xmath3-band surveys . </S>",
    "<S> if the submillimetre - luminous galaxies are all powered by agn , then the comoving density of supermassive black holes onto which material is accreting at high redshift probably equals no more than a few per cent of the local density of massive dark objects .    </S>",
