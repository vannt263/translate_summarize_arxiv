    "since the discovery of radiation induced magnetorersistance oscillations ( rimos ) and zero - resistance states ( zrs ) in ultra - high mobility two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems,@xcite tremendous experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite efforts have been devoted to study this exciting phenomenon and a general understanding of it has been reached . under the influence of a microwave radiation of frequency @xmath8 , the low - temperature magnetoresistance @xmath0 of a 2d electron gas ( eg ) , exhibits periodic oscillation as a function of the inverse magnetic field .",
    "the rimos feature the periodical appearance of peak - valley pairs around @xmath9 , i.e. a maximum at @xmath10 and a minimum at @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath15 are the node points of the oscillation . with increasing the radiation intensity the amplitudes of the peak - valley oscillations increase and the resistance @xmath0 around the minima of a few lowest-@xmath16 pairs can drop down towards negative direction but will stop when a vanishing resistance is reached , i.e. zrs .",
    "in addition to these basic features , secondary peak - valley pair structures were also observed experimentally@xcite and predicted theoretically@xcite around @xmath17 and 2/3 .",
    "they were referred to the effect of two- and three - photon processes and their minima were shown also to be able to develop into negative value when increasing the radiation further.@xcite recent measurement at 27ghz with intensified microwave intensity,@xcite confirmed these mutliphoton - related peak - valley pairs and the zrss developed from their minima .",
    "a careful theoretical analysis with enhanced radiation convincingly reproduced these structures and predicted more peak - valley pairs related to multiphoton processes.@xcite    despite intensive experimental and theoretical studies have been done in the case of monochromatic irradiation , further investigations beyond this configuration are highly desirable for a deeper understanding of this fascinating phenomenon .",
    "an easy way is to study the response of the 2d system to a bichromatic radiation , which apparently can not be reduced simply to the superposition of the system response to each monochromatic radiation .",
    "thus the presence of a second radiation of different frequency could provide additional insight into the problem of microwave - driven 2d electron system .",
    "theoretically , effect of a bichromatic irradiation on transport of a 2d electron gas was investigated within a model of a clean classical gas , in which kohn s theorem is violated entirely due to nonparabolicity without invoking landau quantization.@xcite some features that are specific to the bichromatic case , such as new domain of magnetic field within which the diagonal conductivity is negative , were revealed .",
    "experimentally , zudov _",
    "et al._@xcite recently measured the magnetoresistance of a high - mobility 2d electron system under the combined driving of two radiation fields of frequency @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and disclosed features of rimos which are quite different from those under monochromatic radiation of frequency @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "they detected a new resistance minimum under bichromatic microwave radiation , which seems to originate from a frequency mixing process , possibly a precursor of bichromatic zrs .    in this paper",
    "we report our studies on microwave photoresistance response of high - mobility two - dimensional electron systems under bichromatic irradiation , based on the balance - equation approach to magnetotransport for high - carrier - density systems , extended to the case of simultaneous driving of two radiation fields of different frequencies .",
    "the balance - equation approach , though semiclassical in nature , has been shown to capture the essence of this radiation - induced nonlinear magnetotransport quantitatively.@xcite under bichromatic irradiation of @xmath3 , we find that most of the characteristic peak - valley pairs in the curve of @xmath0 versus magnetic field in th case of monochromatic irradiation of either @xmath1 or @xmath2 disappear , except the one around @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath0 oscillations show up mainly as new peak - valley structures around other positions related to multiple photon processes of mixing frequencies @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc .",
    "the derivation of balance equations under bichromatic radiation follows that of monochromatic radiation.@xcite the nature of the balance - equation approach and its applicability to radiation - driven magnetotransport in high - mobilty 2d electron systems of high carrier density , was examined closely in ref .. we refer the readers to it for detail .    in the case of bichromatic radiation",
    "we consider that a dc or slowly time - varying electric field @xmath18 and two high frequency ( hf ) fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 are applied simultaneously in a quasi-2d system consisting of @xmath21 interacting electrons in a unit area of the @xmath22-@xmath23 plane , together with a magnetic field @xmath24 along the @xmath25 direction .",
    "the frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 are high enough and their difference is large enough that @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as @xmath26 ( for arbitrary integers @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , are all much larger than @xmath29 , where @xmath30 stands for the scale of the time variation of slowly varying field @xmath18 , or the time scale within which one carries out the transport measurement , whichever the shorter . the approach is based on the separation of the center - of - mass motion from the relative electron motion of the electrons and describes the transport state of a high - carrier - density many - electron system under radiation fields in terms of a rapidly time - varying electron drift velocity oscillating at both base radiation frequencies , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 @xmath33 together with another part @xmath34 for the slowly varying electron drift motion , as well as an electron temperature @xmath35 characterizing the electron heating.@xcite in the case of ultra - clean electron gas at low temperatures , the slowly time - varying quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfy the following force- and energy - balance equations:@xcite @xmath36 @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 determined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 determined by @xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the electron charge and effective mass , @xmath46 is the damping force of the moving center - of - mass , @xmath47 is the averaged rate of the electron energy absorption from the hf fields , and @xmath48 is the average rate of the electron energy dissipation to the lattice . in the above equations , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are bessel functions of order @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "here @xmath54 stands for the in - plane wavevector , @xmath55 is the effective impurity scattering potential , and @xmath56 is the imaginary part of the electron density correlation function of the quasi-2d system in the magnetic field . in eq.([eqw ] ) , @xmath57 represents the 3d wavevector @xmath58 plus the branch index @xmath59 , and the summation is for all possible 3d phonon modes of frequency @xmath60 having electron - phonon scattering matrix element @xmath61 . @xmath62 $ ] ( with @xmath63 ) is the imaginary part of the electron - phonon correlation function . the @xmath64 function of a 2d system in a magnetic field can be expressed in the landau representation:@xcite @xmath65\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\,\\hspace{2cm}\\times\\,\\,{\\rm im}g_n(\\varepsilon + \\omega){\\rm im}g_{n'}(\\varepsilon ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66^{-1}y^le^{-y}[l_n^l(y)]^2 $ ] with @xmath67 the associate laguerre polynomial , @xmath68 is the magnetic length , @xmath69 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function at electron temperature @xmath35 . the density of states of the @xmath70-th landau level is modeled with a gaussian form:@xcite @xmath71 , \\label{gauss}\\ ] ] having a half - width @xmath72 around the level center @xmath73 .",
    "here @xmath74 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath75 is the linear mobility at lattice temperature @xmath76 in the absence of the magnetic field , and @xmath77 is a semi - empirical parameter to take account of the difference of the transport scattering time @xmath78 determining the mobility @xmath75 , from the single particle lifetime @xmath79 related to landau level broadening .    for time - independent @xmath34 , we immediately deduce the transverse and longitudinal dc resistivities from eq.([eqv0 ] ) : @xmath80 @xmath81 the ( linear ) magnetoresistivity is its @xmath82 limit : @xmath83    we assume that the 2deg is contained in a thin sample suspended in vacuum at plane @xmath84 . when both electromagnetic waves illuminate upon the plane perpendicularly with the incident electric fields @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the hf electric fields in the 2deg , determined by the electrodynamic equations , are @xmath87 using this @xmath88 in eqs.([eqv1 ] ) and ( [ eqv2 ] ) , and @xmath89 in eqs.([eqv3 ] ) and ( [ eqv4 ] ) , the oscillating velocity @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( and thus the argument @xmath90 ) are explicitly expressed in terms of incident field @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the oscillating velocity @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( and thus the argument @xmath93 ) are explicitly expressed in terms of incident field @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , in the case of weak measuring current limit ( @xmath96 ) we need only to solve the energy balance equation @xmath97 to obtain the electron temperature @xmath35 under given incident radiation fields , before directly calculating the linear magnetoresistivity from eq.([rxx ] )",
    ".    within certain field range , the magnetoresistivity @xmath0 given by eq.([rxxg ] ) can be negative at small @xmath98 , but will change towards the positive direction with increasing @xmath98 and passes through zero at a finite @xmath98,@xcite implying that the time - independent small - current solution is unstable and a spatially nonuniform@xcite or a time - dependent solution@xcite may develop , which exhibits measured zero resistance .",
    "therefore we identify the region where a negative dissipative magnetoresistance develops as that of the zrs .",
    "the summations over @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eqs.([eqf0 ] ) , ( [ eqsp ] ) and ( [ eqw ] ) include all possible electron transition processes assisted by real and virtual photons of frequency @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath99 terms represent all possible electron transitions with simultaneous absorption of @xmath27 photons of frequency @xmath1 , while @xmath100 terms represent all possible electron transitions with simultaneous emission of @xmath101 photons of frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we call these electron transitions the @xmath101 @xmath1-photon assisted processes .",
    "the same for @xmath102 @xmath2-photon assisted processes .",
    "the @xmath103 terms represent electron transitions assisted by virtual @xmath1-photons ( all possible emission and absorption of same number of @xmath1-photons ) , and @xmath104 terms represent electron transitions assisted by virtual @xmath2-photons .",
    "as indicated by experiments,@xcite in ultra - clean gaas - based 2d samples having mobility of order of @xmath105m@xmath106/vs , the remote donor scattering is responsible for merely @xmath107 or less of the total momentum scattering rate .",
    "the dominant contribution to the momentum scattering comes from short - range scatterers such as residual impurities or defects in the background .",
    "therefore , as in ref . , we assume that the dominant elastic scatterings contributing to the resistance and energy absorption are due to short - range impurities randomly distributed throughout the gaas region in the numerical calculations .",
    "the impurity densities are determined by the requirement that electron total linear mobility at zero magnetic field equals the giving value at lattice temperature @xmath76 . since rimo measurements are at low temperatures , the direct phonon contributions to @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( @xmath0 ) can be neglected . nevertheless , to calculate the electron energy dissipation to the lattice , @xmath110 , we take account of scatterings from bulk longitudinal acoustic ( la ) and transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons ( via the deformation potential and piezoelectric couplings ) , as well as from longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons ( via the frhlich coupling ) in the gaas - based system .",

    "new peak - valley pairs appear .",
    "their amplitudes generally increase with increasing the incident field strengths as indicated in the figure .",
    "most of these pairs exhibit essentially fixed node positions while growing amplitudes and their minima can drop down into negative .",
    "as in the case of monochromatic illumination , the appearance of magnetoresistance oscillation in the bichromatic irradiation comes from real photon - assisted electron transitions between different landau levels as indicated in the summation of the electron density - correlation function in eq.([pi_2 ] ) .",
