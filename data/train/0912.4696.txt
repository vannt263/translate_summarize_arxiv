    "in the last three decades , there was an enormous progress in our understanding of the sun .",
    "the predictions of the standard solar model ( ssm ) , which is the fundamental theoretical tool to investigate the solar interior , have been tested by solar neutrino experiments and by helioseismology .",
    "the deficit of the observed solar neutrino fluxes , reported initially by homestake @xcite and then confirmed by gallex @xcite and sage @xcite ( which subsequently merged into gno @xcite ) , kamiokande @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite , generated the so - called `` solar neutrino problem '' which stimulated a deep investigation of the solar structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the problem was solved in 2002 when the sno experiment @xcite obtained a direct evidence for flavour oscillations of solar neutrinos and , moreover , confirmed the ssm prediction of the @xmath0 neutrino flux with an accuracy which , according to the latest data @xcite , is equal to about @xmath1 ( see e.g. @xcite ) solar neutrino flux has been obtained in 2001 ( see e.g. @xcite ) by comparing the sno charged - current result @xcite with the sk data with the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "the year 2002 is , however , recognized as the annus mirabilis @xcite for the solar neutrino physics . during 2002 , in fact , the sno neutral - current measurement @xcite and the first kamland results @xcite were released and , moreover , raymond davis , jr . and masatoshi koshiba were awarded with the nobel prize . ] .    at the same time",
    ", helioseismic observations have allowed to determine precisely several important properties of the sun , such as the depth of the convective envelope which is known at the @xmath2 level , the surface helium abundance which is obtained at the @xmath3 level and the sound speed profile which is determined with an accuracy equal to @xmath4 in a large part of the sun ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . as a results of these observations ,",
    "the solar structure is now very well constrained , so that the sun can be used as a solid benchmark for stellar evolution and as a `` laboratory '' for fundamental physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the future times could be even more interesting .",
    "kamland reactor ( anti)neutrino experiment @xcite has confirmed the flavour oscillations hypothesis and has refined the determination of neutrino parameters .",
    "we now reliably know the solar neutrino oscillation probability and we can go back to the original program of solar neutrino studies , i.e. to probe nuclear reactions in the solar core .",
    "the present and future solar neutrino experiments , such as borexino @xcite and sno+ @xcite , have the potential to provide the first direct measurements of the cno and pep neutrinos , thus probing dominant and sub - dominant energy generation mechanisms in the sun .    at the same time",
    ", a new solar problem has emerged .",
    "recent determinations of the photospheric heavy element abundances @xcite indicate that the sun metallicity is lower than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "solar models that incorporate these lower abundances are no more able to reproduce the helioseismic results . as an example , the sound speed predicted by ssms at the bottom of the convective envelope disagrees at the @xmath5 level with the value inferred by helioseismic data ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "detailed studies have been done to resolve this controversy ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but a definitive solution of the `` solar composition problem '' still has to be obtained .    in this framework , it is important to analyze of the role of physical inputs and of the standard assumptions for ssm calculations .",
    "this task is not always possible in simple and clear terms , since ssm construction relies on ( time - consuming ) numerical integration of a non linear system of partial differential equations .",
    "several input parameters are necessary to fully describe the property of the solar plasma and some of them are not single numbers but complicated functions ( like e.g. the opacity of the solar interior ) which , in principle , can be modified in a non trivial way . moreover",
    ", any modification of the sun produces a variety of correlated effects which have to be taken into account all together if we want to correctly extract information from the comparison of theoretical predictions with observational data .    in order to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we provide a tool which is at same time simple and accurate enough to describe the effects of a generic ( small ) modification of the physical inputs . the starting point is the fact that , despite the present disagreement with helioseismic data , the ssm is a rather good approximation of the real sun .",
    "we can thus assume small variations of the physical and chemical properties of the sun with respect to the ssm predictions and use a linear theory to relate them to the properties of the solar plasma . with the additional assumption that the ( variation of ) the present solar composition can be estimated from the ( variation of ) the nuclear reaction rate and elemental diffusion efficiency in the present sun , we obtain a linear system of ordinary differential equations , which can be easily integrated .",
    "we believe that the proposed approach can be useful in several respects .",
    "first , the construction of these linear solar models ( lsm ) can complement the traditional methods for solar model calculations , allowing to investigate in a more efficient and transparent way the role of parameters and assumptions . in a separated paper",
    ", we will use lsms to discuss in general terms the role of opacity and metals in the solar interior @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can help to introduce new effects and to understand their relevance , prior to the implementation into the more complicated ssm machinery .",
    "finally , this simplified approach could open the field of solar physics beyond the small community of the ssm s builders with the result of making the sun a more accessible `` laboratory '' .",
    "clearly , lsms have not to be intended as an alternative to ssms , which remain the fundamental theoretical tool to compare with observations .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section we briefly review ssm calculations . in sect.[linear ] we expand to linear order the structure equations of the present sun . in sect.[properties ]",
    "we calculate the properties of the sun and of the solar plasma that are necessary to define lsms . in sect.[boundary ] we give the integration conditions for the linearized equations . in sect.[chemical ] , we discuss how to estimate the chemical composition of the sun . in sect.[fullset ] we give the equations that define lsms in their final form .",
    "finally , in sect.[comparison ] we compare the results of lsms with those obtained by using the standard method for solar model calculations , showing the validity of our simplified approach .",
    "in the assumption of spherical symmetry , the behavior of the pressure ( @xmath6 ) , density ( @xmath7 ) , temperature ( @xmath8 ) , luminosity ( @xmath9 ) and mass ( @xmath10 ) in the sun is described by the structure equations @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates the distance from the center , @xmath13 is the energy produced per unit time and mass , the function @xmath14 describes the equation of state ( eos ) of solar matter and @xmath15 are the mass abundances of the various chemical elements inside the sun . in the equation which describes the energy transport , the temperature gradient @xmath16",
    "is defined as @xmath17 .",
    "if the energy transfer is due to radiative processes ( i.e. at the center of the sun ) one has : @xmath18 where the radiative gradient @xmath19 is given by : @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the opacity of solar matter . in the presence of convective motions ( i.e. in the outer layer of the sun ) , the value of @xmath16 has to be calculated by taking into account the convective energy transport which generally provides the dominant contribution . in a large part of the sun convective envelope , one has @xmath22 this is expected when convection is very efficient and a negligible excess of @xmath16 over the adiabatic value @xmath23 is sufficient to transport the whole luminosity . in the outermost layers of the sun , the situation is more complicated .",
    "the precise description of convection in this regime is still an unsolved problem .",
    "one uses a phenomenological model which predicts the efficiency of convection as a function of the `` mixing length parameter '' @xmath24 , which is related to the distances over which a moving unit of gas can be identified before it mixes appreciably ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the transition between the internal radiative core and the external convective envelope occurs at the radius @xmath25 where : @xmath26 as it is prescribed by the schwarzschild criterion which states that convective motions occur in the region of the star where @xmath27 .    the chemical composition of the present sun is not known but has to be calculated by coupling eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , which describe the mechanical and thermal structure , with the equations that describe the chemical evolution of the sun ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) . it is generally assumed that the sun was born chemically homogeneous and has modified its chemical composition due to nuclear reactions and elemental diffusion .",
    "one assumes that _ relative _ heavy element abundances in the photosphere have not been modified during the evolution and uses the observationally determined photospheric composition ( see e.g. @xcite ) to fix the initial heavy element admixture .",
    "we remark that the chemical abundances are uniform in the convective region due to the very efficient mixing induced by convective motions .",
    "the values @xmath28 , evaluated at the bottom of the convective region , are , thus , representative for the solar surface composition .",
    "if a complete information about the initial composition was available and if a complete theory of convection was known , then there would be no free parameter . in practice",
    ", one has three free parameters , namely the initial metal abundance @xmath29 , the initial helium abundance @xmath30 and the mixing length parameter @xmath24 .",
    "these are tuned in order to reproduce , at the solar age @xmath31 @xcite , the observed solar luminosity @xmath32erg / s @xcite , the observed solar radius @xmath33 cm @xcite and the surface metal - to - hydrogen ratio @xmath34 . in this paper",
    "we use the as05 composition @xcite which corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "a standard solar model ( ssm ) , according to the definition of @xcite , is a solution of the above problem which reproduces , within uncertainties , the observed properties of the sun , by adopting physical and chemical inputs chosen within their range of uncertainties . in this paper , we refer to the ssm obtained by using franec code @xcite , including : livermore 2006 equation of state ( eos ) @xcite ; livermore radiative opacity tables ( opal ) @xcite calculated for the as05 chemical composition ; molecular opacities from ref .",

    "a variation of the input parameters ( eos , opacities , cross sections , etc . ) with respect to the standard assumptions produces a solar model which deviates from ssm predictions .",
