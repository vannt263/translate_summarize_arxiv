    "the situation is more complex , and optimal solutions have not been proposed to date , mainly due to the fact that the superposition of many spectral components in most cases tend to broaden the focal spot .",
    "theoretically , one may hope to be able to focus strongly confined pulses as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the aperture field and medium required remains elusive . however , there are a few promising pathways , e.g. , using rainbow - colored apertures which combine to a single white - colored focus@xcite or diffractive optical elements@xcite .",
    "well developed theories and numerical algorithms are available for studying monochromatic and polychromatic waves in focal regions@xcite , but they do not provide direct insight into the reverse engineering problem and may not provide a fast solution or be optimal with the minimal amount of information given . under such circumstances",
    "it is necessary to have straightforward methods which allows backtracking of the signal in a manner such that the initial field resulting in a strong focus is found . in this work",
    "we present a method to find the most strongly focused field . here",
    "we extend the applicability of reverse phase and amplitude engineering beyond previous approaches , and apply our method to monochromatic , polychromatic and diffusive waves .",
    "we start by considering a related problem , namely the diffusion of a field in region of space containing no sources .",
    "the diffusion equation then describes the field according to @xmath0 where d is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the field can now be written on the following general form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fourier amplitude .",
    "usually , a solution of eq .",
    "[ hhh ] will represent a diffusion process where the field delocalizes with increasing time .",
    "however , we are here interested in finding a field @xmath3 with an optimally localized field @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . to see how one may design such an initial field ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath6 is a constant for @xmath7 and zero for @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the field is given by @xmath9 the real value of eq .",
    "[ hh ] at @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 whereas at @xmath12 it is @xmath13 by selecting @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , we see that the leading contribution to @xmath16 , which is an oscillatory function with period @xmath17 . thus , the field at @xmath10 is strongly delocalized , but with sharp local fluctuations , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] a ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath4 is strongly localized with a central lobe @xmath18 , but is a factor @xmath19 smaller than the field at @xmath10 . a sharp localization is therefore obtained at the expense of an exponential reduction in field amplitude .",
    "the procedure introduced above can be straightforwardly applied to scalar monochromatic waves satisfying the helmholtz equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the wavenumber , @xmath22 is the angular frequency and @xmath23 is the velocity of light in the medium under consideration . using the angular spectrum representation ,",
    "the field can be written as @xmath24 where the angular spectrum is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 here @xmath27 represent the homogenous plane waves , whereas @xmath28 correspond to inhomogeneous or evanescent plane waves that propagate in the @xmath29 direction and decay in the z - direction .",
    "the trick is now to express the angular spectrum as @xmath30 where we must again require @xmath31 to be bandlimited ( i.e. nonzero only in a range @xmath32 ) and converges sufficiently quickly such that the solution for the field does not possess any unphysical divergency problem .",
    "this was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the field at the focal point ( @xmath33 ) is now given by @xmath34 i.e. a fourier transform of the aperture function @xmath35 resulting in a finite resolution at the focal point .",

    "thus , we have shown that the proposed method is in line with the theoretical observations made in e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for focusing of evanescent waves to subwavelength spots or lines .",
    "notice that the aperture field is much stronger than the field in the focal region , i.e. @xmath48 . if we assume that @xmath49 , a possible criterium for focusing could be obtained by requiring that the aperture intensity ( at @xmath33 ) envelope at @xmath50 , corresponding to the position with half the maximum intensity , should be wider than the focused intensity distribution of half - width @xmath51 .",
    "thus , by requiring @xmath52 , we ensure that the field is focused . at the same time",

    "an interesting question is whether the method above can be applied directly to polychromatic waves ( e.g. pulsed waves ) . to investigate this point ,",
    "let us consider a time - dependent scalar field described by the wave equation as @xmath59 in the angular spectrum representation , the field can be expressed as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62    in order to bring the polychromatic waves to focus we require that every spectral component is at focus a certain distance @xmath63 from the aperture at a given time @xmath64 .",
    "this can be done by compensating the time and space parts of the phase separately , or by requiring a cross - compensation .",
    "the first alternative requires that we set @xmath65 which results in @xmath66 it is seen that the field in focus @xmath67 is now just a sum over the frequencies of perfectly focused monochromatic wave components , which will be smeared out to a spot determined by the smallest wave vector of the spectrum ( the largest wavelength in the case of homogeneous waves ) . in principle the procedure to find the aperture field is the same as that considered above for monochromatic waves .",
    "unfortunately , it does not lend itself to immediate insight ( except in the case of a rectangular spectrum for both @xmath68 and @xmath22 , which results in similar fields as those given above ) , must in most cases be evaluated numerically , and will therefore not be pursued further here .",
    "the second alternative is to require cross - compensation of the phase , which amounts to setting @xmath69 , which basically states that the spatial part of the phase is compensated by the temporal part at @xmath70 .",
    "such a requirement can only be fulfilled if @xmath22 depends on the spatial frequencies ( i.e. direction of each plane wave ) , where the angular frequency is given by @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the fact that frequency of the spatial wave vector depends on the direction was utilized in ref . @xcite to combine a rainbow spectrum to a single , focused spot .",
    "conceptually the idea presented here is somewhat similar , although we use an entirely different approach to achieve the goal .",
    "note that we must distinguish between the two cases @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath74 .",
    "this can occur if the phase velocity of the wave exceeds the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we then observe that @xmath76 is real and given by @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the scalar field is then given by @xmath79 it is seen that the fields are time and space - shifted such that @xmath80 gives transversal coordinate for the focal line .",
    "this suggests that the temporal field at @xmath81 can be imaged perfectly onto planes where @xmath82 .",
    "our theory has implicitly assumed , as is the case for all real systems , a bandlimited angular spectrum , e.g. nonzero in @xmath83 . as an example , assume that @xmath84 ( i.e. constant ) in @xmath83 , such that the field is given by @xmath85 \\right\\}}{x+\\alpha \\left ( t-\\frac{z}{v_1 } \\right ) } \\,\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{f}\\ ] ] we notice that due to the peculiar dispersion relationship required by the phase matching , the waves propagate as a light sheet located at the plane @xmath86 . at the aperture",
    ", we require a pulse traveling in the negative x - direction . oblique light sheets ( in the case of electromagnetic waves ) are then propagating outwards at an angle @xmath87 with the aperture .",
    "it should be noted that upon imposing the requirement @xmath77 without requiring additional boundary or media restrictions we obtain light sheets which somewhat unphysically extend to infinity ( this problem could be removed by considering a more precise theory for causal and spatially dispersive media , but such an adventure is outside the scope of the current study ) . only in the case @xmath88 they are confined to the aperture plane at @xmath10 , but this requires that a small change in the spatial frequency generates a very large change in frequency , thus putting significant constraints on the medium to be use .",

    "[ evantime ] is identical to eq.[perf ] if we set @xmath97 , and is therefore just a translation of the evanescent wave along the optical axis with the intensity distribution similar to that of fig .",
    "since we require @xmath98 , which is fulfilled if we , as an example , set @xmath99 , the half - width of the intensity distribution at the traveling focal line is narrower than @xmath100 .",
    "when @xmath101 our approximate theory for evanescent waves does not longer hold in the vicinity of @xmath55 ( this follows from the considerations above ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion about diverging solutions ) , where the intensity grows as @xmath102 with time .",
    "the fact that the evanescent wave does not change at the focal line @xmath103 is surprising , given the condition @xmath104 above .",

    "that is , consider an observer moving at a speed @xmath23 relative to a fixed frame . according to einstein",
    "s special theory of relativity , the moving observer will detect a frequency @xmath109 given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111@xcite . from the above it",
    "may be inferred that this expression corresponds to @xmath112 if we make the associations @xmath113 and @xmath114 , i.e. the phase factor @xmath115 must be associated with the frequency measured in the moving frame . in the special case considered in this study @xmath116 , which corresponds to @xmath117 . for propagating waves we may set @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the real angle at which a specific plane wave makes with the direction of motion .",
