    "studies of fermionic atoms gained momentum after these experiments realized pure fermionic bcs states  @xcite , as well as the bcs - bec crossover that was predicted theoretically a decade earlier  @xcite .",
    "the formation of fermi superfluids were realized by the use of strong four fermion interactions caused by tuning a homogeneous magnetic field close to the feshbach resonance of the confined atoms  @xcite .",
    "such strong interactions are difficult to generate with bosonic atoms due to three body losses",
    ". however , three body losses are significantly lower with fermions due to the pauli principle .",
    "theoretical interest in fermi superfluid dynamics paralleled experiments involving dynamical phenomena .",

    "the literature can be broadly divided into two kinds , one that looks at the macroscopic dynamics of the order parameters , covered in section  [ sec : myoldstuff ] , and one that looks at the dynamics of the microscopic degrees of freedom , covered in section  [ sec : fermidyn ] . in the former case ,",
    "the excited quasiparticles in the bogoliubov de - gennes spectrum of the superfluid relax very quickly compared to the relaxation of the time dependent superfluid gap @xmath5 , and excitations of the quasimolecular states relax similarly  @xcite .",

    "this section details studies of the dynamics of the macroscopic order parameters that arise from the microscopic bcs - bec hamiltonian .",
    "studies of these regimes have been motivated by the bcs - bec crossover , where the renormalized interaction between the cooper pairs changes sign , and the size of the cooper pairs decrease .",
    "these pairs eventually become diatomic molecules that obey bose statistics and can form a bose einstein condensate . the equilibrium equation of state of the macroscopic order parameters",

    "the dynamics of ultracold fermi superfluids can be understood by approximate models based on how the time scales of the dynamics compare to the relaxation of the quasiparticles of the equilibrium bcs hamiltonian .",
    "the order parameter relaxes at a rate given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the macroscopic bcs energy gap responsible for superconducting / superfluid behavior .",
    "when this relaxes much more slowly than the energies of the quasiparticles , they reach their equilibrium quickly and the nonequilibrium state can be characterized by the macroscopic order parameters .",
