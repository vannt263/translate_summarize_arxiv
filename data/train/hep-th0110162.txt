    "in recent years large extra dimensions which can only be probed by gravitons and eventually non - standard matter have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "these models usually yield the correct newtonian @xmath2-potential at large distances because the gravitational field is quenched on submillimeter transverse scales .",
    "this quenching appears either due to finite extension of the transverse dimensions @xcite or due to submillimeter transverse curvature scales induced by negative cosmological constants @xcite . a common feature of both of these types of models and also of the old kaluza ",
    "klein type models is the prediction of deviations from four - dimensional einstein gravity at short distances .",
    "if the transverse length scale is not too small this implies the possibility to generate bulk gravitons in accelerators @xcite or stars @xcite .    in this regard the recent model of dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) @xcite ( see also @xcite for extensions )",
    "is very different : it predicts that four - dimensional einstein gravity is a short - distance phenomenon with deviations showing up at large distances .",
    "the transition between four- and higher - dimensional gravitational potentials in the dgp model arises as a consequence of the presence of both brane and bulk einstein terms in the action .",
    "furthermore , it was observed in @xcite that the dgp model allows for an embedding of standard friedmann cosmology in the sense that the cosmological evolution of the background metric on the brane can entirely be described by the standard friedmann equation plus energy conservation on the brane .",
    "this was later generalized to arbitrary number of transverse dimensions in @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ cosmology ] i review the standard embedding of friedmann cosmology found in @xcite , and describe in particular the realization of a ( dust @xmath0 @xmath1)-dominated universe in this framework .",
    "the action of the dgp model reads @xmath3 @xmath4 where gaussian normal coordinates are employed : @xmath5 the transverse coordinate @xmath6 is a distance along orthogonal geodesics to the brane .",
    "the @xmath7-dimensional submanifold @xmath8 is usually denoted as a 3-brane , and @xmath9 contains the matter degrees of freedom on this brane .",
    "extrinsic curvature effects have been taken into account through a gibbons  hawking term @xcite ( which requires averaging over the two sides of the brane @xcite ) , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are reduced planck masses in five and four dimensions , respectively .",
    "the action ( [ actiondgp ] ) yields einstein equations @xmath12 @xmath13 corresponding to matching conditions @xmath14_{x^\\perp = -\\epsilon}^{x^\\perp = \\epsilon}= \\left.\\frac{1}{m_4 ^ 3}\\left(t_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{d-1 } g_{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\alpha\\beta}t_{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)\\right|_{x^\\perp = 0}\\ ] ] @xmath15 for the extrinsic curvature of the brane .",
    "the use of gaussian normal coordinates ( [ metric ] ) implies that we can impose a harmonic gauge condition only on the longitudinal coordinates @xmath16 : @xmath17 but this is sufficient to get a decoupled equation for the gravitational potential of a static mass distribution : + the transverse equations in the gauge ( [ hggauss ] ) @xmath18 @xmath19 can be solved by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the remaining equations take the form @xmath22 @xmath23 this yields the equation for the gravitational potential of a mass density @xmath24 on @xmath25 : @xmath26    the resulting potential on the brane is @xcite @xmath27 @xmath28,\\ ] ] with the sine and cosine integrals @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 the dgp model thus predicts a transition scale @xmath31 between four - dimensional behavior and five - dimensional behavior of the gravitational potential : @xmath32 , \\\\",

    "if we would use the usual value of the reduced planck mass for @xmath11 , then the small @xmath34 potential would be stronger than the genuine four - dimensional potential by a factor @xmath35 because the coupling of the masses on the brane to the four - dimensional ricci tensor is increased by this factor .",
    "this factor @xmath35 is in agreement with the tensorial structure of the graviton propagator reported in @xcite .",
    "therefore the four - dimensional reduced planck mass is slightly larger in the dgp model than in ordinary einstein gravity : @xmath36    the potential is displayed in fig . 1 .",
    "[ fig : dggpot ]    the current limit on deviations from einstein gravity at _ large distances _ is still set by @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath37 m would translate with ( [ ldgp],[modplanck ] ) into a bulk planck mass @xmath38gev . this may seem surprisingly low , but recall from ( [ udgp ] ) that the relevant graviton coupling scale at distances well below @xmath39 is the large planck mass @xmath11 on the brane , and lower @xmath10 means larger @xmath39 , making it even harder to detect any deviations from einstein gravity .",
    "it is certainly easy to constrain @xmath39 to supergalactic scales , because the dgp model predicts a weakening of gravity at large distances , thus potentially increasing the need for dark matter .",
    "however , interest in this model does not arise from the hope that one might detect any corresponding effects at galactic or not too large supergalactic scales : the interest in the model results from the observation that it provides a simple , yet surprising mechanism to accomodate four - dimensional gravity in a model with infinitely large extra dimensions .",
    "from the fact that the dgp model predicts deviations only at large distances one might hope that it could be ruled out from cosmological observations , but we will see that it can account for standard friedmann cosmology at any distance scale on the brane :    brane cosmology usually starts from the line element ( with @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) @xmath42 @xmath43 this _ ansatz _ implies a brane cosmological principle in that it assumes that every hypersurface @xmath44 const .",

    "building on the results of @xcite , the cosmological evolution equations of a 3-brane in a five - dimensional bulk following from ( [ einsteindgp ] ) and ( [ lanczosdgp ] ) were presented in @xcite .    here",
    "i will follow @xcite and give the results for a brane of dimension @xmath46 .",

    "however , eq .  ( [ 0perp0 ] ) implies @xmath73 , and therefore @xmath74 this , the bulk equations @xmath75 , and the constancy of @xmath76 imply that the bulk equation @xmath72 is already satisfied and does not provide any new information .",
    "we can now simplify the previous equations by further restricting our gaussian normal coordinates through the gauge @xmath77 by simply performing the transformation @xmath78 of the time coordinate .",
    "this gauge is convenient because it gives the usual cosmological time on the brane .",
    "henceforth this gauge will be adopted , but the index frw will be omitted .",

    "the constants @xmath76 must be considered as initial conditions , and if e.g. @xmath86 , then there can not be any symmetry across the brane .    if @xmath87 and the normal derivatives on the brane have the same sign : @xmath88 then the cosmology of our brane approximates ordinary friedmann ",
    "walker cosmology during those epochs when @xmath89 in particular , this applies to late epochs in expanding open or flat branes ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "standard cosmology may be realized in the dgp model in an even more direct way :    if ( [ ordincond ] ) holds and @xmath91 , then ( [ friedmann1 ] ) reduces _ entirely _ to the ordinary friedmann equation for a @xmath92-dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "this embedding of standard friedmann cosmology is then given by the following set of cosmological evolution equations : +    the evolution of the background geometry of the observable universe according to the friedmann equation can thus be embedded in the dgp model , with the bevavior of @xmath79 off the brane determined solely by the integral @xmath93 and the boundary condition @xmath82 from the friedmann equation",
    ".    this embedding will be asymmetric in all realistic cases , because the requirement that the friedmann equation holds on the brane is equivalent to the smoothness condition @xmath94 this could yield a symmetric embedding only for @xmath95 , but this is incompatible with the time - independence of the integral @xmath93 ( apart from the exotic case @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) . and _ vice versa _ : the previously often employed assumption that embeddings would have to be symmetric implied a cusp at the brane and a corresponding violation of the friedmann equation on the brane .",
    "observation of the hubble flow thus might have had observable consequences on brane cosmology , see @xcite for a discussion of this , but in the present embedding scenarios the hubble flow can not rule out brane scenarios .    in the sequel we will choose the sign of @xmath98 in the direction of increasing scale factor :",
    "the possibility of a direct embedding of friedmann cosmology is a consequence of the fact that the evolution of the background geometry ( [ cosprinc ] ) and the source terms @xmath100 , @xmath101 are supposed to depend only on @xmath102 and @xmath98 .",
    "this implies the possibility to decouple the brane and the bulk contributions in the einstein equation for the background metric , and in this case deviations from friedmann ",
    "walker cosmology would only show up in specific @xmath103-dependent effects like the evolution of cosmological perturbations and structure formation .    in the relevant case @xmath104 we find from the second equation @xmath105 and from the equation for @xmath80 , the solutions for the metric components off the brane in terms of the metric on the brane ( with the sign convention from ( [ eq : sign ] ) ) : @xmath106 @xmath107\\ ] ] @xmath108^{-1/2}.\\ ] ]    this embedding of friedmann cosmology on the brane becomes particularly simple for @xmath109 : @xmath110 @xmath111      for early universe cosmology spatial curvature and the cosmological constant are negligible compared to the radiation dominated matter density .",
    "the energy density and scale factor on the brane evolve in the standard way @xmath112 @xmath113 and the metric off the brane is given by @xcite @xmath114 and @xmath115 this yields in particular for @xmath109 : @xmath116 @xmath117    there appear coordinate singularities on the spacelike hypercone @xmath118 .",
    "this is presumably a consequence of the fact that the orthogonal geodesics emerging from the brane ( which we used to set up our gaussian normal system ) do not cover the full five - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the evolution of the background metric in a ( dust @xmath0 @xmath1)-dominated universe is readily inferred from energy conservation and the friedmann equation .",
    "the energy density in the dust evolves according to    @xmath119    and the scale factor on the brane is @xmath120    from subsection [ sec : general ] it is clear that minimal embeddings correspond to @xmath109 , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : axti=0],[eq : nxti=0 ] ) yield @xmath121,\\ ] ] @xmath122 @xmath123x^\\perp.\\ ] ]    this solution has to be smoothly connected to the corresponding radiation dominated solution if aspects of the hubble flow at matter  radiation equality are examined .",
    "however , for later times the corresponding shift in @xmath102 is negligible .",
    "brane models provide a somewhat exotic , yet interesting extension of our parameter space for gravitational theories . we have seen that even standard friedmann cosmology on the brane can be accomodated by brane models with einstein terms both on the brane and in the bulk , thus implying that cosmological tests of these models should come from structure formation , where the dgp model should have problems due to the weakening of gravity at large distances .",
    "another matter of concern for brane models in general are gauge fields .",
    "while it may be mathematically possible to restrict non - gravitational terms in the action _ a priori _ to brane contributions , logically this may not seem entirely satisfactory .",
    "it is relatively easy to limit the penetration depth for scalars and fermions , but i am not aware of any satisfactory mechanism to constrain the penetration depth of time - dependent gauge fields ( static sources are no problem , see @xcite ) .    still , it is of interest to study the properties of these models : brane models like the dgp model provide a framework for extensions of the brane models of string theory to infinitely large transverse dimensions , thus potentially shedding new light on the dimensionality problem in string theory . + * acknowledgement : * i would like to thank marek biesiada and the organizers of the xxv international school of theoretical physics for discussions and their very kind hospitality .",
