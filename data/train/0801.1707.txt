    "here we present results from an ongoing project aimed at simulating a representative sample of galaxies that form in a @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "simulations are run with gasoline @xcite and use the `` blastwave feedback '' described in @xcite .",
    "three of the four models presented here use the same initial conditions as in governato et al .",
    "( 2007 , g07 ) and thus the galaxy halos have the same merging history and form inside the same large scale structure . however , these new simulations use 8 times more resolution elements and a 50% smaller force softening than those presented in g07 . to understand the numerical limitations of our work and to better compare with the existing literature ,",
    "we vary the number of resolution elements and the feedback implementations . in one case ( named mw1 ) we run three models with the number of resolution elements varying from a few tens of thousand to a few million particles and force resolution from 1.2kpc to 0.3kpc . to allow a straightforward comparison between simulations and observations , the galaxies b / d ratios and disk scale lengths",
    "are measured using galfit on dust reddened , face - on i and k band artificial images produced using sunrise @xcite .",
    "recent works by different groups and using different hydrodynamical codes have highlighted the role of feedback in creating galaxies with a dominant stellar component supported by rotation @xcite .",
    "significant improvements have been made in reproducing a number of scaling properties of late type galaxies : namely the age - circular velocity , the tully fisher , the stellar mass - metallicity relations and the abundance of galaxy satellites @xcite .",
    "however , a well known problem of most galaxies formed in cosmological simulations is a massive , centrally concentrated spheroidal component that creates unrealistically declining rotation curves @xcite .",
    "the explanations proposed in the literature invoke both physical and numerical arguments : catastrophic angular momentum loss due to dynamical friction suffered by gas rich subhalos @xcite , spurious gravitational torques between the disk and the surrounding halo of dark matter and gas caused by the noisy mass distribution at low resolution @xcite , or artificial pressure gradients at the cold / hot gas interface @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     sn feedback is a promising solution as it decouples baryons from the dark matter ( zavala et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "however , @xcite recently presented results from simulations that did not include feedback from sne : the resulting circular velocity profile of their simulated galaxies changed significantly with increasing resolution , with the peak velocity dropping from 320 km / sec to 220 when the number of particles was increased from 40@xmath1 to 200@xmath1 ( their fig.1 ) .",
    "@xcite used simulations of isolated galaxies to show that cold , rotationally supported disks lose a large fraction of thier initial angular momentum if the number of gas particles is below @xmath2 .",
    "the literature presents encouraging evidence that both a physically motivated description of feedback and a high number of resolution elements help to form galaxies with at least some of the properties of the real ones . however , an analysis of a uniform sample of simulations with techniques _ directly comparable _ to those used by observers ( who measure the light rather than the underlying mass distribution ) has been lacking , making a comparison between observations and theoretical models more open to interpretation .",
    "to show the separate effects of feedback and resolution we focus on a simulation of a milky way like galaxy ( total halo mass 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "the disk , halo and bulge components are first identified based on their kinematics ( brook et al 08 , in prep ) .",
    "all runs adopted the `` blastwave '' feedback , but those named `` th '' , that use the much less effective `` thermal '' feedback @xcite which is a lower limit to the possible effects of feedback ( the two methods inject the same amount of energy into the icm ) .",
    "all runs include the effects of a uniform cosmic uv background .",
    "the kinematically defined stellar disk component becomes more dominant as resolution increases or a physically realistic description of feedback effects is adopted ( fig.1a ) .",
    "bulge masses decrease significantly in the high resolution run with feedback ( hr vs mr and & mr - th ) .",
    "feedback is also particularly effective in reducing the fraction of halo stars , a consequence of a smaller stellar mass in stripped galaxy satellites ( mr vs. mr - th ) ( brook et al 04 ) .",
    "fig.1b shows the circular velocity profile ( v@xmath5(r ) = @xmath6 ) for the same galaxy as resolution and feedback are varied and shows results consistent with those in @xcite and kaufmann et al ( 2007 ) : higher resolution models are less centrally concentrated .",
    "while this plot emphasizes the role of resolution , we have verified that effect of feedback on the mass distribution is larger in less massive halos with a shallower potential well , consistent with zavala et al ( 2007 ) .    after a bulge / disk decomposition with galfit , photometric , dust reddened i - band disks",
    "have larger scale lengths ( r@xmath7 ) and galaxies have bluer colors in higher resolution runs that include the blastwave feedback ( table 1 and fig.3 ) .",
    "fig.2a shows the rotation curves from cold gas or young stars for the high resolution version of the galaxies in g07 .",
    "compared with the lower resolution models in g07 rotation curves are flatter , as the very central regions are less dense and the disks dynamically colder in the outer parts .",
    "however , they are still not as flat as those of most real galaxies of similar mass .",
    "fig.2b shows the resulting i - band tully fisher relation .",
    "v@xmath8 is measured at 3.5 r@xmath7 .",
    "there is good agreement between data and the high resolution models , confirming results in g07 , while the low res mw1 model is significantly shifted to the right compared to its high resolution equivalent and the observed distribution .",
    "we added to the sample a recently simulated large spiral galaxy with an r@xmath7 of 9.2 , 9.2 and 9.1 kpc in the b , i and k bands respectively .",
    "its dust reddened i - band b / d is = 0.64 ."
