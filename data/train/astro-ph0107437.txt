    "_  , this leads to the interesting result that the cosmological change in the proportion of halos that have undergone recent merger is predicted to be independent of power spectrum , halo mass , mass function , and to only depend on the friedmann cosmology through @xmath105 . in section  [ sec : obs ] it was argued that the field galaxy merger rate should be driven by the halo merger rate , and that observations of field galaxies estimate the cosmological evolution in the halo merger rate . in section",

    "<S> this strengthens previous work , which also found the build - up of halos in simulations to be well matched to ps theory with a sharp @xmath0-space filter by providing a direct comparison of different filters and by extending the statistical tools used to analyse halo mass growth . </S>",
