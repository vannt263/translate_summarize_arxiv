    "the success of the @xmath1cdm paradigm of cosmological structure formation in reproducing the observed structure of the universe on scales @xmath2mpc is now well - established ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , on the scale of individual galaxies ( @xmath3kpc ) the density profiles of dark matter haloes pose a potentially significant problem .",
    "the form of these profiles in the absence of baryonic physics has been extensively studied by means of numerical simulations . @xcite and @xcite showed that haloes on a range of mass scales have similar profiles , with the density in the innermost regions exhibiting an @xmath4 cusp .",
    "more recent work has found that the haloes can be better represented by profiles with either slightly shallower inner cusp slopes @xcite or continuously varying slope , for example the @xcite profile @xcite .",
    "however , there is mounting observational evidence that galaxies occupy dark - matter haloes with almost uniform density cores with the strongest evidence coming from low surface brightness galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "although there have been fewer such studies in high surface brightness spirals , recent work by @xcite has shown that in these galaxies also cored haloes are favoured . even in low - luminosity ,",
    "pressure supported systems such as the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies surrounding the milky way , there is circumstantial evidence that their haloes are not cusped @xcite .",
    "it is important to remember however , that the ignorance of baryonic physics in the aforementioned simulations constitutes a significant limitation with regard to any discussion of the inner halo profiles .",
    "the inclusion of baryon physics is widely recognised as a crucial , albeit extremely technically challenging prerequisite for further progress in understanding galaxy formation .",
    "there are multiple ways in which the baryons can affect the density profile of a dark matter halo .",
    "first , a cloud of gas which initially extends throughout a cusped dark matter halo can dissipate energy by radiation and contract to the centre of the halo .",
    "as the dark matter responds to the deeper gravitational potential , this in turn leads to a steepening of the dark matter cusp , known as adiabatic contraction @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily the end of the story , however , as baryons also have the ability to generate mass outflows driven by stellar winds and supernovae produced as a result of star formation .",
    "depending on the efficiency of star formation , such processes can expel a significant fraction of the baryonic mass from the central regions of a galaxy , resulting in a large - scale rearrangement of the dark matter . using semi - analytic arguments",
    ", @xcite found that when stellar mass loss was preceded by adiabatic contraction , the resulting halo distribution was almost unchanged from its original cusped profile .",
    "@xcite , however , subsequently showed that repeated episodes of adiabatic contraction followed by rapid mass expulsion could give rise to a reduction in the central density and hence produce cored haloes .",
    "this occurs because although the initial infall / outflow produces the same mass density profile , the velocity structure of the dark matter halo after the outflow is biased towards radial orbits . as a result ,",
    "subsequent events are able to lower the inner density more easily .",
    "another way in which the baryonic component of a galaxy can transfer energy to the dark matter halo is by means of a stellar bar .",
    "@xcite proposed that the rotation of bars is decelerated by the exchange of energy and angular momentum with dark - matter particles on orbits in resonance with the bar s rotation . while further work by @xcite confirmed this conclusion , the size required for a stellar bar to significantly change the mass distribution in the inner regions of a dark - matter halo",
    "was found to be much larger than those observed in barred galaxies .",
    "hence , this mechanism is thought to be of limited importance for the majority of dark - matter haloes , though the deceleration process is certainly affecting the evolution of galactic bars .",
    "however , galaxy formation also involves violent processes , where baryonic inflow is neither smooth nor adiabatic .",
    "gas accretion is likely to occur during galaxy mergers , when it takes the form of clumpy infall rather than the slow contraction of a smooth cloud .",
    "although a baryon clump falling into the centre of a dark halo will add to the gravitational potential there ( and thus increase the binding energy of the dark halo ) , it can , during this process , lose its orbital energy via dynamical friction .",
    "@xcite showed that the energy thus gained ( i.e.  binding energy lost ) by the dark matter can produce an observable impact on the dark matter density profile .",
    "@xcite and @xcite extended this work by performing @xmath0-body simulations of galaxy clusters , where the infalling galaxies play the role of clumps .",
    "they found that the initial dark - matter cusp can be softened through the transfer of energy from the baryonic clumps to the dark - matter though the overall density profile , including the baryonic component , remained cusped .",
    "attempts have also been made to add full baryonic physics to the studies of sinking clumps mainly based on the results of cosmological simulations , which try to model the effect of cooling , metal enrichment and supernova feedback ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations confirmed the transfer of energy and angular momentum from baryons to the dark - matter , while the results on the dark - matter density reduction were conflicting .",
    "this is presumably because of varying amounts , depending on the details of the respective model , of contraction owed to the additional gravitational pull from the accreted baryons .    despite these promising attempts , a truly realistic modelling of baryonic",
    "physics is still beyond contemporary simulation techniques , not least because important baryonic processes , such as re - ionisation as well as primordial and ordinary star - formation , are themselves not sufficiently understood .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand more quantitatively the purely stellar dynamical aspect of this mechanism , which alone affects the dark - matter distribution .",
    "some progress towards this goal has been made recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , a complete understanding of the pure stellar dynamical problem is still missing , but seems essential before attempting to interpret the results of simulations which include baryons . in the present paper , we build on this previous work to explore the impact of clumpy baryonic infall more broadly .",
    "we consider more realistic initial conditions .",
    "in particular , we focus on clumps initially on parabolic orbits , which may become bound to a halo during a merger event , and haloes with anisotropic velocity distributions , the expected situation to obtain within the hierarchical structure formation scenario of cdm .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : analytic ]",
    "we consider analytical estimates for the damage done to the halo by the energy transfer from the satellite orbit .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] gives our modelling approach for the @xmath0-body simulations , while sections  [ sec : decay ] and [ sec : halo : change ] describe the resulting orbital decay and typical changes induced in the simulated haloes .",
    "sections  [ sec : vary : beta ] and [ sec : beta : r ] discuss the effect of halo velocity anisotropy on both orbital decay and damage to the halo , while section  [ sec : vary : ms : rs ] considers the effect of satellite mass and size . in section  [ sec : removal ]",
    "we demonstrate the effect of removing the accreted clump , corresponding to a galactic wind subsequent .",
    "finally , sections  [ sec : summary ] and [ sec : discuss ] summarise and discuss our findings , respectively .",

    "chandrasekhar s formula also suggests that the drag force is strongest for small @xmath14 ( because this increases the interaction time between perturber and dark - matter particles ) and/or for large @xmath10 .",
    "however , the formula can not be used to assess the effect the infalling clump has on the dark matter .",
    "a simple estimate for the mass removed from the inner parts of the dark - matter halo can be obtained from the following argument originally due to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* preprint version ) .",
    "assuming a circular orbit for the perturber , the specific energy lost when sinking from radius @xmath15 to @xmath16 is @xmath17 \\delta r =    2\\pi\\,g\\,r\\left(\\frac{\\bar{\\rho}}{3 } + \\rho\\right ) \\delta r\\ ] ] with @xmath18 the mean density interior to radius @xmath16 . assuming this energy is injected into the spherical shell at radius @xmath16 , each dark - matter particle at that radius gains specific energy @xmath19 . a density core forms and the sinking of the clump stalls @xcite as soon as this energy equals the specific kinetic energy of each particle , which may be estimated as @xmath20 . with ( [ eq : deltaa ] ) , this yields ( with @xmath21 ) @xmath22    \\,{m_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\simeq \\frac{4-\\gamma}{3-\\gamma}\\,{m_{\\mathrm{s}}}.\\ ] ] this argument suggests ( i ) that the mass ejected by the perturber is comparable to its own mass , and ( ii ) that the density core which forms in response to the heating induced by the sinking baryonic clump has radius comparable to that at which the originally enclosed mass equals @xmath8 .",
    "strictly speaking , this argument only applies to circular orbits , which are not very realistic , and the assessment of the heating required to turn a cusp into a core is rather crude .",
    "we now present a more quantitative estimate based on the exact energy difference between initial and final halo and on the assumption that the orbital energy lost by the clump is absorbed by ( the inner parts of ) the halo .    assuming spherical symmetry ,",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the cumulative mass profiles of the initial and final halo . at large radii",
    "the halo is hardly altered , i.e.  @xmath25 , while at small radii the halo has been heated resulting in an expansion and hence @xmath26 .",
    "a quantitative relation between the change in @xmath27 and the mass @xmath8 of the clump can be obtained by considering the total energy budget . by virtue of the virial theorem ,",
    "the total energy of the initial equilibrium halo is half its potential energy @xmath28 , to which the kinetic energy of the clump and the interaction energy between clump and halo must be added to obtain the total energy of the initial state ( neglecting the clump self - energy ) @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the initial radius and speed of the clump and @xmath32 the potential due to the initial halo .",
    "expressing this in terms of the initial specific orbital energy @xmath33 of the clump and the cumulative mass profile gives @xmath34 - \\frac{g}{4 } \\int_0^\\infty    \\frac{m^2_{\\mathrm{i}}(r)}{r^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}r,\\ ] ] where we have used the relation @xmath35 .",
    "for the final state ( halo in equilibrium with the clump at rest in the centre ) we have @xmath36  this is obtained as @xmath37 using @xmath38 ( assuming a point - mass clump ) and ignoring the clump self - energy .",
    "if the clump is extended with cumulative mass profile @xmath39 , then @xmath40 in equation  ( [ eq : e : f ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath41 equating @xmath42 and re - arranging gives @xmath43 this equation relates the clump mass and its initial conditions with the change in the halo mass profile .",
    "because this latter is a one - dimensional function , while relation ( [ eq : energy : balance ] ) provides only a single constraint , it can be satisfied by many possible functional forms for the final mass profile @xmath24 . however , using some simple yet reasonable models for the final mass profile @xmath24 we can obtain some quantitative estimates for the amount of mass excavated @xmath44 in particular its maximum and the radius at which it occurs , and their dependence on clump mass and initial specific energy @xmath45 .    in order to compare directly to our simulations , we chose the same initial halo density profile , given in equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) below , as used in the simulations .",
    "for the final halo we assume two different families of models ; the first have mass profile @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the central density slope of the initial halo .",
    "these models have a @xmath48 density cusp at small radii .",
    "the second family of models also have the central density slope @xmath49 and scale radius @xmath50 as free parameter and are given by @xmath51^{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{i}}-\\gamma_0 } )    \\big).\\ ] ]    the top panels of fig .",

    ", both models suggest that a clump of @xmath55 of the halo mass can excavate about @xmath56 times its own mass for @xmath53 and twice its own mass for @xmath54 .",
    "the models of equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) also indicate that a less massive clump is relatively more efficient in that it removes a larger multiple of its own mass .",
    "the radius @xmath57 at which @xmath58 becomes maximal ( and hence @xmath59 ) is shown in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] , again as function of clump mass @xmath8 . for a clump of only 1% of the halo mass",
    ", this radius can easily reach the dark - matter scale radius .",
    "we also plot in the bottom panels the radius @xmath60 inside of which half the mass has been removed , i.e.  @xmath61 , which is readily measured from our @xmath0-body simulations below and provides a more direct measure of the size of any possible density core . the rankings between the models of equation ( [ eq : b ] ) ( _ solid _ curves in fig .",

    "@xmath57 and @xmath60 are opposite to each other : the model with the smallest @xmath60 has the largest @xmath57 and @xmath49 and vice versa .",
    "while both @xmath60 and @xmath57 clearly increase with @xmath8 , as one would expect , this dependence is rather weak , approximately @xmath62 for the models of equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) near @xmath63 .",
    "note that in obtaining these estimates we have assumed that the final halo is spherical and in perfect equilibrium . in reality",
    ", the momentum of the infalling clump is absorbed by the inner halo , which as a consequence moves slightly w.r.t .",
    "its outer parts .",
    "this motion is only weakly damped and it takes some time before its energy is transformed into internal heat .",
    "this implies that the estimates for @xmath64 from equation  ( [ eq : energy : balance ] ) ( as used in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] ) are possibly somewhat too high , depending on the amount of energy absorbed into such oscillations .",
    "the inner asphericity resulting from the absorbed momentum also implies that the simple model spherical over - estimates @xmath64 ( because it under - estimates @xmath65 given @xmath66 ) .",
    "the above energy argument is only suggestive and can not predict the final mass profiles and its dependence on the details of the satellite orbit and the initial halo equilibrium . to this end numerical ( @xmath0-body ) simulations",
    "are required .",
    "recently , @xcite performed such simulations for a satellite starting on a circular orbit at the half - mass radius of a spherical dark - matter halo model with a @xcite density profile and isotropic velocities .",
    "they found that the orbital decay of a satellite with 1% of the halo mass heats the dark matter and results in a density core of radius @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the initial scale radius of the halo , the radius at which @xmath69 .",
    "a study by @xcite also considered satellites on circular orbits , but for a variety of halo density profiles with different inner density slope @xmath70 .",
    "these authors were especially interested in the stalling of the orbital decay @xcite , which depends sensitively on @xmath70 .    assuming a circular orbit for the satellite may simplify some analytical arguments , but is certainly not very realistic .",
    "similarly , the assumption of velocity isotropy for the dark matter is not justified and made only for convenience ( so that initial conditions are easily prepared ) , though simulations by @xcite indicate that velocity anisotropy plays no significant role .",
    "the aim of the present study is to extend the aforementioned simulations to more realistic initial conditions . in particular , we are interested in non - circular satellite orbits and cosmologically motivated velocity anisotropy for the dark matter .",
    "our energy - based argument of  [ sec : analytic ] shows that the total amount of heating induced by the decaying satellite orbit only depends on the satellite orbit s energy , but not on its eccentricity .",
    "however , where the satellite dumps its energy , and consequently which halo particles gain energy and angular momentum , will depend on eccentricity . in order to differentiate these effects , we will present two sets of @xmath0-body simulations with satellite orbits of the same energy .",
    "the first set essentially extends the simulations of @xcite by considering satellite orbits of varying eccentricity , but same initial radius and energy as used by those authors .",
    "the second set of simulations considers parabolic orbits , whose initial orbital energy just vanishes .",
    "if it were not for dynamical friction , these orbits would just pass by the dark - matter halo and never return .",
    "however , due to dynamical friction they become bound and decay to the halo centre if initially aimed sufficiently close .",
    "we consider isotropic velocities for the dark matter as well as velocity anisotropy of various degree and radial dependence .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the effects from changing the satellite mass and/or its adopted size .      for the density profile of the dark - matter halo , we adopt a truncated spherical @xcite model , which gives an excellent fit to simulated cdm halos and has density @xmath71 for @xmath72 , this profile asymptotes to @xmath73 and @xmath74 at small and large radii , respectively , with a very smooth transition .",
    "we identify the scale radius with the radius at which @xmath75 ( in the limit @xmath72 ) , which for these models is given by @xmath76 and set the truncation radius to @xmath77 , which we identify with the virial radius .",
    "we consider various velocity anisotropy profiles ; in particular models for which @xmath78 is constant and models for which @xmath79 these latter models are isotropic in the centre and become increasingly radially anisotropic ( for @xmath80 ) at large radii , again with a very smooth transition , and are excellent descriptions of @xmath0-body cdm haloes @xcite .",
    "to generate initial @xmath0-body conditions for the halo , we sample positions from ( [ eq : rho ] ) and velocities from self - consistent distribution functions of the form @xmath81 for constant @xmath82 models with @xmath83 obtained from an abel inversion @xcite . for models with @xmath84 as in equation ( [ eq : beta : r ] ) , we generate initial conditions using the made - to - measure @xmath0-body method of @xcite .    for models with constant @xmath82 ,",
    "the resolution in the inner parts is enhanced by increasing the sampling probability by a factor @xmath85 which is compensated by setting particle masses @xmath86 proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "we used @xmath88 with @xmath89 the ratio between maximum and minimum particle mass and @xmath90 the radius of the circular orbit with specific energy @xmath91 .",
    "the gravitational forces were computed using a softening kernel with density profile given in equation  ( [ eq : soft : rho ] ) below and @xmath92 replaced by the softening length @xmath93 . testing this method for our particular purposes we found that it allows a reduction of @xmath0 to half at the same central resolution without any adverse effects .",
    "we use a unit system where @xmath94 , which implies a time unit of @xmath95 .",
    "henceforth , we shall use the term ` satellite ' for the infalling baryonic clump , which we model as a single massive extended ( softened ) particle . for the satellite mass @xmath8 we considered 0.3% , 1% , and 3% of the total halo mass ( only 77%",
    "of which is inside @xmath96 associated with the virial radius ) , while the satellite size @xmath97 was taken to be @xmath98 , @xmath99 , or @xmath100 times the halo scale radius .",
    "this means that the satellite is effectively modelled to have spherical density profile @xmath101 we considered a large range of initial satellite orbits , but report here only on two sets of simulations .",
    "the simulations of the first set , summarised in the top half of table  [ tab : results ] , all start from @xmath102 , the radius containing 40% of the total or 54% of the mass within @xmath96 , and have specific orbital energy @xmath103 equal to that of the circular orbit at that radius .",
    "the only remaining free parameter of these orbits is the pericentric radius of the initial orbit  owing to dynamical friction , the actual trajectory of the satellite may have a slightly smaller first pericentric radius .",
    "these simulations thus extend those reported by @xcite to non - zero eccentricity and also anisotropic halo velocity distributions .",
    "the second set of simulations , summarised in the second half of table  [ tab : results ] , employs parabolic orbits , i.e.  with initial orbital energy @xmath104 , started at @xmath105 , corresponding to the halo virial radius . again , the only free orbital parameter is the pericentric radius of the initial orbit .    within either set of simulations",
    "the specific energy of the initial orbit is the same .",
    "this choice was motivated by the analytic argument of section  [ sec : analytic ] , which suggested that orbital energy is the main parameter affecting the amount of ` damage ' done to the halo . thus keeping this energy fixed and varying orbital eccentricity or , equivalently , the pericentric radius",
    ", we can study the influence of this secondary orbital parameter .",

    "the exception is the halo model with initial @xmath84 following equation  ( [ eq : beta : r ] ) with @xmath121 .",
    "this model turned out to be unstable to the radial - orbit instability and spontaneously re - arranges into a triaxial configuration within @xmath122200 time units .",
    "in the course of this process the radial mass distribution is also slightly altered even without infalling satellite . in order to minimize the effects of these problems when interpreting our results",
    ", we compare each simulation with infalling satellite to a control simulation without satellite but identical initial halo .",
    "table [ tab : results ] shows a numerical summary of our results .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : decay ] , we plot the time evolution of the satellite orbital radius and energy ( top and middle panels ) and the halo lagrange radii ( bottom panels ) for both sets of satellite orbits in a dark - matter halo with isotropic velocities . in all these simulations",
    "the satellite mass and size are at their default values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we like to start our discussion by comparing the circular orbit starting at @xmath102 ( _ red _ in the left panels ) , which is similar to that used by @xcite , and a plunging , almost radial , orbit with vanishing orbital energy ( _ blue _ in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) . while both orbits decay to the centre , their evolution is clearly different .",
    "the circular orbit decays first slowly then faster , whereby remaining near - circular .",
    "the rate of decay , as indicated by the energy loss , is continuously increasing as the orbit comes closer to the centre .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with chandrasekhar s formula  ( [ eq : dynfr ] ) , since the halo density is steeply increasing inwards .",
    "the plunging parabolic orbit ( _ blue _ in the right panels ) on the other hand , suffers noticeable energy loss only near peri - centre , undergoing a stepped rather than steady decay of orbital energy . at the first peri - centric passage ,",
    "the satellite loses enough orbital energy to find itself on a bound but highly eccentric orbit which returns to the inner parts of the halo within about 4 halo half - mass dynamical times .",
    "the energy loss at the second pericentric passage is larger , resulting in a quick orbital decay thereafter . the time scale ( note the different the time axes in the left and right panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : decay ] ) for the decay of this orbit is only about twice as long as that of the circular orbit starting much closer ( a circular orbit starting at @xmath96 does not decay within 1000 time units ) .",
    "thus , even though more energy has to be lost for this orbit , the dynamical friction at peri - centre is so strong that the decay is still quite fast , even though the orbit spends about half its time well outside the halo virial radius .    during the first few periods , the peri - centric radius for this plunging orbit is hardly decaying",
    "this is expected if dynamical friction causes a near - instantaneous deceleration at peri - centre , which transfers the satellite to an orbit with the same pericentric radius .",
    "the apparent decay of the peri - centric radius after two periods is not because dynamical friction away from pericentre becomes significant , as the closest approach to the origin ( as opposed to the halo centre ) is in fact increasing , but because the centre of the halo has moved , as a consequence of the satellite interaction .    for all orbits ,",
    "we identify as the orbital decay or infall time @xmath125 the time at which the difference @xmath126 first obtains 2% of its original value .",
    "there is a systematic trend of the infall time to decrease for higher eccentricities ( smaller @xmath127 within each set of simulations ) , which is easily understood by the fact that dynamical friction is stronger for the higher density at smaller radii .",
    "interestingly , after the initial decay , when the orbital energy has almost reached its final value , the satellite and the halo centre are still orbiting each other at a distance of initially @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , the orbital decay was incomplete and has stalled .",
    "unlike the situation investigated by previous authors , this stalling occurs at a radius which contains much less dark mass than the satellite mass @xmath8 and it seems more apt to say the halo centre orbits the satellite .",
    "this small orbit remains inert only for a short while ( when @xmath129 remains constant or even increases at @xmath130 , see also fig .",
    "[ fig:2ndecay ] ) , which is longer for high eccentricities of the initial orbit , while for the initially circular orbit ( @xmath131 ) there is hardly any such stalling . after this brief pause",
    ", the orbit decays very nearly exponentially with radial e - folding time of @xmath132 time units for the bound orbits ( _ left _ panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) , which is discernable for over two e - foldings until the orbital radius reaches the noise level . in case of initially parabolic satellite orbits ( _ right _ ) , the stalled orbits are more eccentric and their decay more erratic ( but qualitatively similar ) with a longer decay time ( e - folding time of @xmath133 ) .",
    "remarkably , the secondary decay times are very similar between orbits within either set of simulation , but differ between them .",
    "this implies that the eccentricity of the initial and also the stalled orbit are not affecting the process responsible for this phenomenon .",
    "the differences in secondary decay times may be caused by differences , induced by the orbital decay , in the structure of the central halo , as discussed below .",
    "this secondary decay is not associated with any significant orbital energy loss and has no measurable effect on the final halo density profile ( except perhaps for the innermost 0.1% of the halo mass ) , which is the main interest of our study . however",
    ", it is certainly an interesting stellar dynamical phenomenon deserving further investigation .",
    "we now discuss the changes induced by the satellite s orbital decay in the dark - matter halo , concentrating mostly on the spatial distribution , while the changes to the velocity structure are mostly discussed in the next section .",
    "the middle panels of fig .  [ fig : decay ] also show the evolution of the central halo potential @xmath134 ( lower curves ; not including the contribution of the satellite ) , which at late time coincides with the satellite s orbital energy . in all simulations ,",
    "the final central potential depth of the halo is considerably shallower than initially , indicating a significant reduction of the central dark - matter concentration .",
    "a comparison between the various simulations also shows that this reduction is more pronounced for parabolic than for bound satellite orbits , exactly as our analytic arguments of section  [ sec : analytic ] predicted , as well as for more eccentric orbits .    in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] , we plot the time evolution of the halo lagrange radii , while fig .  [",
    "fig : profile ] shows for the same simulations the halo density @xmath10 before and after the satellite infall , as well as the change ( [ eq : delta : m ] ) in the cumulative halo mass profile and in the pseudo phase - space density @xmath135 . from the time evolution of the lagrange radii",
    ", we see that the expansion of the inner halo occurs rather suddenly at the time when the satellite settles in the core .",
    "] , in particular for the initially circular orbit ( _ red _ in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) . for more eccentric orbits ,",
    "the early peri - centre passages result in some minor expansion of the halo at radii comparable to the peri - centre radius , but hardly affect the innermost halo .",
    "the mass @xmath58 removed from inside radius @xmath16 ( compared to the control simulation is always measured this way , rather than against the initial model ( as in equation  [ eq : delta : m ] ) , in order to account for halo evolution in absence of any satellite . ] ) has different radial profiles for the various simulations .",
    "its amplitude is generally larger after the decay of a parabolic than a bound orbit , which is due to the larger orbital energy of the former leading to stronger heating of the dark - matter particles .",
    "in fact , the maximum mass excavated @xmath136 is about twice the satellite mass if the latter is decaying on a plunging parabolic orbit , consistent with our models of section  [ sec : analytic ] , while for a circular orbit decaying from @xmath102 , corresponding to the situation studied by @xcite , @xmath137 .",
    "this difference between @xmath64 obtained for orbits with @xmath104 ( parabolic ) @xmath103 ( bound ) is even more pronounced than for the analytical models of fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] .    within each set of orbits",
    "@xmath58 is most peaked for the purely radial orbit , while it widens for lower eccentricities .",
    "this is presumably because a satellite on a highly eccentric loses its energy to a narrow range of dark - matter particles close to its peri - centre , while less eccentric orbits lead to a distribution over a wider range .",
    "the density profiles in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] confirm earlier results that the infall of a baryonic clump can considerably weaken the central dark - matter cusp .",
    "the final halo mass profiles ( not shown ) are noticeably perturbed interior to the radius @xmath57 ( indicated by the vertical lines in the bottom panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : profile ] ) , at which by definition the final halo density equals that of the control simulation without satellite . in order to quantify further the properties of the inner halo density profiles , we also calculate the radius @xmath60 ( indicated by the vertical lines in the middle panels of fig .  [ fig : profile ] ) interior to which the dark mass mass is reduced to 50% compared to the control simulation . in general",
    ", @xmath60 is smaller than @xmath57 and marks the radius at which significant changes to the halo density profile are evident .",
    "there is a clear trend for more eccentric orbits to more strongly reduce the central density and hence result in a larger radial range over which the density has been significantly reduced : @xmath60 is larger for smaller @xmath127 .",
    "the opposite is true for the radius @xmath57 .",
    "this contrasting behaviour of @xmath60 and @xmath57 can be understood in terms of the different shapes of the excavated mass distribution @xmath58 , which becomes broader with increasing @xmath127 , presumably because the energy input is spread over a larger radial range .",
    "such an anti - correlation between @xmath60 and @xmath57 for simulations with the same initial satellite orbital energy @xmath45 was also present in the analytic models in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] . for those analytic models",
    "the effect was generated by assuming different central density slopes @xmath138 .",
    "however , the central density slope of the final @xmath0-body models ( middle panel in fig .  [ fig : profile ] ) are remarkably similar at around @xmath139 at radii @xmath140 .",
    "we should stress , however , that the inner regions of these halo models are gravitationally dominated by the sunken satellite , and hence can not be sensibly compared to the dark - matter haloes of galaxies .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] the radii @xmath141 at which the enclosed dark mass equals that of the satellite ( arrows in the top panels ) . evidently , these radii do not differ much from @xmath60 , implying that the innermost final dark - matter profiles are not self - gravitating : their gravity is dominated by the accreted satellite .",
    "since the satellite size @xmath142 is about ten times smaller than the radius inside of which it dominates the dynamics , it is effectively acting like a central point mass . a tracer population orbiting a point mass has a cusp @xmath143 if its phase - space density is constant .",
    "however , the simulations have much shallower central cusps , suggesting that the actual dark - matter phase - space density has a central depression , decreasing towards the highest binding energies .",

    "[ fig : profile ] : while initially and in the control simulations ( dotted and solid black curves ) these follow a pure power law ( this is how these models are actually constructed , see * ? ? ?",

    "the corresponding reduction in spatial density is much weaker , because the available phase space is increased above that from the self - gravitating cusp by the deeper central potential due to the accreted satellite .",

    "the final halo has @xmath147 increasing towards smaller radii ( not shown , but evident from the strong central depression in @xmath135 compared to that in @xmath10 ) , inside the radius @xmath141 , as is required for any equilibrium system dominated by a central mass concentration .      in all our simulations ,",
    "the dark matter halo is initially spherical .",
    "the top panels of fig .  [ fig : shape ] show the run of the final halo s principal axis ratios for the same simulations as in figs .",
    "[ fig : decay ] and [ fig : profile ] . at @xmath148",
    "the final dark matter distribution is near - oblate in all cases , becoming flatter towards the centre reaching @xmath149 at the smallest measurable radius .",
    "the bottom panels of the same figure show the direction cosines of the minor axis .",
    "note that the satellite initially orbits in the @xmath150 plane , starting at @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "for all but the purely radial orbits the halo minor axis is perpendicular to the initial orbital plane of the satellite .",
    "this is easily understood to originate from the transfer of orbital angular momentum from the satellite to inner halo particles during peri - centric passages , which presumably also generates the oblate inner halo shape .    for the purely radial satellite orbits ( cyan ) , which start off with zero orbital angular momentum",
    ", the final halo minor axis does not align with the satellite orbit , but appears to point in some random direction ( though it is self - aligned ) .",

    "the infall axis .",
    "however , such a break of symmetry is the natural behaviour of radial orbits in the gravitational potentials of a density cusp .",
    "this is best explained by considering the limit of vanishing peri - centre radius for the change in azimuth @xmath153 occurring over one radial period from apo - centre to apo - centre .",
    "for a harmonic potential , corresponding to @xmath154 , the radial orbit just passes straight through ( @xmath155 ) , while in the potential generated by a point mass , corresponding to @xmath156 , the radial orbit is reflected ( @xmath157 ) . for mass distributions with intermediate values of @xmath70 , such as dark - matter haloes",

    ", the halo potential is modelled from the softened particle potentials and deviates from the power - law form at @xmath162 , where it becomes harmonic and the discontinuity at @xmath161 is removed such that @xmath163 for @xmath164 . however , even the simulations with initially purely radial satellite orbits have actual @xmath165 at first passage ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) , such that the simulated satellite orbit is actually deflected . ] .",
    "this deflection of the satellite orbit is compensated by an equal and opposite momentum to the inner halo , such that the subsequent relative orbit of the two is no longer radial .",
    "the further evolution follows the same pattern as for the non - radial orbits : the halo flattens perpendicular to the angular momentum axis of this orbit . note that for both radial orbit simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] the minor axis is near - perpendicular to the original infall direction ( @xmath166-axis ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that @xmath153 for a shallow cusp is only slightly larger than the value @xmath167 for the harmonic potential , implying that the orbit is only weakly deflected from its original infall trajectory , which is indeed what we see in our simulations .",
    "there is also some hint of triaxiality at small radii , in particular for the radial bound orbit .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as it mostly occurs within the region where the satellite dominates the enclosed mass and hence the potential is near - spherical .",
    "we suspect that this very central triaxiality is generated during the secondary orbital decay if the small decaying orbit is eccentric .",
    "so far , we have discussed the results from eight simulations , which differed only in the satellite orbit , but had the same initial halo model with velocity isotropy .",
    "we are now investigating initially anisotropic dark - matter velocity distributions .",
    "since parabolic orbits are more realistic for infalling clumps , we restrict our discussion to the four satellite orbits with initially vanishing orbital energy @xmath104 and various eccentricities . most of our general conclusion are , however , at least qualitatively also valid for bound orbits .",
    "in addition to the halo model with velocity isotropy , used in sections  [ sec : decay ] and [ sec : halo : change ] , we consider three initially anisotropic models .",
    "two of these have constant anisotropy parameter of @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively , which corresponds to the same level of anisotropy in the sense of @xmath170 ( with the tangential velocity dispersion @xmath171/2 $ ] ) .",
    "the third anisotropic halo model is motivated by simulations of galaxy halo formation , which generally predict that the velocity distribution of the dark matter within haloes is outwardly increasing radially anisotropic @xcite .",
    "we use the anisotropy profile of equation ( [ eq : beta : r ] ) with @xmath121 .",
    "this halo model is quite different from the others , as it undergoes a radial orbit instability , and we discuss it in some more detail in section  [ sec : beta : r ] .      before we discuss the simulations , let us consider an important difference between these four models .",
    "haloes with more radially biased velocities have more mass on eccentric orbits , which spend most of their time near apo - centre , but contribute significantly to the density near their respective peri - centres , in particular if the density increases more slowly than @xmath172 ( because of geometrical effects ) as it does in the inner regions of dark - matter haloes .",
    "consequently , much of the dark matter in the innermost region of a halo with radial velocity anisotropy is on orbits which spend most of their time outside the innermost halo and have lower binding energies than the local circular orbits .",
    "thus the more radially biased the velocities , the less mass is at high binding energies , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmde ] , which shows the differential energy distributions @xmath173 for our four halo models ( computed from @xmath0-body data ; for a cleaner plot of the same effect but for different models see fig .  4.5 of @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative lack of highly bound orbits in haloes with radial velocity anisotropy has immediate consequences for the responsiveness and hence vulnerability of the central regions to perturbations , such as an infalling massive satellite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "highly bound orbits are confined to the central regions , which makes them relatively inert to external perturbations , in particular if their orbital period is short compared to the time scale of the perturbation ( adiabatic invariance ) .",
    "the eccentric orbits in haloes with radial velocity anisotropy , on the other hand , have longer periods and hence are not adiabatically protected in the same way .",
    "moreover , the infalling satellite can relatively easily perturb dark - matter particles near the apo - centres of such orbits , increasing their angular momenta and hence peri - centric radius , and thereby reducing the central density of the halo .",
    "these arguments also suggest that the difference in vulnerability between haloes with isotropic and radially anisotropic velocities is more pronounced for perturbation by a satellite passing at larger peri - centric radius , which affects eccentric orbits contributing to the centre , but hardly the innermost orbits .",
    "a satellite falling in on a purely radial orbit , on the other hand , will affect dark - matter orbits at all radii , regardless of halo anisotropy .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] , we plot the radial @xmath82 profiles of the final halo in simulations of the decay of the four different parabolic satellite orbits ( colour coded as in figs .",
    "[ fig : decay ] to [ fig : shape ] ) in each of the three different halo models with constant initial @xmath82 .    in case of initial velocity isotropy",
    "the final velocity distribution is isotropic too , while in all of the initially anisotropic cases , the halo velocity distribution evolves towards isotropy in the inner regions .",
    "this evolution is partly driven by ( artificial ) two - body relaxation , as evident from the control simulations ( green in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] ) , which results in velocity isotropy at @xmath174 .",
    "however , for the simulations with decaying satellite orbit , this isotropisation occurs to larger radii , which is essentially independent of the orbital eccentricity of the decaying orbit , and is only a function of the initial halo anisotropy .",
    "this radius is larger by about a factor 3 for the models with initially constant tangential velocity anisotropy than for the models with initially constant radial velocity anisotropy .",
    "this is somewhat surprising in view of the discussion in the previous subsection .",
    "one speculation is that a system with tangential velocity anisotropy is not well - mixed in the sense of @xcite and @xcite , such that violent relaxation , induced by the perturbation , promotes evolution towards isotropy , while perhaps the opposite is true for radial velocity anisotropy .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the evolution of the anisotropy profile is complete by the time of the first qualitative change in the orbit ( i.e.  essentially at @xmath175 ) .",
    "thereafter , the final secondary decay of the satellite orbit takes place without further modification of the halo velocity distribution .      instead of showing detailed figures ,",

    "as already mentioned in section  [ sec : model : tech ] , our spherical halo model with such an anisotropy profile undergoes a radial - orbit instability and quickly settles into a prolate configuration . while this instability somewhat complicates the interpretation of any results , the corresponding simulations are presumably most realistic what concerns the halo structure .      for the four simulations of initially parabolic satellite orbits in this halo model ,",

    "[ fig : decay : beta ] the orbital decay and time evolution of the halo lagrange radii , similar to the right panels of fig .",

    "first note that the control simulation ( black ) undergoes an initial expansion within the first @xmath122200 time units .",
    "this expansion is largely driven by the violent relaxation during the re - arrangement to a prolate configuration ( due to the radial - orbit instability ) , while the expansion seen in the other control simulations ( see fig .  [",

    "the orbital decay is faster than for any other halo model considered ( see top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : vary : beta ] ) , because of the more efficient transfer of satellite orbital energy and angular momentum to the halo particles ( as outlined in section  [ sec : beta : vulnerable ] ) during the very first peri - centric passages , when the halo density is not yet diminished by the instability - driven expansion .",
    "the associated heating of the innermost halo results in a slightly faster expansion in the simulations with satellite than in the control simulation even at @xmath182 .",
    "the same is true to a lesser degree for the halo with @xmath181 ( not shown ) , while for the halo with isotropic velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) , the lagrange radii at @xmath182 were hardly affected by the early peri - centric passages .",
    "this different response of the innermost halo to the satellite s first peri - centric passage can be attributed to the predominance of eccentric dark - matter orbits in the innermost halo , which are perturbed by the passing satellite at their respective apo - centres , as outlined in section  [ sec : beta : vulnerable ] .",

    "[ fig : profile ] and [ fig : shape ] ) for the four simulations with decaying satellite orbits ( coloured ) , the initial model ( dotted ) , and control simulation ( black ) .",
    "all these radial profiles after satellite orbit decay are quite similar , the strongest difference is 15% between the amplitudes of @xmath58 .",
    "this similarity is also expected from our discussion in section  [ sec : beta : vulnerable ] : the halo is so responsive that the exact satellite orbit does not matter too much .",
    "the pseudo phase - space density , @xmath135 ( top panel ) , of the control simulation is even larger than initially , although the density is reduced at @xmath186 .",
    "the reason for this counter - intuitive behaviour is that the isotropisation ( evident from the runs of @xmath82 ) has reduced the velocity dispersion @xmath5 in the inner parts .",
    "however , after the orbital decay of the satellite , @xmath135 is substantially reduced and necessarily also the true phase - space density . the maximum pseudo phase - space density is a factor 2 - 3 smaller than for simulations with initial velocity isotropy , and the density a factor @xmath187 .",
    "this represents the strongest central halo reduction in all models ( for the default values of satellite mass and size ) , which makes sense in view of the vulnerability due to the radial velocity anisotropy .",
    "the mass @xmath183 excavated compared to the control simulation is slightly less for the purely radial orbit ( but slightly more for the orbit with @xmath188 ) than in case of an isotropic halo ( fig.[fig : profile ] ) .",

    "in fact , the @xmath82 profiles are identical to that of the control simulation , presumably because this profile corresponds to a well - mixed state , attained after the initial violent relaxation phase , and hardly affected by any further relaxation due to satellite interaction .",
    "such radially anisotropic velocity distributions are likely the inevitable property of triaxial and prolate equilibria , because of the predominance of low - angular - momentum orbits , such as box orbits @xcite .      obviously , the final halo shapes are completely different from those obtained in simulations with any other initial halo model . as a result of the radial - orbit instability ,",
    "the control simulation obtains a strongly flattened purely prolate shape with axis ratio @xmath190 at @xmath191 ( and some random orientation ) .",
    "this is in remarkable agreement with the fact that dark - matter haloes in gravity - only simulations of large - scale structure formation tend to have near - prolate shapes @xcite .",
    "after the satellite infall , however , the halo shape becomes less flattened and triaxial in the inner parts .",
    "the changes in halo shape compared to the control simulation extend to about @xmath192 , much farther than the changes in halo density or velocity anisotropy .    as the direction",
    "cosines indicate , the orientation of the principle axes of the triaxial shape is constant with radius , as one expects for an equilibrium system .",
    "the minor axis is always perpendicular to the original satellite orbit , while the major axis is somewhere in the initial orbital plane ( except for the purely radial orbit for which such a plane can not be defined ) .",
    "all simulations presented sofar have the same satellite mass @xmath123 and size @xmath124 .",
    "we are now investigating effects of larger and smaller values for these parameters .      fig .",
    "[ fig : msat ] shows the effect of varying @xmath8 by a factor of 3 up and down for a satellite initially on a circular orbit in a halo with isotropic velocities ( _ red _ ) and for a satellite on a parabolic with @xmath193 in a halo with cosmologically motivated @xmath84 .",
    "as expected , more massive satellites reach the centre more rapidly , and cause more damage to the inner halo . in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] , @xmath57 , @xmath60 , and @xmath136 are largest for the most massive satellite , and decrease systematically as the satellite mass is decreased . as the figure shows , the scaling of @xmath57 and @xmath60 with satellite mass is close to scaling @xmath62 ( solid lines ) also found for our analytic models in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] .",
    "the most interesting result from this study of varying satellite mass is that low mass satellites are more efficient at displacing mass than high mass satellites : in agreement with the analytic models the _ relative _ excavated mass @xmath52 increases towards smaller satellite masses .    according to chandrasekhar s dynamical friction formula ( [ eq : dynfr ] ) , the drag on the satellite is proportional to its mass @xmath8 and would therefore naively expect the infall time to scale inversely with satellite mass : @xmath194",
    "this is in fact the scaling indicated by the solid lines in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : msat ] .",
    "however , the actual infall time measured for our simulations differ from this expectation . for the simple situation of an initially circular satellite orbit in a stable halo with isotropic velocities ( red triangles ) ,",
    "the infall time scales more like @xmath195 .",
    "this difference is most likely caused by the re - adjustment of the halo during the satellite infall , an effect we ignored when deducing @xmath194 , which therefore only applies in the limit @xmath196 .",
    "the fact that this limit is not applicable even for @xmath197 may seem surprising , but is not in view of the fact that only a small fraction of the total halo mass accounts for most of its binding energy , which in turn enables such a feeble satellite to inflict significant damage to the halo .",
    "the orbital decay into the halo model with radially increasing @xmath84 ( blue squares ) is complicated by the fact that the halo simultaneously undergoes a radial - orbit instability .",
    "the slight central density reduction driven by this instability increases the infall time compared to the original halo within the first @xmath122200 time units . in our simulations , this sets up a race between satellite infall and instability - driven halo evolution . a more massive satellite sinks more quickly than this evolution and @xmath177 of the original halo applies , while for a low - mass satellite the longer infall time after the instability - driven halo evolution applies .",
    "clearly , this race scenario is an artifact or our simulation setup , and we expect , based on the arguments given above , that in general @xmath177 scales slightly shallower than @xmath198 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsat ] we vary the size @xmath97 of the satellite by a factor 3 up and down , while holding its mass fixed for a circular satellite orbit in an isotropic halo ( red triangles ) and a parabolic satellite orbit with @xmath193 in a halo with cosmologically motivated @xmath84 .",
    "there is a systematic trend that more compact satellites lose energy more quickly and hence exhibit more rapid orbital decay .",
    "this is reasonable as more compact satellites are more efficient at scattering background particles and thus lose energy to the halo more rapidly .    the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rsat ] show that the cumulative effect of the satellite on the halo is almost independent of its size  the values of @xmath52 , @xmath199 , and @xmath180 are virtually unchanged as the size of the satellite is changed by an order of magnitude , in particular for the parabolic orbit in the @xmath84 halo .",
    "this is not very surprising in view of the analytical models of section  [ sec : analytic ] : the orbital energy of the satellite is essentially independent of @xmath97 ( as long as @xmath200 ) .    however , for the circular satellite orbit decaying in a @xmath201 halo",
    ", there is a systematic trend of larger @xmath60 with larger @xmath97 and the halo profile is more significantly flattened by a more extended satellite .",
    "this is also seen in the evolution of the lagrange radii and is reasonable since the more extended the satellite , the less energy it loses at large radii and therefore has more energy to impart to the innermost halo .",
    "more extended satellites on near - circular orbits carry more energy to the inner regions and hence perturb the halo profile to a greater degree ( for highly eccentric orbits this picture does not apply , as they affect the innermost halo already at their first peri - centric passage ) .",
    "the evolution produced by satellites on bound orbits in isotropic haloes is qualitatively the same as that for parabolic orbits , although the magnitude of the effects is reduced . in particular , the infall time differs by only 30% between the largest and smallest satellites , compared to the factor of three for the parabolic satellite orbit in the halo with increasing @xmath84 .",
    "this again may be caused by the increased vulnerability and responsiveness of haloes with radial velocity anisotropy , as discussed in section  [ sec : beta : vulnerable ] .",
    "in our modelling so far we have ignored the additional halo expansion following the possible loss of baryons in a feedback - driven galactic wind . at the final time in the models ,",
    "the gravitational potential inside @xmath202 is dominated by the satellite .",
    "therefore the central potential is still quite deep , even though for most of our models the satellite mass is somewhat smaller than the removed dark mass .",
    "this implies that the bound phase - space volume available for the dark matter at the centre is almost unchanged .    in order to study the effect of baryon outflow on the dark - matter",
    ", we extend one of our models by removing the satellite .",
    "the model concerned is the one with an initially parabolic satellite orbit with @xmath203 falling into a halo with isotropic velocities ( _ blue _ curves in the right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : decay ] and [ fig : profile ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : removal ] , the resulting radial profiles for @xmath135 , @xmath10 , and @xmath183 are shown for the situation ( i ) after satellite accretion ( same as the curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : profile ] ; _ blue _ ) , ( ii ) further 1000 time units after instant satellite removal ( corresponding to a fast wind ; _ magenta _ ) , and ( iii ) after a slow satellite removal ( over 250 times units followed by another 250 time units without satellite ; _ red _ ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the satellite removal has a dramatic effect on the central halo density : the total mass excavated has almost doubled compared to the situation prior to satellite removal and the density has become clearly cored with a central density @xmath204 times smaller than the initial density at the radius where initially @xmath205 .",
    "the most intriguing plot , however , is that of the pseudo phase - space density @xmath135 ( _ top _ panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : removal ] ) . while the re - distribution of material to larger radii has shifted the inner profile somewhat , the overall distribution and the maximum value for @xmath135 remained unaffected by the satellite removal .",
    "for the slow - wind model this is , of course , expected , since the ( true coarse - grained ) phase - space density is conserved . therefore , the additional reduction of @xmath10 and @xmath183 in this case is entirely owed to the reduction in available phase - space effected by the removal of the satellite potential .",
    "of course , this is a non - linear process because the reduction in central dark - matter density itself leads to a further decrease in the potential depth .",
    "this explains why the additional mass removed by the satellite departure ( the difference between the _ red_/_magenta _ and _ blue _ curves ) is quite substantial , exceeding the satellite mass .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , the fast - wind model is only slightly more efficient at removing dark - matter .",
    "this strongly suggests that even a fast galactic wind is nearly adiabatic , i.e.  has little effect on the ( true coarse - grained ) phase - space density ( which is unaffected by a slow wind ) .",
    "we have modelled , using @xmath0-body simulations , the decay of satellite orbits in spherical dark - matter halo models with various degrees of velocity anisotropy .",
    "the evolution of the satellite orbits has several phases .",
    "first there is a steady decline in the amplitude of the orbit with almost constant peri - centric radius , driven by dynamical friction near peri - centre .",
    "this is followed by a period of rapid shrinkage of the peri - centre coinciding with significant expansion of the innermost halo , as evident from the evolution of the lagrange radii in figs .",
    "[ fig : decay ] and [ fig : decay : beta ] .    at this stage",
    "the evolution of the halo , driven by the transfer of energy and angular momentum from the decaying satellite orbit , is more or less complete . the time required for this process scales as @xmath195 with satellite mass , somewhat shallower than the inverse scaling expected from chandrasekhar s dynamical - friction formula .",
    "we also find that @xmath177 is significantly shorter for decay in haloes with radial velocity anisotropy , because the orbital structure of such haloes makes them more susceptible to perturbations .",
    "the orbital evolution shows some interesting and unexpected behaviour after @xmath177 .",
    "the most bound region of the halo and the satellite form a sort of binary , dominated in mass by the satellite , which is modelled as a single softened particle with size ( softening length ) @xmath142 ( our unit of length is the halo scale radius ) .",
    "initially , this secondary orbit has amplitude @xmath206 , but after a brief period of apparent growth decays very nearly exponentially with e - folding time of 90 time units .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:2ndecay ] , which plots for all 12 simulations of bound satellite orbits the late time evolution of the distance @xmath207 between halo centre and satellite after the initial infall of the satellite . in all these cases",
    "the secondary orbital decay occurs",
    ". the secondary orbit may be eccentric ( as for @xmath208 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2ndecay ] ) or near - circular , when the decay appears more regular . in the case of parabolic satellite orbits",
    "( not shown ) , the secondary decay does not always occur or is much more noisy and less regular .",
    "we are not sure about the cause and dynamics of this phenomenon , and whether it is a numerical artifact or not .",
    "it may be related to the form of the softened satellite potential , though the secondary orbital amplitude decays from @xmath209 to @xmath210 , such that the harmonic inner parts of the softened potential become relevant only in the late stages .",
    "even though the assumed satellite mass was only 1% of the total halo mass , the damage done to the halo is significant : the inner parts of the halo are substantially reduced in density and phase - space density ( as indicated by the behaviour of @xmath135 ) , when the satellite has displaced up to twice its own mass from the innermost halo .",
    "the satellite also affects the velocity structure of the inner halo making it more isotropic .",
    "finally , the halo shape becomes triaxial in its inner parts .",
    "we find that the efficiency with which the satellite can affect the halo , e.g.  the amount of central density reduction , is increased for haloes with radial velocity anisotropy .",
    "this is understandable in terms of the orbital structure of such haloes , making them more vulnerable ( see section  [ sec : beta : vulnerable ] ) , and relevant , as real dark - matter haloes are expected , from simulations of large - scale structure formation , to be radial anisotropic .",
    "one of our most interesting findings is that satellites of smaller mass are relatively more efficient in damaging the halo : the ratio @xmath211 of the maximum displaced halo mass over the satellite mass increases towards smaller satellite masses @xmath8 ( though the orbital decay time decreases , of course ) , as in fact predicted by the analytic energy arguments presented in section  [ sec : analytic ] .",
    "in this study we have ignored the details of baryonic physics and instead used the simple model of a compact baryonic clump falling into a dark - matter halo . of all possible scenarios for the effect of baryonic physics on the structure of",
    "dark - matter haloes this is likely the most efficient .",
    "this process proved to be highly effective in altering the structure of the dark - matter halo in its inner parts , where the galaxy resides .",
    "a single clump of only 1% of the total halo mass can reduce the density at @xmath212 halo scale radii by more than an order of magnitude ( including the effect of a galactic wind as demonstrated in section  [ sec : removal ] ) , more than sufficient to explain the discrepancies between the rotation curves predicted ( using gravity - only simulations ) and observed for dark - matter dominated galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total amount of baryons is one sixth of all matter @xcite , i.e.  0.2 times the dark mass , 20 times more than our model clump .",
    "thus , if the baryonic heating of a dark - matter halo is only @xmath213 efficient on average , the damage done to the halo is equivalent to that in our models , because any additional addiabatic inflow _ and _ outflow of baryons has no lasting effect on the dark matter .",
    "this assumes , of course , that the baryonic sub - structures and clumps are able to heat the dark - matter particles which contribute to the central cusp .",
    "our simple model of a compact clump , which sinks to the centre of the dark - matter halo , is certainly somewhat unrealistic as baryonic structures are susceptible to disruption by tidal forces before they reach the innermost parts of the halo .",
    "however , owing to their dissipative nature baryons , unlike dark - matter , can form new sub - structures and clumps , which then continue to heat the dark - matter via dynamical friction . moreover , as our simulations have shown , radial velocity anisotropy , which is typical for dark - matter haloes , make their innermost parts more vulnerable to perturbations from the outside .",
    "this is because much of the matter in the cuspy region is on eccentric orbits spending most of their time at much larger radii where they are prone to dynamic heating ( see also section  [ sec : beta : vulnerable ] ) .",
    "a key process in the re - shaping of dark - matter haloes by non - gravitational baryonic physics is the transfer of energy via dynamical friction from baryonic sub - structures to the dark - matter particles .",
    "the effect of this heating can be understood qualitatively by considering the jeans equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath214 the heating of the dark matter by the non - adiabatic baryon infall raises the central @xmath215 , which , at fixed @xmath10 , increases the pressure gradient ( left - hand side ) . at the same time",
    ", the arrival of the baryons increases the gravitational pull ( right - hand side ) . if these two effects balance exactly , the dark - matter density @xmath10 remains unaffected .",
    "if the heating dominates , as was the case in our maximally non - adiabatic simulations , then @xmath10 must flatten to retain equilibrium .",
    "conversely , if the gravitational pull dominates ( especially for negligible heating , i.e.  ` adiabatic contraction ' ) , then @xmath10 has to steepen ( and @xmath215 will increase adiabatically due to the compression ) .",
    "the exact balance depends on the details and most likely varies systematically with galaxy type , size , and environment , explaining the possibility of conflicting results from simulations which attempt to model baryon physics more directly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative way to look at this problem is to consider the effect on the dark - matter ( coarse - grained ) phase - space density , which arguably is dynamically more relevant than the density , because it is conserved for adiabatic evolution .",
    "however , the process of baryon infall is inevitably non - adiabatic and reduces the dark - matter phase - space density\\ ] ] with @xmath216 the coarse - grained phase - space density @xcite . ] .",
    "as long as the accreted baryons remain at the centre , this may not necessarily result in a reduction of the dark - matter spatial density , because the additional gravitational potential of the newly arrived baryons increases the available bound velocity - space ( phase - space at fixed position ) .    of course , a galactic wind changes the situation : the loss of some or all of the accreted baryons tips the balance towards a reduction of the dark - matter density , as convincingly demonstrated by our models of satellite removal . in the jeans - equation picture",
    "the wind removes the additional gravitational pull from the accreted baryons . in the phase - space interpretation",
    ", the wind reduces the bound velocity space , thus pressing the dark - matter phase - space fluid out of the centre , like toothpaste out of its tube .      for a dwarf spheroidal galaxy our simplistic model of baryon infall may apply even more directly .",
    "given that their present - day baryonic mass is comparable to the dark mass that needs to be rearranged in order to convert their haloes from cusped to cored , it seems plausible that for a reasonable star formation efficiency one could build the stellar component of the dsphs from a number of star clusters that fall to the centre by dynamical friction and in so doing generate a macroscopic core in the halo dark matter distribution of the dsph . for this to work , the clusters need to remain largely unscathed by tides before they reach @xmath202 . @xcite",
    "have investigated the tidal disruption of star clusters orbiting in a dsph , in particular the sagittarius and fornax satellites to the milky way , and used @xmath0-body simulations to confirm the following criterion for the tidal radius @xmath96 of a globular cluster ( gc ) at radius @xmath16 within a halo @xmath217 in particular they looked at the resilience of the five gcs in fornax and found that gcs which retain bound masses of greater than approximately 95% of their total mass do not undergo tidal disruption by the halo . in our simulations the clump falls in to approximately @xmath218 at which point it has excavated the mass in the centre of the halo and reduced the central density . at a corresponding radius in the simulations of @xcite , four of the gcs are still very stable against tidal disruption .",
    "the fifth one is only disrupted when it spends a large fraction of a hubble time at a radius in the range corresponding to @xmath219 of our model .    in a similar way we can look at the stability of gcs in low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "@xcite investigated the density profiles of a number of lsb galaxies and attempted to fit them using nfw and pseudo - isothermal halo models .",
    "their best - fit nfw models should give an upper limit to the density in the inner halo and therefore the one most likely able to disrupt an infalling object .",
    "using these we find a range of values for @xmath220 at @xmath100 scale radii ranging from 0.012 to @xmath221 .",
    "these are lower than the corresponding value for fornax which is @xmath222 .",
