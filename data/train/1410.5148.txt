    "quantum entanglement is one of the most interesting properties of quantum mechanics which was noted since early times of theory @xcite .",
    "nowadays , this property has been exploited by quantum applications as central aspect to improve information processing in terms of capacity and speed @xcite .",
    "thus , quantum information studies entanglement as an important aspect to codify and manage information in several quantum applications developed since seminal proposals in quantum computation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and discoveries about superdense coding @xcite and teleportation @xcite . a complete entanglement map of road will not be constructed until its quantification and behavior could be understood since a general mathematical theory and a deep knowledge about quantum interactions which generates it .",
    "it last means , hamiltonian models which are able to generate entanglement , which are actually studied in order to understand how this quantum feature is generated on several physical systems . for magnetic systems , ising model @xcite in statistical physics and heisenberg model @xcite in quantum mechanics are hamiltonian models derived from interaction between spin systems when they include a magnetic field , it works as a driven element in hamiltonian .",
    "nielsen @xcite was the first reporting studies of entanglement in magnetic systems based on a two spin systems using that model including an external magnetic field .",
    "magnetic driven ising interaction is well known by developing an evolution depending on local parameters .",
    "still its simplicity , for only two particles it exhibit four energy levels introducing a non periodical behavior in terms of rabi frequencies phenomenon and their control @xcite .",
    "several simplified models has been analyzed in order to understand quantum behavior of these kind of systems when they approach to different concrete systems as quantum dots or electronic gases .",
    "still , research around of control and entanglement in bipartite qubits @xcite and lattices @xcite is fundamental because these simple systems let the possibility to control quantum states of a single or a couple of electron spins at time , standing at the heart of developments towards a scalable spin - based quantum computer .    control being depicted , in combination with controlled exchange between neighboring spins , would let obtain universal quantum operations @xcite in agreement with divincenzo criteria @xcite in terms of reliability of state preparation and identification of well identified qubits .",
    "thus , the aim of this paper is analyze algebraic properties of a bipartite system with a general three dimensional anisotropic ising interaction including an inhomogeneous magnetic field strength in a fixed direction .",
    "one of the central aspects is that analysis of dynamics is conducted on a non - local basis in terms of classical bell states , which lets to discover outstanding algebraic aspects of this interaction around entanglement and a regular group structure , obtaining possible direct applications for quantum control and quantum computer processing .",
    "different models of ising interaction ( xx , xy , xyz depending on focus given by each author ) has been considered in order to reproduce calculations related with bipartite and tripartite systems @xcite ) .",
    "similar models which requires interaction with radiation are modeled in terms of jaynes - cummings and jaynes - cummings - hubbard hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "as example , in quantum control , different versions of ising interaction have been considered in terms of homogeneity of magnetic field , dimensions and directions involved @xcite .",
    "thus , restrictions in dimensions , number of particles and strength of external fields in these models are due for simplicity , geometry of lattices and other properties of physical systems involved @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the following hamiltonian for the bipartite anisotropic ising model @xcite including an inhomogeneous magnetic field restricted to the @xmath0-direction ( @xmath1 corresponding with @xmath2 respectively ) :    @xmath3    which attempts to generalize most of several models considered in the cited works before . by diagonalizing and finding the corresponding eigenvalues , which are independent of @xmath1 :",

    "it is known that when anisotropic ising evolution matrix is expressed in the computational basis , it has in general a complex full form ( with full 4 @xmath14 4 entries complex and different of zero ) , except if magnetic field is in @xmath15 direction @xcite , which denotes the privileged basis selected .",
    "for this reason , in the next section , the analysis will be based on bell state basis to develop a different structure in it .",
    "this selection suggests to change the notation by using @xmath13 for lower and upper scripts .",
    "nevertheless , when these labels appear in mathematical expressions , it will be convenient recover them to express operations , so they will be assumed as @xmath16 respectively when they are forming part of algebraic expressions .",
    "reader should be alert about it . in the same sense ,",
    "capital scripts @xmath17 will be reserved for @xmath18 referred to the computational basis ; greek scripts will reserved for @xmath16 or @xmath13 ; latin scripts @xmath19 will reserved spatial coordinates @xmath2 or @xmath8 ; and @xmath20 ( between parenthesis ) as scripts for energy levels @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 will be used sometimes to emphasize number multiplication between terms in scripts and avoid confusions .",
    "for example , in this notation we will write the standard bell states as :    @xmath23      in last terms , @xmath24 correspond with @xmath25 respectively and they could written in the current notation as :    @xmath26    the corresponding eigenvectors for each direction @xmath0 are :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the custom kronecker delta .",
    "an arbitrary bipartite state is written in computational basis or in bell basis respectively as :    @xmath29    then it is possible demonstrate by direct calculation that concurrence and schmidt coefficients @xcite , in terms of coefficients @xmath30 , are in the bell basis :    @xmath31    so , for eigenstates @xmath32 , coefficients are simply :    @xmath33    then , their entropy of entanglement becomes :    @xmath34    which is maximal only if @xmath35 ( symmetric or antisymmetric fields ) , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "using last expressions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors , and introducing the following convenient definitions related with energy levels :    @xmath36    and :    @xmath37    then , if evolution operator is written in bell basis as :    @xmath38    so , for those elements different from zero , its explicit form becomes :    @xmath39    which gives close forms for evolution operators in each case when they are expressed in the non - local basis of bell states .",
    "it express , in some sense , more explicitly the evolution of entanglement .",
    "reader should note that scripts @xmath13 in variables defined in current section are related with energy labels more than internal operations ( as in @xmath40 ) as before .",

    ", they form groups .",

    "in addition , we state the symbol @xmath60 to each set of matrices able to be generated by @xmath49 in ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) . in them ,",
    "the general structure for their @xmath43 sectors in @xmath55 is :    @xmath61    where @xmath0 denotes the associated spatial coordinate of magnetic field , @xmath62 is an ordering label for sector as it appears in the rows of the evolution matrix , corresponding with @xmath63 , the labels for its rows in each matrix of ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) ( by example , @xmath64 are the labels for the second sector , @xmath65 , in @xmath66 it means @xmath67 .",
    "note particularly that determinant for each sector , @xmath68 , are reciprocal because @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath70 as was previously stated , but not all elements of @xmath55 is a @xmath71 for any parameters",
    "@xmath72 ( because the form of @xmath73 in entries @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , which not a general complex number because their arguments are limited to integer or half integer factors of @xmath76 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath71 is not necessarily a subgroup of @xmath55 , which open opportunities to extend their coverage in @xmath55 with two o more pulses .    for a further discussion",
    ", it is notable to write the generic sector in exponential form in terms of pauli matrices :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the @xmath80 identity matrix and @xmath81 is the matrix sector with lacking of its numeric exponential factor , which is defined by further convenience .",
    "that structure shows that each kind of interaction ( with external magnetic field in @xmath82 ) exclusively transforms bell states in specific pairs as a @xmath83 operation plus a phase term in @xmath84 .",
    "then , each sector for a given @xmath0 is responsible to combine linearly two bell states @xmath85 and @xmath86 under a @xmath87 operation , with :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the sum module 2 .",
    "thus , it is possible associate , by eliminating the sector phase @xmath90 and instantaneous exponential factor in component @xmath85 ( it is equivalent to use a certain rotating frame to whole system ) , a bloch sphere between @xmath85 and @xmath86 in which , each part of @xmath91 in ( [ twoqubit ] ) corresponding with each sector :    @xmath92    evolves locally driven by @xmath93 in sector @xmath94 .",
    "note that this evolution does not change probabilities between parts in each sector , but introduces relative phases because @xmath90 and the complex mixing generated by @xmath95 .",
    "clearly @xmath95 are elements of a lie group with parameters @xmath96 , which will be important further .",
    "figure [ fig0 ] shows bell states related with several interactions @xmath97 or @xmath98 in ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) . each dotted line is a linear combination of states in their vertex ( [ psij ] ) .",
    "given a initial state of this type and depending on interaction being considered ( @xmath99 ) , evolution , for this part of quantum state , develops on a bloch sphere as a trajectory , depicted in scheme on right - down , which shows its evolution trajectory for some pair @xmath85 and @xmath86 related by an specific interaction in their respective bloch sphere .    by combining several adequate interactions , could be possible switch any bell state into another ( figure 1 ) if sectors @xmath93 adopt the following combined forms for @xmath100 ( referred in the following as diagonalization and antidiagonalization cases respectively ) :    @xmath101    thus , by combining these two types of sector forms , we can achieve evolution loops @xcite and exchange operations @xcite in @xmath102 for bell states , which will let obtain several control effects .",
    "note that last expressions give only the matrix form for one sector @xmath93 , avoiding a confusion between operators in computational basis and bell basis by the use of pauli matrices @xmath103 in last expression , which are used only to set a desired form in that matrix sector .",
    "clearly , much more equivalent cases could be considered with arbitrary phases instead of only @xmath104 phases , but we will restrict our analysis to these cases .      in spite of ( [ schmbell ] ) and ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) , concurrence of states evolved from bell states could be easily obtained .",
    "short calculations show that concurrence @xmath105 for evolution @xmath49 for bell state @xmath106 is easily expressed as :    @xmath107    showing that it depends only on one rabi frequency at time in a very simply way .",
    "this expression is consistent with isotropic case reported in @xcite .",
    "note that ( [ bellentanglement ] ) reproduces those results because this expression does not imply that states comeback each period to the original bell state , only to the same entanglement value .",
    "clearly , bell states could become separable intermediately if @xmath108 , which is possible if @xmath105 reaches its maximum value when @xmath109 .",
    "in isotropic cases , some bell states are invariant when magnetic field is symmetric or antisymmetric , as was shown in @xcite , which in general does not happen here .",
    "all this scenario contrasts with evolution of some separable states , by example those of computational basis @xmath110 , whose entanglement expressions depends normally on all or several rabi frequencies involved , generally resulting in a non periodical behavior .",
    "thus , in some sense , entanglement instead of separability appears as a natural feature of ising model inclusive with external magnetic fields .      of course , last evolution operators are related via an homogeneous bipartite rotation in terms of euler angles @xcite on hilbert space @xmath111 and on fock space @xmath102 :    @xmath112    where :    @xmath113    expressed in the computational basis .",
    "as is expected , different ising models with magnetic fields in cartesian directions transform between them . specifically :    @xmath114    an aspect to remark is that sectors ( [ sector ] ) in ising evolution matrix could reproduce the form of ( [ rotation ] ) .",
    "nevertheless that single isolated qubit rotations by magnetic fields are well known , here this is not a trivial aspect because we are using a representation in bell basis instead of computational basis as in last expression .",
    "it means that , under certain conditions , bell states rotate as a whole .",
    "this is not necessarily a physical rotation , but bell states , by pairs corresponding to rows where that sector is located , are transforming between them under these specific driven ising interactions as a rotation in a bloch sphere with main states as those bell states instead of classical @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "previously has been stated that evolution operators @xmath49 are part of subgroup @xmath117 in @xmath54 defined by their form in ( [ subgroups ] ) .",
    "but there are a inner structure which can be found in terms of group properties , which are not only related with the form of these operators but instead with their quantum structure related with ising hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in this section , we analyze specific structure and restrictions in ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) to @xmath118 becomes a subgroup , together with traditional operator or matrix product in terms of their physical properties .",
    "it means , the physical prescriptions on @xmath119 parameters for each sector with which @xmath49 fulfills a group structure :    @xmath120    where @xmath49 is understood to have the structure in ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) .",
    "clearly associativity and existence of identity ( @xmath121 ) are fulfilled because covering @xmath54 structure .",
    "thus , only the product closure and existence of inverse should be analyzed . because @xmath60 , sector structure is accomplished and analysis of previous conditions can be almost restricted to sectors @xmath71 ( note only that exponential factor in each sector is the inverse of its respective factor in other sector , so both should be compatible in addition ) .      in spite of sector properties of matrices in @xmath122 , inverse of @xmath49 reduces to obtain inverse of each sector ( caring compatibility around of their exponential factors ) .",
    "because generic sector ( [ sector ] ) is unitary , its inverse is :    @xmath123    thus , conditions for a generic sector ( [ sector ] ) mimicking last expression can be obtained by comparing entries @xmath124 with @xmath125 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 in @xmath126 .",
    "this comparison shows that there are two possible restrictions to make compatible those four equations :    @xmath127    with which , only two additional equations remains , by example for entries @xmath124 and @xmath74 :    @xmath128    equation ( [ inversesectorcond1a ] ) automatically fulfills the compatibility between sectors because exponential factor becomes real . combining this condition ( [ inversesectorcond2 ] ) ,",
    "we get several cases .",
    "the most general is obtained noting that in spite of ( [ inversesectorcond2b ] ) , @xmath129 .",
    "after , to fulfill ( [ inversesectorcond2a ] ) , it is required that @xmath130 which implies @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 . with these conditions , @xmath134 , with form ( [ sector ] ) , converts into ( [ inversesector ] ) . while , a brief analysis of equation ( [ inversesectorcond1b ] ) into ( [ inversesectorcond2 ] ) , shows that it reduces to a special case of last solution .",
    "thus , the general prescriptions to get the inverse effect of an ising interaction with a similar interaction but changing physical parameters are :    @xmath135    note that last prescriptions are compatible with prescriptions of evolution loops in two pulses .",
    "still , there is a pair of particular solutions .",
    "the first case , where @xmath136 corresponds to matrices with @xmath137 with @xmath138 which is the form of sectors in diagonal form @xmath139 , whose inverse is simply @xmath140 :    @xmath141    where @xmath142 are @xmath143 independently . with exception of freedom in selection of sign in @xmath144 ,",
    "these prescriptions agree with ( [ inverseprescriptions ] ) .",
    "an possible additional case , which appears when equations ( [ inversesectorcond2 ] ) are solved , is the case with @xmath145 .",
    "nevertheless that this case is completely included in solution ( [ inverseprescriptions ] ) , it states a specific kind of evolution matrices with @xmath71 of form :    @xmath146    note that when @xmath147 this sector remembers hadamard - like gates .",
    "nevertheless that prescriptions to get inverses are well defined , they involves sometimes conditions on @xmath148 which are not possible fulfill in specific experimental designs in terms to find @xmath149 in terms of @xmath150 . instead ,",
    "sometimes some of @xmath151 should fulfill strong restrictions ( precisely those equivalent to evolution loops prescriptions stated before ) .",
    "last means that inverse evolution for one pulse is not always achievable under general restrictions with other one pulse evolution , despite of inverse is well defined as part of matrices ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) .      to probe the product closure and to obtain the prescriptions on physical parameters",
    ", we can restrict our discussion to sectors again , caring the global matching between exponential factors in ( [ sector ] ) .",
    "thus , it is necessary probe the matching between @xmath152 in :    @xmath153    with @xmath154 with the form in ( [ sector ] ) .",
    "demonstration is straight but it requires some transformations which we outline briefly . again , comparing sectors we note that respective equations are compatible only if :    @xmath155    with @xmath156 .",
    "if this equation fulfills , then only two equations remain , for entries :    @xmath157    equation ( [ closeeq1b ] ) traduces in two equations for real and imaginary parts respectively :    @xmath158    then , applying the following transformations @xmath159 , last equations become :    @xmath160    following the same process for equation ( [ closeeq1a ] ) , we obtain that equations for real and imaginary parts become :    @xmath161    still , we require that right side in each equation ( [ closeeq2br]-[closeeq1ai ] ) really represent the expression on their left side .",
    "more precisely , we need that the following expression becomes one :    @xmath162    which , together with ( [ closeeq1ai ] ) should be fulfilled .",
    "there are two possible solutions : a ) @xmath163 , which is equivalent to @xmath164 or @xmath165 , leaving one of them free .",
    "this solution is trivial because it implies that one of matrices in the product is proportional to the identity ; b ) @xmath166 , which automatically implies @xmath167 .",
    "this situation is trivial when @xmath168 and @xmath169 do not change because it means constant fields .",
    "but if interaction strengths could be manipulated , then it means ( for @xmath170 ) :    @xmath171    there is one relevant aspect which could be noticed here departing from expressions ( [ closeeq2br]-[closeeq1ai ] ) . by considering that all parameters @xmath172 are free ( until their internal and relative natural restrictions ) , these right side expressions have a variation between @xmath173 $ ] in such way that magnitude of each entry can reach the unit value as before",
    "nevertheless , by comparison with one pulse case where only multiple integer or multiple semi - integer values are possible , phases in antidiagonal entries can , independently from diagonal ones , reach values in a continuous range inside of @xmath174 but without cover last complete range .",
    "this behavior suggest that multiple pulses could extend @xmath71 coverage into @xmath55 ( or easier , @xmath95 coverage into @xmath83 ) .",
    "summarizing , the prescriptions for product closure in the last terms are :    @xmath175    showing that each family of evolution matrices ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) do not form a group at least that @xmath166 ( which automatically implies @xmath167 .",
    "this aspect is important because it implies that effect of two o more pulses of magnetic field can not be always replaced with effects achievable by one pulse .",
    "these results are consistent with baker - campbell - hausdorff formula for @xmath83 reported in @xcite :    @xmath176    where @xmath14 denotes the vector product",
    ". then , clearly if @xmath177 , both vectors become parallel and prescriptions ( [ productprescriptions ] ) are recovered by comparing with ( [ shjexp ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath84 factor is abelian and only the part @xmath178 exhibit a more complex form .",
    "particularly a non vanishing term @xmath179 makes non commutative both sectors .",
    "coverage of two o more pulses @xmath95 into @xmath83 could be understood from expression ( [ expproduct ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath180 ranges in @xmath173 $ ] independently of @xmath181 , when @xmath182 or @xmath183 with @xmath184 , leaving other parameter free .",
    "last is required to @xmath185 have a complete coverage into @xmath83 .",
    "unfortunately while this variation is nearer from @xmath104 ( @xmath186 , @xmath182 or @xmath183 ) , @xmath187 have a more limited coverage on unitary sphere as is required to reproduce @xmath83 .      in spite of formulas ( [ inverseprescriptions ] ) and ( [ productprescriptions ] ) , it is clear that @xmath188 can be absorbed as a coefficient of @xmath189 .",
    "otherwise , last is equivalent to fix @xmath190 positive in each group element together with its sign of @xmath191 . because ( [ shjexp ] ) , last is equivalent to group those elements by a common unitary vector @xmath192 . in @xmath193 , each group",
    "is characterized by a set of two fixed values @xmath194 and two signs @xmath195 correspondingly with signs of @xmath196 .",

    "note that parameters @xmath204 generate multifolded group elements because periodicity of expressions , it means , several of them generate same group elements in each @xmath203 but they correspond to different evolution dynamics .",
    "same is true for terms @xmath205 in ( [ productprescriptions ] ) , which state several alternatives to reproduce an equivalent evolution matrix for two consecutive pulses , more than @xmath206 .",
    "unfortunately for control purposes , this periodicity is not always in the time variable .",
    "thus , in terms of last subsection , each subgroup @xmath198 ( for each @xmath1 ) becomes an abelian group .",
    "in addition , because that @xmath207 is not a global phase in @xmath49 at least that it reduces to @xmath104 .",
    "then these relative phase works as an interference frequency in superposition states containing terms of bell states related with both sectors ( separable or partially entangled ) .",
    "because rotations explained before , @xmath208 , transforms elements of each @xmath117 into other @xmath209 , then subgroups @xmath210 are clearly isomorphic @xcite between them under these rotations .",
    "moreover , if @xmath211 is a transformation with properties :    @xmath212    then , in spite of ( [ productprescriptions ] ) , @xmath198 and @xmath213 become isomorphic because product structure is preserved :    @xmath214    note that in spite ( [ closeeq1ai ] ) , if prescription ( [ condition ] ) is fulfilled , then @xmath215 will commute at sector level ( yet , prescription should be fulfilled for @xmath199 in order that @xmath216 commute ) . nevertheless , is easy note that ( [ condition ] ) automatically implies @xmath217 .",

    "the following additional sets and subgroups are notable in terms of group theory , which will be shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the first one are the subgroups in @xmath198 :    @xmath220    which clearly correspond to those where sectors phases @xmath221 have been removed .",
    "this subgroup contains the @xmath222 matrices defined in ( [ shjexp ] ) . in particular , @xmath223 is the diagonal matrix whose sectors have only opposite phases in each entry ( taking @xmath224 as exception to our notation in ( [ graldiag2 ] ) because @xmath225 ) .",
    "matrices in this subgroup are responsible to introduce relative phases between bell states associated with the same sector .",
    "other relevant subgroup is :    @xmath226    they correspond precisely to matrices @xmath227 presented before , responsible to introduce relative phases between bell states associated with different sectors . these matrices are contained in any @xmath228 so they commute with any matrix in @xmath218 and inclusively in @xmath203 .",
    "thus , in terms of group theory , @xmath229 is a normal group @xcite of @xmath203 : @xmath230 . in a related sense , given a subgroup @xmath231 in @xmath232 , the left cosets ( similarly for right cosets )",
    "are defined as sets :    @xmath233    with this , we can set a result of group theory . because @xmath229 is a normal group , then the set denoted by @xmath234 of left ( or right ) cosets on bigger group @xmath232 ( possible groups represented by @xmath232 are @xmath235 or inclusively @xmath54 ) which contains @xmath229 ,",
    "is the quotient group @xcite of @xmath232 by @xmath229 .",
    "it can be understood as a homomorphism on @xmath232 and it is easy note that @xmath229 is the kernel of this homomorphism ( the set of elements in @xmath232 which maps on @xmath229 ) .    if @xmath236 are subgroups in @xmath232 , then we define their product @xcite as :    @xmath237    which is not necessarily a group at least one of them be a normal group which is a result well known in group theory @xcite . then should be clear that :    @xmath238    under this circumstances , this set represents how @xmath229 can be understood as a merely factor on the whole structure of group @xmath232 . summarizing , in group theory language , @xmath239 is a direct product of these subgroups @xcite , which physically means that evolution operators obtained with one magnetic pulse are equivalent to two pulses , one to provide sector phases and other to reproduce the remaining dynamics free of sector phases .",
    "finally , the subgroup :    @xmath240    can be understood as responsible to introduce global phases in quantum states under interaction ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as difference with those phases introduced by @xmath241 and @xmath242 . clearly , as @xmath243 and @xmath244 , @xmath245 is isomorphic to @xmath84 .",
    "thus , similarly with @xmath229 , @xmath246 is a quotient group , representing how a global phase is a factor group @xmath84 in the structure of each possible @xmath232 in this analysis ( @xmath235 or @xmath54 ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] depicts schematically the relations between before sets and subgroups in @xmath54 .",
    "despite their representations ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) , each @xmath203 ( figure [ fig6]a ) has same group structure as a result of their isomorphic relations via rotations @xmath247 .",
    "inside , there are an infinite number of subgroups @xmath228 parametrized on @xmath248^{\\times 2 } \\times \\{\\pm\\}^{\\times 2}$ ] , which cover @xmath218 .",
    "subgroup @xmath244 contains the common elements of them .",
    "subgroups @xmath243 ( not indicated in figure ) are each one in their corresponding @xmath228 .",
    "when three groups @xmath193 are combined ( figure [ fig6]b ) , subgroup @xmath249 contains their only common elements .",
    "thus , oval regions with dotted boundary , @xmath218 , in each @xmath203 represent the evolutions achievable with only one pulse of magnetic field .",
    "instead , white semi lunar regions @xmath250 are complementary evolutions which acts locally and unitarily in each matrix sector but not able to be generated in just one pulse .",
    "other important result in group theory is that given a set of groups , by example @xmath251 , then their generated subgroup is defined as all finite products of elements and/or their inverses :    @xmath252    where @xmath253 ( in this case @xmath254 ) .",
    "then , @xmath255 have the property of being a group , which is easily demonstrable departing from group conditions .",
    "it means that finite products of elements in @xmath218 extends their coverage into @xmath203 forming a group @xcite , but it is not necessarily whole @xmath203 ( this group is depicted in figure [ fig6 ] with a gray dotted circular line ) : @xmath256 .",
    "note that @xmath255 is generated by the minimum set :    @xmath257   \\\\",
    "s_{{b_h}_{\\mp \\alpha } } = \\pm } } { { \\mathbb s}^*_h}\\substack { \\ { |{{j_h}_{\\mp \\alpha}}| \\ } \\\\ \\ { s_{{b_h}_{\\mp \\alpha } } \\ } } _ { , 0 } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , in terms of group theory , @xmath255 is a free group on @xmath258 . in these terms",
    ", @xmath259 contains all possible elements in @xmath203 which are not achievable by any finite combination of interaction pulses ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "elements in this last set have the following property : @xmath260 with @xmath261 .",
    "it follows that a ) @xmath255 self - contains their inverses ; b ) for any cosets generated by @xmath262 , then @xmath263 ; and c ) by hypothesis , no one element of @xmath259 , can be obtained as a finite product of elements of @xmath255 . as a corollary ,",
    "the product of an even number of elements @xmath264 of @xmath259 becomes element of @xmath255 , while the product of an odd number remains in this set .",
    "note that formula ( [ expproduct ] ) is useful and easy to determine how two pulses @xmath265 with @xmath266 not parallel generate elements outside of @xmath218 . because form of @xmath267 in ( [ expproduct ] ) , it shows too that for @xmath268 with given @xmath269 and @xmath270 respectively , then it is not possible to find correspondingly a @xmath271 which fulfill @xmath272 at least @xmath273 will be parallel and then @xmath274 ( owning to same subgroup ) . then , finite products in @xmath218 are not trivial because they can not easily be rearranged to simplify their structure , except in the case when two pulses belong to the same group @xmath275 .    as @xmath83 , each set of sectors in a given @xmath228 group is a lie group with @xmath189 as parameter . a result in lie group theory is that every element of the connected subgroup of any linear lie group can be expressed as a finite product of exponentials of its real linear lie algebra @xcite .",
    "so , if sectors of elements in @xmath255 are connected , it will imply that this last group is @xmath83 really .",
    "we can analyze connectivity with help of formula ( [ expproduct ] ) .",
    "clearly elements in @xmath228 have @xmath267 restricted to planes @xmath276 or @xmath277 ( or @xmath278,@xmath279 but not associated with physical directions ) depending of @xmath0 parity .",
    "thus , @xmath280 in ( [ expproduct ] ) is orthogonal to these vectors . with this",
    ", we can define the following orthonormal vector basis ( figure [ fig8 ] ) :    @xmath281    where @xmath282 .",
    "then , it is possible to express @xmath187 in ( [ expproduct ] ) in a spherical system of coordinates as :    @xmath283    becoming when we solve :    @xmath284    which solves the desired output element in terms of input parameters .",
    "right side expression for @xmath285 ranges between @xmath173 $ ] as is required ( it can be shown by combining two last expressions and then obtaining their extreme values ) .",
    "a brief analysis shows that @xmath286 ranges in @xmath287 .",
    "then , two pulses in different groups @xmath228 can be adequately selected to reproduce a general element in @xmath83 ( still , cases when @xmath288 can be obtained as limit cases ; some of them are cases discussed before for diagonal or antidiagonal forms ) .",
    "clearly , there are several solutions because they depend only on @xmath289 , the angle between original vectors @xmath267 and @xmath290 , more than representation of specific vectors being considered . with this , @xmath291 .",
    "this result is useful because states that elements in @xmath83 are products of sectors in @xmath49 . with this",
    ", each element in @xmath203 can be obtained in a finite number of pulses , each one belonging to @xmath228 groups .",
    "this analysis state algebraic properties for solutions ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) of ising interaction model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) being considered .",
    "this perspective lets combine them for different purposes in control , gates and states design between others .",
    "physical systems as molecules to set databases @xcite , magnetic molecular clusters and dielectric nanometer - size single domain to set quantum information processing @xcite , spins in quantum dots formed in gaas heterostructures , nanowire - based quantum dots or self - assembled quantum dots as suitable qubits @xcite , are some examples of physical systems on which spin control has been experimented .",
    "part of idea in those systems is to have sufficient ability to have single resources on which set quantum computation and quantum information processing in terms of before quantum computer models @xcite with programmable spin ",
    "spin couplings as some of shown here .",
    "it is clear through these examples that different physical systems can converge on very similar kind of interactions which require deep analysis of their models to be experimentally exploited .",
    "in addition , it is clear that as experimental and technology advance , then more fine control has been applied to control paths , stable equilibrium , confinement and quantum states of course .",
    "then , models with extended parameters of control should be analyzed because them could bring a better performance in the quantum states control arena .",
    "these theoretical developments sooner or later meet with experimental developments in order to become useful in quantum engineering .    nevertheless that models with several couplings including more that two qubits at time , these trends are studied to improve some proposals of superdense coding , multi - entangled processing , quantum walks and other which require it . despite control",
    "is being improved , it has been clear that decoherence in a multiqubits deployments increases easily with their parts number , so manipulate lots of qubits coordinately becomes difficult in a growing array @xcite .",
    "thus , alternative well controlled developments based on a few quantum qubits at time should be developed to implement quantum algorithms being constructed specifically to these kind of systems while multipartite control is better understood and improved .",
    "circuit - gate model of quantum computers could be based in great extent on bipartite systems when ancilla qubits are used .",
    "clearly , extensions to a few more qubits will be necessary still because such quantum stuff requires a system of several qubits to make some task efficiently and the main materials based technology known for that is magnetic .",
    "the most of them exploits ising interactions with different approaches @xcite , together with control on quantum states and in particular with entanglement control , a milestone in all almost these researches .",
    "analysis presented in this work states some properties which generalize some restricted models used in several approaches and experimental setups . in this sense",
    ", three dimensional model can reduce to simplified models but brings potentially extensions in those models and technologies .",
    "circuit - gate model was the first approach to quantum computation , nevertheless , quantum annealing @xcite or measurement - based quantum computation @xcite are alternatives which use magnetic systems approached by ising interactions to manage a planned and controlled quantum state manipulation . by example , @xcite has proposed a scheme to simulate the ising model and preserve the maximum entangled states ( bell states ) in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) driven by a classical field with large detuning . on them , several applied problems has been exhibited as the goal of ( these technologies ( pattern matching , folding proteins , an other particular np - complete problems @xcite ) .    in these directions ,",
    "solution for ising model presented here ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be applied for more controlled situations including more than three freedom degrees .",
    "magneto - optic traps an qed cavities could tentatively manage control of position and contain particles , ions or molecules leaving still three directions for spin - spin coupling .",
    "still , not all of specific effects need use three dimensional freedom degrees but other developments can extent their external and internal dynamics into three dimensions ( by example , @xcite , has been reported three dimensional tracking of quantum dots ) .",
    "future work for model and solutions ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) presented could be based in different research lines .",
    "one proposal is to grown the analysis to control of elementary pieces to set adequate resources in circuit - gate quantum computer in terms of ( [ evloop]-[exch ] ) .",
    "control procedures as evolution loops or exchange operations states a basic structure and language of manipulation to maintain or transform qubits selectively .",
    "this basic language lets translate the circuit - gate quantum computation algorithms into physical operations based on realistic systems .",
    "after of control analysis to set stable and recoverable quantum resources , other possible extensions are based on statement of a computer grammar based on those resources ( as states figure [ fig0 ] and structure depicted in terms of bloch sphere to pairs of bell states .",
    "an outstanding aspect here was the introduction of non local basis to depicts dynamics , which uncover the regular forms in ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) with well understood group structures .",
    "it is possible that for models including more qubits , this structure could be maintained in terms of an adequate basis of maximal entangled states as in ( [ evop2 ] ) for two qubits . in terms of these expressions ,",
    "our interaction appear as operate almost independently on pairs of maximal entangled states .",
    "another extension is to exploit possibilities for two pulses expression ( [ twopulses ] ) or in general a finite product of pulses , which extend group dominion on @xmath117 .",
    "still , combination of those operators for different values of @xmath0 should be studied to state its coverage on @xmath54 .    in this line of research , the analysis of behavior with finite temperature based on matrix density is compulsory to consider decoherence effects . at same time , error correction analysis is necessary in procedures which emerge of present model , based on error factors ( as magnetic field , knowledge and control of interaction strengths , time , etc . ) . in our approach , of course improvements should be generated through to alternative continuous pulses .",
    "rectangular pulses are easy to manage theoretically but reality is that they are experimentally few practical because their discontinuity and associated resonant effects .    just as control development advances , more complex models can be experimented .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance , quantum dots and electrons in silicon lattices have been the most successful systems in implementing quantum algorithms based on their coherence and stability .",
    "if quantum computation could be based on entangled basis as a grammar , despite the actual complications about their maintenance , it could be a more understandable language to generate a programming basis because they are adapted to physical systems where they are set up .",
    "in that terms , proposals as here presented increase potentially their value .",
