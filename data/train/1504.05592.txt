    "the fastsound survey is a galaxy redshift survey using the near - infrared ( nir ) fiber multi - object spectrograph ( fmos ) mounted on the subaru telescope @xcite , which detected @xmath04,000 line emitters at 1.431.67 @xmath13 m with a line sensitivity limit of @xmath14 ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the majority of these are expected to be h@xmath1 emitters at @xmath15 , because emitters at this flux level have very high h@xmath1/[oiii ] ratios and therefore very low [ oiii ] contamination @xcite .",
    "the fastsound observations have already been completed , with the total surveyed area of 20.6 deg@xmath3 in the four fields of the cfhtls wide survey @xcite .",
    "the primary scientific objective is to measure the structure growth rate [ i.e. , @xmath16 using the redshift space distortion ( rsd ) , motivated by the modified gravity scenario for the origin of the mysterious acceleration of cosmic expansion ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "rsd measurements have been obtained mainly by redshift surveys at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "fastsound aims to detect and measure the growth rate in the unexplored redshift range at a significance of @xmath18 .",
    "the fastsound data will also be useful for general studies on galaxy formation and evolution , like the past major galaxy redshift surveys at @xmath19 in optical and nir bands @xcite .",
    "this is the second of the fastsound paper series , in which we describe the fastsound catalog and present basic properties of the detected emission lines and their host galaxies .",
    "line identification is an important issue in fastsound , because most ( @xmath20 70% ) of the detected galaxies have only one emission line , due to the narrow wavelength range .",
    "we expect that the majority of the fastsound emission lines are h@xmath1 , because of the strength of h@xmath1 and our target selection to maximize the probability of finding h@xmath1 emitters by photometric estimates of redshift and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "indeed , a previous study estimated the non - h@xmath1 contamination rate for fastsound to be @xmath2110% @xcite by using the data of the hizels narrow - band survey in nir @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated this rate to be @xmath030% at a similar flux limit from line luminosity functions , which is consistent with the estimate by @xcite that takes into account the fastsound target selection preferring strong h@xmath1 emitters . nevertheless , a more precise estimate of the contamination rate is important for high precision clustering analyses to derive cosmological information .",
    "therefore we evaluate the non - h@xmath1 contamination rate using the fastsound data , based on the statistics of galaxies with multiple lines and the stacked spectrum of all fastsound galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the fastsound catalog is described in   [ elcatalog ] , and the properties of emission line galaxies in the catalog are discussed in   [ property ] .",
    "we estimate the non - h@xmath1 contamination in the catalog in   [ section : contamination ] , followed by conclusions in   [ conclusion ] . throughout this paper , the standard @xmath22cdm cosmology with the parameters",
    "@xmath23 is assumed , where @xmath24 .",
    "the fastsound catalog data set consists of the three tables : ( 1 ) _ the fov - information list _ for the record and statistics of each fmos field - of - view ( fov ) observed in the fastsound survey , ( 2 ) _ the galaxy catalog _ that describes the properties and line - detection statistics for all galaxies selected as the fastsound targets , and ( 3 ) _ the emission line catalog _ that includes all the emission line candidates detected by the software field as described in paper i. these three tables are given separately for the four cfhtls wide fields observed by the fastsound survey , and detailed descriptions are given below .",
    "the fov - information list is provided so that users can get information about each of the 121 fmos fovs observed in the fastsound survey .",
    "the basic properties of each fov , such as the observation date , fmos fov i d ( e.g. , w1_011 meaning the 11th fmos fov in the w1 field ) , and central coordinates are given .",
    "( see table [ table : catalog_description_fov ] for the list of entries in this table . )",
    "we also provided statistics for the number of galaxies and emission lines , such as the number of target galaxies sent to the fiber allocation software ( @xmath26 ) , the number of galaxies actually observed by fmos fibers ( @xmath27 ) , the number of galaxies with at least one detected emission line at @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , and the total number of detected emission line candidates ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the statistics of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given not only for the normal frames but also the inverted frames .",
    "fmos has two spectrographs , irs1 and irs2 , each of which covers about 200 objects .",
    "therefore these numbers are given separately for irs1 and irs2 .",
    "the information about observing conditions is also given , such as the mean seeing .",
    "the mean seeing for each fov is derived from the 2d optical image of coordinate calibration stars ( ccs , typically 17 ccss in a fov ) by fitting it with a gaussian profile .",
    "an important quantity is @xmath31 calculated using the flux calibration stars ( fcs , typically eight fcss in a fov ) . for each fcs we calculated @xmath32 , which is the ratio of the uncalibrated flux within the fiber aperture ( @xmath33 , see  [ section : emission - line - catalog ] below ) to the total stellar flux in the literature ( see  5 of paper i ) .",
    "then the average in a fov is calculated as @xmath31 .",
    "the line fluxes @xmath34 are _ not _ corrected for the observing conditions , and hence the factor @xmath35 should be multiplied to get a flux that is calibrated by fcss and corrected for the fiber aperture effect ( assuming a point source ) . for extended sources , further corrections",
    "are necessary .",
    "see  [ section : emission - line - catalog ] for the method of calculating the emission line fluxes of fastsound galaxies used in this paper .",
    "emission line detection efficiency for a galaxy observed by fmos is not uniform over the observed fastsounds fields , because of variable weather and hardware conditions .",
    "this can be estimated by the ratio @xmath36 . for a galaxy selected as a fastsound target ,",
    "the mean probability of being actually observed is @xmath080% ( typically , 360 fibers allocated to 440 targets per fov , see fig . 5 of paper i ) in the fiber allocation procedure .",
    "the line detection efficiency against the target galaxies , including this effect , can be estimated by the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "this efficiency would be useful for a clustering analysis of the spatial galaxy distribution .",
    "the galaxy catalog provides various information for individual galaxies , including not only those actually observed by fmos but also all the galaxies meeting the selection criteria of the fastsound target galaxies , which were sent to the fiber allocation software of fmos ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "see table [ table : catalog_description_gal ] for the list of items in this catalog . as basic information of a galaxy ,",
    "the following quantities are given : the cfhtls - w i d in the catalog of @xcite , ra , dec , and cfhtls optical magnitudes .",
    "the near - infrared @xmath38 magnitudes of the ukidss dxs [ dr8 , @xcite ] are also added where available ( only in w1 and w4 fields ) .",
    "the galactic extinction by the extinction map of @xcite is also given , and these magnitudes have been corrected for this .",
    "the physical quantities estimated by the photometric sed fittings performed for target selection are also provided : photometric redshift ( @xmath39 ) , sfr , stellar mass ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 , and h@xmath1 flux estimate ( see paper i for the fitting method ) . the median , the likelihood peak value , and 68% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "lower and upper bounds derived by the photometric redshift code _",
    "@xcite are given for @xmath42 , sfr , and @xmath40 in the table .",
    "when the likelihood function does not have a simple form , the likelihood peak value may be outside the range between the 68% c.l .",
    "lower and upper limits .",
    "the 68% c.l .",
    "upper and lower limits for h@xmath1 flux estimates are based on those for sfr .",
    "the number of fmos observations for a galaxy , @xmath43 , is zero if no fiber was allocated to it . in each fov , observation was done with only one fiber allocation pattern , and hence most galaxies observed by fmos have @xmath44 , though it can be two or larger for some galaxies in fov overlapping regions .",
    "we also provide the number of detected emission lines for each galaxy ( @xmath45 , see the next section for details ) .",
    "since the typical probability of detecting emission lines from a target galaxy is about 10% in the fastsound survey , this catalog includes about 10 times more galaxies than those in the emission line catalog , and about 90% of them have @xmath46 .",
    "the reasons for this relatively low detection efficiency are discussed in @xcite and paper i.      the quantities presented in the emission line catalog are summarized in table [ table : catalog_description_el ] .",
    "this catalog includes all emission line candidates detected by the line detection software field [ @xcite ; paper i ] , and the same emission line in a galaxy may be included as more than one entry in the catalog , if its host galaxy was observed more than once in the overlapping fastsound fovs .",
    "the line candidates are identified by the fastsound i d , which consists of the fastsound fov i d , the used spectrograph ( irs1 or 2 ) , the fmos fiber i d ( 1200 for each of irs1 and 2 ) , and the line i d ( @xmath47 for the @xmath47-th line in a spectrum in increasing wavelength order ) .",
    "an example of the fastsound i d is fastsound - w1_011-irs1_009 - 1 .",
    "the line @xmath48 values are also given , which were calculated by the fixed - width kernel method used in the line candidate selection ( paper i ) .",
    "we present typical spectra of emission line candidates for various @xmath48 values in fig .",
    "[ fig : individuals ] .",
    "the emission line catalogs are provided both for the normal and inverted frames , and the statistics about spurious noise detection can be examined by using the inverted - frame catalogs .    as for the physical properties of the lines , the central wavelength ( @xmath10 ) , line flux",
    "( @xmath49 ) , and line width ( @xmath50 , not corrected for the instrumental resolution ) are provided , which were calculated by 1d gaussian fits .",
    "the line flux was integrated over all wavelengths using the best - fit gaussian , including the oh mask regions which represent sharp gaps in the wavelength coverage .",
    "note that @xmath49 in the catalog is not corrected for the point - source aperture loss due to the fibre ( as determined from the flux calibration stars ) .",
    "sometimes wavelengths of line candidates are close to the oh mask regions .",
    "an oh mask has 7  width , and about 300 and 130 masks in 0.81.9 @xmath13 m were installed for irs1 and 2 , respectively , before september 2012 .",
    "the number for irs1 is larger because it includes masks for fainter oh lines . after september 2012",
    ", the irs1 mask plate has been replaced with a new one that is the same for irs2 , and hence the oh mask patterns became the same for the two spectrographs ( see s4.3 of paper i ) . to give information about nearby oh masking for each emission line candidate",
    ", we provide the oh mask flag parameter ( 1 if the line center is within an oh mask width , 0 otherwise ) , and distance from the line center to the nearest oh mask borders ( @xmath51 ) in units of the measured velocity width @xmath50 of the line candidate .",
    "the line centers were determined by a profile fitting , and sometimes they fall in the mask regions , making the flag 1 .",
    "we provide @xmath51 for both the increasing and decreasing wavelength directions .",
    "210 line candidates have line centers overlapped with masked regions ( i.e. , the flag 1 ) among the 3,769 line candidates detected at @xmath52 ,    the total ( i.e. , corrected for the fiber aperture loss ) line flux from a galaxy ( @xmath53 ) , which is calibrated by the flux standard stars , is necessary for many studies about galaxy properties . as explained in ",
    "[ section : fov - information ] , these corrections can easily be done by using @xmath54 for point sources . for extended galaxies ,",
    "a perfect correction is difficult and it would be generally model dependent , but here we calculate @xmath55 as follows .",
    "first @xmath49 is multiplied by the factor of @xmath56 , to convert it into the total flux which would be correct if it was a point source .",
    "then we need a further correction to take into account sizes of extended galaxies .",
    "for this correction we first estimate the calibrated line flux of a galaxy within the fiber aperture ( 1.2 arcsec diameter ) , by multiplying the fiber covering fraction @xmath57 for a point source , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "the factor @xmath57 should be discriminated from @xmath31 ; the former is just the fraction of flux within the fiber aperture for point sources , while the latter is the combined factor of the fiber aperture loss and flux reduction by observing conditions such as weather .",
    "we calculated @xmath57 by assuming a two - dimensional gaussian profile with the seeing fwhm of each fov .",
    "then the final step is to correct it by using the fiber covering fraction @xmath59 for extended galaxies .",
    "though @xmath59 should depend on the surface brightness profile of individual galaxies and seeing , we adopt a constant value of @xmath60 , as estimated by @xcite based on the image size of typical fastsound galaxies . here",
    "we ignored the effect of seeing variation in different fastsound fovs on @xmath59 , but it should be smaller than that for @xmath57 because galaxies are extended sources . taking into account the galactic extinction , the final flux",
    "is then obtained as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the galactic extinction magnitude at the observed wavelength , calculated from the galactic @xmath63 in the catalog and the milky - way extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "the flux @xmath53 is also given in the emission line catalog .    sometimes lines are blended with nearby lines by line widths comparable with line separations . in the fastsound line detection process ,",
    "line @xmath48 peaks are treated as independent lines when their separation is more than 20 pixels ( @xmath64   ) , corresponding to a velocity difference of @xmath65 km / s .",
    "therefore , there is no blending among different line candidates in the catalog if their velocity dispersions are typical for normal galaxies ( @xmath21 200 km / s ) .",
    "( note that some line pairs in the catalog may have line separations less than 20 pixels in terms of the line central wavelength @xmath10 , which is estimated by the 1d gaussian fit and different from the @xmath48 peak location in the line detection process . )",
    "when line separations are smaller than 20 pixels , such as the [ oii]@xmath103727 doublet ( separation of about 220 km / s ) , these lines are treated as a single line in our sample .",
    "as information about nearby lines , we provided @xmath66 in the catalog , which is the distance in wavelength to the next independent line in the spectrum , both in increasing and decreasing wavelength directions .",
    "two numbers are provided for each line candidate in this catalog , to describe the statistics about the number of lines in a galaxy .",
    "@xmath67 is the number of detected emission lines in a galaxy , from an individual observation in which the line candidate was detected . if @xmath68 , this means that the galaxy has multiple lines at different wavelengths .",

    "the stacked spectrum indeed shows an excess at this wavelength .",
