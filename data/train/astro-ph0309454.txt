    "obviously , the shape of the luminosity function is defined by a number of factor which can vary from galaxy to galaxy . of these effects ,",
    "most important should be the effects of binary evolution . despite of a number of population synthesis models developed",
    ", there is no a clear prediction about the evolution of the luminosity distribution of x - ray binaries with time . based on simple arguments",
    ", one might expect that these effects are mostly pronounced at the high luminosity end of the xlf .",
    "indeed , a luminosity of @xmath34 erg / s requires a mass accretion rate of @xmath35 m@xmath36/yr , which can be sustained by a low mass star for less than @xmath37 yrs @xcite .",
    "this value is significantly shorter than the life time of a galaxy .",
    "it is yet shorter for the most luminous lmxb systems with @xmath38 erg / s . in order to have the presently observed shape of the luminosity distribution , with a moderate fraction of sources with @xmath39 erg / s , in the stellar systems of the age of @xmath40 yrs",
    ", a continuous replenishment of the high luminosity sources is required .. ] such replenishment can be maintained for example due to binary systems with initially less massive companion stars , reaching the x - ray active phase at later times .",
    "clearly , evolution of the luminosity function with time must be present and it should be more pronounced at the high luminosity end of xlf .",
    "consequently , no universal luminosity function in the strict sense should be expected , from which the source populations observed in different galaxies are drawn .    however , the results of the present study suggest that there are no significant variations of the shape of the luminosity distribution of low mass x - ray binaries in majority of nearby galaxies  they are broadly consistent with having the same shape",
    ". this fact might be somewhat surprising in the view of the arguments presented above .",
    "an obvious explanation is that the nearby galaxies constituting our sample have similar age of the stellar population , with sufficiently long time passed since the last starburst events . on the other hand",
    ", the departures from the average xlf possibly observed in ngc1553 and ngc1291 ( section [ sec : individual ] ) , if real , might be a manifestation of the xlf dependence on the age and star formation history of the host galaxy .    in interpreting the absence of pronounced systematic variations of the shape of the luminosity distribution",
    ", one should take into consideration the sensitivity limitations of the present analysis .",
    "indeed , in order to minimize contamination by the background sources and interference of the ccd boundaries , we analyzed the central parts of the galaxies , within @xmath2 effective radii for the early type galaxies , and inner bulges for spirals .",
    "this resulted in a rather limited number of sources in our sample , @xmath41 in total , and , consequently , to a limited sensitivity to possible xlf variations .",
    "the amplitude of the statistical uncertainties is illustrated by the shaded area in fig.[fig : xlf_comb_uxlf ] . with",
    "increased sample and detection sensitivity , more complex behavior and more subtle effects can be discovered .",
    "we should note , however , that the analyzed annuli encompass from @xmath42 to @xmath43 of the total near - infrared luminosity ( and stellar mass ) of the galaxies .",
    "typically , more than a half of the remaining stellar mass is contained in the central parts of the galaxies , inside the inner boundary of the analyzed annuli .",
    "on the other hand , for many galaxies the outer boundary was sufficiently close to the maximum value allowed by cxb contribution , especially for the luminosity growth curves .",
    "therefore a significant increase of the number of x - ray binaries suitable for analysis would require an adequate improvement in the sensitivity and an accurate treatment of the incompleteness effects in the centers of the galaxies .    due to typically larger distances to the elliptical galaxies , the low luminosity end of the xlf was studied using the data of only two late type galaxies , m31 and the milky way .",
    "generalization of these results on the galaxies of all morphological types involves certain degree of extrapolation of the data .",
    "on the other hand , the old stellar systems in the ellipticals and spirals are similar in many respects and such an extrapolation might be justified .",
    "as was shown by @xcite , in a very broad range of luminosities , @xmath44 , the luminosity function of hmxbs is consistent , to the first approximation , with a single slope power law with the differential slope of @xmath45 .",
    "the average luminosity function of lmxbs , on the contrary , has a complex shape .",
    "it is a power law with the differential slope of @xmath3 at low luminosities , steepens significantly at @xmath46 and has a cut - off at @xmath47 ( fig.[fig : xrb_xlf ] ) .",
    "different shape of the luminosity functions of the high and low mass binaries reflects , obviously , the difference in the accretion regimes .",
    "the majority of high mass systems are wind accretors .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite , that the expected xlf slope is @xmath48 , i.e. close to the observed value .",
    "note , that postnov s derivation was based on the assumption , that the mass distribution of the donor stars in hmxbs can be described by the salpeter imf .",
    "the low mass systems , on the other hand , are close binaries fed via roche lobe overflow .",
    "the slope of the average lmxb xlf at @xmath49 is qualitatively similar to that obtained by @xcite from x - ray binaries population synthesis , @xmath50 . at lower luminosities ,",
    "however , the population synthesis model predicts significantly more sources than actually observed . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the number of low luminosity sources is substantially reduced , if the irradiation of the donor star by the x - ray emission from the primary is taken into account .",
    "indeed , their illustrative @xmath51 distribution with simplified account of the irradiation effect is significantly flatter below @xmath52 and is qualitatively similar to the observed average xlf of lmxbs .",
    "the different shape of xlfs of hmxbs and lmxbs can be used to diagnose on - going star formation in relatively nearby galaxies ( @xmath53 mpc for the chandra angular resolution ) .",
    "two possibilities can be exploited .",
    "the cut - off in the hmxb luminosity function occurs at @xmath54 times higher luminosity than in lmxbs ( fig.[fig : xrb_xlf ] ) . in our sample of @xmath41 sources in the old stellar systems with total stellar mass of @xmath55 m@xmath56 two brightest sources , in ngc1553 ,",
    "have luminosity @xmath57 and @xmath58 erg / s ( see sections [ sec : nir_x_gcurve ] and [ sec : ngc1553 ] ) .",
    "these two sources excluded , the luminosity of the other sources does not exceed @xmath59 erg / s ( fig.[fig : xlf_cum ] ) .",
    "the brightest high mass x - ray binaries , on the other hand , have luminosities up to @xmath60 erg / s .",
    "detection of even one source with luminosity of the order of @xmath61 erg / s or greater implies that the star formation process is taking place . from the number of such luminous sources the star formation rate can be estimated , as it is directly proportional to the sfr @xcite : @xmath62 where sfr refers to the formation rate of stars more massive than @xmath63m@xmath36 .",
    "this , obviously , can be used for sufficiently high star formation rates , exceeding @xmath54 m@xmath56/yr .",
    "non - detection of luminous sources , on the other hand , immediately constrains the star formation rate , e.g. absence of sources with @xmath64 or @xmath65 erg / s results in upper limit on the star formation rate of sfr@xmath66 and sfr@xmath67 m@xmath36/yr respectively ( 90% confidence level ) .    at lower star formation rates one can use the fact , that the xlf slopes at the low luminosity end are substantially different , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for lmxbs and hmxbs respectively ( fig.[fig : xrb_xlf ] ) .",
    "therefore detection of a population of compact sources with sufficiently steep @xmath70 distribution at @xmath71 erg / s might indicate on - going star formation .",
    "conversely , @xmath72 distribution in the low luminosity limit would indicate that the x - ray emission is dominated by an old stellar population .",
    "relative contributions of low and high mass x - ray binaries to the observed population of compact x - ray sources is defined by the ratio of the stellar mass to the star formation rate . due to different shapes of the luminosity functions ( fig.[fig : xrb_xlf ] )",
    "it also depends on the considered luminosities range .    using the calibrations of @xmath12sfr and @xmath73 relations obtained by @xcite and in the present paper ,",
    "the ratio of the total luminosities can be estimated : @xmath74 in the low sfr limit , sfr@xmath75 m@xmath36/yr , the luminosity of high mass x - ray binaries will be subject to effects of statistics ( section [ sec : stat ] ) and the ratio of the most probable values is given by : @xmath76 the two above dependences intersect at sfr@xmath77 m@xmath36/yr ,    the ratio of the number of sources depends non - monotonically on the threshold luminosity @xmath78 . for the sources brighter than @xmath34 erg /",
    "s it equals to : @xmath79 the coefficient in the above formula is @xmath80 for @xmath81 erg / s respectively .",
    "note , that the last number is based on extrapolation of the luminosity functions beyond the luminosity range covered by data .      given the shape of the lmxb xlf ( fig.[fig : xrb_xlf ] ) , the effects of statistics are not very pronounced in the considered range of the stellar mass , @xmath82 , and do not affect significantly the @xmath73 relation ( thick solid line and shaded area around it in fig.[fig : x_mass ] ) .",
    "they are more noticeable when considering average luminosity of x - ray sources in a galaxy and lead to an artificial ( unphysical ) dependence of the average luminosity on the stellar mass ( fig.[fig : lx2nx_vs_mass ] ) . as illustrated by fig.[fig : lx2nx_vs_mass ] , the observed dependence agrees well with the theoretical prediction based on the shape of the average xlf .",
    "the deviation of x - ray growth curves from the distribution of the near - infrared light observed in the disks of spiral galaxies has been attributed in section [ sec : gcurves_spir ] to the contribution of high mass x - ray binaries . in fig.[fig : xlf_m101 ] we further support this suggestion by comparing the x - ray luminosity functions of the bulge and disk population in m101 .",
    "the observed difference in the number of sources and the shapes of their luminosity distributions agree both qualitatively and quantitatively with that expected from the `` universal '' luminosity functions of high and low mass x - ray binaries . also shown in fig.[fig : xlf_m101 ] is the expected contribution of the low mass x - ray binaries in the disk of m101 , predicted from its near - infrared luminosity and using the x - ray / nir ratio derived for the bulge .",
    "the smallness of the expected number of lmxbs in the disk is in a good agreement with the fact , that outside the bulge of m101 , the sources exhibit strong concentration towards the spiral arms , with the source density in the inter - arm regions being close to the density of background sources @xcite .",
    "the disk of m101 has a rather small ratio of the stellar mass to the star formation rate , @xmath83 yrs .",
    "correspondingly ( section [ sec : l2m_m2sfr ] ) , the lmxb contribution to the disk population of the compact x - ray sources is small and the luminosity function of the disk sources is close to that of hmxbs . in a general case , the population of the compact x - ray sources can be a superposition of the high and low mass x - ray binaries with comparable relative contributions , resulting to a complex shape of the luminosity distribution , coinciding neither with lmxb nor with hmxb xlf .",
    "this might explain a variety of the shapes of the luminosity functions observed by chandra in different regions of nearby late type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as illustrated by right panel of fig.[fig : xlf_m101 ] , showing the luminosity distribution in a large region of m81 , including both bulge and disk population . due to rather large value of the @xmath84 yrs , comparable fractions of low and high mass x - ray binaries are expected .",
    "the total luminosity function of all sources can be presented as a sum of lmxb and hmxb contributions ( fig.[fig : xlf_m101 ] ) , in agreement with different luminosity distributions of the sources near the spiral arms and in the inter - arm regions observed by chandra @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 growth curves of two galaxies , ngc1553 and ngc1291 , show significant deviations from the distribution of the nir light ( fig.[fig : gcurves_lx ] ) .",
    "the luminosity distributions for these two galaxies also exhibit largest deviations from the average xlf , although consistent with the latter within statistical uncertainties , according to the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( table [ tab : ks_test ] ) .",
    "these two galaxies might indeed present an example of the population age dependent variations in the shape of the luminosity distribution . in both cases",
    "the deviations from the average lmxb xlf occur at the high luminosity end as might be expected for such variations .",
    "below we assess the statistical significance of the observed deviations and discuss alternative interpretations .",
    "comparison of @xmath11 and @xmath12 growth curves for this s0 galaxy indicates possible variations of the luminosity distribution with the distance from the nucleus .",
    "this is confirmed by fig.[fig : xlf_ngc1553 ] , presenting luminosity functions for the inner and outer regions . in the inner ring ,",
    "the luminosity distribution of the sources is consistent with that of other early type galaxies ( solid smooth line marked `` lmxb '' ) . in the outer ring , on the contrary , it deviates significantly from the average ( long - dashed line ) , both in the slope of the distribution and in the luminosity of the brightest sources .",
    "although the luminosity function of all sources from @xmath85 is consistent with the average lmxb xlf ( table [ tab : ks_test ] ) , the outer ring taken separately gives the value of the kolmogorov - smirnov probability of @xmath86 .",
    "in particular , 3 sources with @xmath87 erg / s are observed at the radial distance @xmath88 from the nucleus .",
    "although their luminosities are not extreme  still by a factor of @xmath54 below that of the brightest ulxs in star forming galaxies , they nevertheless stand out in our sample .",
    "the nature of these sources is unclear .",
    "they do not coincide with any of the known globular clusters in the galaxy @xcite . at the time of writing",
    ", there were no repeated observations of ngc1553 , therefore their transient nature can not be established .",
    "the shape of the xlf is reminiscent of that observed in the disks of the spiral galaxies ( cf .",
    "fig[fig : xlf_m101 ] ) .",
    "hypothetically it could be understood as a superposition of the lmxb and hmxb populations ( solid line in fig.[fig : xlf_ngc1553 ] ) .",
    "however , such an explanation would require star formation on the level of @xmath89 m@xmath36/yr .",
    "although on - going star formation in ngc1553 can not be entirely excluded ",
    "it forms an interacting pair with ngc1549 @xcite , the required value of sfr exceeds by an order of magnitude the star formation rates detected in some of the s0 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the value of the far - infrared flux observed by iras , @xmath90 and @xmath91 jy ( ned , http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu ) , constrains the present star formation rate in ngc1553 by @xmath92 m@xmath36/yr .",
    "another possibility is that the field of ngc1553 is contaminated by a fluctuation in the density of the cxb sources . an indirect evidence in favor of this interpretation is provided by the detection of another very bright source in the periphery of ngc1553 located at @xmath93 from the nucleus ( the source no.38 in the table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "its luminosity is @xmath94 erg / s assuming that it is a member of galactic population of the compact sources . an optical counterpart has been found in the dss plate @xcite .",
    "the blue magnitude , listed in the usno-2 catalog , @xmath95 , would correspond to the luminosity @xmath96 l@xmath36 if the source was located at the distance of ngc1553 .",
    "obviously , this source is a background agn ( a foreground object in the galaxy is excluded by the @xmath97 ) .",
    "as the expected number of such bright background objects is @xmath98 , its presence might indicate an enhancement in the number density of cxb sources in the filed of ngc1553 .",
    "detection of optical counterparts of other apparently luminous sources would prove this hypothesis , however optical observations inside @xmath99 effective radii of the galaxy are complicated by its optical emission . note , that in order to account for the number of bright sources observed in the outer ring ( fig.[fig : xlf_ngc1553 ] ) , a significant over - density of the cxb sources , by a factor of @xmath100 , on arcmin angular scale is required , which is probably too large to be explained in terms of the average angular correlation function of cxb sources @xcite .    in conclusion , we note , that although ngc1553 clearly stands out in our sample from the point of view of the @xmath12 growth curve and the shape of the luminosity function , its growth curve for the number of sources and x / m@xmath1 ratios are within the dispersion of the values observed in other nearby galaxies ( table [ tab : xray ] , figs.[fig : gcurves_nx ] , [ fig : x_mass ] , [ fig : x2mass_vs_type ] ) .",
    "we give in table [ tab : xray ] the x - ray and near - infrared parameters for both the inner ring and the entire @xmath85 region .",
    "ngc1553 data were not included in constructing the average luminosity function ( fig.[fig : xrb_xlf ] ) and determination of its best fit parameters ( table [ tab : xlf ] ) .",
    "its influence on the shape of the average luminosity function is illustrated in the right panel in fig.[fig : xlf_ngc1553 ] , showing that associated changes are well within the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the deviations of the @xmath12 growth curve from the nir profile are significantly less pronounced and are within about @xmath101 .",
    "the examination of the luminosity distribution in different annuli did not reveal any peculiarities , similar to those observed in ngc1553 .",
    "the overall luminosity distribution ( fig.[fig : xlf_comb_uxlf ] ) agrees very well with the average lmxb xlf at low luminosities , @xmath102 erg / s , but appears to have a too abrupt cut - off above this value . to characterize it quantitatively",
    ", we note that the average xlf , normalized to the total number of sources at the the adopted completeness limit , @xmath103 erg / s , predicts @xmath104 sources above the luminosity of the brightest observed source , @xmath105 erg / s . for a poisson distribution with expectation value of 2.7 ,",
    "the probability to draw zero is 6.7% , i.e. the case of ngc1291 presents @xmath101 deviation .",
    "this value of probability is not small enough to claim presence of statistically significant deviations from the average xlf",
    ".      the luminosity function of lmxb sources in the milky way and x - ray / m@xmath1 ratios are by a factor of @xmath2 lower than the main group of galaxies on all plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xlf_cum ] , [ fig : x_mass ] , [ fig : x2mass_vs_type ] ) . as the x - ray / m@xmath1 ratios for the milky way were derived in a different way than for other galaxies , they are subject to different systematic uncertainties .",
    "we discuss below various factors , affecting its x - ray / nir ratios .",
    "the stellar mass of the milky way was estimated using the k - band growth curve and mass - to - light ratio of m31 , which is sufficiently similar to our galaxy in the morphological type . in the growth curve analysis we used the low mass x - ray binaries located at @xmath106 , where the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is located at the galactic center and the x - axis",
    "is directed towards the sun @xcite .",
    "thus , to the accuracy defined by the completeness of the lmxb catalog , our analysis should include @xmath107 of the galaxy .",
    "correspondingly , the nir growth curve of m31 was scaled down by a factor of 2 , resulting in the k - band luminosity of the half of the galaxy @xmath108 l@xmath36 ( calculated from the best fit total k - band magnitude of m31 , @xmath109 , table [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "this value is consistent with accuracy better than @xmath110 with that expected from the the total k - band luminosity of the milky way , @xmath111 l@xmath36 , obtained from 3d modeling of the dirbe data @xcite .",
    "the k - band mass - to - light ratio obtained from the optical color of m31 is @xmath112 .",
    "this value is close , but not identical to the value obtained by @xcite for the solar neighborhood , @xmath113 .",
    "it should be mentioned , though , that the latter value was derived for the disk population of the galaxy and might not be appropriate for the older stellar population of the bulge .",
    "note , that higher mass - to - light ratio would increase the stellar mass estimate , decrease of the x - ray / mass ratio , and therefore would result in a larger discrepancy between the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "an important factor is the completeness of the lmxbs catalog .",
    "@xcite used the sources with known distances and reliable optical identification . comparing with the stellar mass distribution in the galaxy",
    ", they concluded , that their sample is reasonably complete above @xmath114 erg / s and within @xmath115 kpc from the sun . in computing the final luminosity function and total x - ray luminosity of the galaxy they introduced luminosity dependent volume correction using the mass model of the galaxy . on the other hand we computed the x - ray / nir ratios using the sources located at @xmath106 in the range of projected galactocentric distances @xmath116 , which , strictly speaking , is not identical to the definition of the completeness region in @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , whether this procedure could result in an underestimate of the milky way luminosity by a factor of @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of the x - ray - to - mass ratio , derived in this paper , @xmath117 erg / s/@xmath118 is close but somewhat lower than the one obtained by @xcite , using different method , @xmath119 erg / s/@xmath118 .",
    "finally , @xcite used the source luminosities averaged over 5 year period of the asm / rxte observations .",
    "depending on the properties of the collective x - ray light curve of the galaxy this might lead to a difference between their average value and the value to be most probably observed in a snapshot .",
    "the calibration of the @xmath120sfr and @xmath73 relations obtained by @xcite and in the present paper allows us to estimate the total energy output of x - ray binaries throughout the life time of a galaxy .",
    "the total energy output of hmxbs in the chandra passband can be estimated as : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the time dependent star formation rate of stars more massive than 5 m@xmath36 and describes the star formation history of the galaxy , @xmath118  its present stellar mass , @xmath123  fraction of the total mass of stars formed during the life time of the galaxy , which presently resides in stars ( of all masses ) , @xmath124 is the imf - dependent mass fraction of stars more massive than 5 m@xmath36 and accounts for the fact , that @xmath12sfr was calibrated for formation rate of stars @xmath125 m@xmath36 : @xmath126 for the `` extended '' miller - scalo imf @xcite , @xmath127 for @xmath128 , and @xmath129 for @xmath130 , @xmath131 .    studying the intermediate redshift ( up to @xmath132 ) starburst galaxies observed by chandra in the hubble deep field north @xcite showed that the calibration of the @xmath133sfr ratio based on the local galaxies is valid for these distant galaxies as well . for this reason the @xmath133sfr ratio can be taken outside the integration in eq.([eq : e_hmxb ] ) with @xmath134 erg / s per m@xmath36/yr and assuming @xmath135 , the total energy output of hmxbs is @xmath136    the energy output of lmxbs is : @xmath137 unlike for high mass x - ray binaries , eq.([eq : e_hmxb ] ) , the @xmath12mass relations was measured for nearby galaxies only .",
    "therefore the last equality in the above equation relies on the extrapolation of this relation to high redshifts . as the evolution effects might play an important role in the case of lmxbs , this estimate is significantly less robust than that for hmxbs .",
    "however , the details of the evolution of the luminosity distribution of lmxbs are yet unexplored , and even a crude estimate might be of certain interest . using @xmath138 erg / s per @xmath7 m@xmath36 and assuming @xmath139 yrs : @xmath140 which is close to the value obtained for hmxbs . as low mass x - ray binaries were brighter in the past , this number is a lower limit on their energy output in the chandra passband .      for the typical value of the stellar mass in the rich clusters of galaxies , @xmath141 m@xmath36 ,",
    "the expected x - ray luminosity of low mass x - ray binaries is @xmath142 erg / s .",
    "taken at face value , this is a negligible fraction , at the level of @xmath143 few per cent , of the luminosity of the x - ray emitting gas , @xmath144 erg / s .",
    "however , due to different energy spectra of x - ray gas and of x - ray binaries , contribution of the latter might become significant in certain energy ranges .",
    "it is well known that the hard tails of comptonized radiation might be present in the spectra of x - ray binaries .",
    "depending on the spectral state , the spectrum of the comptonized component extends to @xmath145 kev ( low state ) or to the @xmath146 mev energies in the high state of black hole binaries .",
    "importantly , in the low state , the hard spectral component is observed in the spectra of both black hole and neutron star binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hard x - ray spectral component might amplify the relative contribution of x - ray binaries at high x - ray energies , @xmath147 kev and higher .",
    "an accurate calculation of this contribution would require knowledge of the x - ray binaries luminosity distribution in hard x - rays , far beyond the chandra bandpass . for a crude ,",
    "an order of magnitude estimate we note , that in the low spectral state , corresponding to the luminosities below @xmath148 erg / s , the luminosity above @xmath149 kev is at the very least equal to that emitted in the chandra bandpass . given the shape of the lmxb luminosity function , the sources with @xmath150 erg / s contribute @xmath28 to the combined x - ray luminosity of lmxbs .",
    "thus , only due to x - ray binaries in the low spectral state the luminosity above @xmath151 kev should be of the order of @xmath152 erg / s .",
    "this is , obviously , a lower limit to the actual value of the total hard x - ray luminosity due to lmxbs . on the other hand , for typical temperatures of the x - ray gas in the clusters of galaxies , @xmath153 kev , of the order of @xmath154 of the total luminosity",
    "is emitted above @xmath151 kev , i.e. @xmath155 erg / s which is comparable to the lower limit on the luminosity of lmxbs . at higher energies",
    "the situation becomes even more favorable for lmxbs . as the emissivity of x - ray gas falls off with radius quicker , than the number density of the galaxies ,",
    "the relative contribution of lmxbs in hard x - ray energy domain will be further enhanced in the outer parts of the clusters .",
    "we should note , however , that the hard x - ray emission may be dominated by the low luminosity agns , depending on their actual frequency and the luminosity distribution .",
    "we analyzed population properties of compact x - ray sources in nearby external galaxies of various morphological types and of the lmxb sources in the milky way .",
    "we focused our analysis on the old stellar systems  early type galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies .",
    "this ensures that the compact x - ray sources in the external galaxies are dominated by low mass x - ray binaries . in the case of the milky way we explicitly selected lmxb sources based on the results of @xcite .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows .    1 .   for all galaxies the azimuthally averaged spatial distribution of the number of lmxbs follows closely the distribution of the near - infrared light ( fig.[fig : gcurves_nx ] ) .",
    "our analysis covered the central parts of the galaxies , out to @xmath2 effective radii in early type galaxies and @xmath156inside the inner bulge in spiral galaxies . with the exception of ngc1553 and , to lesser",
    "extend , ngc1291 ( section [ sec : individual ] ) , the same is true for the distribution of their combined luminosity in the chandra bandpass , @xmath157 kev ( fig.[fig : gcurves_lx ] ) .",
    "+ in the disks of spiral galaxies , on the contrary , the distribution of the number and combined luminosity of the compact sources deviates significantly from the nir profile .",
    "the deviation is caused by the contribution of hmxbs , as evidenced by the example of the milky way ( fig.[fig : gcurves_mw ] ) and by the comparison of the luminosity functions of the disk and bulge in m101 and m81 ( fig.[fig : xlf_m101 ] ) .",
    "considering galaxies as whole , the total number of lmxbs and their collective luminosity are directly proportional to the stellar mass of the host galaxy ( fig.[fig : x_mass ] ) , the latter calculated from the k - band luminosity using color - based correction of the mass - to - light ratio ( eq.([eq : m2l ] ) ) .",
    "+ there is statistically significant dispersion between values of x / m@xmath1 ratios , with the fractional rms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath20 and @xmath19 respectively ( fig.[fig : x2mass_vs_type ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of the color - based correction of the k - band mass - to - light ratio in the present analysis is insufficient to establish reality of the observed dispersion .",

    "<S> we use @xmath15 minimization , which is strictly applicable in the limit of a large number of sources per galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this is correct for most of the galaxies from our sample ( table [ tab : xray ] ) , therefore we do not expect any significant bias in the best - fit slope . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit values of the slope are consistent with unity : @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the luminosity and the number of sources respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore fix the slopes at @xmath18 and consider average @xmath19 and @xmath20 ratios . to estimate these we use the unweighted average @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> this discrepancy is due to difference between the expectation values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the presence of systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic errors are present in both @xmath23 , due to transformation to the same @xmath24 based on the average xlf , and in @xmath25 , as they are derived from near - infrared luminosity using an average color - based correction to mass - to - light ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we are dealing with rather small samples ( e.g. 4 galaxies of late morphological type ) also plays a role . for the same reason , yet different values would be obtained if one used weighted estimates for @xmath26 , e.g. @xmath15 minimization technique . </S>",
    "<S> these factors should be taken into consideration when comparing the @xmath27 ratios .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig.[fig : x2mass_vs_type ] the @xmath19 and @xmath20 ratios for individual galaxies as a function of the morphological type . </S>",

    "<S> a larger dispersion for @xmath19 can probably be explained by the larger correction factors for the number of sources and , respectively , the stronger dependence of the correction factors on the details of the individual xlfs .      </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : x2mass_vs_type ] and table [ tab : x2mass ] indicate a possible dependence of the @xmath20 ratio on the morphological type . </S>",
    "<S> this can be in part caused by the statistical effects ( section [ sec : stat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the bulges of spiral galaxies have smaller mass than early type galaxies , consequently , smaller numbers of luminous lmxb sources and , therefore , are more subject to the effects of statistics . that these effects can contribute to the observed trend </S>",
    "<S> is demonstrated by the last column in table [ tab : x2mass ] where average @xmath20 ratios , corrected for the statistical effects , are listed . an additional argument in favor of this explanation is that a similar trend is not observed for the @xmath19 , ratio ( fig.[fig : x2mass_vs_type ] , table [ tab : x2mass ] ) . on the other hand , the @xmath19 ratios are more sensitive to the details of the individual luminosity functions and therefore are less robust .    </S>",
    "<S> another factor might be insufficiently accurate calibration of the near - infrared mass - to - light ratios . as discussed in section [ sec : nir_mass ] , the color - based correction was obtained under the assumption of the universal initial mass function and might fail , if the morphological type dependent variations in the imf are present @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such variations can not be excluded a priori , given the broad range of morphological types in our sample . yet </S>",
    "<S> another source of uncertainty is that in computing the @xmath31 ratios integrated colors of the galaxies were used . </S>",
    "<S> as the galaxies do show color gradients @xcite , whose amplitude is type dependent and is largest for late types , @xmath32 , this introduces additional uncertainty in the relative values of the @xmath31 ratio derived for early and late type galaxies .    to conclude , due to a number of uncertain factors involved , the possibility of a weak dependence of the x - ray / mass ratios on the morphological type can be neither rejected nor confirmed with sufficient confidence . however , </S>",
    "<S> if present , it does not exceed a factor of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the x - ray/@xmath33 ratios do show clear dependence on the morphological type ( fig.[fig : lx2lnir_vs_type ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is obviously caused by dependence of the near - infrared mass - to - light ratio on the morphological type of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation of the x - ray to optical light ratios with the morphological type should be significantly more pronounces at shorter wavelength , e.g. in the b - band , due to significantly stronger type dependent variations of the mass - to - light ratio in the optical band @xcite . </S>"
