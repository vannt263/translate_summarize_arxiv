    "the resonant @xmath0 formation , first observed by dzhelepov and co - workers  @xcite , is a  key process of muon catalyzed fusion ( @xmath7cf ) in deuterium ( see e.g.  reviews  @xcite ) . a  muonic deuterium atom @xmath1 is created when a  negative muon  @xmath8 is captured into an atomic orbital in a  deuterium target .",
    "after @xmath1 deexcitation to the @xmath9 state and slowing down , the @xmath0 molecule can be formed in @xmath1 atom collision with one of the d@xmath2 target molecules .",
