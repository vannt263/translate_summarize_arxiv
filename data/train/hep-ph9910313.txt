    "qcd at high density and low temperature is a color superconductor @xcite-@xcite characterized by the formation of a diquark condensate in the attractive @xmath5 color channel .",
    "the condensation is analogous to cooper pairing in ordinary superfluids or superconductors , and occurs even via arbitrarily weak attractive interactions due to the presence of a fermi surface @xcite .",
    "recently it was discovered @xcite that long range magnetic fluctuations enhance the condensation , leading to a gap which behaves as [ lp ] ~g^-5 ( - 3 ^2 g )   in the weak coupling ( small g , or large @xmath6 ) limit . in this limit ( [ lp ] )",
    "is the gauge invariant , leading order result of a systematic expansion in powers of g. the properties of the condensate are easy to determine in the case of two quark flavors .",
    "because the condensate occurs between pairs of either left ( ll ) or right ( rr ) handed quarks in the j = l = s=0 channel @xcite , and the @xmath5 color channel is antisymmetric , the quarks must pair in the isospin singlet ( ud - du ) flavor channel .",
    "however , even in this case there is a subtlety , as the relative color orientations of the ll and rr condensates are not determined by the usual leading order analysis .",
    "a misalignment of these condensates violates parity , and further breaks the gauge group beyond @xmath7 . as we will discuss below , an analysis of the meissner effect",
    "is necessary to determine the relative orientation .",
    "there are thus a number of unstable configurations of only slightly higher energy with different color - flavor orientations ( and hence different symmetry breaking patterns ) , leading to the possibility of disorienting the diquark condensate .",
    "we include a discussion of possible phenomenological signals associated with these phenomena .",
    "the generalization to three flavors is far from straightforward .",
    "again , one can show that the condensate must occur in the j = l = s=0 and color @xmath5 channel .",
    "the pauli principle then requires that the flavor structure again be antisymmetric @xmath8 , for quarks of flavor @xmath9 .",
    "thus , one can have combinations of condensates which are in the @xmath5 of both color and flavor @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "due to the chirality preserving nature of perturbative gluon exchange , there is no mixing of ll and rr condensates , which form independently .",
    "one can immediately see that there are a number of possibilities .",
    "for example , the condensates for the three flavors and both chiralities might all align in color space , leading to an @xmath7 breaking pattern .",
    "a more complicated condensate has been proposed @xcite called color flavor locking ( cfl ) , in which the @xmath5 color orientations are `` locked '' to the @xmath5 flavor orientation .    in this paper",
    "we determine the nature of the energy surface governing the various color - flavor orientations of the condensate .",
    "let us begin by characterizing the color - flavor configuration space of condensates .",
    "we consider the anstz [ ansatz ] ^ab_ij  ^l , r  =   a^c_k  ^l , r   ^abc _ ijk  , where a , b are color and i , j flavor indices .",
    "l and r denote pairing between pairs of left and right handed quarks , respectively . under color and flavor a transforms as [ atrans ] a^l u_c a^l v^l  , where @xmath12 is an element of @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath15 .",
    "a similar equation holds for @xmath16 .",
    "it is always possible to diagonalize @xmath17 by appropriate choice of @xmath12 and @xmath18 : [ ansatz1 ] a^l  =   (    ccc a & 0 & 0 + 0 & b & 0 + 0 & 0 & c    )  .",
    "generically , there does not exist a @xmath19 which diagonalizes @xmath16 in this basis . in the cfl case , where the diagonalized @xmath17 is proportional to the identity , @xmath20 , it is easy to show that one can choose @xmath19 such that @xmath21 .",
    "these two configurations are related by a @xmath22 rotation ( see section 3 ) .",
    "hence , they are degenerate in the high density limit where gluon exchange dominates .",
    "instanton effects , important at intermediate density , favor @xmath23 .",
    "note that parity , if unbroken , requires @xmath24 , and hence implies simultaneous diagonalizability .    in what follows we consider the potential vacua parametrized by a , b , c .",
    "first , we use the dyson - schwinger ( gap ) equation to determine which of these configurations are energy extrema .",
    "next , we compute the energies of the extrema to determine the true groundstate . a similar analysis has been carried out by schfer and wilczek @xcite in the approximation where gluon interactions are replaced by local four fermion interactions .",
    "they concluded that the cfl vacuum had the lowest energy . here , we include the gluons in the analysis , introducing long range color - magnetic fluctuations ( controlled by landau damping ) and meissner screening into the gap equation and vacuum energy calculations .",
    "we find that the cfl vacua remains the lowest energy state , at least at asymptotically high densities where the calculation is reliable .",
    "the meissner effect is a small correction to the vacuum energy at asymptotic densities . at lower densities where the gauge coupling is large",
    "the meissner terms become more important and tend to disfavor cfl relative to the absence of a condensate",
    ". we do not know whether they are ever sufficient to remove the superconducting phase but they will lower the energy difference between the vacuum and unstable condensates with different color and flavor breaking patterns . configurations which satisfy the gap equations but are not the global minimum of energy are presumably saddlepoints , since they are continuously connected to the cfl vacuum via color and flavor rotations .",
    "in this section we determine the subset of parameter space for which our anstz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) satisfies the gap equation . because the gap equation results from the extremization of the effective action , its solutions are energy extrema . at asymptoticaly high densities ( weak coupling ) the diagrams ( a)-(c ) in figure 1 give the leading approximation to the effective action .",
    "note that in these diagrams the quark propagators include the diquark condensate ( see ( [ si ] ) below ) , and the gluon propagators include landau damping , but _ not _ the meissner effect .",
    "the latter arises from the condensate - dependence of quark loops in diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the resulting gap equation ( figure 2 , with condensate shown explicitly at lowest order in @xmath25 ) is given by s^-1(q ) - s^-1_0 ( q )  =   i g^2  ^a _  s(k )   ^b _  d^_ab ( k - q )  , where [ g ] ^a _  =   (    cc _ t^a & 0 + 0 & c ( _ t^a)^t c^-1    )  .",
    "@xmath26 is the gluon propagator , include the effects of landau damping and debye screening ( we assume feynman gauge throughout ) : [ d ] d^  =  1q^2 + g p_t^  +   1q^2 + f p_l^  , where @xmath27 are transverse and longitudinal projectors .",
    "the analytic forms of f and g are given below in ( [ fg ] ) .",
    "the small @xmath28 expansion of g leads to the landau damped magnetic gluon propagator [ ldd ] d_t^ ( q_0 , q )  =   p_t^ q^2 + i m_d^2  , while the expansion of f leads to the usual longitudinal propagator , with debye screening : @xmath29 .",
    "we will restrict the color group structure in the gap equation to the attractive anti - symmetric @xmath5 channel : t^a_ab t^a_cd    1 3 ( _ ac _ bd - _ ab _ cd )  , which projects out the anti - symmetric part of @xmath30 in color space in the gap equation . here",

    "cm    =3 cm    for the three flavor case @xmath31 can be written explicitly as an @xmath35 matrix in color flavor space .",
    "the inverse propagator may be written [ si ] s^-1(q ) = (    cc q/ + / & _ 0 ^_0 + & q/ - /    ) where @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath25 is a @xmath37 matrix which for the anstz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) takes the form [ cond ] = (    ccccccccc 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c & 0 & 0 & 0 & b + 0 & 0 & 0 & -c & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -b & 0 & 0 + 0 & -c & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + c & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & a + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -a & 0 + 0 & 0 & -b & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -a & 0 & 0 & 0 + b & 0 & 0 & 0 & a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0    ) because we are dealing with a diquark condensate the non - trivial part of the gap equation involves the lower left @xmath37 block",
    ". we will refer to this sub - block of the propagator @xmath31 as @xmath38 .    for a particular anstz @xmath25 to be a solution to the gap equation we require that the color antisymmetric part of @xmath39 ( corresponding to the @xmath5 channel ) be proportional in color - flavor space to @xmath40 , which appears on the lhs of the gap equation .",
    "this requires some justification , as the matrices that appear on the rhs of the gap equation appear inside the integral .",
    "if , for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to anstze which correspond to constant color - flavor matrices times a function of momenta , then this condition is implied . in principle , there can be more exotic solutions in which color and flavor orientations rotate in momentum space , however it seems unlikely that such solutions exist .",
    "we note that the equality must hold for all values of the external momentum q , and that the set of functions @xmath41 are likely to form a complete basis for functions of k , since they are essentially smeared delta functions of ( k - q ) .",
    "thus by taking appropriate linear combinations of the gap equation we can see that @xmath39 must be proportional to @xmath25 when integrated against any arbitary function of k. hence the proportionality must hold without the integral .    the propagator may be found by inverting the sparse matrix in ( [ si ] ) using mathematica .",
    "only three anstze satisfy our condition : @xmath20 ; @xmath42 ; @xmath43 .",
    "we refer to these solutions as ( 111 ) ( color - flavor locking ) , ( 110 ) ( @xmath44 breaking ) and ( 100 ) ( @xmath45 breaking ) respectively .    for these anstze",

    "we neglect @xmath50 , as compared to @xmath51 , as well as anti - particle contributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for details ) .",
    "we obtain    @xmath52    where @xmath53 , \\label{fg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath54 is one of the gap kernels from ( [ kernels ] ) .",
    "these gap equations can be solved numerically .",
    "we first present solutions neglecting the meissner effect .",
    "the results for @xmath25 vs @xmath55 are displayed in figures 3 and 4 for the three anstze .",
    "( the spatial momentum @xmath56 is taken to lie on the fermi surface . )",
    "the curves lie very close to each other but as we will see below give quite different contributions to the vacuum energy .",
    "note that the gap solutions we obtain have broad support , from the fermi surface to @xmath57 .",
    "however , this is likely a consequence of the approximations used in ( [ finalgap ] ) , in which all momenta are assumed to lie close to the fermi surface .",
    "= 12 cm    = 12 cm    a complete analysis must also include the meissner effect , that is the screening of the gluons induced by the formation of the gap .",
    "the leading order contribution to the gluon vacuum polarization @xmath58 comes from the off - diagonal terms in the fermion propagator - matrix [ p ] p_(q_0,q )  =   g^2  . where we have dropped the group theory factors .",
    "it is convenient to use the formalism of @xcite which exploits simplifications due to decomposition of the fermion propagator into a sum of projections onto different chirality and helicity channels .",
    "after some tedious algebra one gets for ( [ p ] ) p_ij(q_0,q )  =   2 g^2 ||^2 k_0 ^ 2 + ( k)^2 g_ij + 12 ( _ i _ j + _ j _",

    "it is easier to compute the contribution to the magnetic gluon mass @xmath61 directly applying the transverse projector @xmath62 to the gluon vacuum polarization while using the hdl approximation ( the momentum in the loop @xmath63 and is much bigger than the momentum transfer @xmath64 ) @xcite : g(q_0 , q )  =   1 2 p^t_ij p_ij(q_0,q )  =   g^2 ||^2 k_0 ^ 2 + ( k)^2 1 + ( k_0 - q_0)^2 + ( k - q)^2  .",
    "further simplification comes after switching on a small temperature and performing a summation over frequencies @xcite .",
    "note that , because the system is already decomposed into particles and anti - particles about the fermi surface , one should apply the summation formulae as if @xmath65 .",
    "finally , one finds [ self ] g(q_0 , q )  =   2 g^2 ||^2 ( 2 ) ^3  .",
    "one can see , either by analytical approximation or numerical evaluation , that @xmath66 is of order @xmath67 for @xmath68 , and falls off like @xmath69 or @xmath70 as either become large @xcite .",
    "while this is of the same order as landau damping , numerical evaluation shows that the meissner contribution is somewhat smaller .    as we are only interested in the size of the contribution of the meissner effect , we use the following approximation , which is an overestimate of the effect : g(q_0,q ) m_d^2 _ 0   , where @xmath71 is the maximum value of the function @xmath72 .",
    "the gap equations were numerically solved for all three gap kernels , and the results are shown in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] . the effect is to decrease the size of the condensate but it is a small perturbation on the solutions obtained previously .",
    "= 12 cm    = 12 cm",
    "to determine which of the above gaps is the true minimum energy state we must calculate the vacuum energy , which receives contributions from vacuum to vacuum loops of both quarks and gluons ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we use the cjt effective potential , which is a function of condensates @xcite : [ cjt ] v(s , d )  & = &   -i  +   i2 +  & + &   where for convenience we suppress appropriate color , flavor and dirac indices . @xmath73 and",
    "@xmath31 correspond to bare and full fermion propagators , @xmath74 and @xmath75 to bare and full gluon propagators and @xmath76 to full vertices .",
    "the ellipsis denote gluon self - interaction loops and terms which are higher order in g. in our approximation , which is essentially hartree - fock ( lowest order in coupling ) , the @xmath76 s become bare vertices .",
    "extremizing with respect to appropriate propagators and vertices one obtains a set of gap equations .",
    "the fermion gap equation is the one we studied in the previous section , while the gluon gap equation produces landau damping .",
    "we wish to compare values of @xmath77 corresponding to our three solutions to determine which one is the true vacuum will be gauge invariant , whereas actual values are not . ] .",
    "it is easy to show that the value of the effective potential evaluated on the gap solution @xmath78 in the hartree - fock approximation is given by : [ cjtg ] v(s^*,d^ * )  =   -i s(p)/s_0(p )  .",
    "diagramatically , this is equivalent to the graph of figure 1(a ) when evaluated on the gap solution .",
    "the fermion loops are most easily calculated by going to a basis where @xmath79 is diagonal in color - flavor space .",
    "note that the gap matrix @xmath25 has non - trivial dirac structure that must be accounted for @xcite : = _ 1 _ 5 p_+  +   _ 2 _ 5 p_-  , where @xmath80 are particle and anti - particle projectors .",
    "our analysis has been restricted to the particle gap function @xmath81 .",
    "the anti - particle gap function @xmath82 has its support near @xmath83 , and its contribution to the vacuum energy is suppressed .",
    "there are 18 eigenvalues , which occur in 9 pairs .",
    "the product of each pair is of the form - ( 1  +   a ^2 ( k_o , k ) k_0 ^ 2  +   ( || - ) ^2 )  , where a is an integer . for our three cases",
    "we obtain the following sets of eigenvalues : ( 111 )   & &   8 \\ { a=1 }  ,   1 \\{a = 4 } + ( 110 )   & &   4 \\ { a=1 }  ,   2 \\ { a = 2 } + ( 100 )   & &   4 \\ { a=1 }",
    "the binding energy is of order @xmath84 \\\\ & \\sim & - a ~\\mu^2 \\delta_0 ^ 2 ~~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the maximum value of the gap function @xmath85 , which has rather broad support in both energy and momentum space away from the fermi surface , extending to @xmath86 .",
    "a more precise answer than ( [ equark ] ) requires numerical evaluation , but it is clear that the result scales with a and has only a weak ( logarithmic ) dependence on the variations in the shape of @xmath85 . substituting our numerical results for the gaps in the three cases , it is easy to establish that e(111 )  <   e(110 )  <   e(100 )  .",
    "the contribution we just computed to @xmath95 still can not differentiate between relative color rotations between the ll and rr diquark condensates .",
    "this is because the energy @xmath95 depends on the sums of the squares of the gauge boson masses induced . in order to be sensitive to lr coupling effects ,",
    "it is necessary that both ll and rr contributions to @xmath58 appear simultaneously in the vacuum energy contribution .",
    "the first such graph is that of figure 1(d ) , and it is of the form e_g^lr ~dk_0 dk   k^2   .",
    "this integral is dominated by the region @xmath96 , leading to the result e_g^lr  ~   m_d^2 _ 0 ^ 2  ~   g^2 ^2 _ 0 ^ 2  .",
    "this effect is further suppressed by a power of the coupling constant .",
    "we see that in the weak coupling limit the vacuum energy required to disorient the ll and rr condensates in color space is rather small .",
    "this suggests that even at asymptotic densities in the two flavor case it might be possible to disorient the diquark condensates from their lowest energy configuration .",
    "we have yet to determine what this lowest energy configuration is , and hence whether parity is violated in the two flavor case . in principle",
    ", one should minimize @xmath97 as a function of the relative ll and rr color orientation .",
    "instead , we will give a simple argument that the condensates prefer to align .",
    "we noted in the last section that including the meissner screening in the gluon propagator leads to a decrease in the gap size .",
    "this is a small effect at weak coupling , and was negligible compared to the color - flavor structure of the quark propagator .",
    "however , in determining ll - rr alignment it is the main effect . in the two flavor case none of the gluons",
    "responsible for the attractive interaction are meissner screened , as long as the ll and rr condensates align . that is the quarks which condense",
    "are those that transform under the unbroken su(2 ) subgroup of @xmath98 .",
    "however , any misalignment leads to the ll condensate screening the rr channel and vice versa , decreasing the condensates and thereby increasing the energy .",
    "hence in the two flavor case the condensates prefer to align and parity is preserved . in the three flavor case cfl",
    "gives all of the gauge bosons a mass and this effect is absent .",
    "in both the two and three flavor cases there remains the possibility of parity violation through a phase associated with the @xmath22 symmetry @xcite .",
    "only instanton effects ( highly suppressed at asymptotic densities ) can distinguish these vacua . at lower densities",
    "instanton effects are expected to strongly break the @xmath22 symmetry , since the @xmath99 mass is dominated by these effects at zero density .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the possible ground states of qcd at asymptotic densities .",
    "we verified that in the two flavor case , the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath7 , while in the three flavor case , color flavor locking has the lowest vacuum energy . in neither case",
    "is parity spontaneously violated until the density is strictly infinite @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the energy surface governing color superconductivity suggests possible experimental signatures in heavy ion collisions . in particular the existence of relatively flat directions along which color and flavor symmetry breaking patterns change raises the possibility of domains of disoriented condensates , each with distinct hadronization properties . in the two flavor case",
    "the ll and rr condensates , each of which break @xmath100 , are only aligned by a subleading term in the vacuum energy calculation . in a heavy ion collision",
    "we might expect the condensates to be misaligned by an arbitrary @xmath98 transformation , leading to violation of parity and complete breaking of the color group . in the three flavor case",
    "we might expect much the same . here",
    "the gauge loop contributions to the vacuum energy from gluon loops will tend to reduce the energy difference between the cfl and , for example , the ( 1,0,0 ) condensates as discussed above .",
    "the strange quark mass also tends to reduce the energy gap between these two condensates as discussed in @xcite .",
    "for some ( uncalculable ) value of @xmath101 of order @xmath102 we expect a phase transition between these two condensates as the number of light flavors changes from 3 to 2 .",
    "thus for realistic values of @xmath101 , and densities and temperatures achievable in heavy ion collisions , we might expect disoriented condensates to form with a range of possible color symmetry breaking patterns appearing on a collision by collision basis .    to see how such variation in color symmetry breaking might be seen in an experiment",
    "we consider the extreme case where the @xmath103 subgroup is left unbroken ( this is the true vacuum of the two flavor theory ) .",
    "consider a region which in the wake of a heavy ion collision volume is sufficiently cool and dense to allow the formation of a diquark condensate , with gauge symmetry broken to @xmath103 .",
    "the region presumably expands and cool in the usual fashion .",
    "however , one color of quark ( e.g. red ) does not participate in the condensation and its propagator is unaffected by @xmath25 .",
    "it is also more weakly interacting since its color corresponds to precisely the broken part of the gauge group ( gluons which couple to red quarks are screened by the meissner effect ) .",
    "the remaining two colors of quarks participate in cooper pairing and interact strongly with the plasma , so they do not disperse as quickly .",
    "the red quarks will therefore tend to flow to the surface of the fireball , providing a mechanism for macroscopic transport of color charge .",
    "note that the condensate is stable under this charge separation since it is the condensate favored by an @xmath103 theory with two flavors .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath98 broken to @xmath103 there is no restoring force which prevents this charge polarization . on leaving the superconducting volume red quarks will suddenly be required to hadronize because their color charge can now support long range fields and they become aware of the large value of the other two color charges in the center .",
    "we expect that this color polarized fireball will hadronize very differently than a quark gluon plasma which is locally color neutral",
    ". naively one expects quark anti - quark production on the boundary of the color charge separation in order to enforce charge neutrality .",
    "the separated red charge would then emerge as energetic hadrons , leaving a cooler central region behind .",
    "the scenario described above is the extreme case of a fully unbroken @xmath103 subgroup . on the other hand a cfl state",
    "treats all colors equally and there will be no charge polarization . on an event by event basis we expect variation between these two extremes .",
    "the most likely signal of such events is a departure from the standard thermal distribution so far observed in heavy ion collisions @xcite , both on an event by event basis and averaged over many events .",
