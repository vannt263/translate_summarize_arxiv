    "<S> in recent years the charmonium production has been studied in various processes , such as in hadron - hadron collision , electron - proton collision , fixed target experiments , @xmath20 meson decays , as well as @xmath21 decays . among them , the study of charmonium production in @xmath16 annihilation is particularly interesting in testing the quarkonium production mechanisms , the color - singlet model and the color - octet model in the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite approach . </S>",
    "<S> this is not only because of the simpler parton structure involved in this process , which may be helpful in reducing the theoretical uncertainty , but also because of the spectacular experimental prospect opened up by the two @xmath20 factories with babar and belle , which will allow a fine data analysis for charmonium production with more than @xmath22 @xmath16 annihilation events in the continuum at @xmath3=10.6 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the belle collaboration has reported the observation of prompt @xmath23 via double @xmath24 production from the @xmath25 continuum@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for these results , not only the large cross section ( @xmath260.9 pb ) of the inclusive @xmath23 production due to the double @xmath24 is puzzling@xcite , but also the exclusive production rate of @xmath14 , @xmath27pb , may not be consistent with two previous calculations@xcite , which gave a cross section of a few pb for @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , recent perturbative qcd estimates of the @xmath15 cross section are only about 0.1 @xmath29 0.2 pb@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the color - singlet channel is dominant since all color - octet channels are of high order of @xmath38 , which is the relative velocity of the charm quark and anti - charm quark in the charmonium , and therefore suppressed relative to the color - singlet channel ( the relative suppression is at least of order @xmath39 for the cross sections ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in order to compare exclusive production with inclusive production rates associated with the @xmath40 charmonium states , we will calculate the cross section @xmath41 , and hope these ratios will be useful for both inclusive and exclusive production analyses at @xmath3=10.6 gev .    </S>",

    "<S> therefore we intend to conclude , as in @xcite , that it seems hard to explain the double charm production data observed by belle based on perturbative qcd ( including both color - singlet and color - octet channels ) , and possible nonperturbative qcd effects should be considered at @xmath105 .    while we were about to submit our result </S>",
    "<S> , there appeared one paper which also considered exclusive double - charmonium production@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> those authors took the qed effects into account in addition to the qcd effects that we considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find our result for the exclusive double - charmonium production is consistent with theirs but we also analyzed some inclusive processes which were not discussed in ref .  </S>",
