    "the thin film sro113 is of particular interest as a widely - used bottom electrode @xcite and is intensively studied for the possibility of a new field - effect device @xcite .",
    "considering their fundamental and technological importance , it is essential to understand correctly the electronic structures of sro214 and sro113 . for sro214",
    ", the early electronic structure calculations @xcite showed that the states near the fermi level ( @xmath11 ) consist of antibonding combinations of ru-@xmath12 and o-2@xmath13 , and the fermi surface is composed of the @xmath14-centered electron - like sheets ( called as @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and the x - point - centered hole - like sheet ( called as @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "the lda ( local density approximation ) fermi surface topology was in good agreement with that of de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) experiments @xcite , but does not seem to be with the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite in the sense that one electron - like ( @xmath15 ) and two hole - like ( @xmath17 and @xmath16 ) fermi surface were observed by arpes @xcite .",
    "it however turns out to be a surface effect @xcite later .",
    "therefore the overall features of the electronic structure can be regarded as being described well by the conventional electronic structure calculation techniques such as lda and gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) .",
    "however the details of the electronic structure are still not clearly understood .",
    "a series of recent studies that identify sro214 as a ` hund s metal ' @xcite can be one example showing that the previous understanding based on the conventional electronic structure calculations was not enough .",
    "also , there was a debate regarding the detailed feature of electronic levels at @xmath18 ev revealed by x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) @xcite . according to xps and resonant xps ,",
    "the indication of lower hubbard band ( lhb ) of ru-4@xmath5 states is observed while the lda calculation predicts that those features should be attributed mainly to the oxygen states @xcite .",
    "the experimental effective mass ( @xmath19 25 ) is also significantly larger than the lda value @xcite .",
    "while dmft can be a reasonable alternative in this situation @xcite , its parameter dependency has caused the discrepancy even among the dmft results .",
    "for example , the calculations by pchelkina _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and by liebsch _",
    "@xcite seem to give different answers to the nature of the states at @xmath20 ev most likely due to their different choices of @xmath10 and @xmath21 values . beside the ambiguity in the double - counting term in dft+dmft , this parameter dependency is a well known problem for the first - principles description of the correlated electron systems .",
    "it is also noted that another well - established technique , dft@xmath22 , is not useful for paramagnetic sro214 because of its hartree - fock nature which always prefers the magnetic solution @xcite .",
    "for sro113 the situation is similar with sro214 ; while the overall features can be described by the conventional methods , the details are not clearly understood .",
    "note that dft@xmath22 can be used for this case as the ground state of sro113 is ( ferro ) magnetic . for the bulk phase , lda , lda+@xmath10 , and self - interaction correction ( sic ) give the correct ferromagnetic solution although the calculated moment shows some deviations @xcite .",
    "for the thin film sro113 , however , the experimentally observed metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) and the ferromagnetic - to - nonmagnetic transition as a function of layer thickness are not consistently reproduced by these techniques @xcite .",
    "for example , the single - layer sro113 is predicted to be either ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic depending on the choice of the exchange - correlation functional and the @xmath10 values @xcite . as in the case of sro214",
    ", dmft has made important contributions for sro113 @xcite , but it is still not completely satisfactory because of the limitations such as the parameter dependency .",
    "also , the details of the spectroscopic data of sro113 needs further clarifications @xcite .    in this paper , we re - investigate the electronic structure of these two classical @xmath23 transition - metal oxide systems by using quasiparticle self - consistent @xmath0 ( qs@xmath0 ) @xcite method .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this well - established calculation technique has never been applied to the ruthenates while @xmath0 self - energy can be expected to give a good description for the metallic and weakly correlated systems . despite of its limitation to take the hubbard - like on - site coulomb interactions into account , qs@xmath0 has a distinctive advantage as a fully self - consistent ` parameter - free ' technique . due to the recent experimental progress in making ` complex oxide ' structures such as thin film and heterointerface ,",

    "<S> using quasiparticle self - consistent @xmath0 calculations , we re - examined the electronic structure of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 and srruo@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the correlation effects beyond the conventional lda ( local density approximation ) and gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) are reasonably well captured by qs@xmath0 self - energy without any _ ad hoc _ parameter or any ambiguity related to the double - counting and the downfolding issues . while the spectral weight transfer to the lower and upper hubbard band is not observed , the noticeable bandwidth reduction and effective mass enhancement are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> important features in the electronic structures that have been debated over the last decades such as the photoemission spectra at around @xmath4 ev in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 and the half - metallicity for srruo@xmath3 are discussed in the light of our qs@xmath0 results and in comparison with the previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the promising aspects of qs@xmath0 are highlighted as the first - principles calculation method to describe the moderately correlated 4@xmath5 transition metal oxides along with its limitations . </S>"
