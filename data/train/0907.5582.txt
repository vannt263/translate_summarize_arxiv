    "developing a more detailed understanding of the numerous intriguing phenomena displayed by strongly correlated quantum systems is one of the major theoretical challenges in physics today . to meet this challenge a formidable arsenal of non - perturbative , renormalization and numerical techniques",
    "have been devised .",
    "the success of these approaches has for the most part been routed in situations at or close to equilibrium , while comparatively little is known about the physics of strongly - correlated systems far - from - equilibrium .",
    "yet non - equilibrium systems are both ubiquitous and of significant practical interest in physics .",
    "a typical example is where a finite sized strongly - correlated quantum system is driven far - from - equilibrium by introducing couplings to several different macroscopic reservoirs , forming an open quantum system  @xcite . under these circumstances",
    "both analytical and numerical descriptions of the behaviour of the system become highly non - trivial .",
    "an immediate need to study open quantum systems is given by the inevitable decoherence and dissipation present in any realistic experimental realization of a strongly correlated quantum system .",
    "numerous examples of such experiments now exist ranging from arrays of josephson junctions  @xcite , ultra - cold atoms in optical lattice  @xcite , ion traps  @xcite and arrays of coupled microcavities  @xcite . beyond this , however , open systems are becoming increasingly relevant in themselves as efforts are made to both understand , and also potentially exploit , the beautiful and subtle interplay of the coherent many - body dynamics and incoherent quantum processes they possess .",
    "one example can be found in quantum information processing  @xcite where the suppression of noise is typically considered a prerequisite . despite this it is found that certain dissipative processes can in fact assist in the preparation of highly entangled quantum states  @xcite .",
    "more generally some of the most common occurrences of non - equilibrium physics are in transport problems  @xcite relevant to numerous systems including quantum contacts  @xcite , molecular motors  @xcite , molecular junctions  @xcite and other low dimensional heat conducting quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition to revealing a wealth of non - equilibrium phenomena , including non - diffuse heat transfer  @xcite and negative differential conductance  @xcite , the presence of noise has been found , contrary to expectations , to enhance transmission efficiency through a dissipative quantum network  @xcite where it has a beneficial influence thanks to its interplay with destructive quantum interference and energy mismatches  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of technological relevance to better understand quantum mechanical effects in driven dissipative strongly - correlated systems in order to exploit them in achieving more robust and efficient energy transfer in artificial structures  @xcite and nanomaterials  @xcite .",
    "finally open quantum systems present a virtually unexplored landscape of non - equilibrium phases transitions whose properties are likely to differ considerably from conventional equilibrium transitions  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall adopt a master equation  @xcite description of an open quantum system .",

    "is elevated by the fact that only a very limited number of exactly solvable master equation models are known , namely those involving a single particle , harmonic oscillator or spin .",
    "indeed the presence of a non - equilibrium transition in this solvable model suggests that it may well come to represent a paradigm for such phenomena analogous to the ising model for quantum phase transitions .    in this work we present an entirely complementary exact solution of this system for the heisenberg picture evolution of commonly required observables by employing a matrix product ansatz",
    "@xcite for the operators , often called a matrix product operator ( mpo ) .",
    "this result is a significant extension of the exact mpo solution presented in  @xcite for the purely coherent limit of the same system . by using this approach our work provides , through the formal structure of the mpo solution , further physical insight into why this model is exactly solvable .",
    "the utility of our solution , however , is only truly revealed when it is combined with powerful matrix product based numerical methods , of which density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , and more recently its quantum information inspired extension to time - evolution  @xcite , are leading examples .",
    "these numerical methods enable the exact heisenberg picture mpo solution of the dynamical evolution of operators to be computed under very general situations which are not easily accessible otherwise . given the rich properties of the model  @xcite this in itself may be very useful .",
    "however , perhaps of even greater importance , it also provides a significant non - trivial example of where heisenberg picture mpo numerics is exact for an open system .",
    "it was shown  @xcite recently that in some cases it is much more efficient and accurate to simulate open quantum systems in the heisenberg picture and thus the underlying numerical method used here can be readily applied to more general interacting systems .",
    "in contrast to the equivalent schrdinger picture mpo numerics  @xcite where the study of entanglement has provided a crucial understanding of its strengths and limitation  @xcite , the merits of the heisenberg picture numerics for general situations is far less clear .",
    "our result provides further evidence in understanding when rigourously exact or good approximate heisenberg picture mpo solutions may exist .",

    "for this reason , and others , matrix product representations for both states and operators have been applied with considerable success in a variety of related numerical methods .",
    "the key to their success is that many states or operators , for 1d systems at least , can be very accurately approximated by a matrix product representation of small dimension despite formally requiring a much larger intractable dimension to be exact .",
