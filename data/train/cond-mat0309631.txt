    "this article is devoted to  the theoretical study of a self - organization problem of an ensemble of interacting species and to developing a model of a naturally fitted coevolving ecosystem .",
    "it is well known since eigen s work on replicating molecules @xcite that the quasispecies approach is very fruitful for modeling the fundamental behavior of evolution ( see , for example @xcite ) . despite a huge amount of papers devoted to this problem biological evolution",
    "is too complex that we are still far from understanding real biological processes of self - organization .",
    "the matter is that real experiments and obtained data on the evolution of primitive systems need a comprehensive theoretical description that would allow to explain these data and put them into a proper context . in this case",
    "the central place is put to the investigation of intrinsic properties of a nonlinear system which describe the system evolution .",
    "we put our attention to eigen s approach and will establish some new but very important mathematical properties of the system which could be useful for modeling many co - evolving ecosystem . in part we will use an approach devised in pg for describing similar systems of evolution .",
    "we start our analysis of qusispecies dynamics in molecular evolution with discussion of background of modeling aspects which appear to be very important for further .",
    "the first principle of modeling such types of dynamics we accept here is based on probability consideration of molecular replicator processes and which are well described by resulting quasispecies concentration vector @xmath0^{n}$ ] , where @xmath1 is a number of species , being normalized by the full probability condition @xmath2 the latter condition is fundamental ensuring the full molecular number concentration and will play , in what will follow , an important role . moreover , the set of such vectors @xmath3 in the euclidian space @xmath4  forms the algebraic symplicial submanifold @xmath5 on which in reality the studied dynamics holds .",
    "for it to be described analytically , it is naturally to consider a representative symmetric matrix @xmath6end@xmath7 such that @xmath8  @xmath9 for same vector @xmath10 modeling the resulting replicator dynamics simultaneously ensuring two constraints : life on the simplex @xmath11 and conservation of the initial molecular system information during its replicator evolution . in general , such a dynamics can be represented in the following form :    @xmath12    with evolution parameter @xmath13 , for some invertible mappings @xmath14 where @xmath15end@xmath4 is an initial molecular dynamics state . below we consider the symmetric replicator dynamics , whose the inverse replicator process matrix @xmath16 has to to coincide with the forward replicator process matrix @xmath17 that is the equality @xmath18 holds . as a result ,",
    "our dynamics is representable as @xmath19for all moments of time @xmath13 . assuming smooth dependence of ( [ * 1 ] ) on @xmath13 , one easily derives that the following lax type dynamics@xmath20   \\label{*2}\\]]holds , where by definition , the matrix @xmath21 for the matrix @xmath6end@xmath4 to conserve its symmetricity , the matrix @xmath22end@xmath4 must be evidently skew - symmetric , that is @xmath23 in @xmath24    return now back to analyzing the intrinsic structure of our matrix @xmath6end@xmath7 modeling replicator dynamics under regard . from the general form ( [ * 2 ] )",
    "one sees that our dynamics possesses a priori so called trace - invariants , namely , all quantities @xmath25 are such for any @xmath26 , where @xmath27end@xmath28 is the standard matrix trace operator .",
    "this fact may be naturally used within our modeling approach . really , consider a representative vector @xmath10 in the following form : @xmath29 then , the condition @xmath30 @xmath31 is satisfied due to  the equality @xmath32 @xmath33 and the fact that the latter quantity is conserved ! since @xmath34 , all of the other invariants are the same , introducing into the dynamics no additional constraint .",
    "thus , we have naturally imbedded our molecular replicator dynamics initially  in the space of concentration vectors @xmath35 into the matrix phase space @xmath36 of symmetric projector mappings of co - dimension one , that is @xmath37 and dim@xmath38im@xmath39 the latter phase space @xmath40 is still called a grassmann manifold possessing a lot of important intrinsic mathematical properties , which we shell use further for deeper analyzing our molecular replicator dynamics under regard .",
    "consider an evolution equation modeling our molecule replicator dynamics in the general matrix lax type form ( [ * 2 ] ) , where @xmath41 is a certain matrix  depending on variables @xmath42and@xmath43  in this case as the matrix @xmath44  symmetric , it is evident that the matrix @xmath45  must be skew - symmetric . below we will put the main attention to processes similar to qusispecies dynamics considered in @xcite .",
    "since we will consider @xmath0^{n}$]as a concentration vector of quasispecies , it has to be nonnegative for all time , so the system ( [ * 1 ] ) now is defined on the nonnegative orthant @xmath46    let us now suppose a system evolves due to the eigen positive feedback associated with the terms corresponding to the increase of concentrations @xmath47 @xmath48where an element @xmath49 expresses the probability that a molecule @xmath50 copies into a molecule @xmath51 and @xmath52 denotes the corresponding inverse sink term . in turn the element @xmath53gives the probability that a molecule @xmath51 replicates faithfully , @xmath54  is the fitness of the molecules of @xmath50 type and characterizes their replication rate .",
    "we have to determine the sink term @xmath55 , in order to fulfill the governing condition on the dynamic determined on the @xmath56 dimensional simplex @xmath57    in order to get the corresponding source term in the equation ( [ m2])let us determine elements @xmath58of the skew symmetric matrix @xmath45 in ( [ * 1 ] ) as@xmath59 ,   \\label{m3}\\]]it is easy to observe here that there exists the matrix @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 substituting expression ( [ m3 ] ) into ( [ * 1 ] ) we get that @xmath62 as a result the governing equation for the quasispecies dynamics takes the form :    @xmath63    it is easy to see after summing up equations ( [ m4 ] ) that    @xmath64    meaning in this case that the evolution dynamics is determined really on the simplex ( [ s ] ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the system ( [ m4 ] ) is a little bit diverse from systems considered in a set of papers @xcite mainly by sink terms .",
    "but namely only such a form of the sink term ensures the important simplex condition @xmath65 for all @xmath66 , without additional constraints involved in the model .",
    "note here that , the system ( [ m4 ] ) is really representable in the evolution form ( [ * 1 ] ) that can be checked easily , and the matrix @xmath6end@xmath67 is a one dimensional symmetric projector , that is @xmath68 for @xmath13 , being important for our further studying the structure of vector field ( [ * 1 ] ) on the corresponding projector matrix manifold @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the component vector form of the system ( [ m4 ] ) can be also represented as@xmath69with @xmath70 @xmath71 and  @xmath72 being a fitness matrix  expression .",
    "if the fitness matrix @xmath73  @xmath74  is diagonal one that is @xmath75  and does not depend on @xmath76 the system ( [ m5 ] ) evidently will be linear .",
    "thereby the solution of such a system can be obviously represented as @xmath77t,\\]]where @xmath78 is a concentration of population of each type at initial time .",
    "since our system dynamic flow ( [ * 2 ] ) in reality lives on the projector matrix of grassmann manifold @xmath36 @xcite , all its properties can be naturally extracted from deeper analysis of its structure on this manifold . in particular , it is important to know where the vector field ( [ m4 ] ) admits the structure of gradient type endowed  with some lyapunov function , ensuring the existence of stable states on the compact grassmann manifold @xmath40 . in order to study the gradient field structure of the flow ( [ * 1 ] ) if any on the projector matrix manifold @xmath79 let us consider a smooth functional @xmath80 whose usual variation is given as    @xmath81    with a symmetric matrix @xmath82end@xmath4 and sp@xmath83end@xmath84 being as before the standard matrix trace .",
    "taking into account the natural metrics on @xmath40 ,  we  consider the projection @xmath85  of the usual gradient vector field @xmath86 upon the tangent space @xmath87 under the following conditions :    @xmath88    holding on @xmath40 for all @xmath89end@xmath67.@xmath90the first condition is evidently equivalent to @xmath91 that is @xmath92 .",
    "thereby we can formulate such a statement .",

    "is chosen beforehand and other sequences are grouped all into error classes , according to their hamming distance from the chosen one .",
    "sequences which have the same hamming distance from the master one compile a one error class .",
    "such reduction of the dimensionality make it possible to get the problem acceptable for computer simulation and to reveal some features inherent to real bio world . in this case",

    "we simulate our model for simplest case @xmath197 the plot of computer simulation with matrix given by formulae ( [ ss3 ] ) is presented on fig.1 ( a , b ) .",
    "we can easily see that having the same initial conditions and matrix replication mutation matrix @xmath188 the results of the evolution process is quite different .",
    "let us find a stationary frequency distribution in the framework of derived model ( [ m4 ] ) .",
    "if we make set the right hand side of the equation ( m4 ) to zero we get for constant fitnesses the next expression      analyzing the expression ( [ si2 ] ) one can see that the values of the frequencies do not depend on diagonal elements @xmath199 and replicator process in this model is determined only by the input given by nondiagonal elements @xmath200 being natural from the biological point of  view . if the fitness value of some species @xmath201  is much greater than all of the rest fittnesses , the values of @xmath202  will be chosen less than all the others . in this case",
    "the results obtained for example for a single peak model landscape in the framework of ( [ si1 ] ) , which lead to so called  phase transition  and vanishing of the corresponding species named there master ones if @xmath203 be interpreted in another way @xcite@xmath204    the equation ( [ si2 ] ) can be evidently written down as a fixed point problem @xmath205 where @xmath206 with diagonal elements @xmath207 @xmath208 so , its solution exists if the matrix @xmath209 possesses the eigenvalue @xmath210 or the determinant equation @xmath211 where @xmath212 is unity matrix , is satisfied identically .",
    "but this fact is true for any matrix @xmath188 and arbitrary parameters @xmath213if this equation is not satisfied , the process of reducing some amount of species from the system happens , that is some of frequencies will become exactly zero  and the resulting system remains to live on a simplex of lower dimension .",
    "the latter situation can be considered as a phase reduction  naturally related with some threshold values of frequencies found from the determinant equation written above , against the notion of phase transition  used in cited above articles .",
    "this behavior is of great interest for diverse applications since it can be interpreted as some kind of simplex reduction @xmath214 for @xmath215 taking place in some kinds of replicator dynamics models .",
