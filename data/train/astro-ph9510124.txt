    "since the pioneering work of schiff and snyder@xcite , especially during the last 20 years , there has been considerable interest in the properties of matter in a strong magnetic field .",
    "while the early studies@xcite were mainly motivated by the fact that high magnetic field conditions can be mimicked in some semiconductors where a small effective mass and a large dielectric constant reduce the electric force relative to the magnetic force , the recent interest in this problem has been motivated by the huge magnetic field @xmath5 g already discovered in many neutron stars and the tentative suggestion for fields as strong as @xmath6 g. the surface layer of these neutron stars then consists of highly - magnetized matter . understanding the physical properties of atoms , molecular chains , and condensed matter in fields of such extreme magnitude ( see ref.@xcite for an early general review and @xcite for a recent text on atoms in strong magnetic fields ) is important for interpreting the radiation from the neutron stars that may be observed in the present and future x - ray satellites ( e.g. , @xcite ) , therefore provides important information about the internal structure of neutron stars .    in superstrong magnetic fields",
    "the structure of atoms and condensed matter is dramatically changed by the fact that the magnetic force on an electron is stronger than the coulomb force it experiences , i.e. , the electron cyclotron energy ( the landau energy level spacing ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath9 , is much larger than the typical coulomb energy . in the direction perpendicular to the field ,",
    "the electrons are confined to move on cylindrical landau orbitals around a nucleus .",
    "the orbitals have radii @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the cyclotron radius @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the bohr radius and @xmath14 is the atomic unit for the magnetic field strength , @xmath15 throughout this paper we consider strong fields in the sense of @xmath16 , so that the coulomb forces act as a perturbation to the magnetic forces on the electrons , and the electrons are confined to the ground landau level ( so called `` adiabatic approximation''@xcite ) .",
    "because of this extreme confinement of electrons in the transverse direction , the coulomb force becomes much more effective for binding electrons in the parallel direction , therefore giving greatly increased binding energy .",
    "the atom has a cigar - like structure .",
    "moreover , it is possible for these elongated atoms to form molecular chains by covalent bonding along the field direction@xcite .",
    "significant efforts have been devoted to the theoretical study of atoms in a superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath17 g ) @xcite .",
    "the methods that have been employed include variational calculations(e.g.,@xcite ) , thomas - fermi - type statistical models@xcite , density functional theory@xcite , and self - consistent hartree - fock method@xcite , which we consider to be the more theoretically justified and reliable a method .",
    "accurate calculations of the energy levels of the h atom in magnetic fields of arbitrary strength have also been performed@xcite .",
    "by contrast , there are only limited studies on molecules in superstrong magnetic field ; nearly all of these focus on the molecular ion h@xmath2 ( @xcite and references therein ) . as h@xmath2 is unstable against forming h@xmath0 , understanding the physical properties of h@xmath0",
    "molecule is of greater practical interest , since h@xmath0 is likely to exist in the atmosphere of sufficiently cool neutron stars@xcite    we have recently calculated the ground state binding energies of different forms of hydrogen ( h , h@xmath18 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath19 , @xmath20 , h@xmath21 ) in a strong magnetic field @xmath1 g ( @xmath22@xcite , hereafter referred as paper i ) . in particular , for the first time , reliable electronic dissociation energy of h@xmath0 molecule in magnetic field of such magnitude was obtained . in this paper",
    ", we extend our study to consider various excitation levels of the molecule . in the zero - field case , to study the molecular spectra , one usually uses born - oppenheimer approximation to separate the motion of the ions from that of the electrons .",
    "such a procedure is valid if the electronic energy - level spacings are large compared to the typical energy - level spacings associated with the ion motion . in a strong magnetic field",
    ", however , the separation of motion becomes much more complicated , even for the hydrogen atom@xcite .",
    "moreover , as we shall see , in a superstrong magnetic field , the energy - level spacings associated with the vibrations of the ions can be comparable to or even larger than the spacings of the electronic excitations . in this paper",
    ", we will use the standard born - oppenheimer approximation and focus on calculating the interatomic interaction potential for fixed ion positions ( sec .",
    "we then obtain the molecular excitation levels based on this potential curve ( sec .",
    "iv ) . as in the case of a neutral atom@xcite , it is convenient to define a critical field strength by equating the cyclotron energy of the proton @xmath23 to the typical electronic excitation energy ( @xmath24 in atomic units ) , i.e. , @xmath25 we shall give quantitative results for the regime @xmath26 in sec .",
    "ii - iv , using the standard born - oppenheimer procedure .",
    "rigorous calculations for the molecule when @xmath27 , taking account of the quantum mechanics of the proton motion , are difficult . nevertheless , in sec",
    ".  v we shall describe an approximate solution to the four - body problem of the h@xmath0 molecule in the @xmath4 regime , where the effects of finite proton mass on the electronic states and the energies of the molecule are strong , and we give a rigorous lower limit to the ground - state dissociation energy .    throughout this paper , we shall use nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , even for extremely strong magnetic field , @xmath28 g ( note that @xmath29 is close to @xmath30 only by coincidence ) , at which the transverse motion of the electron becomes relativistic .",
    "the nonrelativistic treatment of bound states is valid for two reasons : ( i ) the energy of a relativistic free electron @xmath31^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the linear momentum along the field axis , @xmath33 is the quantum number for the landau excitations , reduces to @xmath34 as along as the electron remains in the ground landau level and nonrelativistic in the @xmath35-direction ; ( ii ) the shape of the landau wavefunction in the relativistic theory is the same as in the nonrelativistic theory ( as we see from the fact that @xmath36 is independent of mass ) .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the binding energy of the bound state , the relativistic effect remains a small correction@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider some general features and approximate scaling relations for various excitation levels .",
    "iii contains a detailed description of our method for calculating the interatomic interaction potential .",
    "the numerical results and fitting formulae for the molecular excitation levels are presented in sec .",
    "we study the electronic structure of the molecule in the @xmath4 regime and consider the effects of finite proton mass on the energies in sec .  v. our general conclusion",
    "is presented in sec .",
    "appendix a summarizes some useful mathematical relations for the coulomb integrals of landau functions , and in appendix b we discuss a refined method for calculating the electronic energy of h@xmath2 for general orientation of the molecular axis .",
    "in a superstrong magnetic field satisfying @xmath16 , the spectra of a single h atom can be specified by two quantum numbers @xmath39 , where @xmath40 measures the mean transverse distance ( eq .  [ 1.2 ] ) of the electron to the proton , while @xmath41 is the number of nodes of electron s @xmath35-wavefunction ( along the field direction ) .",
    "the wavefunction of the @xmath39 state in cylindrical coordinates @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ground state landau wavefunction @xmath45 the states with @xmath46 resemble a zero - field hydrogen atom with small binding energy @xmath47@xcite and we shall mostly focus on the tightly - bound states with @xmath48 . for the ground state @xmath49 ,",
    "the sizes @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the atomic wavefunction perpendicular and parallel to the field and the binding energy @xmath52 ( in atomic units ) are given by @xmath53 we have similar relations but with @xmath36 replaced by @xmath54^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath55 replaced by @xmath56 $ ] , so that @xmath57 recall that in atomic units , mass is in units of the electron mass @xmath58 , energy is expressed in units of @xmath59 , length is in units of bohr radius @xmath60 , and the units for magnetic field is @xmath14 ( eq .

    "the spins of the electrons of the atoms in a strong magnetic field are all aligned anti - parallel to the magnetic field , and therefore two atoms in their ground states do not easily bind together according to the exclusion principle .",
    "thus two h atoms , both in the @xmath65 ground state , do not form tightly bound molecule . instead",
    ", one h atom has to be excited to the @xmath66 state .",
    "the two h atoms , one in the ground state ( @xmath65 ) , another in the @xmath66 state then form the ground state of h@xmath0 molecule by covalent bonding . since the `` activation energy '' for exciting an electron in the h atom from landau orbital @xmath40 to @xmath67 is small ( see eq .  [ 2.4 ] ) , the resulting molecule is stable .",
    "the interatomic separation @xmath68 and the dissociation energy @xmath69 of the h@xmath0 molecule scale approximately as @xmath70 where the dimensionless factor @xmath71 decreases very slowly with increasing @xmath72 ( e.g. , @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 ; see table i of paper i and our eq .",
    "[ 5.2 ] ) .",
    "another mechanism of forming h@xmath0 molecule in a superstrong magnetic field is to let both electrons occupy the same @xmath65 landau state , while one of them occupies the @xmath48 orbital and another @xmath77 orbital .",
    "this costs no `` activation energy '' .",
    "however , the resulting molecule tends to have small dissociation energy , of order a rydberg .",
    "we shall refer to this electronic state of the molecule as the _ weakly - bound state _",
    ", to the states formed by two electrons in the @xmath48 orbitals as the _ tightly - bound states_. as we will see below , as long as @xmath78 , the weakly - bound state only constitutes an excited energy level of the molecule .",
    "we now consider various molecular excitations and derive approximate scaling relations for the excitation energies .",
    "the electronic excitations of h@xmath2 are similar to those of the h atom , namely the electron can occupy different @xmath40 landau orbitals . thus @xmath65 is the ground state , @xmath79 are the excited states ( although they are not necessarily bound relative to the free atom in the ground state ) .",
    "there are two types of electronic excitations in h@xmath0 .",
    "( i ) the electrons can occupy different orbitals other than the ground state @xmath80 , giving rise to the tightly - bound ( @xmath48 ) electronic excitations .",
    "for example , the first excited level is @xmath81 , the second excited level is @xmath82 , etc .",
    "the number of single @xmath40-excitation states @xmath83 which are bound relative to two isolated h atoms in the ground state is expected to increase as the magnetic field increases .",
    "double @xmath40-excitations are also possible , but as we shall see , they are bound only when the magnetic field strength is much higher than @xmath84 g. the energy spacing between the two adjacent electronic states @xmath85 and @xmath86 is @xmath87 thus as @xmath40 increases , the energy spacing decreases .",
    "( ii ) the molecule is formed by two electrons in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 orbitals .",
    "the dissociation energy of this weakly - bound state is of order a rydberg , and does not depend sensitively on the magnetic field strength .",
    "note that for relatively small magnetic field ( @xmath90 ) , the weakly - bound state actually has lower energy than the tightly - bound states ( see sec .",
    "iv.a ) , i.e. , @xmath91 is required for the `` strong field '' regime to apply fully .",
    "in the born - oppenheimer approximation , the motion of the two protons is governed by the interatomic potential @xmath92 , i.e. , the electronic energy when the relative positions of the protons are kept at @xmath93 along the field direction and @xmath94 perpendicular to it .",
    "we first consider the aligned vibrational excitations for oscillations of @xmath93 about the equilibrium separation @xmath68 .",
    "for this purpose we need to estimate the excess potential @xmath95 .    since @xmath68 is the equilibrium position , the sum of the first order terms in @xmath96 , coming from proton - proton , electron - electron , proton - electron coulomb energies and quantum mechanical electron kinetic energy , must cancel .",
    "thus we have @xmath97 for small @xmath96 .",
    "consider various contributions to the energy of the molecule : the proton - proton interaction is @xmath98 ( in atomic units ) without a logarithmic factor ; but the dominant contribution is the proton - electron coulomb energy @xmath99 , where the logarithmic factor @xmath78 comes from the coulomb integral over the `` cigar - shaped '' electron distribution . both @xmath55 and @xmath100 change as @xmath101 , but",
    "the largest change comes from the quadratic term @xmath102 .",
    "thus the excess potential is of order @xmath103    in atomic ( electron ) units the reduced mass of the proton - pair in h@xmath0 is @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath58 are proton and electron mass ( for hd the factor @xmath106 is replaced by @xmath107 ) . for small - amplitude oscillations in the potential of equation ( 2.7 ) , we obtain a harmonic oscillation spectrum with excitation energy quanta @xmath108 given by @xmath109 for a molecule in the ground electronic state . the scaling with @xmath72 of @xmath108",
    "is thus almost the same as the dissociation energy @xmath69 in eq .",
    "the number of aligned vibrational levels is @xmath110 , where @xmath71 decreases even more slowly with increasing field strength than @xmath111 does .",
    "the strong magnetic field breaks the rotational symmetry for the molecular axis and , instead of rotations of the field - free case we have oscillations in the two - dimensional plane of the @xmath112 vector . since the transverse vibrational excitation energy is larger than the aligned vibrational excitation , the timescale for the protons to adjust their @xmath113positions is much longer than the timescale for oscillations with @xmath114 and we can consider transverse vibrations with fixed values of @xmath93 .",
    "however , since @xmath115 , an approximate separation is possible with @xmath93 replaced by @xmath68 for the transverse vibrations . ] .",
    "the degeneracy in the azimuthal angle @xmath116 is still retained .",
    "to study the transverse vibration spectrum , we need to estimate the order of magnitude of the excess potential @xmath117 .    as mentioned before , the factor @xmath55 in the expression @xmath118 for the dissociation energy @xmath69 ( eq .  [ 2.5 ] ) comes from a coulomb integral over the electron charge distribution .",
    "this integral is of the form @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the typical size of the electron wavefunction perpendicular to the field for @xmath121 . when the protons are displaced by @xmath122 from the electron distribution axis , the coulomb integral can be approximately obtained by replacing @xmath36 with @xmath123 .",
    "our order of magnitude expression for @xmath124 is then @xmath125 equation ( 2.9 ) holds for any @xmath126 , but it can be approximated by a quadratic expression for the small - amplitude case of @xmath127 . in this approximation",
    "we have @xmath128 .",
    "the energy quanta for the small - amplitude transverse vibration is then @xmath129 where the subscript @xmath130 indicates that we are at the moment neglecting the magnetic forces on the protons which , in the absence of coulomb forces , lead to the cyclotron motions of the protons .",
    "note that @xmath131 in eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) increases as @xmath132 with increasing field strength , faster than the logarithmic behavior of @xmath133 and @xmath69 , but slower than the linear behavior of the cyclotron energy . for sufficiently large @xmath16",
    "we have @xmath134 . however , the quadratic harmonic oscillator approximation is valid only for @xmath135 up to @xmath136 , i.e. , for @xmath124 only up to @xmath137 , which is less than the maximum possible potential @xmath138 .",
    "the number of harmonic oscillation levels in the quadratic regime is then @xmath139 the degeneracy of the @xmath140-th harmonic oscillation level is @xmath140 . for @xmath141 ,",

    "for very low surface temperature ( @xmath441 k ) , the atmosphere is likely to condensate into a metallic state , since the hydrogen metal has the largest binding energy .",
    "however , for the astrophysically more interesting temperature range ( @xmath442 k ) , the outer layer of a neutron star will predominantly exists in the form of nondegenerate gas of individual atoms and small molecules : e.g. , when @xmath443 k , the photosphere of a neutron star is dominated by atoms if @xmath242 , while it is dominated by h@xmath0 if @xmath444 .",

    "<S> we study the energy levels of h@xmath0 molecules in a superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath1 g ) , typically found on the surfaces of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the interatomic interaction potentials are calculated by a hartree - fock method with multi - configurations assuming electrons are in the ground landau state . </S>",
    "<S> both the aligned configurations and arbitrary orientations of the molecular axis with respect to the magnetic field axis are considered . </S>",
    "<S> different types of molecular excitations are then studied : electronic excitations , aligned ( along the magnetic axis ) vibrational excitations , transverse vibrational excitations ( a constrained rotation of the molecular axis around the magnetic field line ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar results for the molecular ion h@xmath2 are also obtained and compared with previous variational calculations . </S>",
    "<S> both numerical results and analytical fitting formulae are given for a wide range of field strengths . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the zero - field case , it is found that the transverse vibrational excitation energies can be larger than the aligned vibration excitation , and they both can be comparable or larger than the electronic excitations . for @xmath3 g , the landau energy of proton is appreciable and there is some controversy regarding the dissociation energy of h@xmath0 . we show that h@xmath0 is bound even for @xmath4 and that neither proton has a landau excitation in the ground molecular state . </S>"
