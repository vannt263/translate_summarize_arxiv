    "sagittarius  a@xmath0 ( sgr  a@xmath0 ) is a compact source with emissions from radio to x - ray , and it is believed to be associated with the galactic center black hole ( gcbh ) .",
    "sgr  a@xmath0 was observed at many wavelengths , and temporal flux variations were reported .",
    "time variability observation is a powerful tool to probe the structure and emission mechanisms . from mm to submm wave , intra - day variability ( idv ) , flux variability with a timescale of a few hours , has been observed frequently ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * miyazaki et al .",
    "the emitter of sgr  a@xmath0 is in controversy but undoubtedly the emissions come from very near the gcbh",
    ". one of possibilities that have been proposed as the radio emitter is expanding plasma ejected near gcbh .",

    "these time lags are consistent with the model that the radio flux is emitted from adiabatically expanding plasma",
    ". however , additional observations at other frequencies are needed to verify it .",
    "aiming to detect a small time lag , we observed the flux densities of sgr  a@xmath0 at 90 and 102  ghz on 6 april 2005 using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) in japan .",
    "the flux densities at 90 and 102  ghz were simultaneously obtained with 1  ghz bandwidth .",
    "we alternately observed sgr  a@xmath0 and nrao530 ( 2.16  jy in april 2005 ) as calibrator .",
    "the visibility data are restricted to the projected baseline larger than 25  @xmath2 in order to suppress the contamination from the extended components around sgr  a@xmath0 .",

    "it is obviously the idv had a rising phase and broad intensity peak .",
    "the idv timescale for a two - fold increase is estimated to be about 2 hour assuming that the increase has a constant gradient .",
    "we calculated the _ z_-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "the peak time lag estimated by fitting the data to a quadratic function in the range @xmath3time lag@xmath4  hr is @xmath5  min .",
