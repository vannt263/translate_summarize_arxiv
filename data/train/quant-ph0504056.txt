    "solid state systems are promising candidates for novel scalable quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "however , intrinsic features of solid - state - based channels , such as finite correlation length and environment - induced decoherence , may limit this scalability .",
    "thus , it is crucial to coherently connect two or more quantum channels by using suitable quantum nodes .",
    "coherently interfacing two quantum systems requires a high fidelity transfer of quantum states between them .",
    "here we describe a physical mechanism for interfacing a nanomechanical resonator ( namr ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and a superconducting transmission line resonator ( tlr )  @xcite , i.e. , a quantum transducer between mechanical and electrical signals",
    ". with increasing quality factors ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) and large eigenfrequencies ( e.g. , @xmath1 mhz - ghz ) , namrs have been fabricated in the nearly quantum regime and proposed as candidates for either entangling two jj qubits   @xcite , or demonstrating progressive quantum decoherence  @xcite .",
    "a superconducting tlr has recently been demonstrated  @xcite as a quantized boson mode strongly coupled to a josephson junction ( jj ) charge qubit  @xcite .",
    "many new possibilities can be explored for studying the strong interaction between light and macroscopic quantum systems  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle , the quantized boson modes of namrs and tlrs can be regarded as quantum data buses ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "also , theoretical proposals have been made for interfacing these with optical qubits  @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the quantum integration of solid - state qubits and their data buses .",
    "in particular , we study how to connect two very different quantum channels , a mechanical and an electrical , provided by the namr and tlr , through a quantum node implemented by a cooper pair box ( cpb ) or charge qubit .",
    "our system can be considered the _ quantum analog of the transducer found in classical telephones ( mechanical vibrations converted into electrical signals and vice versa)_. because these three quantum objects ( namr , tlr , and cpb ) have been respectively realized experimentally with fundamental frequencies of _ the same order _ , it is quite natural to expect that they can be effectively coupled with each other .",
    "the physical principle behind our approach is similar to a theoretical prediction from cavity qed  @xcite : interacting with a common two - level atom , two off - resonant boson fields can be effectively entangled and then the quantum state tomography of a mode can be done with a high fidelity from the output of another .",
    "we similarly use the charge qubit as an artificial atom to coherently link two kinds of boson modes , the tlr and the namr ones .",
    "this quantum - node - induced interaction is controllable and can be freely switched - on and -off .",
    "a direct tlr and namr coupling through the gate voltage is problematic because the on - chip coupling can not be easily controlled .    the physical mechanism , describe below , to prepare the quasi - classical state of the namr has an atomic cavity qed analogue .",
    "consider an atom located in an optical resonator , and a classical pump laser also going through the cavity  @xcite .",
    "the atom interacts with the cavity field and the laser , and therefore couples the classical laser to the quantized cavity field .",
    "when the atom is off - resonance with respect to the cavity , the cavity mode can behave as a forced harmonic oscillator , where the external force is effectively supplied by the classical laser .",
    "thus , the coherent state of the cavity mode can be generated and controlled by the driving laser .",
    "this analogy motivates us to consider an inverse of the above scheme generating the namr coherent state .",
    "we set the tlr in a classical oscillation with a single frequency",
    ". this oscillation plays the role of the classical pump laser in the case of cavity qed .",
    "the off - resonant charge qubit interacts with both the namr and trl , and thus induces an external force on the namr .",
    "this force will drive the boson mode of the namr into a coherent state .",
    "the proposed transducer is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "a horizontal tlr is fabricated coplanar with a cpb .",
    "the charge state of the cpb can be controlled by the gate voltage @xmath2 applied to the gate capacitor @xmath3 .",
    "the cpb is also coupled to a large superconductor , the thermal bath , through two jjs with tunnelling energy @xmath4 .",
    "the squid geometry also allows to apply external magnetic fluxes to control the charge state of the cpb . a namr ( at the bottom of fig .",
    "1 ) with fundamental frequency @xmath5 and mass density @xmath6 is coupled to the cpb through the distributed capacitance @xmath7 , which depends on the displacement @xmath8 quantized by @xmath9=1 $ ] .",
    "let us assume that the distance fluctuations of the namr are much smaller than the distance @xmath10 between the namr and the cpb .",
    "thus , the generic formula @xmath11 of the parallel plate capacitance , with effective area @xmath12 , becomes @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distributed capacitance of the namr in equilibrium .",
    "it is the @xmath15-dependence of @xmath16 that couples the cpb to the  namr , with free hamiltonian @xmath17 . for small josephson junctions ,",
    "we assume that the equilibrium capacitance @xmath14 and the gate one @xmath3 are much less than @xmath18 . in the neighborhood of @xmath19 the joint system ( cpb and namr )",
    "can be approximately described by an effective spin - boson hamiltonian    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 above , we have neglected the high frequency term proportional to @xmath24 @xmath25 is the total effective capacitance .",
    "the pauli matrices ( @xmath26 of the quasi - spin are defined with respect to two isolated charge states , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , of the cpb .",
    "the coupling between the cpb and the tlr results from the total external magnetic flux @xmath29 through the squid loop of effective area @xmath30 @xmath31 . here",
    ", @xmath32 is a classical flux used to control the josephson energy and @xmath33 is the quantized flux arising from the quantization of the current @xmath34 in the trl .",
    "we assume that the squid is placed near the point where the amplitude of the magnetic field is largest ; @xmath35 @xmath36 is the distance between the line and the squid , and @xmath37 is the vacuum permeability .",
    "the quantized current in the tlr can be directly obtained from the quantization of the voltage ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) through the continuous kirchhoff s equation @xmath38 at the anti - node @xmath39 , the quantized current @xmath40 takes its maximum amplitude @xmath41 to create a quantized flux @xmath42here , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the inductance and capacitance per unit length , respectively . at low temperatures ,",
    "the qubit can be only designed to couple a single resonance mode of @xmath46 of the tlr , and then the flux felt by the qubit becomes @xmath47 usually , the quantized flux @xmath48 produced by the trl is not strong , so that we can expand the josephson energy to first order in @xmath49 .",
    "this results in a linear interaction between the charge qubit and the single mode quantized field .",
    "namely , the josephson coupling @xmath50 can be linearized as @xmath51 the effective coupling @xmath52 can be controlled by the classical external flux @xmath32 .",
    "now we choose a new dressed basis ( spanned by @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) to simplify the above total hamiltonian under the rotating - wave approximation . here , the mixing angle @xmath55\\ ] ] is calculated with the effective qubit spacing @xmath56 in terms of the the corresponding quasi - spin ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) , we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath58where two effective coupling constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 can also be well controlled by the classical flux .",
    "the coherent interfacing between the tlr and a namr implies that quantum states can be perfectly transferred between them .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be the hilbert spaces of the tlr and namr , respectively , and @xmath63 @xmath64  the initial state of the total system .",
    "a generic coherent interfacing is defined by the factorization of the time evolution @xmath65 at a certain instance @xmath66 without any man - made intervention .",
    "that is , the local information carried by @xmath67 in @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) can be perfectly mapped into another localized in @xmath62 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "to explore the essence of the interface between the tlr and the namr , we first consider the degenerate case , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the dynamics of the degenerate two - mode boson field coupled to a common two - level atom has been extensively investigated both analytically and numerically  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been proved that , when one mode is in a coherent state at the initial time @xmath69 and another mode is the vacuum , an oscillatory net exchange , with a large number of photons , happens and thus there indeed exists a coherent transfer of quantum information between them .",
    "however , the exchange of photons between the two modes also displays an amplitude decay and hence this transfer is not perfect , even without dissipation and decoherence induced by the environment .",
    "in fact , the revivals and collapses in the boson populations take place over a time - scale much longer than that of the atomic rabi oscillations decay  @xcite",
    ".    the above  dynamic collapse \" effect can be overcome by adiabatically eliminating the variables of the cpb in the large detuning limit : @xmath70 this limit can always be reached , as the effective qubit spacing @xmath71 is adjustable by controlling the gate voltage . using the frhlich - nakajima transformation  @xcite ,",

    "the non - zero frequency difference @xmath83 between the modes @xmath12 and @xmath82 results in the coherent exchange of these boson numbers .",

    "for @xmath100 , one can easily see that @xmath98 can reach unity while @xmath101 vanishes .",
    "this implies that a perfect exchange of quantum states can be implemented between the namr and the trl .",
    "mathematically , when @xmath102 and @xmath103 define two complementary oscillations with amplitudes ranging from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "the simple amplitude complementary relation @xmath106 and the same phase factor means a perfect transfer of quantum states .",
    "physically , @xmath100 means that the effective couplings @xmath107 and @xmath108 , of the namr and the tlr , are the same .",
    "indeed , we can realize the perfect transfer of quantum information at the moments @xmath109 for @xmath110 , i.e. , the wave function can be factorized into @xmath111 by a known unitary transformation @xmath112 which is independent of the initial state .",
    "in the degenerate case we have demonstrated the perfect transmission of quantum states between the namr and tlr by connecting them via a charge qubit . in principle , it is also possible to perform quantum information transfer between two non - degenerate modes .",
    "in fact , the model of two non - degenerate modes coupled to a two - level system can be solved exactly , and the phenomenon of rapid - collapse and revival could be shown  @xcite . however , it is convenient to adiabatically eliminate the connecting qubit for directly transferring quantum states between the two non - degenerate modes .",
    "again , we assume that the large detuning condition is still satisfied . to directly connect the two non - degenerate modes by adiabatically eliminating the qubit",

    "above , we have discussed how to transfer a quantum state from the namr to the tlr .",
    "now , we investigate the preparation of a quasi - classical state of the namr , driven by a classical current input from the tlr . adiabatically eliminating the connecting qubit results in an indirectly coupling between the tlr and the namr . via such a virtual process",
    ", the current in tlr produces an effective linear force acting on the namr mode . this force causes a quasi - classical deformation of the namr",
    "therefore , a coherent state , which is described by a displaced gaussian wave packet in the spatial position , can be generated in the namr mode .",
    "for this goal , we treat the driving current classically by the bogliubov approximation , that replaces the above annihilation and creation operators @xmath80 and @xmath149 by the complex amplitudes @xmath150 $ ] and @xmath151 $ ] respectively , where the real numbers @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the amplitude and phase of the classical current , respectively .",
    "we assume , like in the previous section , that the large detuning condition is still satisfied .",
    "thus , one can adiabatically eliminate the connected qubit and obtain a semi - classical hamiltonian @xmath154with @xmath155 .",

    "the square of the coherent state amplitude represents the population rate of the boson excitation in the transmission line .    to this end , we require a classical tlr current in a single mode , which plays a similar role as the classical pump laser in optical masers . while switching on the coupling with the off - resonance charge qubit for a while , the charge qubit results in a virtual process as an effective linear force on a namr mode .",
    "it thus causes a quasi - classical deformation of the namr , described by a coherent state , which is a displaced gaussian wave packet in the spatial position .",
    "this physical mechanism is very similar to that of the pulsed atomic laser  @xcite .    even without adiabatic elimination for large detuning",
    ", we can still achieve the same qualitative conclusion for the state preparation .",
    "in the two cases : ( a ) @xmath159 , and ( b ) @xmath160 , the achieved semi - classical hamiltonian @xmath161\\ ] ] describes a driven jaynes - commings model .",
    "now , we can uniquely deal with both cases as follows .",
    "if we define the displaced boson operator @xmath162 @xmath163 becomes the standard jaynes - commings hamiltonian with interaction @xmath164 , but its ground state experiences a symmetry - breaking .",
    "let @xmath165 be the displaced fock state defined by the coherent state generator @xmath166 the ground state of the namr - cpb composite system is just a product state @xmath167 , basically consisting of a coherent state of the namr .",
    "this simple observation reveals that the charge - qubit - based preparation of the quasi - classical state of the namr is robust .",
    "in summary , we propose a mechanism to interface a transmission line resonator ( tlr ) with a nano - mechanical resonator ( namr ) by commonly coupling them to a charge qubit , a cooper pair box with a controllable gate voltage .",

    "also , with such an interface , a quasi - classical state of the namr can be created by controlling a single - mode classical current in the tlr .",
