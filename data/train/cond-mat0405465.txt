    "it is interesting to note that all the semiconductor devices that have had a sustaining impact on integrated microelectronics were invented before 1974 ,  @xcite the year when chang , esaki and tsu reported the first observation of negative differential resistance ( ndr ) in semiconductor heterojunction resonant - tunneling diodes ( rtd ) .",
    "@xcite the operation of such semiconductor devices relies on the ( controlled ) presence of imperfections in otherwise perfect crystals ,  @xcite through doping or through interfaces between materials with different electronic and/or lattice structures .",
    "doping introduces electronic impurities ( electrons / holes ) into the otherwise perfect band structure through introducing atomic impuries ( dopants ) into the otherwise perfect lattice structure .",
    "@xcite the presence of interfaces , on the other hand , induces spatial charge and potential inhomogeneities which control the injection and modulate the motion of excess charge carriers within the device .",
    "a number of fundamental buiding blocks of microelectronics can therefore be identified according to the interface structures that control the device operation ,  @xcite including metal - semiconductor ( ms ) interfaces , semiconductor homo-(p - n ) junctions , semiconductor heterojunctions and metal - insulator - semiconductor ( mis ) interfaces .",
    "@xcite despite the continuous shrinking of feature size and correspondingly the increasing importance of hot - carrier and quantum mechanical effects ,  @xcite the design and operation of semiconductor transistors have followed remarkably well the scaling rules for device miniaturization  @xcite derived from the semi - classical semiconductor transport equations .",
    "@xcite there are also theoretical arguments that support the use of semiclassical pictures even in high - field transport  @xcite and nanoscale ballistic silicon transistors .",
    "@xcite    the discovery of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) in the early 1990s  @xcite has led to intense world - wide activity exploring their electrical properties and potential applications in nanoelectronic devices .",
    "@xcite swnts are nanometer - diameter all - carbon cylinders with unique structure - property relations : they consist of a single graphene sheet wrapped up to form a tube and their physical properties are controlled by the boundary conditions imposed on the wrapping directions .",
    "they provide ideal artifical laboratories for studying transport on the length scale ranging from the molecular limit as all - carbon cylindrical molecules to the bulk limit as quasi - one - dimensional quantum wires with the same lattice configuration and local bonding environment .",
    "@xcite many device concepts well known in conventional semiconductor microelectronics have been successfully demonstrated on a single - tube basis , ranging from intramolecular homo(hetero)-junctions , modulation doping to field - effect transitors .",
    "@xcite this prompts interest in knowing if the physical mechanisms underlying the operation of conventional microelectronic devices remain valid down to such ultra - small scales .",
    "research on swnt - based nanoelectronic devices therefore presents unique opportunities both for exploring novel device technology functioning at the nano / molecular - scale and for re - examining the physical principles of semiconductor microelectronics from the bottom - up atomistic approach .",
    "in addition , the concepts and techniques developed can be readily generalized to investigate other quasi - one - dimensional nanostructures , in particular semiconductor nanowires .",
    "@xcite    among the device physics problems arising in this context , the nature of electron transport through a metal - semiconducting swnt interface  @xcite stands out due to its simplicity and its role as one of the basic device building blocks .",
    "@xcite as the device building block , it is also crucial for understanding the mechanisms and guiding the design of swnt - based electrochemical sensors ,  @xcite electromechanical devices ,  @xcite and field - effect transistors ( ntfet ) ,  @xcite where electron transport through the metal - swnt - metal junction is modulated through molecular adsorption , mechanical strain and electrostatic gate field respectively .",
    "note that in the case of ntfet , metals have been used as the source , drain and gate electrodes , in contrast to silicon - based transistors which use heavily - doped polycrystalline materials .",
    "@xcite    the nature of charge transport through metal - semiconductor interfaces has been actively investigated for decades due to their importance in microelectronic technology ,  @xcite but is still not fully resolved , in particular regarding the mechanism of schottky barrier formation / height and high - field transport phenomena .",
    "@xcite compared to their bulk semiconductor counterpart , metal - swnt interfaces present new challenges in that : ( 1 ) both the contact area and the active device region can have atomic - scale dimensions ; ( 2 ) the quasi - one - dimensional structure ( cylindrical for nanotube materials ) makes the screening of electron - electron interaction ineffective and leads to long range correlation between electrons within swnt - based devices ; ( 3 ) last but probably the most important difference lies in the fact that quasi - one - dimensional wires , no matter how long , can not be treated as electron reservoirs .",
    "@xcite this is partly due to the fact that the restricted phase space in such systems prevents rapid relaxation of injected carriers to a pre - defined equilibrium state through electron - electron and/or electron - phonon scatterings . but more importantly , this can be understood from a simple geometrical argument : since the total current is conserved , there will always be a finite current density flowing along the wire and consequently a non - equilibrium state persists no matter how strong electron - electron and/or electron - phonon scattering is .",
    "an equilibrium state can be achieved only through the widened ( adiabatic ) contact with the ( three - dimensional ) metallic electrodes ( or other macroscopic measurement apparatus ) attached to them , where the finite current density can be effectively `` diluted '' through the larger cross sectional area .",
    "@xcite _ correspondingly electron transport through metal - swnt interfaces can only be studied within the configuration of metal - swnt - metal junction _ ( as are other quasi - one - dimensional systems ) , in contrast to the planar metal - semiconductor interface , where the presence of the second electrode can be implicitly neglected and the analysis of transport characteristics proceeds by analyzing the interface region and the bulk semiconductor region separately .",
    "@xcite    the last fact has important implications in the assessment of schottky barrier effects on the measured transport characteristics , since transport mechanisms both at the interface and inside the active device region have to be considered simultaneously even for a long nanotube .",
    "since the back - scattering of electrons by impurities  @xcite and the low - energy acoustic phonons  @xcite are weak in such quasi - one - dimensional systems , the nature of the electron transport through metal - swnt interfaces generally depends on the type of the swnts ( length / diameter / chirality ) , the type of the contacts , and the temperature and bias voltage range .",
    "experimentally , this matter is further complicated by the different fabrication / contact schemes used and the lack of knowledge of the atomic structure of the swnt junctions .",
    "recent works have studied electrical transport through a metal - long carbon nanotube interface using the bulk ( infinitely long ) band structures and electrostatics of ideal cylinders  @xcite . for nanoelectronics research",
    ", it will be important to explore the device functionality of finite - size carbon nanotubes with lengths ranging from nanometers to tens of nanometers .",
    "since most of the swnt devices currently investigated are based on swnts with length of @xmath0 or longer , an investigation of the finite - size effect will shed light on the scaling limit of carbon nanotube devices ,  @xcite as well as establish the validity or viability of using bulk device physics concepts in nanotube device research .",
    "the finite - size swnt can be either a finite cylindrical all - carbon molecule attached to the metal surfaces through the dangling bonds at the end ( end - contact scheme ) ,  @xcite a finite segment of a long carbon nanotube wire whose ends are buried inside the metallic electrodes ( embedded - contact scheme ) ,  @xcite or a finite segment of a long nanotube wire which is deposited on top of predefined metallic electrodes and side - contacted to the surfaces of the electrodes ( side - contact sheme ) .",
    "@xcite in the case of finite swnt molecules , a transition from the molecular limit to the bulk ( infinitely long ) limit in the electronic structure will occur as the length of the finite swnt varies from nanometers to tens of nanometers . in the case of long swnt wires , the electronic structure of the finite swnt segment remains that of the bulk ( which may be perturbed by the coupling to the electrodes ) , but the electrostatics of the metal - swnt - metal junction varies with the swnt length . due to the nanoscale contact geometry and reduced dimensionality of swnts ,",
    "a correct description of the schottky barrier formation at the metal - finite swnt interface generally requires an atomistic description of the electronic processes throughout the metal - swnt - metal junctions .",
    "the purpose of this work is thus to present a self - consistent atomistic analysis of the electronic and transport properties of the metal - swnt interfaces within the configuration of metal - swnt - metal junction as a function of the swnt length , which is varied from the nanometer to tens of nanometer range .",
    "in contrast to previous theoretical works ,  @xcite we use a novel green s function based self - consistent tight - binding ( sctb ) theory in real - space , which takes fully into account the three - dimensional electrostatics and the atomic - scale electronic structure of the swnt junctions . in accordance with the nanometer length - scale of the swnt studied ,",
    "we treat electron transport within the coherent transport regime .",
    "@xcite in this first paper , we consider the device formed by attaching a finite cylindrical swnt molecule to the electrode surface through the dangling bonds at the end ( fig .",
    "[ xuefig1 ] ) .",
    "the case of a finite - segment of long swnt wires in both embedded - contact and side - contact schemes will be treated in the subsequent paper .",
    "the device configuration considered here represents an atomic - scale analogue ( both the contact area and the active device region are atomic - scale ) to the planar metal - semiconductor interface , where dangling bonds also exist at the semiconductor surface layers and contribute to the schottky barrier formation .",
    "@xcite compared to other molecular - scale devices where the individual organic molecule is self - assembled onto the metallic electrode through appropriate end groups  @xcite , the swnt molecule presents a homogeneous device structure where the only electronic inhomogeneity is introduced at the metal - swnt interface through the ring of dangling - bond carbon atoms .",
    "the device structure considered here thus provides an ideal system for studying the length dependence of device characteristics on an atomic scale .",
    "in particular , the effect of the coupling strength can be studied by varing the swnt end - electrode surface distance .",

    "we analyze the evolution of the swnt electronic structure with the length of the swnt molecules in section iii . we devote section iv to analyzing the nature of schottky barrier formation at the metal - swnt molecule interface by examining the electrostatics ( change transfer and electrostatic potential change ) , the electron transmission characteristics and the `` band '' lineup . in section",
    "v , we present the temperature and length dependence of the swnt junction conductance .",
    "we show in section vi that the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics of the swnt junction are sensitive to the spatial variation of the voltage drop across the junction .",
    "finally in section vii , we summarize our results and discuss their implications for the functioning of swnt - based devices .",
    "a preliminary report of some of the results presented here has been published elsewhere .",
    "@xcite we use atomic units throughout the paper unless otherwise noted .",
    "modeling electron transport in nanoscale devices is much more difficult than in bulk and mesoscopic semiconductor devices due to the necessity of including microscopic treatment of the electronic structure and the contacts to the measurement electrodes , which requires combining the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of a open quantum system  @xcite with an atomistic modeling of the electronic structure .",
    "@xcite . for small molecular - scale devices where the inelastic carrier scattering can be neglected ,",
    "this has been done using a self - consistent matrix green s function ( scmgf ) method ,  @xcite which combines the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) theory of quantum transport  @xcite with an effective single - particle description of the electronic structure using density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "@xcite to treat larger nanoscale systems , e.g. , carbon nanotubes or semiconductor nanowires containing thousands or tens of thousands of atoms , a simpler tight - binding - type theory is more appropriate .",
    "@xcite correspondingly , we have developed a real - space self - consistent tight - binding ( sctb ) method which includes atomic - scale description of the electronic structure and the three - dimensional electrostatics of the metal - swnt - metal junction .",
    "the method is essentially the semi - empirical version of the scmgf method for treating molecular electronic devices and is applicable to arbitrary nanostructured devices .",
    "the details and applications of the scmgf method have been described extensively elsewhere  @xcite , here we give a brief summary of the self - consistent tight - binding implementation .",
    "the method starts from the hamiltonian @xmath1 describing the isolated nanostructure and the bare metallic electrodes , which can be obtained using either _ ab initio _ or empirical approaches as appropriate .",
    "the effect of the coupling to the electrodes is included as self - energy operators .",
    "@xcite the coupling to the external contacts leads to charge transfer between the electrodes and the nanostructure . applying a finite bias voltage also leads to charge redistribution ( screening ) within the nanostructure .",
    "both the effect of the coupling to the contact and the screening of the applied field thus introduced will need to be treated self - consistently .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the coupled metal - nanostructure - metal junction is thus @xmath2 $ ] , where an external potential of the type @xmath3 should be added in the case of a nonzero source - drain or gate voltage and @xmath4 is the change in the charge density distribution .",

    "the exponent @xmath22 is chosen such that the electron - electron repulsion energy due to two such charge distributions on atomic - site @xmath18 equals the difference between the atomic electronic affinity and ionization potential @xmath23  @xcite , which incorporates implicitly the short - range on - site electron - electron interaction effect . in this way",

    "[ xuefig16 ] for both junctions . for electrostatic potential models 2 and 3 ,",
    "the i - v characteristics are obtained by superposing the assumed electrostatic potential profile onto the hamiltonian of the equilibrium junction and evaluating its matrix element by direct numerical integration .",
    "we find that as the length of swnt increases , the three different models of electrostatic potential response lead to qualitatively different current - voltage characteristics in both the magnitude of the current and its voltage dependence .",
    "this is because current transport is dominated by thermal - activation contribution for all the swnt molecules investigated except the shortest ones . for the au - swnt - au junction",
    ", we find that potential models 2 and 3 give qualitatively similar i - v characteristics , indicating that potential drop within the swnt bulk is important .",
    "but for the ti - swnt - ti junction , we find that potential models 1 and 3 give qualitatively similar i - v characteristics for swnts longer than @xmath144 , indicating instead that potential drop across the metal - swnt interface is important .",
    "the contact dependence of the source / drain field effect can also be seen more clearly by analyzing its effect on the swnt electronic structure from fig .",
    "[ xuefig17 ] , where we show the three - dimensional plot of the ldos of the swnt within the au - swnt - au and ti - swnt - ti junctions at applied bias voltage of @xmath142 and assuming potential model 3 .",
    "since for the equilibrium swnt junction , the potential variation is appreciable over a length scale comparable to half of the swnt length and up to @xmath145 , both the magnitude and the voltage - dependence of the current will be sensitive to the spatial variation of the potential response to the applied voltage over the same length scale , which may have different effects on the swnt band structure depending on the metallic electrodes used ( fig . [ xuefig17 ] ) .",
    "therefore accurate modeling of this long - range potential variation at the metal - swnt interface will be critical for evaluating the current - transport mechanism of the nanoscale swnt devices .",
    "the rapid development of single - wall carbon nanotube - based device technology presents opportunities both for exploring novel device concepts based on atomic - scale nanoengineering techniques and for examining the physical principles of nanoelectronics from the bottom - up atomistic approach . as the first example of the device physics problems raised in this context , we examine electron transport through metal - swnt interface when the finite swnt is contacted to the metal surfaces through the dangling bonds at the end , which presents an atomic - scale analogue to the planar metal - semiconductor interface . due to the quasi - one - dimensional geometry of the swnts ,",
    "a correct understanding of the physical mechanisms involved requires an atomistic analysis of the electronic processes in the configuration of the metal - swnt - metal junctions .",
    "we have presented in this paper such a microscopic study of electronic and transport properties of metal - swnt interfaces , as the length of the finite swnt varies from the molecular limit to the bulk limit and the strength of the interface coupling varies from the strong coupling to the weak coupling limit .",
    "our models are based on a self - consistent tight - binding implementation of the recently developed self - consistent matrix green s function ( scmgf ) approach for modeling molecular electronic devices , which includes atomistic description of the swnt electronic structure , the three - dimensional electrostatics of the metal - swnt interface and is applicable to arbitrary nanostructured devices within the coherent transport regime .",
    "we present a bottom - up analysis of the nature of the schottky barrier formation , the length and temperature dependence of electron transport through the metal - swnt interfaces , which show quite different behavior compared to the planar metal - semiconductor interfaces , due to the confined cylindrical geometry and the finite number of conduction channels within the swnt junctions .",
    "we find that the current - voltage characteristics of the metal - swnt - metal junctions depend sensitively on the electrostatic potential profiles across the swnt junction , which indicates the importance of the self - consistent modeling of the long - range potential variation at the metal - swnt interface for quantitative evaluation of device characteristics .",
    "much of current interests on the schottky barrier effect at metal - swnt interface are stimulated by the controversial role it plays in the operation of carbon nanotube field - effect transistors ( cntfet ) ,  @xcite where different contact schemes and metallic electrodes have been used .",
    "in general , the operation of cntfet will be determined by the combined gate and source / drain voltage effect on the schottky barrier shape at the metal - swnt interface , which may depend on the details of the metal - swnt contact geometry , nanotube diameter / chirality and temperature / voltage range . correspondingly , an atomic - scale understanding of the gate modulation effect within the metal - insulator - swnt capacitor configuration will also be needed , similar to the planar metal - oxide - semiconductor structure .",
    "@xcite we believe that detailed knowledges of the electronic processes within both the metal - swnt - metal junction and the metal - insulator - swnt capacitor are needed before a clear and unambiguous picture on the physical principles governing the operation of cntfet can emerge .",
    "in particular , preliminary theoretical results on the carbon - nanotube field - effect transistors show that for swnt molecule end - contacted to the electrodes , the nanotube transistor functions through the gate modulation of the schottky barrier at the metal - swnt interface ( in agreement with recent experiments ,  @xcite ) which becomes more effective as the length of the swnt molecule increases .",
    "further analysis is thus needed that treat both the gate and source / drain field self - consistently within the swnt junctions , to achieve a thorough understanding of swnt - based nanoelectronic devices .",

    "<S> we present a scaling analysis of electronic and transport properties of metal - semiconducting carbon nanotube interfaces as a function of the nanotube length within the coherent transport regime , which takes fully into account atomic - scale electronic structure and three - dimensional electrostatics of the metal - nanotube interface using a real - space green s function based self - consistent tight - binding theory . as the first example </S>",
    "<S> , we examine devices formed by attaching finite - size single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) to both high- and low- work function metallic electrodes through the dangling bonds at the end , where the length of the swnt molecule varies from the molecular limit to the bulk limit and the strength of metal - swnt coupling varies from the strong coupling to the weak coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the nature of schottky barrier formation at the metal - nanotube interface by examining the electrostatics , the band lineup and the conductance of the metal - swnt molecule - metal junction as a function of the swnt molecule length and metal - swnt coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the confined cylindrical geometry and the atomistic nature of electronic processes across the metal - swnt interface leads to a different physical picture of band alignment from that of the planar metal - semiconductor interface . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the temperature and length dependence of the conductance of the swnt junctions , which shows a transition from tunneling- to thermal activation - dominated transport with increasing nanotube length . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the conductance is much weaker than that of the planar metal - semiconductor interface due to the finite number of conduction channels within the swnt junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the current - voltage characteristics of the metal - swnt molecule - metal junctions are sensitive to models of the potential response to the applied source / drain bias voltages . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis applies in general to devices based on quasi - one - dimensional nanostructures including molecules , carbon nanotubes and semiconductor nanowires . </S>"
