    "quantum entanglement is one of the important nonclassical features of quantum mechanics . in recent decades , it is rediscovered as a crucial resource in quantum information processing , such as quantum communication and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is a fundamental problem to characterize entanglement property of quantum systems . till now , although the entanglement in bipartite systems is well understood in many aspects , the corresponding property in multipartite systems is far from clear , even for three - qubit quantum states @xcite .    in three - qubit pure states ,",
    "the two - qubit and genuine three - qubit entanglement can be quantified by the concurrences @xcite and the three - tangle @xcite , respectively , which constitute a good hierarchy structure for the entanglement characterization . however , for three - qubit mixed states , the case is much more complicated and different .",
    "et al _ analyzed the entanglement property of a three - qubit mixed state composed of a ghz state and a w state @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that , in some region of the mix probability , the mixed state is entangled but there is no concurrence and three - tangle . compared with the entanglement in pure states ,",
    "this is a new type of entangled state which exhibits in the qubit - block form .",
    "furthermore , based on a purification scenario , it is elaborated that the entanglement actually comes from the genuine multipartite entanglement between the system and its environment @xcite .",
    "however , for a deep understanding on the three - qubit entanglement , it is desirable to further investigate the entanglement property in the mixed states and compare it with that of pure states .",
    "entanglement dynamical property is very important in practical quantum information processing .",
    "this is because that entanglement always decays due to the unwanted interaction between the system and its environment .",
    "theoretical studies have revealed that entanglement does not always decay in an asymptotic way and it can disappear in a finite time , which is referred to as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite and has been detected in photon and atom systems experimentally @xcite ( see also a review paper @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "recently , lopez _ et al _ analyzed the entanglement dynamics of two cavities interacting with independent reservoirs @xcite .",
    "they showed that when the cavity entanglement experiences the esd phenomenon , the reservoir entanglement suddenly and necessarily appears .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the entanglement evolution is restricted by a monogamy relation and the genuine multipartite entanglement is involved in the dynamical procedure @xcite .",
    "however , these papers only addressed the evolution with bipartite initial states , and the case of multipartite initial states is awaited for further studies . in three - qubit mixed states ,",
    "the qubit - block entanglement @xcite is a new kind of entanglement type and its dynamical property is yet to be considered .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the entanglement dynamical property of a class of three - qubit mixed states composed of a ghz state and a w state . for a composite system consisting of three cavities with independent reservoirs ,",
    "we first show that the entanglement evolution obeys a set of monogamy relations .",
    "then , we investigate the entanglement evolution of three cavity photons , which can exhibit the esd property . this property is further compared with that of a generalized ghz state .",
    "finally , we discuss the entanglement distribution in the multipartite system and give the relation of entanglement between the cavity photons and the reservoirs .",
    "before deriving the monogamy relation in the dynamical evolution , we first introduce the cavity - reservoir system . the interaction between a single cavity and its n - mode reservoir",
    "is characterized by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath0 when a cavity mode is containing a single photon and its corresponding reservoir is in the vacuum state , the quantum state is @xmath1 , in which @xmath2 . in the limit of @xmath3 ,",
    "the dynamical evolution given by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 1 ) leads to the output state @xmath4 where @xmath5 with the amplitude converging to @xmath6^{1/2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , the cavity and reservoir evolve as an effective two - qubit system .",
    "we consider three cavities being affected by the dissipation of three independent reservoirs .",
    "the initial state of three cavity photons and the corresponding reservoirs is @xmath7 where the reservoirs are in the vacuum state and the cavity photons are in the new type of entangled state @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . in order to obtain conveniently the output state of the multipartite cavity - reservoir systems",
    ", we induce an ancillary qubit @xmath11 which can purify the input state in eq .",
    "so , the global initial state is @xmath12 under the time evolution , the global output state has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for the three cavity - reservoir system , its output state is @xmath17    in many - body quantum systems , entanglement is monogamous , which means that entanglement can not be freely shared among many parties . for a three - qubit state @xmath18 , coffman _",
    "et al _ prove the relation @xcite @xmath19 where the concurrence @xmath20 $ ] quantifies the bipartite entanglement in the partition @xmath21 ( the minimum runs over all the pure state decompositions of @xmath18 ) and the concurrence @xmath22 quantifies the two - qubit entanglement which is defined as @xmath23 with the decreasing nonnegative real numbers @xmath24 being the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the monogamy relation in eq .",
    "( 8) is further generalized to the @xmath26-qubit quantum state , which has the form @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the two - qubit partition @xmath28 , a set of monogamy relations are also proved in the ref .",
    "but , these relations are mainly focused on the distribution of two - qubit entanglement , the monogamy relation for multiqubit entanglement is still awaited for further study .    in the dissipative procedure of the multipartite cavity - reservoir systems , we can derive the following relations    @xmath29    where the concurrence @xmath30 and the negativity @xmath31 @xcite quantify the bipartite entanglement in different multi - qubit quantum systems .",
    "( 9a ) , we use the property that entanglement is invariant under local unitary ( lu ) operations and consider the tensor product structure of the dynamical evolution @xmath32 . in eq .",
    "( 9b ) , we use the monogamy relation of three - qubit quantum states , where the subsystem @xmath33 can be regarded as a logic qubit . in eq .",
    "( 9c ) , we use the property that entanglement does not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , and we trace out the subsystems @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . in eq .",
    "( 9d ) , we use the relation @xmath36 @xcite , in which the negativity is defined as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the partial transpose with respect to the subsystem @xmath39 , and the norm is @xmath40 .    according to eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we know that the initial entanglement between the cavity photon @xmath41 and the other photons @xmath42 plus the ancillary system @xmath11 restricts the entanglement evolution in the multipartite cavity - reservoir systems .",
    "this entanglement is not less than the sum of concurrences @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , this equation gives hierarchy relations of entanglement in three cavity photons and three reservoirs .",
    "about the set of monogamy relations , we want to point out two points .",
    "the first one is that the monogamy relations are not limited by the initial state in eq .",
    "( 5 ) and they are satisfied only if the initial cavity photons are in a three - qubit quantum state and the reservoirs in the vacuum state .",
    "the second one is that the relation @xmath45 is satisfied in the dynamical procedure , however , the similar monogamy relations in eq . (",
    "9 ) do not hold in general .",
    "the concurrence for multiqubit mixed states is difficult to compute , because its solution requires to run over all the pure state decomposition and take the minimum .",
    "compared with the concurrence , the negativity is computable and we will use this measure to analyze the entanglement evolution in the multipartite cavity - reservoir systems .",
    "in the multipartite cavity - reservoir system , the initial state of the three cavity photons is the mixed state composed of a ghz state and a w state as shown in eq .",
    "this quantum state has special entanglement property that , in certain region of the mix probability , it is entangled but the entanglement can not be explained as the two- qubit concurrences and the three - qubit tangle @xcite .",
    "it has a new type of entanglement structure and can exhibit in the qubit - block form @xcite . in the following",
    "we will first analyze its entanglement evolution property in the multipartite cavity - reservoir system , and then compare it with a generalized ghz state .    in the dissipative environment",
    ", the output state of the three cavity photons can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the global evolution state given in eq .",
    "we use negativity to characterize the entanglement evolution in the dynamical procedure . for the output state of cavity photons ,",
    "its negativity is @xmath48=||\\rho^{t_{c_1}}(t)||-1=\\sum_i |\\lambda_i(t)|-1,\\ ] ] where @xmath49s are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath50 . in the time evolution , the entanglement degradation of cavity photons has two kinds of routes , one is the asymptotic way , the other is the esd way .",
    "the entanglement is nonzero when at least one eigenvalues is negative , and it is zero when all the eigenvalues are nonnegative . after some calculation , we can obtain the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath51 , which can be expressed as @xmath52\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_{5 } & = & \\frac{1}{12}[a_{1}-e^{-3\\kappa t}\\sqrt{a_{2}}],\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_{6 } & = & \\frac{1}{12}[a_{1}+e^{-3\\kappa t}\\sqrt{a_{2}}],\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_{7 } & = & \\frac{1}{12}[b_{1}-e^{-2\\kappa t}\\sqrt{b_{2}}],\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_{8 } & = & \\frac{1}{12}[b_{1}+e^{-2\\kappa t}\\sqrt{b_{2}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath53 is the mix probability of the ghz and w states , @xmath54 represents the time evolution ( @xmath55 is the dissipative constant ) , and the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 have the forms @xmath60,\\nonumber\\\\ b_{2}&=&36[e^{4\\kappa t}+p^{2}-e^{3\\kappa t}(p+2)-e^{\\kappa t}p(p+2 ) ] \\nonumber\\\\        & & + e^{2\\kappa t}(68 + 44p+41p^{2})\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the eight eigenvalues , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are always nonnegative , because they can be written as the product or sum of some nonnegative terms . the eigenvalues @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be negative , and they are served as the indicators of the evolution routes .",
    "set @xmath69 , we can solve the relation between the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which can be written as @xmath70 for a given value of the parameter @xmath53 , @xmath71 when the time @xmath72 , and @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "set @xmath75 , we can obtain the relation @xmath76 where the parameter @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , given a value of @xmath53 , @xmath78 when @xmath79 , and @xmath80 when @xmath74 .    in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the mix probability @xmath53 as a function of the time evolution @xmath54 when @xmath69 and @xmath75 , respectively .",

    "therefore , the entanglement evolution experiences the esd for which the corresponding mixed probability @xmath53 ranges in @xmath85 .",
    "the first esd time occurs at @xmath86 and the probability @xmath87 . on the other hand ,",
    "the entanglement evolution is asymptotic when the probabilities @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    in fig.2",

    "when @xmath93 , the entanglement decays in the esd way except for @xmath89 .",
    "the minimum of the initial entanglement ( @xmath94 ) is located at @xmath95 , however , its esd time is not the least and the minimum of the esd time corresponds to the value @xmath87 . when @xmath89 , the initial state is the ghz state ( @xmath96 ) and its evolution is asymptotic .",
    "the three cavity photons are initially in the mixed state composed of a ghz state and a w state whose entanglement structure is quite different from that of pure states .",
