    "when studying disordered systems at or near their critical points , the notion of a single scaling dimension governing the behaviour of an observable field at large distances becomes inadequate .",
    "randomness gives rise to a broad probability distribution for the scaling dimension of a two - point correlation function @xmath2 , so the quenched average of @xmath3 moments of the two - point function will have a non - linear dependence on @xmath4 : @xmath5 where the over - bar indicates the average over quenched disorder .",
    "such multiscaling behaviour has been both predicted analytically and observed numerically in a wide range of systems , but we will primarily concern ourselves with the random - bond @xmath0-state potts model in 2d ( the random - bond ising model in @xmath1 dimensions is briefly considered in section [ ssec : ising ] ) . for @xmath0 near 2 , the critical behaviour of this system is obtainable via an @xmath6-expansion about the pure ising - model fixed point , with an expansion parameter proportional to the specific heat exponent @xmath7 .",
    "( we recall the harris criterion @xcite , which states that bond randomness will be relevant if and only if the specific heat exponent is positive : hence the disorder is marginal for the ising model ( @xmath0=2 ) and relevant for all @xmath0 greater than this value ) . following initial work by ludwig @xcite , multiscaling behaviour of moments of the two - point spin - spin correlation function has been well established in this model both theoretically and numerically ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and multiscaling in the corrections to scaling for the energy - energy correlator has been predicted .",
    "( the energy - sector calculation is complicated by the fact that scaling operators correspond to irreducible representations of the permutation group of replica indices , @xmath8 ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine some further structure induced by the disorder , which shows up as correlations between the two - point spin / spin and energy / energy functions .",
    "( in fact , the non - trivial replica structure of the energy sector means that a distinction must be made between the connected and disconnected two - point energy correlators : these may have different behaviour with the spin / spin function , and also be mutually correlated ) .",
    "for example , does @xmath9 or is a more complex behaviour to be expected ? we show that this is dependent on both the model in question , and whether the connected or full @xmath10 correlator is taken .",
    "in section [ sec : intro ] we shall introduce the @xmath0-state potts model and the replica method used to carry out the average over quenched disorder , before describing results already obtained for this model .",
    "in section [ ssec : energy ] we present calculations of scaling dimensions ( to one loop ) of moments of the energy - operator , and then show ( section [ ssec : mixed])that a non - trivial behaviour of the mixed spin - energy moments is to be expected .",
    "this indicates that the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 should be considered as being drawn from a joint probability distribution function that is not equal to the product of the individual marginal distributions , i.e. , the two quantities are not statistically independent .",
    "we then make contact with quantities available via numerical calculations , by expressing two - point functions of the irrep scaling operators as linear combinations of various quenched averaged energy correlation functions ( section [ ssec : rstruc ] ) .",
    "finally we describe a similar calculation for the random - bond ising model in @xmath1 dimensions ( section [ ssec : ising ] ) .",
    "we write the reduced lattice hamiltonian for the @xmath0-state potts model with weak bond disorder as    @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the potts spin variables , @xmath15 is the average bond strength and @xmath16 are the local fluctuations about @xmath15 , assumed to be completely uncorrelated .",
    "the sum is taken over all nearest - neighbour pairs . taking the local energy density @xmath17 and using replicas to average over the disorder , we end up with an effective hamiltonian in terms of @xmath4 replicas of the system coupled together .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is large , and take the @xmath18 limit to perform the quenched average at the end of the calculation ( see @xcite or @xcite for an overview of the replica method in field - theoretic calculations ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the reduced hamiltonian for the critical pure potts model , @xmath21 is the reduced temperature @xmath22 and @xmath23 is proportional to the second cumulant of the distribution for disorder ( power - counting arguments show that higher cumulants are irrelevant at the pure fixed point for @xmath0 near 2 ) .",
    "we note further that the expectation value of @xmath24 only shifts the critical temperature and cumulants , without affecting the critical exponents in any way , so we can write @xmath25 and absorb the first term into the definitions of the other parameters .",
    "also , terms with @xmath26 in the double sum can also be neglected since they are either irrelevant by power - counting or yield disconnected diagrams which do not contribute to the renormalisation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) . finally , moving to the continuum limit , we find    @xmath27 correlation functions calculated against this effective , ` replicated ' hamiltonian will correspond to correlators averaged against the initial hamiltonian with quenched disorder : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 label the replicas the operators are lying in .",
    "note that it is assumed that the above correlators are independent of which replicas are actually taken  this is the assumption of replica symmetry , which appears to be valid for weakly disordered ferromagnets .",
    "the quenched average of @xmath31 moments of the spin operator was calculated by ludwig for all @xmath32 , to one loop .",
    "the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath33 was found to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scaling dimension of the spin operator at the pure fixed point and @xmath36 is the rg eigenvalue of @xmath23 , vanishing proportional to @xmath37 . for typical realisations of disorder ,",
    "the behaviour of the two - point function at large @xmath38 is governed by a multifractal exponent ( c.f .",
    "this is given by the saddle point of the legendre transformation of @xmath39 , and was found to be @xmath40    in general a given moment of the energy operators does not have a pure scaling behaviour . in the replica formalism ,",
    "our perturbing operator @xmath41 is a singlet under the group of permutations of the replica indices , @xmath8 ( in this context the permutation group is often named the ` replica ' group instead ) . thus scaling dimensions of operators",
    "will only necessarily be constant on subspaces of operators corresponding to irreducible representations ( irreps ) of @xmath8 .",
    "degeneracies between irreps may arise  in fact all irreps of moments of the spin operator are degenerate , due to their different fusion rules with the perturbing operator  but in general a given operator @xmath42 will have a ` sum - of - powers ' scaling behaviour @xmath43 where @xmath44 runs over the different irreps of @xmath8 present in the decomposition of @xmath42 .",
    "calculations for @xmath45 were given in @xcite .",
    "in each case the most antisymmetric irrep was the most relevant , and the scaling dimensions of these most relevant irreps were linear in @xmath46 , suggesting no multiscaling behaviour to this order .",
    "a more complex structure was however present in the corrections to scaling .",
    "first we shall exploit the connection between the irreps .  of @xmath48 and @xmath47 to obtain complete sets of scaling dimensions for moments of the energy - energy correlation function , @xmath49 , to one loop . at this order ,",
    "the effect of a shift in the short - distance cutoff on the couplings is most easily treated in terms of the operator product expansion ( ope ) ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consider a general partition function @xmath50 for a critical hamiltonian @xmath51 , perturbed by a set of scaling fields @xmath52 with corresponding couplings @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the microscopic cutoff . the couplings flow ( to first order ) as @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the ope coefficients @xmath58    before the randomness is introduced , the operators @xmath59 with @xmath46 distinct replica labels are degenerate .",
    "we need to calculate the ope coefficients of the disorder operator @xmath60 within this subspace . in @xmath47 language",
    "let us denote the presence of an energy operator in replica @xmath29 by @xmath61 and its absence by @xmath62 .",
    "we can write a general operator by the action of a series of @xmath47 raising operators on a ` vacuum ' @xmath63 : @xmath64 in the subspace corresponding to the energy sector , the ope of one of these operators with the disorder operator @xmath65 is equivalent to the action of the matrix @xmath66 on the corresponding state , with @xmath67=0 $ ] as we would expect .",
    "( the extra factor of two arises from the two different ways of performing the operator contraction ) .",
    "if we define the total spin vector @xmath68 then we can write @xmath69 using @xmath70 we can thus write @xmath71 however , we now have the problem of interpreting the total spin angular momentum @xmath72 .",
    "one solution is to ask which values of @xmath72 are consistent with the known value of @xmath73  clearly , the possible values are @xmath74 we can support this by comparing the irreducible representations of @xmath47 with the irreducible representations of @xmath8 considered by ludwig . in the @xmath8 case , we have to consider the representations given by all young tableaux of @xmath4 boxes and at most two rows , with up to @xmath46 boxes in the second row .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 the possible irreps are @xcite    ( 93,35 ) ( 0,15.5)(15.5,0)2(15,15)@xmath77 ( 31,15.5)(15.5,0)4(15,15 )     ( 77.5,35 ) ( 0,15.5)(15.5,0)2(15,15)@xmath77 ( 31,15.5)(15.5,0)3(15,15 )   ( 0,0)(15,15 )     ( 62,35 ) ( 0,15.5)(15.5,0)2(15,15)@xmath77 ( 31,15.5)(15.5,0)2(15,15 )   ( 0,0)(15.5,0)2(15,15 )     these irreps can be placed in one - to - one correspondence with the representations formed by the tensor product of @xmath4 spin - half representations of @xmath47 with precisely @xmath46 of them spin - up .",
    "of these latter tableaux , a tableau with @xmath78 boxes in the first row and @xmath38 boxes in the second row has a dimensionality of @xmath79 corresponding to a total spin of @xmath80 , as was proposed by the consistency condition .",
    "hence , in general the @xmath81 moment of the energy operator will have a series of irreps @xmath82 with scaling dimensions @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath36 is the rg eigenvalue of the coupling to disorder and @xmath85 is the scaling dimension of the energy operator at the pure fixed point , @xmath86 the factor of @xmath87 arises from the position of the disordered fixed point , set ( to one loop ) by @xmath88    after taking the @xmath89 limit we obtain @xmath90 the most relevant scaling dimension belongs to the most antisymmetric irrep @xmath91 and has a linear dependence on @xmath46 . note that the irreps @xmath92 and @xmath93 are always degenerate at @xmath94 .",
    "this must happen because for @xmath95 they have degeneracies 1 and @xmath96 respectively , while as @xmath97 all operators must arrange themselves to have degeneracies @xmath98 , so that the torus partition function is @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , this collision of the scaling dimensions at @xmath94 will give rise to a logarithmic operator @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath100 span a vector space of dimension @xmath101 . in general , a young tableaux of shape @xmath102 $ ] corresponds to a vector space of dimensionality @xmath103 , and it can be shown that the sets of permitted irreps ( @xmath104 $ ] ) exhaust this vector space .",
    "the dimensionality of a given irrep does not depend on the number of energy operators in the tableau , and is preserved under the addition of extra @xmath77-operators via @xmath105  irreps related via the action of @xmath106 are joined in the plot below ( figure [ fig : energyspec ] ) :     moments of the energy operator to one loop at @xmath107,width=377,height=302 ]    the two - point function of the most antisymmetric irrep for a given @xmath46 , @xmath91 , corresponds to the quenched average of the @xmath81 moment of the connected correlation function , @xmath108 this can be seen by noting that the state corresponding to the operator @xmath109 is annihilated by the step - down operator @xmath110 : @xmath111 all @xmath112 with @xmath113 give zero when acting on everything to their right , so we only need consider those @xmath112 with @xmath114 .",
    "take the terms of the step - down operator in pairs : the first pair @xmath115 will act on everything to the right to give @xmath116 the action of all other pairs similarly vanishes , so the state corresponding to the connected correlation function is annihilated by @xmath117 and is therefore also the state corresponding to the most antisymmetric irrep .",
    "we now wish to consider the behaviour of cross - moments , i.e. , investigate the renormalisation of the operators @xmath118 .",
    "fortunately , given the behaviour of the @xmath100 operators considered above this is not a particularly difficult extension . to one loop",
    ", we again consider the effect of the disorder operator @xmath119 on the operator @xmath120 , and look for operators of the same form to be produced by all possible contractions .",
    "these contractions are given by the fusion rules of our theory at the pure fixed point :",
    "@xmath121    contractions are only possible within a given replica . given the fusion rules , at this order there are only two possibilities :    1 .",
    "@xmath122 : one of the energy operators in the disorder operator contracts against another energy operator @xmath123 , the other lies in an ` empty ' replica .",
    "this gives the same behaviour as in the pure energy sector , but with a shift in the effective number of replica indices : @xmath124 2 .",
    "@xmath125 : both energy operators in the disorder operator contract with spin operators , giving rise to further spin operators .",
    "as considered by ludwig , this gives rise to a term @xmath126    any other attempted contractions will evaluate to zero when the the trace over the fields is taken . substituting these changes into our expression for the energy sector , after taking the @xmath97 limit we find @xmath127+o(y^2)\\ ] ] where as before @xmath128 $ ] and @xmath35 is the scaling dimensions of the spin operator at the pure fixed point .",
    "the spin operators exclude the energy operators from their replicas , giving rise to an effective shift in the number of replicas @xmath129 .",
    "the scaling dimensions of the most antisymmetric irreps @xmath130 are unaffected by this exclusion process , as they have no @xmath4-dependence .",
    "this means that , to one loop , there will be no extra structure in the quenched average @xmath131 . in section [ ssec : ising",
    "] , however , we shall demonstrate that this quantity does have extra structure for the case of the random - bond ising model in @xmath132 dimensions .    by analogy with the @xmath47 argument",
    ", it is possible to consider the mixed sector by writing our operators @xmath133 as a fundamental representation of @xmath134 .",
    "this analysis leads to the same results , as the @xmath135 @xmath47 subgroup effectively decouples from the spin operator .    as one check on these results , standard arguments in probability theory ( see , e.g.,@xcite )",
    "require that @xmath136 should be convex for all increases in @xmath32 or @xmath46 , both individually and jointly .",
    "considering the second derivatives of this quantity w.r.t . @xmath32 and @xmath46",
    ", this requirement can be seen to be trivially satisfied for @xmath137 .",
    "given that non - trivial structure in the spin - energy sector only appears to sub - leading order , it is useful to be able to write two - point functions of irreducible representations of the replica group in terms of numerically available quantities .",
    "we have already noted that the most relevant , most antisymmetric irreps correspond to moments of the connected part of the two - point correlation function ( section [ ssec : mixed ] ) and would like to be able to say something similar for a general irrep . in appendix",
    "a we detail the combinatorics needed to decompose a two - point function of irreps into a linear combination of various other two - point functions : here we shall merely note a few results .",
    "we find explicitly that the most antisymmetric irrep at a given @xmath46 , @xmath91 has a two - point function @xmath138    in the @xmath139 case , both the possible irreps @xmath140 and @xmath141 correspond to the connected correlator @xmath142 .",
    "this is in fact a general feature , since the lowest two irreps for arbitrary @xmath46 are always degenerate after taking the @xmath97 limit .    as an example of a correlation function which has a non - trivial behaviour on addition of @xmath32 spin - spin correlators , the irrep @xmath143 is a non - leading irrep which can be written as @xmath144 if we take a factor of @xmath145 inside each quenched average on the rhs , the resulting scaling dimension will be @xmath146 thus this correlation function directly exhibits the cross - structure between the two - point function of the spin operator and the full two - point function of the energy operator .",
    "as an alternative to perturbing the pure ising model by changing the number of possible values for the spin , we can consider the ising model in @xmath132 dimensions .",
    "the specific heat exponent @xmath7 is zero at @xmath147 and small for @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) , so we shall assume that @xmath150 with @xmath151 .",
    "the bond disorder is relevant for all @xmath152 , and we assume that the system will flow to a nearby disordered fixed point .",
    "the calculation of scaling dimensions at this fixed point is very similar to that for the disordered potts model  the only difference is that the ope rules are altered to @xmath153 the ope coefficient @xmath154 is zero for @xmath147 due to the self - duality of the ising model in two dimensions @xcite , but non - zero for @xmath155 . repeating the analysis of section [ ssec : mixed ]",
    "we can obtain two more types of contraction between the disorder operator @xmath156 and @xmath157 :    1 .",
    "both energy operators in the disorder operator contract with energy operators , giving rise to two further energy operators in the same replicas .",
    "this gives a term @xmath158 .",
    "2 .   the disorder operator contracts with one energy operator and one spin operator , giving rise to one operator of each type with unchanged replica indices . this produces a term @xmath159 .",
    "the non - zero @xmath154 will shift the position of the fixed points , via the rg equation for the disorder",

    "to one loop , the interaction between the spin and energy operators is an ` exclusion effect ' : the spin operators block replicas , shifting the @xmath4-dependence of the scaling dimensions of the different irreps in the energy sector . for the potts model",
    "this does not have any effect on the leading behaviour , as the most relevant irrep irrep @xmath130 has a scaling dimension with no @xmath4-dependence .",
    "the sub - leading terms are affected , however , and this may be picked up in numerical studies . by writing the irreps in terms of correlation functions",
    "we have shown how linear combinations of correlators could be used to demonstrate the existence of an underlying joint distribution function for the quenched average of spin / spin and energy / energy moments . in the ising model in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "the leading behaviour of mixed moments is affected non - trivially .",
    "also , three- or higher- point functions should also exhibit this cross - sector behaviour , presumably with selection rules coming from the group structure of the energy sector .",
    "there remains the question of what happens when these calculations are continued to two loops .",
    "_ a priori _ , there seems no reason to expect that the scaling dimensions of the most antisymmetric irreps will continue to be protected against corrections from cross - correlations between the spin and energy two - point functions .",
    "we will content ourselves here with noting that a coulomb - gas calculation along the lines of @xcite would give two - loop corrections to the scaling dimensions of the operator @xmath164 proportional to @xmath165 which we would expect to be non - zero , although a detailed calculation would of course be necessary to confirm this .",
    "after this work was substantially completed , we heard of work by jeng and ludwig@xcite who , in the course of their investigation of random defect lines in 2d systems , also derived ( by an alternative method ) the scaling dimensions of moments of the energy operator , to two - loop order .",
