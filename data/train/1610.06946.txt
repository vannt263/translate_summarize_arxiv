    "_ recursive distributional equations _ ( rdes ) and the associated _ recursive tree processes _ ( rtps ) occur in various problems , mainly related to branching processes , random geometry , statistical physics and combinatorial optimization , as also probabilistic analysis of algorithms .",
    "we briefly recall here some generalities , referring the reader to the excellent survey  @xcite for more details .",
    "informally speaking , recursive tree processes are analogues of markov processes , but with each value `` taking as input '' several `` preceding '' values , forming thus a tree of dependences ( whence the name ) .",
    "more precisely , a rtp is a rooted tree @xmath1 of random variables @xmath2 , where at each vertex @xmath3 the value @xmath4 is related to the values @xmath5 s at its children and to the random variable  @xmath6 via a given function @xmath7 : @xmath8 in addition , natural independence conditions on @xmath4 s and @xmath6 s are required .",
    "we give the precise definition below , see  [ par : irtp ] .",
    "now , assume that the laws of all the @xmath6 s are given according to the same probability measure  @xmath9 ( this assumption will stand throughout the whole paper ) .",
    "then it is natural to ask whether the laws of all the  @xmath4 s coincide , too .",
    "if this is the case , the rtp is called _ invariant _ , and the law of  @xmath4 is a solution to the rde defined by the function @xmath7 : @xmath10    given an invariant rtp , it is highly interesting to find out whether the values of the @xmath4 s are ( almost surely ) defined by the random environment @xmath11 , that is , whether the conditional distribution of the @xmath12 s given the @xmath13 s is almost surely a dirac measure .",
    "if this is the case , according to aldous and bandyopadhyay @xcite , the rtp is called  _ endogenous_.    even existence of invariant rtps ( or ,",
    "what is the same , existence of a solution to a rde ) is a difficult question in general .",
    "we again refer the reader to  @xcite for an overview of known methods ( among which , the most widely used are monotonicity for the compact case and contraction in more general settings ) .    in  @xcite , in collaboration with m.  khristoforov , we have proposed a _ cut - off method _ to construct _ solutions _ of monotone rdes in a non - compact setting .",
    "we have applied this method in the particular case of random metrics associated with multiplicative cascades on hierarchical graphs ( we recall the details below , in   [ s : background ] ) . moreover ,",
    "the method is sufficiently flexible to be applied to other situations ( for instance , @xmath14-type rdes with some additional conditions imposed ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the cut - off method can be modified also to prove _ endogeny _ of certain rtps . as a first explicit example , we establish endogeny of the tree processes associated with random metrics defined via multiplicative cascades on non - pivotal hierarchical graphs .",
    "this has as rather reassuring consequence that the random metric spaces that were defined in  @xcite are measurable functions of the cascade ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the moment",
    ", we state our main theorem with a `` black box '' of assumptions , postponing the listing till  [ s : assumptions ] :    [ t : main ]",
    "suppose that the law @xmath9 and the relation function @xmath7 satisfy assumptions  [ a : incr][a : superexp ] , listed in ",
    "[ s : assumptions ] , and let  @xmath15 be a solution to the corresponding rde . then the invariant rtp associated with @xmath15 is endogenous .",
    "its applicability for the multiplicative cascades on non - pivotal hierarchical graphs is guaranteed by the second theorem :    [ t : applying ] assumptions  [ a : incr][a : superexp ] are satisfied for the rdes corresponding to random metrics associated with multiplicative cascades on non - pivotal hierarchical graphs with a gaussian measure  @xmath9 ( that is , with the log - normal random rescaling law ) .    as in  (",
    "* , rem .",
    "2 ) , the statement of theorem  [ t : applying ] holds also provided that the measure  @xmath9 is absolutely continuous with everywhere positive continuous density and has normal tails at @xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , different approaches by cut - off have been used to find solutions to the rdes that are associated with problems of mean - field combinatorial optimization ( see section [ s : general ] , as well as @xcite , @xcite ) : the mean - field approximation for minimal matching in pseudo - dimension @xmath17 @xcite , and for the minimum weight @xmath18-factor problem , which corresponds to the mean - field travelling salesman problem when @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "for the latter , we point out that @xcite makes no use of cut - off to show existence of the solution , although many ideas are in the spirit of @xcite , when proving that the solution is a global attractor . relying on these works",
    ", we apply our main result to show the endogeny . for the minimal",
    "matching , the case @xmath20 was already solved in @xcite ; here we use the results in @xcite to treat the problem of pseudo - dimension @xmath0 .",
