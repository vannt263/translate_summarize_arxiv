    "in addition to the mass , metallicity is one of the few progenitor attributes that can leave an imprint on the observational properties of snia by affecting the synthesized mass of @xmath0ni , with important consequences for their use as cosmological standard candles . up to now , attempts to measure @xmath6 directly from supernova observations have been scarce and their results uncertain @xcite .",
    "measuring @xmath6 from the x - ray emission of supernova remnants is a promising alternative but as yet has been only applied to a single supernova @xcite .",
    "an alternative venue is to estimate the supernova metallicity as the mean @xmath6 of its environment @xcite .",
    "@xcite looked for galactic age or metal content correlations with snia luminosity , but their results were ambiguous .",
    "@xcite looked for systematic trends of snia uv spectra with metallicity of the host galaxy , and found that the spectral variations were much larger than predicted by theoretical models .",
    "@xcite , using data from the sloan digital sky survey and supernova survey concluded that prompt snia are more luminous in metal - poor systems .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g08 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h09 ) , using different methodologies to estimate the metallicity of snia hosts , arrived to opposite conclusions with respect to the dependence of supernova luminosity on @xmath6 .",
    "there is a long history of numerical simulations of snia aimed at predicting the impact of metallicity and explosive neutronization on their yields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dhs01 ) found that the offset in the calibration of supernova magnitudes vs light curve ( lc ) widths is not monotonic in @xmath6 and remains smaller than @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the width - luminosity relationship depends weakly on the metallicity of the progenitor . from an analytical point of view , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tbt03 ) using arguments from basic nuclear physics predicted a linear relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the conclusions of tbt03 relied on two main assumptions : first , that most of the @xmath0ni is synthesized in material that burns fully to nse and , second , that a fiducial snia produces a mass @xmath9  m@xmath3 of fe - group nuclei whose @xmath5 is not modified during the explosion . @xcite and @xcite , based on the same assumptions as tbt03 , extended their analysis taking into account the neutronization produced during the simmering phase .    in this paper , we show that the first assumption of tbt03 does not hold for most snia .",
    "indeed , for a snia that produces @xmath9  m@xmath3 the fraction of @xmath0ni synthesized out of nse exceeds @xmath10 .",
    "with respect to the second assumption , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m07 ) showed , based on observational results , that the mass of fe - group nuclei ejected by snia spans the range from 0.4 to 1.1  m@xmath3 .",
    "this range can not be accounted for by metallicity variation within reasonable values .",
    "accordingly , our working hypothesis is that the yield of @xmath0ni in snia is governed by a primary parameter different from @xmath6 . in our one - dimensional models",
    "the primary parameter is the ddt density , @xmath11 , although in nature it may be something else such as the expansion rate during the deflagration phase .",
    "the initial metallicity is a secondary factor that can give rise to scatter in the value of @xmath1 either directly ( _ linear scenario _ ) , by affecting the chemical composition of the ejecta for a given value of the primary parameter , or indirectly ( _ non - linear scenario _ ) , by modifying the primary parameter itself .",
    "the understanding of which one of these two characters is actually being played by @xmath6 is of paramount importance .",
    "we explore the sensitivity of @xmath1 to the progenitor metallicity , starting from pre - main sequence models of masses , @xmath13 , in the range @xmath14  m@xmath3 and metallicities , @xmath6 , from @xmath15 to 0.10 , as given in the first column of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the initial mass fractions of all the isotopes with @xmath16 have been fixed in solar proportion , according to @xcite ; consequently , we adopt for the solar metallicity the value @xmath17 . each presupernova model has been evolved from the pre - main sequence to the thermal pulse ( tp ) agb phase , in order to determine the mass , @xmath18 , and chemical structure of the c - o core left behind . afterwards ,",
    "an envelope of the appropriate size to reach the chandrasekhar mass , @xmath19 , has been added on top of the c - o cores , and these structures have been fed as initial models to a supernova hydrocode .",
    "finally , the explosive nucleosynthesis has been obtained with a post - processing nucleosynthetic code .",
    "the hydrostatic evolution has been computed by means of the franec code @xcite . with respect to the calculations of dhs01",
    ", the code has been updated in the input physics . for the purposes of the present paper , the most important changes concern the @xmath20 reaction rate , which is calculated according to @xcite instead of @xcite , and the treatment of convective mixing during the late part of the core - he burning @xcite .",
    "the presupernova model is a chandrasekhar mass wd built in hydrostatic equilibrium with a central density @xmath21  g  @xmath22 .",
    "the composition of the envelope of mass @xmath23 is the same as that of the outermost shell of the c - o core .",
    "thus , instead of assuming c / o=1 , as in dhs01 , we adopt the c / o ratio obtained as a result of he - shell burning during the agb phase .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath24 and the composition of the envelope has been tested in several models , as explained later .",
    "we leave aside other eventual complexities of pre - supernova physics like rotation @xcite .    the internal composition of the wd is eventually modified during the simmering phase , due to the combined effects of convective mixing , carbon burning and electron captures .",
    "the first two phenomena affect the carbon abundance within the core , while the latter leads to an increase of @xmath5 .",
    "the average ( within the wd ) carbon consumption and neutron excess increase during the simmering phase are @xmath25  mol  g@xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we assume that convective mixing is limited to the c - o core , which implies that the change in the neutron excess _ within the core _ is @xmath28 .",
    "we have also exploded several models disregarding the simmering phase , to which we will refer in the following as _ stratified models_.    the supernova hydrodynamics code we have used is the same as in @xcite . as in dhs01 , the present models are based on the delayed - detonation paradigm @xcite . to address the _ linear scenario",
    "_ we take @xmath11 independent of @xmath6 . in this case , @xmath29  g  @xmath22 , although simulations with @xmath11 in the range @xmath30  g  @xmath22 are also reported .    for the _ non - linear scenario _ we have adopted the criterion that a ddt is induced when the laminar flame thickness , @xmath31 , becomes of the order of the turbulent gibson length @xmath32 @xcite , with the flame properties ( velocity and width ) depending on the abundances of @xmath33c ( eq . 22 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath34ne @xcite , and hence on @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite concluded from 2d simulations of snia that the metallicity does not affect the dynamics of the explosion , and so the turbulence intensity is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , for a given turbulent intensity a change in @xmath6 can be compensated by a change in @xmath11 in order to recover the condition @xmath35 ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario",
    "we have scaled the transition density as a function of the local chemical composition as follows : @xmath36 in order to introduce an @xmath5 dependence in the above expression we have assumed , for simplicity , that the bulk of neutronized isotopes synthesized during the simmering phase accelerates the carbon consumption rate the same way @xmath34ne does .",
    "the results of the hydrostatic evolution of our presupernova models are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "for each @xmath13 and @xmath6 we give : @xmath18 , the central abundance of @xmath33c and @xmath5 in stratified models , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the same quantities in the models accounting for the simmering phase , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in comparison with dhs01",
    ", the present models span a larger range of @xmath6 , as dhs01 computed models with @xmath41 . in the common range of @xmath6 and @xmath13",
    "the results are comparable , although the adopted rate of the @xmath20 reaction leads to a slightly larger carbon abundance than in dhs01 .",
    "the differences in @xmath18 between our models and those of dhs01 are smaller than @xmath42  m@xmath3 . the central carbon to oxygen ratio and @xmath18 we obtain , and their dependencies with @xmath6 and @xmath13 , agree as well with @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath6 . for the stratified models , we obtain the same range of variation of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath13 at given @xmath6 as dhs01 : 0.06  m@xmath3 ,",
    "although the @xmath43 yields do not match with dhs01 because they used different values of @xmath44  g  @xmath22 and @xmath45  g  @xmath22 .",
    "the models accounting for the simmering phase behave like the stratified models with respect to variations in @xmath13 and @xmath6 , although with a smaller total @xmath1 due to electron captures during the simmering phase . the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath6 can be approximated by a linear function : @xmath46 while stratified models can be approximated by : @xmath47 , i.e. the slope of the linear function is quite insensitive to the carbon simmering phase .    to explore the _ non - linear scenario",
    "_ we have computed models accounting for the simmering phase with fixed @xmath48  m@xmath3 . introducing a composition dependent",
    "@xmath11 produces a qualitatively different result because the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath6 is no longer linear , especially at low metallicites for which a larger @xmath11 is obtained , implying a much larger @xmath1 .",
    "our results can be fit by a polinomial law : @xmath49 both the central density at the onset of thermal runaway and the final c / o ratio in the accreted layers have a minor effect on @xmath1 within the explored range .",
    "tbt03 proposed a linear relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath6 : @xmath50 ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in all of our present models",
    "we find a steeper slope .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy lies in the assumption by tbt03 that most of the @xmath0ni is synthesized in nse . in our models",
    "a sizeable fraction of @xmath0ni is always synthesized during incomplete si - burning , whose final composition has a stronger dependence on @xmath6 than nse matter .",
    "as @xcite showed , the mean neutronization of fe - peak isotopes during incomplete si - burning is much larger than the global neutronization of matter because neutron - rich isotopes within the si - group are quickly photodissociated , providing free neutrons that are efficiently captured by nuclei in the fe - peak group , favouring their neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that up to @xmath51 of @xmath52 can be made out of nse , the actual fraction depending essentially on the total mass of fe - group elements ejected .",
    "thus , the less @xmath1 is synthesized , the larger fraction of it is built during incomplete si - burning and the stronger is its dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "the results presented in the previous section show that the metallicity is not the primary parameter that allows to reproduce the whole observational scatter of @xmath1 , for a reasonable range of @xmath6 .",
    "we have also shown that a possible dependence of the primary parameter on @xmath6 , would lead to a non - linear relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath6 , as in eq .",
    ". however , as we will show in the following , it would be possible to unravel the way @xmath1 depends on @xmath6 by means of future accurate measurements of snia properties .",
    "we start analysing the amount of the scatter induced by the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath6 given by eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] . for simplicity",
    "we follow the procedure of m07 to estimate the supernova luminosity and lc width .",
    "the peak bolometric luminosity , @xmath53 , is determined directly by the mass of @xmath0ni synthesized ( in the following , all masses are in @xmath54 and energies are in @xmath55  ergs ) : @xmath56=2\\times10^{43}m(^{56}\\mathrm{ni})~\\mathrm{erg}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ , , \\label{eq1.5}\\ ] ] while the bolometric lc width , @xmath57 , is determined by the kinetic energy , @xmath58 , and the opacity , @xmath59 : @xmath60 .",
    "the kinetic energy is given by the difference of the wd initial binding energy , @xmath61 , and the nuclear energy released , the latter being related to the final chemical composition of the ejecta : @xmath62 + 1.24m_\\mathrm{ime } -\\mathrm{|be|}$ ] , where @xmath63 is the total mass of fe - group nuclei and @xmath64 is the mass of intermediate - mass elements ( ime ) . the opacity is provided mainly by fe - group nuclei and imes : @xmath65 .",
    "we have taken @xmath66 , which is a good approximation given the small variation of binding energy with initial central density : @xmath61 is in the range @xmath67 for @xmath68  g  @xmath22 . to reduce the number of free parameters we further link @xmath64 to @xmath63 imposing that the ejected mass is the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath69 in our models ) , and that the amount of unburned c+o scales as @xmath70 , as deduced from our models .",
    "thus , @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the mass of @xmath0ni is linked to the mass of fe - group nuclei by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] or a similar function , and @xmath74 is the mass of the neutron - rich fe - group core ( due to electron captures during the explosion ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath75 , which is representative of the range of masses obtained in our models : @xmath76 for @xmath68  g  @xmath22 . finally , to compare with observed values a scale factor of 24.4",
    "is applied to the value of @xmath57 thus obtained , as in m07 .",
    "putting all these together , we obtain the following expression for the bolometric lc width ( in days ) as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath6 : @xmath77 = 21.9\\frac { \\left\\lbrace\\displaystyle{\\frac{m(^{56}\\mathrm{ni})}{f(z)}}-0.027 + 0.263\\sqrt{1 - 0.482\\displaystyle { \\frac{m(^{56}\\mathrm{ni } ) } { f(z)}}}\\right\\rbrace^{1/2 } } { \\left\\lbrace\\left(\\displaystyle{\\frac{1.115}{f(z)}}-0.115\\right)m(^{56}\\mathrm{ni})-1.46 + 2.09\\sqrt { 1 - 0.482\\displaystyle{\\frac{m(^{56}\\mathrm{ni})}{f(z)}}}\\right\\rbrace^{1/4}}\\ , .",

    "there are also represented the relationships obtained by substituting eq .",

    "[ eq1 ] gives a wider range of @xmath1 , which accounts better for the scatter of the observational data .",
    "indeed , if real snia follow eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , deriving supernova luminosities from @xmath6-uncorrected lc shapes might lead to systematic errors of up to 0.5  magnitudes .    to estimate the bearing that the metallicity dependence of @xmath1 can have on cosmological studies that use a large observational sample of supernovae , we have generated a virtual population of 200 snia that has been analyzed following the same methodology as g08 and h09 .",
    "each virtual supernova has been randomly assigned a progenitor metallicity , from a uniform distribution of @xmath78 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and an @xmath63 , uniformly distributed in the range from 0.31 to 1.15  @xmath81 .",
    "the minimum and maximum @xmath1 thus obtained ( computed with eq .  [ eq1 ] and",
    "@xmath82 ) are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and the bolometric lc width , @xmath57 , lies in the range @xmath85  days . a @xmath6-uncorrected mass of @xmath0ni , @xmath86 ,",
    "has then been obtained as the value of @xmath1 that would give the same @xmath57 if @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath86 so computed gives an idea of the effect of fitting an observed snia lc with a template that takes no account of the supernova metallicity . from eq .",
    "[ eq1.5 ] , we estimate the hubble residual , hr , of each virtual snia at : @xmath88 . as a final step we have added gaussian noise with @xmath89 to both hr and @xmath78 , to simulate the effect of observational uncertainties .    a linear relationship @xmath90 has then been fit to the noisy virtual data by the least - squares technique , as in g08 and h09 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the results for 10,000 realizations of the noisy virtual dataset .",
    "the histogram gives the number counts of the slope @xmath91 in the 10,000 realizations .",
    "the whole process has been repeated by using eq .",
    "[ eq0 ] ( i.e. the _ linear scenario _ ) to represent the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath6 and the results are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . from the figure it is clear that , for a large enough set of snia whose luminosity and metallicity are measured with small enough errors , it is possible to discriminate between the _ linear _ and _ non - linear scenarios_. in our numerical experiment , the mean value of @xmath91 is 0.13 in the first case and 0.26 in the second case , both with a standard deviationof 0.02 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows also the observational results obtained by g08 , who approximated the metallicities of the snia in their sample by the @xmath6 of the host galaxy , obtained from an empirical galactic mass - metallicity relationship .",
    "the striking match between our results based on the _ non - linear scenario _ and those of g08 must be viewed with caution in view of the observational uncertainties involved in measuring supernova metallicities and the limitations of our models ( i.e. the assumption of spherical symmetry ) .",
    "recently , using a different method of determination of the snia metallicity , h09 arrived to a result opposite to that of g08 , i.e. they found that hr is uncorrelated with @xmath6 , leading to a distribution centered around @xmath92 .",
    "thus , until such discrepancies are resolved it is not possible to draw any firm conclusion about the metallicity effect on snia luminosity .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that the simultaneous measurement of supernova luminosity and metallicity for a large snia set would strongly constrain the physics of the deflagration - to - detonation transition in thermonuclear supernovae , one of the key standing problems in supernova theory .",
