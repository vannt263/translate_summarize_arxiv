    "the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) made of dilute ultracold gases of bosonic atoms obeys the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) in the mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "an effective 1d equation can be derived from the 3d  gpe to describe the bec dynamics in prolate ( `` cigar - shaped '' ) traps @xcite-@xcite . in the simplest case , which corresponds to a sufficiently low bec density ,",
    "the reduced 1d equation amounts to the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite .",
    "a significant restriction in the use of the 1d cubic nlse in this context is its failure to predict the onset of the collapse of localized modes , which was theoretically predicted in 3d models and experimentally observed in the self - attractive bec @xcite .",
    "this problem can be resolved by the more accurate reduction of the 3d gpe to the 1d nonlinear schrdinger equation with a _ nonpolynomial _ nonlinearity ( npse ) sala1 , @xcite , without imposing the constraint of a very low density .",
    "the 1d npse model with self - attractive nonlinearity enables the description of the collapse dynamics , and yields results which are accurately reproduced by direct simulations of the underlying 3d gpe @xcite .",
    "an intermediate approximation , which can be obtained from the expansion of the npse , is represented by the 1d nlse with the self - focusing cubic and quintic terms .",
    "this approximation may be sufficient for some particular purposes shlyap02,brand06,lev .",
    "on the other hand , the bec trapped in a very deep optical lattice ( ol ) can be well described by the corresponding discrete equations . in particular , discrete forms of the 1d gpe with the cubic nonlinearity dnls - bec , gpe , dnls - bec - review and 1d npse @xcite have been studied in detail .",
    "basic features of the 1d continual models describing the bec trapped in a deep ol find their counterparts in the discrete models , a significant one being the ability of the discrete 1d npse to describe the onset of the collapse predicted by the corresponding continual equation luca , nash .",
    "thus , the previously explored 1d discrete bec models relied upon the discretization after the reduction of the dimension from @xmath0 to @xmath1 within the framework of the continual equations . however , an alternative approach is possible too , in the situation when the ol is stronger than the cigar - shaped potential : one should first discretize the 3d gpe in the axial direction , and then reduce the dimension to @xmath1 @xcite , opposite to the previously developed derivation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to derive the discrete model in this way , which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been done before .",
    "naturally , the two different routes lead to quite different discrete systems . in particular , the one derived in this work involves two sets of discrete variables ( the wave function and transverse width ) , rather than the single set on which previously studied models were based .",
    "our purpose is not only to derive the alternative system , but also to study generic properties of fundamental unstaggered solitons in it , and compare the results with those obtained in the earlier known discrete npse .",
    "in fact , we will conclude that , despite a very different form of the new model , it gives rise to results quite similar to those produced by the discrete npse .",
    "thus , despite significant differences in the form of the  competing \" models , the physical predictions for the discrete bec solitons are essentially the same , which attests to the reliability of these results .",

    "<S> the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , confined in a combination of the cigar - shaped trap and axial optical lattice , is studied in the framework of two models described by two versions of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) discrete nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) . both models </S>",
    "<S> are derived from the three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( 3d gpe ) . to produce  model 1 \" ( which was derived in recent works ) </S>",
    "<S> , the 3d gpe is first reduced to the 1d continual npse , which is subsequently discretized .  model 2 \" , that was not considered before , is derived by first discretizing the 3d gpe , which is followed by the reduction of the dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the two models seem very different ; in particular , model 1 is represented by a single discrete equation for the 1d wave function , while model 2 includes an additional equation for the transverse width . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , numerical analyses show similar behaviors of fundamental unstaggered solitons in both systems , as concerns their existence region and stability limits . </S>",
    "<S> both models admit the collapse of the localized modes , reproducing the fundamental property of the self - attractive bec confined in tight traps . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the fundamental properties of discrete solitons predicted for the strongly trapped self - attracting bec are reliable , as the two distinct models produce them in a nearly identical form . </S>",
    "<S> however , a difference between the models is found too , as strongly pinned ( very narrow ) discrete solitons , which were previously found in model 1 , are not generated by model 2  in fact , in agreement with the continual 1d npse , which does not have such solutions either . in that respect , </S>",
    "<S> the newly derived model provides for a more accurate approximation for the trapped bec .    * </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of a dilute quantum gas which forms the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is very accurately described by the three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( 3d gpe ) . </S>",
    "<S> this equation treats effects of collisions between atoms in the condensate in the mean - field approximation . in experimentally relevant settings , </S>",
    "<S> the bec  is always confined by a trapping potential . in many cases , </S>",
    "<S> the trap is designed to have the  cigar - shaped \" form , allowing an effective reduction of the dimension from 3 to 1 . in turn , the 1d dynamics of the trapped condensate may be controlled by means of an additional periodic potential , induced by an optical lattice ( ol ) , which acts along the axis of the  cigar \" . if the ol potential is sufficiently strong , the eventual dynamical model reduces to a 1d discrete equation . in both the continual and discrete versions of the 1d description , </S>",
    "<S> a crucially important feature is the form of the nonlinearity in the respective equations . in the limit of low density , the nonlinearity is cubic  the same as in the underlying 3d gpe . in the general case , </S>",
    "<S> a consistent derivation , which starts from the cubic nonlinearity in 3d , leads to 1d equations with a nonpolynomial nonlinearity , the respective model being called the  nonpolynomial schrdinger equation \" ( npse ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete limit of the latter equation , corresponding to the action of the strong axial ol potential , was derived and investigated recently . </S>",
    "<S> an essential asset of both versions of the npse , continual and discrete ones , is that they predict the onset of the collapse ( formation of a singularity in the condensate with attraction between atoms ) in the framework of the 1d description , thus complying with the fundamental property of the bec which was predicted by the underlying 3d gpe and observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case when the ol potential is very strong , an alternative way to derive the 1d discrete model may start with the discretization of the 3d gpe , followed by the reduction of the dimension in the cigar - shaped trap . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we report a new discrete model (  model 2 \" ) derived in this way , which seems very different from the previously known discrete 1d npse ( which we call  model 1 \" ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , while model 1 amounts to a single discrete equation for the 1d complex wave function , model 2 incorporates an additional equation for the transverse width . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , numerical analysis performed in the present work shows remarkably similar behavior of fundamental localized modes , in the form of unstaggered discrete solitons , in both systems . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity pertains to the existence region for the solitons and their stability limits . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , both models admit the collapse , and produce similar predictions for the collapse threshold . thus , basic properties of discrete solitons found in the model of the strongly trapped bec are trustworthy , as they are reproduced independently by the two very different models . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a difference between the two models is also found : very narrow discrete solitons , which exist in model 1 , are absent in model 2 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the continual 1d npse does not give rise to such extremely narrow solutions either , thus indicating that the newly derived model , although having a more complex mathematical form , eventually provides a more accurate approximation . * </S>"
