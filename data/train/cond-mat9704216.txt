    "recent progress in semiconductor technology now allows the fabrication of artificially structured atoms in semiconductors called quantum dots , in which electrons are trapped in a small localized region of space of a few hundred angstrms . in these nanostructures",
    "the electron wavelength is of the same length scale as the confinement so that quantum effects are important , which results in the quantization of single - electron energy levels with excitation energy of several mev ( see for review @xcite ) . a prominent feature of a fermi - system which is confined to a finite region of space is the emergence of shell effects in the single - particle spectrum as is well known in nuclear physics @xcite and more recently for large metallic clusters ( @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . in the present work we address this problem to mesoscopic systems like quantum dots which contain a small number of electrons .",
    "the electron states of few - electron quantum dots subjected to a strong magnetic field have been studied extensively in @xcite-@xcite . the electrodynamic response of an interacting electron system in the presence of a confining potential",
    "is expected to be dominated by the many - body effects of the electrons .",
    "sikorski and merkt @xcite found experimentally the surprising result that the resonance frequencies in the magneto - optical spectrum are independent of the number of electrons in the quantum dot .",
    "the systems which are experimentally realized extent much less in the the @xmath3direction than in the @xmath4plane .",
    "this has led to a simple description of the far - infrared resonance ( fir ) frequencies @xcite as the energy levels of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it was interpreted as a consequence of kohn s theorem @xcite which has been generalized for a parabolic potential @xcite . according to this theorem ,",
    "the total hamiltonian can be divided into two parts , the center - of - mass motion ( cm ) and the relative motion which contains the electron - electron interaction . since the radiation of an external electric dipole field couples only to the cm motion and does not affect the relative motion , the dipole resonance frequencies for the interacting system should be exactly the same as those of the noninteracting system and be independent of the electron - electron interaction .    a full understanding of the experimental results needs an analysis of many - body effects .",
    "microscopic calculations using hartree approximation for electron numbers @xmath5 @xcite neglected the exchange and correlation effects .",
    "the direct numerical diagonalization @xcite have been performed only for three- and four electron systems .",
    "the more complicated resonance structure observed in @xcite raised the question as to the validity of kohn s theorem for quantum dots . in order to describe the experimental data it was assumed that , in real samples , there is a deviation of the confining potential from the parabolic form , and different corrections",
    "have been introduced @xcite .",
    "also , the important role of the combined effect of the coulomb forces and spin interaction leading to a redistribution of single - electron levels was demonstrated for the whole energy spectrum , especially for the low - lying single - electron states in the homogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ground state transitions predicted in this way have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore natural to assume that the properties of the electron states close to the fermi level are determined by an effective mean field .",
    "it is true that the external field is the dominant part of the mean field , and thus the effective confining potential should reflect the main features of it . yet it must also contain the effect of the interplay between coulomb forces and the external fields which are governed by the charges in the adjacent layers and gates and the magnetic field . due to these considerations , we assume that the confining potential should also take into account the changes that affect the properties of the single - electron states owing to a variation of the homogeneous magnetic field as well as the slab thickness .    based on the results discussed in @xcite we conclude that the harmonic oscillator potential can serve as one of the phenomenological effective confining potentials in real samples , at least for small electron numbers . in this paper",
    "we study a simple model of a three - dimensional quantum dot in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field for electron numbers for which the assumption of a parabolic type potential is still physically reasonable .",
    "our procedure invokes an effective dependence of the parameters of the confining potential on the magnetic field . in this way , we accommmodate the different mechanisms mentioned above and we allow the system to adjust and change its shape under variation of the applied magnetic field and the particle number .",
    "we assume that the electron system behaves like an isolated yet confined droplet ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the major result is a dependence of the single - electron states on the slab thickness .",
    "such dependence shows in the fir frequencies on which our analysis is focussed .",
    "we also report on transition strengths in absorption experiments and on the spatial extension of the confining potential in a quantum dot .",
    "preliminary results have been reported in @xcite .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian for @xmath6 noninteracting electrons moving in an effective mean field , i.e. a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath7 with @xmath8/2 $ ] being the vector potential associated with the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "the model does not explicitly take into account spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in other words , the system is assumed to be in a fixed spin state of an arbitrary degree of polarisation .",
    "only the orbital motion is affected by the magnetic field .",
    "using quantum mechanical equations of motion yip @xcite calculated resonance frequencies for this model .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to @xcite , but we first solve the classical problem , from which all quantum mechanical results easily follow .",
    "in contrast to @xcite where the fir frequencies are completely determined by the external potential , the effective mean field responds in our approach to the change of the magnetic field and particle number and thus affects the properties of single - particle excitations .",
    "we determine the frequencies @xmath10 by minimizing the total energy for a given number of electrons @xmath6 . in this way",
    "we allow the system to adjust the shape of the confining potential under the influence of the applied magnetic field and the particle number .",
    "the classical equations of motion for the cartesian components of the momentum and position coordinates read @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are combined to the six dimensional column vector denoted below as @xmath14 .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where the notation @xmath17 is used . denoting the eigenvalues of @xmath15 by @xmath18 we obtain from the form @xmath19 the classical solution @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "while the classical orbits are of little interest in the present context , the eigenmodes @xmath22 and the system of eigenvectors listed in the matrix @xmath23 are essential for the quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "the eigenmodes which are usually referred to as the normal modes are obtained from the secular equation @xmath24 with @xmath25 denoting the six - dimensional unit matrix .",
    "the above equation turns out to be a third order polynomial in @xmath26 and has also been found by @xcite .",
    "the column vectors of @xmath23 are the ( complex ) right hand eigenvectors of @xmath27 ( note that @xmath27 is not symmetric , hence neither @xmath23 nor @xmath28 are unitary , yet @xmath29 ) .",
    "we denote the column vectors of @xmath23 by @xmath30 , they obey the equations @xmath31 which can be solved as an inhomogeneous system by choosing for instance the sixth component of @xmath30 equal to unity and then determining the normalisation as described in appendix a. with the proper normalisation the classical hamilton function of eq.([ham ] ) is cast into the quantum mechanical form @xmath32 the normal mode boson operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to the quantised version of the classical coordinates by @xmath35 where we denote by @xmath36 a column vector which is the transpose of the vector @xmath37 .",
    "the properties of the matrix @xmath38 guarantee the commutator @xmath39=i\\hbar \\,\\delta _ { k , k'}$ ] as a consequence of @xmath40=i\\hbar \\,\\delta _ { i , j}$ ] .",
    "we note that eq.([qam ] ) is the exact quantised equivalent of eq.([ham ] ) .",
    "the total energy of an @xmath6-particle system associated with the hamiltonian eq.([qam ] ) is given by @xmath41 the occupation numbers @xmath42 are the eigenvalues of @xmath43 and take the values @xmath44 .",
    "the ground state is determined by filling the single - particle levels @xmath45 from the bottom .",
    "we take care of the electron spin only in obeying the pauli principle which allows two particles in one level .",
    "it is clear that different sets of normal modes yield different sets of occupation numbers .",
    "the normal modes depend on the three components of the magnetic field and on the harmonic oscillator frequencies . from our assumption that the system adjusts itself under the influence of the magnetic field by minimising @xmath46 , a variation of the magnetic field strength leads to a corresponding change of the confining effective potential which is given by the oscillator frequencies . in other words , for a given magnetic field , we must seek the minimum of @xmath46 under variation of the oscillator frequencies .",
    "the variation can not be unrestricted as the confining potential encloses a fixed number of electrons , and assuming that the electron density does not change we are led to a fixed volume constraint which translates into the subsidiary condition @xmath47 with @xmath48 fixed . denoting the lagrange multiplier by @xmath49 we solve the variational problem @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the ground state as described above .    from eq.([var ] ) we obtain , after differentiation with respect to the frequencies and using feynman s theorem @xcite @xmath52 the useful condition @xmath53 which must be obeyed at the minimum of @xmath46 .    in this paper we restrict ourselves to consideration of a thin slab which extents essentially in two dimensions .",
    "this is achieved by varying only @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the minimization procedure while keeping @xmath56 fixed at a value which is , say , five times larger than the other two frequencies . in this case",
    "only @xmath57 can be fulfilled .",
    "choosing different ( fixed ) values of @xmath56 allows to study the dependence of the results on the slab thickness .",
    "it is known from the two - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator that shell closing occurs for fermions at the numbers @xmath58 . at these numbers",
    "strong shell effects manifest themselves as the most stable quantum configurations . as a consequence , for @xmath59 and @xmath60 we must expect the minimum of @xmath46 at the symmetric condition @xmath61 for such electron numbers . in the mean field approach ,",
    "the breaking of spherical symmetry of the potential gives rise to a deformed shape ( jahn - teller effect @xcite ) .",
    "for example , rotational spectra of nuclei and fine structure in the mass spectra of metallic clusters are explained as a consequence of deformed equilibrium potentials of these systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , for numbers between the shell numbers a deformed configuration ( @xmath62 ) can be expected ; we note that there are always two symmetric solutions : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the condition @xmath59 ensures that we have a genuine two - dimensional problem in that no particle occupies a quantum mode in the @xmath65-direction @xmath66 .",
    "however , if the slab is made thicker ( @xmath56 smaller ) , the occupation of the first mode @xmath67 will occur at the top end of the occupied levels , which could mean that we find then the symmetric minimum at @xmath68 , since two particles are occupying the @xmath65-mode that has become available .",
    "the distinction between a slab , that is sufficiently thin so as to prevent occupation of the first mode in the @xmath65-direction , and the slab which can accommodate the first mode is seen physically in the degeneracy of the two lowest normal modes at @xmath60 .",
    "an estimate for @xmath69 ( see appendix b ) which is the frequency that just forbids occupation of a @xmath65-mode is given by @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the average of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the level spacing @xmath72 of the oscillator potential is determined by equating the fermi energy @xmath73 of a free electron gas with the potential energy @xmath74 . assuming that the radius of a quantum dot grows with @xmath75 we have @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , we have chosen @xmath77 where the fermi energy is obtained from the mean radius @xmath78 and effective mass of typical quantum dots ; for gaas , @xmath78=320and @xmath79 yield @xmath80mev . throughout the paper we use mev as energy units ,   for length and tesla for the magnetic field strengths .",
    "the three normal modes which can be discerned experimentally as excitation energies in fir - spectroscopy @xcite behave in a distinctly characteristic way when the magnetic field is switched on .",
    "we recall that the values for @xmath54 and @xmath55 are fixed by minimizing @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "1 we display typical patterns for two different electron numbers . in both cases , @xmath56 is chosen so large that @xmath81 remains zero . note",
    "that , when the magnetic field is switched on , the occupation numbers @xmath82 refer to the normal modes and can no longer necessarily be associated with an @xmath83- , @xmath84- or @xmath65-direction .",
    "= 2.8 in    0.2 cm    the degeneracy for @xmath85 is clearly seen at @xmath60 whereas three distinct modes , corresponding to a deformed shape , are seen at @xmath60 for @xmath86 .",
    "the behaviour is shown for values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath89 the third mode ( the highest at @xmath60 ) does not interact with the applied field , therefore there is a level crossing at about @xmath90 .",
    "this becomes a level repulsion for @xmath91 as now all modes are affected by the magnetic field . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath92-dependence is strongly pronounced for the two upper modes , while such dependence is insignificant for the lowest mode .",
    "here we find quite naturally an interpretation of avoided level crossing observed in the experiments @xcite associated with shape variations in a tilted magnetic field .",
    "we have also investigated the @xmath93-dependence of the normal modes , which is expected to become significant only for large values of @xmath94 ; the differences are small , they can not be seen in fig .",
    "we return to a particular situation where the @xmath93-dependence is important .",
    "= 2.8 in    0.2 cm    there are windows of magnetic field strength for which the normal modes are virtually constant .",
    "they are discernible especially at smaller values of the magnetic field strength and are a reflection of shape changes . for @xmath85",
    "the system is rotationally symmetric at @xmath60 . at @xmath95",
    "it changes into a deformed shape ( @xmath62 ) which is associated with the larger derivatives of the two lower normal modes . the symmetric shape ( @xmath61 )",
    "is now being restored in a continuous fashion when @xmath96 is further increased , the two normal modes are virtually constant during this smooth transition .",
    "the constancy of the normal modes holds strictly only for @xmath89 and can be shown analytically ; this is deferred to appendix c. at @xmath97 , where the system has eventually re - gained its symmetric shape , a second shape transition occurs for @xmath98 , which is reflected by the second sharp decrease / increase of the first / second normal mode .",
    "this pattern continues , yet it is less and less pronounced with increasing field strength .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these shape changes can be dissolved experimentally ; finite temperature could disturb this pattern .    making the slab thicker ,",
    "that is choosing @xmath56 smaller so as to allow occupation of the next level of the third mode ( @xmath99 ) , invokes distinct changes which could possibly be dissolved experimentally . in fig .",
    "2 we display the effect of varying the slab thickness for @xmath85 . for clarity",
    "we focus on smaller magnetic field strength and we display only results for @xmath89 .",
    "the top figure is to facilitate comparison ; the results are a repeat of fig.(1b ) . in the middle figure",
    "the slab thickness has been decreased in such a way that the third mode becomes occupied when the field is switched on while it is unoccupied for zero field strength . as a consequence",
    ", the shape transition occurs for smaller field strength , it is here directly associated with the switch from @xmath100 to @xmath99 which is induced by the magnetic field in this particular case .",
    "the bottom figure refers to the case where @xmath99 throughout .",
    "the major effect is the lifting of degeneracy for @xmath101 .",
    "since there are effectively only 28 particles occupying the two lower modes , the confining potential is deformed .    with increasing field strength the potential changes into a symmetric shape which is attained at about @xmath102 where it again undergoes a transition to a deformed shape in line with the discussion above .",
    "in this context we note that an increase of @xmath56 beyond the values used in the results presented , which means an even thinner slab , pushes the upper level further away . a truly two - dimensional",
    "setting should therefore yield only two observable levels .",
    "= 2.8 in    0.2 cm    the effective occupation in the two lower modes can also be demonstrated by using @xmath103 or @xmath104 . for",
    "@xmath99 this yields the effective numbers 20 or 30 in the planary motion with the expectation that the energy minimum is adopted for a symmetric shape .",
    "this is nicely confirmed and demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 where results for @xmath104 are presented .",
    "the top and bottom figures illustrate the cases where @xmath100 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the interpretation is selfexplanatory after the previous discussions .    in all the examples we see quantum mechanics nicely at work . despite the simplicity of the model",
    ", these effects should be seen in an experiment .",
    "the actual observation of the three modes is achieved by electromagnetic transitions , for instance in absorption experiments . within the single - particle model considered here",
    "transition matrix elements between the ground state and single - particle excitations are available for any single - particle operator .",
    "the electric dipole transition is expected to feature prominently .",
    "we note that this transition rules out a spin flip , which is in line with our assumption about fixed spin states .",
    "we interpret the three observed frequencies @xcite as the three normal modes .",
    "if no photon polarisation is measured in the initial and final states , the dipole transition strength is given by @xmath105 since the electric dipole operator is proprtional to @xmath13 .",
    "using eq.([lin ] ) the matrix elements are given by a sum over the appropriate entries of the matrix @xmath23 .",
    "the selection rules allow only transitions with @xmath106 by which all accessible final states are determined .",

    "we list some results in table 1 .",
    "they refer to @xmath89 and @xmath100 for the ground state . these figures do change as a function of @xmath94 , electron number and slab thickness .",

    "the calculation of matrix elements of @xmath114 and @xmath115 which are characterized by the shape of the effective confining potential follows similar lines as for the dipole matrix elements . in table 2",
    "we give a few values for @xmath85 and @xmath89 .",
    "note the strong deformation at @xmath116 . for larger field strengths the mean",

    "we stress that these values all obey the condition eq.([cond ] ) . for @xmath117",
    "the pattern remains essentially the same except for the fact , that the shape is not symmetric for large field strength but deformed ; the degree of deformation depends on @xmath94 .",
    "this is again understood from the larmor frequencies which are now different for the different directions .",
    "this argument is nicely confirmed when using @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; now the symmetry is guaranteed by the choice @xmath119 , and , in fact , the system settles down to a symmetric configuration for large field strength .",

    "the simplicity of the soluble model allows consideration of an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field .",

    "we find an effective @xmath6-dependence of the fir frequencies in quantum dots ( see fig.@xmath1241 ) .",
    "an interesting aspect of the model is the constancy of the fir frequencies ( the normal modes ) under variation of the magnetic field as long as the potential is deformed .",
    "as is discussed in section 4 the system responds to the increasing magnetic field strength by changing the confining potential towards a spherical shape rather than by changing its energy .",
    "this is shown analytically in appendix c for @xmath89 where it strictly holds .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath91 the statement still holds to high accuracy .",
