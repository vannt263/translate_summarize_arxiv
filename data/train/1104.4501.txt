    "ultraviolet observations of galaxies acquired by _ galex _ have recently challenged the notion of a well - defined star formation threshold by showing that outer star formation can exist at radii that are four times beyond the optical extent of the galaxy @xcite . following the discovery of extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) emission in the outer disks of ngc 4625 and m 83 @xcite , thilker et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter t07 ) conducted the first survey of extended uv emission in a sample of 189 nearby ( d @xmath0 40 mpc ) disk galaxies and concluded that 29% of disk galaxies exhibit xuv emission .",
    "they developed a classification system in which type 1 xuv - disks show a number of uv - bright , optically - faint , structured complexes beyond the star formation threshold and type 2 xuv - disks have a large , blue , low surface brightness ( lsb ) zone beyond the limit within which optical light dominates .",
    "perhaps more surprising than the existence of star formation in the outer regions of disks is the existence of xuv - disks around early - type galaxies . in a survey of 31 e / s0 galaxies ,",
    "@xcite identified 13 as xuv - disks .",
    "ngc 404 @xcite and eso 381 - 47 @xcite are both early - type galaxies considered type 1 xuv - disks because of a ring of star formation discernible in the uv .",
    "@xcite revealed a population of massive early - type galaxies with uv excess that contain extended uv structures .",
    "xuv - disks around early - type galaxies are especially puzzling because they suggest that extended star formation does not require the presence of an inner star - forming disk .",
    "a distinct but related phenomenon presented in @xcite is the presence of outlying hii regions around gas - rich galaxies , some of which are associated with type 1 xuv - disks . out of the seven galaxies they found to be supporting outer hii regions ,",
    "six of them are undergoing interactions or have nearby companions , providing evidence for interactions as a cause of extended star formation .",
    "they estimate that 6 - 10% of gas - rich galaxies contain recent star formation in their outer disks .",
    "the existence and frequency of galaxies with xuv emission has implications regarding not just the expected radial extent of star formation but also the viability of star formation in regions of low gas density , the process of disk - building , and the causes of star formation in the outer regions of galaxies of all types .",

    "recent cosmological simulations done by @xcite established a possible link between xuv - disks and cold gas accretion .",
    "a systematic analysis of the types of galaxies in which xuv - disks predominate could provide crucial information about the origin of xuv - disks and their context in the overall framework of galaxy evolution .    in this paper we extend the sample of xuv - disks to higher redshifts by conducting an unbiased survey of over 500 local galaxies with redshifts up to z=0.05 .",
    "such a large and volume - limited sample allows us to determine the space density of xuv - disk galaxies .",
    "we analyze the properties of the xuv - disk galaxies in relation to the rest of the sample in order to determine the types of galaxies that tend to exhibit xuv emission , the nature of the xuv emission itself , and the causes of xuv emission .",

    "the theoretical and observational motivation behind the chosen star formation threshold is described in detail in t07 .",
    "we note that the primary reason for the choice of the specific uv threshold given above stems from @xcite which showed that the threshold given above coincides with the h@xmath22 break found in @xcite galaxies . more recent work has provided further evidence of the existence of a star formation threshold by comparing the star formation rate surface density to the gas surface density and demonstrating that there is a downturn in star formation at low gas surface densities @xcite .    we proceeded by overlaying the contour representing the fuv surface brightness limit , given above , on a 4@xmath10 @xmath2 4@xmath10 _ galex _ fuv and nuv composite image of each galaxy .",
    "we visually inspected each image to identify uv emission beyond that contour .",
    "the exposure times in our survey allow us to detect lsb features down to a limiting magnitude of 29.25 abmag arcsec@xmath14 with a signal to noise ratio equal to 5 on small scales comparable to the _ galex _ psf .    each galaxy with detected uv flux - structured or diffuse , clearly connected to the target galaxy or not - beyond the threshold was identified as an xuv - disk galaxy .",
    "we also identified a number of galaxies as xuv - ambiguous .",
    "( all xuv - disk and xuv - ambiguous galaxy identifications were agreed upon by j.j.l . and d.s . )",
    "the xuv - ambiguous galaxies have uv emission just beyond the expected star formation contour that may be residual flux associated with the main star - forming disk as opposed to real extended star formation independent of the central disk . in some cases , the uv emission that qualified a galaxy for xuv - ambiguous status may actually be a background source or part of a broad wing of the _ galex _ psf .",
    "nevertheless , some of the xuv - ambiguous galaxies could very well turn out to be xuv - disks when deeper or more highly resolved images are obtained . in the following analysis , we include both the definite xuv - disks and the xuv - ambiguous galaxies to provide some measure of the uncertainty in our classification procedure though we treat them separately at times to point out the differences between the two populations .    here",
    ", we do not impose any restrictions on the optical brightness of the xuv - disk or its component structures . in section [ sec : color cut ] and",
    "the appendix we examine how such a restriction may change our sample and conclusions .",
    "we recognize that our classification scheme is less quantitative and therefore more ambiguous than previous xuv - disk classification schemes .",
    "the ambiguity inherent in our visual classification scheme may cause us to identify xuv - disks where others may not have seen xuv - disks , and it is quite likely that the limits imposed on our study by the resolution of _ galex _ causes us to underestimate the frequency of xuv - disks . at the highest redshifts represented in our sample , the image resolution is 2.4 kpc@xmath23 per pixel ( see discussion in section [ sec : redshift ] ) .",
    "our goal is to use a complete sample of galaxies in the local universe to derive global properties of xuv - disk galaxies based on an estimate of the frequency of such galaxies in our sample .",
    "our classification scheme is sufficient to meet these goals .",
    "in contrast to the classification scheme of t07 , which distinguishes xuv - disks based on the morphology of the extended star formation and thus is potentially linked to various formation scenarios , ours consists of one umbrella term for all galaxies with star formation beyond the previously expected radial limits . this system does not allow us to characterize different types of xuv - disks , but it does allow us to identify xuv - disks at moderate redshifts . indeed , it is only with such a volume - limited sample extending to moderate redshifts that we can attempt to estimate the global properties of galaxies with xuv - disks .",
    "this work also serves as a way of determining the feasibility of detecting xuv - disks at larger distances and assessing the incompleteness of such detections .",

    "image on the left shows that the uv flux drops off much more rapidly than the optical light",
    ". beyond the optical extent of the object is at least one prominent spiral arm as well as a number of bright uv complexes that constitute the xuv emission .",

    ". the faint uv emission apparent at both ends of the galaxy in the _ galex _ image is indicative of a region of xuv emission beyond the expected extent of star formation in the disk .",
    "this galaxy also appears to have a slight warp in its xuv - disk . unlike other samples studied for the presence of xuv - disks , our sample is blind to inclination angle .",
    "because the critical isophote we use is not dust - corrected , our method is less effective for edge - on galaxies because the precise location of the star formation threshold is not obvious . on the other hand , projection effects observed in edge - on galaxies",

    "fig : gas_accr_red ] ) .",
    "given that the gas accretion rate is significant ( @xmath1 1.3 - 2.8 @xmath2 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 mpc@xmath4 yr@xmath4 ) even for xuv - disks around transition galaxies in the green valley , it is reasonable to consider that the infall of gas onto the xuv - disks lying in the green valley may lead to enough star formation to cause the galaxy to transition away from the red sequence .",
    "our results show that the xuv - disk fraction in the green valley is 7 - 18% ; thus , it is possible that a similar fraction of green valley galaxies might be moving away from the red sequence due to a new round of star formation in their outer regions .",
    "previous studies of the green valley ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) focused on the quenching processes occurring in green valley galaxies that might drive galaxies from the blue sequence to the red sequence .",
    "more recently , work has been done to target transition galaxies in the green valley in order to identify galaxies that are transitioning either to or from the red sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , ngc 404 is a lenticular galaxy that may be transitioning away from the red sequence .",
    "@xcite showed that if its hi ring is the result of a recent accretion event ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the star formation in the ring caused the galaxy to move from the red sequence into the green valley .",
    "more recently , @xcite used hst observations of the galaxy to show that its star formation rate has since decreased after a brief increase immediately following the accretion event .",
    "thus , although the accretion of new material initially led to an increased level of star formation that caused the galaxy to transition to the green valley , ngc 404 will likely fall back to the red sequence instead of moving blueward .",
    "ngc 404 is not a lone case : the majority of the massive early - type galaxies in the sample studied by @xcite appear to be similar to ngc 404 .",
    "they , too , lie in the green valley and have rejuvenated disks that are probably the result of gas accretion from the igm or minor mergers .",
    "the temporary detour to the green valley that was seen for ngc 404 provides support for our suggestion that xuv - disks represent a phase in the evolution of a galaxy .",
    "there are numerous examples in the literature of galaxies whose morphologies are indicative of xuv - disks and that appear to be undergoing a star formation event that is associated with gas accretion .",
    "indeed , @xcite discovered a population of transition galaxies with a  normal \" amount of hi ( most of the transition galaxies they studied were hi - deficient ) that are moving away from the red sequence as the hi is consumed and converted to stars .",
    "many of those hi - normal transition galaxies with obvious recent star formation display prominent uv rings .",
    "the presence of the uv rings suggests that the population @xcite describe includes xuv - disk galaxies that are in the process of disk - building .",
    "@xcite interpreted xuv - disks in e / s0s as evidence for disk - building following a merger and @xcite suggested that blue e / s0s , which may make up a fraction of our xuv - disks , are probably building disks as well . that disk - building can be a result of gas accretion is consistent with @xcite - they suggest that the cold gas accretion will form a disk around an evolved galaxy , providing fuel for extended star formation and a path away from the red sequence .    at this point , it is not easy to distinguish between transition galaxies that are experiencing a new wave of gas accretion and subsequently moving away from the red sequence and transition galaxies whose gas accretion rate is slowly decreasing , causing them to move towards the red sequence .",
    "ring - like features around early - type galaxies are often interpreted as signs of recent gas accretion , but it is possible that the phase of gas accretion represented by the ring is in fact ending .",
    "analysis of a galaxy s potential for new and continued star formation ( and subsequent movement within the color - magnitude diagram ) is locked up in the amount of hi gas in the galaxy .",
    "such a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper but crucial in determining exactly how much star formation can be expected in the xuv - disk and what effects it may have on galaxy morphology .",
    "future studies should focus on trying to disentangle observations of gas accretion and quenching of star formation so that we are able to conclusively identify a population of galaxies that are re - building disks and explore its connection to the population of xuv - disks .",
    "we report the xuv - disk space density in the local universe based on an unbiased survey of galaxies in the intersection of available galex deep imaging and sdss footprints .",
    "galaxies of all colors and masses exhibit xuv - disks , but a higher fraction of red massive early - type galaxies show evidence of star formation in their outer extents .",
    "we investigated the possibility that the extended star formation in many xuv - disk galaxies is due to cold mode accretion by estimating the gas accretion rate onto xuv - disks .",
    "there is a significant level of gas accretion onto all galaxy types , including transition galaxies in the green valley .",
    "gas accretion onto galaxies in the green valley may represent evidence that these galaxies are rebuilding their disks .",
    "some of our key results follow :    1 .   based on our measurements and simulations",
    ", we find that deep galex imaging allows us to detect xuv - disks beyond 100 mpc .",
    "we have used our unbiased survey to establish the average frequency of xuv - disks out to z=0.05 as 4 - 14% , with 4% as a hard lower limit . the incidence rises to close to 20% for the nearby portion of our sample ( somewhat consistent with , though lower than , previous findings ; i.e. those of ) .",
    "3 .   the calculated xuv - disk fraction along with measurements of the local space density of galaxies allows us to estimate that the space density of xuv - disks is @xmath1 1.5 - 4.2 @xmath2 10@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "we used an estimate of the gas content associated with xuv - disk galaxies to establish a gas accretion rate onto xuv - disk galaxies of @xmath1 1.7 - 4.6 @xmath2 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 @xmath4 yr@xmath6 .",
    "4 .   under the assumption that xuv - disk galaxies in the green valley might be rebuilding their disks , we find that 7 - 18% of galaxies in the green valley could be transitioning away from the red sequence .",
    "the work presented here represents an attempt to expand the known sample of xuv - disk galaxies and to estimate global properties of such galaxies .",
    "we are limited by the resolution of galex and thus restricted in our ability to make firm conclusions about the prevalence of such galaxies in different mass ranges and at various redshifts .",
    "future searches for xuv - disks will require data with greater sensitivity and finer resolution in order to detect small pockets of star formation in the outer reaches of galaxies .",
