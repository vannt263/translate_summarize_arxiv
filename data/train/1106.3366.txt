    "the current standard cosmological model , @xmath14cdm , assumes that the initial fluctuations in the distribution of matter were seeded by quantum fluctuations pushed to cosmological scales by inflation .",
    "directly after inflation , the universe is radiation dominated and the baryonic matter is ionised and coupled to radiation through thomson scattering .",
    "the radiation pressure drives sound - waves originating from over - densities in the matter distribution  @xcite . at the time of recombination ( @xmath15 )",
    "the photons decouple from the baryons and shortly after that ( at the baryon drag epoch @xmath16 ) the sound wave stalls . through this process",
    "each over - density of the original density perturbation field has evolved to become a centrally peaked perturbation surrounded by a spherical shell  @xcite .",
    "the radius of these shells is called the sound horizon @xmath17 .",
    "both over - dense regions attract baryons and dark matter and will be preferred regions of galaxy formation .",
    "this process can equivalently be described in fourier space , where during the photon - baryon coupling phase , the amplitude of the baryon perturbations can not grow and instead undergo harmonic motion leading to an oscillation pattern in the power spectrum .",
    "after the time of recombination , the mean free path of photons increases and becomes larger than the hubble distance .",
    "hence from now on the radiation remains almost undisturbed , eventually becoming the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the cmb is a powerful probe of cosmology due to the good theoretical understanding of the physical processes described above .",
    "the size of the sound horizon depends ( to first order ) only on the sound speed in the early universe and the age of the universe at recombination , both set by the physical matter and baryon densities , @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "hence , measuring the sound horizon in the cmb gives extremely accurate constraints on these quantities  @xcite .",
    "measurements of other cosmological parameters often show degeneracies in the cmb data alone  @xcite , especially in models with extra parameters beyond flat @xmath14cdm .",
    "combining low redshift data with the cmb can break these degeneracies .    within galaxy redshift surveys we can use the correlation function , @xmath20 , to quantify the clustering on different scales .",
    "the sound horizon marks a preferred separation of galaxies and hence predicts a peak in the correlation function at the corresponding scale .",
    "the expected enhancement at @xmath21 is only @xmath22 in the galaxy correlation function , where @xmath23 is the galaxy bias compared to the matter correlation function and @xmath24 accounts for linear redshift space distortions .",
    "since the signal appears at very large scales , it is necessary to probe a large volume of the universe to decrease sample variance , which dominates the error on these scales  @xcite .",
    "very interesting for cosmology is the idea of using the sound horizon scale as a standard ruler  @xcite .",
    "a standard ruler is a feature whose absolute size is known . by measuring its apparent size , one can determine its distance from the observer .",
    "the bao signal can be measured in the matter distribution at low redshift , with the cmb calibrating the absolute size , and hence the distance - redshift relation can be mapped ( see e.g.  @xcite for a summary ) .    the sloan digital sky survey",
    "( sdss ; @xcite ) , and the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) were the first redshift surveys which have directly detected the bao signal .",
    "recently the wigglez dark energy survey has reported a bao measurement at redshift @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "@xcite were able to constrain the distance - redshift relation to @xmath26 accuracy at an effective redshift of @xmath27 using an early data release of the sdss - lrg sample containing @xmath28 galaxies .",
    "subsequent studies using the final sdss - lrg sample and combining it with the sdss - main and the 2dfgrs sample were able to improve on this measurement and constrain the distance - redshift relation at @xmath29 and @xmath27 with @xmath13 accuracy  @xcite .",
    "other studies of the same data found similar results using the correlation function @xmath30 @xcite , the power spectrum @xmath31 @xcite , the projected correlation function @xmath32 of photometric redshift samples @xcite and a cluster sample based on the sdss photometric data  @xcite .",
    "several years earlier a study by  @xcite found first hints of the bao feature in a combination of smaller datasets .",
    "low redshift distance measurements can directly measure the hubble constant @xmath10 with a relatively weak dependence on other cosmological parameters such as the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the 6df galaxy survey is the biggest galaxy survey in the local universe , covering almost half the sky .",
    "if 6dfgs could be used to constrain the redshift - distance relation through baryon acoustic oscillations , such a measurement could directly determine the hubble constant , depending only on the calibration of the sound horizon through the matter and baryon density .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to measure the two - point correlation function on large scales for the 6df galaxy survey and extract the bao signal .",
    "many cosmological parameter studies add a prior on @xmath10 to help break degeneracies . the 6dfgs derivation of @xmath10 can provide an alternative source of that prior .",
    "the 6dfgs @xmath10-measurement can also be used as a consistency check of other low redshift distance calibrators such as cepheid variables and type ia supernovae ( through the so called distance ladder technique ; see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "compared to these more classical probes of the hubble constant , the bao analysis has an advantage of simplicity , depending only on @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the cmb and the sound horizon measurement in the correlation function , with small systematic uncertainties .",
    "another motivation for our study is that the sdss data after data release 3 ( dr3 ) show more correlation on large scales than expected by @xmath14cdm and have no sign of a cross - over to negative @xmath20 up to @xmath33mpc ( the @xmath14cdm prediction is @xmath34mpc )  @xcite .",
    "it could be that the lrg sample is a rather unusual realisation , and the additional power just reflects sample variance .",
    "it is interesting to test the location of the cross - over scale in another red galaxy sample at a different redshift .",

    "we introduce the 6dfgs survey and the @xmath35-band selected sub - sample used in this analysis . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we explain the technique we apply to derive the correlation function and summarise our error estimate , which is based on log - normal realisations . in section",

    "the 6df galaxy survey is a combined redshift and peculiar velocity survey covering nearly the entire southern sky with @xmath45 .",
    "it was undertaken with the six - degree field ( 6df ) multi - fibre instrument on the uk schmidt telescope from 2001 to 2006 .",
    "the median redshift of the survey is @xmath46 and the @xmath47 percentile completeness values are @xmath48 .",
    "papers by  @xcite describe 6dfgs in full detail , including comparisons between 6dfgs , 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "galaxies were excluded from our sample if they resided in sky regions with completeness lower than 60 percent . after applying these cuts",
    "our sample contains @xmath49 galaxies .",
    "the selection function was derived by scaling the survey completeness as a function of magnitude to match the integrated on - sky completeness , using mean galaxy counts .",
    "this method is the same adopted by  @xcite for 2dfgrs and is explained in  @xcite in detail .",
    "the redshift of each object was checked visually and care was taken to exclude foreground galactic sources .",
    "the derived completeness function was used in the real galaxy catalogue to weight each galaxy by its inverse completeness .",
    "the completeness function was also applied to the mock galaxy catalogues to mimic the selection characteristics of the survey .",
    "jones et al .",
    "( in preparation ) describe the derivation of the 6dfgs selection function , and interested readers are referred to this paper for a more comprehensive treatment .",

    "the parameter @xmath53 is crucial for the weighting scheme introduced later .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath54mpc@xmath55 ( corresponding to the value of the galaxy power spectrum at @xmath56mpc@xmath8 in 6dfgs ) minimises the error of the correlation function near the bao peak .",

    "we focus our analysis on the two - point correlation function . in the following sub - sections we introduce the technique used to estimate the correlation function and outline the method of log - normal realisations , which we employed to derive a covariance matrix for our measurement .      to calculate the correlation function we need a random sample of galaxies which follows the same angular and redshift selection function as the 6dfgs sample .",
    "we base our random catalogue generation on the 6dfgs luminosity function of jones et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , where we use random numbers to pick volume - weighted redshifts and luminosity function - weighted absolute magnitudes .",

    "we will discuss this further in section  [ sec : aandr ] .",
    "now we measure the separation between all galaxy pairs in our survey and count the number of such pairs in each separation bin .",
    "we do this for the 6dfgs data catalogue , a random catalogue with the same selection function and a combination of data - random pairs .",

    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this weighting is designed to minimise the error on the bao measurement , and since our sample is strongly limited by sample variance on large scales this weighting results in a significant improvement to the analysis .",
    "the effect of the weighting on the redshift distribution is illustrated in figure  [ fig : wred ] .",

    "in a magnitude limited sample there is a correlation between luminosity and redshift , which establishes a correlation between bias and redshift  @xcite .",
    "a scale - dependent weighting would imply a different effective redshift for each scale , causing a scale dependent bias .",
    "finally we considered a luminosity dependent weighting as suggested by  @xcite .",

    "[ ap : jk_comp ] we compare the log - normal errors with jack - knife estimates .",
    "+ log - normal realisations of a galaxy survey are usually obtained by deriving a density field from a model power spectrum , @xmath31 , assuming gaussian fluctuations .",

    "the assumption that the input power spectrum has gaussian fluctuations can only be used in a model for a density field with over - densities @xmath91 .",

    "in this section we will discuss wide - angle effects and non - linearities .",
    "we also introduce a model for the large scale correlation function , which we later use to fit our data .",
    "the model of linear redshift space distortions introduced by  @xcite is based on the plane parallel approximation .",
    "earlier surveys such as sdss and 2dfgrs are at sufficiently high redshift that the maximum opening angle between a galaxy pair remains small enough to ensure the plane parallel approximation is valid . however , the 6df galaxy survey has a maximum opening angle of @xmath114 and a lower mean redshift of @xmath115 ( for our weighted sample ) and so it is necessary to test the validity of the plane parallel approximation .",
    "the wide angle description of redshift space distortions has been laid out in several papers  @xcite , which we summarise in appendix  [ ap : wide ] .",
    "we find that the wide - angle corrections have only a very minor effect on our sample . for our fiducial model",
    "we found a correction of @xmath116 in amplitude at @xmath117mpc and @xmath118 at @xmath119mpc , ( figure  [ fig : wide2 ] in the appendix ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the error bars on these scales .",
    "despite the small size of the effect , we nevertheless include all first order correction terms in our correlation function model .",
    "it is important to note that wide angle corrections affect the correlation function amplitude only and do not cause any shift in the bao scale .",
    "the effect of the wide - angle correction on the unweighted sample is much greater and is already noticeable on scales of @xmath120mpc .",
    "weighting to higher redshifts mitigates the effect because it reduces the average opening angle between galaxy pairs , by giving less weight to wide angle pairs ( on average ) .",
    "there are a number of non - linear effects which can potentially influence a measurement of the bao signal .",
    "these include scale - dependent bias , the non - linear growth of structure on smaller scales , and redshift space distortions .",
    "we discuss each of these in the context of our 6dfgs sample .",
    "as the universe evolves , the acoustic signature in the correlation function is broadened by non - linear gravitational structure formation .",
    "equivalently we can say that the higher harmonics in the power spectrum , which represent smaller scales , are erased  @xcite .    the early universe physics , which we discussed briefly in the introduction ,",
    "is well understood and several authors have produced software packages ( e.g. cmbfast and camb ) and published fitting functions ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to make predictions for the correlation function and power spectrum using thermodynamical models of the early universe .",
    "these models already include the basic linear physics most relevant for the bao peak . in our analysis",
    "we use the camb software package  @xcite .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum in camb is calculated using the halofit code  @xcite .",
    "this code is calibrated by @xmath121-body simulations and can describe non - linear effects in the shape of the matter power spectrum for pure cdm models to an accuracy of around @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "however , it has previously been shown that this non - linear model is a poor description of the non - linear effects around the bao peak  @xcite .",
    "we therefore decided to use the linear model output from camb and incorporate the non - linear effects separately .",
    "all non - linear effects influencing the correlation function can be approximated by a convolution with a gaussian damping factor @xmath123 $ ]  @xcite , where @xmath101 is the damping scale .",
    "we will use this factor in our correlation function model introduced in the next section .",
    "the convolution with a gaussian causes a shift of the peak position to larger scales , since the correlation function is not symmetric around the peak .",
    "however this shift is usually very small .",
    "all of the non - linear processes discussed so far are not at the fundamental scale of @xmath124mpc but are instead at the cluster - formation scale of up to @xmath71mpc .",
    "the scale of @xmath124mpc is far larger than any known non - linear effect in cosmology .",
    "this has led some authors to the conclusion that the peak will not be shifted significantly , but rather only blurred out .",
    "for example ,  @xcite have argued that any systematic shift of the acoustic scale in real space must be small ( @xmath125 ) , even at @xmath126",
    ".    however , several authors report possible shifts of up to @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used re - normalised perturbation theory ( rpt ) and found percent - level shifts in the bao peak .",
    "in addition to non - linear evolution , they found that mode - coupling generates additional oscillations in the power spectrum , which are out of phase with the bao oscillations predicted by linear theory .",
    "this leads to shifts in the scale of oscillation nodes with respect to a smooth spectrum . in real space",
    "this corresponds to a peak shift towards smaller scales .",
    "based on their results ,  @xcite propose a model to be used for the correlation function analysis at large scales .",
    "we will introduce this model in the next section .      to model the correlation function on large scales , we follow  @xcite and  @xcite and adopt the following parametrisation , the different letters just specify whether the function is evaluated in redshift space or real space . ] : @xmath128 .",

    "here we explain in detail the different steps used to derive a log - normal mock catalogue , as a useful guide for researchers in the field .",
    "we start with an input power spectrum , ( which is determined as explained in section  [ sec : log ] ) in units of @xmath367mpc@xmath368 .",
    "we set up a 3d grid with the dimensions @xmath369mpc with @xmath370 sub - cells .",

    "will produce a 3d correlation function .",
    "since the power spectrum has the property @xmath377 the result will be real .",
    "the next step is to replace the correlation function @xmath378 at each point in the 3d grid by @xmath379 $ ] , where @xmath380 is the natural logarithm .",
    "this step prepares the input model for the inverse step , which we later use to produce the log - normal density field .    using a real - to - complex ft we can revert to @xmath381-space where we now have a modified power spectrum , @xmath382 . at this point",
    "we divide by the number of sub - cells @xmath383 .",
    "the precise normalisation depends on the definition of the discrete fourier transform .",
    "we use the fftw library  @xcite , where the discrete ft is defined as @xmath384.\\ ] ] the modified power spectrum @xmath382 is not guarantied to be neither positive defined nor a real function , which contradicts the definition of a power spectrum .",
    "@xcite suggested to construct a well defined power spectrum from @xmath382 by @xmath385\\right].\\ ] ] we now generate a real and an imaginary fourier amplitude @xmath386 for each point on the grid by randomly sampling from a gaussian distribution with r.m.s .",
    "@xmath387 . however , to ensure that the final over - density field is real , we have to manipulate the grid , so that all sub - cells follow the condition @xmath388 .",
    "performing another ft results in an over - density field @xmath389 from which we calculate the variance @xmath390 .",
    "the mean of @xmath389 should be zero . the log - normal density field",
    "is then given by @xmath391,\\ ] ] which is now a quantity defined on @xmath392 only , while @xmath389 is defined on @xmath393-\\infty,\\infty[$ ] .    since we want to calculate a mock catalogue for a particular survey we have to incorporate the survey selection function .",
    "if @xmath394 is the selection function with the normalisation @xmath395 , we calculate the mean number of galaxies in each grid cell as @xmath396 where @xmath107 is the total number of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the galaxy catalogue itself is than generated by poisson sampling @xmath397 .",
    "the galaxy position is not defined within the sub - cell , and we place the galaxy in a random position within the box .",
    "this means that the correlation function calculated from such a distribution is smooth at scales smaller than the sub - cell .",
    "it is therefore important to make sure that the grid cells are smaller than the size of the bins in the correlation function calculation . in the 6dfgs calculations presented in this paper the grid cells have a size of @xmath398mpc , while the correlation function bins are @xmath157mpc in size .",
    "we have also estimated jack - knife errors for the correlation function , by way of comparison .",
    "we divided the survey into @xmath219 regions and calculated the correlation function by excluding one region at a time .",
    "we found that the size of the error - bars around the bao peak varies by around @xmath399 in some bins , when we increase the number of jack - knife regions from @xmath219 to @xmath400 .",
    "furthermore the covariance matrix derived from jack - knife resampling is very noisy and hard to invert .",
    "we show the jack - knife errors in figure  [ fig : sigp0 ] .",
    "the jack - knife error shows more noise and is larger in most bins compared to the log - normal error .",
    "the error shown in figure  [ fig : sigp0 ] is only the diagonal term of the covariance matrix and does not include any correlation between bins .    the full error matrix is shown in figure  [ fig : matrix2 ] , where we plot the correlation matrix of the jack - knife error estimate compared to the log - normal error .",
    "the jack - knife correlation matrix looks much more noisy and seems to have less correlation in neighbouring bins .",
    "the number of jack - knife regions can not be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "each jack - knife region must be at least as big as the maximum scale under investigation .",
    "since we want to test scales up to almost @xmath33mpc our jack - knife regions must be very large .",
    "on the other hand we need at least as many jack - knife regions as we have bins in our correlation function , otherwise the covariance matrix is singular .",
    "these requirements can contradict each other , especially if large scales are analysed .",
    "furthermore the small number of jack - knife regions is the main source of noise ( for a more detailed study of jack - knife errors see e.g.  @xcite ) .    given these limitations in the jack - knife error approach , correlation function studies on large scales usually employ simulations or log - normal realisations to derive the covariance matrix .",
    "we decided to use the log - normal error in our analysis .",
    "we showed that the jack - knife errors tend to be larger than the log - normal error at larger scales and carry less correlation .",
    "these differences might be connected to the much higher noise level in the jack - knife errors , which is clearly visible in all our data .",
    "it could be , however , that our jack - knife regions are too small to deliver reliable errors on large scales .",
    "we use the minimum number of jack - knife regions to make the covariance matrix non - singular ( the correlation function is measured in @xmath219 bins ) .",
    "the mean distance of the jack - knife regions to each other is about @xmath33mpc at the mean redshift of the survey , but smaller at low redshift .",
