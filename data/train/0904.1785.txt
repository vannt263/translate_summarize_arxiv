    "in this paper , by presenting the shapes of the mass - independent potentials of kk modes in the corresponding schrdinger equations , we have investigated the localization and resonance spectrum of fermionic fields on a one - field generated @xmath1 thick brane .",
    "it is shown that , in order to localize left or right chiral fermions on the brane , some kind of kink - fermion coupling should be introduced .",
    "a class of kink - fermion couplings @xmath2 with positive @xmath4 and positive odd integer @xmath3 are investigated in detail .",
    "it is worth to point out that , in this @xmath1 thick brane scenario , the potential of kk modes of left chiral fermions is very different from the potentials of kk modes of the fields with spin 0 , 1 and 2 . for other spin fields ,",
    "the potentials of kk modes are the modified pschl - teller potentials , which suggest that there exist a mass gap and a series of continuous spectrum starting at positive @xmath188 @xcite . while the potential of kk modes of left chiral fermions is a modified volcano type potential .",
    "the potentials for both left and right chiral fermions vanish asymptotically when far away from the brane , hence all values of @xmath189 are allowed , and there exists no mass gap but a continuous gapless spectrum of kk states with @xmath189 .",
    "the massive kk modes asymptotically turn into continuous plane waves when far away from the brane .    for the simplest kink - fermion coupling @xmath66 ,",
    "the potential of kk modes of right chiral fermions is always positive at the brane location and vanishes when far away from the brane .",
    "this shows that the potential could not trap any bound fermions with right chirality and there is no zero mode of right chiral fermions .",
    "however , with the increase of @xmath4 , a potential well around the brane location appears and the well becomes more and more deeper .",
    "a set of massive fermions with a finite life - time ( resonances ) are obtained .",
    "we find that the masses and life - times of left and right chiral resonances are almost the same , which demonstrates that it is possible to compose a massive dirac fermion from the left and right chiral resonances .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the case of bound massive fermionic kk modes given in refs .",
    "@xcite , where mass spectrums of left and right chiral massive fermions are the same .    for the case",
    "@xmath74 with odd @xmath145 , the appearance of a well in the effective potential of right - handed fermions does not need large couple constant @xmath4 .",
    "especially , the potential well for left - handed fermions becomes a double - well .",
    "it is also shown that the spectrum of left - handed fermionic resonances is the same as that of the right - handed ones .",
    "the resonance with lower mass has longer life - time .",
    "for a same set of parameters , the number of resonances increases with @xmath3 and the life - time of the lower level resonance for larger @xmath3 is much longer than the one for smaller @xmath3 . for small @xmath153 and @xmath4",
    ", there is no resonances with long life - time .    at last ,",
    "we give a comment on the fact that either the left or the right resonance peaks at the brane s location itself . from the coupled equations ( [ coupleeq1 ] )",
    ", it can be seen that the massive kk modes with different chirality but same mass are in fact contacted with each other .",
    "since @xmath190 is odd , an odd left - chiral massive kk mode will correspond to an even right one with same mass , and vice versa .",
    "this results in the fact that either the left or the right resonance peaks at the brane s location itself .",
    "so , at the brane location @xmath80 , we can not get a massive resonance made of left and right chiral kk modes with same mass .",
    "this is to say , if we allow measurements only at @xmath80 , the massive resonances found on the brane are all chiral , and the evidence of dirac fermions is lost .",
    "however , in realistic thick brane models , branes are extended objects along the extra dimension .",
    "so we can interpret the probability for finding the massive modes on the brane ( not necessarily at @xmath80 ) as @xmath191 or more suitable as ( 25 ) , where the parameter @xmath192 is chosen in order to allow the influence of the odd modes in small regions around the brane location @xmath80 .",
    "according to this idea , the formation of metastable massive dirac fermions is realized , and those fermions are quasi - localized on the brane .",
    "similar discussions can also be found in refs .",
