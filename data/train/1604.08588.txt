    "within the context of the heterotic superstring and heterotic m - theory @xcite , there have been a number of vacuum states whose four - dimensional low energy effective field theory @xcite has the exact spectrum of the mssm  with or without right - handed neutrino chiral multiplets  and , to prohibit rapid proton decay , contains r - parity @xcite  either as a discrete symmetry or as a subgroup of an anomaly free @xmath4 extension of the standard model gauge group @xcite .",
    "one such vacuum was presented in @xcite and will be referred to as the @xmath0 mssm .",
    "be that as it may , this is only the first step in finding a realistic heterotic string vacuum .",
    "any such theory must also also be compatible with all presently observed low - energy phenomenology ; that is , it must spontaneously break electroweak ( ew ) symmetry at the observed scale , must be compatible with the newly discovered higgs particle with mass @xmath5  gev @xcite , have all sparticle masses above the present observational lower bounds and  assuming r - parity is contained in an additional @xmath4 symmetry ",
    "spontaneously break that abelian group with an associated gauge boson mass in excess of the present experimental lower bound .    in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 mssm was examined in detail  using a random statistical sampling of the initial set of soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking parameters  and the results confronted with these phenomenological requirements .",
    "it was shown , _ within a restricted region of the compactification moduli space , _ that the @xmath0 mssm easily passed each of these requirements for a large and basically uncorrelated set of initial conditions . furthermore , this analysis led to a series of low energy predictions  for example , directly relating the lightest stop decay channels and branching ratios to the neutrino mass hierarchy and mixing angles  thus linking lhc experimental results to neutrino measurements .",
    "that is , the @xmath0 mssm is a possible candidate for a phenomenologically acceptable theory of the real world  a statement that will be directly testable as its structure and predictions are confronted with upcoming data from the lhc , neutrino experiments and cosmological observations . for these reasons , in this paper we extend the results of @xcite to a _",
    "more general , and more natural , region _ of the @xmath0 mssm moduli space .    to quantify this",
    ", we should briefly discuss the structure of the @xmath0 mssm .",
    "it arises in the observable sector of heterotic m - theory compactified to four - dimensions on a shoen calabi - yau ( cy ) threefold @xcite with first homotopy group @xmath6 .",
    "this manifold admits a specific slope - stable holomorphic vector bundle @xcite with structure group @xmath7 , as well as two wilson lines  each wrapped over a two - cycle associated with a different @xmath8 homotopy factor",
    "this theory has three , in principle distinct , mass scales@xmath9 at which the gauge bundle spontaneously breaks @xmath10 to @xmath11 and two wilson line mass scales , which we denote by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , associated with the inverse radii of their respective two - cycles . in our previous analysis , we worked _ in a restricted region of cy moduli space _ where the radius of one two - cycle is distinctly smaller than that of the other ; that is , we chose @xmath14 . by taking the scale of separation of the two wilson lines to be approximately an order of magnitude , one can exactly unify all gauge coupling parameters thus specifying boundary conditions in the renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "however , this specificity comes at the cost of introducing an _",
    "additional scaling regime_. between @xmath13 and @xmath12 the effective theory is that of the `` left - right '' model @xcite with gauge group @xmath15 and a specific particle spectrum that can be computed from string theory .",
    "it is only for energy - momentum below the lightest wilson line mass @xmath12 that one obtains the spectrum and @xmath16 gauge symmetry of the @xmath0 mssm .    in this paper , we generalize and simplify the phenomenological analysis of the @xmath0 mssm by working in a _",
    "generic _ region of cy moduli space where the radii of the two wilson lines and the average radius of the cy manifold are all approximately equal : that is , with @xmath17 .",
    "this generalization is significant in that 1 ) _ the region of moduli space is much larger and more `` natural '' _ than that used previously and 2 ) _ the `` left - right '' scaling region is eliminated _ , with the @xmath0 mssm emerging immediately below the compactification scale  thus simplifying the scaling regimes .",
    "of course , the four @xmath0 mssm gauge couplings will no longer unify near the scale of the cy radius .",
    "this does somewhat complicate the rg analysis .",
    "however , it opens the door for a discussion of unification of all gauge couplings with the gravitational coupling at the `` string scale''as has been discussed by many authors in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , such unification should take place at tree level .",
    "however , at the one - loop ( and higher ) level one expects such unification to be split by `` threshold '' corrections .",
    "these are due to several effects , such as the inclusion of field theory thresholds at each of the susy , @xmath0 and `` unification '' scales , and genus - one string theory corrections .",
    "since in this analysis the latter is expected to be the largest , we will focus exclusively on them . by running the four @xmath0 mssm gauge parameters up to the string scale",
    ", we will 3 ) _ statistically compute the heavy string threshold corrections for each gauge coupling_. furthermore , we will statistically compute the hypercharge gauge threshold and , by subtracting various thresholds , analyze the moduli dependent sub - component of each .",
    "finally , there is yet another important benefit of analyzing the @xmath0 mssm at the generic region of its cy moduli space ",
    "although we will not pursue this in the present paper . in our previous work and the present analysis ,",
    "the scale of the soft susy breaking parameters is chosen to be in the tev region .",
    "this is done in order for our low energy phenomenological predictions to be lhc accessible . however , unlike in the case of unified gauge couplings enforced by splitting the wilson line masses discussed in @xcite  which , for reasons elucidated in the conclusion , is essentially restricted to the tev region  for the simultaneous wilson line masses discussed in this paper , the susy breaking mass scale can be taken to be arbitrarily large .",
    "this has a number of important applications , both in particle phenomenology and in early universe cosmology @xcite .",
    "we will pursue this in future work @xcite .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the salient parts of the @xmath0 mssm theory , presenting the spectrum , the supersymmetric and the soft susy breaking lagrangians , discussing the generic structure of spontaneous @xmath0 and ew symmetry breaking and setting our notation .",
    "section iii is devoted to defining the exact meaning of the `` simultaneous '' wilson line analysis presented in this paper  as opposed to the `` split '' wilson line approach in our previous work .",
    "it then discusses , in detail , the four relevant mass scales from `` unification '' to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the statistical definitions of the `` unification '' mass and gauge coupling are given in our present context . in section iv ,",
    "the three scaling regimes  for both the `` right - side - up '' and `` upside - down '' scenarios  along with the associated gauge coupling beta function parameters are presented .",
    "the rg running of the yukawa couplings , including their transition at the susy scale , is discussed .",
    "section v gives a brief review of the `` statistical '' approach to setting the initial soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the `` unification '' scale presented in detail in our previous work . in section vi , the experimental constraints on the sparticle masses , the heavy vector boson mass and the lightest neutral higgs mass are presented .",
    "we then solve the rges  for randomly chosen initial soft susy breaking parameters sequentially from the `` unification '' scale down through the ew breaking scale subject to these constraints .",
    "plots  and the exact number  of the initial points that sequentially satisfy the experimental constraints are given ; ending with the robust number of phenomenologically `` valid '' black points that satisfy all experimental constraints .",
    "a brief analysis of both the lsp and non - lsp spectra is then given . in section vii ,",
    "we briefly discuss fine - tuning in the @xmath0 mssm . in section viii ,",
    "we statistically calculate the heavy string threshold corrections for each of the four @xmath0 mssm gauge couplings , as well as the hypercharge gauge threshold , and analyze the moduli dependent differences of these quantities .",
    "finally , in section ix , we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the minimal anomaly free extension of the mssm with gauge group @xmath18 whose structure was motivated by heterotic string theory in @xcite and by phenomenological considerations in @xcite .",
    "although this model has been discussed in our previous papers @xcite , we outline its main features in this section for specificity and to set our notation .",
    "the abelian gauge factors @xmath19 can be rotated into physically equivalent charge bases , such as @xmath20 . however , as shown in  @xcite , this comes at the cost of introducing kinetic mixing between the gauge fields .",
    "we therefore prefer to work in the basis @xmath19 .",
    "the gauge covariant derivative is d =- ig_3ri_3rw_3r - ig_blb^  , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the generators and couplings for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 groups respectively .",
    "the gauge boson associated with @xmath26 is denoted @xmath27 to distinguish it from the gauge boson associated with @xmath28 , which is normally denoted @xmath29 .",
    "the factor of @xmath30 in the last term is introduced by redefining the gauge coupling @xmath24 , thus simplifying many equations .",
    "a radiatively induced vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a right - handed sneutrino will break the abelian factors @xmath31 to @xmath28 , in analogy with the way the mssm higgs fields break @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "this process is referred to as `` @xmath0 '' symmetry breaking , although technically it breaks a specific combination of the groups generated from @xmath21 and @xmath22 , leaving invariant the usual hypercharge group generated by y = i_3r +  .",
    "the particle content of the model is simply that of the mssm plus three right - handed neutrino chiral multiplets .",
    "this amounts to three generations of matter superfields @xmath34 along with the usual two higgs supermultiplets @xmath35 where we have displayed their @xmath36 quantum numbers .",
    "the superpotential of the @xmath0 mssm is given by @xmath37 where both generational and gauge indices have been suppressed . in principle , the yukawa couplings are three - by - three complex matrices .",
    "however , the observed smallness of the ckm mixing angles and cp - violating phase imply that the quark yukawa matrices can be approximated as diagonal and real for the purposes of rg evolution in this paper .",
    "the charged lepton yukawa coupling can be made diagonal and real by moving the pmns angles and phases into the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "the small size of neutrino masses implies that the neutrino yukawa couplings can be neglected for the purposes of rg evolution in this paper .",
    "the smallness of first- and second - generation fermion masses implies that first and second - generation yukawa quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings can also be neglected .",
    "the @xmath38-parameter can be chosen to be real without loss of generality .",
    "the soft supersymmetry breaking lagrangian is @xmath39 where generation and gauge indices have been suppressed .",
    "the @xmath40-parameters and sfermion soft - mass terms can , in principle , be hermitian matrices in family space .",
    "however , this tends to lead to unobserved cp violation .",
    "therefore , we proceed assuming that they are diagonal and real . furthermore , as discussed in section v , we assume that the a - parameters are proportional to the yukawa couplings .",
    "this implies that all the @xmath40-parameters can be neglected except for the ( 3,3 ) component of the quark and charged lepton @xmath40-parameters .",
    "the @xmath41-parameter can be chosen to be both real and positive without loss of generality .",
    "although the gaugino soft masses can be complex in principle , this tends to lead to unobserved flavor and cp violation .",
    "therefore , we proceed assuming that they are real .    the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vev in a right - handed sneutrino , which carries the appropriate @xmath21 and @xmath42 charges to break those symmetries while preserving hypercharge symmetry .",
    "this vev is brought about by a sneutrino soft - mass term becoming tachyonic at the tev scale due to the rge evolution .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , this vev will be purely in one of the three right - handed sneutrino generations  not in a linear combination of them .",
    "furthermore , the three generations of right - handed sneutrinoes can be relabeled without loss of generality .",
    "therefore , we henceforth assume that it is the third - generation right - handed sneutrino that acquires a vev .",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken by vevs in the neutral components of the up and down higgs multiplets .",
    "the electroweak breaking vevs and the @xmath0 breaking vev together lead to small vevs in all three generations of left - handed sneutrinos .",
    "the above vevs will be denoted by v_r ,   _ i ,   v_u ,   v_d , where @xmath43 is the generation index .",
    "the neutral gauge boson that becomes massive due to @xmath0 symmetry breaking is referred to as @xmath44 .",
    "defining @xmath45 , and assuming that @xmath46 , @xmath47 acquires to leading order a mass of m_z_r^2 = ( g_3r^2+g_bl^2 ) v_r^2  .",
    "[ eq:237 ] the hypercharge gauge coupling is given by [ eq : y.3r.bl ] g_y = g_3r _ r = g_bl_r  , where _ r =  . the smallness of the neutrino masses implies , first , that the neutrino yukawa couplings are small and , second , that the left - handed sneutrino vevs are much smaller than the electroweak scale . in this limit , the minimization conditions of the potential simplify to @xmath48 noting from above that @xmath49 , equations and can be combined to give [ eq : mzr.mnuc ] m_z_r^2 = -2 m_^c_3 ^ 2  .",
    "the vev in the third - generation right - handed sneutrino induces spontaneous bilinear r - parity violation through the operators @xmath50 where @xmath51 bilinear r - parity violation has been discussed extensively , including its relevance to neutrino masses .",
    "see , for example , some early works  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of this model contains additional bilinear terms due to the sneutrino vevs : @xmath52      \\\\      &      -\\frac{1}{2 } v_r \\left[-g_r \\nu_3^c \\tilde w_r + g_{bl } \\nu_3^c \\tilde b ' \\right]+ \\text{h.c . }",
    "\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the r - parity violating terms in this model have a variety of interesting consequences that have been studied in a number of different contexts .",
    "these include lhc studies  @xcite , predictions for neutrinos  @xcite , and connections between the two  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the r - parity violation can give rise to majorana neutrino masses , with the lightest left - handed neutrino being massless .",
    "there is also a pair of sterile right - handed neutrinos that can have cosmological implications  @xcite .    the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 model , reviewed in this section , will be referred to simply as the @xmath0 mssm throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "we now turn to connecting the phenomenology of the @xmath0 mssm to its high - scale origins .",
    "specifically , we are considering the possibility that the @xmath0 mssm is the observable sector of the low - energy effective theory of an @xmath53 heterotic string theory . in this context , the @xmath0 mssm gauge group unifies into an @xmath11 gauge group , which is itself the commutant of the @xmath54 structure group of the observable sector @xmath10 vector bundle on the cy threefold .",
    "we have previously studied the @xmath0 mssm in this context  @xcite . in this paper , however , we will study the effects of string threshold corrections on gauge unification .",
    "this requires a discussion of gauge unification  to which we now turn .",
    "this section outlines the scales and scaling regimes associated with the evolution of the @xmath0 mssm from `` unification '' to the electroweak scale .",
    "compactification to four dimensions yields a unified gauge group , @xmath11 , at mass scale @xmath9 .",
    "this unified gauge group is broken by two abelian wilson lines , denoted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the mass scales associated with these wilson lines , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , depend on the inverse radii of the 2-cycles over which they are wrapped .",
    "these , in turn , depend on the chosen point in the cy moduli space .",
    "generically , one expects that the two wilson line masses are approximately the same and close to the @xmath11 unification scale .",
    "that is , one `` naturally '' expects @xmath57 over a wide region of the cy moduli space .",
    "however , as one moves away from these generic points the wilson line mass scales need not remain the same .",
    "this leads to an intermediate regime between the two scales associated with the wilson lines .",
    "the particle content and gauge group in this intermediate regime depends on which wilson line has a higher associated mass .",
    "if @xmath14 , the particle content and gauge group of the intermediate regime is that of a `` left - right '' model . if @xmath58 , the particle content and gauge group of the intermediate regime is similar to that of a``pati - salam '' model",
    "in each case , the lower - mass wilson line breaks the model in the intermediate regime to the @xmath0 mssm .",
    "in fact , it was shown in  @xcite that exact gauge coupling unification at one - loop _ requires _ that these scales be different .",
    "for specificity of the rge calculation , it was convenient to _ impose _ precise gauge coupling unification .",
    "hence , in  @xcite we studied the two cases with separated wilson line masses  even though this can occur only in special regions of moduli space . under the assumption that the soft susy breaking masses be of tev order  to assure that sparticle masses potentially be lhc accessible  we found that gauge coupling unification dictates that the wilson line scales must be separated by less than / approximately an order of magnitude in either case .",
    "additionally , we found that both cases lead to similar low energy phenomenology .",
    "hence , for specificity , we carried out our analysis using the first of these symmetry breaking patterns ; that is , the intermediate regime containing the `` left - right '' model .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for that analysis . here , for concreteness , we simply show in figure [ fig : mu.mi.msusy ] the relationship of the @xmath59 unification scale to that of the mass @xmath12 of the the second wilson line in the `` left - right '' model case .",
    "this is plotted as a function of @xmath60  defined below in eq . .",
    "unification mass and @xmath12 as functions of the susy scale in the `` left - right '' scenario . ]    in this paper , we turn to the analysis of the _ generic _ region of moduli space where equation , that is , @xmath17 , is satisfied , thereby _ giving up exact gauge unification_. be that as it may , to enable direct comparison of our new simultaneous wilson line results with those from the split wilson lines analyzed in  @xcite , we continue to use the same notation for all quantities .",
    "in particular , it is important to use identical notation for the @xmath0 gauge coupling .",
    "thus far in this paper , we have discussed the gauge parameter @xmath24 , which couples to the @xmath61 generator . however , as was discussed in  @xcite , this gauge coupling has to be properly normalized so as to unify with the other gauge parameters in the split wilson line scenarios .",
    "the appropriate coupling was denoted @xmath62 and defined by g_bl = g_bl  .",
    "even though the four gauge couplings , including @xmath63 , will not unify in the simultaneous wilson line scenario in this paper , we will continue to use this parameter when appropriate .",
    "note that @xmath62 couples to the @xmath64 generator and will appear in the rges . for quantities of physical interest , such as physical masses , @xmath24 will be used .    to fully understand the evolution of this model from `` unification '' to the electroweak scale ,",
    "it should be noted that there are four relevant mass scales of interest .",
    "all four are described in the following : + * @xmath65 : the unification and the first and second wilson lines mass scale .",
    "*    since , as discussed above , exact unification of the four gauge couplings no longer occurs for simultaneous wilson lines , it is essential to give a justification  and an explicit definition  of what we mean by the `` unification mass '' in the present context . in  @xcite ,",
    "every phenomenologically valid point in the space of randomly chosen initial soft supersymmetry breaking parameters corresponds to an explicit unification mass @xmath9 and unified coupling @xmath66 .",
    "both the unification scale and unification parameter vary for different valid points .",

    "the values of the four diverse couplings @xmath70 and @xmath71 at @xmath68 will be determined for each statistical choice of soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "henceforth , for specificity , we will always take this unification scale and both wilson line masses to be strictly identical ; that is @xmath72 + * @xmath73 : the mass at which the right - handed sneutrino vev triggers @xmath74 symmetry breaking .",

    "<S> for specificity of calculation , unification of the gauge parameters was enforced by allowing the two @xmath1 wilson lines to have mass scales separated by approximately an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this introduced an additional `` left - right '' sector below the unification scale . in this paper , for three important reasons , we modify our previous analysis by demanding that the mass scales of the two wilson lines be simultaneous and equal to an `` average unification '' mass @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis is 1 ) more `` natural '' than the previous calculations , which were only valid in a very specific region of the calabi - yau moduli space , 2 ) the theory is conceptually simpler in that the left - right sector has been removed and 3 ) in the present analysis the lack of gauge unification is due to threshold effects  particularly heavy string thresholds , which we calculate statistically in detail . as in our previous work , </S>",
    "<S> the theory is renormalization group evolved from @xmath2 to the electroweak scale  being subjected , sequentially , to the requirement of radiative @xmath0 and electroweak symmetry breaking , the present experimental lower bounds on the @xmath0 vector boson and sparticle masses , as well as the lightest neutral higgs mass of @xmath3125 gev . </S>",
