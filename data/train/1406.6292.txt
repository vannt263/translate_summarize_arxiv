    "kondo insulators are a peculiar group of rare - earth materials , which behave as metals with magnetic moments above a characteristic temperature ( @xmath1 k ) and become semiconductors at low temperatures due to strong correlations.@xcite gaps are opened in both the spin and charge sectors , and they are in the order of a few mev , which defines the small energy scale of these compounds .",
    "these small gaps can not be understood in a simple band picture , since the strong interaction between the electrons plays a crucial role .",
    "furthermore this is the reason why different energy scales arise in the spin and charge sectors .",
    "the minimal model for the kondo insulators is the half - filled periodic anderson model@xcite ( pam ) . in its one - dimensional version",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath2 where the notation is standard and @xmath3 is taken as the energy unit .",
    "the spin and charge gaps of the one - dimensional pam have been studied by several methods in the past decades .",
    "the exact diagonalization studies@xcite pointed out that both the charge and spin gaps are finite .",
    "this analysis was later confirmed and refined by the density - matrix renormalization - group calculations @xcite .",
    "both methods showed that the charge gap is always larger than the spin gap , and decreases much more slowly than the spin gap as @xmath4 is incresed and their ratio diverges in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "later on , this inequality was rigorously proven for the ordinary periodic anderson model and it was shown that it remains valid for a @xmath5-dimensional simple cubic lattice as well .",
    "@xcite the charge and spin gaps are also directly measurable quantities using optical and neutron scattering measurements , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that for numerous compounds the experimental ratio of the gaps is less than one , which is in qualitatively good agreement with the theoretical predictions for the one - dimensional pam , and in some cases , like ceru@xmath6sb@xmath7 or cefe@xmath6sb@xmath7 , even quantitative agreement can be achieved with the theoretical predictions.@xcite however , for cerhas the ratio of the spin@xcite and charge gaps@xcite was found to be greater than one , namely , @xmath8 , which can not be understood at all in the frame of the ordinary periodic anderson model.@xcite one of the major aims of the present paper is to provide a possible explanation to the problem .",
    "several extensions of the pam have been considered lately , to model the effect of further electron - electron interactions .",
    "the role of conduction electron interaction in the kondo lattice model and pam has been thoroughly investigated.@xcite recently , the correlations between conduction and f electrons have been shown to play an important role to understand the critical valence fluctuations.@xcite this interaction term leads to the extended pam ( epam ) : @xmath9 this model has been investigated by several modern techniques recently,@xcite and the valence transition has been explained successfully . however , less attention has been paid to the kondo insulator case.@xcite it has been shown recently using dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , which is exact for infinitely large dimensions that in the symmetric case for small hybridization ( @xmath10 ) the model displays antiferromagnetic order for small @xmath0 which , however , disappears for large @xmath0 and charge order develops . in the charge ordered phase doubly occupied c and f sites appear in an alternating fashion , since the c and f electrons tend to avoid each other . since these results were obtained via dmft , which neglects spatial fluctuations , one can naturally ask what happens in low - dimensional systems , where the fluctuations are more important .",
    "our purpose in this paper is therefore to examine the one - dimensional epam .",
    "naturally , we do not address the possibility of the presence of long - range order that was found in infinite dimensions .",
    "we apply the density - matrix renormalization - group method@xcite ( dmrg ) , which is a powerful tool to find the ground state and the first few excited states .",
    "further advantage of the dmrg method is that we can determine the von neumann entropies@xcite of single and multisite subsystems , which turned out to be very good indicators of drastic changes in the wavefunction.@xcite they are known to exhibit anomalous behavior where the character of the ground state changes dramatically .",
    "the setup of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "our numerical results are presented for the spin and the charge gaps of the extended periodic anderson model . in sec .",

    "our conclusions are presented .",
    "for convenience the epam has been implemented in the dmrg procedure as a generalized hubbard model with a special topology .",
    "the site @xmath11 with both c and f electrons is replaced by two dmrg sites , one for the conduction electrons , the other for the f electrons , and therefore instead of working with 16 states per site , only 4 states per dmrg sites have to be considered .",

    "open boundary condition is applied , and we considered chains up to a maximum length @xmath20 and finite - size scaling is used to extrapolate the quantites to the thermodynamic limit .    in the following , we consider the half - filled symmetric epam for moderately large @xmath4 .",
    "we address first the effect of @xmath0 on the spin and charge gaps of the epam .",
    "the spin gap is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the ground - state energy in the given @xmath23 subspace , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total spin and particle number , respectively .",
    "the latter one is @xmath26 in the half - filled case .",

    "nevertheless , we see a clear tendency as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_chain ] that the spin gap increases monotonically with @xmath39 for all system sizes we considered .",
    "since we know that the spin gap is finite for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a scaling constant,@xcite we conclude that the spin gap is always finite .    , for several chainlengths at @xmath36 , @xmath38 .",

    "it can be seen that this crossing point slightly shifts toward smaller @xmath0 values as @xmath48 is increased .",
    "the sharp increase of the spin gap around and above the crossing point can be understood as follows . here",
    "the c and f electrons try not to occupy the same site .",
    "since the total number of f electrons is @xmath18 in the symmetric model , and the same holds for the conduction electrons , the two kinds of electrons can best avoid each other by dominantly occupying every second site , the odd sites with two f electrons and the even sites with two conduction electrons , or vice versa .",
    "since the doubly occupied sites are necessarily in a singlet state , a spin flip can be achieved by transferring an electron to another site and a local singlet has to be broken up for that . for @xmath0 larger than the value at the crossing point ,",
    "there are a large number of singlet excited states with lower energy .",
    "they determine the density - density correlations and therefore the gap to the lowest of them is considered as the charge gap , in agreement with eq .",

    "the decrease or increase of the gap with @xmath0 is reflected in the variation of the decay length .",
    "a naive estimate of the correlation length from the linear fit to the data would give @xmath55 , for @xmath42 .",
    "although such a large decay length can not be obtained reliably from calculations on chains with 50 sites , it can be taken as an order of magnitude estimate , corroborating our expectations .",
    "namely , such large values of @xmath56 can be explained with the known behavior of the ordinary pam . as has been pointed out,@xcite the correlation length of the spin correlation function increases exponentially by increasing @xmath4 .",
    "as long as @xmath0 is below the crossing point the spin correlation function is dominant due to the tiny spin gap .",
    "the spin correlation length decreases while the density correlation length increases as @xmath0 is increased . above the crossing point ,",
    "the density correlation function has the longer correlation length which corresponds to the peculiar behavior of the charge gap .",
    "knowing that one can not have true long - range order in one dimension , but slowly decaying correlations might indicate ordering in higher dimensions , we might guess that strong @xmath0 leads to charge ordering , as indeed it was found in the dmft calculation.@xcite    it is interesting to examine the spin correlation between f and conduction electrons on the same site .",

    "a peak is developed , where the entropy of f electrons takes its maximum value , @xmath78 , then it begins to decrease and approaches @xmath77 again , since for large @xmath0 an f site is expected to be either doubly occupied or empty . for larger",

    "concerning the conduction electrons , their entropy is @xmath78 as long as @xmath79 , since they are free particles . above the crossover value , the probability of finding zero or two c electrons on the same site increases from 1/4 to 1/2 , so correlation is developed between c electrons .",
    "it is readily observed that there should be a remarkable change in the ground state , where the entropy of f electrons has a maximum .",

    "the lines are guides to the eye . ]    for weak hybridization it drops rather drastically around @xmath0 corresponding to the crossover point and then starts to increase slowly , while for stronger hybridization the decrease of the site entropy is less drastic .",
    "but in both cases @xmath58 is much smaller above @xmath57 than below this value .",
    "a nearly vanishing @xmath58 is indication that the wave function is dominated by terms localized to this site .    to better reveal the reason of these anomalies we calculated the mutual information between c and f type electrons on sites @xmath11 and @xmath69 for several values of @xmath0 . the mutual information for @xmath42 is shown in fig . [ fig : mutual_inf_ucf0 ] for weak hybridization .",
    "it is easy to observe that moderately strong but short - ranged entanglement is developed between c electrons and much weaker between c and f electrons due to the small hybridization . on the other hand",
    "long - ranged but weaker entanglement is formed between the f electrons .",
    "this is the consequence of the strong rkky - interaction , which results in the antiferromagnetic correlations between the f electrons ; the f electrons form a collective singlet .",

    "these conclusions have been obtained for finite systems , therefore we have to investigate the finite - size effects .",
    "for @xmath42 the entanglement bonds show strong dependence on the chain length , while for @xmath93 and @xmath94 the above results are very close the bulk limit for @xmath95 already .",

    "one can naturally ask what the relevant physical process is in creating the strong onsite bonds around the crossing point and for stronger @xmath0 . to answer this question we examined the eigenvalues ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) of the two - site density matrix @xmath71 . for @xmath42 we found that several eigenvalues of @xmath98 are of the same order of magnitude and the eigenvectors contain all basis states @xmath99 , except for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "however , for @xmath93 one of the eigenvalues of @xmath98 becomes almost two orders of magnitude larger than the others .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction reads : @xmath102 it is seen that the configuration in which the site is occupied with two f electrons in a singlet state or two conduction electrons in a singlet state has roughly the same weight as the state in which a conduction and an f electron form a singlet .",
    "the latter configuration was observed in the spin correlation function in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfsd ] and corresponds to the enhanced spin kondo - effect .",

    "further increase of @xmath0 results in the suppression of the singlet part in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavefunction : ucf1.75 ] ) .",
    "for example for @xmath103 , the eigenfunction corresponding to the most significant eigenvalue is : @xmath104 parallel with the suppression of the c - f singlets , two f or two conduction electrons occupy more and more this site .",
