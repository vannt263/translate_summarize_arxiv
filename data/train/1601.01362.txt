    "the physical properties of a constrained quantum gas come from the effects of the external potentials and the interactions between particles .",
    "here we are giving a detailed description of the effects of the constraints on the bose gas properties before to address a more complete description including interactions .",
    "let us consider a 3d ideal bose gas ( ibg ) within a lattice composed by multiple slabs .",
    "the bosons are free to move in the @xmath3 an @xmath4 directions .",
    "the lattice is modeled through a kronig - penney potential in the @xmath5 direction , with potential barriers of width @xmath1 separated a distance @xmath2 , so the potential period , or the lattice period , is @xmath6 .",

    "the energy spectrum consist of a series of allowed energy bands separated by forbidden regions , where the positive side of the @xmath20-th band extends from @xmath21 to @xmath22 with @xmath23 ... .",
    "the fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite shows the energy spectrum , and the allowed energy bands , in terms of the dimensionless parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for @xmath27 .",
    "pi squared times our energy unit @xmath28 is equivalent to the recoil energy of an 1d optical lattice formed by the interference of two counter - propagating light beams of wavelength equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 represents the lattice height ( or depth ) in our energy unit , and the quotient @xmath31 indicates how wide are the barriers with respect to the lattice period .",
    "it also indicates if a lattice is square ( @xmath32 ) or rectangular ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we obtain the thermodynamic properties of the bose gas from the grand potential @xmath34 . in order to find the bose - einstein critical temperature @xmath35 we use the number equation , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of bosons occupying the ground state , and @xmath38 is the number of bosons distributed over excited states . at @xmath39",
    ", @xmath40 is the energy of the ground state of the system , and all the bosons are distributed over the excited states , @xmath41 .",
    "the number equation becomes @xmath42 with @xmath43 . from the last eq .",
    "( [ eq : critical - temperature - equation ] ) we obtain the critical temperature @xmath35 in an implicit way , which is numerically calculated .",
    "our system size is infinite , and it has an infinite number of bosons , but the average particle density @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "an infinite ibg with the same average density but with no external potential has a critical temperature given by @xmath45^{2/3}$ ] , where @xmath46 is the riemann zeta function of argument @xmath47 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath48 is a good reference parameter for temperatures as well as the thermal wavelength @xmath49 is a good reference parameter for lengths , in particular for the critical temperature @xmath0 and the potential spatial period @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we previously found @xcite that , when @xmath51 the critical temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of this parameter .",
    "however , in order to observe separately the effects of the spatial period variation as well as the increasing of the potential height on the critical temperature , in this section we find it convenient to replace @xmath30 by @xmath52 which is period independent and it depends exclusively on changes of the potential magnitude @xmath16 .",
    "the behavior of the critical temperature as a function of @xmath53 ( instead of @xmath30 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - curvesp_r-1 ] , for @xmath32 , i.e. , the width of the barriers is equal to the separation between them . in the same figure",
    "each curve of @xmath54 corresponds to a particular value of the period of the potential .",
    "we can see that @xmath35 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath53 : when the magnitude of the potential barriers is small @xmath35 is approximately @xmath48 , then it falls as @xmath53 increases , and for sufficiently high potential barriers the critical temperature is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath56 we clearly see that @xmath0 is very close to @xmath57 , even for very high potential barriers .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that , when the potential period becomes very small with respect to @xmath58 , the energy spectrum of the bosons approaches more and more to that of a free particle , so @xmath0 tends to @xmath48 .",
    "it seems as if the thin potential wells are unable to capture bosons and all of them have energies above @xmath16 behaving as a free ibg .        in the other hand",
    ", we found that when @xmath59 \\ , r\\sqrt{\\tilde{u}_0 } / ( 1+r ) \\gg       1 $ ] , the energy bands whose energies are less than @xmath60 are very narrow , and they resemble the energy levels of a particle in a box of width @xmath2 . in this case",
    "we can approximate the energies of the first band through a taylor series up to second order derivatives of @xmath61 around @xmath62 , @xmath63 the linear term on @xmath64 is zero because @xmath65 is a minimum of the energy . using this approximation , and taking the condition that @xmath66 , the behavior of @xmath54 is given by the relation @xmath67 which is potential period independent",
    ", therefore @xmath54 depends only on @xmath60 and @xmath31 . when @xmath68 the second term of becomes negligible , and we obtain the concrete dependence of the critical temperature shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - curvesp_r-1 ] as a solid thin line , @xmath69 the numerical results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - curvesp_r-1 ] supports that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc - limit - behavior - large - u0 ] ) is an excellent limit relation when @xmath60 is very large in comparison with @xmath70^{-2}$ ] , even when @xmath71 is smaller than unity .",
    "the behavior of @xmath35 as a function of the potential period can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - curvesa0_r-1 ] , where we note that @xmath35 approximates to @xmath48 when the potential period is small , then it falls as the period increases , and finally it goes to a certain value that is @xmath60 and @xmath31 dependent , but becomes @xmath71 independent .",
    "this constant value is given by solving .",
    "it is interesting to see how the critical temperature does not necessarily approaches to @xmath57 again as the potential period keeps increasing , unlike the case of a dirac comb potential @xcite .",
    "even when the empty space between barriers becomes larger ( as well as the barriers width ) , the distribution of the bosons over the bands is very different to that of the free bose gas .",
    "the dependence on @xmath53 and @xmath31 that appears on the first term of comes from the distribution of the bosons over the first energy band .",
    "the dependence on @xmath31 in the second term of comes from the boson distribution over the rest of the bands . only in the case",
    "when @xmath72 the critical temperature is @xmath57 .",
    "this is expected because @xmath73 means no barriers , i.e. , @xmath74 , or @xmath75 while @xmath1 remains constant . in both cases",
    "it is clear why we recover the behavior of the free bose gas .",
    "we have calculated the specific heat at constant volume for several combinations of the parameters ( see fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the specific heat has a peak due to the bose - einstein condensation of the confined ibg at a critical temperature @xmath76 . above @xmath0",
    "the specific heat has a complex structure , and for some combinations of the parameters of the system it shows a dimensional crossover within an interval of temperatures where it falls to a minimum approximately equal to unity ; in this interval the system behaves as a 2d gas , trapped by the potential in one direction but remaining free in the other two .",
    "the minimum , which is a consequence of the trapping effects imposed by the potential barriers could become a plateau when the potential magnitude is increased .",
    "in addition to the minimum , the specific heat has two maxima .",
    "the maximum at the lower temperature marks the crossover from the 3d behavior of the gas to a 2d behavior .",
    "the maximum at higher temperature represents the return of the system to its three - dimensional behavior or it may be seen as the superior limit of the temperature interval where the crossover occurs .    in order to give a explanation about the meaning and position of the specific heat maxima in terms of the energy spectrum characteristics , we realized a contour plot of @xmath77 as a function of @xmath71 and @xmath78 , for a system with @xmath79 and @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cv - contour_u0 - 100_r-1 ] ) where the maximum positions are highlighted with bright yellow .",
    "when we associate the temperature of the maxima @xmath80 with a yet unknown energy chunk @xmath81 characteristic of the energy spectrum such that @xmath82 , we found that both lower and higher maxima temperatures follow the relation @xmath83 where @xmath84 , the energy chunk given in recoil energy unit divided by @xmath85 , has a different value depending on whether we are describing the maximum at lower or higher temperature .",
    "the maximum that occurs at the higher temperature is reproduced using an energy @xmath84 given by the difference between the bottom edge of the first energy band and the bottom edge of the second energy band . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : cv - contour_u0 - 100_r-1 ] this is shown with white circles .",
    "the maximum at the lower temperature occurs when @xmath84 is approximately equal to @xmath86 of the width of the first energy band . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : cv - contour_u0 - 100_r-1 ] this relation is shown with white diamonds .    as a more general result , it is found that as the magnitude of @xmath87 increases the energy chunk needed to reproduce the @xmath80 of the maximum at higher temperatures , eventually corresponds to the energy difference between the bottom edges of the first and the third , fourth or subsequent bands of the confined bose gas energy spectrum .",
    "an example of this behavior is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv - contour_u0 - 500_r-1 ] for the system with @xmath88 and @xmath27 , where the energy chunk @xmath84 associated to the maximum at the higher temperature corresponds to the difference between the bottom edges of the third and first band .",
    "however , the dependence of the energy chunk on @xmath87 and @xmath31 is not trivial to find , and currently we have no analytical expression to determine it .",
    "it is noticeable that , to reproduce the maximum at lower temperature with expression ( [ eq : crossover - t - edge ] ) we always use @xmath84 approximately to @xmath86 of the width of the first energy band of the spectrum , i.e. , in this case @xmath84 value is potential strength independent .",
    "in summary , we analyzed the behavior of the bec critical temperature of an ibg confined by an infinite stack of slabs as well as the effects of the external periodic potential on the dimensional crossover , the specific heat maximum positions and their relation with the distribution of allowed and forbidden bands in the energy spectrum .",
    "we found that the critical temperature @xmath35 decreases continuously as the potential barrier height increases , and it becomes proportional to @xmath89 when @xmath60 is much larger than @xmath70^{-2}$ ] .",
    "it is found that this behavior is _ universal _ as it does not depends on the potential period , the barrier width nor the barrier separation .",
    "in addition , we found that as the period increases the @xmath35 becomes a constant value given by eq .   which is spatial period independent .",
    "on the other hand , the specific heat at constant volume shows a dimensional crossover within a certain interval of temperatures where it behaves like a 2d gas due to the trapping by the potential barriers .",
    "the region where the dimensional crossover occurs as well as the specific heat maximum positions depend directly on the forbidden and allowed bands distribution in the energy spectrum .",
    "we were able to find a relation between the maximum positions and characteristic energies of the energy spectrum .",
    "although the specific heat maximum position , at higher temperature , is reproduced using the eq .",
    "with @xmath84 the energy difference between the bottom edges of the second and first bands , or , depending on the potential strength , the difference between the bottom edges of the third and first , the bottom edges of the fourth and first and so on , we highlight that the specific heat maximum position at the lower temperature is reproduced using the eq .   with @xmath84 being potential strength independent and equal to @xmath86 of the width of the first band .",
