    "the following result will be applied to the case when @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath11    let @xmath0 be a subspace of @xmath42 that is closed in @xmath41 and @xmath42 so that the subspace topologies induced by @xmath41 and @xmath42 coincide .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .    by hypothesis",
    ", the identity map from @xmath0 with its topology as a subspace of @xmath41 to @xmath0 with its topology as a subspace of @xmath42 is continuous .",
    "hence it must be bounded from which the conclusion follows.@xmath52    note that by the hypothesis in our main theorem , the above result applies to @xmath0 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we next show that a space @xmath0 satisfying the hypothesis of the main theorem is finite dimensional .",
    "let @xmath4 be a closed manifold and let @xmath0 be a subspace of @xmath53 such that there exists @xmath50 such that for @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath0 is finite dimensional .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is infinite dimensional , then let @xmath55 denote an @xmath29-orthonormal sequence in @xmath0 . by hypothesis , for all @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . by the rellich lemma it follows that the sequence @xmath59 has a convergent sequence in @xmath29 .",
    "but , as the vectors @xmath59 are @xmath29-orthonormal , this is impossible .",
    "thus , @xmath0 must be finite dimensional.@xmath52",
    "we can now construct elliptic differential equations satisfied by the functions in @xmath0 at a single point @xmath38 . choose a system of local coordinates . observe that partial derivatives at @xmath39 give linear functionals on @xmath0 , i.e. , elements of the dual @xmath60 of @xmath0 .",
    "these generate a subspace @xmath61 of @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath60 is finite dimensional , @xmath61 is generated by finitely many partial derivatives , and hence those of order at most @xmath62 for some @xmath62 .",
    "we denote these differential operators by @xmath63 ,  , @xmath64 .",
    "now let @xmath65 be an elliptic operator of order greater than @xmath62 , for instance a power of the laplacian .",

    "we can find finitely many such sets @xmath77 whose union is @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the maximal degree of the differential operators associated to these sets .",
    "now , let @xmath65 be an elliptic operator of order greater than @xmath62 .",
    "for each @xmath77 , we have differential operators @xmath63,  ,@xmath64 which are independent at each @xmath78 and hence span @xmath61 .",

    "hence the laplacian ( with respect to an analytical metric ) is an analytical elliptic operator on @xmath4 and so are it powers .",
    "it follows that there are analytical elliptic differential operators on @xmath4 of arbitrarily high orders .    in the rest of this section",

    "we construct inductively analytic elliptic operators @xmath160 ,  , @xmath161 with @xmath161 being the required operator .",
    "first , note that on @xmath162 , we can find an operator @xmath163 , with analytical coefficients , of order at most @xmath154 so that @xmath164 for all @xmath165 , @xmath5 .",

    "next , observe that on @xmath167 , the function @xmath158 does not vanish , and hence the operator @xmath168 is well - defined .",

    "this annihilates @xmath0 on @xmath167 by construction and also on @xmath173 as it coincides with @xmath160 on @xmath173 .",
