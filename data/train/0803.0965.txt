    "since the discovery of the high - temperature superconductors , the normal - superconducting phase transition has attracted great interest , partially due to the larger critical region which comes from the high critical temperature and short coherence length of these materials.@xcite there has been a great deal of work investigating the phase transition in both zero and non - zero magnetic field .    in zero field",
    ", measurements of penetration depth,@xcite magnetic susceptibility,@xcite specific heat@xcite and thermal expansivity@xcite largely agree that the static critical exponent @xmath3 ( governing the divergence of the correlation length @xmath4 ) , and indicate that the phase transition in zero field belongs to the 3d - xy universality class .",
    "the dynamics of the transition , measured through transport properties , remains uncertain .    in principle",
    "conductivity measurements , which depend on the nature of the dynamics of the order parameter near @xmath1 , can determine both the static critical exponent @xmath5 and dynamical critical exponent @xmath6 governing the divergence of the fluctuation lifetime ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 are expected to be universal , but values extracted from conductivity measurements are not consistent .",
    "for example , dc conductivity measurements yield a wide range of values for critical exponents : @xmath8 to @xmath9.@xcite    ac measurements can determine both the real and imaginary parts of the fluctuation conductivity , providing a stringent test of critical dynamics.@xcite measurements over a broad frequency range allow us to probe the dynamical behavior of the system and directly measure the fluctuation lifetime.@xcite however these experiments are difficult and seldom done , and the available results are inconsistent , with values of @xmath6 ranging from 2 to 5.6 .",

    "recently sullivan _ et al .",
    "_ argued that a finite - size effect at low current density was the reason for previous inconsistent results in dc measurements.@xcite the question of whether the finite - size effect influences the ac measurement and the extracted critical exponents , as in dc measurements , inspires us to study the power dependence of the microwave fluctuation conductivity .",
    "we find that several length scales play a role in ac conductivity measurements , and only after their effects are properly accounted for can the underlying critical dynamics be understood .",
    "our samples are ybco films(@xmath20100 nm to 300 nm thickness ) deposited via pulsed laser deposition .",
    "ac susceptibility showed @xmath1 of the films around 90 k with transition widths about 0.2 k. the resistivity of the films is about @xmath21-cm at 2 k above @xmath1 .",

    "both magnitude and phase of the fluctuation conductivity look similar to the ideal sketch .",
    "however , as frequency decreases the measured magnitude of the fluctuation conductivity below @xmath1 saturates , instead of bending up .",
    "all of the phase isotherms below @xmath1 tend toward zero , indicating ohmic response , instead of approaching @xmath22 at low frequency .",
    "these deviations are qualitatively similar to the low current - density deviations of e vs. j in dc measurements.@xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig : powercompare ] also shows that the applied microwave power affects the measured fluctuation conductivity , particularly at low frequencies . as frequency decreases ,",
    "the higher applied microwave power decreases the magnitude of the fluctuation conductivity and depresses the phase .",
    "these phenomena can be explained using scaling theory .",
    "since the critical point is located in the limit of zero magnetic field @xmath23 , current density @xmath24 and frequency @xmath25 , increased applied current should drive the system further away from the transition and thus into the ohmic regime .",

    "the two remaining terms are @xmath30 and @xmath31 . qualitatively , at low frequency , @xmath31 is small compared to @xmath30 so that the applied power has more effect on the fluctuation conductivity .    to illustrate the effect of different powers , @xmath32 vs. microwave power at different frequencies",

    "the fluctuation conductivity is almost power independent .",
    "the important features in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerdependence ] are that large applied power affects the fluctuation conductivity , and that even small power depresses the fluctuation conductivity at low frequency .",
    "while the high - frequency and high - power data in fig.[fig : powerdependence ] can be explained by ffh scaling theory@xcite , the low - power low - frequency behavior is not explained by these theories alone .",
    "the similarity between this low power and low frequency deviation and the low current density deviation in dc conductivity measurement suggests the presence of a `` probed length scale '' for a finite frequency . in a simple physical model",
    ", fluctuations can be visualized as closed circular vortex loops of radius r. in an infinite superconductor with no applied current , vortex loops of different size occur with different probabilities as thermal fluctuations .",
    "when a current with density j is applied , some vortex loops(with large r ) will blow out to infinite size(dissipation ) . some vortex loops(with small r ) shrink and annihilate(no dissipation ) .",
    "the current density induced length scale @xmath34 , which can be written as @xmath35,@xcite separates vortex loops into two categories , depending on their ultimate fate .",
    "the shrinking of a vortex takes time .",
    "the shrinking time depends on the size of the vortex , thus relating the size of a vortex to a time scale . in ac measurements",
    ", small frequency means that large length scales are probed , so one investigates large size vortex loops , and _",
    "vice versa_. from the order parameter relaxation time scale in time - dependent ginzburg landau theory@xcite one can construct a frequency - induced length scale @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant of order 1 and @xmath38 .",
    "in ac conductivity measurements , the probed length scale involves both frequency and current density . among them ,",
    "the smaller length scale dominates the measured fluctuation conductivity .",
    "we propose a plausible expression for the probed length scale for ac measurement @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "this formula has the correct limits , and it is also consistent with the two - term ffh scaling , without the magnetic term @xmath29 .",
    "finite size effects come into play when @xmath39 approaches the thickness of the film .",
    "[ fig : aclengthscales ] summarizes the length scales in an ac measurement in terms of experimental quantities . in this figure",
    ", we use @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath18 .",
    "the dotted line in the figure gives the boundary @xmath43 . to the right and below the dotted line ,",
    "when @xmath44 , the frequency induced length scale dominates , and one observes mainly frequency dependent behavior of the fluctuation conductivity . above the dotted line , when @xmath45 , current - induced nonlinear effects will dominate the behavior .",
    "this explains the features shown in fig.[fig : powercompare ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : powerdependence ] , where the current density has less effect on the fluctuation conductivity at high frequency and a larger effect at low frequency .    at low frequency and small current density",
    ", @xmath39 may approach the thickness of the sample ( _ d _ ) or some other length scale that interrupts the fluctuation vortex loops .",
    "hence deviations from the simple scaling theory are expected when @xmath46 .    in our ac measurements",
    ", we want to keep @xmath47 .",
    "hence we choose to stay at low @xmath24 but high @xmath25 .",
    "in this region we can find the true critical behavior without getting into finite - size effect or crossover difficulties .",
    "our previous analysis strayed out of this region and may account for the larger values of @xmath6 reported before@xcite and elsewhere in the literature .    with very small applied microwave power , -46dbm , and high frequency data , we investigated the frequency dependent fluctuation conductivity around @xmath1 .",
    "we found that the determination of @xmath1 is crucial for obtaining critical exponents . with high quality data taken at small temperature intervals (",
    "50 mk),@xcite first we improved the conventional data analysis method@xcite to determine @xmath1 .",
    "we did a quadratic fit for @xmath48 vs. @xmath49 and determined @xmath1 through the sign of the @xmath50 coefficient of the quadratic fit , and the slope of the linear fit.@xcite in addition , we developed a new method to determine @xmath1 .",
    "inspired by the wickham and dorsey scaling function @xmath51@xcite , we choose scaling parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 at each temperature to collapse @xmath54 vs. @xmath55 and @xmath56 vs. @xmath55 to smooth and continuous curves , without _ a priori _ determination of @xmath1 or critical exponents.@xcite then we extracted the critical temperature and exponents by forcing @xmath52 and @xmath53 to show power - law behavior near @xmath1 . by combining the two methods the critical temperature and exponent for sample xuh139 were determined , @xmath57.@xcite    the dynamic critical exponent should be sample independent .",
    "to check the results , we not only repeated measurements on the same sample , but also repeated the experiment on different samples .",
    "films of different thickness(@xmath20100 nm to 300 nm ) were examined , and z was found to be independent of the thickness , keeping in mind the constraints of fig .  [",
    "fig : aclengthscales ] . experiments on 6 samples have been done giving @xmath58 .",
    "we also performed dc current - voltage characteristic measurements on the same samples.@xcite typical results are shown in fig.[fig : figure4].(with no background subtraction@xcite ) according to the negative curvature criterion@xcite , we determined the critical temperature to be @xmath59 k and the critical exponent @xmath60 from the derivative plot in fig.[fig : figure4](b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] , all the isotherms tend towards ohmic behavior at low current density , brought about by @xmath61 finite - size effects.@xcite when the current density is smaller than @xmath62 , the sample will have only ohmic response around @xmath1 .",
    "the -46dbm applied power in ac measurement corresponds to a maximum current density of @xmath63(@xmath64 ) .",
    "this means that for -46dbm incident power @xmath61 , verifying a feature of fig.[fig : aclengthscales ] , and suggesting that one - parameter scaling should work when @xmath65 .",
    "hence it is appropriate to determine @xmath1 and critical exponents with ac data at -46dbm applied power .",
    "the difference of @xmath1 between dc and ac measurements is due to the different thermometer positions and temperature control techniques of the two systems .",
    "the resistance vs. temperature plots from the ac and dc experiment have a 2.0 k temperature offset , which is the difference of the determined @xmath1 from these two methods .",
    "hence the determined @xmath1 from the two methods are consistent .",
    "performing dc measurements on the same film after ac measurements involves more processing steps than a dc measurement alone , and may result in additional disorder in the sample .",
    "disorder and heating leads one to systematically choose a lower temperature isotherm as @xmath1 and then obtain a larger value of @xmath6.@xcite we carefully repeated the measurements on different ybco films and found that the sample quality does affect the obtained value of @xmath6 from the dc experiment.@xcite however , for films with high @xmath1 , sharp transition and small resistivity , we obtained a value of @xmath66 from dc measurement , which is consistent with the ac result @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , dc measurements carried out the same way on high - quality crystals also gave @xmath67.@xcite    in this work , we focused on temperatures very close to @xmath1(the reduced temperature @xmath68 ) and finite - frequency scaling .",
    "in this temperature range , due to the influence of the finite size effect at low frequencies the static critical exponent @xmath5 can not be determined.@xcite    to conclude , using two different measurement methods , we studied the dynamic fluctuation effects of @xmath0 thin films around @xmath1 .",
    "the combination of ac and dc measurements precisely determined the dynamical scaling exponent @xmath69 , which suggests the superconducting to normal phase transition of high-@xmath1 materials is consistent with model e - dynamics.@xcite"
