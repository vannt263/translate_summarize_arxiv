    "high order series expansions have become a powerful tool in the field of strongly correlated electron systems @xcite . especially in low dimensional quantum spin systems significant progress has been achieved , see e.g.  [ 2 - 6 ] . usually the obtained truncated series must be extrapolated using various extrapolation schemes in order to obtain results for the physically interesting regions @xcite .",
    "albeit these extrapolations are a standard technique they always introduce some uncertainty about the results . therefore , a general transformation scheme which allows to read off the information content of the high order series more directly is highly desirable",

    ", the results for @xmath27 are shown . the truncated series for @xmath27 yields a satisfactory agreement up to @xmath29 . beyond this value",
    "it can not be used as estimate for the value of the gap .",
    "more sophisticated extrapolation schemes , however , still work fine .",
    "generically , the various physical quantities in a given system depend in a complicated way on the external control parameters . expanding the quantities under study in terms of one of the external control parameters ,",
    "let us say @xmath30 , yields the bare , truncated series which can only rarely be directly used to compute the quantities .",
    "this is so since singularities induced by phase transitions easily spoil the convergence of the series .",
    "for instance , a correlation length diverges and the corresponding energy gap closes rendering an expansion about the gapped phase difficult .    if the convergence of the series is deteriorated due to an incipient phase transition it is reasonable to assume that _ all _ quantities in the particular system behave in a similar fashion .",
    "if this is so we may proceed in two separate steps : ( i ) we extrapolate an internal parameter which may serve as a measure of the distance to the phase transition as reliably as we can .",
    "thereby , we can attribute reliably to a given value of @xmath30 the corresponding value of the internal parameter .",
    "( ii ) we express all _ other _ quantities as functions of the internal parameter . according to our argument",
    "the latter functional dependencies are expected to be much simpler , i.e.  they are much less singular .",
    "the canonical candidate for the internal parameter measuring the distance to a phase transition or , more generally , to some singular situation is the energy gap @xmath31 .",
    "it is inversely proportional to the correlation length @xmath32 which plays the role of the internal control parameter in standard renormalization group treatments .    in the following ,",
    "we illustrate for the 1-triplet dispersion of the model in ( [ h_start ] ) that this scheme works indeed stunningly well . the gap @xmath27 can be extrapolated reliably up to @xmath33 using dlogpad - approximants , fig",
    ".  1a . in this extrapolation",
    "we can exploit additional properties of the gap such as its positivity and its asymptotic behavior for @xmath18 . in this way ,",
    "very reliable extrapolations are possible ( fig .",
    "1a ) so that step ( i ) is successfully solved .",
    "note that @xmath27 in units of @xmath34 does not vanish on @xmath18 but rests finite @xcite .    for step ( ii )",
    "we define @xmath35 in units of @xmath36 the gap is unity at @xmath37 and it goes to zero on @xmath18 .",
    "so @xmath38 varies monotonically between 0 and 1 when @xmath30 is increased from 0 to @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 , i.e.  @xmath25 , constitutes the limit where the spin ladder becomes a system of two isolated spin chains .",
    "since one has @xmath41 for small @xmath30 any expansion in @xmath30 can be rewritten as expansion in @xmath42 of the same order as the series in @xmath30 , yet with other coefficients !",
    "this is done by inverting eq .",
    "[ g ] , thus completing the second step .",
    "we applied the extrapolation scheme proposed above to the expansions of the 1-triplet hopping amplitudes @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ disp ] which yields the 1-triplet dispersion @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "1b the results are depicted for the truncated series in @xmath42 without any further extrapolation ! for @xmath45",
    "the dispersion is a monotonic decreasing function in @xmath46 whereas for larger values of @xmath30 a characteristic dip at @xmath47 appears . for comparison ,",
    "the limiting case of isolated chains is also included @xcite .",
    "the main point is that the truncated series in @xmath42 gives a quantitatively correct 1-triplet dispersion up to @xmath48 ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) and qualitatively good results up to @xmath33 while the truncated series in @xmath30 can be trusted only up to @xmath29 .",
    "we presented a novel generally applicable extrapolation scheme for high order series expansions .",
    "the basic idea is to use an _ internal _ control parameter instead of an _ external _ control parameter as expansion variable .",
    "all difficulties stemming from singularities are dealt with in the determination of the dependence of the internal parameter on the external one .",
    "the power of the novel scheme was demonstrated for the 1-triplet dispersion of the antiferromagnetic @xmath0 2-leg heisenberg ladder .",
    "further investigations on other quantities and systems are in progress . in addition , the use of standard extrapolation techniques on the series in the internal parameter constitutes a very promising route to extend the applicability of strong coupling expansions .",
