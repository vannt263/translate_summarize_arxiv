    "the situation in ngc  2419 is completely different , especially because fe and other fe - peak elements show no variation in ngc  2419 .      ignoring h and he , the most abundant elements in a scaled solar mixture are c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe . of these , c , n , o , ne , and s all have high first ionization potentials , @xmath50  ev .",
    "thus , in the atmospheres of cool stars , mg , si , and fe are the dominant sources of free electrons , and of these three , mg has the lowest first ionization potential , and hence may be the most important .",
    "we have established that there is a substantial population of luminous giants in ngc  2419 with a very large deficiency of mg .",
    "given the potential importance of mg to the structure of the stellar atmosphere , we must consider the potential implications of such a large deficiency .",
    "we investigated the structure of the model atmospheres , in part , in response to the suggestion by @xcite that the induced change in electron pressure , @xmath51 , affects the cat enough to produce the observed dispersion in line strengths in ngc  2419 .",
    "if the mg abundance were to be increased from some initial level , one would expect @xmath51 to rise , and to continue rising as the mg abundance is increased further .",
    "however , decreasing the mg abundance from some initial level does not produce the same behavior , as once mg is sufficiently depleted , it will no longer be an effective electron donor compared to other sources of electrons , and any additional decrease in @xmath51 will occur much more slowly .",
    "thus , whatever the effect may be of the strong mg depletion seen in the mg - poor group of rgb stars in ngc  2419 , we should not expect a very large range in behavior arising from the large range in the depletion of mg within the mg - poor population in ngc  2419 .",

    "it is clear from the calculations of @xcite that the position of the rgb will _ not _ be perceptibly altered in this situation .",
    "we initially expected , based on the substantial shifts in the rgb found by @xcite at higher metallicity , that the mg - rich and mg - poor populations in ngc  2419 would be separated in the rgb with the mg - poor population lying somewhat to the blue of the main rgb .",
    "however , cmds using both @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see fig .  [ figure_cmd ] ) show this is not the case . understanding that no such shift is expected to happen for the specific case of ngc  2419 relieves our initial concern .",
    "it would maintain the validity of our normal methods of stellar parameter determinations , especially @xmath39 , which rely on broad band colors .",
    "( however , we do not use colors here , instead relying on @xmath28 alone . )",
    "it also gives specific guidance for the special case of the star s1673 , which is the most mg - depleted star in our sample .",
    "it lies somewhat to the blue in the @xmath28 , @xmath29 cmd , but less so in @xmath28 , @xmath30 .",

    "type  ii sn nucleosynthesis models including ejection mechanisms , fallback , and mixing within the ejecta can successfully explain the chemical inventory of ( most ) emp galactic halo stars @xcite . if one wishes to invoke peculiar type  ii sn explosions to explain the anomalies in the chemical inventory of ngc  2419 , since it is ( even now ) a very massive gc , just one peculiar type  ii sn may not eject enough material to produce a population of mg - poor stars which comprises @xmath4530% of the present cluster stars .",
    "speculation that multiple , peculiar type  ii sne occurred in ngc  2419 and in no other known gc seems rather ad hoc and therefore unsatisfactory .",
    "the depletion of mg among the mg - poor stars we have found in ngc  2419 is unprecedented among metal - poor stellar systems of any age or total mass .",
    "@xcite calculated the effect of single - element enhancements on gc isochrones . at the low metallicity ( @xmath7 } \\sim -2.1 $ ] ) of this gc",
    ", they found very small changes on the rgb position in the cmd . at higher",
    "metallicity , @xcite found substantial changes in the positions of the rgb in a simple stellar population such as gc .",
    "furthermore , augmentations in mg ( or ca ) relative to fe would have even larger consequences than depletions .",
    "the same holds true for the effects induced by a change in the abundance of a specific element with regard to the line strengths of individual spectral features , both those of the element involved , and those of other elements through the effect of a change in @xmath51 and hence a change in ionization ratios .",
    "spectral features originating from an ionization stage which contains only a small fraction of the total atoms of the relevant element can be significantly altered in strength .",
    "the rgb plus agb dominate the total light at optical and ir wavelengths in old stellar populations . in these cool stars",
    ", it is the population and potentially the line strength of the neutral vs.  the singly ionized species that may be affected .",
    "if large divergences in the abundance of a single ( abundant , low first ionization potential ) element from the scaled solar ratio or the normal @xmath8-enhanced ratio do occur in simple stellar systems , then the consequences for the study of more distant stellar systems , where only the integrated light can be observed , may be profound .",
    "for example , the calibrations relating [ m / h ] and the mg triplet line indices for the lick indices @xcite , widely used to interpret moderate resolution spectra of galaxies and gcs beyond the local group , will be altered .",
    "substantial star - to - star variation within a gc of the abundances of crucial elements could mimic a variation of overall metallicity or an age spread . by increasing the number of parameters that must be considered ,",
    "possible variations in the abundances of key individual elements add considerable complexity to the interpretation of the their cmds .",
    "so far only ngc  2419 shows such behavior in its chemical inventory , and since this is such a metal - poor gc , the effects on its cmd are very small , and the effects on its spectrum only appear in the lines of elements that are actually abnormal in their abundances . while finding many more such cases , especially at higher metallicity ,",
    "would be very interesting , for the sake of our entire knowledge base of the composite light of simple stellar systems , we must hope that such cases are very rare .",
    "our initial work on the extremely distant and massive outer halo gc ngc  2419 ( @xcite ) used moderate resolution spectra from keck / deimos .",
    "we suggested the presence of a star - to - star spread in [ ca / h ] but no detectable spread in [ fe / h ] based on an analysis of the strong near - ir triplet and spectral synthesis of weaker , neutral lines .",
    "we then proceeded ( @xcite ) to obtain high - dispersion spectra of a sample of stars , most of which appeared to be normal , @xmath8-enhanced red giants similar to those found in most gcs . but",
    "@xcite s sample also contained one very peculiar star , s1131 , which showed very depleted mg and highly enhanced k and was apparently ca - rich as well .",
    "to follow this up , in this paper we presented abundance analyses of 6 new rgb stars in ngc  2419 , most selected to be among the most apparently ca enhanced in the study of @xcite .",
    "we found that there are two groups of stars in ngc  2419 , one of which is identical to the typical gc @xmath8-enhanced rgb stars .",
    "the second group , which contains roughly 1/3 of the stellar population of this gc , is very peculiar .",
    "these stars have extremely depleted mg , ranging down to @xmath53 dex below the solar ratio , i.e. , about a factor of 15 below the normal - mg stars .",
    "these mg - poor stars are identical to those with apparently high ca from @xcite , and from the present detailed abundance analyses show highly enhanced k , moderately enhanced sc , and a small enhancement of si and ca compared to the mg - normal stars .",
    "but there is no credible evidence for any variation of [ fe / h ] within this gc .",
    "this chemical inventory is unprecedented and unique .",
    "we discussed whether some of this behavior , in particular the apparent enhancement in ca , can be attributed to low @xmath51 in the stellar atmosphere arising from the depletion of mg , an important electron donor at low temperature when h is neutral .",
    "we concluded that the small difference in ca abundance ( @xmath45 0.2  dex ) between the mg - poor and mg - normal giants is real .",
    "a number of suggestions have been offered for for producing some of these peculiarities , which do very rarely occur in other gc and field halo stars , without invoking a real difference in chemical inventory between the mg - poor and mg - normal giants .",
    "we provided evidence against the suggestion by @xcite that unusually strong turbulence in the upper atmospheres of the stars might produce the apparent excess of k , at least in the case of ngc  2419 .",
    "we looked at the variation with stellar parameters and with metallicity of the non - lte corrections for each of the relevant elements . in the end",
    ", we concluded that all of these variations , correlations , and anti - correlations involving mg , k , sc , ca , and si are real differences in mean abundances between the mg - poor and mg - normal population .",
    "it is not too difficult to imagine slightly altering the characteristics of type  ii sne ( their mass distribution , the explosion energy , the fallback , etc . ) to reproduce the behavior of sc and k. we have not found a similar solution for mg , ca , and si . even the explanation for sc and k is unsatisfactory because it requires multiple type  ii sne to be peculiar with respect to those sne that produced the material in all other known gcs .",
    "in addition to the mg - k anti - correlation and related issues that we have found , there is evidence that the usual correlations and anti - correlations among the light elements characteristic of proton - burning at high temperature that are seen in most gcs are present in ngc  2419 as well , and may be accompanied by @xmath77-process enhancements among some of the heavy neutron capture elements .",
    "but the two signs of multiple populations act independently in ngc  2419 ; the na - poor and na - rich giants do not correspond at all with the mg - poor and mg - normal giants in this peculiar gc .    with the present work",
    ", we now have a clear view of the complex chemical inventory within ngc  2419 and of the extremely peculiar mg - poor population which which contains roughly 1/3 of its stellar population .",
    "however , we have not found a solution to the puzzle of how to reproduce through nuclear reactions the characteristics of the mg - poor population in ngc  2419 .",
    "one puzzle was unveiled by @xcite , @xcite , and the present work , but another has now been revealed and is at present without any satisfactory solution .    with this new evidence demonstrating the uniqueness of ngc  2419 among the milky way system of gcs , we repeat the suggestion we made in @xcite that ngc  2419 is not a gc . instead , it may be the nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "although it presently has no dark matter @xcite and a gravitational potential well unlikely to retain supernova ejecta , it may have previously resided in a dark matter halo , such as an accreted dwarf galaxy .",
    "m54 , the core of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy , likely shares the same origin @xcite , and a similar story has been suggested for @xmath75  cen @xcite .",
    "if ngc  2419 joins this growing category of clusters , then it will be unique among its class for retaining some ( e.g. , ca , sc , k ) but not all ( e.g. , fe ) supernova products .",
    "we are grateful to the many people who have worked to make the keck telescope and its instruments a reality and to operate and maintain the keck observatory .",

    "<S> we present new keck / hires observations of six red giants in the globular cluster ngc  2419 . </S>",
    "<S> although the cluster is among the most distant and most luminous in the milky way , it was considered chemically ordinary until very recently . </S>",
    "<S> our previous work showed that the near - infrared triplet line strength varied more than expected for a chemically homogeneous cluster , and that at least one star had unusual abundances of mg and k. here , we confirm that ngc  2419 harbors a population of stars , comprising about one third of its mass , that is depleted in mg by a factor of 8 and enhanced in k by a factor of 6 with respect to the mg - normal population . </S>",
    "<S> although the majority , mg - normal population appears to have a chemical abundance pattern indistinguishable from ordinary , inner halo globular clusters , the mg - poor population exhibits dispersions of several elements . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances of k and sc are strongly anti - correlated with mg , and some other elements ( si and ca among others ) are weakly anti - correlated with mg . </S>",
    "<S> these abundance patterns suggest that the different populations of ngc  2419 sample the ejecta of diverse supernovae in addition to agb ejecta . however </S>",
    "<S> , the abundances of fe - peak elements except sc show no star - to - star variation . </S>",
    "<S> we find no nucleosynthetic source that satisfactorily explains all of the abundance variations in this cluster . because ngc  2419 appears like no other globular cluster , we reiterate our previous suggestion that it is not a globular cluster at all , but rather the core of an accreted dwarf galaxy . </S>"
