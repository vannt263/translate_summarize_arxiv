    "to investigate the spin structure of the nucleon smc studies deep inelastic scattering of polarised muons off polarised protons and deuterons . from the measured longitudinal asymmetries",
    "the spin structure functions , @xmath3 , can be extracted by @xmath4 the depolarisation factor @xmath5 gives the polarisation transfer from the lepton to the nucleon and increases with the energy transfer .",
    "@xmath6 is the unpolarised structure function .    in the quark parton modell ( qpm )",
    "@xmath3 is related to the quark helicity distributions functions , @xmath7 , by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the negative square of the four momentum transfer , bjorken @xmath10 the momentum fraction carried by the struck quark and @xmath11 the quark charge .",
    "the notation @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) refers to parallel ( antiparallel ) orientation of the quark and the nucleon spins .",
    "the first moments @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be used to study the contribution of quark helicities to the nucleon spin and to test the ellis - jaffe @xcite and bjorken @xcite sum rules .    the first measurement of the ellis - jaffe sum rule for the first moment of @xmath16 by the emc @xcite showed a strong violation of the sum rule . interpreted in the qpm this pointed to a very small contribution of quark helicities to the proton spin and a negative polarisation of the strange sea quarks .",
    "this led to a series of new experiments at cern , slac and also at desy studying the spin structure of the proton and the neutron in more detail .",
    "these new data also allow to test the fundamental bjorken sum rule @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the structure function data are precise enough to perform next - to - leading order perturbative qcd analyses and determine the polarised parton distributions .",
    "the smc experiment ( na37 ) was located at the m2 muon beam line of the cern sps and took data using polarised proton and deuteron targets from 1992 to 1996 .",
    "the 190 and 100 gev muon beam with about @xmath18 per 2.2  s spill was naturally polarised .",
    "the polarisation was determined by two independent measurements using a dedicated second spectrometer downstream of the main experiment .",
    "the first method measured the energy spectrum of the decay electrons from muon decay , the second one used the cross section asymmetry in polarised muon electron scattering @xcite .",
    "the results were @xmath19 at 187.4  gev and @xmath20 at 99.4  gev .",
    "the heart of the experiment was the polarised solid state target .",
    "it was polarised using dynamic nuclear polarisation in a 2.5  t longitudinal field of a superconducting magnet .",
    "the target temperature was maintained at @xmath21  mk during normal operation by a dilution refrigerator . from 1992 to 1995 smc used butanol or deuterated butanol as target material whereas for the 1996 data taking ammonia was chosen improving the dilution factor @xmath22 by 30% from about 0.13 for butanol to about 0.17 for ammonia .",
    "the target was divided into two cells of 65  cm length polarised in opposite directions . to reduce systematic uncertainties due to changes in the detector response",
    "the target polarisation was reversed every 5  hours by rotating the magnetic field with the help of an additional 0.5  t dipole magnet .",
    "the average longitudinal polarisation was @xmath23 for protons and @xmath24% for deuterons .",
    "it was measured to an accuracy of 2 - 3% using 9 nmr coils embedded in the target material .",
    "in addition to the continuous measurement of the proton polarisation the polarisation of @xmath25 was determined in dedicated measurements @xcite and found to depend on the proton polarisation as predicted by the equilibrium spin temperature relation .",
    "typical nitrogen polarisations were @xmath26 for proton polarisations of @xmath27 .",
    "the scattered muons and the produced forward going hadrons were detected in an open forward spectrometer using about 150 wire chamber planes placed upstream and downstream of a large gap dipol magnet . due to the large number of wire planes",
    "the measured asymmetries were hardly sensitive to occasional problems with single planes .",
    "there was no particle identification for hadrons , but electron hadron separation was obtained with the help of a lead / iron scintillator calorimeter .    the measured counting rates for longitudinal beam and target polarisations were used to determine the raw asymmetry @xmath28 which is related to the lepton nucleon ( @xmath29 ) and photon nucleon asymmetries ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) by @xmath32 in a separate measurement using transversly polarised targets the transverse asymmetry @xmath33 was measured .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are known kinematic factors .",
    "@xmath37 was found to be small in the kinematic range of the smc data @xcite and thus the second term in eq .",
    "[ emk - raw ] can be neglected .",
    "inclusive asymmetries are determined using two methods . in the first one ,",
    "called standard method , only scattered muons are used , in the second one , any hadron in addition to the scattered muon signals a true deep inelastic scattering and provides a discrimination between these events and background events like radiative events or elastic electron muon scattering @xcite .",
    "thus , the effective dilution factor @xmath38 is much larger for the hadron method than for the standard one ( see fig .  [",
    "emk - dilfac]a ) .    in the smc spectrometer mainly forward produced",
    "charged hadrons with momenta @xmath39  gev were detected .",
    "events with a high mass @xmath40 of the final state contain in general several hadrons with high momenta .",
    "high @xmath40 events are typically found at small @xmath10 , so that a good acceptance for deep inelastic events is obtained for @xmath41 , whereas in the high @xmath10 region many hadrons are not detected due to the low momenta at low @xmath40 .",
    "in addition cuts are applied to reject electrons from conversion of bremstrahlung photons .",
    "monte carlo studies show that more than 80% of the deep inelastic events are found by requiring at least one additional hadron to the scattered muon .",
    "the results for @xmath42 from both methods are compared in fig .",
    "[ emk - dilfac]b for @xmath0 and @xmath1  gev@xmath2 .",
    "good agreement is obtained between the two results with the statistical erros bars smaller for @xmath41 for the hadron method .",
    "the optimal smc data set for @xmath42 and @xmath43 is shown in fig .",
    "[ emk - a1 ] in comparison to measurements from the emc @xcite at a similar @xmath9 and the lower @xmath9  data from e143 @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainties are shown as bands at the bottom . at low @xmath10 , the main contributions are due to the uncertainty of radiative corrections , the neglect of @xmath31 and acceptance variations . at high",
    "@xmath10 they stem from uncertainties of @xmath44 and the beam and target polarisation .",
    "in addition to the @xmath10 dependence also the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath30 was investigated .",
    "no @xmath9 dependence is observed in the kinematic range of the smc data .",
    "an extension of the measured asymmetries down to @xmath45 with @xmath46  gev@xmath2 is under study . in this kinematic region",
    "the inclusive events are dominated by muon scattering off atomic electrons . in 1995/6 data",
    "were collected using a dedicated `` low @xmath10 '' trigger in which both a minimal energy deposit in the hadronic part of the calorimeter and the detection of a muon was demanded @xcite .",
    "[ emk - lowx]a shows the kinematic acceptance of this trigger compared to other experiments , while the preliminary results for @xmath42 are shown in fig .",
    "[ emk - lowx]b .",
    "the two smc data sets are compatible in the overlap region . at low @xmath10",
    "no significant spin effects are visible .    for @xmath47  gev@xmath2 the spin structure functions , @xmath3 , are calculated from the measured asymmetries with eq .  [ emk - apar ] using @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are taken from unpolarised measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ emk - g1 ] ) .",
    "to determine the first moment , @xmath51 , the results for @xmath52 at a fixed @xmath53 are needed .",
    "though the precision of the available data and the @xmath9 range do not allow a direct measurement of a possible @xmath9 dependence of @xmath54 different @xmath9 behaviours of @xmath3 and @xmath6 are expected from perturbative qcd .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath3 is estimated from a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd analysis @xcite of all available proton , neutron and deuteron data with @xmath55  gev@xmath2 . in this analysis @xmath3",
    "is decomposed into polarised quark singlet @xmath56 , gluon @xmath57 and nonsinglet distributions @xmath58 for the proton and the neutron .",
    "the nlo analysis is done in the adler - bardeen and the @xmath59 scheme @xcite . in the fit",
    "some parameters like the normalisation of the nonsinglet distributions were constrained by using the neutron and hyperon @xmath60 decay constants assuming su(3 ) flavour .",
    "the results for the polarised parton distributions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are shown in fig .",
    "[ emk - pdf ] .    in the qpm",
    "the quark contribution to the nucleon spin is given by the singlet axial charge @xmath64 whereas it is ambiguous in nlo pqcd due to the axial anomaly .",
    "thus , the first moment of @xmath56 , @xmath65 is equal to @xmath66 in the @xmath59 scheme , while in the ab scheme the gluon contribution must be subtracted .",
    "the results @xmath67 and @xmath68 are similar in both schemes and correspond to about 1/3 of the naive ellis - jaffe expectation of 0.58 .",
    "the result for the gluon contribution @xmath69 @xmath70 shows that very little can be said about this quantity on the basis of the present data .",
    "using the results of the qcd analysis @xmath71  gev@xmath72 is obtained from @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath3 to @xmath74 and @xmath75 is done by integrating the fit results for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "[ emk - sr]a ) .",
    "the results at @xmath78  gev@xmath79 @xmath80 show a violation of the elle - jaffe sum rules of about 3 @xmath81 .    to test the bjorken sum rule",
    "the fit has to be repeated releasing the constraints for the nonsinglet moments using @xmath82 as a free parameter .",
    "a consistent value of @xmath83 with the nominal value used above is obtained . the resulting value for the bjorken sum rule at @xmath84  gev@xmath2 @xmath85 is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of @xmath86 . an alternative way to determine @xmath87 restricts the qcd analysis to the nonsinglet distribution which is decoupled from the evolution of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here , data points for @xmath88 and @xmath89 at the same kinematics are needed so that only the slac e143 and smc can be used presently ( see fig .",
    "[ emk - sr]b ) ) .",
    "the result @xmath90 is constistent with the above result , but due to the smaller data set the experimental errors are larger . the theoretical error ,",
    "however , is smaller than for the first method , so that with the forthcoming data from e155 and hermes a significant improvement is expected .",
