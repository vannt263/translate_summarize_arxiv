    "the accretion processes have a lot of similarities in spite of the differences in the type and the mass of the accreting object . in the last years",
    "a few microquasar sources have been discovered .",
    "they are galactic x - ray binaries in which a black hole ( bh ) or neutron star is accreting from the companion star , producing jets and even superluminal motion ( mirabel & rodriguez , 1999 ) .",
    "the accreting stellar mass compact objects give us a tool to investigate phenomena in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at much lower energy and much shorter time scale .",
    "the aim of this letter is to show striking similarities between the emission lines of two accreting white dwarfs and the emission lines coming from the broad line region of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , in spite of the mass difference ( a typical bh in agn has a mass @xmath010@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4  and the white dwarf in the interacting binaries @xmath01@xmath4 ) .",
    "a comparison between such different objects can give us a better understanding of the accretion / ejection phenomenology , as well as of the so called ",
    "eigenvector  1 correlations \" that seem to be fundamental for agn interpretation .",
    "we think it is appropriate to call these two accreting white dwarfs of this paper  nano - quasars \" because they seem to represent the very low energy analog of quasars and microquasars .",
    "ch  cyg and mwc  560 are interacting binary stars in which a white dwarf accretes matter from the wind of a red giant .",
    "their spectra and the spectrum of i  zw  1 are plotted in fig.[spec ] .",
    "i  zw  1 is a  narrow - line \" seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) nucleus , well known because of his strong  emission and relatively narrow lines ( fwhm@xmath01000  km@xmath5s@xmath6 ) , widely used as template for subtraction of the feii complex in the h@xmath7 -   region of quasar spectra . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ spec ] we show the spectral region @xmath84200@xmath84900  , and in the middle panel the uv region .",
    "the optical spectrum of i  zw  1 was obtained at the 1.52 m eso telescope at la silla , and the uv was retrieved from the hubble ( hst ) archive .",
    "the optical spectrum of mwc  560 is the average of the feros public archive spectra observed in the period november - december 1998 at eso ( kaufer et 1999 , schmid 2001 ) .",
    "both optical and uv spectra of ch  cyg were obtained in 1984 , when the star underwent jet activity .",
    "the optical spectrum of ch cyg is from the plate archive of the bulgarian national astronomical observatory  rozhen \" ( observed on 10 july 1984 ) .",
    "the uv spectrum have been retrieved from the international ultraviolet explorer database ( observed on 23 jan 1985 ) .",
    "a clear similarity between the emission lines can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "practically almost every emission line visible in the spectrum of i  zw  1 has corresponding features in the spectra of ch  cyg and mwc  560 .",
    "an obvious similarity is visible also between the uv spectrum of ch  cyg and the one of i zw 1 .",
    "we note in passing that similar emission lines are also visible in the spectrum of xx oph ( kolev & tomov 1993 ) , where the accreting object is probably a main sequence star ( evans et al . 1993 ) . despite the general similarity some differences are visible as well . in mwc 560",
    "these are the absorption components in the balmer lines .",
    "these absorptions are due to the jet coinciding with the line of sight ( tomov et al .",
    "they are also dominating the uv spectrum of mwc  560 ( not shown here ) making it quite different from the ones of ch  cyg and i  zw  1 . in the optical spectrum of ch",
    "cyg numerous absorptions due to the photosphere around the white dwarf are visible .    in fig.[spec ]",
    "( lower panel ) the optical emission line spectra of mwc  560 and ch  cyg are shown after having been continuum subtracted , scaled and broadened .",
    "this standard procedure is widely used for the emission line measurements of agn , using i  zw  1 itself as a template . after this processing , good identity",
    "is achieved with the spectrum of i  zw  1 .",
    "our best fit corresponds to a width fwhm(feii@xmath9)@xmath10970@xmath1190  km@xmath5s@xmath6 .",
    "the hydrogen emission lines as well as the feii emissions of agn are emitted from the so - called broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "this region is thought to be within @xmath121  pc from the central bh .",
    "its structure is poorly understood as yet .",
    "the clear similarity between the emission lines means that , in objects like mwc  560 and ch  cyg , we are observing a scaled down version of the quasar blr .",
    "it worth noting that the interacting binaries , in which a white dwarf accretes material from the wind of a red giant ( usually classified as symbiotic stars ) are strongly variable objects .",
    "for ch  cyg and mwc  560 we show that their spectra are similar to low - redshift quasars in moments when jet activity has been detected ( see  [ jets ] ) .",
    "during the last decade , several investigations of agn emission lines emphasized the importance of a set of correlations conventionally called  eigenvector-1 \" ( hereafter e1 ) and related to principal component analysis of the properties of pg quasars boroson & green ( 1992 ) . in the most important diagram associated to e1 ( sulentic 2000 ) , the x - axis is the ratio between the equivalent width of the feii complex in the range 44344684   and the equivalent width of the h@xmath13  broad component ( ) , namely r@xmath14 w(feii)/w(h@xmath15 ) .",

    "the diagram of fig.2 is believed to play for agn role similar to the one of hertzsprung - russell diagram for stars ( sulentic 2001 ) .",
    "the physical drivers can be l / m ratio convolved with orientation ( marziani et al .",

    "the reverberation mapping studies of the agn ( kaspi et al 2001 ) give the following dependence of fwhm ( ) on mass and l / m : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the luminosity - to - mass ratio in solar units , with the solar value ( l / m)@xmath22=1.92  ergs  s@xmath6g@xmath6 .",

    "this points out that the number of ionizing photons and the shape of the uv and x - ray continuum are important in the e1 correlations .",
