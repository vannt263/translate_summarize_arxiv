    "<S> we investigate the fluctuations of two two - time quantities , called @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the averages of which yield the self linear response and correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a restricted average of the @xmath0 s , summing over all configurations with a given value of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the restricted average @xmath2 obeys a scaling form , and that the slope of the scaling function approaches the universal value @xmath3 of the limiting effective temperature in the long - time limit and for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our results tend to confirm the expectation that time - reparametrization invariance is not realized in coarsening systems at criticality . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss possible experimental tests of our proposal .    </S>",
