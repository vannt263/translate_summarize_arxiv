    "it is said that a cyclic code is irreducible if its parity - check polynomial is irreducible . over a number of years",
    ", several authors have dedicated their efforts to solving the problem of determining the weight distribution of families of irreducible cyclic codes ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , and this has been so because the weight distribution determines the capabilities of error detection and correction of a given code . on the other hand ,",
    "the family of cyclic codes is important because it possesses a rich algebraic structure that can be utilized in a variety of ways , particularly , in the design of very efficient coding and decoding algorithms .",
    "there are instances where the problem of determining the weight distribution of an irreducible cyclic code is quite simple .",
    "for example , it is not difficult to see that any irreducible cyclic code over @xmath0 , of length @xmath1 and dimension one , is equivalent to a repetition code of length @xmath1 , and therefore its weight enumerator polynomial is always of the form : @xmath2 .",
    "however , as was pointed out in @xcite the problem of determining the weight distributions of an irreducible cyclic code is , in general , notoriously difficult .",
    "the purpose of this note is to employ the characterization of all one - weight irreducible cyclic codes and the characterization of all semiprimitive two - weight irreducible cyclic codes , presented , respectively , in @xcite and @xcite , in order to show that any irreducible cyclic code of dimension two is either a one - weight irreducible cyclic code or a semiprimitive two - weight irreducible cyclic code .",
    "since the weight distributions of these two types of irreducible cyclic codes are already known , we can then determine the full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code over any finite field of dimension one or two .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown below , the relevance of our results in this note , is that by means of them we can actually directly determine the full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code , of dimension one or two , just by knowing its length .",
    "this note is organized as follows : in section [ secdos ] we recall the characterization of all one - weight irreducible cyclic codes and the characterization of all semiprimitive two - weight irreducible cyclic codes . in section [ sectres ]",
    "we use these characterizations in order to determine the full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code over any finite field of dimension one or two .",
    "finally , section [ conclusiones ] will be devoted to presenting our conclusions .",
    "throughout this note , we are going to use the following :    * notation . * by using @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we will denote five positive integers such that @xmath3 is a prime number , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , from now on @xmath10 will denote a fixed primitive element of @xmath11 , and for any integer @xmath12 , the polynomial @xmath13 $ ] will denote the _ minimal polynomial _ of @xmath14 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , for integers @xmath15 and @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 , @xmath18 will denote the _ multiplicative order _ of @xmath16 modulo @xmath15 .",
    "an important type of irreducible cyclic codes are the so - called one - weight irreducible cyclic codes , also known as subfield codes .",
    "the following result ( see @xcite , and alternatively , @xcite ) is a characterization of this type of irreducible cyclic codes .    [ teouno ] with our current notation , let @xmath12 be any integer",
    ". also let @xmath19 and @xmath1 be integers in such a way that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "assume that @xmath22 .",
    "then , @xmath23 is the parity - check polynomial of an @xmath24 $ ] one - weight irreducible cyclic code over @xmath0 , whose nonzero weight is @xmath25 , if and only if @xmath26 .",
    "another important type of irreducible cyclic codes are the so - called two - weight irreducible cyclic codes .",
    "this type of irreducible cyclic codes were characterized in @xcite , and , as an indirect result , the authors also showed that it is possible to characterize all semiprimitive two - weight irreducible cyclic codes over any finite field .",
    "given the importance of such indirect result , the characterization of all semiprimitive two - weight irreducible cyclic codes was formally presented in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 7 ) . as will be clear later ,",
    "this characterization is of main importance for this note , and therefore we are going to recall such result by means of the following :    table i + _ weight distribution of a semiprimitive two - weight code @xmath27 .",
    "+ _ here @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath20 .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now observe that if the length @xmath1 in the previous theorem is known , instead of the integer @xmath12 , then @xmath30 .",
    "thus , with this in mind , we can now determine the full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code , of dimension one or two , just by knowing its length @xmath1 .",
    "we formally state this result by means of the following :    [ coruno ] with our current notation , let @xmath1 be a divisor of @xmath31 , and @xmath30 . if @xmath27 is an irreducible cyclic code over @xmath0 , of length @xmath1 , then its full weight distribution is determined by means of the conditional statements in theorem [ teotres ] .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 and , thanks to the previous corollary , the weight enumerator polynomial of an irreducible cyclic code over @xmath35 , of length @xmath36 is : @xmath37 .",
    "in this note , we showed that an irreducible cyclic code of dimension one or two is either a one - weight irreducible cyclic code , of dimension one or two , or a semiprimitive two - weight irreducible cyclic code .",
    "since the weight distributions of this two types of irreducible cyclic codes are already known , we were able to determine the full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code over any finite field of dimension one or two .",
    "what we consider as an interesting result for this note , is that by corollary [ coruno ] it is now possible to directly determine the full weight distribution of any irreducible cyclic code of dimension one or two , just by knowing its length ."
