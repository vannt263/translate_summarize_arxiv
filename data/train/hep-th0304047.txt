    "the wave function renormalization constant @xmath0 satisfies the unitarity bound @xmath1 , because it is interpreted as the probability of finding a bare particle in the physical one - particle state @xcite . in perturbation theory , this bound implies the positivity of the coefficient @xmath2 in the one - loop contribution to the wave function renormalization constant , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the coupling constant , the ultraviolet cut - off and the renormalization mass scale , respectively .",
    "this inequality for @xmath0 implies the positivity of the anomalous dimension in the one - loop approximation : @xmath6 the basic assumption of the unitarity bound is the positivity of the hilbert space . however , often this assumption does not hold in the covariant quantization of gauge theories , where the time component of the gauge field has a negative signature relative to the transverse components .",
    "the anomalous dimension of the electron in the one - loop approximation , for example , @xmath7 may be negative , depending on the choice of the gauge parameter @xmath8 .",
    "although the total hilbert space has an indefinite metric in gauge theories , the physical hilbert space has a positive semidefinite norm and has a consistent probability interpretation @xcite .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of the physical operators , of course , satisfy positivity and are gauge independent .",
    "we sometimes encounter negative anomalous dimensions in nonlinear sigma models ( nl@xmath9ms ) , which are renormalizable in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath10 invariant nl@xmath9 m , defined on the sphere @xmath11 , is described by the lagrangian @xmath12 and has the negative anomalous dimension @xmath13 there are neither higher - order derivative terms , which often introduce a ghost with indefinite metric , nor gauge fields in this model .",
    "what is wrong in the proof of the unitarity bound of the wave function renormalization constant ? this is the question we study in this report .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ review ] , we briefly review the unitarity bound of the wave function renormalization constant . in ",
    "[ nlsm ] , we discuss the wave function renormalization constant in nl@xmath9 m in two dimensions . in  [ coordinate ] , we describe the coordinate dependence of the anomalous dimension . in ",
    "[ summary ] , we summarize our results .",
    "here we give a brief derivation of the unitarity bound of the wave function renormalization constant . in the klln - lehmann representation @xcite , the commutation relation of the heisenberg operators @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "is expressed as a superposition of the jordan - pauli function @xmath16 for a particle with mass @xmath17 : @xmath18 \\ket{0 } = \\int_0^\\infty \\rho(m^2 ) i\\delta ( x - y;m^2 ) d m^2 .",
    "\\label{kallen - lehmann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the spectral function @xmath19 depends only on the invariant mass squared , @xmath20 , of the complete set of states @xmath21 and has support for non - negative @xmath22 .",
    "the positivity of the metric of the hilbert space implies the positivity of the spectral function : @xmath23 the jordan - pauli invariant function @xmath24 is normalized according to @xmath25 now , the canonical commutation relations for the unrenormalized heisenberg operators , @xmath26=0,\\qquad   [ \\phi(t , x^1),\\dot{\\phi}(t , y^1)]=i\\delta(x^1-y^1 ) , \\label{ccr}\\ ] ] imply a sumrule for the spectral function .",
    "in fact , differentiating ( [ kallen - lehmann ] ) with respect to @xmath27 and taking the equal - time limit , we obtain @xmath28    the spectral function @xmath29 consists of an isolated delta function contribution from the one - particle state and a continuous spectrum contribution from scattering states of multiple particles : @xmath30 here , the wave function renormalization constant @xmath0 represents the probability of finding a bare particle in the dressed particle state , while @xmath31 represents the continuous spectrum of multiple particles . the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) for @xmath29 reads @xmath32",
    "since the positivity ( [ positivity ] ) of @xmath29 implies the positivity of both @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we find @xmath35 the desired unitarity bound for the renormalization constant follows from this inequality and the positivity of @xmath0 : @xmath36 from this unitarity bound , we usually conclude that the anomalous dimension of a field @xmath37 is positive in the one - loop approximation , as shown in the introduction .",
    "let us mow discuss the unitarity bound for the wave function renormalization constant in nl@xmath9ms described by the lagrangian @xmath38 here , we assume that the metric of the target space is positive definite to avoid the appearance of negative norm states . furthermore , we do not incorporate higher - order derivative terms in our lagrangian , since higher derivative terms inevitably introduce negative norm states . in the example discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the target space is the coset space @xmath39 , parameterized by @xmath40 , and the metric of the target space is given by @xmath41 in general , a nl@xmath9 m is defined on a coset space @xmath42 .",
    "it describes the interaction of massless nambu - goldstone bosons that appears when the symmetry group @xmath43 breaks down to its subgroup @xmath44 . while the global symmetry @xmath43 is realized nonlinearly , its subgroup @xmath45 is realized linearly .",
    "we further assume that the fields @xmath40 belong to some irreducible representation of the subgroup @xmath45 .    with these assumptions",

    "if this were not the case , we would have several independent spectral functions for various representations .",
    "the essential ingredient for the unitarity bound of the wave function renormalization constant is the positivity of the hilbert space , as well as the canonical commutation relation ( [ ccr ] ) . in nl@xmath9ms ,",
    "the derivative interaction term changes the definition of the canonical momentum , so that the equal - time commutation relation ( [ ccr ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "the canonical commutation relation in this case reads @xmath49=i\\delta^i_j\\delta(x^1-y^1),\\label{ccr2}\\ ] ] or @xmath50=ig^{ij}\\delta(x^1-y^1),\\label{ccr3}\\ ] ] where we have used the identity @xmath51 taking the vacuum expectation value of ( [ ccr3 ] ) , we find @xmath52\\ket{0 } = i\\bra{0}g^{ij}\\ket{0}\\delta(x^1-y^1).\\label{vevccr}\\ ] ] because of the @xmath45-invariance of the vacuum , the right - hand side of this relation must be proportional to @xmath47 , and thus we have @xmath53 for some quantity @xmath54 . in the example of @xmath11 , defined by eq.([metric ] )",
    ", @xmath54 is given by @xmath55    differentiating ( [ kallen - lehmann2 ] ) with respect to @xmath27 and taking the equal - time limit , we obtain @xmath52\\ket{0 } = i\\delta^{ij}\\delta(x^1-y^1)\\int\\rho(m^2)dm^2.\\label{vevccr2}\\ ] ] comparing this result with eqs.([vevccr ] ) and ( [ vevmetric ] ) , we find the sum - rule of the spectral function , @xmath56 the expression ( [ sepation ] ) of the spectral function as a sum of contributions from a single - particle and multi - particle states leads to @xmath57    we find from ( [ sumrule_nlsm ] ) that when there are no derivative interactions , @xmath58 implies the unitarity bound @xmath59 . in nl@xmath9ms , however , _ the wave function renormalization constant @xmath0 can be greater than @xmath60 _ , since @xmath54 may be positive , as shown in the example ( [ snb ] ) .",
    "therefore , more generally , we have @xmath61 the quantity @xmath54 comes from the matrix elements of local operators , and thus it represents the contributions of bubble diagrams , while @xmath31 gives the positive contributions of multi - particle states .    as an example , the lowest order contributions to @xmath54 and @xmath62 are shown in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . in the one - loop approximation , only @xmath54 in ( [ snb ] ) receives a nonvanishing contribution , @xmath63 from the bubble diagram in fig.[fig1 ] , while @xmath62 vanishes in this approximation .",
    "this value of @xmath54 and eqs.([eqn : pos_anodim ] ) and ( [ sumrule_nlsm ] ) reproduce the negative one - loop anomalous dimension ( [ eqn : on1gamma ] ) given in the introduction .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the origin of the bound ( [ ub ] ) is the invalid normalization ( [ vevccr2 ] ) of field variables .",
    "in fact , if we define a rescaled field @xmath64 by @xmath65 @xmath66 satisfies the equal - time commutation relation @xmath67\\ket{0 } = i\\delta^{ij}\\delta(x^1-y^1).\\label{newccr}\\ ] ] the spectral function @xmath68 for the rescaled field @xmath69 satisfies the normal sumrule ( [ sumrule ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have the usual unitarity bound , @xmath70 for the rescaled wave function renormalization constant @xmath71 , defined by @xmath72 the rescaling ( [ rescaling ] ) has to be carried out order by order in perturbation theory , because @xmath54 depends on the coupling constant .",
    "the total renormalization constant @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath71 , @xmath73 and satisfies the bound ( [ ub ] ) .",
    "the nl@xmath9 m is a field theory in which field variables take values on a curved manifold , like @xmath11 . to describe the curved manifold",
    ", we have the freedom of choosing any coordinates we wish .",
    "in fact we used a stereographic projection to express @xmath11 in the coordinates of @xmath74-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "instead , we could use other parameterizations , and in this section , we use the simplest coordinates ( @xmath75 ) to express @xmath11 , defined by @xmath76 if we express @xmath77 in terms of the other variables , @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 and the line element is given by @xmath80 where the metric in these coordinates reads @xmath81 because the inverse of this metric is @xmath82 the one - loop contribution to @xmath54 defined by ( [ vevmetric ] ) is negative : @xmath83 this gives a positive anomalous dimension , @xmath84 in contrast to the negative anomalous dimension given in ( [ eqn : on1gamma ] ) .",
    "the sign of the anomalous dimension of the nl@xmath9 m depends on the parameterization of the manifold .",
    "how should we understand this fact ?",
    "the anomalous dimension is an off - shell quantity describing the asymptotic behavior of the propagator in the ultraviolet region .",
    "various parameterizations of a manifold give different metrics defining different field theories .",
    "there must be common quantities in these theories , since they all describe the same target manifold .",
    "in fact , under the coordinate transformation from @xmath48 with the metric ( [ metric ] ) to @xmath85 with the metric ( [ metric2 ] ) , @xmath86 physical quantities defined on the mass - shell are invariant .",
    "this is a special case of the theorem due to kamefuchi , oraifeartaigh and salam@xcite , which states that s - matrix elements are invariant under transformations of the type @xmath87 s - matrix elements are defined as pole residues of green s functions .",
    "only the linear term in the transformation ( [ kostr ] ) contributes to the pole residues .",
    "quadratic and higher - order terms do not contribute to poles unless there are bound states .",
    "therefore , all s - matrix elements , that is , all physical quantities , are invariant under the transformation ( [ kostr ] ) .    in a previous work @xcite , we derived the wilsonian renormalization group equation in two - dimensional nl@xmath9ms with @xmath88 supersymmetry .",
    "we used the so - called khler normal coordinate @xcite to derive the anomalous dimensions .",
    "because the anomalous dimensions depend on the choice of the coordinate , we should interpret the results obtained in ref@xcite as the anomalous dimensions in the khler normal coordinate system .",
    "the wave function renormalization constant @xmath0 represents the probability of finding the bare particle in the physical particle , in the case that there are no derivative interactions .",
    "it satisfies the unitarity bound @xmath1 in field theories without indefinite metric states .",
    "this unitarity bound implies the positivity of the anomalous dimension of the field in the one - loop approximation .    in nl@xmath9ms ,",
    "however , this bound does not hold , due to the presence of the derivative interactions .",
    "the field dependence of the canonical momentum modifies the canonical commutation relation to @xmath52\\ket{0 } = i\\delta^{ij}\\delta(x^1-y^1)(1+b).\\label{modccr}\\ ] ] in this case , the actual unitarity bound of the wave function renormalization constant is @xmath89 the contribution of the bubble diagrams to the self - energy diagrams , @xmath54 , can be either positive or negative , while the contributions from multi - particle states , @xmath62 , satisfies positivity , as expected .",
    "when @xmath54 is positive , the anomalous dimension in the one - loop approximation becomes negative .",
    "the sign of the contribution from the bubble diagrams , @xmath54 , depends on the choice of the coordinates parameterizing the target manifold .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the properly normalized field @xmath64 by ( [ rescaling ] ) .",
    "the renormalization constant @xmath71 of the field @xmath64 satisfies the usual unitarity bound ( [ rescaledbound ] ) and has a probabilistic interpretation .",
