    "be a sequence of positive real numbers that converges to zero .",
    "is it true that @xmath16    the following example of falconer  @xcite shows that question  [ q : limit ] has a negative answer in dimension one : we consider the set @xmath17 set  @xmath2 has density  @xmath18 and avoids all odd distances .",
    "the scaled set  @xmath19 also has density  @xmath18 , and in particular it avoids distances  @xmath20 , @xmath21 ,  ,  @xmath22 .",

    "one answer was given by bukh  @xcite based on a version of szemerdi s regularity lemma for measurable functions ( see also chapter  2.4 in tao  @xcite ) .",

    "observe that  @xmath39 and that  @xmath35 is the set of all lines passing through the origin of  @xmath3 ; the spaces  @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and  @xmath40 are defined similarly .",

    "it turns out that , as in the case of the euclidean space , one is able to show exponential decay when the real dimension of the space considered is at least  @xmath45 , and when the real dimension is  @xmath20 it is possible to show that the answer to the analogue of question  [ q : limit ] is negative .    to make ideas precise , we start by considering a generalization of steinhaus theorem to locally compact groups due to weil ( cf .",

    ", this theorem implies that subsets of a homogeneous space avoiding a set of distances with infimum zero need to have measure zero .",
    "more precisely , let  @xmath48 be a riemannian manifold with isometry group  @xmath46 acting transitively on  @xmath48 , i.e. ,  @xmath48 is a homogeneous @xmath46-space whose measure is induced by the haar measure of  @xmath46 .",
    "let  @xmath5 be a set of positive real numbers having infimum zero .",

    ",  @xmath27 are given so that  @xmath52 , then  @xmath53 .    in the statement of the theorem",
    "we are purposely vague : the essence of the statement is that , as long as the distances  @xmath0 ,  ,  @xmath27 are sufficiently spaced out , then the maximum density is exponentially small . in section",
    "[ sec : dimensiontwo ] we will give a precise statement of theorem  [ thm : main - vague ] in which we specify how the distances should space out in order for the conclusion of the theorem to hold .",
    "notice that this theorem implies that , if  @xmath0 , @xmath1 ,   is a sequence of distances converging to zero and the real dimension of the space is at least  @xmath45 , then @xmath54 thus giving a positive answer to the analogue of question  [ q : limit ] for the space  @xmath48 .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : dimensionone ] that if the real dimension of  @xmath48 is  @xmath20 , then there are zero - converging sequences  @xmath0 , @xmath1 ,  of distances for which the limit in   is nonzero , thus showing that question  [ q : limit ] has a negative answer in dimension  @xmath20 .",
    "so the big picture is similar to the one of  @xmath3 discussed earlier , and also the example that shows lack of decay in dimension one is similar to the one we gave before for the real line .",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm : main - vague ] in section  [ sec : dimensiontwo ] .",
    "for the proof of this theorem we will use the generalization of the lovsz theta number for distance graphs defined over compact metric spaces given by bachoc , nebe , oliveira , and vallentin  @xcite . this generalization will provide upper bounds for  @xmath55 by means of the solution of an infinite - dimensional semidefinite programming problem , which reduces to an infinite - dimensional linear programming problem when the riemannian manifold  @xmath48 is a symmetric space .",
    "we recall the necessary background for this approach in section  [ sec : theta ] .",
    "there are only two compact , connected , rank - one symmetric spaces  @xmath48 of real dimension one : the unit circle  @xmath56 and the real projective line  @xmath57 . for each of these two spaces",
    "we show that there is a zero - convergent sequence of distances  @xmath0 , @xmath1 ,   and measurable subsets  @xmath58 , @xmath59 ,    of  @xmath48 all having measure at least  @xmath60 for some positive constant  @xmath60 , such that  @xmath61 avoids distances  @xmath0 ,  ,",
    "this implies a negative answer to the analogue of question  [ q : limit ] for the space  @xmath48 .",
    "we aim at presenting a single construction that works for both the unit circle and the real projective line . to this end , for  @xmath63 , @xmath45 ,  , write  @xmath64 and  @xmath65 .",

    "so we can see  @xmath73 as a subset of  @xmath48 .",
