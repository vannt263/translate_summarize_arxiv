    "in spite of numerous efforts to define quantum chaos , there seems to exist many counter examples of genuine chaos in quantum systems . among those the quasi - periodic time evolution of isolated bound systems and the limited diffusion due to the momentum localization in the periodically kicked quantum rotator",
    "are typical examples @xcite .",
    "although they are rather persuasive to give up searching quantum chaos , we still reserve a good reason to believe the seeds of chaos should exist in quantum system which grow to classical chaos .",
    "one way to observe it is in the time evolution of the wigner function ; @xmath4.\\ ] ] when the quantum liouville operator @xmath5 is expanded in terms of the planck constant as @xmath6 the lowest order term generates the classical evolution , @xmath7 = \\sum_{i } \\{h , f\\}^{(i)},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 represents the poisson bracket with respect to the @xmath9-th canonical variables ( @xmath10 ) of a system with the hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to search the origin of chaos in the region of @xmath12 , @xmath13 the semi - classical limit .",
    "in fact , recent intensive investigations @xcite have revealed rich structures in this limit .",
    "there is another way to observe the emergence of chaos .",
    "if it exists in the system which involves many degrees of freedom . since the most characteristic property of a macroscopic system is the large number of degrees of freedom involved in describing the motion , it is natural to consider a system with infinite number of degrees of freedom as the realistic classical limit",
    "in this case we expect that quantum mechanical phases of each degree of freedom interfere mutually , and are wiped out in chaotic environment resulting the classical behavior of the wigner function , _ i.e. _ the classical distribution function @xcite .",
    "when the number of degrees of freedom @xmath0 involved in a system tends to infinity , the mean - field approximation often becomes exact due to the large number theorem .",
    "in such a case the wigner function can be approximated in a product form@xcite , @xmath14 of functions corresponding to the @xmath0 sub - systems .",
    "the wigner function for the @xmath9-th sub - system then evolves as @xmath15,\\ ] ] with the appropriately defined mean - field operator , @xmath16 . in general , this operator depends on the temporal distributions of surrounding sub - systems .",
    "thus the mean - field liouville equation ( [ eq : liouville_eq ] ) becomes non - linear and time - dependent .",
    "it is our expectation that the non - linearity and the time - dependence induce chaos , and chaos destroys quantum phases . in the next section",
    "we shall describe time evolution of the wigner function for a system of coupled kicked rotators , and the mean - field approximation is introduced . in the third section the mean - field equation",
    "is replaced by an equivalent system of a quantum kicked rotator coupled with a classical kicked rotator representing the environment . and",
    "numerical simulation of this system is examined .",
    "the idea of spontaneous decoherence is discussed based on the numerical calculation in the last section .",
    "let us examine the scenario more explicitly by taking the coupled @xmath0-kicked rotator model @xcite as an example .",
    "the hamiltonian is assumed to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the periodical kick . in this",
    "model couplings of @xmath0 kicked rotators enter through off - diagonal kinetic terms .",
    "couplings through the kick term @xcite may be converted to this form through a linear transformation of angle variables .",
    "the classical equation of motion is known as the _ standard map _ which is the mapping between canonical coordinates just after kicks at times @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 we shall choose the magnitudes of matrix elements of the kinetic term as @xmath22 where the exponent @xmath23 will be determined later so that the system is non - trivial and converging in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "evolution of the wigner function is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "the relation between wigner functions just after kicks at times @xmath19 and @xmath20 is called the quantum mapping , and it can be written as @xmath24 with the mapping operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 here , the operator @xmath29 appeared in @xmath25 , @xmath30 is a difference operator , and quantum effects in the evolution equation enter only through this operator .",
    "since it approaches to the differential operator in the classical limit as @xmath31   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}f(p ) , ( \\hbar \\rightarrow 0 ) \\label{eq : diff_op}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantum mapping reduces to the well - known standard map of classical distribution function , @xmath32 in the @xmath33 limit .",
    "although the difference between classical and quantum evolutions looks very small from eqs.([eq : up_ope ] ) and([eq : diff_op ] ) at a glance , the consequence of actions of the operator @xmath25 on the exponential function may be instructive . in quantum mechanical case it acts as @xmath34 with @xmath35 while in the classical limit it reduces to the standard shift operator along the momentum axis , @xmath36 _ i.e. _ the operator @xmath29 behaves as the usual shift operator only for small wave number components . for large wave numbers shifts",
    "are suppressed by the factor @xmath37 and direction of the shift alternates .",
    "this implies that rapid variations of the wigner function along the p - axis are suppressed , and consequently chaotic folding of the distribution function terminates at fine scale of the order @xmath38 .",
    "now , let us consider the large @xmath0 limit where we expect that the mean - field approximation works well .",
    "let us suppose at a certain time @xmath19 the wigner function is written in a product form , @xmath39 integrating the evolution equation([eq : quantum_map ] ) over all phase volume except the @xmath9-th canonical coordinates , we obtain the equation for the reduced wigner function of the @xmath9-th sub - system : @xmath40 where the reduced wigner function has been defined at @xmath20 as @xmath41 which will turn out to be the solution of the equation which we may call the _ statistical _ mean - field equation evolved from @xmath42 of eq.([eq : mfwf ] ) .",
    "expanding the exponential function in the integrand of the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq : red_liouville ] ) we obtain @xmath43 f_i^{(t)}(\\theta_i , p_i),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the first and second order terms , where we have written @xmath44 writing back this expression to the exponential form we have @xmath45 for the first two terms of the cumulant expansion . here , @xmath46 is the momentum variance of the @xmath47-th sub - system , @xmath48 we have chosen that the coupling strength @xmath49 to be @xmath50 , and thus the @xmath51-th cumulant ( _ i.e. _ the term involving @xmath52 ) is of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 classifies nature of the system into the following cases in the @xmath54 limit :    * @xmath55 , any cumulant converges to @xmath56 and the system becomes a set of independent kicked rotators . *",
    "@xmath57 , only the first cumulant @xmath58 survives and the _ ordinary _ mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath59 drive the reduced wigner function @xmath60 . * @xmath61 , the ordinary mean - field theory is valid assuming @xmath58 remains finite . by transforming the system in a rotating frame with an appropriate momentum @xmath62 , the fluctuation @xmath63 can be kept finite . *",
    "@xmath64 , the statistical mean - field theory is valid providing @xmath63 kept finite . *",
    "@xmath65 , the second cumulant diverges and the system becomes unphysical . in this case it does not make any sense to consider the reduced wigner function .",
    "the statistical mean - field equation is given by @xmath66 since evolution operator of the @xmath9-th subsystem involves only the @xmath9-th canonical coordinates product form of the wigner function will remains at @xmath20 : @xmath67 the proof that the product eq.([eq : mfwf2 ] ) is indeed the solution of the evolution equation ( [ eq : quantum_map ] ) is given in ref.@xcite . for studying asymptotic behavior of the momentum distribution",
    "it is more convenient to consider the fourier transform of the reduced wigner function in the statistical mean - field approximation , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the fourier parameters corresponding to the variables @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the momentum distribution function for the @xmath9-th sub - system is then readily expressed as @xmath73 the evolution equation in this representation is written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the bessel function of the order m , and we have defined @xmath76 @xmath77 for the asymptotic behavior of @xmath78 , there will exist at least two cases depending on the nature of environment : @xmath79 when the environment is chaotic the sum over @xmath80 in eq.([eq : evolution_sub ] ) will be dominated asymptotically by the @xmath81 components .",
    "the asymptotic form of the evolution equation then becomes @xmath82 whose solution is now trivial .",
    "especially the @xmath81 components are given as @xmath83 inserting this solution into eq.([eq : mom_dist ] ) together with help of the cental limit theorem we obtain the asymptotic form of the momentum distribution function as @xmath84^{{1 \\over 2 } } e^{-{p^2 \\over t \\lambda_{i}^2 } } , \\label{eq : cmom_dist}\\ ] ] which is the same function as the classical distribution of the chaotic limit .",
    "the @xmath85 dominance suggests that when the environment become chaotic the system starts behaving classically due to the phase decoherence .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath0-coupled kicked rotator will fall into chaos in the large @xmath0 limit in cases when the statistical mean - field approximation works well . under those circumstances it becomes possible to study , instead of treating whole system at once , just by picking up any one of the rotators as an object system which we simply call the system(@xmath86 ) under influence of other rotators as the environment(@xmath87 ) .",
    "interaction between @xmath86 and @xmath87 enters as an external field with strength proportional to the state averaged momentum in our model .",
    "although the mean - field approximation makes it possible to perform the large @xmath0 calculation as many as @xmath88 by using large scale parallel processors , we leave such huge simulations as the future project .",
    "instead , we assume the mean - field strength ( [ eq : mf_strength ] ) is replaced by a classical system with appropriate initial ensemble .",
    "we choose the ensemble so that it become equivalent to the statistical mean - field theory .",
    "now , let us consider a quantum kicked rotator(@xmath86 ) with the hamiltonian , @xmath89 under the influence of classical environment(@xmath87 ) through @xmath90 .",
    "this system evolves as @xmath91 or by the fourier transform it reads @xmath92 after taking average over the initial ensemble the evolution equation is written as @xmath93 = \\sum_{m ' } j_{m - m ' } ( \\frac{2 \\lambda_s}{\\hbar } \\sin \\frac{\\hbar k}{2 } ) e[e^{-im ' g^{(t ) } } \\tilde{f}_s^{(t)}(m',k - m')],\\ ] ] where we write the ensemble averaged quantities by @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "we assume the ensemble of mean - field couplings @xmath95 to be gaussian with the correlation , @xmath96 - e[g^{(t ) } ] e[g^{(t')}]= \\delta_{tt ' } \\sigma^{(t ) } .",
    "\\label{eq : correlation}\\ ] ] in this case the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath97 vanishes , and we have @xmath98 = \\\\ \\sum_{m ' } j_{m - m ' } ( \\frac{2 \\lambda_s}{\\hbar } \\sin \\frac{\\hbar}{2 } k )   e^{-im'e[g^{(t)}]-{1 \\over 2 } m'^2 \\sigma^{(t ) } }   e[\\tilde{f}_s^{(t)}(m',k - m ' ) ] .",
    "\\label{eq : e_tilde}\\ ] ] this equation is equivalent to the statistical mean - field equation ( [ eq : evolution_sub ] ) .    our next task is to give @xmath90 explicitly in order to solve the evolution eq.([eq : qc_evolution ] ) .",
    "one of the possible choice of @xmath90 which possesses both properties eq.([eq : variant ] ) and ( [ eq : correlation ] ) is the momentum generated by the classical kicked rotator , @xmath99 with a set of initial values @xmath100 as the ensemble .",
    "iterating eq.([eq : qc_evolution ] ) together with eq.([eq : sdmap ] ) the behavior of @xmath86 will show the quantum - classical transition depending on the environment .    before examining results of the numerical calculation",
    "let us remark the consistency of the choice of @xmath90 .",
    "the momentum distribution of @xmath87 in the mean - field approximation is given by @xmath101 if each rotator is in a chaotic state its momentum distribution is known to be @xmath102 asymptotically . in this case",
    "@xmath103 also has the same form with the diffusion constant being @xmath104 which is @xmath105 for our choice of @xmath106",
    ".    we shall now examine numerical results which support the scenario described in the last section .",
    "we solve the schr \" odinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : qc_hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath90 generated from the standard map ( [ eq : sdmap ] ) . at each time step",
    "we measure the momentum fluctuation of @xmath86 , @xmath107,\\ ] ] averaged over the initial ensemble which consists typically 20 members for each set of parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 . as in the classical rotator chaos",
    "is measured by the diffusion constant defined by the rate of momentum fluctuation . in order to see the effect of chaotic environment",
    "the system is maintained in chaos by choosing @xmath110 , and varying the environment @xmath111 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the coupling strength is chosen to be @xmath112 .",
    "as we have expected the energy diffusion starts precisely when the environment become chaotic , @xmath13 @xmath113 . to make sure that the increase of kinetic energy is not due to the direct penetration of energy from @xmath87 via coupling",
    ", we made the similar calculation by keeping the system in the regular regime , @xmath114 .",
    "no energy diffusion has been observed in this case .",
    "choice of the coupling strength @xmath115 comes from the requirement that the property of @xmath86 should not be altered significantly by the environment .",
    "weakness of the coupling effect is clear if we compare diffusion constants of an isolated classical rotator which is @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "no significant difference is observed when the coupling strength is less than @xmath118 .",
    "although the effect of environment is small on the classical system , it has the essential action on the quantum system .",
    "it is seen in fig.2 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are kept in chaos ( @xmath119 ) and the coupling strength is varied . above the lower critical coupling @xmath120 the environment effect appears in the diffusion constant of @xmath86 .",
    "next , we observe the transition of @xmath86 from the regular motion to chaos under the influence of the chaotic environment with keeping @xmath121 ( fig.3 ) . at the classical critical strength @xmath122 the quantum system persists to be diffusion - less .",
    "it is only after @xmath123 the system shows diffusion .",
    "change of the evolution from quantum to classical by the effect of @xmath87 can also be seen in the momentum distribution .",
    "figs.4 ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the regular motion and the chaotic regime , respectively . in the regular case",
    "the momentum localization persists during the simulation time up to @xmath124 , while in the chaotic case the momentum distribution changes following the classical diffusion law described by eq.([eq : cmom_dist ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that a single quantum kicked rotator shows only limited energy diffusion .",
    "the limited diffusion is considered to be generic in quantized systems with a few degrees of freedom whose motion show chaos in the classical evolution .",
    "we have searched the source of classical diffusion in systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "these system can be treated in the statistical mean - field approximation , where we can pick any one of the sub - system as an object system and the rest as the environment .",
    "energy diffusion has been observed in the quantum system when the environment is in classical chaos .",
    "momentum distribution of the quantum system is also same as one which we normally observe in a classical chaotic system .",
    "since each building block of the environment is the same type of quantum system , the transition from the quantum behavior to the classical behavior seen in the diffusion should occur spontaneously .",
    "one may wonder then where is the seed of chaos in linear dynamical system like quantum mechanical system .",
    "it is certainly very difficult to point out the cause of chaos unlike classical dynamical system where the existence of homoclinic point means chaos .",
    "although we have no rigorous proof for the existence of chaos in quantum systems in the limit of infinite number of degrees of freedom , the exactness of the certain class of mean - field approximation in the large @xmath0 limit suggests that the non - linearity is secretly inherited in quantum system with infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is the non - linear mean - field equation which possesses the source of chaos within itself",
