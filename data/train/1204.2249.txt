    "ideal hydrodynamics with smooth initial density distribution has been used successfully in recent past to model the evolution of the hot and dense system produced in collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies .",
    "the experimental data  @xcite for @xmath2 spectra and elliptic flow of several hadrons at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energy are well reproduced upto a relatively large value of transverse momentum ( @xmath3 gev/@xmath1 ) using hydrodynamic models  @xcite with smooth initial conditions ( ic ) . however , for any given single event there may be randomly distributed inhomogenities in the initial energy density .",
    "lately it has been shown that event - by - event ( e - by - e ) fluctuations in the ic have sizable effect on the physical observables if they are computed by averaging over many final states rather than considering an averaged initial density profile .",
    "recent studies have reported that e - by - e fluctuating ic reproduces the experimental charged particle elliptic flow even for the most central collisions at rhic  @xcite which was underestimated by all earlier hydrodynamic calculations using smooth ic . the e - by - e hydrodynamics with fluctuations in the ic also give a better agreement of the experimental charged particle spectra at high @xmath2 by increasing the number of particles there  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the initial state fluctuations may also help to understand the various structures observed in two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "direct photons are considered as one of the few observables able to probe the initial state of the hot and dense matter produced in the collisions .",
    "thermal emission of photons from the evolving system shows a very strong temperature dependence .",
    "photons having @xmath4@xmath1 are expected to provide a glimpse of the early part of the expansion history .",
    "these photons are especially suitable for probing the fluctuations in the ic due to their sensitivity to the initial temperature of the plasma  @xcite .    thermal radiation is predicted to be the dominant source of direct photons in the range @xmath5 gev/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , photon results using smooth ic and latest rates  @xcite fall well below the experimental data points ( fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) in this @xmath2 range . in a recent work  @xcite",
    "we have shown a substantial enhancement in the production of thermal photons for @xmath6 gev/@xmath1 with an e - by - e fluctuating ic relative to a smooth initial - state averaged profile in the ideal hydrodynamic calculation for 200 agev au+au collisions at rhic and for the 020% centrality bin .",
    "consequently , our results with fluctuating density profile improve the agreement with the phenix experimental data for @xmath7 gev/@xmath1 in that centrality bin .",
    "the enhancement was found to scale with the inverse of the initial fluctuation size .    here",
    "we perform a more systematic study of the effects of the initial state fluctuations on the production of thermal photons in heavy ion collisions and propose an experimentally measurable quantity @xmath8 that can be useful to quantify the fluctuation size realized in nature .",
    "the effects of the initial density fluctuations are found to be more pronounced for lower beam energies and for smaller size systems .",
    "in addition , the initial formation time of the plasma plays a crucial role in all these calculations . as the value of @xmath9",
    "is not known unambiguously , we see that it is difficult to distinguish between the results from fluctuating ic at a particular @xmath9 and the results at a relatively smaller @xmath9 using the smooth ic .",
    "this is relevant since one can argue that the formation time of the plasma for peripheral collisions may not remain the same as for central collisions since the initial energy density and system size become smaller moving from central to peripheral collisions .",
    "the effects of the initial state fluctuations on the production of thermal photons are studied with different values of @xmath9 changing with collision centrality at the lhc energy .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath9 is taken from the ekrt model calculations  @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath9 for peripheral collisions increase the difference between the results from the smooth and the fluctuating ic slightly compared to the results with a smaller @xmath9 . from the centrality dependent results at different formation times",
    "we conclude that we need to look for a quantity besides the photon spectra as these are insufficient to quantify the fluctuations in the ic .",
    "the ratio of central to peripheral yield normalized by the number of binary collisions , @xmath10 , shows potential to probe the density fluctuations and their size in the ic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly describe the e - by - e hydrodynamic framework used in this study and the production of thermal photons from it . in the next section photon results",
    "are shown from the smooth and fluctuating ic at rhic for different collision centralities .",
    "after that we show the thermal photon @xmath2 spectra from the smooth and fluctuating ic at the lhc energy and compare those with the rhic results .",
    "photon results from the fluctuating ic considering different values of the initial formation time @xmath9 of the plasma at rhic are shown in the next section along with the results from centrality dependent @xmath9 values at lhc .",
    "next we define the ratio @xmath10 for thermal photons and calculate it as a function of collision centrality and the fluctuation size for different values of transverse momentum .",
    "finally we summarize our results .",
    "we utilize here the e - by - e hydrodynamical model developed in  @xcite , which has been applied successfully to study the hadronic spectra and elliptic flow with fluctuating ic , and to calculate the thermal photon emission at rhic  @xcite and lhc energies .",
    "the model is based on ideal hydrodynamics with the assumption of longitudinal boost invariance and the remaining ( 2 + 1)-dimensional problem is solved numerically using the shasta algorithm @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) , which shows a sharp crossover transition from the plasma phase to hadronic matter , is taken from  @xcite .",
    "the ic are obtained from the monte carlo glauber ( mcg ) model .",
    "the standard two - parameter woods - saxon nuclear density profile is used to randomly distribute the nucleons in the colliding nuclei .",
    "thus no nucleon - nucleon correlations or finite nucleon size effects are taken into account .",
    "nucleons @xmath11 and @xmath12 from two different nuclei are assumed to collide whenever they satisfy the relation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section and @xmath15 denote the positions of the nucleons in the transverse plane .",
    "the centrality classes are defined by binning the distribution of events in the number of participants ( @xmath16 ) as in ref .",
    "@xcite . table  [ table1.1 ] shows the @xmath17 ranges corresponding to the different centrality classes , the average value of impact parameter and average number of participants for each centrality class for 200 agev au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "table  [ table1.2 ] shows the same for 2.76 atev pb+pb collisions at lhc .",
    "the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section is taken as 42 ( 64 ) mb for @xmath18 0.2 ( 2.76 ) tev .",
    ".the @xmath16 range , average impact parameter @xmath19 , average numbers of participants and average numbers of binary collisions for different centrality classes of 2.76 atev pb+pb collisions at lhc according to the mc glauber model with @xmath20 64 mb . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as a function of collision centrality for thermal photons at different @xmath2 values for 2.76 atev pb+pb collisions at lhc .",
    "two different values of @xmath21 , 0.4 and 0.8 fm are used .",
    "@xmath22 ranges are taken from table [ lhctab].,width=8 ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we plot the central to peripheral ratio at lhc ( see table  [ lhctab ] for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 ranges for different centrality bins at lhc ) .",
    "we notice that the ratio @xmath10 is generally much flatter at higher collision energy .",
    "also the difference between the smooth and fluctuating initial conditions is smaller at the lhc than at rhic .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that fluctuations in the ic lead to a significant enhancement in the production of thermal photons compared to a smooth initial state averaged ic in the ideal hydrodynamic calculation . for a particular beam energy",
    "the enhancement is found to be more pronounced for peripheral collisions than for central collisions .",
    "the relative enhancement is found to be comparatively less at lhc than at rhic for the same centrality bin .",
    "the thermal photon @xmath2 results at rhic and lhc are found to be quite sensitive to the value of the initial formation time . a larger value of formation time lowers the production of thermal photons generically .",
    "one might also expect that the value of @xmath9 is not fixed and it may change with collision centralities .",
    "we have shown the @xmath2 spectra from the smooth and fluctuating ic considering different values of the initial formation time as well as results considering centrality dependent @xmath9 values from the ekrt model .",
    "the effect of fluctuations in the ic and a larger value of formation time act in opposite directions by increasing and decreasing the production respectively .",
    "all these results suggest that the effect of the ic fluctuations and change in the formation time can not be distinguished easily only by studying the spectra of thermal photons .",
    "we have shown that the central to peripheral ratio of @xmath2 spectra ( normalized with the number of binary collisions ) can be a useful measure to reduce the model - dependent uncertainties in the calculations .",
    "experimental determination of @xmath10 at different @xmath2 and at different collision centralities would be a valuable tool for estimating the size scale of the fluctuations .",
    "the difference between the @xmath10 results from the smooth and the fluctuating ic has been found stronger for peripheral collisions and for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "we also found that at the lhc energy the @xmath10 is much flatter than at rhic and the difference between fluctuating and smooth ic is smaller .",
    "however , one should bare in mind that hydrodynamics is not expected to work at very peripheral collisions ( @xmath25% ) , and that at large @xmath2 ( @xmath26 gev/@xmath1 ) the pqcd photons dominate the direct photon spectra .",
