    "a combined analysis of all these data sets , excluding the python data , is presented in ratra et al .",

    "in this paper we present a similar analysis of cmb anisotropy data from the ovro observations ( leitch et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter l00 ) .",
    "the ovro detectors and telescopes are described in leitch ( 1998 ) and l00 ; here we review information about the experiment that is needed for our analysis .",
    "ovro data were taken in two frequency bands , one centered at 14.5 ghz ( ku band ) , the other at 31.7 ghz ( ka band ) .",
    "thirty - six fields , along an approximate circle at declination @xmath7 centered on the north celestial pole ( ncp ) were observed . in our computations",
    "we use the coordinates for the 36 fields given in table 2 of l00 .",
    "the ovro measurements were made by switching the beam in a two - point pattern along the circle , resulting in a three - beam response to the sky signal .",
    "the beamthrow is @xmath8 .",
    "the zero - lag window function parameters for the ovro experiment are given in table 1 .",
    "this and other window functions are shown in fig .",
    "18 of l00 .",
    "l00 use multiepoch vla observations to detect and remove non - cmb discrete source contamination from the ovro data .",
    "we have also analyzed the ovro data ignoring 3 of the 36 fields that were affected by the strongest variable discrete source ; cosmological constraints derived from this restricted ovro cmb anisotropy data set are very consistent with those derived from the full ovro cmb anisotropy data set , so we do not discuss this restricted ovro data set analysis further .",
    "since ovro data were taken at two frequencies , it is possible to fit the data to both a non - cmb foreground component ( parametrized by the frequency dependent temperature anisotropy @xmath9 ) and a cmb anisotropy component with spectral index @xmath10 .",
    "we use the method in @xmath11 11 of l00 to extract the cmb anisotropy component in the ovro data , marginalizing over a foreground spectral index in the range @xmath12 in our likelihood analysis.@xmath13 m and 12 @xmath14 m foreground contaminant template ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) correlated components .",
    "the cosmological constraints from these analyzes are quite consistent with results presented here .",
    "this is because although the foreground signal inferred in our analysis is not entirely fit by the dust data , they are significantly correlated , and the 31.7 ghz data , modelled either way , is almost entirely cmb anisotropy .",
    "the ovro data at its two frequencies are shown in fig .",
    "13 of l00 , the deduced cmb anisotropy and foreground signals are shown in fig .",
    "16 of l00 , and the dust - correlated emission is shown in fig . 1 of mukherjee et al .",

    "cmb anisotropy constraints are derived from the foreground - corrected 31.7 ghz data . for the foreground contaminant , @xmath15 of the 31.7 ghz data is cmb anisotropy . ]",
    "the 31.7 ghz beam profile is well approximated by a circular gaussian of fwhm @xmath16 ( one standard deviation uncertainty ) .",
    "we use the method of grgs to account for the ovro beam uncertainty .",
    "as discussed in l00 , the noise in the 31.7 ghz data indicates the presence of a component that is correlated between neighboring fields ( this component is small compared to the uncorrelated noise in a single scan of data ) . as a result",
    "the 31.7 ghz ovro data show only one - half of the anticorrelation for nearest neighbor fields expected for a triple beam chopped experiment .",
    "this one - offdiagonal correlated noise is included and its amplitude marginalized over in our analysis .",
    "a constant offset is removed from the ovro data ; we marginalize over the amplitude of the offset to account for this in our likelihood analysis .",
    "the 1 @xmath6 absolute calibration uncertainty of the ovro data is @xmath17 , and the method developed by grgs is used to account for it .    in @xmath11 2",
    "we summarize the computational techniques used in our analysis . see grgs and r99a for detailed discussions .",
    "results are presented and discussed in @xmath11 3 .",
    "we conclude in @xmath114 .",
    "in this paper we focus on a spatially - flat cdm model with a cosmological constant @xmath0 . as a foil",
    "we also consider a spatially open model with no @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , gott 1982 ; ratra & peebles 1995 ) .",
    "these models are discussed in more detail in r99a , r99b , and r99 .",
    "the cmb anisotropy spectra in these models are generated from quantum fluctuations in weakly coupled fields during an early epoch of inflation and so are gausssian ( see , e.g. , ratra 1985 ; fischler , ratra , & susskind 1985 ) .",
    "consistent with this , the observed smaller - scale cmb anisotropy appears to be gaussian ( see , e.g. , park et al .",
    "2001 , wu et al . 2001",
    "; shandarin et al . 2002 ; polenta et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the experimental noise also appears to be gaussian , thus validating our use of the grgs likelihood analysis method .    as discussed in r99a , the spectra are parameterized by their quadrupole - moment amplitude @xmath18 , the nonrelativistic - mass density parameter @xmath1 , the baryonic - mass density parameter @xmath2 , and the age of the universe @xmath4 .",
    "the spectra are computed for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.1 , for a range of @xmath19 [ the hubble parameter @xmath20 spanning the interval 0.005 to 0.029 in steps of 0.004 , and for a range of @xmath4 spanning the interval 10 to 20 gyr in steps of 2 gyr . in total 798 spectra",
    "were computed to cover the cosmological - parameter spaces of the open and flat-@xmath0 models .",
    "examples of spectra are shown in fig . 2 of r99a , fig . 1 of r99b , and fig . 2 of r99 .",
    "following grgs , for each of the 798 spectra considered the ",
    "bare \" likelihood function is computed at the nominal beamwidth and calibration , as well as at a number of other values of the beamwidth and calibration determined from the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the likelihood function used in the derivation of the central values and limits is determined by integrating ( marginalizing ) the bare likelihood function over the beamwidth and calibration uncertainties with weights determined by the measured probability distribution functions of the beamwidth and the calibration .",
    "see grgs for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the likelihoods are a function of four parameters mentioned above : @xmath18 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we also compute marginalized likelihood functions by integrating over one or more of these parameters after assuming a uniform prior in the relevant parameters .",
    "the prior is set to zero outside the ranges considered for the parameters .",
    "grgs and r99a describe the prescription used to determine central values and limits from the likelihood functions . in what follows we consider 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath6 highest posterior density limits which include 68.3 , 95.4 , and 99.7% of the area .",
    "table 2 lists the derived values of @xmath18 and bandtemperature @xmath21 for the flat bandpower spectrum , for the ovro data .",
    "these numerical values account for the correlated noise and offset removal , the beamwidth and calibration uncertainties , and the uncertainty due to non - cmb diffuse foreground contamination removal .",
    "these results are very consistent with those of l00 . for the flat bandpower spectrum the ovro data average 1 @xmath6 @xmath21 error bar is @xmath22 @xmath21 error bar is @xmath23 for dmr ( depending on model , grski et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath24 for argo ( r99a ) , and @xmath22 for max 4 + 5 ( ganga et al . 1998 ) . ] : ovro data results in a very significant detection of cmb anisotropy , even after accounting for the uncertainties listed above .",
    "as discussed in r99a , r99b , and r99 , the four - dimensional posterior probability density distribution function @xmath25 is nicely peaked in the @xmath18 direction but fairly flat in the other three directions .",
    "marginalizing over @xmath18 results in a three - dimensional posterior distribution @xmath26 which is steeper , but still relatively flat . as a consequence ,",
    "limits derived from the four- and three - dimensional posterior distributions are generally not highly statistically significant .",
    "we therefore do not show contour plots of these functions here .",
    "marginalizing over @xmath18 and one other parameter results in two - dimensional posterior probability distributions which are more peaked ( see figs",
    ". 1 ) . as in the argo ( r99a ) ,",
    "python ( r99 ) , and combination ( r99b ) data set analyses , in some cases these peaks are at an edge of the parameter range considered .",
    "figure 1 shows that the two - dimensional posterior distributions allow one to distinguish between different regions of parameter space at a fairly high formal level of confidence .",
    "for instance , the open model near @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 gyr , and the flat-@xmath0 model near @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath29 gyr , are both formally ruled out at @xmath32 @xmath6 confidence .",
    "however , we emphasize , as discussed in r99a , r99b , and r99 , care must be exercised when interpreting the discriminative power of these formal limits , since they depend sensitively on the fact that the uniform prior has been set to zero outside the range of the parameter space we have considered .",
    "figure 2 shows the contours of the two - dimensional posterior distribution for @xmath18 and @xmath1 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional distribution over @xmath19 and @xmath4 .",
    "these are shown for the ovro and dmr data , for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models .",
    "constraints on these parameters from the ovro data are consistent with those from the dmr data .",
    "figure 3 shows the one - dimensional posterior distribution functions for @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath4 , and @xmath18 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional posterior distribution over the other three parameters . from these one - dimensional distributions ,",
    "the ovro data favors an open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model with @xmath1 = 0.33 ( 0.10 ) , or @xmath19 = 0.005 ( 0.005 ) , or @xmath4 = 10 ( 11 ) gyr , amongst the models considered . at 2 @xmath6 confidence the ovro data formally rule out only small regions of parameter space . from the one - dimensional distributions of fig .",
    "3 , the data require @xmath1 @xmath33 or @xmath34 ( @xmath1 @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) , or @xmath19 @xmath37 ( @xmath19 @xmath37 ) , or @xmath4 @xmath38 gyr ( @xmath4 @xmath38 gyr ) for the open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model at 2 @xmath6 .    while the statistical significance of the constraints on cosmological parameters is not high , it is reassuring that the ovro data favor low - density , young models , consistent with indications from most other data .",
    "the constraints on @xmath19 derived from the ovro data are somewhat puzzling .",
    "they are more consistent with those derived from the python and combination cmb anisotropy data sets analyzed by r99 and r99b , but less so with those from argo ( r99a ) and more recent data sets ( netterfield et al .",
    "2002 ; pryke et al .",
    "2002 ; stompor et al .",
    "2001 ) which favor higher @xmath19 .",
    "the lower @xmath19 found here is more consistent with the low cyburt , fields , & olive ( 2001 ) standard nucleosynthesis value determined from helium and lithium abundance measurements , and less consistent with the high deuterium - based value of burles , nollett , & turner ( 2001 ) .",
    "the peak values of the one - dimensional posterior distributions shown in fig .",
    "3 are listed in the figure caption for the case when the four - dimensional posterior distributions are normalized such that @xmath39 . with this normalization , marginalizing over the remaining parameter the fully marginalized posterior distributions are @xmath40 for the open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the indication from panels @xmath41 and @xmath42 of fig .",
    "3 that the most - favored open model is marginally more favored than the most - favored flat-@xmath0 one .",
    "the ovro data results derived here are mostly consistent with those derived from the dmr , sp94 , python i - iii , argo , max 4 + 5 , white dish and suzie data .",
    "the ovro data significantly constrains @xmath43 ( for the flat bandpower spectrum @xmath44k at 1 @xmath6 ) and weakly favors low - density , low @xmath19 , young models .",
