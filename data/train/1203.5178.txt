    "however , for systems consisting of only tens or hundreds of atoms and of a size bridging the atomic and condensed phase scales , they feature several extraordinary properties which are neither exactly the same as the mie plasmon in a classical metal sphere @xcite nor like the compressional bulk plasmon . the difference is related to the existence of discrete energy levels in small nanoparticles or atomic clusters , in contrast to the situation of continuous energy bands present in solids @xcite .    the ability of modern technology , like lithography techniques , to produce nanoparticle arrays with uniform size and shape as well as regular interparticle separations has made it possible to investigate quantitatively the far- and near - field interactions of the surface plasmons in these periodic metal - nanoparticle structures @xcite on the other hand , some artificial atomic structures @xcite with different sizes and shapes were also successfully fabricated by making use of the technique of scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) , which have been used as ideal prototpye structures for theoretical studies of collective electron oscillations ( plasmon ) , because the size and shape of these artificial structures are tunable down to the precision of a single atom . in particular , the successful assembly of linear au atomic chains on nial ( 110 ) surface with the stm technique @xcite has arisen an extensive interest in studying the plasmon excitations in small 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) atomic chains @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is important to investigate the collective optical response of these short 1-d systems directly from the first principles because mie s theory @xcite is not applicable . in this regards the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite has been approved as a powerful tool due to its ability of dealing with excited states and its high computational efficiency @xcite . by using tddft calculation in the frequency domain lian _ et .",

    "one can see that as the double chain becomes long enough ( @xmath22 ) , its two transverse modes gradually split into four branches with two low - energy resonances impulsed along @xmath6-axis and two high - energy resonances caused by a kick along @xmath23-axis ( perpendicular to the double - chain plane ) .",
    "that is to say , compared with the results of single na chains given by a previous calculation ( fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one transverse mode of a single chain now split into two due to the asymmetry between the @xmath6 and @xmath23 directions , but with similar evolution in energy as the length of the chain increases . the low - lying longitudinal @xmath24 mode behaviors similarly as in the case of single chain : it redshifts in energy as the double chain becomes longer , which results from the accumulation of collectivity in the dipole oscillation .",
    "its intensity increases near linearly with the chain length , which can arise from the reduction of the energy gaps involved in the dipole excitation @xcite . the nature of these resonances can be understood by looking at the induced charge densities at the resonance frequencies .",
    "[ fig : na2ac - ft ] shows the frequency - resolved induced densities for the double chain with @xmath1=18 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath24 is a single longitudinal mode and @xmath25 is a multipolar longitudinal mode which may be resulted from the longitudinal quantization of plasmon , as previously found in long single chains @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : na2ac - as ] correspond to the end and central transverse modes , respectively , when the kick is along @xmath23-axis ( @xmath6-axis ) .",
    "the frequencies of @xmath27 and @xmath29 modes are lower than those of the @xmath26 and @xmath28 modes , respectively , because one more atom is added in the @xmath6 direction . in both cases ,",

    "it is obvious that starting from the same smallest cluster @xmath33 the evolution of the resonance peaks in energy for the square planes is totally different from that for the single or double chains .",
    "when the impulse is along the @xmath5- or @xmath6-axis the resulting low - energy resonances @xmath34 and @xmath35 are split because of the asymmetry ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "one should note that the increase in the interatomic separation ( @xmath37 ) will lower the corresponding resonance frequency ( @xmath35 is lower in energy than @xmath34 ) .",
    "this can be understood by considering the fact that the nonlocal @xmath38 electrons can travel a bit longer distance with a larger interatomic separation in the @xmath6 direction . when the square plane becomes large enough ( @xmath39 ) some other higher - energy resonances ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : naplaneab - as ] ) begin to emerge .",
    "these resonances behave differently from @xmath34 and @xmath35 : now the @xmath44 peaks are higher in energy than the @xmath45 peaks , indicating their oscillation modes are different ( see discussion later ) .",
    "a common trend for all these plasmon resonances in the larger planes is that their energy redshifts and their strength increases near linearly with the increased size ( @xmath1 ) of the plane ( see fig .  [ fig : naplaneab - es ] ) .",
    "the linear redshift can be understood by considering the reduction of the energy gap as the cluster becomes larger .",
    "the increase in strength can be ascribed to the accumulation of collectivity in the excitation as more electrons participate in the collective oscillation .",
    "when the dipole excitation is along the @xmath23-axis , there is only one mode ( @xmath46 ) visible for the two smallest clusters ( i.e. , ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 ) , see fig .",

    "when the plane is larger than ( @xmath51 ) this resonance splits into two peaks ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) and then the @xmath53 increases its intensity rapidly and develops into a dominant plasmon resonance ( a 2-d central mode , as discussed later ) . starting from ( @xmath54 ) another high - energy mode ( @xmath55 ) emerges . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : naplaneab - es ] , the intensities of all these @xmath56 plasmon modes in the larger planes increase near linearly as the size of the plane gets larger because of the accumulation of collectivity .",

    ", the induced density is mainly distributed around the four corners of the plane , which is somewhat similar to the @xmath30 mode in single chains .",
    "this is understandable because the 2-d plane can be viewed as a zonal chain along the direction perpendicular to the impulse direction .",
    "however , the asymmetry between the @xmath5- and @xmath6-direction leads to slightly different excitation energies between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 modes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : naplaneab - as ] .",

    "similarly , @xmath42 is ee+me and @xmath43 is me+me . because the two simultaneous modes have opposite polarity the total dipole strength of these mixed modes is much smaller than @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the different plasmon excitation also lead to a different order of their excitation energies , for instance , @xmath41 has a higher energy than @xmath40 .",
    "note that the asymmetry between the @xmath5- and @xmath6-direction is the reason for the nonequivalence between the @xmath45 and @xmath44 plasmon resonances , as can be seen clearly in fig .",
