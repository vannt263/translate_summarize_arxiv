    "exotic isotopes along the neutron and proton drip lines are important for our understanding of the formation of elements and they constitute tests of our understanding of nuclear structure .",
    "the proton- and neutron - rich regimes in the chart of nuclei are therefore the focus of existing and forthcoming experimental facilities around the world  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of new degrees of freedom is one important feature of these systems ; exemplified , e.g. , by the discovery of several nuclear halo states along the drip lines  @xcite .",
    "halo states in nuclei are characterized by a tightly bound core with weakly attached valence nucleon(s ) .",
    "universal structures of such states can be considered a consequence of quantum tunneling , where tightly - bound clusters of nucleons behave coherently at low energies and the dynamics is dominated by relative motion at distances beyond the region of the short - range interaction . in the absence of the coulomb interaction , it is known that halo nuclei bound due to a large positive s - wave scattering length will show universal features  @xcite . in the case of proton halo nuclei , however , the coulomb interaction introduces an additional momentum scale @xmath1 , which is proportional to the charge of the core and the reduced mass of the halo system .",
    "the low - energy properties of proton halos strongly depend on @xmath1 .",
    "halo effective field theory ( eft ) is the ideal tool to analyze the features of halo states with a minimal set of assumptions .",
    "it describes these systems using their effective degrees of freedom , i.e. core and valence nucleons , and interactions that are dictated by low - energy constants @xcite . for s - wave proton halo systems",
    "there will be a single unknown coupling constant at leading order , and this parameter can be determined from the experimental scattering length , or the one - proton separation energy .",
    "obviously , halo eft is not intended to compete with _ ab initio _ calculations that , if applicable , would aim to predict low - energy observables from computations starting with a microscopic description of the many - body system .",
    "instead , halo eft is complementary to such approaches as it provides a low - energy description of these systems in terms of effective degrees of freedom .",
    "this reduces the complexity of the problem significantly . by construction",
    ", it can also aid to elucidate the relationship between different low - energy observables .",
    "furthermore , halo eft is built on fields for clusters , which makes it related to phenomenological few - body cluster models  @xcite .",
    "the latter have often been used successfully for confrontation with data for specific processes involving halo nuclei .",
    "a relevant example in the current context is the study of proton radiative capture into low - lying states states of  @xcite .",
    "a general discussion of electromagnetic reactions of proton halos in a cluster approach was given in @xcite .",
    "the emphasis of an eft , however , is the systematic expansion of the most general interactions and , as a consequence , the ability to estimate errors and to improve predictions order by order .",
    "the structure and reactions of one- and two - neutron halos have been studied in halo eft over the last years ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , concerning charged systems only unbound states such as @xmath2  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite have been treated in halo eft .    in this letter",
    ", we apply halo eft for the first time to one - proton halo nuclei . we restrict ourselves to leading order calculations of systems that are bound due to a large s - wave scattering length between the core and the proton .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we introduce the halo eft and discuss how coulomb interactions are treated within this framework . in the following section , we present our results and calculate , in particular , the charge form factor and charge radius at leading order .",
    "furthermore , we derive expressions for the radiative capture cross section .",
    "we apply our general formulae to the excited @xmath0 state of and compare our numerical results with existing data for this system .",
    "we conclude with an outlook and a discussion on the importance of higher - order corrections .",
