    "the scheme of molecular doppler cooling ( first displayed in @xcite ) proved to be efficient , robust and applicable to a large class of molecular species . recently highly - efficient cooling and magneto - optical trapping of diatomic molecules was demonstrated for srf @xcite and yo @xcite .",
    "the experiments on doppler / sisyphus cooling on caf @xcite , bah @xcite , mgf @xcite of sroh @xcite are currently in preparation by different groups .",
    "we recently proposed some polyatomic molecules which may be expected to be suitable for doppler cooling @xcite .",
    "the estimate for doppler limit temperature for considered molecules ( caoh , canc , mgch@xmath2 , cach@xmath2 and chiral mgchdt ) shows that it is quite realistic to reach the submillikelvin temperatures with a large class of polyatomic species ( see also recent proposal by i. kozyryev et al @xcite for a large class of polyatomic radicals amenable for doppler cooling ) . to our knowledge",
    "the only competitive method allowing currently to cool polyatomic ( four- and more - atomic ) molecules to submillikelvin temperatures is optoelectrical sisyphus cooling method @xcite .",
    "the latter method , though having great potential , relies on strong stark interaction with external field and is expected to be most effective when applied to molecules with rather large dipole moments .",
    "the method of molecular doppler cooling can be applied both to dipolar and non - dipolar species and , besides , is directly related to very well - studied , efficient and robust atomic doppler cooling technique . on the one hand electronic structure of heavy - atom molecules",
    "especially favors quasi - diagonal structure of franck - condon ( fc ) matrix between ground and excited electronic states @xcite due to more diffuse valence electronic orbital in comparison with light - atom homologues . on the other hand the molecular species containing heavy atoms present considerable interest for the experiments devoted to search for new physics outside the standard model @xcite , and to search for light dark matter candidate @xcite as well as to many other fields ( see e.g @xcite for discussion on perspectives of chiral molecules for search for parity violation )",
    "herein we extend the principles for obtaining the laser - coolable polyatomic species introduced in @xcite to the field of heavy - atom compounds and propose the polyatomic molecule raoh as a candidate for doppler cooling and for search for space parity violating ( @xmath0-odd  ) and also for both space parity and time - reversal violating ( @xmath1-odd  ) interactions with polyatomic molecules .",
    "we calculate molecular spectroscopic parameters for this molecule and estimate the completeness of the cooling loop by calculating the fc matrix for vibronic transitions between first electronic excited and ground states .",
    "we also use developed by us earlier an approach to estimate @xmath0-odd  and @xmath1-odd  parameters of effective molecular spin hamiltonian in the framework of zero order regular approximation ( zora ) .",
    "as it was pointed out in @xcite the crucial prerequisite for the closed cooling transition loop in molecules ( required for the quasi - diagonality fc matrix ) is transition of the valence electron between non - bonding orbitals being presented in the leading electronic configuration for both ground end excited electronic states . in @xcite",
    "we proposed simple scheme for obtaining the molecular structures of polyatomic species which contain non - bonding single - occupied molecular orbitals .",
    "the basic idea is to make a substitution of the halogen in the series of mx molecules ( m is the metal and x is the halogen ) to pseudo - halogen or functional groups . in our consideration",
    "the heaviest nucleus in a molecule was calcium ( with the charge number @xmath3=20 ) and , thus we can safely neglect the accounting for the relativistic effects in our electronic structure calculations . for light nucleus",
    "such an approximation indeed does not lead to noticeable changes in molecular parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the opposite case of heavy compounds one has to estimate",
    "the influence of relativistic corrections on fc - factors , known to be strongly dependent on displacements in equilibrium geometries and are sensitive to both scalar and spin - orbital relativistic effects , appeared differently in excited and ground electronic states .",
    "we started our study from calculation of equilibrium structures and normal modes for both ground and first excited electronic states of raoh using spin - averaged relativistic effective core potential ( arecp ) for ra and all - electron description of o and h. the equilibrium structures and normal mode frequencies are provided in table  [ scal - fourcomp ] . it can be seen that raoh has essentially linear geometry in both ground ( @xmath4 ) and first excited ( @xmath5 ) electronic states . to estimate the influence of the spin - orbit interaction on _ relative displacements _ in equilibrium geometries of the ground and first excited electronic states we computed the equilibrium geometries of the states of interest in the framework of fully - relativistic four - component dirac - coulomb ( dc ) hamiltonian",
    "as , came out from arecp calculations , the main interest present the vibrations of the ra - oh bond .",
    "thus we have used the simplified scheme of finding minimum of the potential energy surface by varying only the distance between ra and oh group and also the bond angle ra - o - h with the fixed equilibrium internuclear distances ( see fig [ pes ] ) .",
    "as one can see from table  [ scal - fourcomp ] , the changes in _ displacements _ of the equilibrium structures for ground and excited electronic states are rather minor when spin - orbit interaction is taken into account .",
    "particularly , raoh steadily has a linear geometry for the electronic states of interest . to check directly the influence of the spin - orbit on fc factors",
    "we have calculated these factors for 0 - 0 , 0 - 1 and 0 - 2 transition ( 0,1 and 2 are the vibrational quantum numbers ) of the quasimolecule rax , where mass of quasinucleus x is equal to the mass of oh group ( 17 a.m.u . ) for raoh , while internuclear potential is equivalent to that between ra and o nucleus in oh group from either arecp or four - component calculations",
    ". then the calculations of fc factors are performed analogously to those in @xcite and the results are presented in table  [ scal - fourcomp ] . as one can see for both spin - averaged ( arecp ) and four - component calculations the sum of the three largest fc - factors is greater than 0.9999 , thus we expect highly - closed cooling transition @xmath6 in raoh .        to estimate radiative lifetimes for the first excited @xmath7 state at the four - component fock - space relativistic coupled cluster ( fsrcc ) level , we evaluated the transition electric dipole moment ( tdm ) between this state and the ground ( @xmath8 ) one using the finite - filed method .",
    "the tdm values were derived from the finite - difference estimates for the derivative matrix elements as : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the external electric field strength and @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for left and right eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian fsrcc effective hamiltonian acting in the field - free ( @xmath13 ) model space .",
    "although the finite - field calculations involve only model space projections of many - electron wavefunctions , the resulting transition moment appriximations incorporate the bulk of the contributions from the remainder ( outer - space ) part of these wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "the computational procedure has been implemented within the dirac15 program package @xcite .",
    "then the lifetimes of several vibrational levels @xmath14 are estimated according to the formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radiation lifetime of the vibrational level @xmath14 ( in @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the modulus of the transition dipole moment between the given electronic states ( in atomic units ) , @xmath19 is the fc - factor for vibronic transition @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the energy interval between vibronic levels @xmath20 ( in wavenumbers ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the degeneracies of the upper and lower vibrational states respectively ( taken unity for both states ) .",
    "for @xmath24 we obtain the lifetime of the excited electronic state about 100@xmath25 which corresponds to doppler limit temperature @xmath26 .",
    "we have also calculated the dependence of the transition dipole moment ( tdm ) from the internuclear distance ra - oh , to check the effect of the non - franck - condon contribution depending form the derivation of the tdm on the internuclear distance ra - oh ( see fig .",
    "[ tdm ] ) .          using the program package molpro @xcite multiconfigurational self - consistent field hartree - fock ( mcscf",
    ") calculations are performed for geometry optimization and normal mode analysis without symmetry restrictions for ground and first excited electronic states of raoh . at first stage",
    "closed - shell hartree - fock calculations of the ground - state configuration of the singly charged molecular cation raoh@xmath27 are performed to obtain an initial guess for the molecular orbitals . for ra energy - consistent spin - averaged effective core potential ( arecp ) with 78 electrons included in core",
    "is used from molpro ecp library @xcite .",
    "basis set supplied with arecp is used for ra atom [ 15s,14p,8d ] , while on o and h point - like nuclei the basis sets of avtz quality are used ( [ 11s,6p,3d ] on o and [ 6s,3p ] on h ) . in mcscf calculations the electrons on five lowest molecular orbitals",
    "were frozen , while nine electrons were allowed to occupy any of the next eight molecular orbitals .",
    "thus in mcscf procedure 3920 determinants were forming 2352 configuration state functions ( csf s ) to describe either ground or two excited electronic states .",
    "all three electronic states were optimized simultaneously with equal statistical weights .",
    "subsequent computation of fc factors in the harmonic approximation were performed with hotfcht code @xcite analogously to these calculations in @xcite . in four - component calculations dirac program package",
    "is used @xcite for fsrcc computations .",
    "the code is used both for calculations of the potential curves and tdms in raoh .",
    "all - electron uncontracted dyall s basis set of triple - zeta quality ( v3z , @xcite ) was used for ra atom for calculations of the potential curves on fig .",
    "[ pes ] , while for calculations of the tdm s we employed uncontracted ano - rcc basis set by roos et al @xcite augmented with diffuse p- ( exponent 0.002 ) and d- ( exponent 0.010 ) functions , thus the basis size is [ 33s,29p,19d,13f ] . for light atoms basis set of doule - zeta quality with polarization functions by alrichs et al @xcite are employed .",
    "the fock - space vacuum ( sector ( 0,0 ) ) was the ground closed - shell state of raoh@xmath27 molecular cation .",
    "then additional electron is added to the six lowest - lying kramers pairs , which form the active space in ( 0,1 ) sector of fock space .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ scal - fourcomp ] . in calculations of the pseudomolecule rax with arecp",
    "the same basis sets as for optimization of the structure of raoh are used on all nuclei , while to account for electronic correlation we used internally contracted multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) method . in mrci calculations ten",
    "electrons were frozen on the five energetically lowest orbitals , while nine electrons were distributed on next 22 orbitals constituting the internal ci space .",
    "then single and double excitations were allowed on the 129 external orbitals , thus forming 1309803 csfs , for which the ci eigenfunction problem is then solved .",
