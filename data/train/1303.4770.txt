    "in a senior level undergraduate or a beginning graduate course , examples of phase transition are often given from the classical van der waals equation of state , and at a quantum level , from the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of an ideal bose gas.@xcite the treatment , naturally , focuses on the equation of state of the system as a function of physical parameters like the temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 , which are real .",
    "it is instructive to learn , however , that the approach towards phase transition may be studied by examining the analytical behavior of the partition function for complex values of the parameters , even for a finite system where there is no discontinuity in the derivatives of the free energy .    for a system in thermal and diffusive equilibrium ,",
    "it is convenient to calculate the ensemble average using the grand canonical partition function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath9 the fugacity .",
    "note that there is an implicit volume dependence in @xmath10 , since the eigenenergies are volume dependent .",
    "we suppress this in our notation @xmath6 for simplicity .",
    "the grand canonical partition function is a sum of positive definite terms for real positive values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and as such can not have a zero in the physical domain of these variables .",
    "lee and yang@xcite considered a lattice gas with a hard core interaction . because of the short - range repulsion between the particles , only a finite number of particles may be packed into a finite volume .",
    "as we shall see , this allows one to express @xmath10 as a finite - degree polynomial in fugacity @xmath5 .",
    "this polynomial is then completely defined in terms of its zeros on the complex fugacity plane .",
    "these zeros are all complex , coming in complex conjugate pairs . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the zeros coalesce in continuous lines , tending to pinch the positive real @xmath5 axis at a phase transition . in this paper , we show that this tendency sets in even at finite particle number and volume , with the zeros moving closer to the real axis as the particle number is increased .",
    "even though complex , the closer a zero comes to the real axis , the more it dominates real thermodynamic properties .",
    "note that the validity of the lee - yang method rests on the repulsive core between the particles .",
    "fisher  @xcite pointed out that the zeros of the canonical partition function @xmath11 on the complex @xmath4 plane have an analogous behavior .",
    "however , fisher zeros can give useful information even in the absence of the repulsive core .",
    "the fisher zeros for ideal trapped bosons were studied in the context of bec by mlken _",
    "et al._@xcite in this paper , following the work of hemmer _",
    "et al._,@xcite we study the lee - yang zeros of the classical van der waals gas ( that has a phase transition with a critical temperature ) and compare it with a calogero gas@xcite ( that has no phase transition ) .",
    "the ideal bose gas ( which undergoes a phase transition at bec ) is studied in some detail , both using the grand canonical and the canonical formalisms . the heat capacity per particle in the grand canonical and canonical ensembles",
    "are compared at bec to check how close these are for finite particle number . since there is no short - range repulsion in the ideal bose gas , the lee - yang zeros are not meaningful , but the fisher zeros are .",
    "accordingly , we find the pattern of these on the complex @xmath4 plane for 50 and 100 atoms . even for such small number of particles , we see a clear tendency for the zeros to close in on the real @xmath4 axis .",
    "the calculations are done for the exact @xmath11 as well as the more commonly used continuous density of states .",
    "this will be discussed after the patterns of zeros are presented .",
    "the grand partition function , on the other hand , is shown to have a pole at phase transition for real @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite a nontrivial modification over the ideal gas will be to introduce interparticle interaction through virial coefficients in the grand potential,@xcite and study how the zeros of the grand canonical partition function shift on the complex plane .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the canonical partition function ( for fixed @xmath13 ) is defined as z_n()=_e_i^(n ) ( -e_i^(n ) )  , [ eq:01 ] where @xmath14 are the complete set of eigenenergies of the @xmath13-body system including states in the continuum , if any .",
    "the sum is taken over all states @xmath15 including the degeneracies .",
    "since the energies @xmath14 depend on the volume of the system , there is a volume dependence in @xmath11 .",
    "the grand canonical partition function , on the other hand , allows for particle exchange ( in addition to energy ) via the reservoir , and is defined as ( , z)=_n=0^_e_i^(n ) ( -e_i^(n)+n )  = _",

    "the simplest example is an ideal classical gas in a volume @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath13-particle canonical partition function is the @xmath13th power of the one - particle partition function @xmath18 .",
    "the latter is calculated by integrating @xmath19 over the phase space divided by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the planck s constant .",
    "the net result is z_n()=  ( ) ^n  , [ eq:03 ] where @xmath22 is the thermal wave length , and the customary division by @xmath23 has been made to preserve the extensive property of the entropy . by substituting eq .",

    "( [ eq:02 ] ) , we obtain ^(0 ) ( , z)=  , [ eq:04 ] where the superscript on @xmath10 denotes a non - interacting system .",
    "more generally , for an interacting gas with short - range interparticle repulsion , eq .  ( [ eq:02 ] ) shows that @xmath10 is a _ finite degree _ polynomial in @xmath5 , and therefore may be completely defined in terms of its zeros .",
    "these zeros , however , can not be on the real positive @xmath5-axis , since every term in eq .",

    "there is a phase transition at some temperature , a zero and its complex conjugate tend to pinch the real @xmath5 axis .",

    "the pressure @xmath28 remains continuous , but its slope as a function of @xmath29 is not the same .",
    "moreover , in the thermodynamic limit , the number density @xmath30 may be discontinuous as a function of @xmath29 in the interface of two phases ( see finkelstein . )    for our example in the next section , it is more relevant to take a finite volume @xmath17 which contains @xmath13 particles . if there is a hard - core repulsion",
