    "molecular clumps , massive ( m@xmath410@xmath12m@xmath5 ) and cold ( t@xmath830k ) condensations of dense gas and dust ( @xmath13 g @xmath14 ) with sizes between 0.1 and few parsecs , are the primary sites for the formation of stellar clusters . either by accretion of turbulent cores fragmenting into the clump @xcite or by a more dynamical process of competitive accretion where initial seeds migrate within the clump hunting for material to accrete @xcite , clump - hosted protoclusters are the sites where intermediate and high - mass stars form ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence that clumps hosting massive cores in very early stages of formation are already associated with populations of lower mass ysos visible in the near - ir and hence relatively more evolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the early products in clump - hosted protoclusters appear to be relatively low mass ysos , the appearance of intermediate and high - mass forming protostars is the event that drives the radiative energy budget in these systems .",
    "@xcite showed that the massive forming objects accreting with a rate proportional to their mass @xcite show a dramatic increase in radiated bolometric luminosity as a function of time while their core envelope mass decreases only slightly ; this can be followed very conveniently in a l@xmath15-m@xmath16 diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ lm - diag ] ) where simple - model evolutionary tracks mark the path of star - forming clumps along three basic phases .",
    "initially clumps are `` pre - stellar '' or undergoing very low rates of star formation ( red dots ) , with an sed resembling very well a modified blackbody with no detectable continuum at @xmath17 100 @xmath18 m . in a second phase , that we call `` protostellar '' ,",
    "the clump starts to exhibit far - infrared continuum radiation well in excess of a single - temperature modified blackbody ; this is interpreted as the indication that ongoing star formation becomes able to significantly heat the clump s interior ( the blue dots ) . as accretion proceeds the clumps increase their luminosity more and more ( following the ascending portion of the model evolutionary tracks in fig .",
    "[ lm - diag ] ) until they reach the luminosity typical for ultracompact ( uc)hii regions ( see fig . 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent evolution is modelled as envelope dispersal by stellar winds and outflows .",
    "independent evolutionary indications from the association with methanol masers or radio continuum @xcite or with the properties of ammonia dense gas @xcite are consistent with the predictions in @xcite .    with the hi - gal  project @xcite , we detected and characterised several tens of thousands of dense clumps @xcite , enabling statistical studies mapping star formation history and rates throughout the milky way @xcite .",
    "it is then important that sfr probes as well as evolutionary tools like the l@xmath15-m@xmath16 diagram are better and better characterised and _ calibrated _ against indicators that can independently probe the temperatures of the gas in the innermost regions of massive clumps , where the most massive ysos are forming . among the best tracers in this respect",
    "is ch@xmath0c@xmath1h  ( methyl - acetylene ) , that is optically thin in most typical conditions in massive clumps and whose @xmath19-ladder rotational transitions are collisionally excited at densities in excess of 10@xmath20@xmath3(e.g . , @xcite ) .",

    "we can distinguish three ranges of l / m : the rate is 0 ( none out of 23 sources ) for the sources with l / m@xmath32 , 58% ( 7 out of 12 ) for sources with 1@xmath33l / m@xmath3310 , and 90% ( 16 out of 18 sources ) for sources with l / m@xmath3410 . in three cases , sources # 32 , 35 and 38 as indicated in the table , at least the k=0 line is detected but the 4-component gaussian fit to the four lines did not converge and so no further analysis could be carried out for these sources .",

    "is a temperature probe for gas with densities in excess of 10@xmath20 @xmath3  @xcite , its values are influenced more by the inner clump regions and relatively less by the outer envelope .",
    "looking at figure [ lm - diag ] , the range of l / m @xmath6  1 is characteristic of `` pre - stellar '' clumps ( in which , contrary to the sources of the present study , 70 @xmath18 m  emission is not detected ) ; the internal input energy producing the detectable 70 @xmath18 m  flux would not seem sufficient to drive up considerably the bolometric luminosity as well as the internal clump temperature , resulting in non - detections in ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  for any of the sources with l / m@xmath331 .",
    "this suggests that in these clumps intermediate or high - mass star formation has not yet started .    above the l / m=1 threshold , corresponding to the upper envelope of the `` pre - stellar '' clumps distribution in fig .",

    "@xcite report a ch@xmath0c@xmath1h  abundance that is proportional to temperature in a sample of dense clumps , a result that is interpreted as evidence of desorption from grain ice mantles .",
    "the sharp rise in ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  detection statistics for l / m@xmath101 may then be the result of a combination of the incipient star formation activity in the clumps that raises the temperature at the levels required to excite the ( 12 - 11 ) transition ( @xmath36=37k ) and to desorb a sufficient amount of ch@xmath0c@xmath1h  from the the grains ice mantle .",
    "although a more quantitative characterization of the effect would require mapping data in this species , that we do not have , we believe that the qualitative evolutionary interpretation of the changes in ch@xmath0c@xmath1h  detection rate with l / m is convincing .    above the l / m=10 threshold the energy budget produced internally is such that clumps are all detected in ch@xmath0c@xmath1h .      while the ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  detection statistics therefore confirms the working hypothesis of l / m as an evolutionary indicator , the information derived from the measured temperature of the ch@xmath0c@xmath1h  gas provide a clear _ quantitative _ indication in this sense .",
    "figure [ lm - t_plot ] presents the ch@xmath0c@xmath1h  temperature as a function of l / m , for the detected sources ( all with l / m @xmath34 1 ) .",
    "we find that the derived temperature for all sources detected between l / m=1 and @xmath910 is t@xmath6  35 k irrespectively of l / m . for l / m@xmath3410",

    "the full line represents the power - law relationship discussed in the text ( @xmath37 discussed in ",

    "[ lm - t_plot],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the l / m thresholds that we indicatively put at 1 and 10 to characterize ch@xmath0c@xmath1h  detection statistics seem then to have a more robust foundation in change in the energy budget produced by the star formation process in these clumps , also looking at the location of these two l / m thresholds in the l - m diagram of figure [ lm - diag ] : the cyan line for l / m=1 and the magenta line for l / m=10 .",
    "we already noted how the l / m=1 threshold that marks a abrupt change in ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  detection statistics corresponds to the upper envelope of the distribution of `` pre - stellar '' clumps from @xcite ; the protostellar sources in this l / m range are indistinguishable from `` pre - stellar '' ( other than for the 70@xmath18 m  counterpart ) , and indeed ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  is not detected .",
    "protostellar clumps leave the l - m area occupied by the `` pre - stellar '' clumps at l / m=1 , where new processes must be kicking in to raise the temperature of the inner regions of the clump to levels that allow ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  detection ; however , a further moderate increase in l / m up to 10 does not seem to translate into a significant increase of temperature . in a simplified model of a spherical and optically thick dust clump heated by an internal source",
    "we would expect that a raise of a factor 10 ( for the same clump mass ) of the bolometric luminosity should generate a detectable change in temperature . to quantify this effect",
    ", we carried out a set of tests with the dust radiative transfer code transphere-1d made publicly available by c.p .",
    "dullemond ( adapted from @xcite ) to model the clump sed and temperature structure in spherical geometry .",
    "we initially fixed the inner envelope radius to r@xmath38=200au and density gradient @xmath39 , varying the internal input luminosities l@xmath40 and inner envelope densities .",
    "for each run we computed a volume - averaged dust temperature @xmath41 in the region where @xmath42 @xmath3 , that is the gas density regime traced by our observations ; we note that dust and gas should be thermally coupled in these dense regimes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain that the two quantities are always related by a power - law of the form @xmath43 ; the other model parameters ( like inner density or outer radius ) affect the proportionality constant and are not interesting here as we want to characterise a trend in relative terms . the @xmath44 relationship is reported in fig .",

    "/ m is remarkably well - reproduced by the model .",
    "the few points with l / m@xmath45 in the figure , however , do not follow this expected trend .",
    "we speculate that a possible reason for this is that the assumption of a central heating source in a spherically symmetric clump might not apply for such clumps . in a competitive accretion paradigm where the initial protostellar seed objects do not form at the center of the hosting clumps ,",
    "our model assumption would not apply ; it is quite plausible that a more shallow spatial distribution of heating sources in the clumps may give rise to a warmer ( on average ) envelope than in the case of a distribution strongly peaked at the clump center . in other words",
    ", we are proposing that the constancy of temperature with luminosity in the 1@xmath6  l / m@xmath6  10 region is not due to a missing increase of temperature as a function of l / m , but rather to an excess temperature for relatively low l / m due to the formation of protostellar seeds away form the clump center .",
    "we will investigate this possibility in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "together with the ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  detection statistics going virtually to 100% , the rise in gas temperature in fig .",
    "[ lm - t_plot ] for l / m@xmath1010 suggests a further increase of internal input luminosity at the center of the clump that could be due to an increase in the number of forming ysos in the clump as well as to their increased luminosity production due to a substantial raise in mass .",
    "we believe that the second effect is the dominant one .",
    "the magenta large squares in figure [ lm - diag ] represent the hi - gal sources where radio continuum from thermal free - free modelled as hii region emission has been identified by @xcite in the cornish survey @xcite .",
    "the remarkable correspondence of the l / m=10 threshold ( indicated with the magenta line in figure [ lm - diag ] ) with the lower envelope of the distribution of hi - gal clumps associated with hii regions , strongly suggests that the rise in gas temperature for l / m@xmath1010 is mostly due to the appearance of a first zams intermediate / high - mass star in the clump .",
    "clump mass for hi - gal detected clumps from @xcite , with distribution of `` pre - stellar '' clumps ( no 70 @xmath18 m  counterpart ) indicated with red source density contours and distribution of protostellar clumps ( with 70 @xmath18 m  counterpart ) indicated with the blue contours ; tracks are from @xcite .",
    "magenta squares are the subsample of protostellar clumps that have a uchii counterpart in the cornish survey @xcite and that have been studied in detail by @xcite .",

    "[ lm - t_plot ] ) .",
    "[ lm - diag],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    based on the results presented we propose an evolutionary classification for massive protostellar clumps in which a 70 @xmath18 m  counterpart is detected , based on the l / m ratio of the clumps :    * a relatively quiescent phase characterised by l / m@xmath61 where relatively low - mass objects may be forming .",
    "such seeds of star formation might be either low - mass ysos or intermediate / massive ysos in the pristine stages of evolution .",
    "these clumps differ from pre - stellar clumps of similar l / m in the appearance of a 70@xmath18 m  counterpart detection ; yet the internal input energy does not seem sufficient to warm up the clumps to a detectable level in ch@xmath0c@xmath1h . * an intermediate phase where 1@xmath6l / m @xmath610 , in which the clump internal input power due to star formation is sufficient to warm up the envelope and be detectable in ch@xmath0c@xmath1h , but where the increase in input power does not seem to reflect in a temperature increase of the densest portions of the envelope , as expected from simple radiative transfer models of spherical clumps heated by a central power source .",
    "we argue that this could reflect a phase , consistently with protocluster competitive accretion scenarios , in which protostellar seeds are not forming strictly in the center of the clumps but with a more shallow spatial distribution in the clumps ; plausibly such a configuration , for which detailed radiative transfer modelling is needed , is more efficient to warm up the inner regions of the envelope than the centrally peaked input power case .",
    "while the luminosity of forming protostars increases , their migration toward denser regions of the clumps makes them less effective in raising the overall envelope temperature .",
    "* a third phase with l / m@xmath1010 , where the further dramatic increase in luminosity starts warm up the clump more and more .",
    "the association of the l / m=10 threshold with the location in the l - m diagram where hii region counterparts to hi - gal sources are found ( see figure [ lm - diag ] ) is an indication that this luminosity increase is related to the birth of the first intermediate / high - mass zams stars in the clusters .    in a parallel effort we are producing an extensive montecarlo grid of sed models for synthetic protoclusters embedded in massive clumps spanning masses between 10@xmath46 and 10@xmath47 m@xmath5 , dust temperatures between 10 and 40k , ages of embedded ysos cluster from 510@xmath47 to 5 10@xmath20 years and star formation efficiencies up to 40% ( molinari & robitaille , in preparation ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the properties of the models grid shows that irrespectively of the various models parameters , @xmath980% of the models showing l / m@xmath410 contain at least one zams star and , for clump masses greater than 10@xmath12m@xmath5  ( our source selection criterion ) , the most massive zams star formed is of spectral class b1 or earlier for nearly 100% of the models .",
    "a thorough analysis and discussion is deferred to the paper in preparation , but this preliminary analysis seem to confirm that the birth of a b1 zams star ( or earlier ) is associated with the crossing of the l / m=10 threshold ; such stars nominally produce n@xmath48 @xcite that is comparable to the lower values of the lyman continuum derived by @xcite from the radio flux of the cornish counterparts to hi - gal clumps .",
    "observations of the ch@xmath0c@xmath1h(j=12 - 11 )  line towards 51 protostellar massive clumps selected from the hi - gal survey provide a clear indication that the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of a clump can be used to diagnose the star formation evolutionary stage of the clumps .",
    "three stages are identified corresponding to three intervals in l / m values .",
    "l / m@xmath61 in which star formation is either in its very early stages or only low - mass ysos are forming ; 1 @xmath6l / m @xmath610 in which clumps build up their luminosities and temperature , due to ongoing evolution of relatively low - mass protostars ; l / m @xmath1010 in which inner clump gas temperature rises with l / m likely due to the first appearance of intermediate and high - mass zams stars .",
