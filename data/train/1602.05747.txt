    "we thus close this section by summarizing that the soi hamiltonian on a curved surface acting on a wavefunction is given by @xmath83",
    "having derived the hamiltonian for the rsoi on a curved surface , we now use this hamiltonian to analyze the effects of curvature on the spin accumulation via two distinct techniques .    in the first technique , we invoke the adiabatic approximation in which we assume that the geometric curvature is gentle enough that the spin of charge carriers adiabatically follow the direction of the local soi field .",
    "we show that the change in momentum of the charge carriers moving along the curved trajectory has an analogous effect to the acceleration of the charge carriers by an electric field in the spin hall effect and leads to an out of plane spin accumulation .    in the second technique ,",

    "this idea was later exploited by fujita and co - authors @xcite to explain the out of plane spin accumulation in the spin hall effect . there , the role of the time varying magnetic field is played by the rsoi field , and the time variation of the field caused by an applied electric field .",
    "the acceleration in the direction of the electric field causes the momentum direction to rotate towards the direction of the field .",
    "the direction of the rsoi field is perpendicular to that of the momentum , and rotates along with the momentum .",
    "we show here that instead of applying an electric field , the change in the momentum direction of a particle as it moves along a curved path can give rise to an analogous effect .",

    "note that the integral on the left hand side is _ not _ , in general , the integral of the normal spin current flowing along the longitudinal direction .",

    "consider a non - planar curved surface similar to the ones considered in the previous section with a finite transverse width along the @xmath1 direction , and infinite length along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the translational invariance along the @xmath2 direction allows the wavefunction of an eigenstate to assume the form of @xmath207 .",
    "the finite width of the segment is imposed by setting the boundary condition that the transverse wavefunction vanishes at the two edges where @xmath208 .",

    "the numerical solution of the eigenstates for a planar waveguide follows largely the same ideas where similarly care must be taken to account for the position dependence of the metric tensor .      to illustrate the emergence of an out of plane spin polarization on a planar curved waveguide discussed in sect .",

    "since this is a planar waveguide , the usual rsoi hamiltonian on the flat @xmath0 plane @xmath227 applies inside the waveguide .",

    "( the parameters of the waveguide and the energy can be tuned so that the contributions of the rsoi to the group velocity has the same sign as that of the kinetic energy contribution @xmath230 . )",
    "thus , the spin @xmath33 accumulation is negative throughout the entire period of the waveguide because the charge carriers travelling from the left to the right of the figure always have a positive velocity in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "the sign of the spin @xmath32 accumulation alternates with the @xmath33 velocity of the charge carriers as they move along alternating sections of the waveguide curving towards the positive and negative @xmath33 directions .",
    "in contrast , in a perfectly straight waveguide aligned along the @xmath32 direction @xmath231 for a @xmath91 eigenstate and the spin @xmath32 polarization is identically 0 everywhere .",
    "the rotation of the in - plane spin polarizations in turn imply the existence of an out of plane torque which imparts an out of plane spin polarization .",
    "thus , the spin @xmath4 accumulation is positive ( negative ) in those segments of the waveguide where the spins rotate clockwise ( anticlockwise ) as they travel from left to right .",
    "we next verify the existence of an out of plane spin accumulation in a non - planar curved surface by considering a deformed c arc with a finite arc width where points on the arc are given by @xmath232 where @xmath5 is the standard cylindrical coordinate .",
    "this represents an arc with a linear decrease in the radius with the azimuthal angle proportional to @xmath233 .",
    "the linear decrease has been introduced to break the reflection symmetry of the arc about its middle . in keeping with the standard convention for cylindrical coordinates",
    "we now let @xmath4 be the infinitely long , translationally invariant direction instead of @xmath32 in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath1 direction now refers to the @xmath4 direction , while @xmath2 remains the tangential direction along the arc .    in order to study the effects of curvature and transverse symmetry breaking , we focus on 3 specific cases of an arc with @xmath234 , an arc with @xmath235 , and a flat waveguide .",
    "all of these waveguides have the same transverse arc length of @xmath236 .",
    "we take @xmath237 and @xmath238 corresponding to that for an inas heterostructure .",

    "time reversal symmetry implies that for a fixed value of @xmath91 , @xmath245 so that @xmath246 . since the value of @xmath247 is independent of @xmath32 due to translational invariance along the @xmath32 direction the only value it can assume is 0 everywhere .    in agreement with the prediction of eq .",

    "we then used the heisenberg equations of motion to analyze the relationships between spin currents and accumulations on curved waveguides .",
    "we showed that for the eigenstates of a time independent rsoi hamiltonian , the spin torque on the charge carriers due to the soi field can be understood as being balanced off by the divergence in the spin currents and additional terms due to curvature on a curved waveguide .",
