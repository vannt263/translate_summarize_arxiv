    "the study of periodic orbits in dynamical systems is a basic problem with a long history . in a variety of examples",
    "one would like to find periodic orbits , and to study their properties and general structure .",
    "this is of great importance , for instance , in taking the semi - classical limit of dynamical systems @xcite , or for computing averages of observables in both classical and quantum chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the case of flows in three dimensional manifolds .",
    "a periodic orbit of such a flow is an embedding of @xmath1 into the 3-manifold , hence a knot , and one can ask which knot types arise as periodic orbits for a certain flow , or what knot invariants ( if any ) do they share .    this problem was considered by birman and williams in @xcite and @xcite , who analyzed two examples .",
    "the first example is the flow associated with the famous lorenz equations .",
    "here it was shown that the family of knots arising as periodic orbits , the so called lorenz knotshas very special properties . as an example of their results we mention that lorenz knots are prime and every lorenz link is a fibered link , and a positive braid .",
    "these results are based on the fact that all periodic orbits of the lorenz flow are described by a simple combinatorial construction , called the template .",
    "the lorenz template is given in figure [ lorenz_template ] below , together with a typical periodic orbit .",
    "all periodic orbits of the equations arise as orbits in the lorenz template .",
    "the second example considered by birman and williams is the suspension flow on the complement of the figure eight knot in @xmath0 .",
    "they have also constructed a template for the periodic orbits of this system .",
    "but , remarkably , here it was shown by ghrist @xcite that the template is in fact a universal template : every possible knot in @xmath0 arises as a periodic orbit of this flow , without exception . in the same paper ghrist has shown that some templates termed lorenz - like , studied before by sullivan @xcite are also universal .",
    "in particular , even one half twist in one of the ears of the lorenz template gives rise to a universal template , see figure [ lorenz_like_template ] .",
    "thus , constructing a template for a given flow has far reaching consequences in the study of knot types arising as periodic orbits , enabling a description of their knot invariants , or a proof of their universality .",
    "the construction , however , is necessarily very delicate , since even seemingly minute changes can dramatically affect the properties of the knots produced by the template .",
    "in the important case of hyperbolic flows birman and williams have proved that a template always exists @xcite , but its explicit construction in specific cases remains a difficult challenge . even within the well - studied class of hyperbolic flows consisting of geodesic flows on the unit tangent bundle of surfaces of constant negative curvature ,",
    "the first construction of a template was achieved only recently , for the modular surface .",
    "namely , ghys @xcite established the extraordinary fact that the modular template coincides with the lorenz template .",
    "in particular , this fact implies that the modular knots share the special properties of the lorenz knot family mentioned above .",
    "it is a compelling problem to understand which properties of the periodic orbits of the modular surface ( if any ) hold for the periodic orbits of the geodesic flows on other surfaces .",
    "the first step in the solution of this problem is constructing templates for these flows , and this will be our goal in the present paper",
    ".      we will focus on a class of surfaces which form a natural generalization of the modular surface , namely the class of orbifolds with two cone points of orders @xmath2 and @xmath3 and one cusp , with @xmath3 odd .",
    "the modular surface appears as the first member of this family , with @xmath4 .",
    "alternatively , the surfaces in question arise as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hecke triangle group associated with the triangle @xmath7 .    we will give a complete description of the template for the geodesic flow on the unit tanget bundle of these surfaces .",
    "consideration of orbifolds with a cone point of arbitrary order gives rise to significant new phenomena and is considerably more complicated than the case of the modular surface . to begin with ,",
    "let us note that ghys proof makes essential use of the fact that the unit tangent bundle of the modular surface can be identified with the complement of the trefoil knot in the unit sphere @xmath0 .",
    "this identification is implemented via the embedding of the space of unimodular lattices in @xmath8 into @xmath9 afforded by the weierstrass invariants @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "however , we will see that the modular surface is the only surface in our class whose unit tangent bundle can be identified with the complement of a knot in @xmath0 .",
    "for all other surfaces in our class , the unit tangent bundle is identified with the complement of a knot in a non - trivial lens space .",
    "it is only the lift of this knot to @xmath0 which is the @xmath12 torus knot , generalizing the @xmath13 case of the modular surface .",
    "we note that the lens space in question is not determined uniquely , and in fact the unit tangent bundle of each @xmath12 orbifold embeds into a specific countable family of lens spaces , whose parameters are given as explicit functions of the euler number of the bundle and @xmath14 .",
    "the templates we construct are the ones arising for euler number zero . for the case of the @xmath15 orbifold , for example",
    ", we obtain :        note that the template contains the lorenz template as a subtemplate",
    ". this will be the case for the templates we construct for all the @xmath12 orbifolds , thus , the templates we construct are extensions of the basic lorenz template .",
    "this is only due to the specific choice of euler number zero , as other choices of non - zero euler number will not give rise to a subtemplate with two unlinked ears each of which is the unknot . in a subsequent paper",
    "we plan to use the templates constructed here to prove all knots arising as periodic orbits are prime knots .",
    "the case of @xmath12 with euler number zero is also considered in the forthcomoing thesis of pierre dehornoy @xcite , and any two orbits are found to be negatively linked .",
    "going back to the case of the modular surface , we note that here too a countable family of lens spaces is obtained in our construction , and it is a remarkable fact that the choice of euler number zero is the choice producing the lorenz template , and at the same time is the only one which gives the lens space @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , our approach gives a direct geometric proof of ghys result which makes no use of weierstrass functions .",
    "* the description of the geodesic flow on the modular surface as a flow in the complement of the trefoil knot in @xmath0 , and the identification of the modular knots as lorenz knots poses the following intriguing question .",
    "is it possible to identify a lorenz - invariant trefoil knot , in the complement of which the lorenz flow takes place ?",
    "we believe this is indeed the case , and specifically that the invariant curves connecting the two isolated fixed points of the lorenz flow form a trefoil .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for further discussion of this matter .",
    "the paper is organized as folllows : in  2 we introduce some preliminaries regarding hyperbolic geometry , in  3 after some preliminaries on lens spaces and seifert fibered spaces we discuss the possible embeddings of the unit tangent bundle , in  4 we briefly describe the theory of templates and then construct the templates for the geodesic flows on the @xmath12 orbifolds .",
    "the author wishes to thank professor yoav moriah and professor amos nevo for numerous crucial discussions .",
    "let @xmath16 be the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the tangent bundle @xmath17 at any point @xmath18 is a plane .",
    "now let @xmath19 be the unit tangent bundle of @xmath16 , with fiber at each point consisting of all vectors of norm 1 , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "we call the fiber over a point the circle of directions at that point . as @xmath16 is simply connected @xmath19 is a trivial bundle , and can be described as the set of pointers @xmath20 where @xmath18 and @xmath21 is an angle representing the unit vector @xmath22 in the plane @xmath23 . recall that @xmath24 , and the stabilizer @xmath25 of a point @xmath26 consists of all rotations about @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is thus naturally identified with the @xmath1 fiber above @xmath27 in @xmath19 , and in particular , @xmath29 .",
    "fix a pointer @xmath30 in @xmath19 .",
    "the homeomorphism is then explicitly given by g : b(b^-1(i),db^-1_i(/2 ) ) for any @xmath31 .",
    "any path @xmath32 in @xmath16 has a natural lift to @xmath19 , by @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath34 be two isotopic paths in @xmath16 .",
    "the isotopy may induce an isotopy between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , if the unit tangent vectors at any point @xmath37 are continuously deformed one to the other by the differential of the isotopy . in this case",
    "the isotopy is called a _ regular isotopy _ , and can be regarded as an isotopy in @xmath19 .",
    "the geodesic flow @xmath38 on @xmath16 is defined as the flow taking a pointer in @xmath19 by parallel transport along the unique geodesic in @xmath16 passing through it , a distance @xmath37 .",
    "let us define for any @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath38 is conjugated by @xmath41 defined above to a flow on @xmath42 , given by @xmath43 .",
    "now , for any pointer in @xmath19 we can consider a horocycle corresponding to the endpoint of the geodesic it defines , @xmath44 , and the horocycle corresponding to the geodesic s starting point , @xmath45 .",
    "we consider these horocycles in the unit tangent bundle , for @xmath44 with all directions pointing toward the endpoint , and for @xmath45 with all directions pointing away from the starting point , as in figure [ horocycles ] .",
    "the one parameter group @xmath46 defines the flow along the horocycle @xmath44 , and the one parameter group @xmath47 along @xmath45 . as @xmath48",
    ", we see that the images of points on the horocycle @xmath49 approach each other under the geodesic flow , exponentially fast . in the same manner ,",
    "@xmath50 and so points on @xmath45 diverge exponentially fast under the geodesic flow .",
    "we also note that the geodesic and the two horocycles through a point in @xmath19 are transversal , as can be seen in figure [ horocycles ] .",
    "let @xmath51 be an orbifold of dimension @xmath14 .",
    "we will use only the case of dimension 2 , but the definitions are the same for any dimension .",
    "take an orbifold atlas for @xmath52 .",
    "each chart in the atlas is of the form @xmath53 , where each @xmath54 is an open subset of @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is a finite group acting linearly and faithfully on @xmath55 .",
    "the tangent bundle of @xmath51 is the @xmath57 dimensional orbifold defined by the charts @xmath58 where @xmath59 acts by @xmath60 .    if @xmath52 is a good orbifold , i.e. a quotient of a manifold @xmath61 by a properly discontinuous group action @xmath62 , the tangent bundle @xmath63 is homeomorphic to @xmath64 . for the full definitions",
    "see @xcite , page 92 .",
    "let @xmath65 be a fuchsian group acting on @xmath16 .",
    "the quotient @xmath66 is a two dimensional orbifold .",
    "it inherits a hyperbolic structure from @xmath16 , and its tangent bundle is @xmath67 . in this case , it is possible to define also the unit tangent bundle @xmath68 , as the group acts by isometries .",
    "the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle is defined to be @xmath69 , namely by projecting the flow @xmath70 defined above for @xmath42 via @xmath62 .",
    "we now turn to the orbifolds which are the subject of our discussion .",
    "consider the @xmath71 hecke triangle group @xmath72 . by considering any two points of distance @xmath73 in @xmath16 and taking @xmath74 to be a rotation of order @xmath75 about the first and @xmath76 a rotation of order @xmath77 about the other",
    ", we arrive at a representation of @xmath78 into @xmath42 .",
    "any two representations corresponding to the same distance @xmath79 are conjugate since the isometry group is distance transitive .    for any @xmath80 there exists a distance @xmath81 for which the image of the representation is discrete , yet the orbifold @xmath66 is of finite volume .",
    "the representations for which the distance equals @xmath81 are called lattice representations of @xmath62 and we denote the set of all such representations by @xmath82 .",
    "denote the orbifold corresponding to any representation in @xmath82 by @xmath83 .",
    "this orbifold has two cone points of order @xmath14 and @xmath3 and one cusp . for a distance @xmath84 the volume of",
    "the orbifold becomes infinite , that is the cusp has opened .",
    "denote the orbifold corresponding to @xmath84 by @xmath85 .",
    "a representation in @xmath82 is determined by one pointer : a cone point in @xmath16 of order @xmath3 and any one of the @xmath3 directions equally spaced along the circle of directions at that point , pointing to the neighboring @xmath86cone points .",
    "we thus regard @xmath82 as a set of pointers .",
    "let us fix a representation @xmath87 .",
    "that is , @xmath88 has a @xmath89cone point at @xmath90 and an @xmath86cone point at distance @xmath81 upwards along the imaginary axis .",
    "@xmath88 acts transitively on all @xmath89cone points , and by rotations by @xmath91 around @xmath90 ( and any other @xmath89cone point ) , hence @xmath88 normalizes itself and @xmath92 .",
    "it also true of course that @xmath93 as in  [ orbifolds ] .",
    "we will use in the sequel the following homeomorphism : h : psl_2()/_0l ( ) + h : b_0(b(i ) , db_i(/2 ) ) . note that although @xmath94 is very similar to @xmath41 defined in section [ hutb ] , the action of @xmath94 is on the quotient spaces and in the opposite direction .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the unit tangent bundle to the modular orbifold @xmath95 is homeomorphic to the complement of a trefoil in @xmath0 . the homeomorphism is implemented by the weierstrass invariants , and was used by ghys in @xcite to compute the template of the modular flow .",
    "however , the fact that unit tangent bundle is a subset of @xmath0 is in fact unique to the modular surface among the surfaces we consider , as we will see below",
    ".    we will give a direct geometric description of the unit tangent bundle to @xmath83 as a three manifold .",
    "we will subsequently describe the template for the geodesic flow embedded therein .",
    "we note however , that the best one can attain for the general case is that for any orbifold @xmath83 , the unit tangent bundle has ( infinitely many ) embeddings into lens spaces .",
    "these are parametrized by the euler number , and we will see later on that the choice of the embedding with euler number zero gives rise to a template generalizing the lorenz template .",
    "this chapter is organized a follows : we begin in  [ lens ] and  [ seifert ] with brief reminders on lens spaces and seifert fibered spaces , and in  3.3 we describe the structure of @xmath96 as a seifert fibered space . in ",
    "3.4 we define a certain vector field on the orbifolds @xmath97 . in  3.5 we parametrize the embeddings by the euler number , and finally in  3.6 we describe explicitly the embeddings of @xmath97 into the relevant lens spaces , given by the vector field .      the lens space @xmath98 , for integers @xmath99 , is defined to be the quotient of @xmath0 by the following action of @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the vectors of norm 1 in @xmath101 , then any @xmath102 acts by @xmath103 .",
    "this action is free , thus the resulting space @xmath104 is a compact three dimensional manifold .",
    "another description of the same manifold is as follows : let @xmath105 and @xmath106 be two solid tori . fix a longitude and meridian generators @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "then choose an orientation reversing homeomorphism @xmath110 so that @xmath111 . then the lens space @xmath98 is given by gluing @xmath112",
    ".    the homeomorphism between the two representations can be seen by a straightforward identification as follows .",
    "consider the polar parameterization @xmath113 of @xmath101 .",
    "for a point in @xmath0 , @xmath114 .",
    "this gives a parameterization @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , with obvious identifications for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this is the well known parameterization of @xmath0 by concentric tori sketched in figure [ tori ] .",
    "the radii are invariant under the @xmath100 action and so @xmath121 is invariant under the action , thus each of the tori is an invariant set .",
    "the action on each torus is given by @xmath122 .",
    "fix some @xmath123 .",
    "this gives a decomposition of @xmath0 to two solid tori .",
    "for the inner solid torus , i.e. the union of tori @xmath124 a meridian is given by @xmath125 .",
    "as can be seen from the action , the quotient is the torus resulting from @xmath126 , by identifying the two disks in the boundary with a twist by @xmath127 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 remains a meridian for the quotient torus .",
    "this meridian is a longitude for the other torus in @xmath0 , @xmath128 .",
    "the image of the longitude is a @xmath129 curve in the quotient of the outer torus , and the equivalence of the definitions follows .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite .          in the section below we recall some terminology and facts about seifert fiber spaces which can also be found in ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an orientable @xmath130-manifold is called a _",
    "seifert fiber space _ if it is a disjoint union of fibers homeomorphic to @xmath1 , such that each fiber has a solid torus neighborhood , foliated by fibers which are not meridians for it .",
    "a _ seifert torus _ of type @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 coprime integers , is the torus obtained from a fibered cylinder @xmath134 $ ] where the fibers are the lines @xmath135 $ ] , by identifying @xmath136 with @xmath137 for every @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath139 is given by a rotation by angle @xmath140 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "in addition to a standard choice of a meridian longitude basis for the homology of the boundary of a seifert torus , one can choose a basis of a fiber , and any simple closed curve on the boundary which intersects any fiber only once .",
    "such a curve is called a _ crossing curve_.    any fiber @xmath143 in a general seifert fiber space , has a neighborhood homeomorphic to some seifert torus , the homeomorphism taking @xmath143 to the central fiber .",
    "the type of the seifert torus is uniquely determined ( taking the invariants normalized as in the theorem ) and the fiber is called singular if @xmath144 . in a @xmath145 fibered torus ,",
    "any regular fiber @xmath143 is homeomorphic to @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the singular fiber .",
    "this will be used later to identify the invariants of specific seifert tori .    by identifying every fiber to a point one",
    "gets a map from any seifert fiber space @xmath61 to a two dimensional orbifold @xmath148 called the _",
    "orbit surface_. @xmath148 can not in general be embedded into @xmath61 .",
    "each cone point of @xmath148 corresponds to a singular fiber of the seifert fiber space .",
    "one can embed a subset of @xmath148 into @xmath61 in the following way .",
    "first , if @xmath61 and @xmath148 are closed , we remove a toral neighborhood of any regular fiber in @xmath61 , and the corresponding disk in @xmath148 , creating one boundary component @xmath149 for @xmath148 .",
    "then we remove a small neighborhood of each cone point of @xmath148 , obtaining the _ punctured orbit surface _ of @xmath61 we denote by @xmath150 . removing the corresponding toral neighborhoods of the singular fibers in @xmath61 , we get a three manifold @xmath151 which is a bundle over @xmath150 .",
    "seifert , @xcite , proves @xmath150 can always be embedded into @xmath151 , and the embedding is unique once the homology types of the boundary curves of @xmath150 on @xmath152 are determined .",
    "any closed seifert fiber space is uniquely determined by invariants \\{o /",
    "n , o / n , g , b ; ( _ 1,_1),,(_s,_s ) } , where one puts an @xmath153 if @xmath61 is orientable and @xmath154 if not , and @xmath155 if @xmath148 is orientable , @xmath14 if not .",
    "@xmath41 is the genus of @xmath148 , @xmath156 is the euler number of @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath157 is the number of the singular fibers , and a toral neighborhood of the singular fiber @xmath158 , @xmath159 is a seifert torus of type @xmath160 .",
    "given the invariants , the space @xmath61 can be constructed as follows .",
    "begin with a surface of genus @xmath41 with @xmath161 punctures .",
    "this is homeomorphic to @xmath150 .",
    "take the trivial circle bundle over @xmath150 , this is a fibered space with @xmath161 toral boundary components .",
    "the boundary curves of @xmath150 on each of the boundary tori of @xmath151 are crossing curves for these tori .",
    "so for each boundary torus this determines a basis of a crossing curve @xmath162 , @xmath159 , and a fiber @xmath143 .",
    "thus the invariants @xmath163 for each singular torus uniquely determine a gluing of this singular torus to @xmath151 such that fibers match .",
    "now there remains a single boundary component , with a given crossing curve @xmath164 .",
    "we glue in a @xmath165 fibered torus by gluing its meridian to a @xmath166 curve .    in the sequel",
    "we will consider open seifert fiber spaces , having a single toral boundary .",
    "as by gluing in a seifert torus one obtains a closed seifert fiber space , it follows from seifert s theorem that these manifolds are uniquely determined by the above invariants , excluding the euler number @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath156 remains undetermined as the parameter determining the gluing , and parametrizes the @xmath167 closed seifert fiber space into which the manifold can embed without adding singular fibers .    on each seifert fiber space",
    ", one can define an @xmath1 action , moving each point along the fiber containing it .",
    "consider the action on a neighborhood of a singular fiber , which is a @xmath131 fibered torus .",
    "take a meridional disk @xmath168 for this torus , thus the torus is given by @xmath169 $ ] with the identification by a @xmath140 rotation .",
    "choose a point @xmath170 on the meridian @xmath171 .",
    "there are @xmath132 intersection points of the orbit of @xmath170 ( i.e. the fiber containing @xmath170 ) with @xmath171 .",
    "we order these points as @xmath172 , by their order along the meridian .",
    "the flow takes @xmath173 along @xmath174 $ ] to a point @xmath175 identified under the rotation with @xmath176 .",
    "thus , by knowing the action one can derive both @xmath132 ( by the number of points in the orbit ) , and @xmath133 .",
    "this will be useful later on .",
    "the unit tangent bundle to @xmath83 is a seifert fiber space consisting of two seifert tori of invariants @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we divide the proof into several steps .",
    "step 1 : first we prove the unit tangent bundle is a union of two seifert tori . for this ,",
    "divide the orbifold itself into two disks , each a neighborhood of one of the cone points , so that they intersect along a line as in figure [ division ] .",
    "the unit tangent bundle to each of the disks is an @xmath1 bundle over the disk , i.e. , a fibered solid torus .",
    "it remains to prove that only one fiber in each torus is singular .",
    "for a two dimensional orbifold , a path making a small loop around a point together with the tangent direction at every point , is isotopic to the fiber corresponding to that point ( we orient both counter clockwise ) .",
    "any two small loops on the surface are regularly isotopic , unless one of them encloses a cone point , hence all fibers except at the cone points are isotopic and the torus contains at most one singular fiber , the one corresponding to the cone point .",
    "we denote the singular fiber corresponding to the @xmath14-cone point by @xmath179 and the one corresponding to the @xmath3-cone point by @xmath180 .    as in [ seifert",
    "] , such a torus is determined up to homeomorphism by two natural numbers @xmath145 , @xmath181 .",
    "denote the invariants of the torus which is the unit tangent bundle to a neighborhood of the @xmath14-cone point @xmath182 , and the invariants of the other torus by @xmath183 .",
    "we now compute these invariants in two further steps .",
    "step 2 : computing @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "consider the universal covering space of the orbifold .",
    "this is a @xmath186plane and in it any two loops are isotopic .",
    "hence , a lift of the singular fiber @xmath147 corresponding to the @xmath14-cone point ( which projects to the singular fiber to the order @xmath14 ) and a lift of any of the regular fibers @xmath143 are isotopic .",
    "thus in the projection , @xmath187 . in the same way , the @xmath89singular fiber to the @xmath188 order is isotopic to a regular fiber .",
    "hence as in [ seifert ] , the two unit tangent bundles to the cone points neighborhoods are two tori @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "step 3 : computing @xmath191 and @xmath192 . for the case",
    "@xmath193 which will be our main interest it is obvious that @xmath191 must equal 1 by the above normalization .",
    "it is actually true in general that both @xmath192 and @xmath191 equal 1 .",
    "we verify this following montesinos @xcite by considering the @xmath1 action on the unit tangent bundle as a seifert fiber space . for convenience ,",
    "we analyze the action while viewing the unit tangent bundle as the representation variety @xmath82 , as described below .    by definition ,",
    "the @xmath1 action consists of flowing along the fibers .",
    "the action on @xmath19 is given by rotating all pointers by a fixed angle while fixing their base points in @xmath16 . via the homeomorphism @xmath194 defined in section [ hutb ] ,",
    "the action of @xmath195 on @xmath42 is given by @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the rotation about @xmath90 by @xmath198 .",
    "the @xmath1 action in which we are interested on @xmath199 is the quotient of the action on @xmath19 .",
    "we next make use the homeomorphism @xmath94 described in [ representation_variety ] between @xmath199 and @xmath82 , @xmath200 .",
    "now , for @xmath201 choose @xmath31 such that @xmath202 .",
    "the @xmath1 action is thus given by @xmath203 .",
    "i.e. , the @xmath1 action is given by rotations of all lattices in @xmath82 about @xmath90 .",
    "the action takes @xmath88 back to itself for @xmath204 , while any lattice with a vertex very close to @xmath90 will return to itself only for @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 orbit of @xmath88 ( all lattices with a @xmath3-cone point at @xmath90 ) is the singular fiber of order @xmath3 .",
    "take a small neighborhood @xmath206 of @xmath90 in the plane ( containing no other vertices of @xmath88 ) .",
    "the set of lattice representations with a @xmath89cone point within @xmath206 is a toral neighborhood of the @xmath3-singular fiber .",
    "a meridional disk for this torus is the set of such lattices with ( say ) an upward direction ( pointing to the nearest neighbor ) , and the set of such lattices with a cone point and an upward direction on the circle @xmath207 is a meridian . fix a point @xmath208 on the meridian , and mark the @xmath3 points equally spaced along @xmath207 including @xmath170 by @xmath209 , ordered counterclockwise .",
    "the lattices corresponding to @xmath210 are in the same @xmath1 orbit , and it is the order in which they are transformed to one another which determines @xmath192 , as in [ seifert ] .",
    "the rotation by @xmath91 takes @xmath208 to @xmath211 .",
    "hence @xmath212 , and in the same manner @xmath213 .    concluding , the unit tangent bundle is the union of the seifert tori @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "there is of course some identification on the boundaries of these two tori .",
    "this identification is addressed in the following theorem .",
    "the unit tangent bundle of @xmath83 can be embedded in the lens space @xmath214 for any @xmath215 .",
    "consider again the two disks into which @xmath83 is divided in the previous proof , depicted in figure [ division ] .",
    "these disks intersect along a single ( open ) segment , denoted @xmath216 , included in each of their boundaries .",
    "the corresponding tori , which are the unit tangent bundles to each of the disks therefor each include the unit tangent bundle to @xmath216 on their boundaries .    by identifying the fibers lying above @xmath216 with one another ,",
    "one arrives at a gluing of the two tori @xmath177 and @xmath178 along an annulus .",
    "it is this gluing that yields the geometry of @xmath96 .",
    "the annulus is a union of regular fibers .",
    "the gluing must identify a regular fiber on one boundary torus to a regular fiber on the other boundary torus .",
    "this is true as the fiber above the same point on @xmath216 appears as a regular fiber in each of the boundaries .",
    "consider all orientation reversing homeomorphisms between the boundary tori .",
    "any such homeomorphism is given by matrix multiplication , by a matrix in @xmath217 with determinant @xmath218 .",
    "it is easy to compute that all such matrices satisfying that a @xmath178 curve is glued to a @xmath177 curve are m_n , k , c= (    cc kc-1 & n+k - nkc + c & 1-nc +    ) for any @xmath215 .",
    "two solid tori glued along their boundaries so that the meridian of one is glued to a @xmath129 curve on the other results in the lens space @xmath98 , as in section [ lens ] . hence the unit tangent bundle can be embedded into the @xmath167 lens spaces @xmath214 as required .",
    "@xmath96 can be embedded into @xmath0 if an only if @xmath219 , namely , for @xmath220 .",
    "first , the lens space @xmath98 is homeomorphic to @xmath0 if and only if @xmath221 .",
    "indeed , recall that @xmath222 , @xmath223 and for @xmath224 @xmath225 , ( see @xcite page 234 ) .",
    "thus the unit tangent bundle can be embedded into @xmath0 if and only if there exists an integer @xmath226 such that @xmath227 . by direct calculation",
    ", this can happen only for the case @xmath13 of the modular surface , or for orbifolds with less than two cone points .",
    "as adding more singular fibers can never result in @xmath0 , see @xcite , this proves the claim .",
    "our next goal is to obtain an homeomorphism from pointers on the orbifold into any of the relevant lens spaces computed above .",
    "we will now assume that @xmath193 , and we do this in two steps .",
    "the first consists of defining a particular vector field @xmath228 on the orbifold minus a neighborhood of the cone points ( in the present section ) .",
    "this gives an embedding of its domain , which is a pair of pants , into the unit tangent bundle .",
    "the second consists of completing this embedding to the different possible embeddings of @xmath96 into lens spaces ( in the two following sections ) .",
    "the completion is obtained by glueing in first the missing cone point neighborhoods , then glueing in the torus corresponding to the cusp .",
    "the last gluing can be done in @xmath167 different ways , according to the euler number of the resulting closed three manifold .",
    "we next define a vector field @xmath228 on the orbifold with some small neighborhoods of the cone points removed as in figure [ vector field ] : take the orbifold by a homeomorphism to the unit 2-sphere punctured at the north pole , taking the cusp to the north pole and the @xmath89cone point to the south pole .",
    "pull back the vector field pointing west at each point .",
    "this ca nt define a vector field on the orbifold including the neighborhood of the @xmath186cone point , as can be seen from figure [ vector field ] .",
    "thus the domain of the vector field is a pair of pants , which we denote by @xmath229 .     over @xmath230 , shown both on the orbifold and on a fundamental domain.,width=453 ]    another way of viewing the vector field",
    "@xmath228 is as the image of an embedding of @xmath229 into @xmath97 , taking each point of @xmath229 to the pointer based at this point , with the direction given by the vector field at this point .",
    "the embedding has the following properties :    1 .",
    "every fiber in the seifert fibration of @xmath97 intersects @xmath228 once , since each fiber consists of the circle of directions at a point , and @xmath228 chooses one of these directions .",
    "hence @xmath228 is a punctured orbit surface for the seifert fiber space @xmath97 , and in particular , its boundary curves @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 are crossing curves , i.e. cross each regular fiber on the boundary exactly once .",
    "2 .   as can be seen in figure [ vector field ]",
    ", one boundary component @xmath232 of @xmath228 is a small loop around the @xmath89cone point with its tangent vectors , hence is isotopic to the singular fiber @xmath180 .",
    "this means that on a torus which is the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of the @xmath89singular fiber , @xmath232 is homologous to a longitude + @xmath27 meridians for some @xmath234 .",
    "a regular fiber on this torus is a @xmath177 curve , and by property ( 1 ) , it intersects @xmath232 exactly once .",
    "thus , @xmath27 must be trivial and @xmath232 is simply isotopic to a longitude @xmath165 on this torus .",
    "this uniquely determines the way to glue in the ( k,1 ) singular torus , i.e. , determine the way to complete the embedding to the @xmath180 neighborhood .",
    "considering again figure [ vector field ] , the boundary component @xmath231 of @xmath228 is isotopic to a small loop around the @xmath186cone point with a direction rotating relative to its tangent vectors by one full rotation ( clockwise ) .",
    "hence , on the boundary torus of a tubular neighborhood of the @xmath186singular fiber , @xmath231 is homologous to a longitude @xmath165 minus a regular fiber ( which is a @xmath235 curve on this torus ) , plus some number of meridians .",
    "thus @xmath236 for some @xmath237 . as a together with property ( 1 )",
    "this yields @xmath231 is isotopic to either minus a longitude @xmath238 or a @xmath239 curve .",
    "the second option turns out to be the correct one , as will be computed below .",
    "the third boundary component @xmath233 of the surface is isotopic to a small loop around the cusp together with its tangent vectors .",
    "is a subset of @xmath97 homeomorphic to a pair of pants with boundaries as above.,width=188 ]      we now turn to the second step in explaining the embedding of @xmath97 into the lens spaces .",
    "this step consists of explicating the gluing of the missing tori . to begin with ,",
    "let us note the following conclusion from our previous discussion .",
    "all manifolds into which @xmath96 embeds without adding a singular fiber are the seifert fiber spaces m=\\{o , o,0|b;(k,1),(n,1 ) } ,  b    this follows since the pair of pants is orientable , unit tangent bundles are always orientable @xcite , @xmath96 has two singular fibers , and we computed the invariants @xmath177 and @xmath178 of the two singular tori .",
    "recall any gluing matrix @xmath240 determines an embedding into a specific lens space @xmath61 and @xmath61 can be computed directly from the matrix .",
    "we now relate the matrix to the euler number of @xmath61 .",
    "this will determine two things : which of the two possibilities for the coordinates of @xmath231 above is the correct one , enabling us to glue in the @xmath179 neighborhood ; and the relation between the parameter @xmath215 of the gluing matrix and the euler number @xmath241 of the lens space .",
    "the euler number @xmath156 is determined as follows .",
    "an abstract punctured orbit surface , in our case a pair of pants is taken together with its ( trivial ) unit tangent bundle .",
    "a fibered torus with the correct invariants is glued into two holes in the pants , so the boundary of the pair of pants is a crossing curve for these tori .",
    "these are the neighborhoods of the singular fibers . finally , to close the manifold a torus is glued into the third hole in the pair of pants , so that the meridian @xmath132 is glued to the curve @xmath242 where @xmath233 is the remaining boundary component of the pair of pants .    in our case",
    "@xmath233 is a crossing curve ( see section [ seifert ] ) , hence one can choose the longitude @xmath243 to be isotopic to a fiber @xmath143 .",
    "thus for @xmath61 with euler number @xmath156 , @xmath244 .    cut the pair of pants determined by the vector field along some curve @xmath245 connecting the @xmath233 boundary to the @xmath232 boundary component .",
    "then on one side of the path @xmath245 pull the surface into a stripe which then goes @xmath246 times in the direction of the fibers above @xmath245 , and then glued to the other side of @xmath245 .",
    "this takes @xmath247 to @xmath248 .",
    "this means that in the manifold @xmath61 one boundary component of the new pair of pants is a boundary of an embedded disk , by which one can remove that boundary component and arrive at an embedded annulus @xmath229 , with two boundaries : @xmath231 and @xmath249 .",
    "thus in @xmath61 @xmath231 can be isotoped to @xmath250 .",
    "the matrix @xmath251 computed before takes the curve @xmath252 in the @xmath235 torus to the curve (    c -1 + 0    ) + ( c-1 ) (    c k + 1    ) = -+(c-1)fin the @xmath177 torus .",
    "this decomposition can not be achieved with the other possible form for @xmath231 .",
    "this yields , = (    c -1 + -1    ) , b = c-1 , completing the embedding determined by @xmath228 .",
    "the complement of the image of the embeddings of @xmath96 into lens spaces discussed before is a solid fibered torus .",
    "this torus is a regular neighborhood of any one of its fibers , i.e .",
    ", the image of the unit tangent bundle is the complement of a regular fiber in the lens space .",
    "denote this fiber by @xmath253 . the missing fiber , or ` missing knot ' @xmath253 , plays the same role as the trefoil for the modular flow .",
    "we next make the embedding much more explicit : for any given pointer in @xmath96 we will be able to identify its image in the lens space .",
    "recall each of the relevant lens spaces are the union of a @xmath177 and a @xmath235 tori .",
    "take the @xmath177 torus to be a very small neighborhood of the singular fiber @xmath180 so that @xmath232 is on its boundary .",
    "it then follows that the @xmath235 torus contains the rest of @xmath96 , and in particular the vector field .",
    "we denote the @xmath235 torus by @xmath106 and take this torus to be oriented in the usual way , so that the orientation of the meridian followed by the orientation of the longitude gives the orientation of @xmath254 .",
    "the missing fiber @xmath253 corresponding to the cusp is then a regular fiber in the interior of this torus ( and not on its boundary as before ) .",
    "we determined the coordinates of the boundary curves @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 of the vector field . the coordinates are given each on the boundary tori which are the neighborhoods of @xmath179 , @xmath180 or @xmath253 .",
    "any two fixed boundary curves determine the pair of pants up to isotopy , see seifert @xcite page 44 .",
    "hence , it suffices that we identify one such pair of pants in the ( 2,1 ) torus , in order to identify @xmath228 .",
    "we now describe such a pair of pants for the case @xmath255 . for this case",
    "@xmath256 is a meridian and so when filling in @xmath132 with a disk one gets an annulus intersecting @xmath253 transversally .",
    "this corresponds to gluing the tori comprising the lens space by the matrix @xmath257 ( since @xmath258 ) .",
    "we represent the @xmath235 solid torus without a neighborhood of its core @xmath179 as a union of concentric tori .",
    "consider a @xmath239 curve on any one of these concentric tori .",
    "it intersects any @xmath235 fiber once . as we saw in  [ euler ] , @xmath231 is a @xmath239 curve , and hence there is an annulus connecting a @xmath239 curve @xmath245 on the inner boundary of the torus @xmath259 to @xmath231 , through @xmath239 curves on each of the concentric tori .",
    "the curve @xmath253 appears in @xmath259 as a @xmath235-curve on one of the concentric tori and therefore will intersect this annulus transversally at a point .",
    "thus , by puncturing the annulus at that point we arrive at the desired pair of pants .",
    "this follows from uniqueness since the punctured annulus has the desired boundaries @xmath231 and @xmath233 .",
    "it follows that the pair of pants also has @xmath232 as a boundary , and indeed , one can easily check that the @xmath257 matrix takes @xmath260 to @xmath232 :    (    cc k-1 & 2-k + 1 & -1 +    ) (    c 1 + 1 +    ) = (    c 1 + 0 +    ) = .    .,width=188 ]    we continue our analysis of the embedding ( which is determined up to isotopy ) from @xmath97 into the lens space , focusing on embedding the complement of small neighborhoods of the singular fibers into @xmath106 .    to begin with , our discussion in the previous section shows that the pair of pants described above ( and depicted in figure [ embedded_pair ] ) is the image of all pointers comprising the vector field .",
    "each pointer can be rotated by any angle while fixing its base point . by rotating all pointers of the vector field by the same angle at the same time we get an isotopy of the entire pair of pants @xmath228 . of course , when the angle is @xmath261 we retrieve @xmath228 once again , as in figure [ rotation_pair ] .",
    "naturally , the intermediate punctured orbit surfaces all have the same seifert invariants and thus are determined by @xmath239 curves .     .",
    "the curve marked @xmath262 is the boundary of the original vector field @xmath228 .",
    "every point travels along its fiber as one rotates the vector field counter clockwise , yielding the other pairs of pants.,width=188 ]    the set of these pairs of pants is determined up to isotopy .",
    "recall also that a counterclockwise rotation corresponds to flowing along the fibers in the positive direction .",
    "this yields a concrete mapping @xmath263 as desired , where @xmath198 is the angle relative to the vector field .",
    "[ bwthm ] given a flow @xmath70 on a three - manifold @xmath61 having a hyperbolic chain - recurrent set , the link of periodic orbits @xmath264 is in bijective correspondence with the link of periodic orbits @xmath265 on a particular embedded template @xmath266 . on any finite sublink ,",
    "this correspondence is via ambient isotopy .    in our case of geodesic flows on hyperbolic orbifolds , the chain recurrent set equals the recurrent set , and this set is the closure of the set of closed geodesics .",
    "the recurrent set in this case as the entire system is always hyperbolic due to the divergence of geodesics in @xmath16 : hyperbolicity means that transversal to the direction of the flow there is an expanding direction , and a contracting direction .",
    "these two directions are given by the horocycles , as explained in ",
    "[ geodesic_flows ] for the geodesic flow on the hyperbolic plane .",
    "since hyperbolicity is a local property , it descends to the quotients of the system , the flows on hyperbolic surfaces and orbifolds .",
    "therefore by theorem [ bwthm ] there exists a template for the flow on any hyperbolic orbifold .    the general method of obtaining a template consists of collapsing the stable manifolds of the system .",
    "thus one gets a semi - flow on two dimensional system , while all periodic orbits consist as different periodic orbits never belong to the same stable manifold .",
    "the problem is that in general the stable manifolds will be dense and collapsing them would result in a non - hausdorff space . very informally ,",
    "birman and williams overcome this by first `` separating '' the stable manifolds by preforming a surgery on one or two periodic orbits , reducing the dimension of the recuurent set to one , and then finding a nice neighborhood to this set in which the stable manifolds can indeed be neatly collapsed .",
    "this process is not constructive for a general flow , and thus obtaining templates for different flow is an interesting problem , and templates have been obtained for a limited number of flows .",
    "for hyperbolic geodesic flows the stable and unstable manifolds are known as in  [ geodesic_flows ] .",
    "we deal with the case of an orbifold with a cusp , for which the dimension of the basic set can always be reduced : by opening the cusp as in  [ representation_variety ]",
    "one arrives at system in which the set of periodic orbits is already not dense , and so the stable direction can simply be collapsed .",
    "ghys uses this fact to obtain the template for the modular surface , a further discussion of this matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus for our case there is a better understanding of obtaining the template .",
    "the details are described in the remaining of this section where we construct the templates for our examples .",
    "we now describe the embedded template in @xmath106 .",
    "following ghys @xcite , consider the @xmath3 fold cover of the fundamental domain of @xmath267 as in figure [ domain ] , denoted @xmath168 , where the generators of the group act by a rotation by @xmath268 about @xmath27 , and a rotation by @xmath75 about @xmath269 ( see  [ representation_variety ] .",
    "for every closed geodesic there is a lift passing through @xmath168 , crossing from some segment of @xmath270 to another . by using the rotational symmetry about @xmath269 ,",
    "any closed geodesic has a lift with an arc emanating from @xmath149 and crossing the domain . at the endpoints of the arc , where the lift leaves @xmath168 , we use again the rotation about @xmath269 and then the rotation about @xmath27 to identify each endpoint with a starting point of another arc .",
    "hence these arcs contain the recurrent set of the geodesic flow .",
    "we can choose the segment along the boundary of the fundamental domain ( depicted in figure [ branch_line ] ) with perpendicular direction vectors into the domain , as a single branch line for the template .",
    "for a general geodesic that is not necessarily perpendicular when entering the domain , we can always choose a different point along the stable manifold of the entry point of the geodesic , and arrive at a geodesic that is perpendicular at its entry point .",
    "recall the stable manifold is the horocycle corresponding to the starting point at infinity ( on @xmath149 ) of the geodesic , with the direction vectors perpendicular to the horocycle- pointing away from the starting point .",
    "if the geodesic is already perpendicular at the entry point , the horocycle and the boundary of the domain are tangent , and we do nothing .",
    "else , the horocycle crosses the boundary transversally and enters the domain .",
    "the horocycle returns to @xmath149 , and therefore must cross the boundary again at some other point . by looking at the geodesics perpendicular to the horocycle at each point between the two crossing points , we see the angle they create with the boundary changes monotonically , and must pass through @xmath271 . hence , by the mean value theorem there exists a point as required .",
    "thus , the chosen branch line contains a point of the equivalence class of every arc passing in @xmath168 , and so catches all the recurrent dynamics .    using the embedding derived in the previous section , we are able to embed the branch line in @xmath106 .",
    "one half of the branch line is contained in @xmath228 , while the other half in @xmath272 .",
    "hence , the branch line is embedded as shown in figure [ embedded_cores ] for the particular case @xmath15 .",
    "our template has @xmath273 stripes emanating from the branch line , each containing the arcs reaching the same segment @xmath274 at the endpoint .",
    "the stripes each return to the branch line by using the group symmetries as above .",
    "these stripes are called ears , and we denote the ear reachng @xmath274 by @xmath275 .",
    "each ear stretches across the entire branch line when returning to it , as any starting point can be obtained by the symmetries , from endpoints at any segment @xmath276 .",
    "denote the core of @xmath275 by @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath162 is the unique closed geodesic contained in the ear .    to understand the embedding of the template we have to understand the embedding of each core , and the twisting of the ear about its core .",
    "we begin with embedding the cores . to this end consider figure [ cores ] comparing the tangent vectors to each of the ear cores to the vector field @xmath228 .",
    "here we draw @xmath277 by taking the @xmath3-fold cover of @xmath228 as depicted in figure [ vector field ] .",
    "now , by considering at the same time this figure and figure [ rotation_pair ] , this yields the embedding of the cores into @xmath106 .",
    "together with the branch line , this is sketched for the case @xmath15 in figure [ embedded_cores ] . for obtaining this figure , the cores @xmath278 and @xmath279 ( and in general @xmath280 )",
    "are easy do identify as small loops around the missing fiber @xmath253 , as on the orbifold they are small loops around the cusp , and they are contained in @xmath228 and @xmath281 respectively by figure [ cores ] .",
    "the next two cores can be understood as they follow loops further from the cusp , then around the 2-cone point , then again around the cusp , while traveling back and forth through the different pairs of pants , as their angle relative to @xmath228 increases , then decreases , and vice versa , as in figure [ cores ] .",
    "this is enough for understanding the four cores of the @xmath15 case , given in figure [ embedded_cores ] , or for these four loops in ane @xmath282 template , @xmath283 .",
    "we now consider the next ears in a general @xmath282 template .",
    "the four first ear cores for any flow on @xmath230 for @xmath284 is given in figure [ next_cores ] .",
    "we note two facts regarding these cores .",
    "each subsequent core reaches a larger angle relative to the vector field before returning back to the vector field direction .",
    "the core corresponding to the ear @xmath285 has @xmath286 parts each isotopic to @xmath232 , that is a circle around the @xmath3-cone points , and each subsequent core is closer to the @xmath232 curve .",
    "these four first loops for any @xmath3 are sketched , by the same method as for the to first ( and last ) ears above , in figure [ four_loops ] .",
    "we next compute for each ear the embedding of one orbit in addition to the core .",
    "this will determine the twists of each ear , and thus the template .",
    "a second orbit in the same ear is never closed , and so will have two parts .",
    "the first part is a geodesic segment : we choose a geodesic which emanetes from the branchline perpendicularly to the boundary of the domain , very close to the closed geodesic , closer to the 2-cone point along the branch line . for this segment for any of the ears ,",
    "we find it reaches a larger angle than the core relative to the vector field before returning to it , and is closer than the core to @xmath232 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ first_loop ] for the first ear .",
    "this means , this segment is in the direction of the next core ( if it exists ) , and we can draw this segment it @xmath259 according to our embedding of the cores above .    when the above geodesic segment reaches again the boundary of the fundamental domain as on figure [ branch_line ] , its direction is not perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "this means that in the unit tangent bundle this geodesic arc did not return to the branch line .",
    "the second part of the orbit will connect it to the branch line through segments of stable manifolds and geodesic segments , as explained above in general . in this case , by choosing a segment close enough to the closed geodesic , the second step can be done in one `` move '' .",
    "this is sketched in figure [ first_loop ] for the first ear .",
    "this is the last ingredient needed for determining the template completely , and is then done for each of the template ears .",
    "the resulting template is sketched in figure [ embedded_template ] for the @xmath15 case .",
    "note that the linking number of any closed geodesic with the missing knot @xmath253 is well defined in any of the lens spaces , and can be easily read off the sequence of ears of the template the geodesic passes through .",
    "we next analyze the structure of the template for a larger @xmath3 .",
    "the four loops in figure [ four_loops ] can be isotoped to yield figure [ four_loops_isotoped ] .",
    "it is obvious that this is similar for the four last ears by the symmetry , and that this generalizes to the next ears .",
    "it is true for all ears that for a second orbit starting closer to the middle of the branch line , the maximal angle from the vector field increases , while the image approaches @xmath232 .",
    "the number of times the geodesic encircles the @xmath3-cone point increases by one when passing from one ear to the next .",
    "thus , when one executes the same analysis for the twisting of the ears as in the @xmath15 case by examining one more loop in each ear , one finds the additional ears can also be put one beside the other exactly as in figure [ four_loops_isotoped ] .",
    "the last crucial step in our analysis is to glue the ears together along their boundaries , where they run parallel to each other . in this way",
    "we obtain a template with a smaller number of ears , that actually does not increase with @xmath3 .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ four_loops_isotoped ] , we have to add another branch line in the middle of the first loop , and the same is of course true for the last loop , as in figure [ unified_template ] .    for each of the three branch lines we now have two ears arriving to it , but it is true only for the middle one that both ears cover it completely .",
    "we now address this last fact .",
    "any ear @xmath275 in any of the original templates we constructed above , starts at the central branch line , arrives at one of the side branch lines and then makes some travels along the core of @xmath259 ( through one of the long ears in figure [ unified_template ] .",
    "the number of the travels through the long ear equals @xmath287 if @xmath288 , and @xmath289 otherwise .",
    "the @xmath90-th ear then passes to the shorter ear emanating from the side branch line to arrive back at the central branch line .",
    "hence , the longer ears in the @xmath282 template covers itself only partly when it comes back to the branch line , so that the maximal number of times an orbit can pass through it without arriving back at the central branch line is @xmath290 .",
    "thus , we find all @xmath282 templates , with @xmath283 are in fact very similar , the only change being the length of the two smaller branch lines which is covered by the longer ear . if one insists on having every incoming ear covering the entire branch line in the definition of a template , one is led to propagate forwards the end point of the long ear , from the branch line forward through the same ear .",
    "this has to be done recursively a number of times , and will result in a template very similar to the original template we obtain for the @xmath282 case , with a number of ears increasing with @xmath3 . in any case",
