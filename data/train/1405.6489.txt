    "<S> a major puzzle in biology is how mammalian sperm determine and maintain the correct swimming direction during the various phases of the sexual reproduction process . whilst chemotaxis is assumed to dominate in the immediate vicinity of the ovum </S>",
    "<S> , it is unclear which biochemical or physical cues guide spermatozoa on their long journey towards the egg cell . </S>",
    "<S> currently debated mechanisms range from peristaltic pumping to temperature sensing ( thermotaxis ) and direct response to fluid flow variations ( rheotaxis ) , but little is known quantitatively about their relative importance . here , we report the first quantitative experimental study of mammalian sperm rheotaxis . using microfluidic devices , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate systematically the swimming behavior of human and bull sperm over the whole range of physiologically relevant shear rates and viscosities . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements show that the interplay of fluid shear , steric surface - interactions and chirality of the flagellar beat leads to a stable upstream spiraling motion of sperm cells , thus providing a generic and robust rectification mechanism to support mammalian fertilisation . </S>",
    "<S> to rationalise these findings , we identify a minimal mathematical model that is capable of describing quantitatively the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> the combined experimental and theoretical evidence supports the hypothesis that the shape and beat patterns of mammalian sperm cells have evolved to optimally exploit rheotaxis for long - distance navigation .    the authors declare no competing interests .

    "<S> have to find and maintain the right swimming direction over distances that may exceed their head - to - tail length   by a thousandfold . on their path to the egg cell , </S>",
    "<S> mammalian sperm encounter varied physiological environments , are exposed to a variety of chemical gradients and must overcome counter - flows . whilst chemotactic sensing  @xcite is assumed to provide important guidance in the immediate vicinity of the ovum  @xcite , it is not known which biochemical  @xcite or physical mechanisms  @xcite keep the sperm cells on track as they pass through the rugged landscapes of cervix , uterus and oviduct   @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the mammalian reproduction process and not least the lack of quantitative data make it very difficult to assess the relative importance of the various proposed long - distance navigation mechanisms  @xcite , ranging from cervix contractions  @xcite and chemotaxis  @xcite to thermotaxis  @xcite and rheotaxis  @xcite . aiming to understand not only qualitatively but also quantitatively how fluid - mechanical effects may help steer mammalian spermatozoa over large distances , we report here a combined experimental and theoretical study of sperm swimming in microfluidic channels , probing a wide range of physiologically relevant conditions of shear and viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> for both human and bull spermatozoa , we find that their physical response to shear flow , combined with an effective shape - regulated surface attraction  @xcite and head - tail counter - precession , favors an upstream spiraling motion along channel walls . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of this fluid - mechanical rectification mechanism suggests that it is likely to play a key role in the long - distance navigation of mammalian sperm cells . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the detailed analysis reported below not only yields new quantitative insights into the role of biophysical processes during mammalian reproduction but could also lead to new diagnostic tools and improved artificial insemination techniques  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments on red abalone  @xcite , a large marine snail that fertilises externally , showed that weak fluid flows can be beneficial to the reproduction of these organisms , suggesting that shear flows could have acted as a selective pressure in gamete evolution . in higher organisms , which typically fertilise internally , </S>",
    "<S> sperm transport is much more complex and the importance of shear flows relative to chemotaxis , peristaltic pumping or thermotaxis still poses an open problem as it is difficult to perform well - controlled  _ in vivo _ studies . </S>",
    "<S> the complex uterine and oviduct topography  @xcite and large traveling distances render it unlikely that local chemotactic gradients steer sperm cells during the initial and intermediate stages of the sexual reproduction process . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence  @xcite suggests that rapid sperm transport right after insemination is supported by peristaltic pumping driven by muscular contractions of the uterus , but it is not known how sperm navigate in the oviduct . </S>",
    "<S> thermotaxis , the directed response of sperm to local temperature differences , was proposed as a possible long - range rectification mechanism of sperm swimming in rabbits  @xcite , but recently questioned  @xcite as it is likely to be inhibited by convective currents that form in the presence of temperature gradients . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it has long been known that , similar to bacteria  @xcite and algae  @xcite , mammalian sperm  @xcite are capable of performing rheotaxis , by aligning against a surrounding flow  @xcite , but this effect has yet to be systematically quantified in experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , it is not known at present how sperm cells respond to variations in shear rate and viscosity , and how long they need to adapt to temporal changes in the flow direction . </S>",
    "<S> answering these questions is essential for understanding which physical effects may be important at different stages of the mammalian fertilisation process .    to quantify the swimming strategies of sperm cells under well - controlled flow conditions </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a series of microfluidic experiments in cylindrical and planar channels ( fig .  1 ) , varying systematically shear rates @xmath0 and viscosities @xmath1 through the physiologically and rheotactically relevant regime , up to @xmath2mpa@xmath3s which is roughly @xmath4 the viscosity of natural seminal fluid  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements revealed the interesting result that both human and bull spermatozoa do not simply align against the flow , but instead swim upstream on spiral - shaped trajectories along the walls of a cylindrical channel ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a and movie  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the previously unrecognised transversal velocity component can be attributed to the chirality of the flagellar beat . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting helical swimming patterns enable the spermatozoa to explore collectively the full surface of a cylindrical channel , suggesting that rheotaxis can help sperm to navigate their way through the oviduct and find the egg cell  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using high - speed imaging , we also determined the dynamical response of human and bull spermatozoa to flow reversal at different viscosities , which is essential for understanding how active swimming , rheotaxis and uterine peristalsis can combine to facilitate optimal sperm transport . </S>",
    "<S> to rationalise the experimental observations , we identify below a simple mathematical model that reproduces the main results of our measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]      in the experiments , samples of human and bull spermatozoa were injected into microfluidic channels of spherical or rectangular cross - section ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cells were then exposed to well - defined poiseuille shear flows , corresponding to parabolic flow profiles ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . even in the absence of flow , </S>",
    "<S> sperm cells tend to accummulate at surfaces  @xcite due to a combination of steric repulsion  @xcite and hydrodynamic forces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the fact that , in essence , the flagellar beat traces out a cone which , upon collision , aligns with a solid surface , so that the sperm s propulsion vector points into the boundary and the cells become effectively trapped at the surface  @xcite . in the presence of a poiseuille shear flow , cells close to the channel boundaries experience an approximately linear vertical flow profile , whose slope is given by the shear rate  @xmath5 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> to quantify the effects of shear rate and viscosity on sperm swimming , we tracked a large number of individual cells ( typically @xmath6 ) in planar microfluidic channels ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) at different shear rates @xmath5 , ranging from 0.2 s@xmath7 to 9 s@xmath7 , and different dynamic viscosities @xmath1 , ranging from 1mpa@xmath3s ( that of water ) to 20mpa@xmath3s ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cell tracks were then used to reconstruct the velocities of sperm swimming close to the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> mean values and histograms of the upstream and transverse velocity components from those measurements are summarised in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d , e . </S>",
    "<S> since sperm motility depends on viscosity and may vary among different samples , it is advisable to normalise sperm velocities @xmath8 , that have been measured at different values of @xmath5 and @xmath1 , by the mean sample speed @xmath9 at zero shear @xmath10 , and also to rescale the flow velocity accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> figure  1d shows the thus - normalised mean upstream and mean transverse swimming velocities @xmath11 for bull and human spermatozoa as a function of the dimensionless rescaled shear flow speed @xmath12 , where @xmath13 m is the approximate amplitude of a typical flagellar beat ( i.e. the maximum distance of the flagellar tip from the surface during a beat is @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the upstream velocity reveal that both human and bull sperm exhibit optimal upstream swimming at rescaled flow speeds @xmath15 , implying that there is an optimal shear regime for the rectification of sperm swimming . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , however , we also find that , at low viscosities ( @xmath1610mpa@xmath3s ) , human spermatozoa exhibit a substantial shear - induced transverse velocity component that becomes suppressed at very high viscosities . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , for bull spermatozoa , the mean transverse component is generally weaker and less sensitive to viscosity variations . </S>",
    "<S> these statements are also corroborated by the corresponding velocity histograms in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e .    </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the above observations for stationary shear flows can be explained as follows . </S>",
    "<S> once a sperm cell has become trapped at a surface , its tail explores , on average , regions of higher flow velocity than the head , resulting in a net torque that turns the head against the flow ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shear - induced rectification is counter - acted by variability in the cells swimming direction . </S>",
    "<S> if the shear velocity is too low the orientational noise , which is caused by a combination of intrinsic fluctuations in the cells swimming apparatus , thermal fluctuations and elastohydrodynamic effects , inhibits upstream swimming , whereas if the shear velocity becomes too large the sperm will simply be advected downstream by the flow , implying that there exists an optimal intermediate shear rate for upstream swimming . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that the maximum of the upstream velocity decreases more strongly with viscosity for bull sperm than for human sperm ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this could be due to differences in cell morphology , as previous numerical studies  @xcite for bacterial cells suggest that differences in head shape can substantially alter swimming behavior . </S>",
    "<S> bull sperm have a flatter head than human sperm , which likely suppresses the rotational motion of the cell at high viscosities thus leading to an effectively smaller vertical beat amplitude  @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this could explain why , at high values of @xmath1 , the tail beat of bull sperm becomes essentially two - dimensional and constricted to the vicinity of the surface , so that alignment against the flow becomes less efficient .    to understand the unexpectedly strong transverse velocity component of human sperm at @xmath18mpa@xmath3s , as typical of the seminal fluid  @xcite , it is important to recall that sperm of invertebrae and mammals are known to exhibit different chiral beat patterns depending on environmental conditions  @xcite , and that shear flows are capable of separating particles along the transverse direction according to their chirality  @xcite . human sperm exhibit a strongly helical beat component at low - to - moderate values of @xmath1 ( movie 2 ) , but this chirality becomes suppressed at high viscosities  ( movie  3 ) resulting in more planar wave forms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the beat of a bull sperm flagellum is more similar to a rigidly rotating planar wave even at low viscosities  ( movie 4 ) , thus exhibiting a weaker chirality and leading to smaller transverse velocities  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the flagellar beating pattern can be controlled not only by viscosity but also by changes in calcium concentration  @xcite , higher organisms appear to possess several means for tuning transverse and upstream swimming of sperm .      </S>",
    "<S> in addition to typically outward directed mucus flow in the oviduct , sperm cells are also exposed to temporally varying flows driven by uterine contractions  @xcite . to probe the dynamical response of sperm to changes in the flow direction </S>",
    "<S> , we performed additional experiments where we tracked the motion of bull and human spermatozoa after a sudden flow reversal at two different viscosities ( fig .  2 and movies  5 , 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in those experiment , sperm were first given time to align against a stationary shear flow , then the flow direction was reversed , @xmath19 , with a switching time @xmath20s . upon flow reversal , </S>",
    "<S> a sperm cell typically performs a u - turn ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic radius of curvature of the trajectory and the typical turning time @xmath21 were found to increase strongly with viscosity . at low viscosity , @xmath22mpa@xmath3s , </S>",
    "<S> sperm realign rapidly against the new flow direction with a typical response time of @xmath23s to 10s , and the curvature radius is of the order of one or two sperm lengths @xmath24 m ( movie  5 ) . by contrast , at a larger viscosity of @xmath25mpa@xmath3s , which is roughly @xmath26 higher than the natural viscosity of the ejaculate , both curvature radius and response time increase by approximately a factor of @xmath27 ( movie  6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these response times are of the order of typical cervical contractions  @xcite , suggesting a possible fine - tuning between muscular activity of the uterus and turning behavior of sperm cells . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , immediately after the flow reversal , sperm orientation and flow direction point for a short period of time in approximately the same direction , leading to a momentarily increased transport velocity ( see velocity peaks in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by switching flow directions back and forth at an optimal rate , the transport efficiency of an initially rectified sperm population can be enhanced .      to test whether our understanding of the experimental observations is correct and to provide a basis for future theoretical studies , we used resistive force theory to infer a minimal mathematical model that incorporates the main physical mechanisms discussed above ( details are provided in the supplementary file 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model assumes that the effectively two - dimensional motion of a sperm cell , that swims close to a surface in the presence of a shear flow can be described in terms of its position vector @xmath28 and its orientation unit vector @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> focussing on an effective description of the main physical effects and assuming that the flow is in @xmath30-direction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) , the equations of motions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 read @xmath33 equation  ( 1 ) states that the net in - plane velocity @xmath34 of a cell arises from two main contributions : self - swimming at typical speed @xmath35 in the direction of the cell orientation @xmath32 , and advection by the flow , where @xmath36 defines the flow direction and @xmath37 the mean flow speed experienced by the cell . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in detail in the supplementary file 1 , the nonlinear structure of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) ensures that the length of the orientation vector @xmath32 remains conserved , assuming that the change in orientation , @xmath38 , is caused by three effects : shear - induced alignment against the flow with rate @xmath39 where @xmath40 is numerical factor that encodes geometry of the flagellar beat , shear - and - chirality - induced turning at rate @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 encoding chirality and shape of the flagellar beat , and variability  @xcite in the swimming direction , modeled as a stratonovich - type two - dimensional gaussian white noise @xmath44 with amplitude @xmath45  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equations  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) were obtained by approximating the flagellum by a rigid conical helix , with the polar geometry of the enveloping cone dictating the mathematical structure of the deterministic turning terms ( see supplementary file 1 for details of the calculation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplifying assumptions underlying eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) imply that this minimal model does not accurately capture the dynamics of individual cells at zero shear , as the deterministic terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) neglect the intrinsic curvature of cell trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> however , when analyzing the in - plane curvature for a large number of human sperm trajectories ( @xmath46100,000 sample points from more than 1200 cells ) at zero shear , we found a broad distribution of curvatures with a small positive mean curvature of @xmath47m@xmath7 at low viscosity ( 1mpa@xmath3s ) and a small negative mean curvature @xmath48m@xmath7 at high viscosity ( 12mpa@xmath3s ) , where the different signs are consistent with the observed change in the transverse velocity for human sperm at high viscosity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . to account at least partially for these curvature variations , we include in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the gaussian white noise term . compared with more accurate models that resolve the details of the flagellar dynamics  @xcite , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] ) provide a strongly reduced description which , however , turns out be sufficient for rationalising our experimental observations ( fig .  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> values for @xmath35 and @xmath49 can be directly estimated from experiments , and sign conventions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) have been chosen such that @xmath50 for human sperm at low viscosity ( for weakly chiral bull sperm one can use @xmath51 in a first approximation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters @xmath52 can be inferred from the experimental data ( supplementary file 1 ) . by performing systematic parameter scans , we found that values @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55\\,$]rad@xmath56/s yield good quantitative agreement with the experimental results for both stationary flow ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) and flow reversal ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) , suggesting that the coupling between shear flow and beat chirality dominates the transverse velocity dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we may therefore conclude that , despite some strong simplifications , the effects included in the model capture indeed the main physical mechanisms relevant for understanding sperm motion in shear flow near a surface .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ]    in conclusion , we have reported detailed quantitative measurements of sperm motion in shear flow . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results show that upstream swimming of mammalian sperm due to rheotaxis is more complex than previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> human sperm cells were found to exhibit a significant transverse velocity component that could be of relevance in the fertilisation process , as the ensuing spiraling motion enables spermatozoa to explore collectively a larger surface area of the oviducts , thereby increasing the probability of locating egg cells . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis implies that the transverse velocity component arises from a preferred handedness in the flagella beat in the presence of shear flow , in contrast to recent findings for male microgametes of the malaria parasite  _ plasmodium berghei _  @xcite . due to the large sample size , </S>",
    "<S> our data provide substantial statistical evidence for the hypothesis that mammalian sperm have evolved to achieve optimal upstream swimming near surfaces , possibly exploiting the enhanced fluid production in the female reproductive system during the fertile phase  @xcite and after intercourse  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the improved quantitative knowledge derived from this data may help to design more efficient artificial insemination strategies , for example , by optimising the viscosity and chemical composition of fertilisation media and adjusting injection techniques to maximise upstream swimming of sperm cells . </S>",
    "<S> combined with recent measurements  @xcite , which clarified the importance of flagella - mediated contact interactions for the accumulation of sperm cells at surfaces , the results presented here yield a cohesive picture of the mechanistic and fluid - mechanical  @xcite aspects of long - distance sperm navigation . </S>",
