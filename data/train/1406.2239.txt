    "some of these compounds are believed to be responsible for degradation of properties @xcite .",
    "housseau _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on the effective diffusion coefficients values calculated from their experimental permeation tests , have demonstrated that these undesirable phases have not influence on the mobility of @xmath10 in @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "bierlin and green @xcite have reported the activation energy values of @xmath10 mobility in @xmath4 , based on the maximum rate of penetration of @xmath10 into @xmath4 .",

    "therefore it is important to study carefully and with special attention the initial microscopic processes that originate these intermetallic phases . in order to deal with this problem we started studying numerically the static and dynamic properties of vacancies and interstitials defects in the @xmath4(@xmath10 ) bulk and in the neighborhood of a @xmath15 interface using molecular dynamics calculations @xcite . here",
    ", we review our previous works @xcite , performing calculation of the tracer diffusion coefficients in binary @xmath0 and @xmath1 alloys , using analytical expressions of the diffusion parameters in terms of microscopical magnitudes .    we have summarized the theoretical tools needed to express the diffusion coefficients in terms of microscopic magnitudes such as , the jump frequencies , the free vacancy formation energy and the vacancy - solute binding energy .",

    "the five frequency model has also been of great utility in order to discriminate the relevant jump frequencies , evaluated from the migration barriers under the harmonic approximation in the context of the conventional treatment by vineyard corresponding to the classical limit .",
    "hence , we have calculated the full set of phenomenological coefficients from which the full set of diffusion coefficients are obtained through the flux equation .    in this respect ,",
    "the jump frequencies have been calculated from the migration barriers which are obtained with an economic static molecular techniques ( cmst ) namely the monomer method , that searches saddle configurations efficiently .",
    "although in this work we have performed the treatment for the case of f.c.c .",
    "latices where the diffusion is mediated by vacancy mechanism , a similar procedure can be adopted for other crystalline structures or different diffusion mechanism ( for example , interstitials ) .",
    "we have exemplified our calculations for the particular cases of diluted @xmath0 and @xmath1 f.c.c . binary alloys .",
    "we have found that the tracer diffusion coefficient are in very good agreement with the available experimental data , for both alloys .",
    "present calculations show that qualitatively a vacancy drag mechanism is unlikely to occur for the @xmath0 system . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "a vacancy drag mechanism could occur at temperatures below @xmath2k , while above this temperature the solute migrates by a direct interchange mechanism with the vacancy , such as was corroborated in the comparison with the available experimental data .",
    "we have demonstrated that , the cmst is appropriate in order to describe the impurity diffusion behavior mediated by a vacancy mechanism in f.c.c .",
    "this opens the door for future works in the same direction where a similar procedure will be used that includes interstitial defects .",
