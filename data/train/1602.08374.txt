    "in present urbanism the idea that cities are mostly and essentially condenser of social and economic activities is popularly associated with jane jacobs call for more compact urban environments around socially inclusive open spaces @xcite .",
    "it is today well known that cities emerge and grow because density pays off , and does that at a pace that largely off - sets that of its negatives @xcite .",
    "the first step in understanding cities is therefore examining why activities are concentrated in a few places .",
    "certain activities in fact exhibit an increasing return - to - scale , meaning that they profit proportionally more , or cost proportionally less , than the spatial growth of the city , and this is regarded as the driving force behind the growth of cities @xcite .",
    "however , what makes cities great in expanding the benefit of concentration is not just the economy of scale per se , but that whatever you do occurs in a place where a number of other things also occur nearby at the same time .",
    "those nearby activities may belong to the same industry ( _ localization economies _ ) or to a variety of different industries ( _ urbanization economies _ ) .",
    "understanding whether localization or urbanization economies are the reason why cities grow , and under what circumstances , is obviously very important to determine policies towards increasing specialization or rather , on the other hand , increasing heterogeneity .",
    "economic activities and the way they tend to locate in cities have been investigated from the point of view of spatial economics , looking at the equilibrium in space between factors like customers , suppliers and transport costs that would determine the optimal location of activities ; this stream of studies , that draws back to classics written as early as in the late xixth - early xxth century @xcite , has paved the way for an intense post - war period of progressive regional and urban analysis @xcite , which now struggles to make its way into a globalized world dominated by uncertainty , expanding urban poverty and the increasing fragmentation of decision making systems , including urban planning systems .",
    "a more recent area of scientific investigation of urban economics has shifted the focus from business and employment only to retail , acknowledging the fundamental role of the sector in processes of urbanization and taking advantage of new potentials in geographic information systems ( gis ) modeling @xcite .",
    "this stream of research refers directly to studies in marketing and business organization , largely a response to industry s quest to develop scientific models of geo - located advantage with regards to potential market , closest competitors and other purely business management factors .",
    "most importantly , this literature has grown on previous investigations of patterns of retail agglomeration that looked at retail diversification and at spatial features influencing rejection and attraction between categories of outlets @xcite . in this context",
    ", the diversification of retail activities in an urban area is considered as an important aspect of the social `` attractiveness '' of a city , and it is becoming nowadays subject of detailed investigation.@xcite .    today , it is possible to study the location and diversity of commercial activities in large real - world urban systems , by making use of advanced gis techniques and even mobile phone or geo - located online social networks @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the recent progress in studying cities as spatial networks @xcite , a quantitative analysis of the historical development of the distribution of activities in a city is still missing , mainly because of the difficulties in getting historical data in electronic format . building on a unique database , in this work we contribute a first empirical study of the development of retail activities in a city in time , by looking at the type and date of birth of all the activities present at year 2004 along with their geographical position .",
    "specifically , the data set we have analysed contains the exact position in space ( location ) , the year of registration and the market category ( type ) of each of the @xmath0 commercial activities present in the city of rome ( italy ) at the year 2004 .",
    "notice that , since the first activity was registered on the @xmath1 of january 1900 , while the last one on the @xmath1 of july 2004 , the entire data set covers a period of more than a century .",
    "however , in our study we do not have complete information on the whole set of activities present in rome at a certain time @xmath2 , but only on those activities present at time @xmath2 which survived up to year 2004 . in short , of all activities that have populated the city of rome in the analysis period",
    ", our data set only refers to the  survivors \" at 2004 , and we look backward to their behaviors in time as associated to their type and location .",
    "each activity in fact belongs to one of eight commercial categories ( or types ) . in table",
    "[ t : categories ] we report a list of the categories together with the number of activities @xmath3 of each type @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    ".number @xmath3 of commercial activities of type @xmath4 in rome at year 2004 [ cols=\"^ , < , > \" , ]     [ t : changes ]    fig .",
    "[ f : ar_jc ] also shows a slightly tendency towards the reduction of the value of @xmath6 in time , and its stabilization to a relatively low value .",
    "in fact , the commercial activities start to become more evenly distributed in the territory , and only a weak coexistence or repulsion of different categories can be registered .",
    "this behaviour can not be attributed to the increase of the number of activities , because , as visible in fig .",
    "[ f : h ] , the density of activities is approximately constant in time and the small variations observed in the density do not affect the values of attractiveness .",
    "in this paper we investigate location and type of all the 35,000 retail activities present in the city of rome in 2004 , along with their development in time over approximately one century , from 1900 to 2004 .",
    "the aim of the study is to shed some light on the temporal dynamics of retail as one of the most fundamental drivers of urbanization .    in order to do so ,",
    "we first look at the number of activities both in terms of registrations and cumulative presence year - by - year . we notice that while activities restlessly grow over the whole period , they do so at two very different speeds , with a marked change in speed emerging in the middle of the seventies .",
    "this change immediately follows the first oil crisis , with `` repair '' and  medicals \" being the only two types of activities that do not show any drop in registrations during the crisis .",
    "this tells the story of an abrupt shift in the conditions of the local market from a state of expansion to one of stagnation subsequent to global political moves .",
    "we then look at the diversity of retail types first globally , i.e. the overall contribution of each type to the whole retail stock present in 2004 year by year over the period , and locally , i.e. their contribution year by year to the stock located in each square cell of 350 meters of edge of a virtual grid covering the whole city of rome .",
    "we find that while the number of activities grows with time , their diversity manifests a threefold global behaviour : it grows in the years of the post - war reconstruction and expansion , remains quite stable after the sixties for about three decades , and decreases in the last decade .",
    "locally , however , we see a different scenario , where on one hand the higher diversity of retail activities occurs where their spatial concentration is higher , while on the other there does not appear to be any visible plafond to the local growth of retail diversity .",
    "the observed difference in the global and local organisation of activities , with the diversity of activity types continuing steadily to grow locally in a condition of global stability , can be of great importance in understanding the capacity of cities to find smaller scale forms of organisation that would normally go unnoticed .",

    "<S> understanding urban growth is one with understanding how society evolves to satisfy the needs of its individuals in sharing a common space and adapting to the territory . we propose here a quantitative analysis of the historical development of a large urban area by investigating the spatial distribution and the age of commercial activities in the whole city of rome . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the age of activities of various categories presents a very interesting double exponential trend , with a transition possibly related to the long - term economical effects determined by the oil crisis of the seventies . </S>",
    "<S> the diversification of commercial categories , studied through various measures of entropy , shows , among other interesting features , a saturating behaviour with the density of activities . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , different couples of commercial categories exhibit over the years a tendency to attract in space . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the spatio - temporal distribution of commercial activities can provide important insights on the urbanisation processes at work , revealing specific and not trivial socio - economical dynamics , as the presence of crisis periods and expansion trends , and contributing to the characterisation of the maturity of urban areas . </S>"
