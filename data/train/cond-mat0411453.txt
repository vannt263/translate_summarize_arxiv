    "such a replacement however does not hold for other thermodynamic functions and constant volume anharmonic effects have to be explicitly computed by diagrammatic perturbative methods @xcite .",
    "as at high temperatures phonon - phonon anharmonicities are large , in the intermediate to low temperature range the _ e - ph _ coupling strength may induce the dominant anharmonic effects in the phonon subsystem , the latter being dependent on the peculiarities of the _ e - ph _ model hamiltonian .",
    "the holstein hamiltonian @xcite and the su - schriffer - heeger hamiltonian @xcite have been widely investigated in the last decades also in view of the growing interest for polaronic mechanisms in high @xmath2 superconductors @xcite and polymers @xcite .",
    "while the holstein model assumes a local coupling of tight binding electrons to optical phonons , in the ssh model the electron - phonon interaction modifies the electron hopping matrix elements thus leading to a non - local ( in momentum space ) coupling with vertex function dependent on both the electron and the phonon wave vector @xcite . as the ground state of the ssh hamiltonian",

    "the effects of the phonon spectrum renormalization on the polaron scattering have been studied both for the optical @xcite and the acoustical @xcite branches .",
    "phonon anharmonicities have been also proposed as a fundamental feature favouring high @xmath2 superconductivity in the context of ( bi)polaronic theories @xcite .    when the electron energy scale , set by the value of the tight binding overlap integral , is larger of ( or comparable to ) the characteristic phonon energy the lattice deformation does not follow instantaneously the electron motion @xcite and the _ e - ph _ interaction becomes time dependent .",
    "the path integral formalism @xcite is suitable to account for time dependent interactions as a retarded potential naturally emerges in the exact integral action @xcite .",
    "moreover , being valid for any _ e - ph _ coupling value , the path integral method allows one to derive the partition function and the related temperature derivatives without those limitations which affect the perturbative studies .",

    "we propose a comparative analysis of the equilibrium thermodynamics for the phonon system in the holstein and ssh models pointing out the appearance of macroscopic anharmonic features driven by the strength of the _ e - ph _ coupling . in section",

    "the non - interacting phonon hamiltonian @xmath18 is assumed to be given , in both models , by a set of independent oscillators .",
    "taking @xmath19 as the characteristic phonon energy , the displacement field can be written as @xmath20 and @xmath3 transforms into    @xmath21    with @xmath22 dimensionally equivalent to the coupling @xmath7 of the ssh model .",
    "choosing the atomic mass @xmath23 of order @xmath24 times the electron mass , we get @xmath25 $ ] where @xmath6 is given in units of @xmath19 and the latter is given in @xmath26 .",
    "this transformation allows us to compare numerically the _ e - ph _ effective coupling in the two hamiltonian models .",
    "let s apply to the hamiltonians in eq.(1 ) space - time mapping techniques previously used i.e. in the path integral formulation of the theory of dilute magnetic alloys @xcite and in the path integral study of a15 compounds with strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",

    "accordingly , the hamiltonians in ( 3 ) are more general than the real space hamiltonians in ( 1 ) .",
    "note that , while the holstein model assumes a local _ e - ph _ interaction along the @xmath38 axis , in the ssh picture the electron hopping is accompanied by a time dependent displacement of the atomic coordinate .",

    "we introduce time dependent electron hops while maintaining the fundamental features of the ssh hamiltonian .",

    "thus , the general cumulant term is obtained by averaging the second of eqs.(6 ) over a set of electron particle paths :    @xmath68    two fourier components ( @xmath69 ) suffice to get numerical convergence in eq.(11 ) .",
    "we point out that , the computation of the anharmonic expansion in the ssh model requires for any choice of electron path coefficients , double summations over brillouin zone ( see eq.(4 ) ) and inverse temperature ( @xmath34 ) values ( see the second of eqs.(6 ) ) .",

    "the results are displayed in figures 1 for the case of a low energy oscillator and a narrow band hopping integral , @xmath77 .",
    "three values of @xmath7 are assumed to emphasize the dependence of the ssh model thermodynamics on the _ e - ph _ coupling .",
    "the @xmath78 value for the holstein model calculations yields a @xmath79 coincident with the largest @xmath80 .",
    "the holstein cumulant expansion causes a slight and slope preserving lowering of the phonon free energy with respect to the harmonic plot . as a consequence",
    "the holstein entropy and heat capacity , computed via eqs.(12 ) , are superimposed to the harmonic quantities . however , looking at fig.1(d ) ( case @xmath81 ) , we see that a large number of cumulant terms is required to get convergence in the holstein series as the cutoff @xmath71 markedly grows below @xmath82 , attaining the value @xmath83 at @xmath84 . thus , _",
    "e - ph _ anharmonicities strongly renormalize the holstein partition function , essentially stabilize the system , but there is no trace of anharmonicity in the phonon free energy temperature derivatives @xcite .",
    "much different is the trend of the anharmonic corrections in the ssh model .",
    "the main features can be summarized as follows : i ) the phonon free energy ( fig.1(a ) ) and its derivatives ( figs.1(b ) , ( c ) ) largely deviate from the harmonic plots and strongly depend on @xmath7 ; ii ) there is a threshold @xmath7 value above which the heat capacity displays a peak . by enhancing @xmath7 ( fig.1(c ) )",
    "the height of the peak grows and the bulk of the anharmonic effects on the heat capacity is shifted towards lower @xmath0 ; iii ) at high @xmath0 the anharmonic corrections renormalize downwards the phonon free energy but their effect on the heat capacity tends to decrease signalling that _ e - ph _ nonlinearities are rather to be seen in the intermediate temperature range .",
    "note that the size of the anharmonic enhancement is about a factor @xmath85 larger than the value of the harmonic oscillator heat capacity at @xmath86 ; iv ) the cutoff @xmath71 in the ssh model ( fig.1(d ) ) attains the value 10 at room temperature while the cumulant series converges with a low number of terms ( @xmath87 ) at low @xmath0 . at intermediate @xmath88 $ ]",
    ", the ssh cutoff overlaps the holstein cutoff at the value @xmath89 .",
    "the location of the heat capacity peak along the temperature axis strongly varies with the oscillator energy . in fig.2",
    "we select two energy values and report the crossover temperatures for a set of _ e - ph _ coupling strengths . by increasing @xmath19 at fixed @xmath7 the peak shifts towards high @xmath0 and it shows up above a minimum @xmath7 whose value increases at larger @xmath19 .",
    "thus , higher energy oscillators are more stable against _ e - ph _ induced anharmonicity since larger couplings are required to introduce signatures of non linear behavior in the phonon heat capacity .",
    "so far we have focussed on the thermodynamics of the phonon subsystem .",
    "the question arises whether and to which extent the _ anharmonic phonon _ heat capacity affects the _ total _ heat capacity of the ssh model . as discussed in ref.@xcite the total heat capacity",
    "is given by the phonon contribution plus a _ source _ heat capacity which includes both the electronic contribution ( related to the electron hopping integral ) and the contribution due to the source action ( the latter being @xmath90 , see eqs.(6 ) in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a bath of harmonic phonons has been assumed in our previous work .",
    "now we compare the anharmonic phonon heat capacity ( @xmath91 ) and the source heat capacity , here termed @xmath92 to emphasize the dependence both on the electronic and on the _ e - ph _ coupling terms .",
    "the plot displaying the largest peak in fig.1(c ) is reported on in fig.3(a ) while @xmath92 is computed according to the method described in in ref.@xcite after setting @xmath93 .",
    "also the total heat capacity ( @xmath94 ) is shown in fig.3(a ) . at low temperatures",
    ", @xmath92 yields the largest effect mainly due to the electronic hopping while at high @xmath0 , @xmath92 prevails as the source action becomes dominant . in the intermediate range ( @xmath95 $ ] ) the anharmonic phonons provide the highest contribution although their characteristic peak is substantially smeared in the total heat capacity by the source term background .",
    "fig.3(b ) compares @xmath91 and @xmath92 for two increasing values of @xmath7 : while the anharmonic peak shifts downwards ( along the @xmath0 axis ) by enhancing @xmath7 , @xmath91 remains larger than @xmath92 in a temperature range which progressively shrinks due to the strong dependence of the source action on the strength of the _ e - ph _ coupling .",
    "finally , it has to be pointed out that the low temperature upturn displayed in the _ total heat capacity over t _ ratio @xcite is not affected by the inclusion of phonon anharmonic effects which tend to become negligible at low temperatures .",
    "the holstein and the su - schrieffer - heeger hamiltonian present a fundamental difference with respect to the nature of the _ e - ph _ coupling . mapping the real space interactions onto the time scale we have shown that the holstein _ e - ph _ interactions are _ local _ in time while , in the ssh model , the electronic hopping induces a time dependent lattice displacement thus leading to a _ non local _ _ e - ph _ coupling . as a consequence the source current peculiar of the ssh model depends both on time and on the electron path coordinates .",
    "we have applied the path integral method to analyse the perturbing effects of the source currents ( in both models ) on the phonon subsystems by expanding the phonon partition function in cumulant series . in the low temperature limit , the constraint imposed by the third law of thermodynamics permits to determine the cutoff @xmath71 in the anharmonic expansion : while the ssh series converges rapidly , an high number of cumulants is required in the holstein model to stabilize the low @xmath0 equilibrium properties . at intermediate and high @xmath0",
    ", @xmath96 is comparable in both models .",
    "however , looking at the behavior of the thermodynamic properties we find striking differences between the two models .",
    "the holstein phonon heat capacity does not show any trace of anharmonicity induced by the _",
    "e - ph _ coupling while the ssh phonon heat capacity exhibits a peak whose location along the @xmath0 axis strongly depends on the strength of the coupling @xmath7 . by increasing @xmath7 at a fixed @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath71 grows and the phonon partition function becomes larger . as a result the point of _ most rapid decrease _ in the ssh phonon free energy versus temperature shifts downwards and the associated heat capacity peak is found at lower @xmath0 . at high temperatures the free energy decreases regularly and the anharmonic effects on the heat capacity are reduced .",
    "infact , at high @xmath0 , the time ( @xmath34 ) retardation between electron hopping and atomic displacement is shortened as @xmath34 encounters the upper limit of a small inverse temperature .",
    "finally , we have computed the general path integral in the ssh model for an electron path moving in a bath of anharmonic oscillators .",
    "we have derived the total heat capacity and pointed out the contribution of the anharmonic phonon with respect to the purely electronic and _ e - ph _ terms .",
    "the anharmonic effects are relevant in the intermediate temperature range whereas the peak is smeared by the electronic hopping term ( on the low temperature side ) and by the source action heat capacity at high temperatures .",
