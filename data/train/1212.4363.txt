    "recent experimental reports on the deracemization of racemic mixtures of crystals and on the crystallization from boiling solutions @xcite are striking examples of novel scenarios for spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking ( smsb ) for compounds for which the homochiral interactions are favored over the heterochiral ones . in other words , these are reactions that can not be explained by frank - like mechanisms , in which the heterochiral interaction is the favored one . despite some controversy about the actual mechanisms responsible for the smsb in these situations ,",
    "the experimental reports all coincide in that the final state is stationary : mechano - stationary in the case of wet grinding of racemic mixtures of crystals @xcite and the presence of temperature gradients in the case of deracemization and crystallization in boiling solutions @xcite .",
    "the above reports stress the fact that the racemic conglomerate crystal mixtures are deracemized in experimental conditions where _ chemical equilibrium is not possible _ ,",
    "i.e. , they require specific energy input to only some of the species of the system ( as in the crystal grinding experiments ) or else a non - uniform temperature distribution .",
    "the point of departure for the present paper is : if limited enantioselectivity @xcite in experimental conditions of closed systems with a uniform distribution of temperature and energy inexorably yields a final racemic state , @xcite then can smsb occur in scenarios of non - uniform temperature distributions ? as it turns out , this is in fact possible in the case that , in addition to a non - uniform temperature distribution , the systems possess a compartmentalization of the enantioselective and the non - enantioselective autocatalyses .",
    "the emergence of chirality in enantioselective autocatalysis for compounds which do not follow frank - like schemes is investigated here for the limited enantioselectivity ( les ) model composed of coupled enantioselective and non - enantioselective autocatalyses .",
    "the basic model @xcite is defined by the following chemical transformations .",
    "production of chiral compounds l , d from an achiral substrate a : @xmath0 autocatalytic production : @xmath1    limited enantioselectivity : @xmath2 in contrast to the frank model , les is able to account for two important facts : namely , ( i ) the enantioselectivity of any chiral catalyst is limited because of the third reaction eq.([limenant ] ) , and ( ii ) the kinetic link between mirror conjugate processes arises from the reversibility of the catalytic stage @xcite .",
    "the inverse reaction of the non - enantioselective autocatalysis ( reaction ( [ limenant ] ) ) substitutes for the mutual inhibition reaction in the frank model or formation of the heterodimer ( l + d @xmath3 p ) .",
    "earlier reports had claimed spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking ( smsb ) in les , but this can not occur in either open or closed systems with a _ uniform _ temperature distribution .",
    "the obstacle comes from microreversibility , where @xmath4 is the temperature dependent equilibrium constant : @xmath5 the condition for the instability of the racemic state is that @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ ineq1 ] ) , we must have @xmath9 so that @xmath10 .",
    "but from eq .",
    "( [ microrev1 ] ) , @xmath11 , which is incompatible with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is the situation for open systems . for closed systems",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that the racemic state is unstable provided that @xmath14 where the critical parameter in a closed system is always bounded above by the corresponding one for open systems , and approaches the latter from below in the limit of large total concentrations @xmath15 , that is : @xmath16 .",
    "but eq . ( [ closedles ] ) is also incompatible with eq .",
    "( [ microrev1 ] ) .",
    "so the racemic state is always asymptotically stable in this scheme for both open and closed systems held at a uniform temperature .",
    "therefore there can be no asymptotically stable chiral outcome in this model .",
    "nor can the les model lead to smsb in closed systems even with a stationary non - uniform temperature distribution . on the other hand , numerical simulations of chemical kinetics in a two - compartment model @xcite",
    "demonstrate that smsb may occur if both catalytic reactions ( [ autold2 ] ) and ( [ limenant ] ) are spatially separated at different temperatures in different compartments but coupled under the action of a continous internal flow .",
    "in such conditions the system can evolve , for certain reaction and system parameters , towards a chiral stationary state , i.e. , the system is able to reach a bifurcation point leading to smsb .",
    "this is an appealing result since numerical simulations using reasonable chemical parameters suggest that an adequate scenario for such an les - based smsb would be that of abyssal hydrothermal vents , by virtue of the typical temperature gradients found there and the role of inorganic solids mediating chemical reactions in an enzyme - like role .",
    "we therefore proposed @xcite that a natural prebiotic scenario for such emergence of chirality is that of abyssal hydrothermal vents and volcanic plumes @xcite which do have the adequate temperature gradients and contain solids , as for example clays , which have been proposed by several authors @xcite as catalysts in the prebiotic synthesis of organic compounds .    in view of the above",
    ", this paper deals with an analytic / numerical study of the conditions leading to the instability of the ideal racemic composition for the les model with compartmentalized catalysis ( [ autold2 ] ) and ( [ limenant ] ) in regions held at different temperatures . the two - compartment model ( sec [ sec : les - tgrad ] ) is already sufficiently involved as to make deriving general analytic stability results a near impossible task .",
    "we thus focus our efforts on analyzing properties of the racemic fixed point ; the analytic conditions for its linear stability can be set up and then tested in numerical domains .",
    "the direct study of the stationary chiral solutions is substantially more complicated and algebraically unwieldy .",
    "nevertheless , the characterization of a racemic state as unstable necessarily implies that the system evolves to a state of non - racemic composition .",
    "such a nonracemic state could be stable , chaotic or oscillatory .",
    "however , the many numerical smsb tests performed for reasonable reaction parameters and under the thermodynamic constraints imposed by the principle of microreversibility and the temperature dependencies of the reaction rate constants ( see sec [ sec : arrhenius ] ) have in all cases led to a stable chiral state . these stable states are scalemic mixtures of enantiomeric excesses ( ee ) whose values depend on the parameters of the phase diagram .",
    "we first review the impossibility of smsb in les with a stable temperature gradient .",
    "we then prove that smsb in such a system is possible when the two catalyses ( [ autold2 ] ) and ( [ limenant ] ) are compartmentalized ( localized ) in different temperature regions connected by an internal flow of material .",
    "consider the les scheme in a temperature gradient : this permits the reaction rates to vary spatially in the system , from one place to another , and might provide a way to achieve mirror symmetry breaking .",
    "the reverse reaction of ( [ limenant ] ) in one region ( compartment ) could be faster that the reverse of ( [ autold2 ] ) in the other . and then mixing could bring the hot and cold material into contact .",
    "we model this by a closed two - compartment system with volumes @xmath17 ; each compartment held at a uniform temperature , @xmath18 , and internally coupled by a constant internal flow or recycling .",
    "the concentrations , and reaction rates for the second compartment are labeled by an asterisk , see figure [ twocomps ] .",
    "limited enantioselectivity ( les ) in two compartments with volumns @xmath19 and @xmath20 each held at different temperatures @xmath21 and interconnected by an internal flow @xmath22 of material .",

    "certain thermodynamic relationships hold among the reaction rates in both compartments .",
    "these will be used to prove that smsb is also impossible for the scheme presented in sec [ sec : les - tgrad ] in a background temperature gradient . following this demonstration ,",
    "we then introduce the variant of les that can and does lead to smsb .    from arrhenius - eyring , the forward ( and reverse ) reaction rates for reaction @xmath34 at temperatures @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 denotes the difference in free energy between the activated state ( transition state ) and the reactants , while @xmath39 is the free energy difference between the activated state ( transition state ) and the products ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the enthalpy and entropy , respectively .",
    "from the above we can obtain a relation between the forward reaction rates @xmath34 in each compartment : @xmath42 clearly , once the values of the @xmath43 are chosen for the reference compartment at @xmath44 , we are not free to _ independently _ choose the reaction rates @xmath45 at the higher temperature @xmath35 .    the fundamental microreversibility condition eq.([microrev1 ] )",
    "together with arrhenius - eyring implies @xmath46 that is , the difference of the free energy differences @xmath47 must be _ independent _ of @xmath34 , that is , independent of the specific @xmath48 reaction .",
    "this implies that the individual double differences in enthalpy and in entropy must also be independent of reaction @xmath34 , so we must also have @xmath49 this also gives us an expression for calculating @xmath50 : @xmath51 the inverse reaction rates are obtained through the constraint eq.([microrev1 ] ) as follows : @xmath52    we also note that if the constraint eq .",

    "the situation is even worse for obtaining analytic information regarding the possible stationary chiral solutions .",
    "we appeal instead to chemically inspired conjectures that can be tested numerically for coherence and compatibility with microreversibility .",
    "first , it is clear that in view of the gradient @xmath55 , the putative condition , which could conceivably lead to symmetry breaking in the limit of small values of @xmath22 , @xmath56 is incompatible with the constraints in eqs .",
    "( [ kt],[microrev * ] ) . this condition ( [ conjecture1 ] )",
    "is inspired by the observation that for @xmath57 , the two compartments are practically isolated from each other and can be treated as approximately independent .",
    "these are thus the necessary conditions for obtaining an unstable racemic solution in each compartment ( see sec [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "but they are incompatible with microreversibility .",
    "secondly , the analysis in sec [ sec : intro ] suggests that smsb might occur when the inverse reaction of ( [ limenant ] ) in one region is _",
    "faster _ than the inverse reaction of ( [ autold2 ] ) in the other region .",
    "taking microreversibility into account , the only way this might be achieved is , for example , by arranging for @xmath58 but this is forbidden by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ ratiok ] ) , which is satisfied by the ratio of the equilibrium constants .",
    "so a temperature gradient and internal flow are by themselves , not enough to produce a bifurcation .",
    "actually , no spatially varying temperature profile is sufficient , as can be seen by partitioning the closed system into a number of sufficiently small regions within which the local temperature is approximately uniform .",
    "our working hypothesis is that a _ necessary but not sufficient _ condition for the instability of the racemic solution is @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the presence of immobilized catalysts that ensure that @xmath61 in one region and @xmath62 in the other @xcite .",
    "other conditions ( total system concentration @xmath15 , the flow rate @xmath22 , compartment volumes @xmath17 , etc . ) also come into play for determining the overall instability , in a highly nontrivial and nonlinear fashion .      the equations ( [ detad],[detal ] ) for @xmath63 are identically satisfied for the stationary solution @xmath64 .",
    "we therefore carry out a stability analysis of this racemic fixed point and determine whether the racemic solution ( racemic in _ both _ compartments ) is asymptotically stable or unstable .",
    "this will depend on the internal _ flow parameter _",

    "the entropy production suffers a peak at the onset of the induction period , reflecting the fact that the catalysis of enantiomers eq .",
    "( [ autold2 ] ) , and subsequent depletion of achiral substrate , is the most important contribution .",
    "the production then falls to a small but constant nonzero value and remains nonzero as long as the system is kept out of equilibrium . in the case of figure [ symbreak2 ] ,",
    "the entropy production starts off from a large value then drops ( at the same time scale as the peak in figure [ symbreak1 ] ) and subsequently drops down to its minimum nonzero value at the symmetry breaking bifurcation .",
    "it again remains small but nonzero as long as the system is kept out of equilibrium .",
    "compartmentalization , together with different temperatures for the enantioselective and the non - enantioselective autocatalyses , was shown to be a necessary condition for smsb .",
    "the temperature gradient and internal flow or recycling of hot and cold material is the required driving force keeping the system far from equilibrium . on the basis of the stability analysis of the racemic final state ,",
    "the results presented here demonstrate the existence of smsb as a closed region ( see figs . 3 , 5 and 6 ) in the phase representation of the reaction parameters .",
    "explicit examples of smsb are displayed in figures [ symbreak1 ] and [ symbreak2 ] showing also the time dependence of the associated production of entropy for starting from two different initial concentrations .",
    "the considerations given to the microreversibility condition in secs [ sec : intro ] , [ sec : les - tgrad ] and [ sec : arrhenius ] serve to underscore the fact that limited enantioselectivity - of and by itself can not lead to spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking , neither for a uniform temperature ( i.e. at an experimental condition required to attain chemical equilibrium ) , not even for two temperatures ( i.e. an experimental condition that excludes chemical equilibrium ) . by contrast , mirror symmetry breaking may be possible when in addition to a non - uniform temperature distribution the reactions ( ii ) and ( iii ) occur in two distinct compartments held at different temperatures . the microreversibility arguments",
    "@xcite , used as a proof of the correctness of the model , are necessary because we assume a scenario where chemical kinetics can be applied .",
    "we briefly point out what modifications would have to be made in order to consider spatial temperature gradients .",
    "first , we need to input the temperature profile @xmath131 as a known field .",
    "this converts the reaction rates @xmath43 into spatially dependent functions via the arrhenius relation .",
    "the kinetic rate equations must be replaced by partial differential reaction - diffusion - advection equations for the spatial and temporal dependence of the concentrations .",
    "the background convective flow of hot / cold material could be modeled by a steady hydrodynamical flow - field compatible with the compartment boundary conditions . in short ,",
    "the technical complications would be considerable , but not insurmountable .",
    "the significance of the above results with respect to applied absolute synthesis is somewhat limited due to the temperature difference required for achieving the essential inequality @xmath59 .",
    "the point is , a sufficiently large difference would require high pressure conditions as well to maintain the media in a liquid state .",
    "by contrast , the results can be of significance in scenarios of prebiotic chemistry . in this context , the required experimental conditions of high temperature gradients and compartmentalization agree with those found in deep ocean hydrothermal vents , as we have previously reported @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the more relevant feature of this les scenario is its ability to exhibit smsb at very low reactant concentrations . in this respect , the detailed description given here for the effect on the smsb dependence of the minimal internal flow rate -with respect to the compartment volumes at different temperatures- and on the reaction rate inequality @xmath59",
    ", shows that the variability range for smsb of these parameters increases when the total system concentration @xmath15 decreases , i.e. the probabilities for smsb to occur _ increase _ in a prebiotic scenario .",
    "notice that this overcomes the more important difficulty for a reasonable smsb in a prebiotic scenario , where a specific prebiotic organic compound could be present , but only at very low concentrations .",
    "this , in spite of the presence of an important fraction of organic compounds , because of the diversity of different organic compounds in prebiotic scenarios @xcite . while les is ruled out as a scheme for smsb in experimental conditions where thermodynamic equilibrium can be achieved , the results presented here open up the study for smsb in scenarios of non - uniform temperature distributions , specific energy inputs to some species of the system , and compartmentalization , i.e. in conditions similar to those of living systems .",
