    "the discovery of graphene @xcite established the possibility to obtain stable two - dimensional solids , and it was soon realized that layered materials other than graphite can be used as bulk parents for novel two - dimensional materials @xcite . as in graphite , the weak van der waals interactions between adjacent atomic layers in alternative parent materials , such as transition metal dichalogenides ( tmdcs ) , permit mechanical exfoliation of a single - layer ( sl ) with electronic properties that differ in subtle but important ways from those of the bulk material .",
    "one example is the indirect to direct band gap transition observed in case of mos@xmath5 @xcite and other tmdcs @xcite .",
    "sl tmdcs consist of a layer of metal sandwiched between two layers of chalcogens .",
    "these materials exhibit a variety of electronic properties , ranging from insulating to metallic @xcite .",
    "probably the most studied sl tmdcs are molybdenum dichalcogenides , which are attractive materials for electronic applications such as transistors @xcite , diodes @xcite , photoemitting devices @xcite , solar cells @xcite and memristors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the unique spin texture of both conduction and valence band makes sl tmdcs well - suited for studying quantum degrees of freedom such as spin or valley pseudospin or their interactions @xcite . in the case of the tungsten dichalcogenides ,",
    "much stronger spin - orbit coupling is expected than in the case of the mo - based analogues , and the properties just enumerated should thus be more stable at room temperature @xcite . naively , a strong spin - orbit splitting of the bands can be expected to result in an increased band curvature near the top of the valence band and hence to a reduced effective mass ; and indeed , ws@xmath0 is predicted to be the best material among all of the tmdcs for a transistor channel , due to its low effective hole mass @xcite .    many proposed approaches to characterizing the electronic properties of sl tmdcs , as well as many potential applications , require large area and high quality samples . in the present work , we introduce a method for the epitaxial growth of ws@xmath0 on au(111 ) .",
    "we study the growth and structure by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and core level spectroscopy .",
    "the high quality of the sl ws@xmath0 obtained in this procedure permits an investigation of the electronic structure by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "the results confirm the expected strong splitting of the sl ws@xmath0 valence band at @xmath1 , indications of which had already been seen in early experiments on single layers @xcite .",
    "the splitting is found to be almost three times larger than the spin - splitting determined for sl mos@xmath0 @xcite with a strong warping of the constant energy contours around the @xmath1 point .",
    "the expected lower effective mass near the valence band maximum is also confirmed .",
    "growth and measurements were performed at the sgm3 endstation at the astrid2 synchrotron radiation facility @xcite . prior to growth , the au(111 )",
    "single crystal substrate was thoroughly cleaned by repeated cycles of ne ion sputtering ( e=0.75  kev ) and annealing ( 600@xmath6c ) in ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) until the regular herringbone reconstruction was observed by stm . in the first step of the growth procedure ,",
    "tungsten was evaporated onto the clean surface using a commercial e - beam evaporator charged with a 99.95% purity w rod . during the evaporation ,",
    "the sample was exposed to 99.6% purity h@xmath0s using a homemade nozzle situated @xmath7  cm from the sample .",
    "this allowed for a local pressure at the sample face that was higher than the background pressure in the chamber ( which was maintained at @xmath8  mbar ) . in the second step ,",
    "the sample was annealed to 650@xmath6c for 30 minutes , maintaining the h@xmath9s atmosphere .",
    "this procedure is similar to that used in ref . to obtain ws@xmath0 nano clusters . in order to obtain a large coverage of ws@xmath0 ,",
    "however , it is necessary to repeat the above sequence .",
    "the number of growth cycles determines the coverage of the sl ws@xmath0 film .",
    "a last anneal at 750@xmath6c under uhv conditions was used to desorb any residual contamination from the growth process .",
    "the sample quality was examined by stm , leed and core level spectroscopy using a photon energy of 140  ev .",
    "the reported core level binding energies have been calibrated using the bulk component binding energy of the clean au(111 ) substrate @xcite .",
    "the characterization of the film was performed at room temperature .",
    "arpes measurements were carried out at a temperature of @xmath10  k , with energy and angular resolutions better than 20  mev and 0.2@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "measurements were taken with photon energies in the range of 14 - 80  ev .",
    "the ws@xmath0-related bands did not show a @xmath11 dispersion in this energy range , confirming the two - dimensional character of the system ( photon energy scans not presented here ) .",
    "representative stm images of sl ws@xmath0 on au(111 ) are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] . the small lattice mismatch between the substrate ( @xmath12   ) and sl ws@xmath0 ( @xmath13   ) @xcite leads to a modulation of the local density of states , resulting in the observed moir pattern ( fig .  [",

    "[ fig : fig3](b ) . the surface component intensity is largely reduced and shifted towards the bulk component by 58(32 )  mev with respect to clean au(111 ) .",
    "it is difficult to analyze this spectral change in detail , as there are several factors contributing to it .",
    "the first is the actual suppression or shift of the surface core level component due to the interaction with the sulphur .",
    "the second is the remaining presence of clean au(111 ) patches that should give rise to a much weaker but largely un - shifted surface component .    the w  4f core level spectrum consists of a spin - orbit split doublet with each peak showing an intense high binding energy component and a weak low energy component .",
    "the observed binding energies for the main components are e@xmath23  ev and e@xmath24  ev .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of the states is thus 2.13(02 )  ev .",

    "however , there is a clear difference between the spectra here and those previously reported for smaller nano - scale ws@xmath0 islands on au(111 ) @xcite , for which two almost equally strong components were found in each spin - orbit split peak of the w 4f core level .",
    "those findings were interpreted in terms of core level components from the edges as well as from the basal plane of the ws@xmath0 nano clusters , consistent with findings for mos@xmath0 clusters @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig4](a ) .",
    "the uppermost valence band of sl ws@xmath0 is discernible for binding energies larger than 1.2  ev , especially between @xmath2 and @xmath1 and towards @xmath28 .",
    "the band is significantly sharper within the projected bulk band gaps of au around @xmath1 ( outlined by dashed lines ) than near @xmath2 and @xmath28 . near @xmath28",
    "the ws@xmath0 states strongly hybridize with the gold continuum and can not be discerned .",
    "the maximum of the valence band is found to be situated at @xmath1 ( @xmath29  ev higher than at @xmath2 ) , consistent with the expected direct band gap at @xmath1 .",
    "the observation of a single valence band at @xmath2 with a higher binding energy than at @xmath1 also rules out a significant contribution from bilayer ws@xmath0 : in bilayer tmdc systems , the valence band near @xmath2 shows a bonding / anti - bonding splitting that would be observable by arpes as two bands , in contrast to what is seen here @xcite .",
    "the overall observed dispersion of the band structure is in good agreement with calculations for a free - standing sl ws@xmath0 ( red dashed lines)@xcite , notably around @xmath1 . divergence from these calculations in terms of a shift towards higher binding energy is seen near @xmath2 , similar to what has previously been observed for sl mos@xmath0/au(111 ) , where it was attributed to an interaction with the substrate @xcite .",
    "the bands around @xmath2 are a mixture of out - of - plane w d@xmath30 and s p@xmath31 orbitals , which can participate in bond formations with the au and as a result change the band dispersion @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , the valence bands at the @xmath1 points are derived mainly from in - plane w d@xmath32 and d@xmath33 orbitals .",
    "these are not only less likely to be affected by the interaction with the substrate , but the states nearby are also situated in a projected bulk band gap .",
    "note that this situation is distinctly different from the case of graphene where the bands near @xmath1 are formed from out - of plane @xmath34 orbitals .",
    "this difference in orbital character near the @xmath1 point also explains the absence of replicas induced by the moir superstructure for sl ws@xmath0/au(111 ) , something that is observed in arpes from epitaxial graphene systems @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature of the sl ws@xmath5 valence band structure is the large spin - splitting at the @xmath1 points .",
    "this lifting of the spin degeneracy is a characteristic feature of the sl and due to the removal of the inversion symmetry present in the 2h bulk material and in the bilayer @xcite .",
    "however , even in the sl material , the splitting is constrained by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this forbids a splitting at @xmath2 and the additional combination with translational symmetry also forbids a splitting at @xmath28 . in a simple picture ,",
    "the size of the splitting at @xmath1 strongly depends on the atomic spin - orbit splitting and it is thus expected to be significantly larger for w than for mo .    the spin - splitting near @xmath1 is investigated in more detail using the data in fig .",

    "( @xmath35=462  mev ) and sl wte@xmath5 ( @xmath35=480  mev ) are expected to exhibit a larger spin - splitting @xcite , something that was recently confirmed for sl wse@xmath5 @xcite",
    ".    a closer look at the contours in the constant energy surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](c ) ) reveals an anisotropy of the valence band dispersion around @xmath1 , visible as a trigonal warping ( tw ) .",
    "this effect is theoretically predicted and in the simplest approximation can be described as a third order correction to the parabolic energy dispersion  @xcite . in the @xmath36 formalism , it is caused by the interaction terms between the uppermost valence band with the lower lying valence bands @xcite .",
    "tw reflects the underlying three - fold rotational symmetry of the crystal structure .",
    "it should be noted that this effect is connected to the general electronic structure rather than to the relativistic spin - orbit coupling : thus , for example , it is also present for graphite and graphene where spin - orbit coupling is negligible @xcite .     on au(111 ) along the @xmath37-@xmath1-@xmath37 direction , as indicated in the inset.(b ) energy distribution curve through the @xmath1 point ( red dashed line in ( a ) ) fitted with two lorentzian profiles and quadratic background .",
    "( c ) constant energy contours close to the @xmath1 point .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 coordinates have @xmath1 as origin.,width=309 ]    given the constraint that the spin - splitting has to vanish at @xmath2 and @xmath28 , the size of the splitting at @xmath1 can be expected to indirectly affect the band curvature of the valence band maximum and thus the hole effective mass of the material .",
    "this is investigated by determining the effective masses near @xmath1 . for consistency with calculations @xcite and to avoid the problem of a directional dependence due to the tw , the effective mass has been fitted in a region very close to the @xmath1 point ( @xmath40  @xmath41 ) along the @xmath2-@xmath1-@xmath28 direction .",
    "this procedure leads to hole effective masses for vb1 and vb2 ( defined in fig .",

    "@xcite yields @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the effective mass of the uppermost valence band is therefore indeed reduced , consistent with the naive expectation ( even though this model does not attempt to explain why @xmath46 is also reduced ) .",
    "all these values are in good agreement with calculations @xcite .",
    "finally , an interesting difference between the data presented here and that reported previously for sl mos@xmath0/au(111 ) @xcite is the very clear presence of the au(111 ) surface state near @xmath2 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . for sl mos@xmath0/au(111 ) , only a very faint signature of this state was reported .",
    "this difference is ascribed to the slightly different preparation procedure . in the present work ,",
    "the synthesis and all the analysis were performed in a single uhv system without ever exposing the sample to air . in the previous work for sl mos@xmath0/au(111 ) , synthesis and arpes were performed in separate uhv systems , and the sample was transferred between them through air .",
    "after such a transfer , atomically clean sl mos@xmath0 can be recovered by a brief anneal , and the measured electronic structure of the layer is not affected .",
    "this , however , is not necessarily the case for the remaining clean au(111 ) terraces , where the surface state might remain quenched by adsorbed contaminants  at least , this may be the case for the low annealing temperature of 500  k used in ref . .",
    "the observed surface state in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] is thus likely to be located on the remaining clean terraces and not under the sl ws@xmath0 .",
    "we have introduced a preparation method for high - quality epitaxial sl ws@xmath0 on au(111 ) and studied the electronic structure of this system .",
    "the observed valence band dispersion of sl ws@xmath0/au(111 ) around @xmath1 and the spin - splitting at @xmath1 of @xmath35=419(11 )  mev are found to be in good agreement with calculations for the free - standing layer @xcite .",
    "the strong spin - orbit splitting contributes to a lowering of the hole effective mass near the valence band maximum , suggesting that ws@xmath0 could be a more suitable material for electronic applications than mos@xmath0 .",
