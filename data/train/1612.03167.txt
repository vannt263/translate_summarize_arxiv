    "entanglement and squeezing are normally generated through parametric processes such as parametric down conversion @xcite and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) @xcite .",
    "fwm can realize an effective coupling of beamsplitter type between two light fields @xcite , which can be applied to generate the important categories of photonic quantum states , such as cat states and symmetric entangled states . in the present work we consider a raman - type dispersive fwm to realize a similar beamsplitter type coupling for other applications including transferring squeezing between different modes , amplifying the amplitude of",
    "one squeezed mode and entangling different quantum modes .",
    "there are two degenerate counterpropagating electromagnetic fields as the pump in our concerned system , and they realize an effective standing wave creating the spatial modulation of the nonlinearities for the input quantum light fields .",
    "this structure behaves like photonic crystals that are widely used for control light propagation @xcite . to avoid the influence of the quantum noises that are critical to the entanglement generation ( see , e.g. @xcite )",
    ", we use a dispersive parametric interaction , so that the one - photon detuning and two - photon detuning in the process are large enough to prevent the real excitation of the atomic system from its ground states and only the quantum state of the light fields will be changed during the close - loop parametric interaction , which involves the two counter - propagating quantum modes and the standing wave of the pump field .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present a description of the model in sec .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the system in the dispersive regime is derived in sec .",

    "let us consider a three - level atomic system with the ground state @xmath0 and two upper states @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; see fig .",

    "the classical standing electromagnetic field with the rabi frequency @xmath3 implements the transition @xmath4 .",
    "such classical standing wave is applied along @xmath5 - direction and can be decomposed into two running wave with the wave vectors @xmath6 . the two counterpropagating quantum modes that are coupled to the transition @xmath7 with the coupling parameter @xmath8  also propagate along @xmath5  direction .",

    "in what follows we will consider a regime of the dispersive interaction , where the large detunings of the electromagnetic fields prevent the real transitions of the three - level system from its ground state .",
    "so , the atomic system remains the same initial state @xmath18 during the interaction , and only the quantum states of the optical fields can be changed .",
    "the classical field is assumed to be much stronger than the quantum ones . in order to derive the effective hamiltonian in the dispersive regime we use an adiabatic elimination technique @xcite .",
