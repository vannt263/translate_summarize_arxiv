    "minimizing hypercones have fascinating originations and active developments in geometric measure theory , for example , the pioneering works fleming @xcite , de giorgi @xcite , almgren @xcite , simons @xcite , bombieri - de giorgi - giusti @xcite for solving the celebrated bernstein problem .",
    "many types of minimizing hypercones beyond simons cones were discovered by lawson in @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , the arguments for strict minimality in his  9 were invalid due to the incorrect remark 9.17 on the correct formula in @xcite .",

    "since a tangent cone ( at some point ) of an area - minimizing rectifiable current is itself area - minimizing ( theorem 5.4.3 in @xcite , also see theorem 35.1 and remark 34.6 ( 2 ) in @xcite ) , the study of minimizing cones of higher codimensions is of equal importance .",
    "besides minimal isoparametric hypersurfaces , another class of minimal submanifolds associated with isoparametric foliations are focal submanifolds . by the efforts of @xcite , cones over focal submanifolds of homogeneous isoparametric foliations with @xmath3 distinct principal curvatures and multiplicities",
