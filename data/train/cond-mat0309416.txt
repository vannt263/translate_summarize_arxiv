    "@xcite present statistical evidence that appears to show that the nyse and paris data are consistent with the hypothesis that the average market impact follows a square root law . in this section",
    "we show that their test may have problems in circumstances ( such as those of the real data ) in which orders have long - memory properties .",
    "this weakens their test , so that it lacks the power to reject reasonable alternative hypotheses and may give misleading results .",
    "their method to test the hypothesis of square root price impact is to investigate @xmath10 $ ] over a given time interval , e.g. @xmath11 minutes , where @xmath6 is the price shift and @xmath12 is the sum of the volumes of the @xmath13 transactions occurring in that time interval . they have chosen to analyze @xmath14 rather than @xmath6 because of its properties under time aggregation . to see why this might be useful , assume the return due to each transaction",
    "@xmath15 is of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an iid noise process that is uncorrelated with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the sign of the transaction .",
    "the squared return for the interval is then of the form @xmath20 under the assumption that @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath19 , and @xmath22 are all uncorrelated , when @xmath8 it is easy to show that @xmath10=a + b~v$ ] , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants .",
    "the problem is that for the real data @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath19 , and @xmath22 are strongly correlated , and indeed , the sequence of signs @xmath19 is a long - memory process @xcite . to demonstrate the gravity of this problem",
    ", we use real transactions @xmath18 , but introduce an artificial and deterministic market impact function of the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "we first fix the number of transactions , and then repeat the same procedure using a fixed time period .",
    "we examine blocks of trades with @xmath13 transactions , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) for buyer ( seller ) initiated trades and @xmath18 is the volume of the trade in number of shares . for each trade",
    "we create an artificial price return @xmath31 , where @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "then for each block of @xmath13 trades we compute @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "since we are using the real order flow we are incorporating the correct autocorrelation of the signs @xmath19 and transaction sizes @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ exprsq](a ) shows @xmath10 $ ] for different values of @xmath13 and @xmath34 for the british stock vodafone in the period from may 2000 to december 2002 , a series which contains approximately @xmath35 trades .",

    "the value @xmath43 is roughly the average number of trades in a @xmath11  minute interval .",
    "we also show error bars computed as specified by gabaix et al .",
    "we can not reject the null hypothesis of a linear relation between @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath3 with @xmath39 confidence , even though we have a large amount of data , and we know by construction that @xmath44 is quite different from @xmath45 .",
    "we have also performed tests on other stocks , which give similar results .",
    "one can ask whether it makes a difference that we used a fixed number of transactions rather than a fixed time interval . to test this we repeat the procedure using a fixed time interval of @xmath11  minutes .",
    "figure  [ exprsq](b ) shows the result .",
    "we see an even clearer linear relation between @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath3 than before , so that the test once again fails .    why does nt this test work ? to gain some understanding of this , we repeat the same test but shuffle the order of the data , which breaks the correlation structure . as shown in figure  [ exprsq](c ) , the result in this case is far from linear even when @xmath43 , and the test easily shows that the market impact does not follow a square root law .",
    "thus , we see that the problem lies in the autocorrelation structure of the real data .    in conclusion",
    "our numerical simulations show that the linearity test of @xmath10 $ ] lacks power to test for a square root market impact with data containing the correlation structure of real data .",
    "in fact , even a deterministic market impact like @xmath46 is consistent with the relation @xmath10=a+b~v$ ] for a sufficiently large number of trades . doing this for a fixed time interval rather than a fixed number of trades time",
    "makes this even more evident .",
    "thus the test of gabaix et al .",
    "provides no evidence that the average market impact follows a square root law .",
    "while there have been many previous studies of average market impact , they have not included the statistical analysis needed to assign good error bars . in this section",
    "we present results about average market impact at the level of individual ticks .",
    "we show that it does not generally follow a square root law , and that it varies from market to market and in some cases from stock to stock in a substantial and statistically significant way .",
    "realistic error bars for the average market impact are difficult to assess due to the fact that volatility is a long - memory process @xcite .",
    "that is , its time series has a slowly decaying power law autocorrelation function that is asymptotically of the form @xmath47 , with @xmath48 so that the integral is unbounded .",
    "this makes error analysis complicated , since data from the distant past have a strong effect on data in the present . because volatility is long - memory , the price returns that fall in a given volume bin @xmath49 , which are by definition all of the same sign , are also long - memory .",
    "this means that the errors in measuring market impact are much larger than one would expect from intuition based on an iid hypothesis .",
    "we analyze the market impact only for orders ( or portions of orders ) that result in immediate transactions .",
    "we call the portion of an order that results in an immediate transaction an effective market order , and for the remainder of the paper @xmath18 represents effective market order size rather than transaction size .",
    "each order of size @xmath18 generates a price return @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the midpoint price quote just before the order is placed and @xmath52 is the midpoint price quote just after .",
    "we analyze buy and sell orders separately .",
    "the electronic ( sets ) data for the lse has the advantage that the data set contains a record of orders , and so we can distinguish buy and sell orders unambiguously , but has the disadvantage that it omits trades made in the upstairs market . for the nyse data we use the trades and quotes ( taq ) data to infer orders and their signs using the lee and ready algorithm @xcite ; to identify orders we lump together all trades with the same timestamp and order code . to estimate the average market impact we sort the events @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) with the same sign @xmath19 into bins based on @xmath18 and plot the average value of @xmath18 for each bin against the average value of @xmath54 , as shown in figure  [ mktimpactfig ] .",
    "we choose the bins so that each bin has roughly the same number of points in it .",
    "are binned together ; on the horizontal axis we show the average volume of the orders in each bin , and on the vertical axis the average size of the logarithmic price change for the orders in that bin . in both cases comparison to the dashed black line in the corner , which has slope @xmath45 ,",
    "makes it clear that the behavior for large volume does not follow a law of the form @xmath55 .",
    "error bars are computed using the variance plot method @xcite as described in the text . ]    to assign error bars for each bin we use the variance plot method  @xcite . for each bin we split the events into @xmath56 subsamples with @xmath57 points , where @xmath58 is the number of records in the bin .",
    "the subsamples are chosen to be blocks of values adjacent in time .",
    "for each subsample @xmath15 we compute the mean @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "then we compute the standard deviation of the @xmath59 which we indicate as @xmath61 . by plotting @xmath61 versus @xmath62 in a log - log plot",
    "we compute the hurst exponent @xmath63 by fitting the data with a power - law function @xmath64 .",
    "we compute the error in the mean of the entire sample of @xmath58 points by extrapolating the fitted function to the value @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the ordinary least square estimate of the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath63 .",
    "interestingly , for smaller values of @xmath18 we find hurst exponents substantially larger than @xmath45 , whereas for large values of @xmath18 the hurst exponents are much closer to @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath70 the error bars are typically much larger than standard errors can not be due to a difference in the mean interval between samples . ] .    in figure [ mktimpactfig ]",
    "we show empirical measurements of the average market impact for the new york stock exchange and for the london stock exchange .",
    "we consider three highly capitalized stocks for each exchange , lloyds ( lloy ) , shell ( shel ) and vodafone ( vod ) for the lse , and general electric ( ge ) , procter & gamble ( pg ) and at&t ( t ) for the nyse . for lse stocks we consider the period may 2000- december 2002 , while for nyse stocks we consider the time period 1995 - 1996 .",
    "the data for the nyse are consistent with results reported earlier without error bars @xcite , while the lse market impact data is new .",
    "the nyse data clearly do not follow a power law across the whole range , consistent with earlier results in references @xcite . while @xmath71 for small @xmath18 , for larger @xmath18 it appears that @xmath72 . as shown in reference @xcite ,",
    "this transition occurs for smaller values of @xmath18 for stocks with lower capitalization .",
    "thus , the assumption that @xmath73 breaks down for high volumes , precisely where it is necessary in order for the theory of gabaix et al . to hold . for the london data the power law assumption seems more justified across the whole range , but",
    "the exponent is too low ; a least squares fit gives @xmath74 .",
    "while we have not attempted to compute error bars for the regression , a visual comparison with the error bars of the individual bins makes it quite clear that @xmath8 is inconsistent with either the london or the nyse data .",
    "a separate study of eleven lse stocks gives @xmath75 for buy orders and @xmath76 for sell orders @xcite ; in as yet unpublished work this has been extended to @xmath77 stocks , with similar results .",
    "our earlier study for the nyse was based on 1000 stocks @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the average market impact functions are qualitatively different for lse and nyse stocks , and that for nyse stocks the functional form varies with market capitalization @xcite .",
    "even if we abandon the prediction that the average market impact is a square root law , one might imagine that we could explain fluctuations in prices in terms of fluctuations in volume modulated by average market impact of the form @xmath78 . however , if this were true , for the nyse the predicted exponent for price fluctuations would be @xmath79 , which is much too large to agree with the data .",
    "( a typical value @xcite is @xmath80 ) . to make matters even worse , the power law hypothesis for volume or market impact appears to fail in some other markets . in the paris stock exchange bouchaud et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the average market impact function , but breaks down for higher @xmath18 ] is of the form @xmath82 , yielding @xmath83 in the limit as @xmath84 .",
    "for the london stock exchange the power law hypothesis for average market impact seems reasonable , but with an exponent significantly smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the volume for the electronic market is not power law distributed , as discussed in the next section .",
    "note that we are making all the above statements for individual orders , whereas many studies have been done based on aggregated data over a fixed time interval .",
    "aggregating the data in time complicates the discussion , since the functional form of the market impact generally depends on the length of the time interval .",
    "hence it is more meaningful to do the analysis based on individual transactions .",
    "the theory of gabaix et al . explains the power law of returns in terms of the power law of volume , so if volume does nt have a power law , then returns should nt either .",
    "the existence of a power law tail for volume seems to vary from market to market . for the nyse",
    "we confirm the observation of power law tails for volume reported earlier @xcite .",
    "however in figure  [ voldist ] we show the distribution of volumes for three stocks in the electronic market of the lse . in order to compare different stocks we normalize the data by dividing by the sample",
    "mean for each stock .",
    "data points for each stock .",
    "( b ) @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the cumulative density function of returns induced by the same transactions in ( a ) . for the normalized volume there is no clear evidence for power law tails ; in contrast for returns this is quite plausible .",
    "furthermore , the volume distributions are essentially identical , whereas the return distribution for vod decays more steeply than the others .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   data points for each stock .",
    "( b ) @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the cumulative density function of returns induced by the same transactions in ( a ) . for the normalized volume",
    "there is no clear evidence for power law tails ; in contrast for returns this is quite plausible .",
    "furthermore , the volume distributions are essentially identical , whereas the return distribution for vod decays more steeply than the others .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    all three stocks have strikingly similar volume distributions ; this is true for the roughly twenty stocks that we have studied .",
    "there is no clear evidence for power law scaling , even though the power law scaling of the corresponding return distributions shown in figure  [ voldist](b ) is rather clear .",
    "if one attempts to fit lines to the larger volume range of the curve ( roughly @xmath87 ) , the exponent of the cumulative distribution corresponding to figure  [ voldist](a ) is highly uncertain but it is at least @xmath88 , which together with the measured values of @xmath44 would imply @xmath89 . in contrast , the measured exponents for figure  [ voldist](b ) are roughly @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 for shel , lloy , and vod respectively . it is noteworthy that vod has a much larger @xmath93 than the other stocks , even though it has essentially the same volume distribution and a similar volume distribution ; if anything from figure  [ mktimpactfig ] it s @xmath44 is larger than that of the other stocks , which according to @xmath94 would imply a smaller @xmath93 .",
    "this provides yet more evidence that the power law tails of returns are not driven by those of volume .",
    "note that one of the differences between the nyse and the lse data examined here , which may be the underlying cause of the difference in their distributions , is that the data from the nyse includes upstairs market trades , whereas the lse data does not .",
    "we have shown that the conclusions of gabaix et al .",
    "@xcite are suspect for three different reasons : first , their statistical analysis in claiming the existence of a square root law for average market impact lacks power to reject alternative hypotheses in the presence of the strong autocorrelations that are present in real data ; second , new measurements of the average market impact with proper error bars show that it does not follow a square root law ; third , for electronic data the london stock exchange the distribution of volumes does not have a power law tail , and there are substantial variations between the return distributions that are not reflected in variations in volume or average market impact .",
    "thus , it seems that the distribution of large price fluctuations can not be explained as a simple transformation of volume fluctuations .",
    "this leaves open the question of what really causes the power law tails of prices .",
    "we believe that the correct explanation lies in the extension of theories based on the stochastic properties of order placement and price formation @xcite , which naturally give rise to fluctuations in the response of prices to orders .",
    "further work is clearly needed .",
    "note added in press : in a recent study it has been shown that large price fluctuations in the nyse and the electronic portion of the lse are driven by fluctuations in liquidity @xcite . that is , if one matches up returns with the orders that generate them , the conditional distribution of large returns is essentially independent of order size .",
    "this has been confirmed for the nyse and island by weber and rosenow @xcite .",
    "the idea that the tail of prices is driven by fluctuations in liquidity rather than fluctuations in the number of trades was implicitly suggested earlier by results of plerou et al .",
