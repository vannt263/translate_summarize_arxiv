    "the first task of next generation colliders such as the ilc , the cepc and the fcc - ee is precision measurement , of higgs physics as well as z - pole physics and tri - gauge boson physics and so on .",
    "if there is new physics , it is expected to show up first as corrections to the standard model ( sm ) processes , subject to such precision measurements .",
    "the corrections can be naturally sorted by dimension-6 operators in the sm effective field theory ( eft ) , which has a total of 59 independent operators for one family of fermions as a complete basis  @xcite .",
    "precision measurements can be translated into a set of constraints on ( part of ) the operators .",
    "the operator level fitting process is ( uv ) model independent . on the other hand , in literature",
    "there are many popular new physics models with different motivations and merits .",
    "previously the matching of new physics to the model independent operator constraints are mostly electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) and higgs cross sections / decay branching ratios . for the most important subset of pure bosonic operators and at one - loop level which is usually leading with occasional exceptions , a method called the covariant derivative expansion ( cde )  @xcite has greatly facilitate the matching procedure , with advantage of being complete for all operators simultaneously , model independence in computation process , and giving analytical results .",
    "it is an industry to scan for uv models and match them to the sm eft  @xcite , but before that some generalizations of the cde technique need to be made .",
    "in addition to the generalization to fermionic degree of freedom ( dof ) which has extra gamma matrices related contributions  @xcite , for realistic model parameters the original assumption of degeneracy of large scales is too simplified to be dropped .",
    "since the cde algebra has already been formulated in matrix basis , it s not a hard generalization to use nondegenerate large scales , and use heavily the integration of feynman parameterization at the textbook level after taking traces .",
    "here we do sample calculations for the sfermion sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we expand the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) potential with covariant derivatives , matching it to a maximal set of bosonic operators , getting their wilson coefficients .",
    "in addition to the nondegeneracy of soft mass squares we keep the small bottom / tau yukawa couplings , and the differences between the squark sector and the slepton sector are accounted by different @xmath2 representations and @xmath3 hypercharges .",
    "the analytical results at one - loop level should be complete and realistic to use for various purposes .",
    "a lot of works have been done in the indirect precision constraints of the squark sector of the mssm , including the one - loop level feynman diagram calculation . to provide some new useful numerics here",
    "we consider the mssm higgs mass constraint in detail , in particular we solve the mixing term @xmath0 for the required sm like higgs mass .",
    "there are in general two solutions for a required sm like higgs mass , and we find the precision constraints are especially effective for the large @xmath0 branch .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : for ] , we briefly review the dimension-6 operator basis and the bosonic cde formulism , then we discuss the structure needed for large mass nondegeneracy .",
    "next in section  [ sec : sferm ] we show the sfermion sector input to the cde formulism , and then the main analytical results .",
    "section  [ sec : num ] is devoted to various numerical applications of the analytical results .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : dis ] . at last",
    ", appendix  [ sec : app ] provides a list of useful auxiliary formulas for the integration of feynman parameters .",

    "is generated as the most stringent one , while on the other side @xmath4 is suppressed and the @xmath13-@xmath14 symmetric @xmath6 takes over , but the @xmath4 parameter is still somehow competitive if @xmath16 is close to @xmath15 , especially for large @xmath0 and more aggressive experiments . in the first panel",
    "the constraints vanish at @xmath27 or @xmath28 of @xmath29 , that s the `` blind spot '' discussed in  @xcite . except for the blind spot , the constraint for the heavier stops will naively extend to large values , that s another interesting feature of the indirect constraint method .",
    "we have checked that the constraints depend very weakly with @xmath11 , which can be understood through the fact that it always comes in the @xmath30 factor of the small d - term .    in supersymmetric theories the sm like higgs mass is calculable , from the d - term tree level contribution and the large radiative corrections mainly from the top /",

    "for stop masses of a few tevs , the @xmath0 term needs to contribute significantly to tune the higgs mass to the measured @xmath1  gev , which predicts the @xmath0 to be a considerable value with roughly the same scaling with stop masses , potentially contributing significant @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms of the wilson coefficients .",

    "<S> we apply the covariant derivative expansion of the coleman - weinberg potential to the sfermion sector in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , matching it to the relevant dimension-6 operators in the standard model effective field theory at one - loop level . </S>",
    "<S> emphasis is paid to nondegenerate large soft supersymmetry breaking mass squares , and the most general analytical wilson coefficients are obtained for all pure bosonic dimension-6 operators . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the non - logarithmic contributions , they generally have another logarithmic contributions . </S>",
    "<S> various numerical results are shown , in particular the constraints in the large @xmath0 branch reproducing the @xmath1  gev higgs mass can be pushed to high values to almost completely probe the low stop mass region at the future fcc - ee experiment , even given the higgs mass calculation uncertainty .    </S>",
