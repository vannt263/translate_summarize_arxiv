    "in the treatise `` de magnete '' as early as 1600 , the english researcher gilbert showed the predominately dipolar character of the terrestrial magnetic field .",
    "next in the early nineteen century , other english researcher gauss improved the magnetic field observation techniques and introduced the spherical harmonic method for geomagnetic field analysis .",
    "based on a called `` spherical harmonic analysis '' , a mathematical method was developed to separate the external and the internal contributions to the surface field by a unique global analysis of the earth s main field ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the geomagnetic field is described as a complicated function of space and time .",
    "ground based magnetic measurements show a repetitive diurnal variation on geomagnetically quiet days .",
    "but there is a great variety of irregular variations that occur from time to time , the `` disturbance fields '' .",
    "periods of great disturbance are called , by analogy with the weather , `` magnetic storms '' @xcite .",
    "some evidence of the influence of oceanic tides on the magnetic daily variation has been obtained by .",
    "they found small semidiurnal variations of the z component at a coastal site ( cambria , california ) and at two island stations ( honolulu and san miguel ) that could not be explained by the atmospheric tidal theory .",
    "they suggested that these variations must be due predominantly to oceanic tides .",
    "it is important to mention here that the conductivity of the ocean does not vary significantly with time , unlike the ionospheric conductivity . as a consequence ,",
    "the seasonal variation of the oceanic contribution is expected to be smaller than the ionospheric contribution @xcite .    observed the geomagnetic contributions due to the moderate tsumani in the pacific ocean provoked by the chilean earthquake of @xmath0 in magnitude at three different magnetic stations ( ppt , hua and ipm ) .",
    "their observations presented a variation of @xmath1 in the vertical component of the magnetic field ( z ) during the time of the tsumani effects .",
    "movement of electrically conducting sea - water through the geomagnetic field generates an electromotive force that induces electric fields , currents and secondary magnetic fields . in other words",
    ", tsunamis can produce perturbations in the earth s magnetic field by electro - magnetic induction ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in this work",
    ", we focused on the survey of geomagnetic variations induced by some selected tsunamis : one of 26 december 2004 , other of 27 february 2010 and another of 11 march , 2011 . as the wavelet transforms had turn out to be a very useful tool in atmospheric signal analysis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the discrete wavelet technique have been selected and used with four levels of decomposition in order to detect the small singularities in the geomagnetic data . for a good revision on the application of discrete wavelet on space weather research , , and @xcite",
    "can be consulted .",
    "thus , this work aims to verify the use of the wavelet technique as a way to identify the effects related to tsunamis on the geomagnetic field components , particularly the z - component .",

    "faraday originally predicted that ocean waves could induce electrical fields , which are also called by  motional induction  .",
    "the induction mechanism process consists of the flow of the ocean water , as an electrically conducting fluid , through the earth s main magnetic field .",
    "the salts dissolved in the sea water are made of ions that can be deflected by the lorentz force which acts in a perpendicular direction both to the velocity and magnetic field vectors @xcite .",
    "as consequence of the motion of sea water with velocity @xmath2 across the geomagnetic field @xmath3 , a conduction current @xmath4 is produced expressed by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath7 is the stationary electric field and @xmath8 is the induced electric field . discarding any displacement current ,",
    "the ampere s law is used to determine an induced magnetic field @xmath9 given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that electric and magnetic fields are related by faraday s law given by : @xmath12    applying the same mathematical development used by , the velocity field present in the problem can be described as a curl of a vector stream function @xmath13 ( the stream understood as the flow of the ocean water ) , _ i.e. _ : @xmath14 in analogy , the induced magnetic field can be expressed by a vector potential @xmath15 , given by : @xmath16 thus the relation between the vector stream function @xmath13 and the geomagnetic field @xmath3 as a function of the vector potential @xmath15 can be established as : @xmath17    in a short description , the induced magnetic field generated by the ocean can be classified by two components : toroidal and poloidal .",
    "the toroidal component is generated by the electrical currents closing in the vertical plane and can reach up to @xmath18 but is confined to the ocean and the upper crust .",
    "the poloidal component is much weaker , between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and arises from the electrical currents closing in the horizontal plane , however it can reaches outside of the ocean to remote lands and satellite locations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the sea water is subject to two kinds of geomagnetic fluctuations : periodic ( lunar and solar variations ) and transient disturbances ( geomagnetic storms ) , as discussed by .",
    "also , the ocean flow can be occasionally disturbed by tsunamis that can increase the ocean wave speed for few centimeters per second and that affects the entire water column . consequently ,",
    "as demonstrated before , to increase the ocean flow will also increase the magnetic induced field .",
    "considering quiet conditions , discussed that the major difficulty to determine the magnetic ocean generated signals are the weak values compared to the signals from other sources .",
    "this is the reason to take advantage of some analysis features of the wavelet technique .",
    "the wavelet transforms were better and broadly formalized thanks to mathematicians , physicist , and engineers efforts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the domain of geophysics applications ,",
    "the main characteristic of the wavelet technique is the introduction of time - frequency decomposition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the wavelet transform can be used in the analysis of non - stationary signals to rescue information on the frequency or scale variations of those signals and to detect the localization of theirs structures in time and/or in space . due to the double localization property of the wavelet function",

    "related to the magnetic disturbance level , these events of tsunami occurrence happened during quiet time ( 27 february , 2010 ) and disturbed geomagnetic conditions ( weak - 26 december , 2004 , and moderate storms , 11 march , 2011 ) .",
