    "red giant stars present mixed modes , which behave as pressure modes in the convective envelope and as gravity modes in the radiative interior ( beck et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this mixed character allows to study the core of red giants .",
    "this is not the case for main - sequence stars , where gravity modes are confined in the inner radiative zone and evanescent in the convective envelope .",
    "red giants differ from main sequence stars because they have a very dense radiative core , where the brunt - visl  frequency reaches high values ( montalbn et al .",
    "moreover , the evanescent region between gravity and pressure mode resonant cavities is much narrower than in the case of main - sequence stars ( goupil et al .",
    "thus physical conditions in red giants are met to cause a coupling between pressure modes in the convective envelope and gravity modes in the radiative interior , giving birth to non - radial mixed modes .",
    "+ the study of red giant oscillation spectra led to the automatic measurement of many seismic parameters such as the large separation @xmath0 ( mosser et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the frequency of maximum power oscillation @xmath1 ( kallinger et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the gravity mode period spacing @xmath2 ( vrard et al .",
    "many information can be retrieved from these parameters .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 allows to determine stellar masses and radii with a precision between 4 to 8 % for the radius and 8 to 16 % for the mass ( kallinger et al .",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 provides the determination of stars evolutionary status : we can now distinguish between the subgiant phase , the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the red clump where stars burn their helium in their core , and the beginning of the asymptotic giant branch ( mosser et al .",
    "@xcite ) . +",
    "although the measurement of all these parameters is now entirely automated , this is not the case for the measurement of rotational splittings .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that mixed modes are not evenly spaced in frequency : pressure - dominated mixed modes are nearly equally spaced in frequency with a spacing close to the large separation @xmath0 , while gravity - dominated mixed modes are nearly equally spaced in period with a spacing close to the gravity mode period spacing @xmath2 ( mosser et al .",
    "red giant spectra exhibit numerous dipole mixed modes , which apparently form an inextricable mixed mode forest .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of mixed modes is used to identify the mixed mode pattern . in the case of rapid core rotation , it is however difficult to disentangle the frequency spacings between two consecutive mixed modes from the rotational splittings in frequency oscillation spectra .",
    "+ measurements of the mean core rotation were manually obtained for about 300 red giants ( mosser et al .",
    "they showed that a very efficient angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope is at work in red giants .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for this transport is still not yet fully understood .",
    "mean core rotation measurements for a red giant set as large as possible are therefore needed to constrain the nature of this mechanism .",
    "+ in this work , we detail the principle of the method developed in order to obtain automated measurements of the mean core rotation of red giants .",
    "we aim at validating it for stars on the rgb , for which automated measurements are fully consistent with manual measurements ( mosser et al .",
    "such automated measurements are essential to pave the way for the future analysis of plato mission data , with a potential as high as half a million red giants .",
    "the first step of the method consists in stretching the frequency spectra , which provides spectra where mixed modes are now regularly spaced with a spacing close to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , frequencies are changed into stretched periods @xmath3 through the differential equation ( mosser et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath4 the @xmath5 function is defined by @xmath6}{\\cos^2 \\displaystyle{\\left(\\pi \\frac{\\nu - { \\nu{_{\\mathrm{p}}}}}{{\\delta\\nu}}\\right ) } } \\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the coupling parameter of mixed modes , @xmath2 is the gravity mode period spacing , @xmath0 is the large separation , @xmath8 are the pure dipole gravity mode frequencies , @xmath9 are the pure pressure mode frequencies . + for the pure dipole gravity mode frequencies @xmath8 we can use the first - order asymptotic expansion ( tassoul @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gravity radial order usually defined as a negative value , and @xmath12 is a small but complicated function sensitive to the stratification near the boundary between the radiative core and the convective envelope . + for the pure dipole pressure mode frequencies @xmath9 we use the universal red giant oscillation pattern ( mosser et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath13 ^ 2 \\right ) { \\delta\\nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the pressure radial order , @xmath15 is the pressure mode offset , @xmath16 is the small separation , @xmath17 represents the curvature of the oscillation pattern , and @xmath18 is the non - integer order at the frequency @xmath1 of maximum oscillation signal .",
    "in the stretched spectra , rotation induces a small departure from an evenly spaced pattern .",
    "the stretched period spacing between rotational multiplet components with the same azimuthal order @xmath19 expresses ( mosser et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath20 it presents a small departure from @xmath2 , expressed by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the rotational splitting induced by the mean rotation of the radiative core .",
    "+ in the case of rapid core rotation , this equation can be used to characterize the crossing of the multiplet components and to infer @xmath22 ( gehan et al .",
    "@xcite ) . when @xmath23 for slow rotation , a relevant approximation of @xmath24 is given by ( mosser et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of gravity modes per @xmath0-wide frequency range , defined as @xmath27 it is then possible to build chelle diagrams based on this stretched period @xmath3 , where the different components of the rotational multiplet draw ridges and are disentangled ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "hence , it is easy to obtain measurements of the mean core rotation .",
    "the number of ridges that are visible depends on the stellar inclination . only the ridge associated to the azimuthal order",
    "@xmath28 is visible if the star is seen pole - on , whereas the two components @xmath29 are visible when the star is seen equator - on , and finally all the three components @xmath30 are visible for intermediate inclinations .",
    "+ in the case of rapid core rotation , the ridges overlap in the chelle diagram , and the frequency where the crossing occurs together with the knowledge of the @xmath2 parameter provide a precise estimate of the mean core rotation value ( gehan et al .",
    "@xcite ) .     as a function of @xmath3 modulo @xmath2 for the star kic 6144777 .",

    "red lines represent the automatic identification of each component through the hough transform.,width=359 ]",
    ") space ( top left ) is represented by a sinusoid in the hough space ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) ( top right ) .",
    "points which are aligned in the ( @xmath34 ) space ( middle and bottom left ) are represented by sinusoids which all intersect at the same ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) values in the hough space ( middle and bottom right ) .",
    "thus a line is characterized by a couple of ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) values . ]",
    "we aim at identifying the ridges corresponding to the different rotational multiplet components ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ) . according to equation  [ dtaum ] , these ridges are nearly vertical in a stretched chelle diagram .",
    "the measurement of the rotation can be derived from the identification of these lines , in the form of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the cartesian coordinates of the points , @xmath38 is the slope and @xmath39 is the intercept of the line . detecting lines using the previous equation proves to be problematic for lines which are almost vertical . in such cases",
    ", the slope tends towards infinity and the determination of the slope and the intercept is highly imprecise .",
    "the hough transform allows to get around this problem through the use of the polar coordinates ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) that characterize the position and orientation of the line ( figure  [ fig-2 ] ) : @xmath33 corresponds to the angle between the line which is perpendicular to the alignment that we consider and the x - axis , @xmath32 represents the distance between the alignment that we consider and the origin .",
    "the hough transform is particularly useful to detect the different ridges drawn by red giant core rotation in chelle diagrams , which are quasi vertical .",
    "+ the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is : @xmath40 for an isolated point , the @xmath33 angle may take all possible values between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "a point have fixed ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) values and is thus represented by a sinusoid in the hough space ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) ( figure  [ fig-2 ] top ) . if several points are aligned on the same line , the corresponding sinusoids all intersect at the same ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) coordinates in the hough space ( figure  [ fig-2 ] middle and bottom ) .",
    "therefore , detecting lines in the ( @xmath34 ) space is equivalent to detect intersections in the hough space . in practice",
    ", the algorithm looks for points which are almost aligned and almost vertical in chelle diagrams to identify in an automated way the different ridges .",
    "+ from the hough parameters , we can derive the mean core rotation , since the angle @xmath33 used in the hough transform is linked to @xmath24 by @xmath43 the correction to the @xmath2 gravity mode spacing induced by rotation in stretched spectra is small .",
    "in practice , @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 . hence , we have the direct relation @xmath46 from which we can derive @xmath22 .",

    "we applied this method to eight red giants .",
    "the obtained measurements are resumed in table 1 . with the use of the hough",
    "transform , we could obtain core rotational splitting measurements with a relative uncertainty on the order of a few percents .",
    "the sample represents seven rgb stars and a red giant which is transiting to the clump phase ( figure  [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "rgb stars are located very close to the confusion limit in frequency between the rotational splitting @xmath47 and the spacing between consecutive mixed modes ( mosser et al .",
    "that means that the rotational splitting and the mixed - mode frequency spacing sometimes overlap for rgb stars . thus measuring the mean core rotation in rgb stars",
    "is particularly difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we could obtain automatic measurements for stars in this evolutionary stage . in these conditons , obtaining automatic measurements of the mean core rotation of red clump stars will be easier providing that we develop a method which would be more appropriate to their lower core rotation values .",

    "we developed a largely automated method to measure the mean core rotation and validated it on rgb stars , where large rotational splittings lead to complicated frequency oscillation spectra .",
    "the entire automation of red giant core rotation measurement is in progress , and we aim at obtaining mean core rotation measurements for thousands of red giants observed by _",
    "kepler _ in the near future .",
    "these measurements will be essential to pave the way for the future analysis of plato data , with potentially 500 000 red giants .",
