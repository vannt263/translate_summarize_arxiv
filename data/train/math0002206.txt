    "in particular examples that i considered there existed a @xmath4 subspace whose measure was determined by the components of a second vector in a higher dimensional subspace .",
    "i proposed that the measure in the @xmath4 subspace be identified with the norm of the vector in the higher dimensional subspace . in this way",
    "both a vector space and its norm are viewed as residing in particular subspaces of a given direct product algebra @xmath5 in this construction the signature of the metric arises intrinsically from the particular underlying finite group algebra .",
    "the realization of clifford algebras in terms of underlying finite group algebras is described by salingaros @xcite .",
    "the present work differs from the approaches of , e.g. , hestenes , lounesto , and greider @xcite by considering vector spaces obtained through the decomposition of a direct product algebra ( having elements of form @xmath6 rather than through a decomposition of a clifford algebra . in particular cases that i consider , however , the underlying finite group algebra ( containing elements @xmath7 does correspond to a clifford algebra .",

    "the extension of this construction to higher dimensional cases is also straightforward ; however , the multiplicity of subspaces in the corresponding direct product algebras makes the interpretation of the overall structure more challenging , and it has not been fully addressed by this author .    in section 2 ,",
