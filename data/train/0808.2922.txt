    "models of food web structure fall into several distinct classes .",
    "early models tended to be either static , where links were assigned between species according to some rule , or dynamic , but where the dynamics consisted of population dynamics on a random network .",
    "examples of the former are the cascade @xcite and niche @xcite models , and of the latter the work of @xcite .",
    "more recent approaches have incorporated longer time scales , allowing for the introduction of new species through immigration or speciation and for species extinction .",
    "this allows the web structure to build up over time ; the structure of the web emerges rather than being put in by hand .",
    "the two ways of doing this have been through assembly models , which introduce new species into the community from a species pool @xcite , and evolutionary models , which introduce new species through modification of existing species ",
    "speciation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to unify these two approaches by constructing a species pool through an evolutionary dynamics and then using this to assemble communities .",
    "assembly and evolutionary models both have two , separated , time - scales . on the ecological time - scale the population sizes of the species in the community change according to the equations of the population dynamics until they eventually reach a fixed point or some other attractor . on a longer time - scale species",
    "are introduced through immigration ( assembly models ) or by speciation ( evolutionary models ) .",
    "the new species then competes with the existing species following the equations of the population dynamics until the system again reaches equilibrium .",
    "if the new species does not immediately go extinct , it may either coexist with those species present at its introduction , or may cause one or more extinctions , potentially resulting in its own extinction .",
    "the population dynamics takes the form of differential equations for the population numbers ( using , for instance , lotka - volterra , holling type ii , or ratio - dependent functional responses ) and so the extinction threshold has to be specified .",
    "typically this is set to be such that if the population of any particular species falls below 1 , it is deemed to be extinct .",
    "assembly models usually consist of species pools of tens of species which are labelled as `` plants '' , `` herbivores '' , `` carnivores '' , etc .",
    "the interactions between these various trophic levels are typically assigned by some rule with a large amount of randomness built in , but body - size considerations may also be used to decide the predator - prey relationships . early work used numerical integration of lotka - volterra equations , combined with the criterion of local stability @xcite , although this had some problems @xcite , and other methods of deciding whether a particular community is stable have been used @xcite .",
    "species assembly models are capable of generating reasonably - sized food webs @xcite through immigration , although the species pool is made up of species which are randomly assigned rather than having co - evolved , and as such it is very artificial .",
    "moreover , only very simple population dynamics have been investigated , underlining the overall lack of realism of this approach .",
    "evolutionary models have been developed during the last decade or so .",
    "species and their interactions may be specified by traits which define phenotypic or behavioural characteristics @xcite , or the strength of interaction between species may be described through matrices @xcite .",
    "additional mechanisms , such as adaptive foraging , may be included and may add stability to the system @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary approach starts from a small number of species and , through the modification of existing species , is capable of generating large webs .",
    "the choice of population dynamics seems to be important @xcite , with the simplest types of population dynamics , such as lotka - volterra , being unable to lead to communities with large stable webs .",
    "a disadvantage of evolutionary models is that it is not clear what community is being constructed ; it seems to be one in which immigration has played no part .",
    "a more consistent viewpoint would be to use the community constructed through the evolutionary approach as a species pool in the sense of the assembly model , and then use these co - evolved species to create food webs which would be more analogous to those for which data is collected .",
    "this will be the point of view we adopt here .",
    "the idea of using a pool of species as a source of immigrants for colonisation goes back many years and was the central feature of the theory of island biogeography developed in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "there the pool was called the `` mainland '' and the community of interest the `` island '' , and this is the terminology we will adopt here .",
    "that theory was an equilibrium theory ; it assumed that immigration and local extinctions were in balance , although with continual overturn of species .",
    "although there have been calls for this theory to be updated and extended @xcite , there has been little work trying to do so using recent developments in modelling tools and techniques .",
    "a notable exception is the work of hubbell @xcite which uses the mainland / island picture to formulate a neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity .",
    "one way to view the work we describe here is as a generalisation of these ideas to predator - prey interactions , incorporating many other aspects and leading to food webs with several trophic levels .    in the following section we reiterate the webworld mathematical model presented in @xcite , which was used to generate the simulation results presented in this paper . in previous papers @xcite",
    "this model has been used to construct food webs through evolution of the species present .",
    "we discuss the modifications used to study the effect of food web construction through immigration . in our main results",
    "section we examine typical measures of food webs structure in terms of the resources available to the system , and in terms of the number of species present .",
    "we then focus on the species - area relation as a composite measure of food web behaviour , and examine our results in terms of power - law fitting .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results we have obtained and possible directions for future work .",
    "the webworld model was introduced by @xcite to link ecological modelling of food web structure with evolutionary dynamics of species creation . a refinement to the population dynamics was introduced by @xcite , and it is this model , described in detail below , which we adopt .",
    "the long - term behaviour of the model , identified by @xcite , is for a continual overturn of species to occur with relatively well defined mean values of such quantities as the number of species present .",
    "the webworld model constructs food webs from species defined by a set , @xmath0 , of ten different attributes which represent phenotypic and behavioural characteristics pertaining to survival .",
    "initially an antisymmetric matrix @xmath1 is randomly generated to indicate the relative score of pairs of attributes ; the relative score of two species is defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is chosen to give scores @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 then species @xmath6 is capable of feeding on species @xmath7 .",
    "the utility of this system of defining species is that incremental evolution can occur by changing one attribute of a member of a selected species to form a new species , whose scores will be similar to those of the parent species .",
    "species are numbered such that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of species present .",
    "each species has population @xmath10 subject to the population dynamics .",
    "one special species is created , denoted as species zero , whose population is fixed at @xmath11 .",
    "this species represents the environment , the basic food source supplying the whole food web .",
    "the value @xmath12 is the effective population of the environmental resources , which provides a persistent food source for the food web as a whole .",
    "a value of @xmath13 was chosen to grow a source community with approximately 100 species , and hence this value of @xmath12 is an approximate upper bound for models utilising this source community .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath12 used for evolving communities was prescribed by computational resources .    in the evolutionary model , the first species is created with a random set of attributes such that its score against the environment species is non - zero .",
    "were this not the case , the first species would go extinct , being unable to feed .",
    "subsequent species are introduced by taking one extant species as the parent , and altering one attribute to create a daughter species of population 1 .",
    "no attribute is allowed to repeat within a single species .",
    "the food web is constructed by repetition of this speciation mechanism , with extinctions determined by the population dynamics described below .",
    "the decision to introduce new species with population 1 is arbitrary except that this is the smallest population which does not lead to immediate extinction .",
    "the population dynamics is described by a balance equation for the numerical gains and losses of each species .",
    "this is written as @xmath14 where the three terms on the right - hand side correspond respectively to gains from foraging , losses to predation , and losses to natural death .",
    "the factor @xmath15 between losses to a prey species and gains to its predator reflects the ecological efficiency of the system , and we adopt a value of @xmath16 consistent with empirical data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assign the scaling factor of natural death , @xmath17 , to be unity for all species , thus fixing the time - scale of the model .",
    "the remaining term , @xmath18 , comprises the functional response .",
    "we adopt a ratio - dependent functional response that relates to a foraging strategy ; @xmath19 is the fractional effort species @xmath6 puts into potential prey @xmath7 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the functional response is given by @xmath21 for very small predator populations this is approximately @xmath22 so @xmath23 can be seen to restrict the feeding rate with high prey availability .",
    "a value of @xmath24 has been adopted from @xcite , where it was found to give suitably realistic food webs .",
    "the sum in the denominator reflects the effect of competition .",
    "competition is maximal between members of the same species , for which @xmath25 for all @xmath6 .",
    "competition with other species is weaker , indicating the greater ability to extract resources from a prey species given by a diversity of feeding techniques .",
    "the formula for @xmath26 we also adopt from @xcite as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fraction of attributes shared by @xmath6 and @xmath29 .",
    "it can therefore be seen that @xmath26 has a minimum value of @xmath30 for two dissimilar species ; we adopt the value of @xmath31 , which has been shown to produce reasonable food webs .",
    "@xcite show that there exists an evolutionarily stable strategy for @xmath32 given by @xmath33 which we therefore take to yield the strategy for each species at all times .    to maintain a limited size community , and in particular to give meaning to the system size parameter @xmath12 ,",
    "species are removed from the community if their population falls below unity . from ( [ eq : g ] ) it can be seen that all values of @xmath18 are unchanged if all populations @xmath10 are changed by the same factor . as such",
    ", if all @xmath34 are zero , ( [ eq : n ] ) shows that this will still be the case after scaling all @xmath10 .",
    "hence all dynamics of the food web are unchanged if both @xmath12 and the extinction threshold are scaled by the same factor , and the arbitrary choice of unity population for extinction is of no consequence . in the absence of a non - zero extinction threshold",
    "no extinctions ever occur , since populations will at worst exponentially decay towards zero .",

    "the exact number of species would change on short timescales as evolution and extinction events balance only on average .",
    "this size of web was chosen to give a reasonably large set of species for immigration without taking excessive computational time to reach the steady state .    to construct an island community ,",
    "the model was initialised with the same matrix @xmath1 and environment species as the source community , but a value of @xmath12 that was in general different .",
    "species were introduced from the source community in a random order ; the speciation mechanism by which new species are introduced in the mainland model is not used , so the number of species that can co - exist on any island is limited by the number of species in the source community .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 was used as the independent variable to investigate the effect of resource availability on the nature of the food web constructed .    for comparison with the effects of @xmath12 on the nature of the food web constructed through immigration ,",
    "mainlands were created for a range of values of @xmath12 by the same process as the source community , using the same matrix @xmath1 and environment species .",
    "different mainlands were isolated in the sense that the species subject to population dynamics were unrelated between mainland instances .",
    "a second line of comparison comes from taking the source community and performing population dynamics while gradually reducing @xmath12 from its initial value .",

    "continuously varying quantities , such as the total population of all species , were found to rapidly converge on this mean as the number of runs increased , implying a statistical similarity of the food webs generated .",
    "results are shown for the range of resources @xmath58 ; the lower bound was chosen because typically only one or two species were found in the resultant food web , with very small total populations .",
    "the behaviour of food webs under formation as they approach the limit in which only one species is supported , and that near extinction , is of little interest ; in any case a model using non - stochastic population dynamics is inappropriate in this regime .",
    "the upper limit of the resource range is determined by the number of species in the source community ; as resources in the immigrant community increase , the number of species present approaches that of the source , and the other measured characteristics saturate also .",
    "saturation also occurs in time , measured by the number of immigration events that have occurred , and the samples examined were taken after 500 immigration events .",
    "for the largest values of resources there was some systematic change at later times as the last few species were assimilated into the food web .    in figure",
    "[ fig : immigrate]a ) we plot the simplest measure of success in assembling a food web from immigrant species , which is the number of those species simultaneously present at the moment of measurement . as @xmath12 increases , almost all species are able to invade the island , which suggests that the process of assembling a community in this way is quite efficient .",
    "a second simple feature to calculate from a known food web is the number of trophic levels , plotted in figure  [ fig : immigrate]b ) .",
    "here we use strictly defined trophic levels equivalent to counting the number of feeding links in the shortest route from each species to the environment on which all basal species feed .",
    "thus all species feeding on the environment  basal species  are in trophic level 1 , species which feed on basal species but not directly on the environment are in trophic level 2 , and so forth .",
    "the number of trophic levels in any particular web is a measurement of the highest single species , and thus is an integer .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : immigrate]b ) shows the mean value of this quantity over simulation runs , and hence is not necessarily integer .",
    "it can immediately be seen that the formation of food webs with multiple trophic levels does occur when species are supplied by immigration from a previously evolved food web .",
    "we note that the increase in the number of trophic levels with @xmath12 is not smooth , and that for certain ranges of resources , essentially all webs have the same number of trophic levels .",
    "for example , in the range @xmath59 the mean number of trophic levels is almost exactly 2 , and a similar plateau occurs at a mean trophic level of 3 .",
    "the transition from a single trophic level to two is particularly sharp , with the onset of higher trophic levels being spread over a larger range of resources .",
    "vertical bands in figure  [ fig : immigrate ] mark the periods of transition between trophic levels , and the first transition can be seen to correspond to a rapid increase in the number of species present .",
    "examination of individual food webs suggests that this occurs when ` herbivores ' , which feed on the basal ` plants ' , enter the system .",
    "a herbivorous species reduces the success of the plants on which it feeds , which in turn allows other plants to compete for resources effectively .",
    "the webworld model thus displays predator - mediated coexistence . for slightly larger @xmath12 figure  [ fig : immigrate]a )",
    "shows a plateau in the number of species present before an approximately power law increase in @xmath60 sets in .",
    "figure  [ fig : immigrate]b ) also plots , as dashed lines , the average trophic level .",
    "the upper dashed line indicates the mean trophic level of a species in the food web , which increases more smoothly than the number of trophic levels . a new trophic level is founded by a single species ; as the population of the species on which it feeds increase , it becomes possible to support a greater number of species on the top level , and hence the mean trophic level increases while the number of distinct levels is constant .",
    "the lower dashed line indicates the mean trophic level of individuals in the food web , and is lower than the mean by species since the population of species tends to decrease with increasing trophic level . to examine this curve",
    "more closely it has been re - plotted as the dotted line against the right - hand axis . here",
    "it can be seen that there is a maximum in this quantity immediately after the onset of the second trophic level .",
    "thereafter the population of basal species increases more rapidly than for other trophic levels , and @xmath51 decreases asymptotically .",
    "this is related to the result plotted in figure  [ fig : immigrate]c ) , which shows that after the onset of the second trophic level , the number of individuals summed over all species is nearly a constant fraction of @xmath12 . considering the case of a single species feeding on the environment , we can identify its population by setting the time derivative in ( [ eq : n ] ) to zero and substituting @xmath61 in ( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "for a given value of @xmath9 , this can be used to deduce the population of the species to be @xmath62 and hence can not exceed 0.1 for our value of @xmath15 .",
    "the larger value of @xmath63 seen at the left of figure  [ fig : immigrate]c ) corresponds to the presence of multiple basal species , where the reduced inter - specific competition allows a larger total population .",
    "the steady value of @xmath63 for multiple - trophic level webs seems to be an effect of food web regulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : immigrate]d ) shows the fraction of species that are basal ( solid line ) , and the fraction that are unpredated ( dashed line ) .",
    "the fraction of basal species falls steadily as resources increase and more species are able to find niches at higher trophic levels .",
    "the fraction of top species , i.e. those that are unpredated , has a remarkably different behaviour , dropping to an almost constant level as soon as trophic structure exists .",
    "as new species find a niche in the food web they have small population and are likely to be unpredated , but at the same time typically find that niche by feeding on a species that was previously unpredated .",
    "as @xmath12 increases , all species present typically increase in population , and at some point a top species becomes an exploitable prey .",

    "the first diversity index we show is the commonly used shannon index of the system , with values here based on the natural logarithm .",

    "an important difference between the bci data and our simulation results is that the former comprises a single trophic level .",

    "this is similar to our simulation results with a similar number of basal species .",
    "the sudden increase in @xmath40 , and drop in the simpson index @xmath42 , during the formation of the second trophic level correspond to the increasing number of basal species which partition the total basal population .",

    "averages in figure  [ fig : evolve ] are over one hundred runs for the solid lines , as with the island results , but are averages over only ten runs for the dotted lines corresponding to larger @xmath12 .",
    "it was noticed that the results of averaging over even one hundred simulation runs were particularly poor in the range of resources marked by the central vertical band in figure  [ fig : evolve ] , which manifests itself as a large variation in most quantities plotted within this range .",
    "this effect can be seen most clearly in figure  [ fig : evolve]g ) , the simpson index @xmath42 , which appears to be in transition between two values marked by dotted lines .",
    "the main cause of these fluctuations is related to the number of webs possessing different number of species , with @xmath9 for an individual mainland web in the range @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "the most obvious difference between the results for a food web grown through evolution when compared to the island food webs is that there are no longer distinct boundaries corresponding to the onset of trophic levels .",
    "when plotted against @xmath9 in figure  [ fig : evolves]a ) there appears to be a relatively sharp onset of the third trophic level , but these data are averages over only ten realisations , and may be unreliable . compared with island food webs , the onset of trophic levels is at larger @xmath12 and , as shown in figure  [ fig : evolves]a ) , also larger @xmath9 .",
    "the left and right vertical bands in figure  [ fig : evolve ] mark the onset of the second and third trophic levels respectively in island food webs , and mainland food webs do not begin to attain those levels until the right - hand edge of the corresponding band .",
    "we hypothesise that for small @xmath12 , where island communities support more species than mainlands , the effect of species adapting to their predators and prey makes it more difficult to attain high trophic levels .",

    "as remarked , for @xmath75 an island community supports more species than a mainland ; the dashed line in figure  [ fig : evolve]a ) repeats the curve for islands shown in figure  [ fig : immigrate]a ) .",
    "as species evolve to become better at feeding on their prey and avoiding their predators , they tend to reduce the population of those species until they in turn evolve . as such , for small @xmath12 it is easier for one species to eliminate another from the food web , and the steady state number of species is smaller . as @xmath12 increases",
    ", the availability of new species to an island diminishes , whereas for a mainland the amount of novelty possible increases with @xmath9 leading to a potentially unbounded value of @xmath9 as @xmath76 .",

    "a striking difference between island and mainland food webs appears in the fraction of top species , shown in figure  [ fig : evolve]d ) as the dashed line . for island food",
    "webs the fraction of top species is small and nearly constant for food webs of multiple trophic levels , whereas for mainland communities it decreases gradually toward zero from a higher starting point .",
    "this probably reflects the potential for new species to enter the food web specialising in previously unpredated species , while in the island community species are constrained by their existing abilities .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in comparing the number of links per species between island and mainland food webs , it is found that the differences shown in figure  [ fig : evolves]d ) are neither large nor systematic . as such",
    "it seems that the number of feeding links a species possesses is primarily dictated by the number of species in the ecosystem as a whole , with relatively minor contributions from probable influences such as the trophic structure and direct consequences of assembly .",
    "diversity indices @xmath40 and @xmath42 , shown in figures  [ fig : evolves]e ) and [ fig : evolves]f ) respectively , also show a behaviour that is largely similar for island and mainland communities .",
    "there is an initial increase in diversity which is nearly linear in terms of @xmath40 versus @xmath65 , turning down for @xmath82 .",
    "this later decrease in the derivative is probably related to the fact that species are increasingly added at higher trophic levels where the population is automatically smaller ; @xmath40 is maximised by a uniform distribution .",
    "the strongest difference between the diversity of island and mainland communities occurs at @xmath80 , where there is an anomalous excess in @xmath40 for islands .",
    "the maximum difference coincides with the sharply emerging difference in the fraction of basal species shown in figure  [ fig : evolves]c ) , and is presumably related . for @xmath40 to be higher in island communities when most species are basal indicates that there is a more even distribution of population between those basal species .",
    "the rapid increase in the fraction of species on the second trophic level diminishes @xmath40 by the previously noted effect of population decreasing with level , restoring equality between island and mainland food webs .",
    "the number of species in the single reduction process from the island source community necessarily starts at 103 for @xmath13 , corresponding to the source community itself . for this value of resources the island community does not generally reach the full compliment of species , and the mean value is considerably lower .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : reduce]a ) , as resources decrease species drop out of the reducing food web gradually rather than triggering catastrophic losses , and the number of species in the reducing food web is larger than the number in the immigrant community for all @xmath12 despite the limitation that species can not be reintroduced .",
    "the limitation that we have only one possible history to examine means that there is an integer number of trophic levels for all @xmath12 in the reduction model ( non - integer values plotted in figure  [ fig : reduce]b ) lie between sample points ) , so plateaux are an inevitability .",
    "these plateaux roughly correspond to the ranges for which plateaux are seen in the corresponding results for island food webs , shown in figure  [ fig : immigrate]b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : reduces]a ) shows that the island communities tend to have more trophic levels for the number of species than the reduction model , although as mentioned they have fewer species for a given @xmath12 .    in general the trends seen in the reduction model",
    "are very similar to those seen in the island food webs .",
    "the fraction of basal species in the island and reduction webs approach each other for large @xmath9 ; for small @xmath9 this fraction tends to unity more rapidly as @xmath12 decreases for the reduction model , possibly reflecting a tendency to preferentially remove non - basal species .",
    "the difference seems to relate to the trophic structure shown in figure  [ fig : reduces]a ) , and might be removed if reintroduction of species were allowed in the reduction model .",
    "measurements of @xmath36 and @xmath53 shown in figures  [ fig : reduces]b ) and [ fig : reduces]d ) respectively are less smooth for the reduction model due to the absence of averaging , but are otherwise consistent . the small increase in the shannon index of the reduction model over islands , shown in figure  [ fig : reduces]e ) ,",
    "is probably related to a preference for removing species of higher trophic level , thus making the average species more like a basal species in population and increasing uniformity .",

    "one of the most studied features related to the effect of size on food web structure is the species - area relation ( sar ) , because this is relatively easy to sample for real systems .",
    "we model the sar by equating area to resources , @xmath12 , with which we supply basal species , and examine the equilibrium number of species for food webs grown with different values of @xmath12 .",
    "several distinct types of sar can be formed depending on the sampling method ; that applicable to our data was labelled as the type iv species - area curve by @xcite , corresponding to sampling of physically distinct regions ( islands or other isolated units ) of differing area .",
    "@xcite prefer to reserve the term `` species - area curve '' for just this case , but see @xcite and @xcite for further discussion .",
    "although a monotonic increase in @xmath9 with area is intuitive for any sar , it is not a necessary consequence of the type iv sampling method ; large islands may in principle have fewer species than smaller islands .",
    "some of the effects found in real ecosystems which influence the shape of the sar are not applicable to the data we collect on webworld .",
    "in particular , @xcite discusses three reasons to expect more species in a larger sample area .",
    "firstly , a larger sample area may imply a larger number of collected individuals , giving a more complete sample .",
    "for webworld we have complete population information at any time in the simulation , and in particular can distinguish with accuracy whether a species is present or absent .",
    "the second effect relates to diversity of habitats ; a larger area in a physical system is likely to contain heterogeneous regions to which different species are better adapted .",
    "the webworld model has only a single habitat type independent of the ` area ' we attribute to that system , and additional niches only arise through the existence of exploitable populations of other species .",
    "the third factor discussed in complicating sars measured from real data is the existence of biogeographical provinces ; a very large system may contain areas which could be occupied by the same set of species except for historical exclusion .",
    "examples abound of apparently identical niches being filled by different species in isolated regions .",
    "since the webworld model we use is only implicitly spatial , no such geographical barriers exist to maintain diversity , and this explanation for an increase in species count with area can also be excluded .",
    "@xcite contests the findings of @xcite that the number of species increases with area for a homogeneous environment , indicating that fisher s diversity index , @xmath26 , does not systematically depend on area for their samples . as shown in figures  [ fig : immigrate]f ) , [ fig : evolve]f ) and [ fig : reduce]f ) , our results show a significant trend in @xmath26 with area .",
    "we conclude that in our results the increase in species number with area is not merely due to changes in the cut - off population of otherwise similar distributions . for the smallest food webs this is particularly obvious in the food web structure , since the coexistence of basal species ( ` plants ' ) is strongly promoted by the presence of a single ` herbivorous ' species .",
    "the method of immigration we have used in the context of the webworld model is similar to the premise of the theory of island biogeography by @xcite .",
    "however , the population dynamics in webworld is deterministic , so between the introduction of species the population of each species settles to a steady value , and hence the rate of extinction becomes zero .",
    "as such , extinctions are related to the displacement of species by new arrivals rather than through fluctuations per se .",
    "it is still the case that those species driven extinct are those unable to adopt a feeding strategy that will support an equilibrium population above our extinction threshold .    .",

    "a power law fit to the data is acceptable for all @xmath12 greater than some threshold , indicated by arrows in figure  [ fig : sar ] .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath9 with area for small @xmath12 is discussed in the results section .",
    "power law indices for the immigration and reduction models are similar , whereas the evolution model has a rather steeper power law .",
    "@xcite attributes the degree of fitting of observed sars to the form @xmath84 for constants @xmath85 , @xmath86 and area @xmath0 to sampling effects in small food webs ; @xcite note that the sar including large islands is only well fitted by a power law , despite their conclusion that a logarithmic increase is a better description overall .",
    "the shape of the sar identified by @xcite is tri - phasic ; @xmath87 is larger for both small and large areas than for the range of area between .",
    "although we see anomalous behaviour for small areas in the webworld results , we can not associate a power law with these results since we do not see a straight line in the log - log plot . @xcite collect examples of typical power law indices in their table 1 , which have the approximate range @xmath88 , consistent with our results for the island and reduction models , which have @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "the power law index we find for the mainland model exceeds this range somewhat , at @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite describes the part of the tri - phasic curve corresponding to the largest areas as the ` continental ' scale , where diversity is attributable to evolutionary processes .",
    "values for @xmath87 as high as unity are possible for intercontinental scales ; @xmath92 would be found if two sample areas of equal size and no overlap in species were considered .",
    "@xcite cites examples of data from which species - area curves with @xmath92 can be extracted , corresponding to large length scales .    a different context within which a high power law index @xmath87 is found for the species - area relation was identified by @xcite , who study the changing sar during stages of succession on mount st .",
    "helens following volcanic sterilisation .",
    "@xcite found that the power law index of the sar decreased with time as species became re - established , and in their figure  2 present the sar of abraham plains for 1988 in which @xmath93 .",
    "we hypothesise that the large value of @xmath87 we find for mainland data may be due to internal disruption caused to the food web structure by the overturn of species , noting that in small food webs one effect of this overturn is to remove specialised predators whose prey becomes replaced .",
    "a system in which evolution and immigration were both allowed to play a part would be expected to display a power law index intermediate between those found for our immigration and evolution models , and be consistent with the concept of lessened disruption .",
    "in this paper we make use of the webworld model introduced by @xcite and @xcite to examine food web assembly through immigration .",
    "previous work on this topic , in particular assembly models @xcite , have drawn immigrant species from a randomly assigned species pool , and as such their results may not reflect the properties of a natural ecosystem . instead we create the species pool itself by evolution , and draw species from this stable community to construct ` island ' food webs , where in this discussion we use the term ` island ' to relate to ecosystems constructed solely by immigration .",
    "food webs constructed solely through evolution in situ we designate ` mainland ' . in order to compare our results with measurements of real ecosystems we equate the resources supplying the webworld model to physical area , noting that not being explicitly spatial , webworld can only represent systems without geographical barriers .    ) ; dotted line immigration ; dashed line evolution . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is of interest to study food webs assembled through immigration not only because these correspond to most of the real world ecosystems for which data is available , and especially to any experimental set - up which could be created , but also because from a modelling point of view the assembly of food webs through immigration is much more repeatable than the evolutionary scenario , in which the identity of the species is necessarily a chance occurrence .",
    "for each food web grown through evolution we can in shorter time examine the statistical properties of the family of island communities which can be grown from it .",
    "one of the clearest differences between island and mainland food webs is the power law index of the species - area relation . for our islands",
    "we find this to be , at @xmath89 , within the range found for natural ecosystems , typically @xmath94 .",
    "for our mainland results we find the steeper power law of @xmath95 , and note that a steeper power law in nature is associated with the very largest length scales , where evolution is more important than immigration due to the presence of substantial geographical barriers .",
    "it is difficult to obtain a species - area relation for real ecosystems in which only evolution played a role because these would need to correspond to regions sufficiently small to promote complete mixing and sufficiently remote to avoid immigration from a continent , yet numerous enough to provide good statistics for essentially similar environments .",
    "we note that a high power law may also be associated with a strongly perturbed system , e.g. @xcite , and that the continual turnover of species through evolution may provide such a disturbance .",
    "a second significant difference between island and mainland food webs is found in the fraction of basal and of top species . for island food webs the fraction of top ( unpredated ) species does not change systematically over a large range of system size , or equivalently as a function of the number of species .",
    "for mainlands with a large number of species ( @xmath96 ) there are far fewer top species than on islands .",
    "conversely islands have a smaller fraction of basal species than mainlands in our results . considering the progression of food webs from small area to large , we observe that islands show distinct plateaux in the number of trophic levels , with all islands having the same number of levels for large ranges of area .",
    "mainland food webs may show a weaker tendency toward this phenomenon , but we can not exclude a smooth increase in the mean number of levels with area across realisations .    despite these important differences , much of the behaviour of the model is essentially similar whether immigration or evolution supplies the species .",
    "in particular the number of trophic levels is close for islands and mainlands of similar area , and the number of feeding links per species is also very similar , implying statistical similarities between the food webs constructed .",
    "such similarities are reflected in the shannon index of the system , which increases nearly linearly in @xmath9 for small food webs , with a decrease in the gradient for @xmath96 .",
    "the shannon index is associated with the distribution of population sizes , which we will examine in a future paper .",
    "several avenues of future work are suggested by the results we have found .",
    "we have performed preliminary work in which immigration takes place along a chain of islands , with immigration to one island only being possible from its predecessor in the chain .",
    "our results to date suggest that this induces changes in the nature of the food webs several links down the chain , with a ` filtering ' effect precluding the transmission of species which can be easily displaced .",
    "similar scenarios reminiscent of real archipelagos may provide interesting comparison with real systems .",
    "another change to bring our model more into line with real systems would be to interpolate between the pure evolution and pure immigration models by allowing both to take place concurrently to different degrees .",
    "of particular relevance is the case in which a small degree of evolution is allowed , to determine whether this has a significant effect on the island properties we have identified in this paper .",
    "all of the islands for which results are presented in this paper were grown from a single source community . beside confirming that the results are not significantly altered depending on the course community used , we are in principle able to examine the behaviour of an island where immigration occurs from two or more independent mainlands .",
    "a related complexification of the model which may relate to real ecosystems is to introduce multiple environment species to simulate the presence of different habitats .",
    "this work may require a spatially explicit model for which computational resources are not yet available .",
    "finally we note that one of the most important food web characteristics which we have not examined is the species abundance distribution ( sad ) .",
    "this is related to the various diversity measures in that they provide different scalar measures of this distribution .",
    "the species - area relation is also related to the dependence of the sad on area .",
    "the examination of the sad requires substantial detail , and our results for this will be presented in a future paper .",
