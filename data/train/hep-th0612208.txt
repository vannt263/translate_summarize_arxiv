    "dark energy and its properties is one of the most intriguing puzzles of present day theoretical physics . indeed , there is convincing evidence , coming from snia supernovae  @xcite , large scale structures of the universe  @xcite and the cmb anisotropies  @xcite which leads to the existence of an acceleration of the universe expansion in the recent past .",
    "when interpreted within the realm of general relativity , these results imply the existence of a pervading weakly interacting fluid with a negative equation of state and a dominant energy density .",
    "the simplest possibility is of course a pure cosmological constant .",
    "this has the advantage of both fitting the data and incorporating a mild modification of the einstein equations .",
    "now it happens that the value of the cosmological constant is so small compared to high energy physics scales that no proper explanation for such a fine  tuning has been found except maybe the anthropic principle  @xcite used in the context of a stringy landscape  @xcite .",
    "this is all the more puzzling in view of the very diverse sources of radiative corrections in the standard model of particle physics and beyond .",
    "a plausible alternative involves the presence of a scalar field akin to the inflaton of early universe cosmology and responsible for the tiny vacuum energy scale  @xcite .",
    "these models of quintessence have nice features such as the presence of long time attractors ( tracking fields ) leading to a relative insensitivity to initial conditions  @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the quintessence runaway potentials lead to large values of the quintessence field now , of the order of the planck mass .",
    "this immediately prompts the necessity of embedding such models in high energy physics where nearly planck scale physics is taken into account .",
    "the most natural possibility is supergravity as it involves both supersymmetry and gravitational effects  @xcite .",
    "moreover , superstring theories lead to supergravity models at low energy .    from the model building point of view",
    ", the quintessence field does not belong to the well - known sector of particles of the standard model .",
    "therefore , one has to envisage a dark sector where this field lives and provide the corresponding khler , @xmath0 , and super potentials @xmath1 in order to compute the quintessence scalar potential explicitly .",
    "once a quintessence model has been built , one must also worry about the coupling to both matter and hidden sector supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "indeed the rolling of the quintessence field can induce variations of constants such as the fine structure constants .",
    "moreover the smallness of the mass of the quintessence field implies that its gravitational coupling to matter must be suppressed in order to comply with fifth force and equivalence principle violation experiments  @xcite .",
    "the observable sector is fairly well - known and the hidden sector can be parameterized .",
    "therefore , the main uncertainty comes from the dark sector , _",
    "i.e. _  from the specific form chosen for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "recently , we have investigated this question for a class of models where the khler potential and the superpotential can be taylor expanded or are given by polynomial functions of the ( super ) fields  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that this type of models , under the standard assumption of separate sectors ( see also our conclusion ) , is in trouble as either they are uninteresting from the cosmological point of view ( typically , in practice , they are equivalent to a cosmological constant ) or they violate the bounds from gravity experiments ( typically , they violate the bound on the fifth force and/or on the weak equivalence principle ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a general class of models , probably the most natural one from a string theory point of view  @xcite , where the quintessence field is a moduli field ( khler moduli ) .",
    "technically , this means that @xmath0 is taken to be a logarithm of the quintessence field  @xcite .",
    "although the khler function is known , there is no specific standard choice for the superpotential which remains a free function .",
    "therefore , we will derive model independent results and then discuss the various cases that have been envisaged in the literature for @xmath1 ( for instance , polynomial superpotentials and exponential ones _  la _ kklt  @xcite ) .",
    "we show that , for reasonable choices of @xmath2 , the corresponding models are also in trouble from the gravity experiments point of view .",
    "this last result is in fact more subtle than in the case of the first class of models treated in ref .",
    "indeed , contrary to the polynomial models , a chameleon mechanism  @xcite can be present in the no scale case and could be used to protect the quintessence field from gravity problems .",
    "however , unfortunately , we show that this mechanism is in fact not sufficiently efficient to save no scale quintessence in simple cases such as gaugino condensation and polynomial superpotentials .",

    "we only consider that there is a single moduli @xmath3 which can be seen as the breathing mode of the compactification manifold .",

    ", we assume that the quintessence sector is only coupled gravitationally to the observable and hidden sectors  @xcite . in some sense",
    ", this assumption is that of non triviality of the model .",
    "the corresponding situation can be described by the following khler and super potentials  @xcite @xmath17 now the observable sector is known since it comprises the fields of the minimal standard supersymetric model ( mssm ) @xmath18 and the corresponding superpotential can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a supersymmetric mass matrix and @xmath21 the yukawa couplings .",
    "the fact that susy is broken in an hidden sector modifies the shape of the quintessence potential . another way to put",
    "it is that the susy breaking causes the appearance of soft terms in the dark sector and these soft terms are responsible for the modification of the quintessence potential .",

    "indeed , it is easy to demonstrate that @xmath155 is a decreasing function ( for @xmath156 which is clearly the case of physical interest ) as @xmath157 is .",
    "hence , this model is ruled out gravitationally .",
    "a class of potential with phenomenological interest can be obtained if the quintessence field @xmath3 has a non - renormalisable superpotential .",
    "although this is not what is expected from string theory , we will consider as it leads to very appealing quintessential properties .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath158 using eq .",
    "( [ potquint ] ) , straightforward calculations lead to the following form @xmath159\\ , .\\ ] ] this leads to a satisfying exponential potential when @xmath160 .",
    "these potentials have been thoroughly studied and lead to the existence of long time attractors  @xcite .",
    "again , the runaway feature of the potential implies that it is a good quintessence candidate .",
    "then , as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ potde ] ) , the shape of the quintessence potential is modified by the soft terms present in the dark sector .",
    "one obtains @xmath161 + \\frac12m_{_{\\rm s}}m^3\\exp \\left[-(n-3)\\sqrt{\\frac23}q\\right ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as already discussed , the correction is proportional to the susy breaking scale @xmath27 . it has the structure of a two exponential potential .",
    "as @xmath15 gets large , the second term of the potential dominates and leads to acceleration in the matter era provided @xmath162",
    "_ i.e. _  @xmath163 . in this case",
    ", the future of our universe would be with @xmath164 with an equation of state @xmath165 which is close to @xmath166 when @xmath167 is close to @xmath168 .",
    "finally , the effective potential for this model reads @xmath169 from this expression one can deduce @xmath123 and the mass of the field at the minimum .",
    "one finds @xmath170\\right\\}\\ , , \\quad m^2=\\frac{n(n-3)}{3}\\frac{m_{_{\\rm s}}m^3}{{m_{_{\\mathrm{pl}}}}^2 } \\left(\\frac{n-3}{n}\\frac{m_{_{\\rm s}}m^3}{\\rho _ { \\rm mat}}{\\rm e}^{\\sqrt{6}q_0 } \\right)^{(3-n)/n}\\ , .\\ ] ] as an example , let us consider the earth in our local neighborhood of the galaxy .",
    "we have @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 . for @xmath175 and @xmath176 ,",
    "this gives @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "since @xmath179 and @xmath180 , one gets @xmath181 and therefore @xmath182 since @xmath183 , the range of the corresponding force is very big .",
    "the conclusion is that , although we have a chameleon mechanism which renders the analysis of the gravity tests non trivial , this one is not efficient enough and the corresponding model is ruled out .",
    "we have presented models of moduli quintessence . despite the large gravitational coupling of the moduli to matter in these models ,",
    "a chameleon mechanism is at play and could render the models compatible with gravitational experiments .",
    "unfortunately , in realistic cases such as gaugino condensation or non - renormalisable superpotentials , the chameleon phenomenon is not strong enough to save the models .",
    "one can deduce a no - go theorem ( modulo , of course , the assumptions made in this article , in particular that of the separate sectors ) showing the incompatibility between quintessence in supergravity and gravity tests .",
    "let us come back to the general structure of the scalar potential .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , see eq .",
    "( 2.18 ) , it can always be written as @xmath184 where we have chosen to emphasize the various combinations of scales appearing in this expression and where , consequently , @xmath185 and @xmath186 are dimensionless functions , _ a priori _ of order one at present time .",
    "the last term contains the f - terms of the hidden sector .",
    "let us consider first models where the khler potential can be expanded around @xmath187 .",
    "after a khler transformation , one can always expand @xmath188 where @xmath189 represent planck suppressed operators which , at present time , are not necessarily negligible since we have @xmath190 now .",
    "it is immediate to see that at leading order , the quintessence field picks up a soft breaking mass @xmath191 where we have used that @xmath192 and have imposed @xmath193 in order to cancel the intolerably large contribution to the cosmological constant coming from the hidden sector .",
    "the last equality originates from the condition @xmath34 . from eq .",
    "( [ depoly ] ) , we see that the potential acquires a minimum since , in general , the functions @xmath194 and @xmath195 are of the runaway type , _",
    "i.e. _  decreasing with @xmath3 .",
    "the value of the minimum is controlled by the scales @xmath10 , @xmath27 and @xmath111 . due to the large value of @xmath111 compared to the quintessence field",
    ", the minimum is generically small in planck units .",
    "the scale @xmath10 is tuned to get a minimum value for the potential of order @xmath196 . at this minimum ,",
    "the mass of the quintessence field is @xmath111 large enough to evade all the gravitational tests .",
    "now , cosmologically , the steepness of the quadratic potential in @xmath3 implies that the field must have settled at the minimum before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . if not , the energy density of the quintessence field would exceed the mev energy scale of bbn . in practice ,",
    "the potential is constant since bbn , _",
    "i.e. _  equivalent to a cosmological constant .",
    "notice that the coupling of the quintessence field to matter induces a correction to the potential in @xmath197 which is negligible compared to @xmath198 , hence no chameleon effect .",
    "one can circumvent this argument by taking singular potentials where the potential term in @xmath199 is constant .",
    "one can choose @xmath200\\ , .\\ ] ] in this case , n=3 for moduli and n=1 for the dilaton .",
    "fine - tuning of the cosmological constant requires @xmath201 leaving @xmath202 no mass term appears for the quintessence field .",
    "the dynamics are similar to the no - scale case with a contribution from the matter density .",
    "the mass of the quintessence field at the minimum of the matter - dependent potential is of order @xmath109 .",
    "moreover the thin - shell effect is only present for small values of the normalized scalar field @xmath15 , a situation which requires a non - generic quintessence superpotential ( otherwise @xmath203 generically ) .",
    "we conclude that under broad circumstances , one can not obtain a compatibility between quintessence and gravity tests in supergravity .",
    "either the dynamics are equivalent to a cosmological constant or gravity tests are not evaded .",
    "one possibility is to relinquish the assumption on the khler potential ( three decoupled khler potentials ) .",
    "work on this possibility ( sequestered models and others ) is in progress .",
