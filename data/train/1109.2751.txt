    "cascading processes in optical materials that involve several different second - order nonlinear interactions provide an efficient way to lower the critical power of optical parametric devices .",
    "the concept of multistep cascading brings new ideas into this field , leading to the possibility of an enhanced nonlinearity - induced phase shift , the simultaneous generation of higher - order harmonics , multicolor parametric interaction , difference - frequency generation , ( see , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "multistep parametric interactions and multistep cascading are characterized by at least two different nearly phase - matching or quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) parameters .",
    "qpm is an important technique in nonlinear optics and is widespread used for various applications @xcite .",
    "the width of the phase - matching curve depends on the type of the crystal , its length , and the phase - matching method .",
    "qpm not only makes efficient frequency conversion possible , but also enables diverse applications such as beam and pulse shaping , multi - harmonic generation , high harmonic generation and all - optical processing .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that the quantum - computational gates , multimode quantum interference of photons and preparation of multi - photon entangled states also can be realized in qpm structures @xcite .     with @xmath0 and @xmath1 with phase - reversal grating ( with period @xmath2 ) upon a uniform qpm grating ( with period @xmath3).,width=325 ]",
    "one of the non - uniform qpm structures is so - called phase - reversed structures @xcite , which has been studied both theoretically and experimentally and have been employed for the wavelength conversion , and for the cascaded single - crystal third harmonic generation process @xcite .",
    "several proposals for increasing the phase - matching region have also been suggested , including the use of the phase - reversed qpm structures .",
    "these structures are based on the use of a phase - reversed sequence of many equivalent uniform short qpm domains , particularly , periodically poled domains , in which neighboring nonlinear segments have the opposite signs of the second - order susceptibility .",
    "the phase - reversed structures arranged in such a way that at the place of the joint two ends of the domains segments have the same sign of the @xmath4 coefficient ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . on the whole",
    ", this structure is characterized by two grating wave vectors allowing phase - match two processes . in the standard approach",
    ", the one - dimensional @xmath5 function leading to the phase - reversed qpm structure can be described by the infinite fourier expansion on two periods .",
    "such phenomenological approach qualitatively explains the simultaneous qpm of two parametric nonlinear processes , however , has not included the parameters of realistic structured nonlinear materials .",
    "these dates often should be taken into to consideration if we are interest in more detailed description of cascaded parametric processes .    in this paper , we present more detailed description of phase - reversed structures in another way as the definite assembly of nonlinear segments .",
    "then , we arrange this structure for two cascaded parametric devices proposed for generation of three - photon and four - photon states . in this way , we consider cascaded collinear parametric processes in one dimensional media .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider an effective nonlinear coefficient @xmath6 of three - wave interaction in one - dimensional phase - reversed media .",
    "this quantity is defined as the fourier transform of the second order susceptibility @xmath5 in term of wave vectors mismatch @xmath7 of three - wave interaction caused by dispersion in an optical material . in sec.iii",
    "we briefly consider application of these results for obtaining qpm in generation of multi - photonic states .",
    "we start with consideration of effective coupling constant @xmath6 that usually describe three - wave interaction in second - order nonlinear media with the susceptibility @xmath8 in the following form    @xmath9    where @xmath7 is the phase - matching parameter and @xmath10 is a length of medium . in the phenomenological approach",
    "the @xmath5 function leading to the phase - reversed qpm structure can be described by the following fourier expansion @xmath11 that is the product of two periodic functions . here : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the effective interaction constant reads as    @xmath17    considering the phase - reversed qpm structure as the definite assembly of nonlinear segments we turn to the general formula obtained for the effective coupling constant in multilayered media @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the phase - matching function of three photon process in the each @xmath20-th domain , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the refractive index of the medium at the given frequency .    in the result , the effective nonlinear coefficient @xmath6 for the scheme depicted in the fig.1 can be calculated in the following form @xmath23 we assume that phase - matching parameters are the same for all layers @xmath24 , as well as @xmath25 .",
    "we introduce the qpm function @xmath26 which is the product of the standard phase - matching spectral function for a single segment , i.e. @xmath27 , and the assemble function    @xmath28}}{\\sin{[\\frac{l}{2}(\\delta k - g)]}}\\frac{\\sin{[\\frac{mnl}{2}(\\delta k - f)]}}{\\sin{[\\frac{nl}{2}(\\delta k - f)]}}. \\label{ymn}\\ ] ]    here : @xmath29-is the number of domains in each block , @xmath30-is the number of blocks , @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32-is the length of each domain , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "it is easy to check that the function @xmath38 has an alternative representation , as the product of expansions on the number of domains and blocks    @xmath39    where @xmath40 . as we see , the above expressions ( [ p - rg ] ) , ( [ ymnsharq ] ) derived on the base of the method of superlatices elaborated on the multilayered media differs from the formula ( [ giranc ] ) , which is obtained in the standard , phenomenological approach .",
    "in contrast to the expression ( [ giranc ] ) , the results ( [ ymn]),([ymnsharq ] ) depend on the number of the domains and blocks and also describe the case of small numbers of the segments .",
    "it is remarkable , that in this case the qpm function displays specific interference effects .",
    "nevertheless , as shows our analysis some consequences of both ( [ giranc ] ) and ( [ p - rg ] ) results , for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , coincide qualitatively .",
    "note , that single - phase - matched process of three - photon interaction in multilayered media is also described by an assembly function .",
    "for ppln structure ( see , one of the block in fig.1 containing n layers ) the phase - matching function is calculated as    @xmath43}}{\\sin{[\\frac{l}{2}(\\delta k - g ) ] } } , \\label{yn}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the wave vectors mismatch of three - wave interaction .",
    "this function exhibits a structure of single narrow peaks as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the obtained qpm function @xmath26 allows simultaneously phase - match two parametric processes which is achieved by using two grating vectors . in order to illustrate the possibility of the double phase - matching in such superlattice structure we present a detailed analysis of the function @xmath44 in dependence on the parameter @xmath45 in the graphical form ( see , figs .  [ 822 ] ,  [ 922 ] )",
    "the assembly function exhibits the structure of peaks that are separated by @xmath46 . unlike to the assembly function for single - phase - matched process",
    ", @xmath47 function has more complex structure , particularly , each group of the extremes consists of thin structure of twin - narrow peaks , separated by oscillating low maxima .",
    "the @xmath27 multiplier causes decreasing the amplitude of the consecutive peaks .",
    "the behavior of @xmath44 function is different for even and odd values of @xmath30 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ 822 ] for even values of @xmath30 the twin peaks have the opposite signs , while for odd values of @xmath30 the both narrow peaks have the same sign ( see fig .  [ 922 ] ) .",
    "the existence of twin peaks and oscillation between them are the main peculiarities of this structure .",
    "these twin narrow peaks can be chosen to phase - match two parametric processes involved into the multistep - cascading .     for even numbers of both domains and blocks ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the inset shows the twin narrow peaks of opposite amplitudes.,width=302 ]     for even numbers of @xmath48 and odd numbers @xmath50 .",
    "the inset shows the twin narrow peaks of the same amplitudes.,width=302 ]     for the small numbers of domains and blocks , namely @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the insert shows the broadening of the peaks .",
    ", width=302 ]    here we represent @xmath26 function for the small number of domains to exhibit direct correlation between number of domains and the width of phase - matching function ( see , fig .",
    "[ y26 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to notice that with the decrease of number of domains and blocks the narrow peaks in the pase - matching function becomes wider , as well as the number of oscillation between twin peaks decreases . besides this , the positions of the maxima of the phase - matching function becomes slightly shifted , although the periodicity of the @xmath44 function is remained the same .",
    "in this section , we apply the above results analyzing the qpm in generation of both photon triplet and four - photon states in cascaded down - conversion . recently ,",
    "production of joint multiphoton states , particularly , photon triplet have attracted a great interest in probing the foundations of quantum theory and for various applications in quantum information technologies ( see , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "depending on the configuration of the experiment and the designs of the crystal , the multiphoton states can be entangled in any number of variables : time , frequency , direction of propagation , and polarization .",
    "studies carried out with miltiphoton state beams range from the examination of quantum paradoxes , to applications in optical measurements , spectroscopy , imaging , and quantum information ( see , @xcite and references there ) . in this way ,",
    "the direct generation of photon triplets using cascaded photon - pairs has been demonstrated in periodically poled lithium niobate crystals @xcite .",
    "most recently , joint quantum states of three - photons with arbitrary spectral characteristics have been studied on the base of optical superlattises @xcite . in continuous of this paper ,",
    "we analyze the cascaded generation of photon triplets in phase - reversed superlattice of @xmath4 materials .",
    "we consider collinear , one - dimensional configurations focusing on consideration of cascaded parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) , which generates three - photon states in the presence of an optical cavity . in the scheme considered the pump field at the frequency @xmath53 converts to the subharmonics at the central frequencies @xmath54 and",

    "the cavity modes are described by discreet creation and annihilation operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 as @xmath69 describes the amplitude of the driving fields .",
    "for the case of the phase - reversed superlattice structure the constants of the processes @xmath56 and @xmath57 are calculated as    @xmath70    where @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "in general , the amplitude of three - photons at the frequencies @xmath73 generated in cascaded down - conversion has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the factor @xmath74 . for the case of phase - reverse structure we can calculate three - photon amplitude in the following form    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the two - dimension assemble function that describes joint phase - matching ,",

    "three - photon down - conversion is controlled by energy conservation between the pump and daughter photons @xmath80 .    analyzing the graphics of @xmath44 ( see fig .  [ 922 ] ) in application to cascaded scheme of down - conversion we could arrange two twin peaks of the phase - matching function with the wave - vector mismatches of cascading processes .",
