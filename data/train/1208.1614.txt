    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are some of the brightest objects in the universe .",
    "this makes them visible to huge distances , and therefore useful in applications ranging from studies of galactic ionized gas ( through interstellar scintillation ; @xcite ) , to measuring positions on earth to centimetre precision ( via the technique of geodetic very long baseline interferometry ; @xcite ) , to cosmological applications ( through their use as standard candles ; @xcite ) .    agn play a key role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the evolution of black holes and galaxies are tightly coupled throughout cosmic history @xcite , and nuclear activity of black holes imparts significant feedback on the surrounding gas through radiatively and mechanically driven outflows .",
    "radio - emitting jets of relativistic particles inflate cocoons of radio plasma , which in turn drive bow shocks through the host galaxy and beyond @xcite . on large scales ,",
    "these shocks are observed to uplift the hot gas present in galaxy clusters .",
    "even once jet activity ceases , jet  inflated radio lobes can rise buoyantly through cluster gas , transporting the gas outward ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "agn activity is intermittent , triggered by either radiatively efficient accretion onto the black hole ( the so - called `` cold mode '' ) ; or radiatively inefficient ( `` hot mode '' ) accretion @xcite .",
    "powerful radio agn are typically associated with the radiatively efficient mode , and often exhibit high - excitation ionization lines @xcite .",
    "this mode of agn triggering is often associated with mergers @xcite , and was likely prevalent in a younger , denser universe .",
    "by contrast , the majority of low ",
    "redshift radio agn are low power , and show no such strong emission lines ; these are consistent with being fuelled by steady cooling of hot x  ray emitting gas in galactic haloes @xcite .    from a theoretical viewpoint",
    ", agn feedback is a crucial ingredient of all galaxy formation models , truncating ( the otherwise ) excessive star formation in massive galaxies at late times , and ensuring that present - day ellipticals are `` red and dead '' @xcite .",
    "this feedback can come from radiative pressure @xcite , quasar winds @xcite , jets @xcite or a combination of these @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have argued that agn feedback significantly affects the star formation histories of agn hosts @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested on energetic grounds that a single agn may be able to expel gas from multiple galactic haloes .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed this observationally : shocks from the largest ( hundreds of kpc  scale ) radio agn were found to truncate star formation in dwarf galaxies that themselves may have never hosted an agn",
    ". this potentially important new mode of feedback depends sensitively on the combination of agn jet power and environment density . in order to form a large radio agn , the radio jet needs to pierce the dense environment of the agn host without being disrupted by magnetohydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "weak jets in moderate density environments , or moderate power jets in dense environments , are easily disrupted within dense galactic cores @xcite , and are thus unable to do large ",
    "scale feedback .",
    "therefore , accurate measurement of agn jet power is crucial to quantifying the effects of agn on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "measuring kinetic agn power is difficult .",
    "dynamical models , utilizing observed sizes and luminosities of radio agn , can be used to estimate jet powers @xcite .",
    "these models rely on some knowledge of environment into which the radio lobes are expanding , and agn age .",
    "a closely related cavity power method relies on measurements of the work done by the radio lobes in inflating cavities in the x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "this method also requires knowledge of both the density of the gas into which the lobes are expanding , and age of the radio lobes .",
    "ages of synchrotron  emitting electrons can be estimated from either radio spectra @xcite or dynamical models , and the two estimates typically differ by a factor of two ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the cavity technique is limited to nearby , low - power radio galaxies , and the derived jet powers may thus be unrepresentative of the overall agn population .",
    "other sources of error in jet power estimates arise due to uncertainties in the exact gas density profile : for example , cavity measurements typically assume that the radio lobes expand into a constant density atmosphere throughout their lifetime .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a fundamentally different method for measuring agn jet power to a sample of flat spectrum radio quasars .",
    "this method , first devised by @xcite and further discussed by @xcite , is based on the interpretation of the frequency dependent position shift of flat spectrum radio cores in terms of synchrotron self - absorption within the jet plasma .",
    "we compare the derived jet powers with narrow - line luminosities .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "this work is based on the standard model of self - absorbed radio cores , in which the unresolved , flat spectrum  core \" in vlbi images of radio quasars is understood to be associated with the part of the jet at which the optical depth is unity .",
    "the core shift with frequency is interpreted as being due to the changing synchrotron self - absorption opacity in a freely expanding jet @xcite . using this model ,",
    "a measurement of the core shift between multiple frequencies along with a number of reasonable assumptions allows an estimate to be made of the physical parameters of the jet plasma , and therefore , an estimate of the jet kinetic energy flux .",
    "here we recount the relevant details of the model , and expand on the analysis presented in @xcite and @xcite in the context of jet power measurements .",
    "* appendix b ) provides a detailed derivation of the equation for kinetic energy flux in a relativistic jet in terms of the physical parameters .",
    "the relevant quantities are defined as follows : @xmath3 is the jet bulk velocity and @xmath4 the corresponding bulk lorentz factor , @xmath5 the jet cross - sectional area , @xmath6 the density of relativistic electrons / positrons , @xmath7 the magnetic field strength , @xmath8 the energy density of relativistic electrons / positrons and @xmath9 is the magnetic energy density in cgs units .",
    "we assume that the jet plasma may be a mixture of relativistically cold matter with pressure much less than rest mass energy density , and relativistic particles with pressure @xmath10 .",

    "observations suggest the core shift scales as the inverse of frequency ( @xmath36 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is indicative of conical jet structure and equipartition conditions , since parabolic jet structure produced due to external pressure gradients is likely to result in a significantly flatter core position ",
    "frequency dependence @xcite .",
    "we therefore reasonably assume constant opening angle in our analysis .",
    "for such a jet , @xmath37 , and the precise value depends on the magnetic field geometry : @xmath38 for the component of magnetic field parallel to the jet , and @xmath39 for the component of magnetic field perpendicular to the jet .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the perpendicular component of the magnetic field is the dominant one , such that @xmath39 .",
    "conservation of particles then implies @xmath40 .",
    "we assume a power - law energy distribution for the relativistic electrons / positrons of the form @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 represents the scaling of the particle energy distribution , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the optically thin synchrotron spectral index , typically in the range @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath50 is a tabulated function of the spectral index .",
    "setting the optical depth @xmath51 gives the location of the core as a function of frequency , @xmath52 :    @xmath53    equation  [ eqn : nu_s ] can be rearranged to give the difference between radii ( in parsecs ) at which the core is observed at two frequencies ,    @xmath54    equation [ eqn : delta_r_pc ] contains two unknowns , so in order to determine the physical parameters of the jet from a measured core shift , we must make some assumption about the relationship between particle density ( @xmath35 ) and magnetic field strength ( @xmath34 ) at one parsec , which we discuss in the following section",

    "@xcite found a correlation between narrow - line luminosity and jet power in a sample of 3crr radio galaxies and steep spectrum quasars .",

    "narrow - line emission results from the radiation field of the black hole accretion disk ionizing nearby gas clouds , and as such , a correlation between jet power and narrow - line luminosity is to be expected , since a higher accretion rate should result in both higher jet powers and stronger ionizing radiation field .    from the literature , we selected quasars with measured core shifts , jet parameters and o[ii ] and o[iii ] line fluxes . where multiple core shifts were available ( as is the case for most of our sample ) , we calculated the frequency - independent core shift function @xmath74 for each frequency pair , and adopted the median value .",

    "our slope of @xmath76 agrees with the rawlings & saunders value of @xmath77 .",
    "the scatter of 0.6 dex about the best - fit relation is also comparable with the rawlings & saunders value of 0.5 dex .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that those authors used a completely different method ( cavity jet powers ) and a completely different sample ( steep spectrum ) of radio sources .     and @xmath78 ; and the vertical lines are similar limits in narrow - line luminosity .",

    "@xcite built on the work of @xcite in reporting a correlation between cavity - derived agn jet powers and radio luminosities .",
    "@xcite similarly use agn radio luminosity as a proxy for jet power , based on a correlation between narrow - line and radio luminosities .",
    "these methods are useful , largely because radio luminosity is a relatively easy quantity to measure ; and yield similar scatter ( 0.8 and 0.5 dex respectively ) to our core shift technique .",
    "however , one must be careful in extrapolating these results to large samples .",
    "dynamical models of radio sources , on which the @xcite method is based , only apply to powerful fanaroff  riley ( fr ) type ii radio sources . on the other hand , weaker fr",
    "i radio sources dominate agn counts in the local universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these models are sensitive to environment : a jet with a given kinetic power will appear brighter at radio wavelengths if it propagates though denser gas .",
    "by contrast , the core shift method is independent of environment .    the slope of the cavity jet power ",
    "integrated radio power relation reported by @xcite is @xmath80 at 1.4 ghz , and @xmath81 at 327 mhz . at low frequencies",
    "the agn radio luminosity will be dominated by lobe emission ; while at higher frequencies flat - spectrum components such as jet core and hotspots will also contribute .",
    "this flat - spectrum contribution will be greater for powerful jets , resulting in a flattening of the @xmath82@xmath83 slope at higher frequencies .",
    "these factors , along with environmental dependence , are also likely to be responsible for the larger scatter ( 0.8 dex ) in the @xcite relation compared with our method . nevertheless , the slopes reported by these authors are broadly consistent with our results .",
    "@xcite derived jet properties for a large sample ( 67 ) of flat spectrum radio agn .",
    "this sample is complete to 1.5 jy at 15 ghz @xcite , and is thus representative of the flat spectrum radio agn population . using this data , we find that the distribution of the function @xmath84 is roughly log - normal for quasars ( figure  [ fig : phidist ] ) , which constitute the majority of the sample .",
    "quasars have a mean of @xmath85 and standard deviation of @xmath86 .",
    "due to insufficient statistics ( 16 objects ) it is difficult to say whether the distribution of @xmath87 for bl lacs / galaxies is similarly log - normal .",

    "red circles represent quasars ( 51 objects ) , blue squares are bl lacs and galaxies ( 16 objects ) .",
    "shaded regions show poisson uncertainties.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    importantly , these distributions are narrow enough for core shift measurements to be useful predictors of jet power even if jet orientation parameters are not known : for a given narrow - line luminosity , 68 percent of the agn should have jet powers that are within a factor of 2.5 from the `` best guess '' values .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : coreshiftfunction ] , where we plot the predicted jet power @xmath90 , which is calculated using the mean @xmath91 values above , against narrow - line luminosity .",
    "unlike figure  [ fig : jetpowers ] , agn with unknown values of @xmath92 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 are also plotted .",
    "the strong correlation between these two quantities ( slope @xmath93 , scatter 0.4 dex ) suggests that core shifts can be used to estimate the kinetic energy flux of flat spectrum agn even if the jet velocity , viewing angle , and opening angle are not known .",
    "the best  fit relation for quasars , assuming an electron  positron jet in equipartition for @xmath94 , is    @xmath95^{1/2 } \\frac{1}{(1+z)^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\left[\\delta r_{\\rm mas } d_{\\rm",

    "the median jet power is a factor of 2 lower for bl lacs , for the same core shift and other properties , due to the different distribution of jet parameters ( as given by @xmath87 ; see figure  [ fig : phidist ] ) .    for an electron  proton jet ,",

    "the estimation of jet powers from limited data , as given by equations  [ eqn : qjetavg ] and [ eqn : qjetproton ] , is possible because the flat spectrum constraint necessarily limits the agn sample to objects with a narrow range of viewing angle , and @xmath92 and @xmath26 have narrow distributions .    .",

    "we have calculated agn jet powers from multi - frequency core shifts in flat spectrum quasars .",
    "we find a strong correlation between jet power and agn narrow - line luminosity , consistent with the results of @xcite for steep spectrum radio galaxies .",
    "the core shift method has strong predictive power , allowing accurate estimates of jet power to be made in the absence of detailed jet and agn orientation parameters .",
    "the geometry of the universe makes the core shift method a potentially very powerful one for measuring agn jet powers , particularly in the era of new , high sensitivity instruments capable of very high astrometric precision such as the square kilometre array @xcite .",
    "the angular diameter distance turns over at redshift 1.6 , making it in principle even easier to measure a core shift at redshift 3 than at redshift 1.5 .",
    "this is also true for other jet power measurement methods , such as dynamical and cavity models .",
    "however , the _ luminosity _ distance increases with redshift , making the detection of steep spectrum objects difficult .",
    "the advantage of the core shift method is in the fact that the flat spectrum nature of core ",
    "shifting quasars allows doppler boosting to bring even intrinsically faint radio sources above the detection limit .",
    "thus , the core shift method will be able to probe higher redshifts and lower luminosities than traditional jet power measurement methods .",
