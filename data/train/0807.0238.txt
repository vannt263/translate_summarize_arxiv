    "over about the past decade , the parameter space of traditional stellar astrophysics has been greatly expanded with the discovery and characterization of brown dwarfs , objects that for most of their lifetimes are colder and less luminous than main - sequence stars . despite ample progress in finding and characterizing brown dwarfs , very few direct measurements of their physical properties",

    "the images were reduced in a standard fashion .",
    "we constructed flat fields from the differences of images of the telescope dome interior with and without continuum lamp illumination .",
    "then we created a master sky frame from the median average of the bias - subtracted , flat - fielded images and subtracted it from the individual images .",
    "images were registered and stacked to form a final mosaic , though all the results described here were based on analysis of the individual images .",
    "outlier images with much poorer fwhm and/or strehl ratios were excluded from the analysis .",
    "instrumental optical distortion was corrected based on analysis by b. cameron ( priv .",
    "comm . ) of images of a precisely machined pinhole grid located at the first focal plane of nirc2 .",
    "the 1@xmath29 residuals of the pinhole images after applying this distortion correction are at the 0.6  mas level over the detector field of view . since the binary separation and the imaging dither steps are small , the effect of the distortion correction is minor , smaller than our final measurement errors .",
    "table  [ table : keck ] compiles the details of our observations , and figure  [ fig : images ] presents our keck lgs data .",
    "full widths at half maxima ( fwhm ) and strehl ratios were determined from two field stars located @xmath1456  from .",
    "the tabulated errors on the fwhm and strehl ratios are the standard deviation of these quantities as measured from the individual images .",
    "to measure the flux ratios and relative positions of s two components , we mostly used the two aforementioned nearby field stars , observed simultaneously with  on nirc2 .",
    "these stars provided an excellent measurement of the instantaneous psf .",
    "we empirically modeled the psf using the starfinder software package , which is designed for analysis of blended ao images . for the jan  2008 data",
    ", we employed a different procedure , fitting analytic psfs comprising multiple elliptical gaussians to model the binary images .",
    "these data were taken at much higher airmass than all the other data . because of the larger atmospheric dispersion and the different colors of the field stars relative to , psf fitting produced less accurate results than the analytic approach , as determined by the artificial binary tests described below .",
    "for every image , we fitted for the fluxes and positions of the two components and then computed the flux ratio , separation , and position angle ( pa ) of the binary .",
    "the averages of the results were adopted as the final measurements .",
    "overall , our psf fitting produced very high quality relative measurements , with errors of order 1% for the flux ratios , 0.05  pixels for the binary separation , and 0.2  for the pa .",
    "note that these latter two values account only for the internal instrumental measurements and do not include the errors on the astrometric calibration of nirc2 , which we include below .    in order to gauge the accuracy of our measurements , we created myriad artificial binary stars from images of the two psf stars .",
    "one psf star was used to create artificial binaries , and the other was used as the single psf for fitting the components . for data at each epoch ,",
    "starfinder was applied to the artificial binaries with similar separations and flux ratios as .",
    "these simulations showed that any systematic offsets in our fitting code are very small , well below the random errors , and that the random errors are accurate . in cases where the rms measurement errors from the artificial binaries were larger than those from the  measurements , we conservatively adopted the larger errors .- band data , and the multi - gaussian fitting was better for the @xmath26 and @xmath27-band data .",
    "overall , fitting the binary images by themselves produced very good astrometry  with internal errors ( i.e. , without the uncertainty in the absolute nirc2 astrometric calibration ) of about 3% for the flux ratio , 0.1  pixels for the separation , and 0.3  for the pa  but slightly worse than our fits using field stars as psfs .",
    "the exception was the jan  2008 data , as described in the text . ]",
    "to convert the instrumental measurements of the binary separation and pa into celestial units , we used a weighted average of the calibration from @xcite , with a pixel scale of @xmath30  mas / pixel and an orientation for the detector s + y  axis of @xmath31 east of north .",
    "these values agree well with keck observatory s notional calibration of @xmath32  mas / pixel and @xmath33 , as well as the @xmath34  mas / pixel and @xmath35  reported by @xcite .",
    "also , comparison of nirc2 images of m92 to astrometrically calibrated _",
    "hst_/acs wide - field camera images gives a pixel scale for nirc2 that agrees to better than 1  part in 10@xmath36 with our values ( j. anderson , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "finally , we must consider the effect of atmospheric refraction .",
    "because of the southern declination of , all of our keck observations were necessarily undertaken at significant airmass ( @xmath151.55 ) . because the two components of the binary do not have exactly the same spectral types (   [ sec : phot ] ) , the observed positions on the sky are subject to slightly different amounts of differential chromatic refraction ( dcr ) .",
    "we computed the expected shift in the relative astrometry at each epoch using the prescriptions of @xcite for the dcr offset and for the refractive index of dry air .",
    "we assumed a fiducial temperature of 275 k and pressure of 608 millibars for conditions on mauna kea @xcite .",
    "we computed the effective wavelengths for spectral types of t5.0 and t5.5 for the two components using using all available spectra of these subclasses contained in the spex prism spectral library ( from @xcite , and @xcite ) and the appropriate filter response curve .",
    "note that because of the unusual spectra of t  dwarfs , the effective wavelengths of the secondary component is actually bluer in @xmath27- and @xmath24-bands and redder only in @xmath26-band compared to the primary component .",
    "given the fact that the secondary is mostly north of the primary at all of our keck epochs , dcr causes the separation of the binary to appear slightly smaller at @xmath27 and @xmath24-bands and slightly larger at @xmath26-band compared to the true position as would be observed at zenith .",
    "the amplitude of the dcr effect is about 0.3  mas , much smaller than the measurement errors at most ( but not all ) of the keck epochs .",
    "however , the effect is a systematic one so we correct the relative astrometry of the two components based on our calculations .",
    "table  1 presents the final resulting measurements from our keck lgs data .",
    "for the april  2005 dataset , all three filters give astrometry consistent within the measurement errors ; we use only the @xmath27-band results in the orbit fitting discussed below . in the table and in our orbit",
    "fitting (   [ sec : orbit - fitting ] ) , we take care to discriminate between the instrumental errors ( namely those that arise solely from fitting the binary images ) and the overall astrometric calibration of nirc2 , and thus any future refinements in the latter can be readily applied to our measurements .",
    "the two components of  are only barely resolved in the _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 @xmath37 discovery images from august  2000 .",
    "therefore , to determine their relative positions and fluxes , we must model the images using the sum of two blended psfs .",
    "the psf of wfpc2 s planetary camera ( pc ) is undersampled ( fwhm  =  1.7  pix for @xmath37 ) ; this makes any empirical determination of the psf difficult without psfs sampled at many subpixel locations .",
    "moreover , anderson & king ( 2003 ) found that the wfpc2 psf varies significantly over the detector due to geometric distortion , making it impossible to construct a reliable empirical psf from other stars in the same image , even if there are enough to sample many subpixel locations .",
    "the original analysis by @xcite employed a hybrid gaussian / empirical psf to fit for the binary parameters with resulting uncertainties of @xmath387  mas in separation and @xmath389@xmath39 in pa .",
    "the astrometry from the wfpc2 discovery epoch is obviously very important to the orbit determination , so we undertook our own analysis with a more accurate psf model to improve the precision of the binary parameters .",
    "we used the tinytim software package ( krist 1995 ) to create model psfs for the wfpc2 images .",
    "we generated 5@xmath40 super - sampled psfs that included the effects of ( 1 ) variation with position on the detector ; ( 2 ) broad - band wavelength dependence , by taking into account the filter response curve and the spectrum of the source ( using the keck / lris optical spectrum of the t4.5 dwarf 2mass  j05591914@xmath01404488 from burgasser et al .",
    "( 2003 ) as the template for the individual components of ) , ( 3 ) telescope jitter ( 0 to 20  mas of gaussian jitter ) , and ( 4 ) telescope defocus ( @xmath3810 @xmath41 m ) to account for _ hst _  breathing effects . because the geometrical distortion is location - dependent , we used tinytim model psfs generated for the nearest integer pixel location to the centroid of the binary or single t  dwarf .",
    "also , we used the template spectrum closest to the spectral type of the t dwarf with sufficient wavelength coverage ( 0.700.96 @xmath41 m ) from s. k. leggett s spectral library.1404488 for t4.5 and t5.5 objects @xcite ; sdssp  j162414.37@xmath42002915.6 for t6 objects @xcite ; sdssp  j134646.45@xmath0003150.4 for t6.5 objects @xcite ; and gl  570d for t7.5 objects @xcite . ]",
    "these tinytim model psfs were used to fit simultaneously for ( 1 ) the location of the primary , ( 2 ) the location of the secondary , ( 3 ) the normalization of the model psf to the primary , and ( 4 ) the flux ratio of the two components .",
    "when fitting positions , the super - sampled tinytim psf was interpolated using cubic convolution to the appropriate subpixel location .",
    "the best fit values were found using the ` amoeba ` alogorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to find the minimum @xmath43 value of a 1.1@xmath401.1  subimage centered on the binary .",
    "the image was cleaned using the idl routine ` cr_reject ` in the goddard idl library to identify and mask the numerous cosmic rays in the undithered wfpc2 image pair .",
    "masked pixels were excluded from the computation of the @xmath43 value .",
    "the noise in each pixel was determined from the bias - subtracted raw wfpc2 image , assuming a read noise of 5.3 e@xmath44/pix and a gain given by the header keyword ` atodgain ` .",
    "a grid of psfs in telescope jitter and defocus were tried , and the fit corresponding to the jitter and defocus combination yielding the lowest @xmath43 was chosen . for images of we found that our psf - fitting routine yielded residuals of @xmath452% of the peak value in 90% of pixels with @xmath46 .    due to the optical distortion and `` 34-th row '' defect present in the wfpc2 ( anderson & king 1999 , 2003 )",
    ", the best - fit pixel locations of each binary component do not exactly correspond to their locations in an undistorted celestial reference frame . to remove these effects",
    ", we applied the corrections of anderson & king ( 2003 ) , using a pixel scale of @xmath47  mas / pix .",
    "the 34-th row effect could change , for example , the binary separation by as much as 0.7  mas ( a systematic shift of @xmath00.6@xmath29 ) , but because the binary components do not straddle a defective row and are separated by a mere 1.4  pixels , the application of the 34-th row and distortion corrections have a negligible effect on the astrometry .",
    "with only two undithered wfpc2 images of , it is challenging to quantify the measurement uncertainties , and it is impossible to completely quantify the systematic errors , which arise from an imperfect psf model and also probably depend on the subpixel positions of the two components given the undersampled nature of the data . using only the rms scatter of the two measurements ,",
    "the inferred random errors in separation , pa , and flux ratio are 0.9 mas , 0.07@xmath39 , and 0.03 mag , respectively . to derive more robust random errors and to investigate the systematic errors , we conducted an extensive monte carlo simulation of our fitting routine .",
    "we used wfpc2 @xmath37 images of seven other t  dwarfs from the same _ hst _  program , all apparently single , to create artificial binaries which we then modeled using our psf - fitting routine.1404488 ( t4.5 ) , 2massi  j0937347@xmath42293142 ( t6.0 ) , 2massi  j1217110@xmath0031113 ( t7.5 ) , 2mass  j12373919@xmath426526148 ( t6.5 ) , gl  570d ( t7.5 ) , 2massi  j1546291@xmath0332511 ( t5.5 ) , and 2massi  j2356547@xmath0155310 ( t5.5 ) , using spectral types from @xcite . the remaining object from this program , 2massi  j1047538@xmath42212423 ( t6.5 ) , was unusable for our purposes because it landed on a bad column . ] because the wfpc2 psf is severely undersampled , we only created artificial binaries with integer - shifted positions .",
    "it turns out that the wfpc2 locations of the two components of  are at a very nearly integer - shifted separation of 1.4  pixels ( @xmath48 pix , @xmath49 pix ) .",
    "therefore , in determining the uncertainties and systematic offsets we used only the configuration most nearly matching that of with a separation of @xmath50 pix and instrumental pa of 225@xmath39 . we found that using any or all of the other three @xmath50 configurations gave consistent uncertainties .",
    "after subtracting the best - fit model , artificial binary images yielded residual images in which 90% of pixels with @xmath46 were below 13% of the peak flux , comparable to the residual images of .    the images of the single t  dwarfs span a range in @xmath51 from about 1.5  mag brighter to 1.3  mag fainter than the primary component of .",
    "we used these images at their native @xmath51 when simulating the primary component . to simulate the secondary component , we degraded the @xmath51 of the images assuming a flux ratio of 0.30  mag .",
    "we also tried flux ratios of 0.25  mag and 0.35  mag to explore the possibility that the uncertainties depend on the assumed flux ratio , but we found that this had an insignificant effect on our predicted uncertainties ( @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the number of simulations ) .",
    "signal - to - noise degradation of an image was done by a multiplicative scaling followed by the addition of normally distributed random noise to each pixel , according to the same wfpc2 noise model we used to determine @xmath43 in the psf - fitting procedure .",
    "in fact , by running simulations where the primary images were degraded to much lower @xmath51 , we found that all of the single t dwarfs are in a high @xmath51 regime in which systematic errors ( psf model imperfections ) dominate , not random errors ( photon noise )  our simulations showed no dependence between the @xmath51 of the t  dwarf used to construct artificial binaries and the resulting astrometric uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we used the rms of the results from all simulated binaries in order to determine the final uncertainties for .",
    "as expected , the uncertainties in separation , pa , and flux ratio from our simulations were somewhat larger than those derived from the standard deviation of the measurements from the two  images , since both random and systematic errors have been evaluated in the simulations .",
    "in fact , the larger uncertainties are not simply due to averaging over , for example , the many subpixel locations of the single t  dwarfs used in the monte carlo , because the simulated measurements for each single t  dwarf show scatter consistent with the final derived uncertainties .",
    "table  [ table : hst ] presents our final results for the wfpc2 images , with systematic offsets from the monte carlo simulations applied .",
    "our astrometry agrees well ( better than 1@xmath29 ) with the original results of @xcite , though our measurement errors are a factor of  8 smaller .",
    "part of this improvement comes from our use of tinytim - computed psfs , as opposed to the simpler burgasser et al .",
    "psf model of a gaussian plus empirical residuals .",
    "we also used all possible single psfs in our artificial - binary simulations , whereas burgasser et al .",
    "used only wfpc2 images of 2mass  j0559@xmath01404 , a source that is suspected to be an unresolved binary.1404 is roughly twice as luminous as objects of similar spectral type @xcite .",
    "high angular resolution observations have not detected any multiplicity ( @xcite ; liu et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , but the source could be a very tight system , e.g. , with a 0.5  pixel separation .",
    "if so , its multiplicity could confuse any attempts to fit only two single psfs to the tightest artificial binaries constructed from its image .",
    "interestingly , we found that at the smallest ( 1.0 pixel ) separations , artificial binaries constructed from images of 2mass  j0559@xmath01404 yielded extremely large uncertainties ( 5  mas and 15 ) .",
    "we did not observe such behavior for any of the other six apparently single t dwarfs , nor were the uncertainties for larger separation binaries made from 2mass  j0559@xmath01404 abnormally large .",
    "one natural explanation would be that the source is just marginally resolved in the wfpc2 imaging . ] and part of the improved uncertainties is somewhat illusional , as it arises from the different parameter space explored in monte carlo simulations by us and burgaser et al .  as a check , we ran a suite of simulations more comparable to that of burgasser et al . ,",
    "in which the ranges of artificial binary parameters were 1.03.0 pixels in separation , the full range of pas , and 0.01.0 mag in flux ratio .",
    "these yielded similar astrometric uncertainties to the published errors , suggesting that the smaller uncertainties we derive are due to our more restricted choice of artificial binary configurations ( @xmath55 pix , @xmath56 pix ) and/or averaging over many single psfs to reduce systematics associated with any one specific object .",
    "our improvement to the wfpc2 astrometry was essential in our early attempts to fit the orbit based on keck data obtained in 20052007 .",
    "however , with the addition of data in 2008 , the final _ hst_+keck dataset has sufficent time baseline and astrometric quality that the choice of wfpc2 astrometry does not highly impact the final orbit fitting results (   [ sec : altorbits ] ) .",
    "the  system was observed on 2006  january  19 and 2006  april  11 ( ut ) with the high resolution camera ( hrc ) of _ hst _ s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) by program go-10559 ( pi h. bouy ) .",
    "the binary is much more widely separated at these epochs than in the wfpc2 observations , but the psfs of the two components are still blended .",
    "we have therefore applied the same tinytim psf - fitting technique described in the previous section to derive the relative astrometry from the acs images .",
    "the primary differences between the wfpc2 and acs datasets are : ( 1 ) acs has much more severe geometric distortion than wfpc2 , which changes the shape of the psf and complicates astrometry because the pixels projected on the sky are not square , and ( 2 ) the acs data are of much lower @xmath51 , with a total exposure time of only 50  sec for each cosmic - ray rejected , combined dithered image ( cf .",
    ", 1300  sec for a single wfpc2 image ) .",
    "because of the lower @xmath51 , we found it unwarranted to fit the acs images for telescope jitter and defocus as adding these free parameters did not improve the quality of the fits ( as verified in the monte carlo simulations discussed below ) .",
    "also , we found that the @xmath1425@xmath40 lower @xmath51 of these data almost exactly negates any improvement to the astrometry that might be expected given the larger binary separation at these epochs .",
    "we used distorted model psfs generated by tinytim to fit for the position and flux of each binary component in images that had been cosmic - ray cleaned ( ` crsplit=4 ` ) by the latest _ hst _  pipeline .",
    "best - fit pixel locations were corrected for geometric distortion using the solution of anderson & king ( 2004 ; instrument science report 04 - 15 ) , and we used their measured acs pixel scale , which was derived by comparing commanded ( ` postarg ` ) offsets of _ hst _  in arcseconds to the resulting pixel offsets .",
    "they derived two such pixel scales for two epochs of observations of 47  tuc , and we adopt the mean and standard deviation of these two : @xmath57  mas / pix . which is well below the other errors in the measurements ( j. anderson , priv .",
    "comm . ) . ] for each epoch , we adopted the mean of the measurements from all four dithered images for the binary parameters of ( table  [ table : hst ] ) .    again ,",
    "to investigate the measurement errors thoroughly , we performed monte carlo simulations of our fitting routine .",
    "we used images of single brown dwarfs to construct artificial binaries in configurations resembling . at both",
    "acs epochs , the binary is well represented by integer - pixel shifts on a grid where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "there have been no _ hst_/acs science programs dedicated to studying single brown dwarfs ; however , acs images of the single brown dwarfs 2mass  j00361617@xmath421821104 ( l3.5 ; @xcite ) and 2mass  j05591914@xmath01404488 ( t4.5 ; @xcite ) were obtained for calibration purposes and are available in the _ hst _  archive ( cal / acs-10374 , pi giavalisco ) .",
    "we found that despite the large difference in spectral types , any corresponding difference in the psf does not alter the results of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the @xmath51 of each of these single objects is much higher than that of , so we degraded the @xmath51 of the single brown dwarfs for the artificial binary simulations .",
    "in fact , by varying the @xmath51 of the simulations , we found that the acs data for  are well in the @xmath51 regime dominated by random photon noise , while the images of the single objects are in a high @xmath51 regime dominated by systematic errors ( akin to the wfpc2 images of ) .",
    "therefore , given that we have four images , we divide the rms of the monte carlo results by @xmath60 to represent the final uncertainties .",

    "while standard gradient - descent ( levenberg - marquardt ) least - squares techniques would be sufficient to derive an orbit (   [ sec : fitting ] ) , we also would like to accurately determine the probability distribution of the orbit parameters ( which may not be normally distributed ) and the associated degeneracies .",
    "for epochs with keck data taken in multiple filters , we choose the filter with the smallest astrometry errors .",
    "thus , we first used a combination of gradient - descent techniques from random starting points and simulated - annealing techniques to isolate the class of potential orbital solutions near a reduced chi - squared ( ) of  1 .",
    "then , to fully explore this class of solutions , we used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "mcmc provides a means to explore the multi - dimensional parameter space inherent in fitting visual orbits that is computationally efficient , able to discern the degeneracies and non - gaussian uncertainites in the fit , and allows for incorporation of a  priori knowledge . in short ,",
    "the mcmc approach is distinct from ordinary monte carlo methods in that instead of a completely random steps through the model parameter space , the steps are chosen such that the resulting number of samples ( the `` chain '' ) is asymptotically equivalent to the posterior probability distribution of the parameters being sought .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for explications of applying mcmc to astronomical data . )",
    "we parameterized the binary s orbit using the standard 7 parameters : period ( @xmath89 ) , semi - major axis ( @xmath90 ) , inclination ( @xmath91 ) , epoch of periastron ( @xmath92 ) , pa of the ascending node ( @xmath93 ) , which can only be resolved with radial velocity information . ] , eccentricity ( @xmath94 ) , and the argument of periastron ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "we used an mcmc chain length of @xmath96 , with the parameters stored every hundredth iteration .",

    "we used the metropolis - hastings algorithm to sample the joint probability distribution with a variant of the usual gibbs sampler . instead of chosing one of the 7  parameters to increment or decrement , we chose instead to move randomly either forwards or backwards along one of 7  orthogonal directions in the parameter space .",
    "these directions were initially chosen to be along the individual coordinate axes of our 7  parameters . then , every @xmath97  iterations , the covariance matrix of the 7  parameters was calculated and new directions chosen along the directions corresponding to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix .",
    "after covariance matrix calculation , the trial step size was set to be the square root of the covariance matrix eigenvalues .",
    "this enabled the long , thin , curved minima in our parameter space to be sampled much more efficiently .",
    "each set of @xmath97 iterations can thus be thought of as its own sub - chain with fixed directions .",
    "as the first @xmath97 iterations uses a less efficient sampling ( sampling directions aligned with the 7  parameters themselves ) , we treated this part of the chain as the `` burn - in '' time , neglecting it in the final analysis .",
    "as the chain was running , the trial step size in each direction was continuously scaled over a timescale of 700  steps so that the success rate of jumps averaged to 0.25 .",
    "the correlation length of our most correlated chain , as defined in @xcite , was @xmath98 for the orbital period ( @xmath89 ) , with equal or smaller correlation lengths for other parameters .",
    "this gives an effective length of the chain of @xmath99 , which in turn gives statistical uncertainties in the parameter errors of about @xmath100% , i.e. , negligible .",
    "these uncertainties in the errors are consistent with the results from running multiple test chains .    by making steps of the same size in the positive and negative directions for these parameters in constructing the markov chain",
    ", we would implicitly assume that our prior knowledge of these parameters is a uniform distribution .",
    "this is not an accurate representation of our prior knowledge since , for example , binaries with periods between @xmath101 and @xmath102 years are not 10  times more common than binaries with periods between 10 and @xmath101 years .",
    "we therefore applied a prior to the likelihood function in the mcmc fitting where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are distributed evenly in logarithm and that the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 are uniformly distributed , rather than @xmath94 and @xmath95 , to save the algorithm from unnaturally preferring circular solutions .",

    "the very small effect of the choice of prior is discussed below .",
    "larger errors .",
    "( in fact , the mcmc fitting gives basically the same results if the acs data are excluded . )",
    "thus simply applying the nirc2 astrometric calibration error of 0.1% in pixel scale and 0.07  in pa to all six keck epochs would incorrectly treat this as a random error , when in fact the uncertainty in the nirc2 calibration globally impacts the overall solution of , e.g. , the semi - major axis and the pa of the line of nodes . therefore , we do the following : ( 1 ) we apply the errors in the nirc2 calibration in quadrature to the _ hst_/acs and _ hst_/wfpc2 measurements before orbit fitting , and ( 2 ) once the semi - major axis distribution has been determined , we apply the uncertainty in the nirc2 pixel scale in determining the error on the total mass .",
    "the net effect is negligible , given the much larger acs errors compared to the keck lgs data and the fact that the error in the total mass is dominated by the parallax error ( which is @xmath106 larger than the nirc2 pixel scale uncertainty ) . ]    as a consistency check , we also ran our mcmc fitting code on the astrometric data for the binary l  dwarf 2massw  j0746 + 2000ab from .",

    "since these two components are later - type than the l / t transition ( e.g. , their positions in ir color - magnitude diagrams is coincident with the locus of mid / late - t dwarfs with blue near - ir colors ) , this may suggest that the  discrepancy might not be solely associated with the l / t transition . instead ,  and",
    "the aforementioned l / t companions may indicate that a systematic error in the estimated ages and radii of field late - l and t  dwarfs is the culprit .",

    "the luminosities of  are comparable to the field objects of similar type ( @xmath166 for t5.0  component  a and @xmath88 for t5.5  component  b ) .",

    "in other words , the measured total mass of  is too small ( by a factor of @xmath142 ) compared to the mass expected from the evolutionary models for 3  gyr objects with @xmath167 .    a representative age of @xmath10.5  gyr for the field population",

    "similarly , the radii of @xmath148 adopted by vrba et al .  is based on a mass function where @xmath168 ; a somewhat steeper mass function would lead to younger typical ages ( e.g. , figure  8 of @xcite , though @xcite suggest @xmath169 based on a small sample of t  dwarfs ) .",

    "the spectrum of  has not yet been fitted with model atmospheres due to its composite nature .",

    "we can not objectively discern if the problem lies in the evolutionary tracks , the model atmospheres , or both .",
    "however , the evolutionary models are thought to be robust to the principal input uncertainties @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the model atmospheres are quite uncertain . even though the spectral appearance of mid- and late - t dwarfs is relatively simple",

    "therefore , while a larger sample of objects is needed both for dynamical mass determinations and model atmosphere fitting , the plausible hypothesis is that the observed discrepancy arises from an overprediction of  by current model atmospheres .",
    "we have directly measured the total mass of the  system .",
    "however , using the evolutionary tracks to determine the physical properties also implicitly determines the mass ratio , since the model - derived age and observed individual luminosities translate into individual masses ( again with the assumption that the system is composed of only two components ) .",

    "we measure a @xmath183  dex difference in between the two components would give an uncertainty of @xmath184  dex in the  difference , but this would include the uncertainties in the distance modulus ( 0.04  mag ) and the integrated - light photometry ( 0.03  mag ) , which are common to both components . ] which leads to a mass ratio @xmath185 .",

    "the locations of the two components disagree with both sets of models ( which agree very well between themselves ) .",
    "the likely interpretation is that the temperatures from the model atmospheres place the components to the left of the evolutionary tracks , i.e. , too warm . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : temp ] , the model atmospheres are a significant source of the uncertainty in placing the components on figure  [ fig : hrd - masses ] . a possible systematic error of only @xmath14100  k would be sufficient to resolve the discrepancy with the data .",

    "equivalently , if one were simply to assume the h - r  diagram positions are accurate , the evolutionary models would suggest individual masses of around 0.05  and 0.06  from the lyon and tucson models , respectively , i.e. , nearly a factor of two overestimate in the masses . while it may be that the evolutionary models are so substantially incorrect , such a conclusion is not compelling at this point , given the plausible errors in the determinations",
    ". would move one evolutionary track closer to one component , while the other track would move farther away from the other component .",
    "the evolutionary models could be brought into agreement with the data for component  a for @xmath189 , but this is implausible given the nearly equal magnitudes of the two components .",

    "the expected maximum radial velocity difference of the two components is only 4.6  .",
    "since the two components are nearly equal mass and brightness , the orbital motion will be very difficult to detect in the integrated - light spectrum .",

    "individual mass measurements can in principle also test the evolutionary tracks directly .",
    "one can estimate the age of each component from its mass and luminosity ( as we have done using the total mass ) and see if the ages indicate coevality for the system .",
    "however , given the near - equal flux ratio of this system ( and most ultracool binaries ) , this coevality test is unlikely to be very discriminating .",
    "moreover , individual masses can not resolve the discrepancy seen in the h - r diagram ( figure  [ fig : hrd - masses ] ) , which largely arises from the uncertainties in the model atmospheres .      with the advent of lgs ao on the largest ground - based telescopes",
    ", we can expect an increasing number of dynamical masses for ultracool field dwarfs in the near - future .",
    "the most useful systems for testing theory will be those with both independent mass and age determinations , namely binaries that are associated with open clusters / groups and/or field stars of known age .",
    "the former will present a significant technical challenge , e.g. , ultracool binaries in the hyades ( @xmath191  pc ; ) and pleiades ( @xmath192  pc ; @xcite ) with suitably short orbital periods are unresolvable with current technology and thus none are currently known .",
    "ultracool binary companions to field stars are extremely rare and thus while very valuable systems , these will only probe a very limited range of spectral type , age , and mass : only four systems are known with suitably short orbital periods ( @xmath193  yr )  the t1+t6 binary  bab , the l4+l4 binary hd  130948bc @xcite , the l4.5+l6 binary gj  417bc @xcite , and the l4.5+l4.5 binary gj  1001bc @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is significant motivation to develop analyses that employ masses derived from the much more numerous field binaries . in this regard and as illustrated by our analysis for , one can identify two orthogonal pathways to confront theory : ( 1 )  comparison to evolutionary tracks and ( 2 )  comparison to atmospheric models .",
    "direct measurements of , , and mass ( or age ) for brown dwarfs enable use of the h - r  diagram , by comparing the observations to evolutionary tracks that correspond to the measured masses of the objects .",
    "as illustrated by figure  [ fig : hrd - masses ] , the lyon and tucson tracks differ at the 510% level in mass , and thus mass determinations of 23% accuracy could discriminate between the two models , if  and  can be well - measured .",

    "accurate measurements for  are largely straight - forward , as good as a few percent ( e.g. ,   [ sec : lbol ] ) .",

    "brown dwarfs obey a mass - luminosity - age ( @xmath194 ) relation , and for most field objects neither the mass nor the age is known . a commonly used approach to circumvent this limitation",
    "is to study brown dwarfs that are companions to main - sequence stars , where ( indirect ) age estimates are available from the primary star .",

    "however , in practice the benchmark test is much more feasible to implement and subject to much smaller systematic errors . in the absence of direct radius measurements ,",

    "the time baseline of our complete dataset covers about half of the total period .",
    "we find that the orbital motion of the binary is viewed in an almost edge - on orientation and has a modest eccentricity .",
    "our determination of a @xmath206  yr orbital period is significantly longer than the original 4-year estimate , as by chance the binary was at a very small projected separation when discovered in 2000 .",
    "the total mass of the system is @xmath207 ( @xmath208  ) , including the uncertainty in the parallax .",
    "this is the second brown dwarf binary directly confirmed , the first among the field population .",
    "it is also the coolest and lowest mass binary with a dynamical mass determination to date .    with very accurate measurements of the total mass and the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath209 )",
    ", we use the tucson and lyon evolutionary tracks to determine the remaining physical properties for the system .",
    "the two sets of models give largely consistent results , which highlights the difficult of distinguishing between them even with such precise observational data .",
    "we average the model results to represent the final determinations .",
    "we find a relatively youthful age for the system of 0.79@xmath380.09  gyr ( 1@xmath29 ) , consistent with its low tangential velocity relative to other field t  dwarfs .",
    "the remaining physical parameters of the individual components are then fully determined : radii of and , effective temperatures of @xmath210  k and @xmath211  k , surface gravities of and @xmath143 , and masses of @xmath10 ( @xmath212 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath213 ) for components  a and  b , respectively .",
    "we take care to account for the covariances inherent in the measurement uncertainties , by using a monte carlo approach to derive these physical quantities from the evolutionary models .",
    "our approach also assumes that the system is coeval and composed of only two components .",
    "these precise determinations for 2mass  j1534@xmath02952a and  b are in general accord with the  and  values found previously for field t  dwarfs based on model atmospheres and with the ages of t  dwarfs predicted by monte carlo simulations of the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , upon closer scrutiny , there are two potential discrepancies with past studies .",
    "both suggest that the temperatures of field t  dwarfs may be overestimated by @xmath14100  k , though we stress that the two discrepancies must arise from independent effects .",
    "( 1 )  the temperatures of 2mass  j1534@xmath02952a and  b appear to be cooler than field objects of comparable spectral type .",
    "this resembles discrepancies previously noted by @xcite and @xcite for late - l / early - t dwarfs that are companions to young main - sequence stars .",
    "they have hypothesized that the effect is due to the gravity sensitivity of the l / t transition .",
    "the fact that this discrepancy also occurs for  suggests instead that the problem may arise from a factor of @xmath214 overestimate in the adopted ages of field objects when determining their temperatures using evolutionary tracks .",
    "ages of @xmath10.31.0  gyr are preferred based on this binary .",
    "( 2 ) the temperatures of 2mass  j1534@xmath02952a and  b are slightly cooler than inferred for other mid - t  dwarfs from model atmospheres .",
    "detailed analysis of the system s integrated - light and resolved spectra with model atmospheres is needed to directly assess the  and of the two components and to refine the comparison with the values derived from evolutionary models .",
    "the positions of the two components on the h - r diagram are discrepant with theoretical evolutionary tracks corresponding to their individual masses .",
    "in fact , taken at face value , using the h - r diagram positions to infer masses from the evolutionary tracks would lead to masses of @xmath140.050.06  , about a factor of two larger than the actual measured masses . while this discrepancy could stem from large systematic errors in the luminosities ( @xmath150% errors ) and/or radii ( @xmath120% errors ) predicted by evolutionary models ,",
    "the likely cause is that temperatures from model atmospheres are too warm by @xmath14100  k for mid - t dwarfs .",
    "this highlights the need for continued improvements to the model atmospheres .",
    "future monitoring of  will help to refine its orbit and its dynamical mass .",
    "the orbital separation of the system is now rapidly decreasing and will not be readily resolvable again until around 2011 . at the same time , an improved parallax for the system will be required  the uncertainty in the total mass from the orbit fitting is 3% , compared to the 5% that arises from the uncertainty in the parallax .",
    "radial velocity monitoring and/or absolute astrometry will directly determine the individual masses and test if the system is a higher order multiple .",
    "however , given the very similar fluxes of the two components ( implying nearly equal mass ) , individual mass measurements are unlikely to resolve the discordant h - r diagram position of the two components relative to evolutionary tracks .",
    "this problem is likely driven by the systematic uncertainties in current model atmospheres for t  dwarfs .",
    "the fundamental characteristic of the field population is that it spans a range of ( largely unknown ) ages .",
    "however despite this uncertainty , field brown dwarf binaries can strongly test theoretical models , if analyzed appropriately .",
    "these systems will be especially valuable in light of the current paucity of eclipsing field ultracool binaries and resolvable , short - period ultracool binaries in open clusters / groups.600",
    "l  and t  dwarfs known . ] specifically , attempts to directly test different evolutionary tracks by placing ultracool objects on the h - r diagram ( the `` h - r diagram test '' ) will be challenging , given the similarity between the tracks and the difficulty in independently determining  with model atmospheres . instead",
    ", atmosphere models can be confronted against  and  values for ultracool objects as derived from the evolutionary models , which can be exceptionally precise ( the `` benchmark test '' ) .",
    "this approach has previously been applied to single brown dwarfs that are companions to stars of known age ( `` age benchmarks '' ) .",
    "we suggest that in an analogous fashion , field ultracool binaries with dynamical mass determinations ( `` mass benchmarks '' ) can test the model atmospheres .",
    "in fact , given the plausible observational uncertainties , mass benchmarks are likely to provide stronger constraints ( by a factor of @xmath145 ) on  and  than age benchmarks , since dynamical masses can be determined far more accurately than ages for main - sequence field stars . with the widespread advent of lgs ao on the largest ground - based telescopes , we can look forward to a rapid increase in dynamical mass determinations for low - mass field binaries and thus substantial advances in our understanding of the properties and evolution of substellar objects .",
