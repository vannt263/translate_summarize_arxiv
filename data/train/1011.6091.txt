    "in the past few years a number of tensions in the ckm fits for the standard model ( sm ) with 3 generations have been revealed @xcite .",
    "there are quite serious indications that the `` predicted '' value of @xmath6 is larger compared to the value measured directly via the `` gold - plated '' @xmath7 mode by as much as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath9 determined from the penguin dominated modes tends to be even smaller compared to that from the @xmath10 mode and therefore that constitutes even a larger deviation from the sm predicted value @xcite .",
    "there are other anomalies as well that appear related .",
    "the difference in the partial rate asymmetries between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is also too large @xcite to understand @xcite , though qcd complications do not allow us to draw compelling conclusions in this regard @xcite .",
    "but with the backdrop of the hint of presence of a new cp - odd phase in the @xmath13 penguin dominated modes , it is highly suggestive that the direct cp problem in k @xmath14 modes is receiving , at least in part , contribution from the same new physics source .",
    "there are also some indications from the cdf and do experiments at the tevatron @xcite . while the earlier indication of possible non - standard effects in @xmath15 seem to have weakened somewhat at the higher luminosity around 6/fb now being used @xcite , d0 has announced a surprisingly large cp - asymmetry in the same sign dimuons which they attribute primarily to originate from @xmath16 @xcite . from a theoretical standpoint",
    "if new physics exists in @xmath13 b - decays , then it becomes highly unnatural for it not to exist in @xmath17 , @xmath2 mixings as well .",
    "a simple extension of the sm with four generations ( sm4 ) can readily account for such anomalies  @xcite .",
    "of course , even without these anomalies , sm4 is an interesting extension of the sm worth study .",
    "the two extra phases that it possesses can give rise to a host of non - standard cp asymmetries and in fact sm4 can significantly ameliorate the difficulties with regard to baryogenesis that sm3 has  @xcite .",
    "besides , the heavier quarks and leptons of the 4th generation may well lead to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and thereby become useful in addressing the hierarchy problem without the need for supersymmetry at the weak scale @xcite .    motivated by these considerations we will continue our investigations of the physical implications of sm4 . in particular we will use all the known experimental constraints such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , electroweak precision constraints from @xmath23 as well as oblique corrections  @xcite as in our previous work @xcite . however , we will now use an explicit representation of the 4x4 ckm matrix of  @xcite given long ago .",
    "we make this particular choice as it is very well designed to extract constraints from b decays since it was shown in a series of papers  @xcite that sm4 is highly susceptible to those decays .",
    "we will provide constraints and many correlations amongst the 6 real parameters and the 3 phases that enter the sm4 .",
    "we will then apply this framework to study mixing induced cp asymmetries @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 may be any self conjugate final state such as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 _ etc . _ ) and semi - leptonic asymmetries in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and in @xmath2 .",
    "in obtaining these constraints and implications we will allow @xmath34 to range from 375 to 575 gev as suggested by current hints from study of b - decays  @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of sm4 is that it is rather well constrained already .",
    "thus , for example , while the semi - leptonic asymmetry in @xmath2 ( @xmath35 ) can be enhanced by as much as a factor of about 300 over sm3 it still can not account for the central value of the recent d0 result @xcite .",
    "of course , that observation has only about 2-@xmath36 significance and therefore rather large errors but improved experimental results could certainly rule out or confirm sm4 , since the predicted range in sm4 for @xmath35 is between about ( 0.006 ) to ( -0.006 ) ; also its sign has to be the same as @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath5 , @xmath38 can only be larger by around a factor of four over sm3 .",
    "these semi - leptonic asymmetries also have interesting correlations with s(@xmath15 ) and s(@xmath39 ) respectively that should be testable .",
    "as mentioned above one of the key difficulty for the ckm - paradigm of sm3 uncovered in recent years is that the predicted value of @xmath6 is too large compared to the measured one @xcite .",
    "we will show here that sm4 tends to alleviate this tension appreciably but at the same time then it allows to place an important bound on @xmath38 through the correlation mentioned in the previous para .",
    "b - factories placed a bound on @xmath38  @xcite some years ago but by now they have considerable more data .",
    "so an improved bound would be extremely worthwhile . in",
    "the past couple of years belle also took substantial data on @xmath40 5s  @xcite .",
    "in fact that data could provide a very clean study of @xmath35 as well as on @xmath41 , which is defined as the linear combination of @xmath35 and @xmath38 @xcite , since that sample provides a valuable source of this combination as well as an enriched sample of @xmath2 .",
    "cdf , d0 and lhcb should be able to provide very useful results on these semi - leptonic asymmetries .",
    "in fact whereas the tevatron @xmath42 collider allowed d0 to yield the sum of @xmath38 and @xmath35 , the @xmath43 collider at lhc can not do that , but lhcb should be able to study the difference of these two asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that in this series of studies on the 4th generation @xcite , for simplicity , and for definiteness , we have been making a tacit assumption that a heavy charge 2/3 and -1/3 quark doublet has weak interaction just like the previous three families allowing us to incorporate these readily into a 4x4 mixing - matrix resulting from an immediate generalization of the 3x3 case . clearly if and when such a doublet of quarks is observed we will need to make detail tests on the weak interaction properties of the new quarks to verify that this assumption is correct .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . after the introduction , in sec .",
    "[ sec : v4g - param ] and [ input ] we provide information regarding the parametrisation and the constraints on the 4@xmath444 ckm matrix by incorporating oblique corrections along with experimental data from important observables involving z , b and k decays as well as @xmath5 and @xmath2 mixings etc . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present the estimates of many useful observables in the sm4 . finally in sec .",
    "[ concl ] , we present our summary .",
    "we use the parametrisation of the sm4 mixing matrix from @xcite , then the elements of fourth row such as @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are more relevant for the discussion of @xmath49 physics , will be rather simple . defining @xmath50 the generalised @xmath51 mixing matrix @xmath52",
