    "the standard model yields a precise description of the fundamental interactions . nevertheless , in the neutrino sector there are still observed phenomena whose proper description requires the introduction of new elements .",
    "indeed , on one side the tiny neutrino squared mass differences suggests very small neutrino masses whose explanation requires the introduction of new heavy fields ; on the other side , we have not been able to explain the short - baseline anomalies such as the lsnd signal @xcite , the miniboone excesses @xcite , and the reactor anomaly @xcite .",
    "the standard picture includes 3 active neutrinos whose mixing is described by the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix .",
    "the mixing angles and mass differences have been measured in different experiments which are designed to maximize a desired effect depending on the source , baseline and energy .",
    "the last parameter to be measured was the mixing angle @xmath9 @xcite , that was for a long time assumed to be zero .    in this work we explore the consequences on cp asymmetries in neutrino oscillations due to the very existence of an additional heavy neutrino .",
    "as measured on lep , the invisible width of the @xmath10 boson imposes that an additional active neutrino must be heavier than @xmath11 , while lep2 excluded a heavy charged lepton , that would be the doublet partner of the neutrino considered , up to @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the most attractive scheme would be to consider a fourth sequential chiral generation , and indeed , there are several motivations to consider this as a first attempt to modify the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these have already been summarized in @xcite and include : new cp violation ( cpv ) source for the baryon asymmetry of the universe problem @xcite , new perspectives in the higgs naturalness problem or in the fermion mass hierarchy problem @xcite . however , the recent lhc ( atlas and cms ) results put strong limits on the fourth generation standard model ( sm4 ) since they have excluded at 95% a fourth generation down ( @xmath13 ) and up quark ( @xmath14 ) with masses",
    "smaller than @xmath15 gev @xcite and @xmath16 gev @xcite . since these quarks couple to the higgs boson with a strength proportional to its mass",
    ", they do not decouple from the production of the higgs boson .",
    "the existence of these extra fermions , regardless of their mass , would imply a higgs boson @xmath17 gev .",
    "also precision electroweak observables constrain the difference of fourth generation quark and lepton masses @xcite .    in this paper",
    "though , we will make a discussion of the neutrino sector considering a fourth active neutrino regardless of the model in which it is embedded .",
    "our goal is to test if the two extra cp violating phases that appear in the @xmath18 pmns matrix can yield a sizable asymmetry in neutrino oscillations , hence we scan the whole parameter space for these phases obtaining those values that yields the maximum cp asymmetry in the different channels . for clarity and simplicity , we will start with the results obtained for neutrinos propagating in vacuum .",
    "we point how the somewhat surprising result of having a measurable asymmetry in the survival channel @xmath19 is obtained due to unitarity and kinematical constraints",
    ". then we will proceed in an analogous analysis to the case of neutrinos propagating through matter for distances and energies that are comparable to current experiments .",
    "finally , we will calculate the order of the corrections that could be induced in the scattering amplitude due to virtual effects of the heavy neutrino and its mixing with the light ones .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss neutrino oscillations in vacuum , the kinematics of the heavy neutrino and its impact on neutrino cp asymmetries . in section iii we calculate the same observables in matter . in section",
    "iv we calculate the box diagrams contributing at the next order in perturbation theory .",
    "our conclusions are given in section v and we give some details of the calculations in an appendix .",
    "the neutrino of flavour @xmath20 , @xmath21 , is by definition the one that is produced in the weak interactions with its charged lepton partner @xmath22 , where @xmath23 o @xmath24 .",
    "these are the interaction eigenstates which are related to the propagating states @xmath25 , @xmath26 through the pmns matrix @xmath27 as [ neutrinostate ] _ = _",
    "the lagrangian for charged weak currents is given in terms of the propagating neutrino state as _ cc=-_,i|l_l_u_i_liw^_++h.c .",
    ", several considerations are made in order to describe a neutrino state at a distance @xmath28 from the production point and at a selected neutrino energy @xmath29 .",
    "first , it is assumed that the neutrino mass eigenstate propagates as a plane wave , then we take the @xmath30axis along the neutrino direction and consider that the propagating states are ultra - relativistic , i.e. , @xmath31 . under these assumptions",
    "one can easily find the neutrino state after a time @xmath32 during which it travels a distance @xmath33 @xcite _",
    "( t)&=&u_1 e^-i_1_1+u_2 e^-i_2_2 + & + & u_3 e^-i_3_3 , where @xmath34 .",
    "the probability for oscillation of initial flavour @xmath20 to final flavour @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 and a straightforward calculation yields [ nuetonumu ] p_&=&2 ( u_1u^*_1u^*_2u_2[e^-i(_1-_2)-1 ] ) + & + & 2 ( u_1u^*_1u^*_3u_3[e^-i(_1-_3)-1 ] ) + & + & 2 ( u_2u^*_2u^*_3u_3[e^-i(_2-_3)-1 ] ) , where the relation @xmath37 and the unitarity of the pmns matrix are used . equation ( [ nuetonumu ] ) can also be written in the compact form [ versimt ] p_=&-&4 _ i < j ( u_iu^*_iu^*_ju_j ) ^2 ( ) + & -&2 _",

    "we will use for the conventional angles and differences of squared masses the best fit points from @xcite .",
    "although there are more recent reports on the value of @xmath9 , i.e. @xcite , the measured values are consistent with those of @xcite and we prefer to work with the set of parameters that were used in the fit in a single analysis that considers the three neutrinos . as can be seen from fig . 6 in @xcite , in this long baseline neutrino experiment",
    "is not possible to disentangle the values of @xmath53 and @xmath9 , so we decided to keep the best fit point which yields @xmath54 .",
    "the upper bounds on the additional parameters due to the existence of a fourth neutrino are obtained from deviations of the unitarity of the pmns matrix . in this concern , considering electroweak decays , such as , w decay , invisible z decay , test of universality and rare decays , which lead to upper bounds for the product @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the non - unitary pmns matrix composed of a hermitian ( @xmath57 ) and a unitary ( @xmath58 ) matrix , robust bounds for deviations of unitarity of the pmns matrix were obtained in @xcite which updates previous studies in @xcite .",
    "we use the results reported in @xcite to extract the upper bounds on the the additional angles due to the existence of a fourth neutrino .",
    "relating these bounds to the 3 new angles , we obtained : @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "notice that we have left the extra cp phases , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as free parameters and that from now on we will have a complex pmns matrix .",
    "we use the input parameters shown in table [ input ] , with @xmath64 . for the normal hierarchy ( nh )",
    "@xmath65 , whereas for the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) we used instead @xmath66 ev@xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "two variables marked with @xmath69 are correlated and we take their best fit values.[input ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the evaluations were performed using dimensional regularization and the feynman gauge ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we considered the zero external momentum approximation , which is a good approximation for neutrino energies below 20 gev .    the diagrams with the corresponding goldstone bosons turn out to be negligible , since they depend on powers of neutrino masses of the first three generations .",
    "for simplicity we stick to the normal hierarchy with the mass eigenstate @xmath71 being the most massive and used the lower bound on @xmath72 gev .",
    "we would expect this one to be mostly @xmath73 with little components of the three standard flavours , since the mixing angles are very small .",
    "we used for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , that appear in the relevant pmns matrix elements , the values that maximize the cp asymmetry of the t parameters for the nh in each of the channels .",
    "it is only in the case of the flavour changing process that the extra cp violating phases enter into the expressions . in summary our results",
    "are the following :    \\a ) for this diagram the most relevant contribution to the amplitude comes from the light neutrinos @xmath74 as intermediate states .",
    "for an incoming electronic neutrino the absolute value of the amplitude from this diagram is of order @xmath75 .",
    "the absolute value for the tree level amplitudes is @xmath76 , hence the ratio to the tree level diagram is of order @xmath77 .",
    "amplitudes with incoming @xmath78 , @xmath79 are even smaller .",
    "\\b ) this diagram allows for neutrino flavour changing processes . for an incoming electronic neutrino and flavour conserving diagrams",
    "the ratio to the tree level diagram is of the order of @xmath80 while for flavour violating diagrams the absolute value of the amplitude is of the order of @xmath81 .",
    "considering an incoming muonic neutrino with a final neutrino either muonic or taonic the order is even smaller , namely @xmath82 .",
    "\\c ) this diagram admits also change in neutrino flavour . for an incoming electronic neutrino",
    "the ratio to the tree level process in the @xmath83 is @xmath84 , amplitudes for other flavour conserving processes and amplitudes for flavour violating processes are at least two orders of magnitude smaller .    summarizing this section",
    "we conclude that the amplitudes of the three box diagrams are at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the tree level amplitude and numerically have no impact in the asymmetries in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the very existence of a fourth neutrino modifies the conventional pmns mixing matrix introducing three new angles and two new phases yielding new possible sources for cp violation .",
    "since the mixing with light neutrinos is small it is desirable to have an estimate of the size of the cp violation effects in current neutrino experiment .    in this work we studied the maximum values",
    "that cp asymmetries in neutrino oscillations can reach when a fourth neutrino is considered , both in vacuum and in the presence of matter .",
    "we show that another consequence of the existence of a fourth neutrino is that it is possible to observe asymmetries in the surviving channels even if cpt is conserved , due to a combined effect of unitarity , kinematics and cp violation .    in the numerics we set the value of the phase appearing in the case of three neutrinos to @xmath54 , so that the imaginary part of the pmns matrix is due entirely to the existence of the fourth neutrino . using the upper bound values for the three extra mixing angles",
    "as obtained form the deviations from unitarity studies @xcite , we got @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we study the maximum asymmetries that can be reach in neutrino oscillation as functions of the neutrino energy , the distance to the detector and the two new phases , scanning the whole parameter space for the latter .",
    "our analysis shows that , under the above assumptions , in vacuum , the maximum asymmetries that can be reached in a t2k - like setup ( @xmath85 km ,  @xmath86 gev ) are of the order of of @xmath4 and appear in the survival @xmath87 channel .",
    "asymmetries in other channels are at least one order of magnitude smaller . as for the minos - like setup ( @xmath88 km ,  @xmath89 gev )",
    ", the maximum asymmetries can be reached in the @xmath90 and @xmath91 channel and are of the order of @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "importantly , for the same baseline but a different energy within the reach of minos , namely @xmath92 gev , we get a maximum asymmetry of the order of @xmath4 in the surviving @xmath87 channel .",
    "effects of matter enhance the maximal asymmetry in the channels involving electronic neutrinos as expected . for the t2k - like setup the maximum asymmetry in the @xmath91 channel raises from @xmath93 in vacuum to @xmath94 in the presence of matter , while for @xmath90 it grows from @xmath95 in vacuum to @xmath96 in a material medium .",
    "in these channels results for the maximal asymmetries are similar with normal and inverted hierarchy .",
    "the interaction with matter has a small an indirect effect in the survival @xmath87 channel via unitarity , whose sign depends on the hierarchy .",
    "it goes from the order of @xmath4 in vacuum , independently of the hierarchy , to @xmath97 in matter for normal hierarchy , while it decreases to @xmath1 in the case of an inverted hierarchy .",
    "the value of the asymmetry in the @xmath91 channel varies with the energy of the neutrino beam in general being larger at low energies . for the t2k baseline , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ materiamue ] ) the maximum asymmetries can be of the order of @xmath98 changing the sign when going from beam energies of @xmath99 gev to @xmath100 gev . although not shown explicitly , for a fixed energy below 1 gev we obtain similar peaks in the maximum asymmetries for definite values of @xmath28 . for the t2k energy @xmath86",
    "gev the peaks appear around @xmath101 km .",
    "we do not report the obtained asymmetries in matter in the case of minos - like because in this case the baseline is at the edge of the validity of the approximations used in the solution of the propagating equations and a deeper analysis beyond the scope of this work is necessary in this case .",
    "the potential contributions to the @xmath102 scattering amplitude due to the exchange of virtual heavy neutrinos in box diagrams were found to be negligible .",
    "finally we would like to remark that the possibility to have an asymmetry in the surviving channel @xmath87 is a consequence of the very existence of a fourth neutrino , thus it would be interesting to try an experimental search of this channel since the measurement of an asymmetry in this channel would be a direct proof of the existence of a fourth neutrino with important implications in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "work supported by conacyt mxico under project 156618 .",
    "in order to sketch the way to obtain the asymmetry we will consider the @xmath104 channel with some simplifying assumptions , namely that @xmath105 , in contrast with the assumptions in the rest of this work . as a notation we will simplify @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in this case the probability for particle and antiparticle oscillations are given by    p_e ( | |e)&= & s^2_24s^2_14c^2_14(c_12 ^ 4+s^4_12 ) + 2 c^2_24c^2_14c^2_23s^2_12c^2_12(1-_21 ) + & + & 2s_24c_24s_14c^2_14c_23s_12c^3_12 ( _ 2-_3)-2s_24c_24s_14c^2_14c_23s^3_12c_12 ( _ 2-_3 ) + & + & 2s_24 ^ 2s^2_14c^2_14s^2_12c^2_12_212s_24c_24s_14c^2_14c_23s_12c_12(_2-_3)2 _ 21 + & -&2s_24c_24s_14c^2_14c_23s_12c^3_12 ( _ 2-_3)_21 + 2s_24c_24s_14c^2_14c_23s^3_12c_12 ( _ 2-_3)_21 where we neglect the last term in eq .
