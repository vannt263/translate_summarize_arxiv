    "in recent years , a lot of work has been conducted on the interaction of alkanethiols with gold surface because of their ability to form self - assembled monolayers ( sams ) ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "these sam films have wide application on wetting phenomena , tribology , chemical and biological sensing , optics and nanotechnology .",
    "the consistent model for the methanethiol adsorption process on the au(111 ) substrate was proposed recently @xcite .",
    "it was revealed that the methanethiols stay intact on the regular au(111 ) surface , but the s - h bond ruptures on the defected au(111 ) surface . on other noble metals such as copper , the adsorption pattern of the alkanethiols ( or alkanethilates ) on the cu(111 )",
    "is distinct from that on the au(111 ) surface @xcite-@xcite .",
    "then one may ask how the s - h bond in the methanethiol on the regular ( or defected ) cu(111 ) surface breaks .",
    "the normal incidence x - ray standing wave measurements show that at the low temperature , the intact methanethiols prefer a local atop site on the cu(111 ) surface , but at 140k methanethiols turn into methanethiolates depositing on unreconstructed areas of the cu(111 ) surface , occupying two nonequivalent hollow sites with similar probability @xcite . at room temperature ,",
    "when methanethiols or dimethyl disulfides adsorbed on the cu(111 ) , the formation of the pseudosquare reconstruction was observed via scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite .",
    "a grazing incidence surface x - ray study indicates that intact alkanethiols favor hollow sites on cu(111 ) @xcite .",
    "however , there has been no experimental proof for hydrogen desorption from such processes .",
    "as we know , alkanethiols only stay intact on the regular au(111 ) surface , but the s - h bond ruptures on the defected au(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "so far , no theoretical work on the scission of the methanethiol on the cu(111 ) surface has been done , thus it is imperative to study the mechanism of the s - h bond rupture theoretically .    in this paper",
    ", we study the adsorption of methanethiol on the cu(111 ) surface by the density functional theory @xcite .",
    "first , we will present adsorption energies and geometries for the nondissociative and dissociative configuration on the regular cu(111 ) surface .",
    "we demonstrate , for the first time , the dissociative structure is the most stable one for the regular cu(111 ) surface , which is opposite to the case when the methanethiols adsorbed on the regular au(111 ) @xcite .",
    "the s atom of the intact methanethiol stays on the top of the copper atom of the surface .",
    "the energy barrier is about 0.2 ev .",
    "this implies that at low temperature , the intact methanethiol prefers a local atop site on the regular cu(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "as the temperature increased , the energy barrier can be overcome and the hydrogen is detached from the s atom , which is consistent with the experimental observation @xcite . to discuss the stability of configurations for the defected cu(111 ) surface",
    ", we assume a vacancy in the top layer of the cu(111 ) surface .",
    "we find that on the defected surface , the dissociative structure is still more stable than nondissociative one .",
    "the hydrogen initially attached to the sulfur forms a bond with the cu(111 ) substrate instead of desorbing from it .",
    "the calculations were performed by the vasp code @xcite in two approaches : 1 ) using the projector augmented wave potential @xcite and the perdew - wang 91 ( pw91 ) generalized gradient approximation to exchange and correlation ( xc ) @xcite ; 2 ) the ultrasoft pseudopotential @xcite with xc based on the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the wave functions are expanded in a plane wave basis with an energy cutoff of 400 ev .",
    "the brillouin zone integration is performed by use of the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite .",
    "we utilized a @xmath0 k point mesh for the geometry optimization .",
    "the adopted supercell corresponds to 12 cu atoms per layer .",
    "the cu atoms in the top three atomic layers are allowed to relax , while those in the bottom layer are fixed to simulate bulk - like termination @xcite .",
    "the vacuum region comprises seven atomic layers , which exceeds substantially the extension of the methanethiol molecule . to examine the accuracy of our approach we increased the energy cutoff to 500 ev and the number of k points to @xmath1 . in both cases ,",
    "the difference amounted to less than @xmath2 .",
    "we further calculated the copper lattice constant , and found it to agree with the experimental value @xcite within @xmath3 .",
    "we begin with the geometries and adsorption energies of the optimized structures for the methanethiol on the cu(111 ) surface at 0.25 ml , as displayed in table [ geom ] .",
    ".the geometries and adsorption energies for the optimized nondissociative and dissociative configurations on the regular and defected cu(111 ) at 0.25 ml .",
    "the entries s site , @xmath4 , tilt , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( ev ) refer to the s headgroup atom site , the angle between the s - c bond direction and the normal to the cu(111 ) , the region of th s - c bond tilted , the shortest s - cu bond length and the adsorption energy , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ geom ]    the symbol fcc - bri ( or hcp - bri ) in table [ geom ] represents that the s atom is placed in a fcc ( or hcp ) hollow region , but leaned toward the bridge .",
    "the stable configurations on the cu(111 ) surface are shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "we calculated nineteen nondissociative configurations on the regular cu(111 ) surface , which are characterized by the s atom adsorption site ( atop , bridge , fcc and hcp hollow ) , the angle of the s - c bond , and the direction of the h - s bond .",
    "the energy difference among the configurations is around 0.1 ev , i.e. , the adsorption energies span 0.30 ev - 0.61 ev .",
    "however , the adsorption energies weakly depend on the tilting of the alkyl chain , which reveals the ionic nature of the bonding .",
    "the first row of table [ geom ] displays that the adsorption energy for the most stable nondissociative structure is 0.61 ev ( fig .",
    "[ structure]a ) , and the s adsorption site is on the top of the cu atom .",
    "thus at low temperature , the intact methanethiol stays on the top site of the regular cu(111 ) surface , in keeping with a recent experimental result @xcite .",
    "the second and third rows of table [ geom ] list two most stable dissociative structures on the regular cu(111 ) substrate , and their adsorption energies are 1.14 ev and 1.11 ev .",
    "the s atom for both configurations are in hollow site , i.e. , fcc - bri ( fig .",
    "[ structure]b ) and hcp - bri ( fig .",
    "[ structure]c ) , which is in favor of the explanation in ref . @xcite ( when dynamical effects are considered , only the hollow site occupancy is observed @xcite ) .",
    "the first and second rows in table [ geom ] reveal that the adsorption energy of the dissociative structure is higher than that of the nondissociative one by 0.53 ev . to further examine this result",
    ", we apply the ultrasoft pseudopotential in conjunction with the pbe xc @xcite to recalculate the above structures , and find an adsorption energy difference of 0.51 ev between the cases of cleavage and noncleavage .",
    "thus we conclude that the dissociative configuration is more stable than the nondissociative one , which is consistent with the experimental observation that at low temperature , the intact methanethiol stays on the regular cu(111 ) surface , and when the temperature increased , methanethiolates deposited on unreconstructed areas of the cu(111 ) surface , occupying two nonequivalent hollow sites with similar probability @xcite .      to see why the dissociative structure is more stable than the nondissociative one , we calculated the partial density of states ( pdos ) for the h atom initially attached to the sulfur atom ( fig .",
    "[ dos]a ) .",
    "the pdos projected on the s atom adsorbed on the regular cu(111 ) surface is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dos]a displays that the primary peaks of the hydrogen pdos for the dissociative structure are at positions of lower energy than those for the nondissociative one .",
    "the electronic configuration related to the former case is thus more stable than that corresponding the latter , and the hydrogen atom forms a stronger bond with the cu(111 ) surface than with the sulfur atom .          to elucidate the interacting bond between the methanethiol ( or methylthiolate ) and the cu(111 ) substrate",
    ", we evaluate the spatially resolved charge - density difference : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron charge densities of the relaxed adsorbate - substrate system , of the clean relaxed surface , and of the isolated but adsorption like deformed adsorbate ( without substrate ) , respectively .",

    "[ chg]a shows that for the intact adsorption , the electrostatic interaction responsible for the bonding comes from the monopole term ( the 0.3e charge transfer ) and the dipole moments in the adsorbate and substrate @xcite . around the s atom",
    ", there is a  ring \" of accumulation of electron charge .",
    "the electrostatic interaction is dominated by the attractive ionic term modified by a repulsive dipolar term @xcite .",
    "the sulfur stays on the top of the copper atom , i.e. , the sulfur only forms a bond with one cu atom .",
    "the interaction between the methylthiolate and cu(111 ) is the ionic bonding @xcite .",
    "the sulfur in the methylthiolate forms bonds with two copper atoms of the cu(111 ) surface ( see fig . [ chg]b and fig .",
    "[ chg]c ) , and its charge transfer ( 0.6e ) is two times of that for the nondissociative case ( 0.3e ) .",
    "it indicates that the methylthiolate takes in 0.3e electron charge from each copper atom channel ( 0.3e @xmath14 2 = 0.6e ) , which matches with the fact that the adsorption energy for the dissociative structure ( 1.14ev ) is about two times of that for intact adsorption ( 0.61ev ) .",

    "if the defects can change the above conclusion , we consider the cu(111 ) surface with a vacancy in the top layer of the supercell .",
    "the geometries and adsorption energies for the optimized nondissociative and dissociative configurations on the cu(111 ) surface with a vacancy are indicated in the fifth and sixth rows of table [ geom ] .",
    "it shows that the adsorption energy for the dissociative structure ( fig .",

    ", the intact methanethiol on the regular surface was observed , and around 140k , the s - h bond in the methanethiol on the cu(111 ) was broken , we calculated the energy barrier for the process that lead from the nondissociative structure fig . [",

    "[ structure]b .",
    "the energy barrier was calculated by the climbing nudged elastic band method , @xcite-@xcite where six equidistant images have been used .",

    "the relative energies along the s - h bond cleavage reaction path are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "the energy barrier is about 0.2 ev , which is lower than the corresponding energy barrier for the scission of the s - h bond in a single methanethiol molecule .",
    "the reason is that when the methanethiol is adsorbed on the cu(111 ) , the surface plays a role as a catalyst , which can suppress the barrier height .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the s - h bond break reaction is activated over the energy barrier , which is consistent with the experimental measurement @xcite .",
    "we have seen that at low temperature , the intact methanethiol favors the atop site of the cu(111 ) surface , and when the temperature increased , the s - h bond in the methanethiol on the cu(111 ) surface is ruptured .",
    "the hydrogen could either stick to the cu(111 ) surface or desorb in molecular form .",
    "no experimental evidence of either process has been found .",
    "to predict if the hydrogen forms a bond with the cu(111 ) surface or desorbs in the hydrogen molecule , we compared the interaction energy for the dissociative structure @xmath15 with that for methylthiolate on the cu(111 ) and the desorbed hydrogen molecule , i.e. , @xmath16 + @xmath17 .",
    "we found that @xmath15 is lower than @xmath16 + @xmath17 by 0.24 ev , which implies that the hydrogen would like to form a bond with copper surface rather than desorb from the surface .    to check",
    "if the deposited hydrogen modified the methylthiolate adsorption pattern , we calculated fifteen methylthiolate structures on the regular cu(111 ) surface .",
    "the most stable structure is shown in the fourth row of table [ geom ] .",
    "the second and fourth rows in the table display that the s - cu bond lengths and the angles @xmath4 for the dissociative structure ( both the hydrogen and the ch@xmath18s adsorbed on the cu(111 ) surface ) and for the methylthiolate ( only ch@xmath18s ) on the cu(111 ) are 2.26 @xmath6 , 40.2@xmath19 , 2.28 @xmath6 and 46.2@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the hydrogen adsorbed to cu(111 ) modifies the methylthiolate adsorption structure by 6@xmath19 .",
    "we compare the methanethiol adsorption process on the cu(111 ) substrate with that on the other noble metal surface - au(111 ) . on the regular cu(111 ) surface ,",
    "the methanethiol dissociative adsorption is more stable than the intact one .",
    "the corresponding energy barrier is about 0.2 ev . so at low temperature , the methanethiol stays intact on the atop site of the regular cu(111 ) .",
    "when the temperature is raised , this energy barrier is overcome , and the s - h bond breaks .",
    "the corresponding hydrogen is adsorbed on the surface .",
    "the presence of the defects on the cu(111 ) does not change the situation . however , on the regular au(111 ) surface , the nondissociative structure is more stable than the dissociative one . at low temperature ,",
    "the methanethiol favors the atop site of the regular au(111 ) . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the methanethiol molecule desorbs from the regular au(111 ) . for the defected au(111 ) , this order of stabilities is reversed . to unveil the origin of the difference between the adsorption on the cu and au surface , we calculated the partial density of states ( pdos ) for the h atom initially attached to the sulfur atom adsorbed on the regular au(111 ) surface [ see fig .",

    "[ audos ] with fig .",
    "[ dos]a , we have found that for the cu surface the primary peaks of the hydrogen pdos for the dissociative structure are at positions of lower energy than those for the nondissociative one .",
    "however , for the au surface , the primary peaks of the hydrogen pdos for the intact structure are at positions of lower energy than those for the dissociative one .",
    "thus such a comparison explained the physical reason of the difference between the cu and au surface .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated for the first time that when a methanethiol adsorbed on the regular cu(111 ) surface , the dissociative structure is thermodynamically more stable than the intact one .",
    "the energy barrier for the process that lead from the nondissociative structure to the dissociative one is about 0.2 ev .",
