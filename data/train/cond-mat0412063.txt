    "transition - metal perovskite oxides latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 are classical mott - hubbard insulators . in spite of the fact that they are formally isoelectronic with one 3@xmath2 electron in the @xmath3 shell latio@xmath0 has a g - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structure whereas ytio@xmath0 has a ferromagnetic ( fm ) one .",
    "the most unusual feature of these compounds relates with a nearly isotropic magnon spectrum in both titanates despite of their distorted crystal structures @xcite .",
    "there are two theoretical models aimed to explain these effects in latio@xmath0 .",
    "one of them originates from the work of kugel and khomskii @xcite and operates in terms of the lattice distortions and an orbital ordering ( oo ) . another one is proposed by khalliulin and maekawa @xcite and describes the above effects by the model of orbital liquid ( ol ) where the fluctuations of orbital degrees of freedom play an important role .",
    "according to @xcite the energy of the orbital fluctuations is estimated to be @xmath4  mev .",
    "thus ol model is applicable only if the splitting of the @xmath3 orbital in the crystal field @xmath5 is significantly smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise the nearly isotropic exchange is likely to be due to an orbital ordering with a peculiar orbital configuration @xcite .",
    "the ol model was supported by neutron experiments of keimer _ et al _ @xcite where no oo in latio@xmath0 was found .",
    "fritsch with co - workers @xcite made heat capacity and magnetic measurements .",
    "having supposed the nearly cubic structure of latio@xmath0 they concluded that the energy of the spin - orbit coupling for ti - sites was @xmath7  mev and the crystal field effect was small .",
    "the theoretical estimations made by solovyev in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and lsda+u theory showed that @xmath5 in latio@xmath0 was as small as 49  mev and this value was of the same order of magnitude as the energy of the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling @xmath8  mev .",
    "recent x - ray studies @xcite revealed a sizable deformation of the tio@xmath9 octahedra and deviation from the cubic symmetry in latio@xmath0 below @xmath10 .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath3- levels due to crystal deformations was estimated in @xcite to be about 240  mev , and 120 - 300  mev in @xcite .",
    "this was also supported in the _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite in the framework of lda and lda+dmft theory , where @xmath5 was reported to be @xmath11  mev .",
    "those values of @xmath5 were larger than @xmath6 and could provide ordering of the @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the oo - model has had a support in the _ ab - initio _ theoretical studies @xcite for both ytio@xmath0 and latio@xmath0 as well as in the direct observations of the orbital ordering in ytio@xmath0 @xcite , and in latio@xmath0 @xcite from the nmr spectra analysis .",
    "the physical properties of both latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 are strongly sensitive to the chemical composition @xcite .",
    "the highest value of the nel temperature in latio@xmath0 was reported by cwik _",
    "et al _ @xcite and hemberger with co - authors @xcite to be @xmath12  k , while the magnetic moment was @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this magnetic moment disagreed with the theoretical estimations of more than @xmath14 @xcite . for ytio@xmath0 the curie",
    "temperature amounts to 30  k and @xmath15 @xcite .    according to the oo model the difference in the magnetic properties of latio@xmath0 and",
    "ytio@xmath0 can be attributed to the different types of distortions ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the main distortion in ytio@xmath0 has the jahn - teller type , while the gdfeo@xmath0-type distortion dominates in latio@xmath0 . in this letter",
    "we investigate the nature of those crystal distortions and the effects of oo on electronic and magnetic properties of the latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 taking the effects of local coulomb correlations into account .",
    "both latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 have a p@xmath16 crystal structure .",
    "the lattice constants and atomic positions are taken from @xcite .",
    "the structural parameters for latio@xmath0 used in the calculations correspond to the temperature below @xmath10",
    "( @xmath17  k ) .",
    "the examination of the ytio@xmath0 is made for the high temperature structure ( @xmath18  k ) only because there is no structural data for ytio@xmath0 at @xmath19 .",
    "the crystal structure relaxations are not performed but the calculated forces on atoms for the experimental atomic positions are used for the verification of the agreement between theory and experiment . the orthorhombic unit cell used in our calculations",
    "consists of four formula units .",
    "this cell allows us to consider both fm and afm structures with different types of the magnetic ordering .    for electronic structure calculations we use the",
    "projected augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite in the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the exchange - correlation correction is taken into account within the general gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite . in order to treat the effect of local coulomb interactions in a partially filled @xmath20 band of ti the lda+u method",

    "we have found the non - magnetic ground state for latio@xmath0 and ferromagnetic ground state for ytio@xmath0 with the value of the magnetic moment @xmath14 per ti atom .",

    "[ f.dens ] for both titanates integrated in the energy window from @xmath34  ev till fermi level . in this energy interval",
    "the charge density has predominant ti-@xmath3 character .",
    "one can see different types of ordering in latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 : whereas in latio@xmath0 the orbitals arrange in a `` fish bone '' style they form a rhombus in ytio@xmath0 .",
    "these results agree with those reported in previous theoretical findings @xcite and experimental works @xcite .",
    "the presented electronic densities clarify the mechanism of the lattice distortions . because of the repulsion between negatively charged orbitals and oxygen atoms the different types of oo cause differnt types of the distortions .",
    "the orbitals in latio@xmath0 do not face toword any oxigens , thus distortions of the octahedra are small there and their rotations are dominant . on contrary in ytio@xmath0 a specific elongation of the orbitals",
    "toword o - atoms makes strong distortions of the octahedra favourable . since oo in the gga calculations is weak the corresponding forces face face opposite direction . thus taking into account the one site electronic correlations with the energy of coulomb interaction around @xmath35",
    "ev we obtain a correct type of the orbital ordering and can describe the crystal distortions .",
    "we have found the correct magnetic and electronic ground state for latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 in the framework of the gga+u calculations .",
    "the value of coulomb interaction parameter estimated from the minimum of the forces is about @xmath35  ev .",
    "this is in good agreement with the previous theoretical studies and photoemission experiments @xcite . in ytio@xmath0 in the gga+u method with the optimal @xmath1-values the band - gap is @xmath36  ev and the magnetic moment is @xmath37 in a good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the values of @xmath38 and gap @xmath39  ev for @xmath40  ev in latio@xmath0 are overestimated because of the absence of the magnetic fluctuations in gga+u @xcite .",
    "the orbital order found for all values of @xmath41 is `` fish - bone '' and rhombus - type for latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 respectively and is consistent with experimental structure findings .",
