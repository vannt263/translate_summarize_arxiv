    "it has been a long time since the existence of collisionless shocks was confirmed . in this context , the collisionless shock means discontinuities of physical quantities occurring in sufficiently rarefied plasmas , in which the effect of collisions between particles composing the plasma is negligible .",
    "so far , it is believed that collisionless shocks play important roles in a wide class of astrophysical phenomena , e.g. , supernova remnants(snrs ) , the prompt emission and afterglow of gamma - ray bursts(grb ) , jets from active galactic nuclei .    from the discovery of the bow shock in front of the terrestrial magnetosphere @xcite , the properties of collisionless shocks , e.g. , the mechanism of the formation , the shock conditions , and the configuration of the magnetic field , have been investigated by various approaches .",
    "for example , @xcite observed the formation of a collisionless shock in laboratory experiments .",
    "observationally , several satellites have revealed the nature of collisionless shocks . especially , geotail measured the variation of the magnetic field strength in the bow shock in front of the terrestrial magnetosphere from the upstream to the downstream .",
    "geotail also acquired the energy spectra of ions in the solar wind , which confirmed the existence of non - thermal particles .",
    "also in other high - energy astrophysical phenomena such as snrs and grbs , the existence of non - thermal particles is confirmed observationally . in generating such particles , a strong magnetic field amplified around the collisionless shock",
    "is considered to be a key ingredient .",
    "this prospect is supported by observations of several snrs@xcite .",
    "additionally , the recent observation of the time variation of x - ray sources in rx j1713.7 - 3946 by @xcite strongly indicates the existence of a strong magnetic field in the shock front .",
    "also in grb afterglows , the existence of a long - lived , near equipartition magnetic field is indispensable for the observed synchrotron emissions(see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretically , a great deal of investigation has been done in both analytical and numerical framework .",
    "@xcite suggested that the weibel instability@xcite , which is a kind of plasma instability caused by the anisotropic velocity distributions of collisionless plasmas , could dissipate the kinetic energy of the plasma and generate a strong magnetic field in the transition layer of a collisionless shock .",
    "first principle simulations of the formation of a collisionless shock @xcite by using recent powerful computers have supported the suggestion .",
    "especially , @xcite performed long - term 2d particle - in - cell(pic ) simulations of a relativistic collisionless shock in an unmagnetized pair plasma and found a sign of the generation of non - thermal particles via the first - order fermi acceleration mechanism@xcite .",
    "they conclude that the scattering source of particles , which is needed for the fermi acceleration to occur , is a turbulent magnetic field generated by the weibel instability in the transition layer of the shock .",
    "this is why the weibel instability is a compelling candidate for the mechanism of the formation of the shock front associated with a strong magnetic field and particle acceleration .",
    "however , there remain some problems regarding the weibel instability itself .",
    "results of recent 3d simulations of the weibel instability @xcite show that filamentary structure ( sometimes called `` current filament '' ) forms as a magnetic field is amplified .",
    "after saturation of the magnetic field strength , the filaments coalesce each other to form larger one .",
    "although each filament is small ( its initial radius is roughly equal to a few electron skin depth ) , the detailed properties of this structure , e.g. , the correlation length of the magnetic field , the particle energy distribution , and the time evolution , may affect the macroscopic behaviors of the transition layer of a collisionless shock .",
    "for example , @xcite pointed out a possibility that ultrarelativistic electrons accelerated by highly nonuniform small scale magnetic fields emit radiations different from a synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons in uniform magnetic fields .",
    "subsequently some investigations into the filamentary structure have been performed . from the conservation of energy",
    ", @xcite predicted that the magnetic field energy decreases as @xmath0 . @xcite considered a variant of landau damping ( a process dissipating the energy of electromagnetic fields into the kinetic energy of particles ) and reached a similar result for the evolution of the magnetic fields .",
    "they assumed straight orbits of particles because of weak magnetic fields , though their pic simulations reveal that there exist some regions where strong magnetic fields bend the orbits of particles .",
    "@xcite investigated the coalescence of the filaments by using a two - dimensional toy model .",
    "they pointed out that the correlation length of the magnetic field grows exponentially at first and then linearly with time .",
    "@xcite reexamine the toy model including the effect of screening currents of the background plasma and predict that the coalescence slows down when the separation of the filaments becomes larger than the skin depth of the background plasma .",
    "but their analysis does not predict whether there exists a critical scale length above which the coalescence does not proceed . furthermore , their simple model ignores micro processes such as the dissipation of the magnetic energy into the kinetic energy by the reconnection of the magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite treated the filamentary structure in the framework of the magnetohydrodynamics(mhd ) .",
    "they argue that a pressure - driven mhd instability destroys the filament and the strong magnetic field generated in the transition layer is short - lived .",
    "that is , the consensus is yet to be reached regarding the long - term evolution of the weibel filaments . especially , it is unclear whether the toy model and the mhd model are appropriate to model the filaments .",
    "to settle such unresolved problems , we use a kinetic vlasov code .",
    "this approach enables us to investigate the structure of the filaments and their coalescence and has the advantage that the accuracy of the calculated velocity distribution does not depend on the density of plasmas at each point in the physical space , while it does in pic simulations . however , there are some computational constrains on vlasov codes .",
    "the most serious one is its small dynamic range in both physical and velocity spaces . due to the defect",
    ", we can not treat the formation of a shock from two plasma flows or relativistic motions of particles .",
    "thus , in this work , we concentrate on the coalescence of filaments forming as a result of the non - relativistic weibel instability .",
    "the saturation of the relativistic weibel instability is realized by the same mechanism as that of the non - relativistic weibel instability @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we can construct a reliable model of the filaments by analyzing the non - linear behavior of the non - relativistic weibel instability in detail , it may provide a general insight into some essential processes operating in the transition layer of a collisionless shock and predict their long - term evolution beyond the reach of the simulation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the strategy for the numerical simulation .",
    "the results are shown in @xmath13 . in @xmath14",
    ", we construct an analytic model for the filaments and address remaining problems .",
    "we conclude this paper in @xmath15 .",
    "in this section , we describe the governing equations , some assumptions , and an initial setup for the numerical simulation .",
    "the equations describing the behavior of rarefied plasmas are the vlasov - maxwell system ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the vlasov equation governs the time evolution of the distribution function @xmath2 of species @xmath3(@xmath4 for ions and @xmath5 for electrons ) . here",
    "the cartesian coordinates are @xmath6 and the corresponding coordinates in the velocity space are @xmath7 .",
    "the maxwell equations govern the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we impose two assumptions .",
    "one is that the plasma is homogeneous in the @xmath10 direction , which makes the vlasov equation to take the following form ; @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the charge and the mass of species @xmath3 , and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are expressed by introducing the scalar and the vector potentials , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as @xmath17 the time evolution of the potentials is described by the wave equations ; @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electric density and the electric current density , which satisfy the lorenz condition ; @xmath21 the other assumption is that the plasma consists of ions and electrons with the same charge but with the opposite sign ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "so the source terms in equation ( [ wave ] ) are expressed in terms of @xmath23 as @xmath24      we define some values characterizing the physical quantities ; @xmath25 as the time scale , @xmath26 as the length scale , @xmath14 as the velocity , and @xmath27 as the electromagnetic field . here",
    "@xmath28 is the electron plasma frequency .",
    "normalized by these values , the governing equations described in the previous subsection can be expressed in a non - dimensional form . in the following ,",
    "we treat thus normalized physical variables .",
    "to simulate the weibel instability , we use the numerical scheme for the integration of the vlasov - maxwell system proposed by @xcite .",
    "we review their procedure that evolves the distribution functions and the electromagnetic potentials by a time interval @xmath29 in the following steps .    in integrating the vlasov equation ( [ vlasov ] ) ,",
    "we treat the electromagnetic field as static .",
    "one can see the vlasov equation ( [ vlasov ] ) consists of five one - dimensional advection equations in the form of @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an independent variable , @xmath32 is a constant and @xmath33 is a function of @xmath34 .",
    "this equation is solved by second - order van leer s scheme . here",

    "* ) numerically .",

    "we treat the above magnetic field as a perturbation to the initial distribution of particles with no electromagnetic field .",
    "next , we address the boundary conditions .",
    "the simulation domain consists of the spatial intervals given by @xmath69 $ ] and the velocity intervals given by @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is imposed in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 direction , while in the velocity space , the distribution function assumed to vanish for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the number of zones in the physical space is @xmath74 and that in the velocity space is @xmath75 .",
    "in this section , we show the results of the integration of equations ( [ vlasov])-([source ] ) under the initial condition given in the previous section .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the time evolution ( @xmath76 for the case @xmath77 ) of the electron kinetic energies in the @xmath41 and @xmath10 directions , the electric energy , and the magnetic energy .",
    "the kinetic energy of species @xmath3 in each direction is defined by @xmath78 while the electric and the magnetic energies are defined by @xmath79     ( solid ) , @xmath80 ( dashed ) , the electric energy @xmath81 ( dash - dotted ) , and the magnetic energy @xmath82 ( dotted ) , for @xmath76 and @xmath83 . ]     ( solid ) , @xmath84 ( dashed ) , the electric energy @xmath81 ( dash - dotted ) , and the magnetic energy @xmath82 ( dotted ) , for @xmath85 and @xmath83 . ]",
    "the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 evolve in the same way , because of the symmetry in the @xmath88-@xmath89 plane .",
    "the time evolution is divided into two phases , the linear phase and the saturation phase . in the linear phase ,",
    "the electric and magnetic energies increase exponentially .",
    "the growth rate is consistent with a linearized analysis @xcite .",
    "after the linear phase , non - linear effects become significant and the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the total kinetic energy of electrons , while the electric energy takes relatively small values . in the transition between the two phases , @xmath90 increases and @xmath80 decreases .",
    "this is one of the remarkable features of the weibel instability , the anisotropy of the motions is mediated by interactions between particles and electromagnetic fields .    from the time evolution of the ion kinetic energy in each direction and the electric and magnetic energies shown in figure [ figure2 ] , it is found that its large mass ( @xmath91 ) keeps the value of @xmath84 almost constant by inhibiting the efficient exchange between the kinetic energy and the electromagnetic energy .    , but for @xmath85 . ]",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the time evolution ( @xmath85 ) of @xmath90 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in the saturation phase ,",
    "the electric energy gradually decreases indicating that the difference between the density distributions of ions and electrons diminishes .",
    "however , it does not mean that the contribution of the electric force to the force balance is negligible , because the balance of the lorentz force acting on a charged particle is governed by the following relation ; @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the bulk velocity of species @xmath3 defined by @xmath94 in this simulation , a small value of the bulk velocity of ions of the order of @xmath95 enables the electric field to contribute to the achievement of the force balance .",
    "several authors @xcite have investigated the saturation mechanism of the weibel instability .",
    "their scenario is as follows .",
    "if the orbits of particles are straight , the particles can form current filaments , which generate magnetic fields around themselves .",
    "thus the magnetic field strength grows consistently as long as the orbits of particles can be regarded as straight one . on the other hand ,",
    "once the magnetic field strength becomes strong enough to deflect the orbits of particles , the particles can not form current filaments . hence",
    ", it is expected that the magnetic field strength will be saturated when the larmor radius @xmath96 of a particle becomes comparable to the characteristic scale length @xmath97 of the plasma .",
    "@xcite adopted the electron skin depth as @xmath97 , while @xcite adopted the reciprocal of the wave number of the most unstable mode of the weibel instability as @xmath97 . in @xcite ,",
    "results of a series of pic simulations imply that the radius of a filament is compatible to the characteristic scale length . in our simulation ,",
    "the wave number of the growing mode is fixed _",
    "ab initio _ from the form of the perturbation ( [ perturbation ] ) and identical to the electron skin depth @xmath26 , which leads to the formation of filaments with radius @xmath98 .",
    "then , we obtain the following condition for the saturation of the magnetic field strength ; @xmath99 we can estimate the saturated value of the magnetic field strength @xmath100 by substituting @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding magnetic field energy is @xmath102 , while @xmath103 for @xmath91 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 from the results of our simulation .",
    "therefore , this rough estimation of the saturated value of the magnetic field strength is in good agreement with the results of the simulation .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows snapshots of the electron ( or ion ) density distribution and the magnetic field configuration at @xmath106 .",
    "these trace the time evolution of the filamentary structure resulting from the development of the weibel instability . in the linear phase ,",
    "the filamentary structure develops according to the initial configuration of the magnetic field . in the beginning of the saturation phase ( @xmath107 )",
    ", we can see two filaments carrying electric currents parallel to the @xmath10-axis around @xmath108 , @xmath109 and the two other filaments carrying anti - parallel currents around @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "in this period , a quasi - equilibrium configuration seems to be achieved , since the distribution function hardly changes seems to be achieved . after a while , the configuration changes in the following way .",
    "adjacent two filaments carrying currents to the same direction begin to approach each other ( @xmath112 ) and coalesce into a large filament ( @xmath113 ) . as the snapshots at @xmath114 exhibit , the large filament oscillates after the coalescence .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation gradually decreases to achieve a new equilibrium configuration , which is self - similar to the previous one .",
    "as we see in the previous subsections , the weibel instability amplifies a transverse electromagnetic field by rapidly dissipating the bulk kinetic energy of particles .",
    "however , all the dissipated energy is not converted into the electromagnetic energy .",
    "it is known that the electromagnetic field thus amplified efficiently thermalize electrons .",
    "we can see this effect in figure [ figure5 ] , where each line represents the @xmath115-integrated velocity distribution of electrons at @xmath116 and @xmath117 . because the velocity distributions in figure [ figure5 ] are well represented by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution with zero bulk velocity ,",

    "in the first quasi - equilibrium ( @xmath121 ) , we focus on the velocity distribution at two points .",
    "they are the point at the center of a filament located at @xmath122 ( referred to as o - point ) , and the point surrounded by four filaments at @xmath123 ( referred to as x - point ) . in figure [ figure6 ] , solid and dashed lines represent the @xmath124-integrated electron velocity distributions in the period of the quasi - equilibrium at the o- and x - points , respectively . at the o - point , the velocity distribution is close to one - peak , while a symmetric two peak distribution appears at the x - point .",
    "figure [ figure7 ] shows the velocity distribution of ions with @xmath91 at the same period . on the contrary to the electrons",
    ", a two peak distribution appears even at the o - point .",
    "the distribution implies that ions have not been thermalized yet due to the large mass .",
    "figure [ figure8 ] shows the electron velocity distribution at the same period for the case of @xmath105 . because of the mass symmetry",
    ", the ion velocity distribution becomes identical with that of electrons by transforming @xmath125 as @xmath126 .",
    "the shape of the distribution in figure [ figure8 ] is similar to that in figure [ figure6 ] .     and @xmath120 . ]    .",
    "from the mass symmetry , the ion velocity distribution at any point become identical with that of electron at the same point by transforming @xmath125 as @xmath127      one can clearly see that the topology of the magnetic field changes when the filaments coalesce . in the framework of the resistive mhd , the coalescence of the self - confined plasma cylinders leads to the reconnection of the magnetic field @xcite , which is followed by the conversion of the magnetic energy into the kinetic energy of particles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , results of our simulation do not show such exchange of the energies .",
    "we have checked the velocity distribution around the x - point , where the magnetic reconnection might occur and found that it does not deviate from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "this is at variance with the prediction from the theory of the magnetic reconnection .",
    "the lack of the release of the magnetic energy seems to be attributed to the absence of the reconnection layer between the filaments , where the anti - parallel magnetic fields coexist in a narrow and compressed region , does not form between the filaments . instead , magnetic fields vanish at the middle point between the filaments .",
    "from the analysis of results of the simulation , it is found that there is a quasi - equilibrium after the formation of the filamentary structure in the saturation phase of the weibel instability . in this section",
    ", we consider whether the equilibrium is expressed by an analytical solution of the vlasov - maxwell system .      ) and ( [ potentials ] ) .",
    "the color codes and arrows represent the density distribution of electrons(or ions ) and the direction of the magnetic field in the x - y plane , respectively . ]",
    "@xcite present a method to construct stationary solutions of the vlasov - maxwell system and derive a new two - dimensional equilibrium configuration of collisionless plasmas , whose velocity distribution really resembles the quasi - equilibrium shown above . slightly modifying the result of @xcite , we construct the following equilibrium , @xmath128,\\label{electron}\\\\ f_i&=&c\\left(v_z+a_z\\right)^2\\exp\\left[-\\frac{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}{v_i^2}\\right ] , \\label{distribution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the electromagnetic potentials expressed as @xmath129 which lead to @xmath130 one can easily check that these expressions satisfy the vlasov - maxwell system exactly .    in the following",
    "we consider the case of @xmath105 because ions are not thermalized in the case of @xmath91 .",
    "if the stationary solution described above actually corresponds to the quasi - equilibrium , free parameters in the solution must be determined from results of the simulation .",
    "the value of @xmath131 is derived by fitting a gaussian to the @xmath132-integrated velocity distribution of electrons in the quasi - equilibrium phase .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath133 . the value of @xmath134 is derived from the magnetic energy @xmath82 using equations ( [ em ] ) and ( [ beq ] ) as @xmath135 on the other hand , @xmath136 from the result .",
    "so we obtain @xmath137 .",
    "-integrated electron velocity distribution of the stationary solution described by equations ( [ electron ] ) and ( [ potentials ] ) .",

    "in addition , comparing figure [ figure10 ] with figure [ figure8 ] , one can see that the dominant features appearing in figure [ figure8 ] , the one - peak distribution at the o - point and the symmetric double - peak distribution at the x - point , are well reproduced by the analytical expressions ( [ electron ] ) and ( [ potentials ] ) .    in the above discussion",
    ", we use the parameter @xmath142 and @xmath134 determined from the result of our simulation .",
    "however , the shape of the velocity distribution is sensitive to the parameters .",
    "the velocity distribution with different parameters , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , is shown in figure [ figure11 ] , which is more similar to the result of our simulation shown in figure [ figure8 ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the equilibrium configuration given by equations ( [ electron ] ) and ( [ potentials ] ) provides an appropriate expression of the quasi - equilibrium achieved in the beginning of the saturation phase , as long as the velocity distribution of electrons or that of ions with @xmath105 are concerned .",
    "although we see that there is an analytical expression to describe the quasi - equilibrium configuration , some problems remain .",
    "first problem is the disagreement of the distribution of ions with @xmath91 between the analytical expression and the result of the simulation . as in figure",
    "[ figure7 ] , the velocity distribution of ions with @xmath91 have sharp peaks compared with the electron velocity distribution , which can not be reproduced by the expressions ( [ distribution ] ) and ( [ potentials ] ) .",
    "this disagreement arises since we truncate the series of @xmath145 at the second - order ( @xmath146 ) in constructing the velocity distribution ( [ distribution ] ) .",
    "so this problem can be resolved by constructing higher - order stationary solutions of the vlasov - maxwell system according to the procedure given by @xcite ; @xmath147 \\exp\\left[-\\frac{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}{v_j^2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 are hermite polynomials .",
    "their coefficients @xmath149 are functions of @xmath150 .",
    "while this prescription enables us to make a more rigorous fits to the results of the simulation , the magnetic field can not be expressed analytically .",
    "furthermore , the expressions ( [ distribution ] ) and ( [ potentials ] ) are sufficient to reproduce the main feature of the result of the simulation , i.e. , a single peak velocity distribution at the o - point and a symmetric double peak velocity distribution at the x - point .",
    "therefore we take the construction of the higher - order stationary solutions as beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "second is on the stability of the equilibrium .",
    "results of the numerical simulation with the scale length of @xmath151 reveal that the quasi - equilibrium configuration achieved in the beginning of the saturation phase is unstable .",
    "the transition from the quasi - equilibrium to another appears in figure [ figure4 ] .",

    "it is not clear from our simulation whether the critical scale length above which the equilibrium is stable exists or not .",
    "nevertheless , we could make a brief speculation on the transition from the quasi - equilibrium state based on the result of the simulation .",
    "comparing the time evolution of the kinetic energies @xmath90 and @xmath80 shown in figure [ figure3 ] , and the time evolution of the filamentary structure shown in figure [ figure4 ] , we can see a coincidence . at the beginning of the saturation phase ( @xmath121 )",
    ", @xmath80 takes greater values than @xmath90 .",

    "@xcite treated the filamentary structure in the framework of the mhd . in our simulation , however , the velocity distribution at the x - point is far from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution as seen in figures [ figure6 ] , [ figure7 ] , and [ figure8 ] , which implies the treatment of the plasma as a magnetized fluid is not appropriate .",
    "furthermore , although they assumed that the filament is isolated and other filaments assert a negligible effect , two peaks in the velocity distribution at the x - point resultant from our simulation show that the outskirts of filaments coexist around the x - point .",

    "although this model ignores the effect of the dissipation of the magnetic field energy via reconnection of the magnetic fields , it is expected in the framework of the resistive mhd .",
    "our simulation does not show any sign of the reconnection . as stated earlier ,",
    "we attribute the lack of the magnetic reconnection to the absence of the reconnection layer between the filaments .",
    "but , this can also be due to the coarseness of the simulation . while judging whether the lack of the magnetic reconnection is real or not needs careful investigation , the results of our simulation justify the treatment of the coalescence in @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the decay of the magnetic turbulence generated by the weibel instability .",
    "this treatment is appropriate only in the region where the magnetic trapping is not so important .",
    "actually , @xcite confirm that their model can not predict the time evolution of magnetic field strength in the presence of a magnetic field with long wavelength .    while the detailed dynamical behavior of the filamentary structure is revealed in this study , some problems , for example , the long - term evolution of the filaments and whether the critical scale - length above which the equilibrium is stable exists or not , remain unclear .",
    "in addition , because the distribution function is assumed to be uniform along the direction of the initial bulk flow of plasmas , we can not deal with some 3d perturbation on the equilibrium , for example , bending and twisting of the filaments .",
    "the stability of the equilibrium described by equations ( [ electron])-([beq ] ) , which is presumably a key ingredient for a strong magnetic field to survive in long term and serve as an accelerator of particles in the transition layer of a collisionless shock front , should be investigated rigorously including 3d effects .",
    "although this study treats non - relativistic plasmas , relativistic effects become vital in some astrophysical phenomena , e.g. , grb afterglows , jets from agn .",
    "@xcite provides the relativistic extension of @xcite , i.e , stationary solutions of the relativistic vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "it is not irrelevant that one expects the equilibrium constructed by @xcite to provide an appropriate model for the filamentary structure resulting from the weibel instability in relativistic plasmas as the non - relativistic counterpart does .",

    "<S> we present results of a 2d3v kinetic vlasov simulation of the weibel instability . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic vlasov simulation allows us to investigate the velocity distribution of dilute plasmas , in which the effect of collisions between particles is negligible , and has the advantage that the accuracy of the calculated velocity distribution does not depend on the density of plasmas at each point in the physical space . </S>",
    "<S> we succeed in reproducing some features of the weibel instability shown by other simulations , for example , the exponentially growing phase , the saturation of the magnetic field strength , the formation of filamentary structure , and the coalescence of the filaments . especially , we concentrate on the behavior of the filaments after the saturation of the magnetic field strength and find that there is a kind of quasi - equilibrium states before the coalescence occurs . furthermore , it is found that an analytical solution for stationary states of the 2d3v vlasov - maxwell system can reproduce some dominant features of the quasi - equilibrium , e.g , the configuration of the magnetic field and the velocity distribution at each point . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical expression could give a plausible model for the transition layer of a collisionless shock where a strong magnetic field generated by the weibel instability provides an effective dissipation process instead of collisions between particles . </S>"
