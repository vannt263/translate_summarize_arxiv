    "it would be remarkable if the naive assumption that light linearly traces mass is correct .",
    "indeed , on scales of tens of kiloparsecs around galaxies it is known from rotation curve information that dark matter is more dispersed than starlight .",
    "it has long been entertained that dark matter might be more dispersed than light on megaparsec scales @xcite .",
    "if so , we would say there is a ` bias ' between what we see and the physically more fundamental parameter , the mass .",
    "semi - analytic models @xcite anticipate variations in the conversion of baryons into stars and the manifestation as starlight at both very low and very high densities .",
    "theoretical considerations prepare us for the possibility of a complex relationship between the distribution of mass and of the lighthouses sitting atop that mass . in this article",
    "we present observational evidence for such complexity .",
    "three environmental regimes will be considered . at home in the local group",
    "we find ourselves in an intermediate regime , common to the majority of spiral galaxies .",
    "most elliptical galaxies find themselves in a high density regime .",
    "then there is a low density regime where galaxies are few or absent .",
    "what is the relationship between light and mass in each of these three kinds of environments ?",
    "visible galaxies are embedded in halos that extend beyond the radii of observable gas and stars .",
    "we need to go to the scale of groups and clusters to obtain a measure of the total mass of galaxies .",
    "the current investigation relies on the analysis of groups by @xcite ; hereafter t87 .",
    "the individual galaxies associated with the groups in t87 are identified in table ii of @xcite .",
    "this particular group compendium has the attractive features that ( a ) it was constructed with quantitative , well defined rules , ( b ) the groups have been demonstrated to contain few interlopers , and ( c ) a subset has a high level of volume completeness .",
    "the group catalog was constructed through a tree or ` dendogram ' procedure .",
    "the construction begins by looking for the linkage between galaxies that gives the largest value of the product @xmath7 where two candidates @xmath8 and @xmath9 are considered from the ensemble of @xmath10 objects , @xmath11 is the blue luminosity of the brighter candidate , and @xmath12 is the linear separation between the two . for details on the calculation of @xmath12 from angular and radial velocity information",
    "see t87 but essentially , for linkages relevant to group scales , the @xmath12 are based on angular separations only .",
    "the dominant pair that is selected is now inserted back into the catalog as a single unit with the sum of the component luminosities and with position and velocity constructed from the luminosity weighted contributions of the components .",
    "there are now @xmath13 objects to consider and the process is repeated , over and over , until @xmath14 .    in a dendogram",
    "constructed in this manner , ultimately all galaxies under consideration are linked .",
    "obviously there is a transition at some point from collections of galaxies that are bound to those that are unbound .",
    "the issue of how to distinguish the bound and unbound domains was the subject of extensive discussion in t87 .",
    "a crossing time argument was used . at any point in the dendogram",
    ", the galaxies that are linked together can be characterized by a separation dimension , the inertial radius @xmath15 , and a velocity dispersion , @xmath16 .",
    "the crossing time @xmath17 ( see t87 for details including corrections for projection ) can be compared with the free expansion timescale , the inverse of the hubble constant , h@xmath18 .",
    "units with @xmath19 have a high probability of being bound .",
    "units with @xmath20 can be inferred to be unbound . with a judicious choice of level , the dendogram could be split between mostly bound and mostly unbound .",
    "it would follow from this choice , allowing for measurement and projection errors , that essentially all the merged units that make the dendogram cut on the high density side would have @xmath21 .",
    "an interesting aspect of this analysis is that it provides an inventory not only of all the galaxies in a volume that are in groups but also _ all that are not _ in groups . in the sample considered by t87",
    "there was the usual incompletion with distance .",
    "however a high galactic latitude volume with the distance limit of @xmath22 mpc ( @xmath23 ) has completion in the sense that all galaxies brighter than @xmath24 are included . within this volume ,",
    "t87 identified 179 groups of 2 or more galaxies and 49 groups of 5 or more . for statistical robustness",
    ", we will restrict most of the following discussion to the groups of 5 or more galaxies ( one of the small groups in t87 has been boosted to above 5 members with our current inventory , giving us 50 groups to consider ) .",
    "we should note a subtle point that arises because the dendogram linkages involve luminosities .",
    "linkages that involve bright galaxies are made more easily , as might well be reasonable if brighter galaxies are more massive .",
    "however could we miss linkages in cases where mass is underrepresented by light ?",
    "this possibility would potentially undermine the basis of this investigation .",
    "it is to be noted that t87 provides a safety net to guard against this concern .",
    "in addition to the dendogram cut that resulted in the definition of ` groups ' , a second cut was made an order of magnitude lower in luminosity density that resulted in what were called ` associations ' .",
    "we will first continue with a discussion of the groups but later we will revisit the entities called associations .",
    "the analysis in t87 missed an amazing correlation ! it is seen in figure 1 , which draws on data extracted from t87 and presented here in table 1 .",
    "the data in the left panel represent all the 50 groups in the volume with completion above @xmath24 . in the right panel",
    ", symbols distinguish between groups with majority early morphological types ( e - s0-sa : filled squares ) and groups with majority late types ( sab - irr : open circles ) .",
    "there are fewer points in this panel because , in order to make a statistically meaningful distinction in morphological class , we require there be at least 6 galaxies brighter than @xmath25 .",
    "these groups are distinguished by an entry in the third column of table 1 where the percentage type sa or earlier among galaxies brighter than @xmath25 is given .",
    "the numbers of early type groups are small in this restricted local volume , so the slightly more distant early type groups virgo  w , antlia , and ngc 5846 are also considered ( last 3 entries in table 1 ) .",
    "groups with crossing times much less than a hubble time have relatively high mass to light ( @xmath4 ) ratios , values of several hundred in solar units ( masses from t87 are unweighted virial masses following the definition given in section 6 of this paper ) .",
    "groups with crossing times that approach a hubble time have @xmath4 ratios that are much more modest , a few tens in solar units .",
    "it is also seen that there is a strong correlation between crossing time and the morphological classification .",
    "if the sample is split at a crossing time as a fraction of the hubble timescale of @xmath26 then almost all the groups with shorter crossing times are dominated by early types ( 8 of 9 ) and almost all the groups with longer crossing times are dominated by late types ( 11 of 14 ) .",
    "could the correlation seen in fig .  1 be induced by parameter coupling ?",
    "the vertical axis has dependencies on @xmath27 while the horizontal axis has dependencies @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a characteristic of the group dimension and @xmath16 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "changes in @xmath16 cause shifts in the sense of the observed correlation .",
    "changes in @xmath29 cause shifts orthogonal to the correlation .",
    "the concern would have to be with @xmath16 values but the typical measurement uncertainties in these values are 20% for the groups in question , much smaller than the factor ten range in crossing time values .",
    "most clearly , though , the correlation can not be an artifact of parameter errors and coupling between the axes because there is a strong correlation between the parameter of either axis in fig .  1 and the morphology of the galaxies .",
    "the qualitative morphological information is decoupled from the measured parameters . in the right panel of fig .  1 , the early type groups have a median crossing time about a factor 3 less and a median @xmath4 about a factor of 3 higher than the late type groups .",
    "could the correlation be an artifact caused by systematic departures from virial equilibrium ?",
    "presumably the groups with the shortest crossing times have most closely approached the virial equipartition of energy .",
    "there could be a systematic mis - estimation of mass with the virial approximation that depends on the dynamical age of a system .",
    "pacheco ( private communication ) has studied the collapse of a group with the expression : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the moment of inertia of the system , @xmath32 is the kinetic energy in the randomized motions of the constituents , @xmath33 is the kinetic energy in the ordered motions of infall , and @xmath34 is the potential energy .",
    "pacheco made analytic assumptions about what happens when , during the collapse , violent relaxation @xcite causes the transform of energy from bulk motion to a state approximated by the virial condition .",
    "dynamical friction induces the transfer of energy from ordered to random motions .",
    "the approach to equilibrium , with @xmath35 , occurs on the order of one dynamical timescale ( @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average density of the group within the virial radius ) .",
    "measurements of groups caught before relaxation would tend to result in underestimates of mass by typically 20% and a factor 2 in the extreme ( theoretically assuming full 3-d information is available ) .",
    "the situation is complex .",
    "it was suggested by @xcite that virial mass estimates might be biased low because of segregation as the visible components sink toward the center relative to dark matter .",
    "this possible systematic would increase as the group ages , consequently it would run counter to the correlation seen in fig .  1 .",
    "there is room for further analysis of the properties of groups extracted from cosmological simulations .",
    "high resolution is required to avoid the concern of artificial 2-body relaxation from massive numerical particles .",
    "there is firmer ground on the observational side .",
    "there is general agreement that groups and clusters with high densities and short dynamical times have @xmath4 values of several hundred .",
    "these circumstances are confirmed by x - ray and gravitational lensing studies .",
    "we suggest that the trend to substantially lower @xmath4 values for systems with longer dynamical times seen in fig .",
    "1 is consistent with what is now known from the few detailed studies of low density groups .",
    "the situation is clearest in the local group and has received confirmation from recent studies of the nearest neighboring groups .",
    "these groups are represented in the left panel of fig .  1 but are not sufficiently populated to enter the right panel .",
    "they lie in the lower right corner , with large crossing times and low @xmath4 .",
    "the local group encompasses two dynamical regimes . on a 100  kpc scale ,",
    "each of the two major galaxies host a school of minor systems that approximate virial conditions . on a 1  mpc scale",
    ", the two major galaxies and ten or so other small galaxies are falling together , most on first approach .",
    "this latter assertion is based on the observation that almost all the local group systems that are not tightly associated with either of the two major galaxies have negative velocities in the local group standard of rest ( ngc 6822 is an exception ) .",
    "the masses of the milky way and andromeda sub - groups can be estimated through the virial theorem since these sub - systems have densities and crossing times that suggest they are dynamically evolved @xcite .",
    "the stellar stream on a scale of 125 kpc around m31 provides a compatible mass estimate @xcite .",
    "each sub - group is determined to have @xmath38 .",
    "the mass of the larger infall region can be estimated separately .",
    "one approach follows the @xcite timing argument .",
    "a variation on this approach is provided by the identification of the current turnaround radius or zero - velocity surface for the local group @xcite .",
    "there is the important result that the sum of the masses of the andromeda and milky way sub - systems add to approximately the mass determined to lie within the zero - velocity surface of @xmath39 .",
    "a similar mass is found from orbit reconstructions @xcite .",
    "our naive virial estimation ( table 1 : group 14 - 12 ) gives a local group mass of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in factor 2 agreement with other results .",
    "recent observations of the resolved stars in nearby galaxies with hubble space telescope have dramatically improved our knowledge of distances to many nearby galaxies and hence of the structure of the nearest groups .",
    "we now know that the best studied neighboring groups , those about m81 ( table 1 : group 14 - 10 ) and centaurus  a ( table 1 : group 14 - 15 ) , have dumbbell structures like the local group . in both cases",
    "the two largest galaxies are surrounded by swarms of small galaxies which transit their hosts in times much less than the age of the universe . almost certainly in the case of the m81 group and plausibly in the case of the centaurus group",
    ", the substructures are falling together . as with the local group , the masses inferred for the entire bound entities ( 2 and 3 times @xmath2 respectively ) are close to the sum of the masses of the dynamically evolved subcomponents @xcite .",
    "the halos of the giant galaxies must not extend much beyond the domain of the immediate companions and the group @xmath4 values are a few tens .",
    "these groups that are overall spiral rich and low density evidently have @xmath4 values well below 100 .",
    "the virial approximation for these groups , while crude , gives mass estimates that are not strongly deviant .",
    "while theoretical expectations might cause one to anticipate systematic underestimations of mass assuming the virial approximation , studies of the nearest structures reveal that a crude application of the virial theorem may frequently result in _ overestimations _ of mass .",
    "frequently , unbound objects will be erroneously included as group members .",
    "the availability of good distances to individual galaxies shows that the very nearby sculptor group ( table 1 : 14 - 13 ) and cvn i group ( table 1 : 14 - 07 ) are composites of regions that are unlikely to be bound in the ensemble . the inclusion of expansion velocities and the inflation of group scale cause overestimates of mass .",
    "these effects are pernicious for the extended , low dispersion systems that inhabit the lower right corner of fig .  1 .",
    "the limited information available on morphological variations from studies of nearby groups is giving a hint of higher mass in early type systems .",
    "the kinematics of the sub - group around centaurus  a suggest a mass of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( albeit including the large spiral ngc 4945 ) while the m83 sub - group is found to have a mass of @xmath40 and @xmath44 .",
    "the elliptical cen  a may have a higher @xmath4 by a factor 23 relative to the large spirals in our vicinity .",
    "the situation in the nearest groups is reviewed by @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the correlation between mass and light for the tf87 sample of nearby groups . in the left panel ,",
    "all the 50 groups in the volume - limited sample with at least 5 members are represented .",
    "the groups with @xmath45 are plotted with filled squares and the groups with larger crossing times are plotted with open circles .",
    "the 3 more distant early type groups , all with @xmath45 , are plotted as inverted triangles .",
    "the solid line at @xmath46 indicates the mean @xmath4 value determined by t87 for this sample .",
    "again we see that the groups with short crossing times have less blue luminosity per unit of mass .",
    "in addition , it can be said that groups with more mass manifest less blue light per unit mass .",
    "we consider the same data in the right panel but now the differentiation is made on the basis of the morphology of the groups .",
    "it is seen again that the qualitative morphological description and the quantitative crossing time measure provide an equivalent basis for distinguishing between high and low @xmath4 systems .        the virgo cluster ( group 11 - 1 in tf87 ) and three other specific groups are identified in the left panel of fig .",
    "it is instructive to consider the pairwise properties of these groups .",
    "it can be seen that the ngc 1407 ( 51 - 8 ) group has roughly the same mass as the ursa major cluster ( group 12 - 1 ) but much lower luminosity .",
    "the ngc  1407 group has the same luminosity as the ngc 1023 ( 17 - 1 ) group but much more mass . these similarities and differences",
    "are not in observational doubt .",
    "there is a summary of the properties of these groups in table 1 of @xcite ; see also fig .  1 in that reference for histograms of the group velocities .",
    "the unusual nature of the ngc 1407 group has been noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the group contains only two @xmath47 galaxies but has a velocity dispersion of 385 km  s@xmath48 .",
    "the ursa major cluster , by contrast , has almost enough luminous galaxies to qualify as an abell richness class 0 cluster ! the velocity dispersion , though , is only 148 km  s@xmath48 .",
    "the virial masses of the two groups are almost the same . in the ngc",
    "1407 group motions are large in a small volume while in the ursa major cluster motions are low in a large volume . yet",
    "the luminosities differ by a factor 5 and @xmath4 values differ accordingly .",
    "the ngc  1023 group is a scaled down version of the ursa major cluster .",
    "there are three @xmath47 galaxies and the group velocity dispersion is only 57 km  s@xmath48 .",
    "the ngc  1023 and ngc  1407 groups have similar galaxy content in terms of numbers and luminosity ( the type content is late and early , respectively ) .",
    "however the motions in the ngc  1407 group are a factor of 7 higher .",
    "this difference can not be questioned observationally , and the implied mass of the ngc  1407 group is higher by a factor 30 .    in summary of this section ,",
    "evidence is provided of an order of magnitude variation of @xmath4 that depends on mass and/or stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "the derivation of mass from the virial theorem might have biases but there are effects that both raise and lower estimates .",
    "the cases that are particularly well studied provide confirmation of the trends shown in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "there is a strong inference from numerical action orbit reconstructions that the virgo cluster is very underluminous for its mass compared with the general field . from a first analysis of the local supercluster @xcite with 300 distance estimates as constraints and a later analysis @xcite with 900 distance estimates , it was determined that the mean density of the universe is @xmath49 , consistent with an overall mean @xmath50 assignment . however , as emphasized in the latter paper , it is not possible with a _",
    "single _ assignment of @xmath4 for all galaxies to obtain a satisfactory model that simultaneously gives a good description of flows in the general vicinity of the local supercluster and a good description of the infall region around the virgo cluster .",
    "evidence for this claim is provided in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the first of these figures show velocity - distance data for galaxies in a group along a specific line - of - sight with respect to the virgo cluster .",
    "the two panels illustrate attempts to fit this data with two distinct numerical action models .",
    "the solid curves represent the run of velocity with distance expected by the separate models . in the left panel , a value @xmath51",
    "is assigned to all groups and galaxies .",
    "the location of the galaxy data points in velocity and distance can not be understood in the context of the model in this panel . in the right panel , @xmath52 is assigned to the virgo cluster , and incidentally to all e / s0 knots . in compensation for this increase in the mass of some of the objects , @xmath53 is given all the rest .",
    "now the infall motions toward virgo are greatly enhanced and the model gives a physical basis for the location of this particular group in velocity - distance space .",
    "we see that the group must be slightly nearer than the cluster and falling away from us into the cluster .",
    "the swing in amplitude of the wave in velocity - distance seen in fig .",
    "3 ( the ` triple - value ' characteristic @xcite ) depends on the mass assigned to the cluster .",
    "it can be seen that the curve in the right panel of fig .  3 only minimally reaches the location of the data points , hence represents a _ minimum _ required mass .",
    "a larger mass would cause a larger swing and would not be in conflict with the data but is not required .",
    "4 shows the constraints provided by many lines - of - sight through the virgo infall region . the individual points record velocity and angular distance from virgo , as open circles for galaxies in the cluster proper ( defined by the ` caustic ' radius established by galaxies that have fallen into the cluster and back out to a second turnaround ) , and as filled circles for galaxies identified to be within the first infall region . to keep the plot clean ,",
    "galaxies at foreground and background ` triple - value ' locations have been rejected based on distance information .",
    "the swings in amplitude of the triple - value waves along various lines - of - sight are indicated by the brackets in the two panels .",
    "it is clear that the swing generated by the numerical action model of the left panel , with @xmath51 for all points , fails by a wide margin to explain the infall motions into the virgo cluster .",
    "the model used in the right panel , with @xmath52 given to the virgo cluster and @xmath53 assigned to the field , provides a satisfactory description to the observed data .",
    "_ almost a factor 7 higher @xmath4 value is required for the virgo cluster than for the general field . _",
    "the evidence for a lot of mass in the cluster which comes from the extended nature of the infall region ( extending to @xmath54 from the center of the cluster or 8 mpc ) and high infall velocities ( galaxies hit the caustic surface of the cluster at @xmath55 with a velocity of 1500 km  s@xmath48 ) requires a remarkable @xmath56 within the 2 mpc caustic surface of second turnaround .",
    "this mass is almost twice the virial mass estimate but it pertains to a radius three times larger than the virial radius .",
    "the infall mass estimate pertains to the cluster on it s largest scale .",
    "it can be noted that a similar conclusion was reached much earlier @xcite with a non - linear but spherically symmetric analytic model of virgo cluster infall .",
    "the very same conclusions were reached that there had to be a lot of mass for the amount of light in the cluster but much less mass with respect to light in the supercluster environs surrounding the cluster .",
    "the preferred model in the @xcite analysis used two discrete @xmath4 assignments : @xmath52 was assigned to 12 e - s0 dominated groups including the virgo cluster and @xmath53 was assigned otherwise .",
    "( the action models do not provide constraints on the masses of the e - s0 groups smaller than virgo because the triple value regions are too restricted to map infall .",
    "the large @xmath4 assignments for these groups were based on the virial information discussed earlier . )",
    "it was concluded that @xmath49 associated with galaxies in the mean but that the virgo cluster in particular must have a much higher @xmath4 value than the mean . the numerical action mean result for the field ( @xmath53 ) and the large mass for virgo ( @xmath57 )",
    "are recorded in the right panel of fig .  2 .",
    "as an aside , it should be noted that what is meant by the terms ` group ' and ` cluster ' are not well defined , other than that there is the inference that the structures are bound . in the case of the local group , it was discussed that there is a zero - velocity surface at @xmath58  mpc radius @xcite .",
    "this surface defines a bound domain and provides a logical limit to the group .",
    "however , the local group is certainly not virialized over this domain . at most ,",
    "there may be limited quasi - virialized regimes within @xmath59  kpc about each of the two dominant galaxies . by contrast",
    ", when we talk about the virgo cluster we certainly do not consider it to extend to the current zero - velocity surface which lies on the near side at about half the distance from us to the cluster core .",
    "rather , a good working definition of the volume of the cluster is the domain within the first caustic , the outer limit of objects that have completed a single passage .",
    "the cluster is not virialized to this radius but the approach toward virialization will be greater within a cluster defined this way than in the local group analog .",
    "the discussion to this point , involving the properties of groups and the inferences drawn from modeling of flow patterns in the local supercluster , has dealt with comparisons between intermediate and high density regimes .",
    "attention will now turn to lower density environments .",
    "the algorithm for the selection of groups used by t87 contained luminosity .",
    "could we loose real groups because their constituents are underluminous ?",
    "we have just been arguing that groups with short crossing times and dominated by early type galaxies are environments that are underluminous compared with the environments of groups with crossing times approaching a hubble time and dominated by spirals and irregulars .",
    "fortunately , no groups of the former type would have been missed in the construction of the group catalog because the e / s0 groups with short crossing times have considerably higher spatial densities than the spiral groups .",
    "consequently they comfortably cross the luminosity density threshold set for the group catalog even though they turn out to be underluminous . in the years that have passed since",
    "the catalog was developed we have never become aware of a high spatial density but low luminosity group in the volume of our sample that escaped identification .",
    "however we can not be so sanguine in the limit of low spatial densities .",
    "indeed , among the entities called ` associations ' that came out of the t87 study there were some that look suspiciously like the entities identified as groups .",
    "the dimensions of these units are only several hundred kiloparsecs , like the groups .",
    "they can have _ very low _ velocity dispersions , comparable with the lowest values in the established groups . _ their members are all dwarfs .",
    "_ they were not picked up in the groups analysis because they have very low luminosities .",
    "if they are bound groups then the associated @xmath4 is much larger than is familiar to us from our experience with the intermediate regime spiral groups .",
    "our interest in these entities was rekindled by work from a very different direction .",
    "we were interested in possible environmental dependencies at the faint end of the luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "it seems that there are unexpectedly few dwarf galaxies compared with the expectations of the standard hierarchical model for galaxy formation @xcite@xcite .",
    "we suggested that the deficiency with respect to the standard model might be greater at lower densities @xcite , hereafter tstv .",
    "there might be an expectation that there are many low mass dark matter halos floating about with little or no gas and stars .",
    "we speculated that there might be a possibility to identify the dynamical manifestations of such halos in a certain special environment .",
    "these low mass dark halos would not be of sufficient consequence to be noticed in our standard groups , even those as modest as the local group . at a mass and density regime well below that of the local group , according to the hypothesis that we are pursuing that low mass halos are voided of gas and stars , then there would be nothing to be seen .",
    "however , in the interval _ between _ the normal groups and putative much smaller structures it might be expected that _ there are groups that are mostly , but not entirely dark . _    as discussed in tstv , it occurred to us that the ` mostly dark ' groups that could be anticipated from theoretical grounds might be found among the subset of associations in the t87 study with group - like dimensions and low velocity dispersions but high implied @xmath4 values .",
    "we drew attention to four such groups thought to lie within 5 mpc .",
    "the key issue regarding these ` groups of dwarfs ' that we identify is whether they are bound . _",
    "if they are bound then they must have high @xmath4 values .",
    "_ in order to illuminate this issue , we have been involved in programs to identify other potential group members and to get good distances to individual objects .",
    "these galaxies are all near enough that they are easily resolved with hubble space telescope ( hst ) and distances can be established from the luminosities of stars at the tip of the red giant branch @xcite , the ` trgb ' distance method .",
    "we first review the present status of these programs .",
    "at the time of the paper by tstv , good distances were only known for members of one of the four putative groups of dwarfs .",
    "now there are reasonable distances from the trgb method based on hst images for _ most of the galaxies in all of the groups_. the new distances are reported in the following publications : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the updated results are summarized in table  2 for the four candidate groups of dwarfs and one additional comparison group .",
    "no weighting is applied in the calculation of the dimension , velocity , and mass parameters since it is assumed that the individual galaxies are inconsequential test particles in the potential of the group .",

    "however the use of the two mass estimators provides a better feel for the considerable uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath4 values determined by tstv are carried for convenience into table 2 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath4 values have increased slightly overall with the current analysis .",
    "a principal cause of this small increase was a mistake in corrections to luminosities of galaxies in tstv .",
    "in that paper the luminosities had corrections for obscuration based on the prescription by @xcite . however , the obscuration in dwarf galaxies is sufficiently low as to be unmeasurable @xcite . in this paper ,",

    "we entertained that gr8 = ddo 155 might be a member but this galaxy is significantly farther away than was assumed by tstv , at 2.24 mpc rather than 1.51 mpc @xcite .",
    "this galaxy is also , by a substantial amount , the farthest removed from the other group candidates on the plane of the sky .",
    "consequently , we eliminate this object from consideration as a group member .",
    "moreover the object lsbc d634 - 03 is now revealed to be a background galaxy coincident with an hi high velocity cloud .",
    "the other 4 candidates are still considered at the distances given in tstv . in the case of this group ,",
    "the virial mass estimator is particularly untrustworthy because two of the candidates are very close neighbors ; ngc 3109 and antlia are separated by 29 kpc . since @xmath75 , the single pair dominates by an order of magnitude over the next pair in the calculation of the scale of the potential well .",
    "if the separation of this pair is arbitrarily set to 100 kpc , still smaller than any other separation in the group , then the virial mass estimate doubles .",
    "there is a chronic ambiguity in the virial mass estimator with small numbers and instances of close pairs .",
    "however , only this one group suffers this problem among the cases we are considering .",
    "overall , the viability of the 14 + 12 candidate group remains as it was with the discussion by tstv , with an implied @xmath76 if the entity is bound .    _",
    "14 + 8 = ugc 8760 group : _ distance measurements have revealed that this group is much closer than the @xmath77  mpc that we expected .",
    "there are now trgb distances for all the candidates , including a new and provisionary one for ugc 8760 itself .",
    "being closer , the linear separations are smaller than we appreciated .",
    "also we have become aware of a fourth system , ugc 9240 , which also is probably associated .",
    "the three well measured distances are very similar ( ugc 8651 at 3.01 mpc ; ugc 8833 at 3.19 mpc ; ugc 9240 at 2.79 mpc ) .",
    "the first two were associated with the group by tstv and it is a powerful claim for the reality of the group that they both have unexpectedly low and similar distances .",
    "a nice test for the hypothesis being pursued is that the distance of ugc 8760 be also low and an hst observation returned as this paper goes to press reveals ugc  8760 to be at @xmath78  mpc .",
    "it is seen in table  2 that the new @xmath4 values are consistent between methods and considerably larger than found previously .",
    "the difference from the tstv results is most marked in this case .",
    "part of this increase is a direct consequence of the downward revision in distance ; @xmath4 is inversely dependent on distance .",
    "the other causes are the addition of the fourth candidate member and the changes to luminosities discussed above .",
    "a value @xmath79 is required if the entity is bound .    _",

    "the factor 3 larger @xmath4 than previously is attributable to the correction to luminosities and the distance differentials that reveal this group is extended more in the line - of - sight than in projection . if the group is bound then @xmath79 .    _",
    "14 + 13 = foreground sculptor group , a comparison case : _ this structure was included in the discussion by tstv . in the past ,",
    "several of the galaxies have been considered as part of the sculptor group but we consider this historical group to consist of two distinct entities . we give attention to the nearer part .",
    "one good new candidate is added to the group specified by tstv : eso 294 - 010 .",
    "all but the group s most luminous galaxy , ngc 55 , have measured distances now ( eso 294 - 010 at 1.92  mpc ; ngc 300 at 2.00  mpc ; ugca  438 at 2.23  mpc ; ic  5152 at 2.07  mpc ) .",
    "results are little different than previously .",
    "the mass estimates are as low as for any of the groups discussed above because of the very low velocity dispersion .",
    "however there are two moderate galaxies in the group so there is substantial luminosity . ic  5152",
    "is removed by 770  kpc from the group centroid , mostly in projection , so the status of this object is in doubt . whether or not it is included , if the entity is assumed to be bound then @xmath81 .",
    "the candidate groups have mass estimates in the modest range @xmath82 .",
    "characteristic dimensions range 290  kpc  @xmath83 540  kpc with a mean of 420  kpc , typical of more familiar groups ( t87 ) .",
    "velocity dispersions range from 36  km  s@xmath48 down to an incredibly low 13  km  s@xmath48 with a mean of 22  km  s@xmath48 .",
    "these values are all very low compared to familiar luminous groups and account for the low mass estimates .",
    "luminosities are all in the decade @xmath84 except for the comparison case of the 14 + 13 or foreground sculptor group which has almost an order of magnitude more luminosity than the most luminous of the others .",
    "crossing times as a fraction of the hubble time are given in the last column of table  2 .",
    "typically values are @xmath85 . of course",
    ", the crossing times are long because the velocity dispersions are so low .",
    "they are a sufficiently large fraction of the age of the universe that one can worry that velocities are simply attributable to the expansion of the universe ; ie , that these are not bound groups . only in the case of the tight 17 + 6 ( ngc 784 )",
    "group is the crossing time substantially less than a hubble time , h@xmath86 .",
    "if ic  5152 is accepted as part of the 14 + 13 ( foreground sculptor ) group then the crossing time for this group is 50% longer than h@xmath86 , but this is the comparison case : a group with low @xmath4 .    to this point there has been almost no discussion of uncertainties .",
    "first , it is to be emphasized that the measurement errors in the observed parameters are of almost no consequence .",
    "the radial velocities are obtained by observations of the 21 cm line of hi and for these dwarfs are determined with an accuracy of @xmath87  km  s@xmath48 .",
    "the distances are determined with the trgb method .",
    "there might be a distance scale zero point issue at the level of 10% that would shift the entire sample in a similar fashion and not affect this discussion .",
    "relatively , the distances should be accurate to 5% for galaxies within 3 mpc .",
    "there is a degradation to @xmath88 at 5 mpc .",
    "however in none of the groups discussed here is the depth of the group dominant over the projected dimensions .",
    "hence errors in measured dimensions do not make a significant contribution to uncertainties .",
    "the most poorly known direct observables are the luminosities .",
    "the global group luminosities attributable to the identified candidates can have errors as large as 30% .",
    "the luminosities come from heterogeneous sources , some with large errors .",
    "the situation could be improved with dedicated observations .",
    "still , the real uncertainties lie elsewhere .",
    "the greatest uncertainty of all is whether or not the groups are bound .",
    "assuming for the moment that they are , then there are four dominant uncertainties in the calculation of a group mass : ( a ) small number statistics , ( b ) the statistics of velocity deprojection from one to three dimensions , ( c ) potentially poor coverage of the group gravitational well , and ( d ) the nature of the galaxy orbits .",
    "the first two of these problems lead to uncertainties that are statistical in nature .",
    "the groups under consideration have 4 or 5 candidate members each .",
    "the number of pairs grows as @xmath89 so each additional candidate gives a big improvement . as for the velocity deprojection problem , recall that mass calculation involves @xmath90 and the deprojection correction is a factor 3 .",
    "the latter two problems raise possibilities of systematic errors in the mass calculations . with regard to the question of coverage of the group potential well ,",
    "one aspect is simply the limited coverage with only 4 or 5 test particles and another aspect is the uncertainty in the limits of the putative bounded regions .",
    "do the candidates at larger radii represent those limits , or are they frequently beyond those limits and escaping ? finally , there is the nature of the galaxy orbits .",
    "are they isotropized to a degree as would occur as a system approaches virialization or are they largely radial as would be expected of a group still in formation , with orbits dominated by infall ?",
    "the alternatives have different implications for the projected velocities . following the assumption of the virial theorem : @xmath91 , where the kinetic energy per unit mass is @xmath92 and",
    "the potential energy per unit mass is @xmath93 ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the possibility of systematic departures from the virial condition was discussed in section 3 . both from analytic and n - body simulations @xcite it is found that mean values of @xmath94 evolve from small values at turnaround to @xmath58 at first collapse , to ratios up to 20% above unity , whence there is a slow approach to virialization from values above 1 .",
    "there can be large excursions in individual cases .",
    "the results of this paper could require modification due to this probable systematic effect .",
    "dense groups that are well advanced toward virialization will tend to have @xmath94 greater than unity by @xmath95 so mass estimates will be above true values while groups that are still collapsing will tend to have @xmath94 less than unity by up to a factor 2 so mass estimates will be below true values .",
    "given the other large sources of errors , the uncertainty regarding the dynamical state is not dominant so the virial condition will be assumed .",
    "mass estimates have been calculated two ways , following the discussion by @xcite . except in the special case of the 14 + 12 ( ngc 3109 ) group that received discussion ,",
    "the two mass estimates for a group differ from the mean by no more than 35% . if it is simply assumed that the group is bound then one gets a _ lower mass limit _ which is one - half the virial estimate . in the plots that will be shown further along , factor 3 uncertainties in mass",
    "have been assumed for groups with 4 candidates .",
    "even the very large uncertainties that have been discussed do not bring into question the fundamental claim being made pertaining to the low density regime .",
    "_ if the candidate dwarf groups are bound then high @xmath4 values are required for the groups .",
    "_ we can think of two arguments that favor the point of view that the groups are bound .",
    "the first notes the continuity in properties with well established groups in terms of dimensions and velocity dispersions .",
    "these properties are illustrated in figure  5 . to a reasonable degree , the e / s0 dominated groups and spiral dominated groups separate on this plot .",
    "the early - type groups tend to be restricted spatially but can manifest large velocity dispersions while the late - type groups inevitably have modest velocity dispersions but can be dispersed spatially ( there are a few groups with majority early types with the properties of the spiral groups ) .",
    "the candidate dwarf groups can be viewed as an extension of the distribution of the groups dominated by spirals .",
    "there is nothing to suggest from these parameters that characterize the dynamical state that the dwarf groups are other than a continuation of the family of bound groups to lower masses .",
    "it is only when attention is given to the luminosities of the systems that one appreciates that the situation is quite different from the familiar .",
    "the second argument draws on the highly correlated nature of the distribution of dwarf galaxies . within 5 mpc , most known dwarfs are members of the few well established groups ( 14 - 7 : cvn  i group ; 14 - 10 : m81 group ;",
    "14 - 11 : maffei / ic  342 group ; 14 - 12 : local group ; 14 - 13 : sculptor group ; 14 - 15 : centaurus group ) and most of the rest are associated with a few relatively isolated bright galaxies or are members of the dwarf groups that have been identified .",
    "the current census of the sky for dwarf galaxies is mainly due to the hard work extracting candidates from the second palomar observatory sky survey in the northern sky and the eso / serc survey of the southern sky by karachentseva and collaborators @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , with hi follow up reported in @xcite and earlier papers .",
    "the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) is providing an independent search of the southern part of the sky @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide a tabulation of 156 galaxies , big and small , identified to exist between 1 and 5.5 mpc of us ( hence excludes the local group ) .",
    "fully 101 of the objects are associated with the well established groups identified in the previous paragraph .",
    "another 13 are associated with relatively isolated luminous galaxies and 6 are associated with somewhat more distant groups or are at very low galactic latitude .",
    "then there are the 21 galaxies we associate with the groups of dwarfs or the comparison 14 + 13 ( ngc 55 ) group . that leaves only 15 low luminosity galaxies remaining through the rest of the volume .",
    "several of these are in close proximity to one another .",
    "the strong correlation in position of the nearby galaxies is illustrated in figure  6 .",
    "the top panel shows the two - point correlation function for all known galaxies at @xmath96 within 5 mpc , excluding the local group within 1.1 mpc .",
    "good distances exist for a majority of these galaxies , and rough distances exist for the rest , so what is shown here is the three - dimensional two - point function .",
    "normalization was achieved by comparison with 1000 monte carlo random distributions within the volume .",
    "the strong positive correlation at separations less than 1 mpc is dominated by the contributions from the well known nearby galaxy groups .",
    "the bottom panel in fig . 6 examines the two - point correlation when contributions from the dominant groups have been excised . in this case ,",
    "spheres of radius 1.4 mpc have been defined centered on the 5 dominant nearby high latitude groups : those associated with m81 , cvn  i , centaurus , sculptor , and ngc 1313 ( the maffei group lies at low latitude as does a majority of the centaurus group ) .",
    "the 80% of the volume that remains ( 220 mpc@xmath97 ) contains 30% of the original sample ( 42 galaxies ) .",
    "the foreground sculpter and three of four of our candidate dwarf groups are in the remaining volume , contributing 17 of the 42 galaxies ( the 14 + 19 group lies at low galactic latitude ; in fact the fussy @xmath96 limit was chosen to allow inclusion of the entire 17 + 6 group ) .",
    "it is seen that even when the historically known groups are eliminated there is still a strong correlation signal at separations less than 1 mpc . the signal at separations less than 0.5 mpc is 63% of the signal in the top panel .",
    "this signal is dominated by the correlations within the four low mass candidate groups .",
    "the positive correlation signal at separations greater than 9 mpc has an easy explanation .",
    "the monte carlo normalization assumes objects are distributed randomly throughout the available volume but in fact most nearby galaxies lie in the supergalactic equatorial plane .",
    "the signal at large separations comes from cross - correlations from opposite ends of the equatorial plane , between the 17 + 6 members and galaxies in the region of the centaurus group on the one hand and between galaxies in the vicinity of the sculptor group with those near cvn  i and near centaurus . in this small sample ,",
    "only 3 - 4 galaxies in each of these regions is enough to create the spurious cross - correlation signal .",
    "the weaker signal at large separations in the top panel arises from the same source : the concentration of local galaxies to a plane .",
    "the present analysis is preliminary because the census of dwarfs is still uncertain .",
    "it is still not clear that even the high latitude sky has been uniformly surveyed .",
    "it is not clear how rapidly candidates are lost with galactic latitude .",
    "hi signals for objects with velocities near zero can be lost in the confusion of galactic emission .",
    "our knowledge of the distances of candidates is improving rapidly with hst imaging but is still very incomplete .",
    "on the basis of present information the dwarf groups that have been identified are manifest enhancements over a random distribution .",
    "they correlate comparably well as the galaxies in previously established groups .",
    "the small dimensions of the dwarf groups and the highly significant 2-point correlation signal on scales @xmath98 mpc suggest that the groups of dwarfs are bound . given that proposition , we can add the information from the low density regime to the data from the intermediate and high density regime shown in fig .",
    "the combined data is seen in figure 7 .",
    "t87 groups of 2 - 4 members are added to provide information about the situation at low luminosities , though mass estimates are very uncertain for these entities .",
    "the four groups of dwarfs are plotted with error bars in mass .",
    "they lie at luminosities below @xmath99 and well below the dotted @xmath4 constant line .",
    "the comparison 14 + 13 ( ngc 55 ) group lies in the same mass range but at higher luminosity , well above the dotted line .",
    "the solid curve was fit to the ensemble of data .",
    "the curve corresponds to the expression : @xmath100 this equation relates luminosity and mass with 3 constraints : a logarithmic slope at the high mass end , @xmath101 , a low mass exponential cutoff set by @xmath102 , and a normalization , @xmath103 .",
    "the curve was fit by minimizing a @xmath104 with uncertainties taken in mass only : @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is the mass in the relationship described by eq .",
    "( 2 ) at the luminosity @xmath107 of group @xmath8 , with measured mass @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath104 normalization is given the dependence on the number of group members @xmath10 according to the formulation @xmath109 .",
    "a weighting that favors groups with large @xmath10 more than the statistical @xmath110 is justified by the expected better approximation to a virialized state for the larger groups and to compensate for the small numbers of large @xmath10 systems .",
    "the absolute normalization of the @xmath104 evaluator is arbitrary : we simply search for the lowest value .",
    "we set @xmath111 for the traditional groups and @xmath112 for the groups of dwarfs ; ie , give double weight to the groups of dwarfs because they are drawn from a restricted region and are few in number .        the curve superimposed on the data in fig .",
    "7 has a slope at the high mass end of @xmath113 .",
    "it can be appreciated that taking errors only in mass leads to a steeper slope than if errors are distributed into luminosity . at the low mass end",
    "the curve demonstrates an exponential cutoff characterized by @xmath114 .",
    "the normal luminous groups with 5 or more members only provide information at masses @xmath115 .",
    "groups of 24 members provide information at lower luminosities and masses but at the cost of large uncertainties in mass .",
    "the evidence for the cutoff comes from the four candidate dwarf groups . in the absence of the dwarf groups",
    "we might be left to suppose that there is simply a lower limit to the mass range of groups . however , from fig .",
    "7 we instead infer that smaller mass groups do exist but groups are not manifested by the light of stars at very low masses .",
    "the break is more dramatically represented in figure 8 .",
    "this plot shows the same data but the vertical axis gives the departure from a @xmath46 line in the previous plot .",
    "large errors in masses in small groups create diagonal scatter in this plot .",
    "the inference we draw from the foreground sculptor group , with very low @xmath116 , is that there is tremendous real scatter in the baryon content of halos in the proximity of the mass cutoff .",
    "interestingly , both @xcite and @xcite have deduced a similar dependence between mass and light from observations of the luminosity function of galaxies derived from redshift surveys and the assumption that the underlying halo mass function follows the modified press - schechter description of @xcite .",
    "the deduction follows from the observation that , compared with the mass function , the luminosity function is shallower at the faint end and cuts off more abruptly at the bright end , implying @xmath117 increases at the two extremes relative to the intermediate range .        to conclude",
    ", we take a look at the mass function in the volume with @xmath118 and a distance limit of @xmath22  mpc ( distances from a numerical action velocity field model ) and the fraction of the total mass lying in specific environments .",
    "this information is summarized in figure 9 .",
    "the mass function incorporates all the groups involved in the earlier discussion , plus contributions from galaxies that lie outside any of these groups .",
    "we have no information on the extended mass around individual galaxies but for the purpose of constructing this mass function it is assumed that @xmath119 .",
    "the contribution of the individual galaxies by number is given by the figures in brackets in fig .",
    "it is seen that the individual galaxies only become dominant in their contribution below @xmath2 and with our @xmath4 assumption for the individual galaxies their contribution to the overall mass budget is small .    the mass function shown in fig .",
    "9 becomes incomplete below @xmath2 .",
    "the error bars only reflect the statistical uncertainty associated with the observed contributions . to get an estimate of the contribution to the total mass budget of low mass groups we consider the restricted volume within 5  mpc . in this volume",
    "there are 5 groups of luminous galaxies , excluding the low latitude 14 - 11 ( maffei / ic  342 ) group , and these groups cumulatively contain about @xmath120 .",
    "three high latitude luminous galaxies unassociated with significant groups ( ngc 1313 , ngc 3621 , and ngc 6503 ) , if assumed to have an associated @xmath121 , would contain about @xmath122 in their vicinity .",
    "the five low mass groups discussed here would cumulatively contain about @xmath123 .",
    "roughly @xmath124 of the mass related to observable galaxies within 5 mpc would lie in the major groups , almost 90% would be associated in some way with luminous galaxies , and only about 12% would be in the regions of the groups of dwarfs . although the number of groups associated with low mass halos are comparable to the number of familiar groups in the local region , they contribute only a small fraction of the mass .",
    "hence the inventory of the mass of the universe tied up in bound structures represented by fig .",
    "9 is unlikely to be seriously in error at the low mass end .",
    "the histogram of mass fractions by mass interval seen in fig .",
    "9 can be summarized as follows .",
    "fully 40% of the mass in this local volume is in the single object , the virgo cluster ( clearly , the high mass end of the mass function is poorly determined in such a restricted volume ) .",
    "the groups that have short crossing times and are dominated by e / s0/sa galaxies ( including virgo ) contain 60% of the mass .",
    "looking at groups of all types , 90% of the mass is in groups with @xmath125 .",
    "the luminous groups within 5 mpc all lie essentially within the mass bin @xmath126 , on the tail of the histogram seen in fig .",
    "9 . yet even with respect to such groups ,",
    "the low mass groups within 5 mpc make only a minor contribution to the mass budget .",
    "it can be concluded that they do not contain an important fraction of the mass of the universe .",
    "there is surprisingly strong evidence for variations in the relationship between blue light and mass as a function of environment . on the scale of groups ,",
    "the lowest @xmath4 values are found on mass scales of @xmath0 where typical values are @xmath1 .",
    "groups in this mass range are almost always composed of late type galaxies with ongoing star formation .",
    "groups with higher mass produce less blue light .",
    "the trend is enhanced by the local density as identified by the crossing time .",
    "high density regions , those with short crossing times , are darker .",
    "the morphology of the group members is highly correlated with these trends : groups with predominantly e / s0/sa systems have short crossing times and large @xmath4 .",
    "this pattern is consistent with a picture in which dense regions formed earlier and today star formation is largely exhausted in these places .",
    "the stellar populations are fainter and redder . possibly in these environments there",
    "have been multiple collisions between galaxies that have scattered many stars into the intracluster environment where their light goes undetected in our light inventory .",
    "then it is certainly known that the dense environments of e / s0 groups and clusters glow with thermal x - ray emission , to the degree that most of the baryons in these environments are in the hot intracluster gas and not in stars .",
    "together , these astrophysical processes could explain the observed factor of 7 increase in @xmath4 in proceeding from spiral dominated groups in the mass range @xmath0 to e / s0 dominated groups in the mass range @xmath127 .    at the other end of the mass spectrum , below @xmath2 , there is a cutoff in the visible manifestations of groups .",
    "one unlikely possibility is that there simply are few groups with less mass than @xmath2 .",
    "a more likely possibility is that group halos of lower mass exist but are difficult to identify because of a deficiency of light .",
    "we have presented evidence that such low mass groups might be common .",
    "the number of such groups that can be identified within 5  mpc are comparable to the number of luminous groups .",
    "the deficiency of light is very great in these cases , assuming that the groups are bound .",
    "groups in the mass range @xmath3 can have @xmath4 values 5 to 20 times higher than the groups of spiral galaxies in the range @xmath0 .",
    "the possibility is open that there may be halos in the dwarf group mass range and lower that are totally invisible .    as an aside , if the hypothesis of this paper is correct that groups of dwarfs are bound then the two decade old controversy between the alternatives of dark matter versus non - newtonian gravity ( milgrom 1983 ) is definitively resolved .",
    "it is implausible that the groups of dwarfs are bound by stars or gas .",
    "the relationship between the observable constituents and the gravitational field is quite unlike that of more luminous groups .",
    "the transform between light and mass is being shown to be complex .",

    "the virgo cluster has 40% of the mass attributed to groups in the volume of our study but it only contributes 15% of the blue light .",
    "the rich clusters have a dynamic importance much greater than would be expected from their light .",
    "by contrast , though there is evidence that low mass groups may be rendered almost or completely invisible , their cumulative contribution to the clustered mass of the universe seems to be small . to the limit that it can be traced ,",
    "the mass function is too flat for low mass structures to make a substantial contribution to the inventory of mass .",
