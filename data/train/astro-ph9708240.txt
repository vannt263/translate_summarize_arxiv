    "in 1972 , searle & sargent announced that two prototypical blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) were `` the first metal - poor systems of population i to be discovered '' .",
    "they posed the question of whether bcds are young galaxies in the sense that most of their star formation happened recently , or old galaxies in which star formation occurs in intense bursts separated by long quiescent intervals .",
    "an old galaxy must show evidence for the presence of an old stellar population . since bcds",
    "are generally too small and too distant to resolve into stars from the ground , studies of their stellar populations have been based on analyses of global galaxy colors and spectra . in his 1991 review ,",
    "thuan discussed several observations which , taken together , made him favor the old - galaxy hypothesis . based on spectral synthesis modeling of iue spectra , fanelli et al .",
    "( 1988 ) found that the star - formation history of bcds is best characterized by multiple , discrete star - forming episodes rather than by a single burst or a continuous star - formation rate .",
    "thuan ( 1983 ) obtained near - infrared photometry of bcds and argued he had found an old population of red giants .",
    "unfortunately , as thuan recognized , it is difficult to discriminate between a population of young red supergiants and one of old red giants using only the total infrared colors of a galaxy .",
    "campbell & terlevich ( 1984 ) obtained co indices and asserted that the population detected in the infrared is primarily composed of supergiants from the current starburst .",

    "( 1996 ) studied the optical morphology of bcds .",
    "they found that many bcds show more extended and regular morphologies in red images than in blue images , with colors becoming redder with increasing distance from the starburst centers .",
    "these observations have been interpreted to indicate the presence of `` baade s red sheet '' , the signature of an old stellar population , in some bcds . however , there are bcds which do not appear to exhibit these extended red halos",
    ".    three bcds of been observed with hst / wfpc2 , two of which are extremely metal poor and thus good candidates for primeval galaxies .",
    "but because these bcds are at distances greater than 10  mpc , even the extremely high spatial resolution of hst could not resolve any faint old stars in these galaxies .",

    ", the most metal - poor galaxy on record with an oxygen abundance estimated to be between 1/40 to 1/60 of solar , hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) successfully resolve individual massive stars with wfpc2 .",
    "however , any evolved descendants of lower - mass stars are below the detection limit ; once again , information about the galaxy s youth is limited to the integrated colors of the disk .",
    "vii  zw  403 has recently attracted attention with the rosat / pspc discovery of an extended hot gas outflow powered by the present starburst ( papaderos et al .",
    "the oxygen abundance of vii  zw  403 is about 1/15 of solar ; its hi mass is 2x10@xmath3  m@xmath4 ( tully et al .",
    "prior to the observations presented in this paper , several pieces of evidence suggested an old population might be present in vii  zw  403 .",
    "it belongs to the morphological type ie in the classification of loose & thuan , which designates irregular star - forming centers surrounded by an elliptical low - surface - brightness envelope .",
    "the red color of the unresolved disk is interpreted to indicate an old stellar population ( schulte - ladbeck & hopp 1997 ) .",
    "carozzi et al .",
    "( 1974 ) presented an optical spectrum of vii  zw  403 which displays a continuum break in the area of the ca  h and k and the g - band absorption features .",
    "vii  zw  403 resolves into single stars and/or star clusters from the ground ( e.g. , fisher & tully 1979 , tully et al . 1981 , karachentsev et al .",
    "1994 , hopp & schulte - ladbeck 1995 ) , but only a few of the most luminous objects can be discerned .",
    "we here present wfpc2 observations of the most nearby of the well - studied bcds ( kunth & svre 1986 ) , vii  zw  403  =  ugc  6456 .",
    "we demonstrate that by choosing a bcd that is nearby , we can use hst to resolve `` baade s sheet '' into single stars .",
    "we thereby show conclusively that vii  zw  403 is not a young galaxy .",
    "the hst wfpc2 observations of vii  zw  403 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we re - ran the pipeline calibration with improved calibration files , removed cosmic rays with crrej , corrected for cte using a 4% ramp , and corrected for geometric distortion using the image available from stsci .",
    "plate 1 displays the three - color ( f814w , f555w , and f336w ) image of the pc chip , illustrating the morphology of the central region of vii  zw  403 .",
    "the blue stars are clumped together , and are often associated with nebulosity , whereas the faint red stars form a nearly uniform sheet across the image .",
    "there are several thousand point sources in the pc alone ( table 1 ) ! in the interest of processing all stars identically and limiting contamination by foreground and background sources , we include only stars in the pc in our analysis .",
    "we performed photometry on h@xmath5-subtracted images .",
    "subtracting h@xmath5 had three effects .",
    "first , a few stars are line - emission sources ; these decreased in brightness by as much as a magnitude .",
    "second , many of the fainter stars ( @xmath6 ) that were detected at the 3@xmath7 level in the images without h@xmath5 subtraction are no longer detected at this level , primarily due to increased noise .",
    "this changes the appearance of the `` red tangle '' ( see below ) .",
    "third , the fainter stars which were still detected in f555w became slightly brighter ( by less than 0.1 mag for @xmath8 ) , probably thanks to better sky subtraction .",
    "we used daophot / allstar to do psf fitting for the crowded field .",
    "we chose relatively isolated stars in the image to determine the psf , after finding that this produced a better fit than using tinytim or independent observations .",
    "we calibrated the photometry with the may 1997 updated synphot tables , and used the cool & king ( 1995 ) method to maximize the performance of daophot .",
    "allstar residuals for the f555w and f814w filters remain below 0.1  mag for magnitudes less than 25.5 . for f336w",
    "the residuals exceed 0.1  mag at about 24.0  mag .",
    "we checked the completeness of our photometry for each h@xmath5-corrected image by adding a distribution of false stars consistent with the magnitude distribution of the real stars .",
    "we ran 100 simulations for each image , adding 10% of the number of real stars each time , in order to maintain the approximate level of crowding in the original image .",
    "the percentage of recovered stars indicates that there is no significant incompleteness brighter than m@xmath9  =  26 , m@xmath10  =  25 , and m@xmath11  =  25 .",
    "foreground galactic reddening for vii zw403 is e(b - v )  =  0.025 ( burstein & heiles ) ; we correct for the corresponding extinction using the tables provided in holtzman et al .",
    "tully et al .",
    "( 1981 ) find large , anomalous internal extinction near the large southern hii - region , which is included in the pc image ( see plate 1 ) .",
    "however , in our color - color diagram ( cd . fig .",
    "1 ) , we see no significant reddening for most stars . therefore , we applied no correction beyond the one for foreground extinction .",
    "it is quite possible that , as in other metal - poor dwarf galaxies ( calzetti et al .",
    "1997 ) , reddening is much larger for the ionized gas than for the diffuse stellar population .",
    "we transformed to u , v , and i magnitudes using the color terms in holtzman et al .",
    "we note that there are significant uncertainties in the transformation to u , which limit the accuracy of our extinction estimate , but do not change the shape of the [ ( v - i ) , i ] color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "figure 1 shows color - magnitude diagrams for stars in the pc .",
    "we include all objects detected to at least 3@xmath7 which were successfully fit to the psf . given the very small size of the pc and the latitude @xmath12 of vii  zw  403 , the models of ratnatunga & bahcall ( 1985 ) predict negligible foreground contamination .",
    "lee et al . ( 1993 ) showed that the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) consistently occurs at an absolute i magnitude m@xmath0@xmath1 - 4 , with only a slight dependence on metallicity .",
    "we use this method to determine the best distance estimate to date for vii  zw  403 .",
    "figure 2 shows our i - band luminosity function for the red stars only ; to bring out the red giant branch , we include only stars redward of ( v - i)@xmath13=0.7 .",
    "the trgb is so obvious as a sudden rise at i@xmath13=24.3 that we did not need to use an edge - finding algorithm .",
    "( other sources of error are much larger ! ) following the method of lee et al .",
    ", we need a value of [ fe / h ] to determine m@xmath14 .",
    "it is difficult to determine [ fe / h ] from the color of the `` red tangle '' , however , any reasonable value for [ fe / h ] does not change m@xmath14 by a large amount . using ( v - i)@xmath13@xmath11.5 and a metallicity [ fe / h ] of -1.2 , we find an absolute magnitude for the trgb in vii  zw  403 of m@xmath0@xmath13=4.10 .",
    "our error budget for the distance modulus is summarized in table 2 .",
    "the largest source of error is that from the rr lyrae distance calibration of the trgb , which we take to be 0.15 mag , following sakai et al .",

    "instead the  blue plume \" at ( v - i)@xmath13@xmath10 , which contains ms and bl stars , is equally well populated .",
    "so , while vii  zw  403 clearly exhibits a population of old stars , it has a much more abundant population of young stars than these lg - dirrs .",
    "we note that in our cmd , especially in the st filters , the low - luminosity portion of the  blue plume \" is visibly split into two distinct color bands .",
    "the bluer band is the ms , and the redder band might mark the location of the blue turn - around of the blue loops .",

    "a few high - luminosity ( m@xmath0@xmath13@xmath18 - 4 ) stars are at ( v - i)@xmath13@xmath10.3 .",
    "such a population is not apparent in the observed cmds of the dirrs , possibly removed by foreground - subtraction procedures ; however , very few foreground stars are expected in vii  zw  403 owing to its high galactic latitude and the small size of the pc .",
