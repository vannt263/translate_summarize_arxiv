    "since the pioneering work of lippmann @xcite and pellat @xcite on the influence of electrostatic potentials on the wetting of substrates by fluids , electrowetting has been simultaneously studied to address fundamental issues of surface science , e.g. , electrocapillarity @xcite , the structure of solid - fluid interfaces @xcite , or the characterization of surface states @xcite , as well as to develop novel applications , e.g. , driving , mixing , or shaping of droplets in lab - on - a - chip devices , optical applications , or microelectromechanical systems @xcite . in the past electrowetting at low voltages",
    "was commonly interpreted as an electrocapillarity effect , i.e. , it is assumed to hinge on the voltage - dependence of the substrate - fluid interfacial tension @xcite . a justification for this approach is frequently given in terms of the vast experimental evidence for systems of uncoated and hydrophobically coated electrodes .",
    "the present work reports on an effort to understand electrowetting in the context of general wetting phenomena @xcite . within classical microscopic",
    "density functional theory one has access to the interfacial structure of fluids so that one can study , e.g. , the contact angle as a function of the electrostatic substrate potential .",
    "however , it turned out that the commonly given derivations of the electrowetting equation @xcite are incorrect in that interfacial properties , e.g. , interfacial tensions or differential capacitances , which describe the contact of _ one _ fluid with a substrate , enter the equation describing the contact of _ two _ fluids with a substrate .",
    "it has been overlooked that the interfacial structure , and thus interfacial quantities , of a fluid can change upon bringing it into contact with another fluid .",
    "although the interfacial structure close of fluids to substrates has been deeply examined in the surface science literature @xcite , its properties seem to be largely ignored in the context of electrowetting so far . by ignoring structural differences which occur at substrate - fluid interfaces upon bringing two fluids in simultaneous contact with a substrate , one can interpret electrowetting as a consequence of voltage - dependent interfacial tensions , which is referred to as the electrocapillarity approach to electrowetting in the following .",
    "it is shown in this work that electrowetting _ can not _ be consistently understood as an electrocapillarity effect .",
    "alternative approaches to interpret electrowetting as a line tension effect have been proposed @xcite but some of the predictions were in disagreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the present approach is to study electrowetting in terms of the the effective interface potential @xcite , which is related to the macroscopic contact angle .",
    "the effective interface potential has been analyzed recently for simple models of electrolyte solutions @xcite , showing the general feature of ions inducing wetting transitions of first order .",
    "whereas wetting transitions are concerned with the _ thickness _ of wetting films , the contact angle is related to the _ depth _ of the effective interface potential , which always vanishes continuously at wetting transitions @xcite . in the following the effective interface potential for pellat s classical setup of a vertical parallel plate capacitor @xcite",
    "is determined and used to derive an electrowetting equation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) based on the density functional theory of wetting .",
    "this setup has been chosen because its geometry is precisely defined , an issue which has been recently raised in a critical discussion of the more common setup of a droplet on a substrate with the counter electrode being a thin wire @xcite .",
    "the misconception underlying the classical derivation of the electrowetting equation within the electrocapillarity approach is discussed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the electrocapillarity - based electrowetting equation seems to be a good approximation for systems investigated up to now , i.e. , uncoated or hydrophobically coated electrodes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "however , it is argued that the difference in the predicted electrowetting numbers between the electrocapillarity approach and the present one based on the density function theory of wetting can be expected to occur , e.g. , for hydrophilically coated electrodes or for two immiscible electrolyte solutions as fluids ( sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) . in view of the conceptional problems of the electrocapillarity approach it",
    "is suggested to rather interpret electrowetting in terms of the density functional theory of wetting ( sec .",
