    "separation theorems have shown to play a key role in the design of the divide and conquer algorithms , as well as solving extremal problems in combinatorial topology and geometry .",
    "the earliest result in this area is a result of lipton and tarjan @xcite that asserts any @xmath15 vertex planar graph can be separated into two subgraphs with at most @xmath16 vertices by removing only @xmath17 vertices .",
    "this result is extended by many authors including miller et al @xcite , fox and pach @xcite , @xcite , and chan @xcite .",
    "clearly if a graph contain a large clique , then it can not have a separation property that resembles the planar case .",
    "fox and pach @xcite have recently studied the string graphs which contain the class of planar graphs , and have shown that when these graphs do not contain a @xmath18 , of fixed size @xmath19 , as a subgraph , then a suitable separator exits .",
    "although this powerful result is extremely effective in solving extremal problems , its computational power is limited to graphs that do not contain a `` large '' complete bipartite subgraph .",
    "chan @xcite studied the problem of computing the packing and piercing numbers of fat objects in @xmath20 , where the dimension @xmath21 is fixed .",
    "he drastically improved the running time of the first polynomial time approximation scheme ( ptas ) for packing of fat objects due to erlebach et al @xcite , and also provided the first ptas for the piercing problem of fat objects .",
    "parts of chan s @xcite work involved proving a separation theorem with respect to the abstract concept of a measure on fat objects . motivated by his work",
    "we have defined the notation of a measure in a more combinatorial fashion on graphs .",
    "furthermore , we have proven a combinatorial separation theorem .",
    "it should however be noted that the results in @xcite do not imply ours , and our results do not apply to the general fat objects .",
    "let @xmath1 be a function that assigns non - negative values to subgraphs of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath1 is called a measure function if the following hold .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 , if @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , if @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , if there are no edges between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "central to our result is a length concept similar to the bandwidth .",
    "let @xmath2 be a graph with @xmath32 and @xmath33 and let @xmath34 be a clique cover in @xmath2 . for any @xmath35 , define @xmath36 to be @xmath37 .",

    "we refer to @xmath40 as the _ length _ of @xmath4 in @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to note that when @xmath40 is small , then @xmath4 exhibits some nice separation properties .",
    "for instance , one can partition @xmath43 into blocks of @xmath40 consecutive cliques of @xmath2 , and argue that removal of any block separates @xmath4 . particularly , when @xmath44 , then one can separate @xmath4 by removing one clique form @xmath2 .",
    "similar important concepts such as treewidth , pathwidth , and bandwidth have been introduced in the past @xcite , but none is identical to the concept of length introduced here .",

    "moreover as we will see , there is a simple but important connection between @xmath47 and the dimension of interval orders .",
    "+ recall that a chordal graph does not have a chordless cycle of length at least 4 .",
    "our main result which is theorem [ t1 ] is a generalization of the result stated earlier in the abstract , to @xmath48 graphs , where @xmath49 is a chordal graph .",
    "[ t1 ]    _ let @xmath1 be a measure on @xmath50 , and let @xmath51 be graphs with @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath53 so that @xmath49 is chordal .",
    "then there is a vertex separator @xmath11 in @xmath4 whose removal separates @xmath4 into two subgraph so that each subgraph has a measure of at most @xmath5 . in addition",
    ", the induced graph of @xmath4 on @xmath11 can be covered with at most @xmath54 many cliques from @xmath4 , where @xmath55 . _",
    "proof of theorem [ t1 ] combines the clique separation properties of chordal graphs and perfect elimination trees , together with the properties associated with the length of a graph .",
    "the theorem either finds a suitable clique separator in the chordal graph @xmath49 , or identifies a graph @xmath56 , for which the cardinality of the clique cover is large , and the separates @xmath4 using length properties .",
    "an effective application of theorem [ t1 ] to a specific problem normally requires to define @xmath1 so that , @xmath57 , for an appropriate clique cover @xmath58 in @xmath4 .",
    "the time complexity of finding the separator depends on the structure of the measure and how fast we can compute the measure on any subgraph . in typical applications of interest with @xmath59 , the separation algorithm can be implemented to run better than @xmath60 .",
    "proper applications of theorem [ t1 ] gives rise to the following .",
    "_ let @xmath50 be the intersection graph of a set of axis parallel unit height rectangles in the plane .",

    "observe that @xmath72 , the incomparability graphs for @xmath73 is an interval graph , @xmath74 , and hence is chordal .",
    "it is further easy to verify that @xmath75 .",
    "finally , let @xmath58 be a @xmath76approximate solution for the clique cover number of @xmath4 that also provides for a @xmath77approximate solution to independence number of @xmath4 , and for any induced subgraph @xmath78 , define @xmath79 to be the restriction of @xmath58 to @xmath78 .",
    "( note that @xmath80 can be computed in @xmath81 time @xcite . )",
    "+ for obtaining the sub - exponential time algorithm one can adopt the method in @xcite proposed for planar graphs , by enumerating independent sets inside of separator and then recursively applying theorem [ t1 ] to @xmath4 . for the ptas , one can also use the original approach in @xcite adopted by chan @xcite , by recursively separating @xmath4 , but terminating the recursion when for a subgraph @xmath78 , @xmath82 and then applying the sub - exponential algorithm to @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath83 + similarly , one can prove the following .",

    "there is an algorithm for computing the minimum number of discs of unit diameter needed to cover all points in @xmath91 that gives an answer in @xmath92 time , and @xmath93 storage where @xmath94 is the value of an optimal solution .",

    "let @xmath106 @xmath74 be the incomparability interval graph associated with @xmath73 , and note that points in any vertical strip of the grid constitute a clique of @xmath14 and hence @xmath107 + for any @xmath98 , @xmath108 , place two discs in the plane that has @xmath103 and @xmath104 in its boundary and call the resulting multi - set of discs @xmath109 , and note that @xmath110 . if @xmath4 is disconnected , then we would solve the problem for each component , and take the union of the solutions , so we will assume that @xmath4 is connected .",
    "thus , we can assume with no loss of generality that any feasible solution @xmath111 for any @xmath112 is a subset of @xmath109 , for otherwise we can replace any @xmath113 by one disc from @xmath109 .",
