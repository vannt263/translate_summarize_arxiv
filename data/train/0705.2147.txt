    "the theory of computational complexity  @xcite establishes a classification of constraint satisfaction problems ( csp ) according to their difficulty in the worst case . for concreteness",
    "let us introduce the three problems we shall use as running examples in the paper :    * @xmath0-xorsat .",
    "find a vector @xmath1 of boolean variables satisfying the linear equations @xmath2 , where each row of the @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 contains exactly @xmath0 non - null elements , and @xmath5 is a given boolean vector . *",
    "@xmath6-coloring ( @xmath6-col ) .",
    "given a graph , assign one of @xmath6 colors to each of its vertices , without giving the same color to the two extremities of an edge .",
    "* @xmath0-satisfiability ( @xmath0-sat ) .",
    "find a solution of a boolean formula made of the conjunction ( logical and ) of clauses , each made of the disjunction ( logical or ) of @xmath0 literals ( a variable or its logical negation ) .",
    "each of these problems admits several variants . in the decision version one has to assert the existence or not of a solution , for instance a proper coloring of a given graph .",
    "more elaborate questions are the estimation of the number of such solutions , or , in the absence of solution , the discovery of optimal configurations , for instance colorings minimizing the number of monochromatic edges .",
    "the decision variant of the three examples stated above fall into two distinct complexity classes : @xmath0-xorsat is in the p class , while the two others are np - complete for @xmath7 ( see  @xcite for a classification of generic boolean csps ) .",
    "this means that the existence of a solution of the xorsat problem can be decided in a time growing polynomially with the number of variables , for any instance of the problem ; one can indeed use the gaussian elimination algorithm . on the contrary",
    "no fast algorithm able of solving every coloring or satisfiability problem is known , and the existence of such a polynomial time algorithm is considered as highly improbable .    this notion of computational complexity , being based on worst - case considerations , could overlook the possibility that `` most '' of the instances of an np problem are in fact easy and that the difficult cases are very rare .",
    "random ensembles of problems have thus been introduced in order to give a quantitative content to this notion of typical instances ; a property of a problem will be considered as typical if its probability ( with respect to the random choice of the instance ) goes to one in the limit of large problem sizes .",
    "most random ensembles depend on an external parameter that can be varied continuously . in the coloring problem",
    "one can for instance consider the traditional erds - rnyi random graphs  @xcite which are parameterized by their mean connectivity @xmath8 . for ( xor)sat instances",
    "this role is played by the ratio @xmath9 of the number of constraints ( clauses for sat or rows in the matrix for xorsat ) to the number of variables .",
    "a remarkable threshold phenomenon , first observed numerically  @xcite , occurs when this parameter is varied : when a particular value @xmath10 is crossed from below , the instances go from typically satisfiable to typically unsatisfiable .",
    "this statement has been rigorously proven for xorsat  @xcite and for 2-sat  @xcite , in the other cases it is only a largely accepted conjecture , with sharpness condition on the width of the transition window  @xcite and bounds on its possible location  @xcite .",
    "threshold phenomena are largely studied in statistical mechanics under the name of phase transitions .",
    "there is moreover a natural analogy between optimization problems and statistical mechanics ; if one defines the energy as the number of violated constraints , for instance the number of monochromatic edges , the optimal configurations of a problem coincide with the groundstates of the associated physical system , an antiferromagnetic potts model in the coloring case .",
    "this analogy triggered a large amount of research , relying on methods of statistical mechanics of disordered systems originally devised for the study of mean - field spin - glasses  @xcite .",
    "early examples of this approach for the satisfiability and coloring problems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting outcomes of this line of research  @xcite has been the suggestion that other structural threshold phenomenon take place before the satisfiability one smaller than @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "these values are however largely algorithm - dependent and not directly related to a change of structure in the configuration space . ] .",
    "the set of solutions of a random csp , viewed as a subset of the whole configuration space , is smooth at low values of the constraint ratio but becomes fragmented into clusters of solutions for intermediate values of the control parameter , @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this clustering transition has been rigorously demonstrated in the xorsat case  @xcite , for which it has a simple geometric interpretation .",
    "@xmath13 is indeed the threshold for the percolation of the 2-core of the hypergraph underlying the csp ; between @xmath13 and @xmath11 there is typically a finite fraction of the variables and constraints in a peculiar sub - formula known as the backbone .",
    "every solution of the backbone gives birth to a cluster of the complete formula .",
    "the variables of the backbone are said to be frozen in a given cluster , i.e. they take the same value in all the solutions belonging to a cluster ; this is merely a consequence of the definition of a cluster in this case .",
    "establishing a precise and generic definition of the clusters is not an easy task , not to speak about proving tight rigorous results on their existence or properties ( for recent results in this direction see  @xcite ) . even at the heuristic level , it was recently argued  @xcite that the computation of @xmath13 for random satisfiability ( or @xmath14 for coloring ) by previous statistical mechanics studies  @xcite was incorrect . roughly speaking , in these two models",
    ", the sizes of the clusters can have large fluctuations  @xcite that must be taken into consideration . in  @xcite the existence of yet another threshold ( for @xmath15 ) @xmath16 $ ] was also pointed out ; this condensation threshold separates two clustered regimes , one where the relevant clusters are exponentially numerous ( for smaller values of @xmath9 ) and the other where there is only a sub - exponential number of them .",
    "the clustering transition of xorsat , because of its geometric interpretation , is certainly a good example on which developing one s intuition of the clustering phenomenon .",
    "there are however at least two aspects in which xorsat departs from other csp and where the intuitive picture must be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "the first is that the clusters of xorsat all have the same size , because of the linear algebra structure of its set of solutions .",
    "for this reason the condensation phenomenon is not present in xorsat .",
    "the second point is that clusters of xorsat have frozen variables , by definition .",
    "there is however no obvious reason that this should be true for any csp . on the contrary",
    "we shall argue in this paper that in general frozen variables appear at another value @xmath17 of the control parameter , with generically @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this was one of the results of  @xcite , here we shall develop this point and quantify the precursors of the transition before @xmath17 .",
    "for this we build upon the study of xorsat presented in  @xcite and extend it to generic csps , in particular satisfiability and coloring . the central notion studied here",
    "is the one of rearrangement ( to some extent related to the long - range frustration of  @xcite ) : given an initial solution of a csp and a variable @xmath19 that one would like to modify , a rearrangement is a path in configuration space that starts from the initial solution and leads to another solution where the value of the @xmath19th variable is changed with respect to the initial one .",
    "the minimal length of such a path is a measure of how constrained was the variable @xmath19 in the initial configuration . in intuitive terms",
    "this length diverges with the system size when the variable was frozen in the initial cluster .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_def ] we introduce a generic class of csps and precise the definition of the rearrangements .",
    "sections  [ sec_tree ] and [ sec_results ] are devoted to modified ( tree ) random ensembles in which the approach is essentially rigorous ; the former presents detailed computations in a rather generic setting and its application to the three selected examples , while the latter presents the numerical results and discuss the generic phenomenology at the approach of the freezing transition in the tree ensembles , with some more technical details deferred to app .  [ sec_app ] .",
    "the computation is reconsidered in the perspective of the reconstruction problem in sec .",
    "[ sec_reconstruction ] .",
    "the applicability of these results to the original ensembles is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_rgraph ] , through a precise statement of the hypotheses of the cavity method .",
    "conclusions and perspectives for future work are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec_conclu ] .",
    "we introduce here some notations and definitions for a class of problems that encompasses the three examples we shall treat in more details .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the csp will be @xmath20 variables @xmath21 taking values in a discrete alphabet @xmath22 ; global configurations are denoted @xmath23 .",
    "an instance ( or formula ) @xmath24 of the csp is a set of @xmath25 constraints between the variables @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath26th constraint is defined by a function @xmath27 , which depends on the configuration of a subset of the variables @xmath28 and is equal to 1 if the constraint is satisfied , 0 otherwise .",
    "the set @xmath29 of solutions of @xmath24 is composed of the configurations satisfying simultaneously all the constraints .",
    "it can thus be formally defined as @xmath30 , where the indicator function @xmath31 is @xmath32 when the formula admits a positive number of solutions , call it @xmath33 , the uniform measure over the solutions is denoted @xmath34 .",
    "factor graphs  @xcite provide an useful representation of a csp .",
    "these graphs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_factor ] for an example ) have two kind of nodes . variable nodes ( filled circles on the figure ) are associated to the degrees of freedom @xmath21 , while constraint nodes ( empty squares ) represent the clauses @xmath35 . an edge between constraint @xmath26 and variable @xmath19",
    "is drawn whenever @xmath35 depends on @xmath21 .",
    "the neighborhood @xmath36 of a constraint node is the set of variable nodes that appear in @xmath28 .",
    "conversely @xmath37 is the set of constraints that depend on @xmath21 .",
    "we shall conventionally use the indices @xmath38 for the variable nodes , @xmath39 for the constraints , and denote @xmath40 the subtraction from a set .",
    "two variable nodes are called adjacent if they appear in a common constraint .",
    "the graph distance between two variable nodes @xmath19 and @xmath41 is the number of constraint nodes encountered on a shortest path linking @xmath19 and @xmath41 ( formally infinite if the two variables are not in the same connected component of the graph ) .     and @xmath42,width=226 ]",
    "the three illustrative examples presented above admits a simple representation in this formalism :    * @xmath0-xorsat .",
    "the degrees of freedom of this csp are boolean variables that we shall represent , following the physics conventions , by ising spins , @xmath43 .",
    "each constraint involves a subset of @xmath0 variables , @xmath44 , and reads @xmath45 , where here and in the following @xmath46 denotes the indicator function of an event and @xmath47 is a given constant .",
    "this is equivalent to the definition given in the introduction : defining @xmath48 such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the constraint imposed by @xmath35 reads @xmath51 , which is nothing but the @xmath26th row of the matrix equation @xmath52 .",
    "the addition modulo 2 of boolean variables can also be read as the binary exclusive or operation , hence the name xorsat used for this problem .",
    "* @xmath6-col . here",
    "@xmath53 is the set of allowed colors on the @xmath20 vertices of a graph .",
    "each edge @xmath26 connecting the vertices @xmath19 and @xmath41 prevents them from being of the same color : @xmath54 . * @xmath0-sat . as in the xorsat problem one",
    "deals with ising represented boolean variables , but in each clause the xor operation between variables is replaced by an or between literals ( i.e. a variable or its negation ) . in other words a constraint @xmath26 is unsatisfied only when all literals evaluate to false , or in ising terms when all spins @xmath21 involved in the constraint take their wrong value that we denote @xmath55 : @xmath56 .",
    "the random ensembles of csps instances we shall use are defined as follows :    * @xmath0-xorsat . for each of the @xmath25 clauses",
    "@xmath26 a @xmath0-uplet of distinct variable indices @xmath57 is chosen uniformly at random among the @xmath58 possible ones , and the constant @xmath59 is taken to be @xmath60 with probability one - half . *",
    "a set of @xmath25 among the @xmath61 possible edges @xmath62 is chosen uniformly at random . *",
    "the variables @xmath63 are chosen as in the xorsat ensemble , and the @xmath55 are independently taken to be @xmath60 with equal probability .",
    "for the coloring problem this construction is the classical erds - rnyi random graph @xmath64 , the two other cases are its random hypergraph generalization .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic limit of large instances where @xmath20 and @xmath25 both diverge with a fixed ratio @xmath65   can be replaced by the ensemble @xmath66 where each edge is present independently with probability @xmath67 , such that the average number of edges is close to @xmath25 .",
    "the choice of the ( hyper)edges with or without replacement is also irrelevant . ] .",
    "random ( hyper)graphs have many interesting properties in this limit  @xcite . for instance",
    "the degree of a variable node of the factor graph converges to a poisson law of average @xmath68 for the xorsat and sat cases , and @xmath69 for the coloring ensemble . for clarity in the latter case we shall use the notation @xmath70 for the average connectivity .",
    "moreover , picking at random one variable node @xmath19 and isolating the subgraph induced by the variable nodes at a graph distance smaller than a given constant @xmath71 yields , with a probability going to one in the thermodynamic limit , a ( random ) tree .",
    "this tree can be described by a galton - watson branching process : the root @xmath19 belongs to @xmath72 constraints , where @xmath72 is a poisson random variable of parameter @xmath68 ( @xmath8 in the coloring case ) .",
    "the variable nodes adjacent to @xmath19 give themselves birth to new constraints , in numbers which are independently poisson distributed with the same parameter .",
    "this reproduction process is iterated on @xmath71 generations , until the variable nodes at graph distance @xmath71 from the initial root @xmath19 have been generated .",
    "we now define the main object of our study .",
    "first recall the well - known definition of the hamming distance between two configurations , @xmath73 .",
    "consider an initial solution of the formula , @xmath74 , and imagine one wants to modify the value of the variable @xmath19 .",
    "a rearranged solution is a new configuration @xmath75 such that @xmath76 .",
    "the minimal size of a rearrangement ( m.s.r . ) for variable @xmath19 starting from @xmath74 is defined as @xmath77 and measures how costly",
    "( in terms of hamming distance ) it is to perturb the solution at variable @xmath19   takes the same value in every solution we formally define @xmath78 . ] .",
    "it can also be viewed as the minimal length of a path in configuration space , modifying one variable at a time , between @xmath79 and another solution with a different value of variable @xmath19 , thus providing a quantification of how much constrained was initially this variable .",
    "we shall also speak of the support of a rearrangement as the set of variables which differ in the initial and final configurations , the size of the rearrangement being the cardinality of its support .    in general",
    "the m.s.r . will depend on the starting configuration , we thus define its distribution with respect to an uniform choice of @xmath79 ( in abbreviation m.s.r.d . ) , @xmath80 there should be no possibility of confusion between the distribution @xmath81 and the number @xmath6 of allowed colors in the @xmath6-col problem .",
    "when dealing with random csps we shall study the average of this distribution , @xmath82 where the expectation is taken with respect to the instance ensemble ( in the cases considered here all variable nodes are equivalent on average ) .",
    "its behavior in the thermodynamic limit will drastically change with the connectivity parameter @xmath9 ( or @xmath8 for the coloring ) .",
    "we shall indeed define the threshold @xmath17 ( @xmath83 ) as the value above which a finite fraction of the distribution @xmath81 is supported on sizes @xmath84 that diverge with the number of variables . in pictorial terms clusters acquire frozen variables at this point , their rearrangements must be of diverging size and thus lead to a final solution outside the initial cluster .    the computation of the average m.s.r.d .",
    "will be first undertaken in a random tree ensemble , mimicking the tree neighborhoods of the random graphs .",
    "the threshold for the freezing transition in these tree instances will be computed , along with a set of exponents characterizing the behavior of the average m.s.r.d . when the transition is approached from the unfrozen phase . for clarity",
    "we shall denote @xmath85 instead of @xmath17 the thresholds in the tree ensembles .",
    "we shall then argue in sec .",
    "[ sec_rgraph ] , on the basis of the non - rigorous cavity method , that for some values of @xmath9 and @xmath0 the properties of the random graphs instances are correctly described by the computations in the tree ensemble . in particular for large enough values of @xmath0 we shall conjecture that @xmath86 .",
    "we will also explain how the computation has to be amended to handle the more elaborated version of the cavity method ( with replica - symmetry breaking ) , and what are the expectedly universal characteristics of the critical behavior at the freezing transition .",
    "in this and the next section all the instances of csp encountered have an underlying factor graph which is a finite tree .",
    "given such a formula @xmath24 ( or equivalently its factor graph ) and an edge @xmath87 between a variable node @xmath19 and an adjacent constraint node @xmath26 , we define two sub formulas ( cavity graphs ) @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath88 is obtained from @xmath24 by deleting the branch of the formula rooted at @xmath19 starting with constraint @xmath26 . conversely @xmath89 is obtained by keeping only this branch ( see fig .",

    "this can be done by computing separately these costs in the factor graphs @xmath89 for all the constraint nodes @xmath26 around @xmath19 and then patching together the rearrangements of the sub - formulae . rearranging a factor graph",
    "@xmath89 amounts to looking for a configuration of the variables @xmath99 which satisfies the interaction @xmath26 and which provokes a minimal propagation of the rearrangement in the branches @xmath100 .    to formalize this reasoning",
