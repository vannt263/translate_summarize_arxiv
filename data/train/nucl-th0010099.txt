    "the investigation of hadronic transitions of baryon resonances is currently of high interest @xcite . on the experimental side , there are considerable efforts to measure these reactions in order to gain more and improved data on the resonance states . on the theoretical side ,",
    "a quantitative description of the very details of the baryon ground and excited states represents a big challenge for all hadron models .",
    "obviously the aim is to reach a comprehensive understanding of the low - energy hadron phenomenology on the basis of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .    a promising approach to low - energy hadrons consists in constituent quark models ( cqms ) .",
    "starting from rudimentary attempts more than two decades ago , one has constantly improved the description and gained a lot of insight into the properties of hadrons at low and intermediate energies .",
    "evidently , cqms can at most be effective models of qcd in a domain where the fundamental theory is not ( yet ) accurately solvable",
    ". however , the concept of constituent quarks , in the beginning mainly motivated by symmetry considerations of hadron multiplets , nowadays gets more and more justified on the basis of qcd itself @xcite .",
    "it appears that the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath3s ) of qcd is responsible for the generation of constituent quarks as quasiparticles below a certain scale .",
    "numerous evidences hint to a chirally broken phase ( nambu - goldstone mode ) of qcd .",
    "recently a chiral constituent quark model ( ccqm ) has been proposed that exploits the sb@xmath3s of qcd in deducing the hyperfine interaction of constituent quarks in light and strange baryons @xcite .",
    "it relies on constituent - quark and goldstone - boson fields as the relevant degrees of freedom in an effective interaction lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the so - called goldstone - boson exchange ( gbe ) cqm introduces new symmetry properties into the the hyperfine interaction of constituent quarks , which are rather different from traditional cqms advocating one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "the gbe cqm has turned out rather successful in producing an accurate description of the whole light and strange baryon phenomenology in a unified framework @xcite .    however , the reproduction of the baryon ground - state and resonance energies is just one item that has to be fulfilled by a successful hadron model .",
    "in addition , any cqm should also provide for a description of dynamical properties accessible through all types of reaction processes . here",
    "we specifically study the performance of the gbe cqm in hadronic decays of @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances .",
    "thereby we produce a further test of the reliability of the new kind of hyperfine interaction based on gbe .",
    "we obtain three - quark wave functions for all the needed ground and excited baryon states by solving a differential schrdinger - type equation with the stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite .",
    "these wave functions are then employed within a modified version of the @xmath2 decay model @xcite in order to calculate partial widths for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays of @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonance states up to @xmath61.8 gev .",
    "we compare the results to the experimental data and contrast them to an analogous study along a traditional version of the oge cqm @xcite .",
    "our main aim is twofold : first we want to see how well the available data are reproduced by the gbe cqm , and second we wish to find possible differences between the two distinct types of cqms .    in the following chapter",
    "we give a short description of the quark models used in the present study .",
    "we specify their parametrizations both in a nonrelativistic and a semirelativistic framework . in chapter 3",
    "we explain the specific decay model we use here and give the pertinent formulae for the calculation of partial decay widths .",
    "the results are presented in chapter 4 along with a discussion of their sensitivity on different ingredients both in the cqms and in the decay model .",
    "our conclusions are given in chapter 5 .",
    "let us start by specifying the constituent quark models we use in the present study .",
    "the total three - quark hamiltonian for baryons has the general form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinetic - energy operator and @xmath9 contains all the quark - quark interactions , i.e. confinement plus hyperfine potentials . for constituent quarks with effective masses of the order of a few hundred mev",

    "it helps to avoid pathologies that usually appear in nonrelativistic constituent quark models @xcite .",
    "we devote our attention primarily to the sr versions of the gbe and oge cqms as described below .",
    "nevertheless , in order to provide a connection to previous studies of hadronic baryon decays , we consider also nonrelativistic ( nr ) versions of the two types of cqms , which use the kinetic - energy operator in the form@xmath13      for the ccqm relying on gbe dynamics we specifically adhere to the version published in ref .",

    "specifically , the s - wave resonances @xmath227 and @xmath229 ( and likewise also @xmath233 ) appear to be structure - dependent , following the terminology of ref .",
    "this behaviour results in widths sometimes orders of magnitudes apart for different models . on the other hand ,",
    "the d - wave resonances @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 ( and likewise also @xmath237 ) are found to be structure - independent. their decay widths are practically independent of the underlying spectroscopic model .",
    "these properties can be easily understood in the framework of the eem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion ) , and evidently extend to the @xmath2 model , which is qualitatively very similar for orbital excitations .",
    "the decay widths for the @xmath5 resonances are practically all correct for the sr gbe cqm . in case of the other models the one or the other shortcoming appears .",
    "table [ tab1 ] also gives the results for @xmath1 decays .",
    "here we use the same spatial part for the meson wave function as for @xmath0 decays but the constant @xmath101 is adjusted so as to reproduce the @xmath1 decay width of the @xmath227 resonance .",
    "note that this gives values for @xmath101 about a factor 3 smaller than for the @xmath0 decays , in contrast to other works @xcite , where the same value was employed to describe both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "this has several reasons , the most imminent one being the replacement according to eq .",
    "( [ replacement1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we use an unmixed flavor wave function for the @xmath1 meson , i.e. a pure flavor octet state . for non - strange decays as regarded in this work , a possible mixing would only influence the normalization of this wave function , which can effectively be absorbed into the coupling constant @xmath101 .",
    "finally , an important contribution comes from our choice of phase space , as given by eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) .",
    "we use a fully relativistic prescription and experimental values for the meson masses , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where a much higher ,  effective  value for the pion mass was employed .",
    "a quick estimate of the magnitudes of these three effects shows indeed that we end up with about a factor of 3 difference in the constant @xmath101 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "the @xmath1 widths of the roper resonance @xmath221 for the gbe parametrizations ( nr as well as sr ) are rigourously zero , since in both cases the theoretically predicted masses lie below the @xmath1 threshold , in accordance with experiment . for the oge parametrizations , the decay @xmath238 is possible ,",
    "the corresponding widths remain rather small , however .    in total , there are four resonances predicted with considerable branching ratios in the @xmath1 decay channel . only for the @xmath227 and @xmath229 resonances one can compare to experiment , since these are the only ones with an experimental width assigned by the pdg @xcite .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the experimental decay widths in both of these cases are missed by all theoretical models .",
    "this is again reminiscent of the eem , where a similar effect is found .",
    "one may expect that the decays of these resonances are quite sensitive to spin - orbit and/or tensor forces in the quark - quark interaction .",
    "the inclusion of these force components would probably improve the description of both @xmath239 and @xmath240 decays for these resonances .",
    "in addition to @xmath227 and @xmath229 , also the widths of the @xmath223 and the @xmath224 resonances come out appreciably large .",
    "the pdg does not quote any experimental data for these states .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that their widths are vanishing or too small to be measured .",
    "it may simply be the case that experimental ambiguities do not ( yet ) allow for a reliable determination .",
    "in fact , there are single partial - wave analyses that assign an appreciable @xmath1 decay width , for example , also to the @xmath223 , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the modified @xmath2 decay model has two decisive ingredients : the pair - creation strength @xmath101 and the parameter determining the extension of the meson wave function .",
    "while the former is merely a multiplicative constant , which may be suitably chosen to scale the overall strength of all decays , the latter is a nonlinear parameter , which may also alter the qualitative features of various predictions . in the following we consider certain different choices of the meson wave functions and examine their influences on the decay widths .    in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we show results for decay widths when employing a yukawa - like meson wave function , as given by eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) , producing the same meson size as the gaussian parametrization before .",
    "we have adjusted the parameter @xmath101 again to fit the @xmath5 and @xmath227 widths for @xmath239 and @xmath1 decays , respectively . however , as compared to table [ tab1 ] , the values change only little in this case .",

    "this is understandable , since in order to recover the results of the pointlike meson limit , one has to compensate for the effect of the @xmath23 function , which then replaces the meson wave function . in particular , for the gaussian form of eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) one has the relation    @xmath307    most of the results for the decay widths are now rather different from before .",
    "they follow the general trend towards the predictions typical for the eem .",
    "one of the characteristic results of the eem is the extremely small decay width of the roper resonance , as the first radial excitation of the nucleon ; it is due to the orthogonality of the initial and final - state wave functions , which is strikingly felt in case of the eem .",
    "the results of table [ tab4 ] show the corresponding trend rather clearly : for all spectroscopic models the @xmath221 widths come out at least a factor of 2 smaller than before , while one is still rather far away from the pointlike limit .",
    "concerning the @xmath1 decays one observes that the differences in the widths between the @xmath227 and @xmath229 resonances now increase in all cases .",
    "again this follows the ( unpleasant ) trend towards the predictions typical for the eem . as a result it appears favourable to use a decay model that permits the use of meson wave functions with finite extensions .",
    "in this work we investigated the theoretical description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays for @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances . in the first instance we were interested in the predictions of the specific chiral constituent - quark model",
    "whose hyperfine interaction is based on gbe dynamics @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison to the modern experimental data base @xcite is provided .",
    "we also studied the results relative to the predictions by a traditional cqm @xcite based on oge but relying on the same type of force components as the gbe cqm .",
    "furthermore we investigated the differences between a semirelativistic and a nonrelativistic description of the baryon states for both types of cqms .",
    "for the decay mechanism a modified version of the @xmath2 model @xcite was employed .",
    "we also examined the sensitivity of the results on the ingredients entering the decay operator , notably the analytical form and the extension of the meson wave functions .",
    "from the present results it is still difficult to draw definite conclusions about the quality of the wave functions stemming from different cqms .",
    "in fact , the various decay widths seem to be more determined by the choice of the sr or nr parametrizations rather than by the use of either type of dynamics , gbe or oge . at this stage , we find a number of gross qualitative features that have been observed already before in similar studies along the classical @xmath2 decay model .",
    "it should be recalled that here we have not included spin - orbit or tensor forces into the quark - model hamiltonians , especially because these force components are not yet provided by the published versions of the gbe cqm and we wanted to produce a consistent comparison with the other type of dynamics , namely the one resulting from oge .",
    "some decay widths are certainly sensitive to tensor and spin - orbit components in the wave functions . in this respect",
    "it may have been somewhat premature to make a comparison with experimental data at this stage .    in any case , our study reveals ( and confirms previous such findings ) that the description of strong decays of baryon resonances within present cqms is not yet fully satisfactory .",
    "the reasons for the persisting difficulties may on the one hand reside in the baryon wave functions , which are probably not yet realistic enough .",
    "on the other hand one must realize that the @xmath2 decay model may also fall short as it is based on intuitive grounds and lacks a firm theoretical foundation .",
    "a consistent microscopic description of the strong - decay processes within the framework of cqms thus remains a challenging task .",
    "one can think of a number of improvements to be done .",
    "for example , the proper inclusion of relativistic effects appears mandatory . the ultimate goal would , of course , be a unified description of the resonance spectra and the hadronic , as well as electromagnetic , transitions with the same dynamical scheme .",
