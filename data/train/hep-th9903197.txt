    "one of the most interesting aspects of light - front field theory ( lfft)@xcite is that it shares many features with non - relativistic field theory , due to the simple vacuum .",
    "it makes the hamiltonian method sensible and thus lfft becomes an attractive framework for bound state problems . to my knowledge , however , only very limited techniques which are common in non - relativistic many - body problems have been used in the lf context , e.g. , the tamm - dancoff approximation@xcite and a boson expansion method@xcite . in order to fully exploit the advantages of lfft , it is desirable to consider the possibility of the application of other many - body techniques to lfft .    in this paper , we consider a kind of random phase approximation ( rpa ) applied to bound state equations . in the usual rpa , only one - loop vacuum polarization diagrams ( rings ) are summed up@xcite . here",
    "we replace the vacuum polarization with the `` meson '' intermediate states obtained by the bound state equation , as we did in a previous paper@xcite .",
    "thus our bound state equation is a self - consistent one .    the motivation for this approximation are two - fold : ( 1 ) the most popular method of solving the bound state problems in lfft is hamiltonian diagonalization based on the fock representation . in the crudest approximation , a meson is described as a @xmath0 valence state .",
    "( in general , such a description is very good in lfft . )",
    "however it becomes rapidly more difficult to include higher fock states .",
    "this difficulty leads to the idea of effective hamiltonians@xcite which include the effects of higher fock states .",
    "a problem in this approach is that the effective hamiltonians are obtained only perturbatively . in particular ,",
    "it has not been considered to include _ infinitely _ many fock states .",
    "( 2 ) in a previous paper@xcite on the theta vacuum in the massive schwinger model , we have shown that the vacuum polarization effects are very important for the low - energy physics .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider such effects in the calculations of meson states even in the absence of theta .",
    "another important point in the previous work is that the vacuum polarization is approximately represented as intermediate `` meson '' states obtained by the ( two - body ) bound state equation .    in order to make the idea as concrete as possible",
    ", we consider the massive schwinger model as an example . in the next section",
    ", we review the perturbative tamm - dancoff transformation@xcite and apply it to the massive schwinger model . in sec .  3",
    ", we obtain the self - consistent rpa bound state equation . in sec .  4 , we numerically solve the equation .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion and discussions .",
    "in order to make the bound state calculation tractable , it is necessary to make the hamiltonian more diagonal in particle number space . in a previous paper@xcite",
    ", we eliminate the particle - number - changing interactions perturbatively by a similarity transformation .",
    "although it was originally proposed to resolve the sector - dependent counterterm problem in lf tamm - dancoff approximation@xcite , it is also useful in the massive schwinger model , where no ultraviolet divergence occurs .    consider the hamiltonian @xmath1 of the form , @xmath2 where @xmath3 . the interaction @xmath4 does not change the particle number while @xmath5 does . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are to organize the perturbation theory .",
    "we will put @xmath8 at the end .",
    "we eliminate the particle - number - changing interaction perturbatively by the following similarity transformation , @xmath9 so that @xmath10 is required to be diagonal in particle number .",
    "the operator @xmath11 is expanded in a power series of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , @xmath12    to the second order in @xmath7 , we obtain the following effective hamiltonian , @xmath13    although this effective hamiltonian is rather simple , it however gets very complicated beyond the second - order in perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , it is perturbative by construction and we do not have enough control over non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "for example , we do not know how to treat the non - perturbative divergences which occur in the diagonalization , except for the resummation by the use of the running coupling constant .    in the case of the massive schwinger model ,",
    "however , there are no ultraviolet divergences and , as is seen in the next section , we can generalize these interactions ( at least partially ) to include some non - perturbative effects .",
    "for the massive schwinger model , the effective interactions @xmath14 in the @xmath0 sector may be diagrammatically represented in fig .  [ effint ] .",
    "among these effective interactions , we are particularly interested in the coulomb interaction with vacuum polarization being included . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we showed that the vacuum polarization effects are very important in low - energy physics .",
    "it is therefore natural to include this effect ( i.e. , charge shielding ) in the bound state calculations .",
    "note that this approximation is essentially equivalent to the so - called random phase approximation ( rpa ) in many - body problems . here ,",
    "however , we do a bit further . as we did in ref.@xcite , we replace the vacuum polarization with an approximate complete set of meson states .",
    "a simple calculation gives the following replacement , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the wave function of the @xmath18-th `` meson '' with mass @xmath19 .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for the convention . )",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are longitudinal momenta of the incoming ( outgoing ) fermion and antifermion respectively .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ eff_coulomb ] .",
    "note that we have summed the geometric series of the vacuum polarization@xcite .    with this replacement ,",
    "we obtain the following bound state equation ( in units of @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the screening factor .",
    "( [ new ] ) is our extension of the t  hooft - bergknoff equation@xcite , @xmath27    some remarks are in order :    1 .",
    "the screening factor @xmath28 depends not only on the momentum transfer @xmath29 but on the individual momenta of the fermion and the antifermion . the @xmath30-dependent terms do not scale in a simple way .",
    "it makes the analysis of this equation very complicated .",
    "2 .   the equation ( [ new ] ) is a self - consistent one , so that we should solve it iteratively as we do in the next section .",
    "it is important to note that , although we started with the two - body bound state equation ( [ old ] ) , our bound state equation ( [ new ] ) contains the effects of _ infinitely _ many fock states because of this self - consistency .",
    "3 .   although the equation ( [ new ] ) is a self - consistent one , it is not the usual hartree - fock approximation in which only the wave function of the specific state is included .",
    "our equation requires the information on _ all _ the `` meson '' states .",
    "it is not the usual rpa either , in which only the perturbative vacuum polarization diagrams ( rings ) are summed and the self - consistency is not required .",
    "4 .   @xmath31 .",
    "of course it physically means that the electric charge is screened due to the vacuum polarization .",
    "the effective charge reduces in a momentum dependent way .",
    "the screening factor is included not only for the usual coulomb term but also the so - called `` self - induced inertia '' term , @xmath32 this is necessary in order to ensure the positivity of the eigenvalue @xmath33 . by multiplying @xmath34 and integrating over @xmath30 from @xmath35 to @xmath36",
    ", we obtain @xmath37 since the screening factor @xmath28 is positive , the eigenvalue @xmath33 must be positive .",
    "if we did not include the screening factor in the self - induced inertia term , we would not have had the positivity of @xmath33 .",
    "6 .   in the zero - momentum - transfer limit @xmath38 , the screening factor becomes momentum independent , i.e. , @xmath39 the factor @xmath40 is the one we encountered in ref.@xcite .",
    "the wave function @xmath41 for the t  hooft - bergknoff equation ( [ old ] ) has a definite meaning that it is the two - body amplitude with respect to the free fermion and antifermion .",
    "the wave function @xmath41 for our equation ( [ new ] ) does not have such a clear meaning because it contains the contribution from the higher fock states .",
    "roughly speaking , however , it could be considered as the two - body amplitude with respect to the dressed ( constituent ) fermion and antifermion .",
    "in this section , we numerically solve our bound state equation ( [ new ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , however , we are unable to find a useful set of basis functions@xcite which enable us to calculate the hamiltonian matrix elements analytically .",
    "instead , we use a naive discretization of the equation .",
    "we do not claim that the numerical results we present in this section is accurate .",
    "rather we emphasize that our equation gives a reasonably small correction to the corresponding solution of the t  hooft - bergknoff equation and therefore our equation could be a starting point of further improvements .",
    "the method is extremely simple .",
    "we discretize the range of @xmath30 , @xmath42 $ ] , into @xmath43 pieces , and impose the boundary condition on the wave function , @xmath44 .",
    "thus our equation becomes an @xmath45 matrix eigenvalue equation .",
    "we first solve it with @xmath46 , and then use the result to calculate the screening factor for the next calculation . in this way , we iteratively solve the equation until the solution becomes self - consistent .",
    "most of the calculations were done with @xmath47 .",
    "we stop the iteration when the difference of the subsequent wavefunctions becomes less than @xmath48 , @xmath49 a typical number of iterations is 4 . in general , the convergence is slower for smaller fermion masses .    first we compare the results with those without vacuum polarization .",
    "[ deviation ] shows how the meson mass calculated iteratively with the new bound state equation deviates from the one obtained with the t  hooft - bergknoff equation .",
    "we see that there is systematic improvement , which is almost independent of how fine the equations are discretized . for small fermion masses",
    "@xmath50 , because of the singular behavior of the wavefunction at the edges , even the result without vacuum polarization depends on @xmath51 , and therefore the results there should not be trusted . see fig .",
    "[ limitation ] for the copmarison with the result obtained by the basis function method@xcite which is accurate for small fermion masses .",
    "we however emphasize that the modification due to vacuum polarization does not ruin the spectrum but leads to a reasonable correction .",
    "this is not so trivial because the modification is essentially nonlinear and depends all the eigenvalues as well as the eigenstates .",
    "this , together with the valence dominance in lf massive schwinger model@xcite , gives a consistent picture that the modification with vacuum polarization correctly reflects the ( small ) effects of higher fock states .",
    "next we compare the wavefunctions . as seen in fig .",
    "[ comparewf ] , the meson wavefunction for the new equation is less singular at the edges ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "as we emphasized earlier@xcite , apparently we should not sum up the geometrical series of vacuum polarization .",
    "here we did it as a regularization .",
    "in the calculations without summing up the geometrical series , we numerically found that a state whose wavefunction is _ odd _ under @xmath54 becomes the lightest one when the fermion mass is small .",
    "this seems to be because @xmath55 becomes very small when @xmath56 .",
    "we are unable to give any positive interpretation of such a lightest state with wavefunction being odd under @xmath54 , and thus think that it is an artefact . in fact , the odd lightest state occurs for @xmath57 , where the results should not be trusted because , as we remarked earlier , the discretization can not represent the correct endpoint behavior of the wave function , which is very important for the correct spectrum .",
    "we emphasized that the new bound state equation contains the information on all the `` meson '' states .",
    "it is however dominated by the lowest meson state and effectively reduces to a much simpler one .",
    "namely , we numerically find that the sum in the screening factor ( [ screeningfactor ] ) is strongly dominated by the first term .",
    "this fact reduces the cpu time considerably . in table",
    "[ comparison ] , we compare the reduced calculation with the full one .",
    "in this paper , we developed a self - consistent rpa as a new effective hamiltonian method in lfft .",
    "the method was applied to the massive schwinger model and a generalization of the t  hooft - bergknoff equation was obtained , which effectively includes the contributions from _ infinitely _ many fock states .",
    "we numerically solved it and found that the modification , i.e. , the inclusion of vacuum polarization , leads to reasonable small corrections .",
    "we hope that this new bound state equation becomes a starting point of more elaborate approximations .",
    "it has been shown that the first - oder coefficient @xmath58 of the expansion of the meson mass squared in terms of the fermion mass , @xmath59 can not be improved even if the variational space is systematically extended@xcite .",
    "later , dalley suggested that the endpoint behavior of the wave function may change if the effects of higher fock states correctly .",
    "( it has been assumed that the endpoint behavior is solely determined by the two - body sector@xcite . )",
    "because the coefficient is closely related to the endpoint behavior , it is hoped that the so - called `` 2% discrepancy '' will disappear when the correct endpoint behavior is taken into account .",
    "since our new bound state equation contains the effects of higher fock states , it is natural to ask if the dalley s suggestion is correct quantitatively . for small fermion masses , it looks legitimate to approximate the screening factor in the following way , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the meson mass and @xmath62 , and the bound state equation becomes @xmath63 we estimate the coefficient @xmath58 by using the ansatz @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and find that @xmath66 which should be compared with the value for the t  hooft - bergknoff equation , @xmath67 and the ` correct ' value , @xmath68 . although it is considerably too small , it is important that it shifts from the value of the t  hooft - bergknoff equation .",
    "it is conceivable that the approximation employed here is too naive and a more elaborate calculation would give a much better value .",
    "in fact , the above approximation ( the limit ( [ slimit ] ) ) is not legitimate , because for finite @xmath69 , however tiny , the term with the fermion mass is not negligible for @xmath70 . at present",
    ", we are unable to extract any useful information on the endpoint behavior because of this subtlety . the numerical results in the previous section may suggest that the effects of higher fock states would solve the 2% discrepancy , though the present numerical method is too crude to correctly calculate the meson mass in the small fermion mass region .    although we included the effects of vacuum polarization as an effective interaction , from the similarity transformation point of view",
    ", there are other kind of effective interactions . to ensure the invariance of the eigenvalues ( `` meson '' masses ) under the addition of effective interactions , it is necessary for the transformation to be unitary .",
    "that is , we have to add other interactions in fig",
    ".  [ effint ] too . in this paper",
    ", we assumed that the effects of the other interactions are small .",
    "but this is a cheat : the self - energy diagram with vacuum polarization is infrared divergent .",
    "presumably , such infrared divergences cancel in the calculation of the meson spectrum .",
    "( some authors also assumed the cancellation@xcite . )",
    "we are however unable to pin point how such cancellation occurs .",
    "note that the cancellation of infrared divergences would be different from that in scattering processes . in qed , for example , because positronium is a neutral particle and has a finite size , it can not couple to very soft photons , which play an important role in the cancellation of infrared divergences in scattering processes .      1 .",
    "it is of course interesting to extend the present formulation to realistic four - dimensional models .",
    "we are now working on this direction .",
    "2 .   it is interesting to note again that the new equation is a self - consistent one from the spontaneous - symmetry - breaking point of view .",
    "we hope that a similar setting would leads to a useful framework for the vacuum problem in lfft .",
    "the vacuum polarization inside the meson is also important in the presence of theta .",
    "it solves several puzzles concerning theta .",
    "the work is now in progress .",
