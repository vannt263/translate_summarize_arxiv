    "the lower - mass stars of the main - sequence of the hertzsprung - russell diagram are known as m - dwarfs .",
    "they constitute the majority of stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "they are intrinsically faint since they are cooler and smaller than the other stars . because of",
    "their faintness photometric and spectroscopic observations could be obtained for a limited number m - dwarfs .",
    "@xcite suggests that at least 70 per cent of all stars in the sphere with a radius of 10 pc about the sun are m - dwarfs .",
    "therefore , detailed studies of these faint but numerous low - mass stars are critical importance to evaluate a model of the galactic evolution and present status . moreover the m - dwarfs are particularly needed in the understanding of evolution of main - sequence stars towards the lower - mass regime .",
    "the evolutionary calculations of low - mass stars allow us to define not only the transition from partly to fully convection but also to define a limit between stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite around spectral type m3.5 stars become fully convective and thus the dynamo mechanism must be different in cooler stars because they do not posses tachocline layer with strong differential rotation .",
    "however , @xcite have concluded from the measurements of stokes parameter about tens of stars spanning the whole m - dwarfs that no significant change in the average magnetic field strengths occurs when stars become fully convective .",
    "later on @xcite could reveal the rotation- magnetic field relation in which magnetic field strengths increase towards short rotation periods .",
    "low - mass m - dwarfs are generally faint objects because of their small radii and low temperatures . due to their faintness the m - dwarfs",
    "have limited the number of high - resolution , high signal - to - noise spectroscopic studies .",
    "in addition , the optical spectrum of these cool stars is mostly covered by molecular bands which hide and blend the atomic lines used in spectral analysis .",
    "these dominant molecular bands make it difficult to measure the atomic line strengths which are needed for metallicity determination .",
    "the physical parameters , such as mass , radius and luminosity as well as age and rotational period could only be derived if a m - dwarf is a member of a close binary or a multiple system . in a binary or a multiple system",
    "the components are most likely coeval and their spin axes are perpendicular to the orbital plane",
    ".    numerous photometric observations of binary stars were recently gathered by the surveys of like the t@xmath0es@xcite , nsvs@xcite , superwasp@xcite , kepler@xcite , etc . despite the main aim of these surveys is to search gamma - ray bursters , and especially extra - solar planetary transits many binary systems are discovered and light curves of many systems could be obtained .",
    "therefore , the tremendous photometric datasets containing unknown or little known binary systems are presented for the use of astronomers .",
    "light variability of t - cyg1 - 01385 was announced by @xcite and @xcite in the list of 773 eclipsing binaries found in the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey .",
    "it was classified as an `` ambiguous '' binary in their list .",
    "mass and radius of the components were estimated for the first time by @xcite combining the spectroscopic orbital elements obtained from the primary star s radial velocities with a high - precision transit light curve obtained by the keplercam .",
    "the results obtained up - to - date point out that the fainter component of t - cyg1 - 01385 is so close to the fully convective m - dwarfs .",
    "therefore we planned new spectroscopic observations of the system to refine the masses , radii and effective temperatures of both stars .",
    ".catalog information for t - cyg1 - 01385 . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is no measured trigonometric parallax available for the system . from the b- and v - passband measurements of tycho and",
    "the jhk magnitudes given in the 2mass catalog we estimated an interstellar reddening of @xmath4 mag .",
    "then we estimated an average distance to the system as 355@xmath27 pc .",
    "using the radii and effective temperatures we computed the luminosities of the components as @xmath5 = 5.4 @xmath2 0.4l @xmath6 and @xmath7 = 0.009 @xmath2 0.002l @xmath6 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "in fig.5 we compare the positions of the stars in the @xmath8 diagram .",
    "the isochrones for 5 , 6 , and 7 gyr obtained by @xmath9 models ( @xcite , @xcite ) for z=0.004 are also plotted .",
    "the primary star appears to an evolved f - star with an age of about 6 gyr .",
    "this comparison with the theoretical models indicates that the primary star should have poor metal abundance .",
    "models for z=0.004 . for comparison the evolutionary tracks for 1 and 1.1m@xmath6 and isochrones for 5 , 6 and 7 gyr are shown .",
    ", width=529 ]    for the first time @xcite and @xcite called attention about the significant difference of low - mass stars radii between measured and predicted by the theory . his comparison for a limited stars with masses and radii determined with an accuracy better than 3 percent revealed that the observed radii are systematically larger than those estimated by theoretical models . in contrary ,",
    "their effective temperatures are significantly cooler than in the models .",
    "later on , @xcite collected the available masses , radii and effective temperatures of the low - mass stars obtained up to at that date and compared with those calculated by the stellar evolution models .",
    "they have also compared radii and effective temperatures of 21 low - mass stars in the mass - radius and mass - effective temperature diagrams .",
    "they conclude that stars below 0.3 m@xmath6 have radii and effective temperatures which are consistent with those of models .",
    "however , larger mass stars , above 0.3 m@xmath6 , begin to deviate from the theoretical predictions in the @xmath10 diagram .",
    "the observed radii are significantly larger than that of models . in contrary ,",
    "their observed effective temperatures are significantly lower than those models , i.e. they appear as below - shifted from the theoretical @xmath11 relation .",
    "the discrepancies in radii and effective temperatures could neither be explained by changing the ratio of mixing - length to pressure scale height nor metallicity @xcite . as an alternative explanation",
    "the magnetic activity , which is responsible for the observed larger radii but cooler effective temperatures , was adopted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "due to high magnetic activity in fast - rotating dwarfs , because of spin - orbit synchronization , their surfaces are covered by dark spots .",
    "faster rotation enhances solar - type activity which results in larger radius and lower effective temperature .",
    "fig.6 shows locations of the low - mass stars in the in @xmath10 and @xmath11 planes .",
    "the low - mass companion of t - cyg1 - 01385 appears to have a radius about 26 per cent larger and effective temperature about 18 per cent cooler than the models @xcite . in a very recent paper @xcite called attention to the stars having masses about 0.34 m@xmath6",
    "the empirical @xmath10 diagram shows that the stars with masses lower than about 0.3 m@xmath6 do not deviate from that predicted by the models .",
    "however , largest deviations both in @xmath10 and @xmath11 occur just at the mass higher than 0.34 m@xmath6 .",
    "this mass may be taken as transition from partly convective atmospheres to the fully convective stars .",
    "spectroscopic observations of t - cyg1 - 01385 are obtained and the radial velocity curves of both components are revealed for the first time .",
    "analysis of the radial velocities and the t@xmath0es at the @xmath12-passband and the @xmath13cam at the z - passband light curves yielded the physical parameters of the components .",
    "our analysis indicates that the eclipsing binary consists of an f8 subgiant and an m4 dwarf . *",
    "the radius of the less massive m - dwarf is larger about 26 percent but the effective temperature 18 percent cooler than those estimated from the models . *",
    "the radii and effective temperatures of low - mass stars obtained so far have been compared with each other and also with the models both in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 panels . *",
    "the less massive secondary star with a mass of 0.34m@xmath6 appears to be just in the boundary between partially convection and fully convection . *",
