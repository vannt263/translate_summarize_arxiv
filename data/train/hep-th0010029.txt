    "the aim of the paper is twofold .",
    "first we construct covariant wick - type star - product within the framework of the fedosov deformation quantization @xcite .",
    "second we propose a canonical superextension of the construction along the lines of the bordemann approach @xcite and present a wick - type deformation for the exterior algebra of the base even manifold .",
    "the first step is motivated by a wide physical application of the wick - type star - product especially for the models with the infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "the second one is motivated by noncommutative field theory @xcite on a curved manifold , where the covariant definition is required for the deformed product between the _",
    "tensor observables_. we also hope that recently found relationship between the fedosov deformation and brst theory @xcite , being combined to the wick type symbol technique , should pave the way to studying anomalies in a wide class of the filed theory problems making use of the deformation quantisation tools .",
    "under the term `` wick - type '' we understand a broad class of symbols incorporating , along with the ordinary ( genuine ) wick symbols , the so - called @xmath0-symbols as well as various mixed possibilities commonly regarded as the pseudo - wick symbols . to give a more precise definition of what is meant here consider first the linear symplectic manifold @xmath1 equipped with the canonical poisson brackets @xmath2 .",
    "then the usual weyl - moyal product of two observables , defined as @xmath3 turns the space of smooth functions in @xmath4 to the non - commutative associative algebra with unit called the algebra of weyl symbols .",
    "the transition from the weyl to wick - type symbols is achieved by adding a certain complex - valued symmetric tensor @xmath5 to the poisson one @xmath6 in the formula for the weyl - moyal @xmath7product , @xmath8 @xmath9 although the associativity of the modified product holds for any constant @xmath5 the wick type symbols are extracted by the additional half - rank condition @xmath10 . in particular",
    ", the genuine wick symbol corresponds to a pure imaginary @xmath5 while the real @xmath11 is associated with @xmath0-symbol . in the general case one",
    "can easily show that the dual complexified phase space @xmath12 is splitted into a direct sum of two transverse lagrangean subspaces , which are left and right kernel subspaces for the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "turning to the curved manifold @xmath14 we just replace the constant matrix @xmath15 by a general complex - valued bilinear form @xmath16 with the antisymmetrical part being the non - degenerate poisson tensor . then the wick - type star - product is defined to satisfy the following `` boundary condition '' @xmath17 @xmath18 being the formal deformation parameter ( `` plank constant '' ) , and dots mean the terms of higher orders in @xmath19 as in a general case of the symplectic manifold the condition ( [ bound ] ) is compatible with so - called the _ correspondence principle _ of quantum mechanics : @xmath20 where @xmath21 means the poisson bracket associated to @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out that if there exists a torsion - free linear connection @xmath23 preserving @xmath13 the star - product satisfying the condition ( [ bound ] ) can be achieved by a minimal modification of the fedosov method .",
    "namely , if we replace the @xmath24-multiplication in the weyl algebra bundle @xcite by the that of the wick type ( [ wlp ] ) all the steps and the theorems of the fedosov method is generalized in a straightforward manner and thus we get the star - product of the wick type .",
    "the only crucial point of this program is the existence of a torsion - free linear connection @xmath25 preserving @xmath11 .",
    "one may readily find that the necessary and sufficient condition for such a connection to exist is the integrability of the right and left kernel distribution of @xmath26 when the latter condition is fulfilled @xmath25 is just the levi - civita connection associated to the symmetric and non - degenerate form @xmath27 and the right and left kernel distributions define the transverse polarizations of the symplectic manifold @xmath28 .",
    "thus we see that the symplectic manifold admitting the wick - type star - product are necessarily equipped with the pair of the transverse polarizations .",
    "after the paper @xcite , the symplectic manifold equipped by a torsion - free symplectic connection is usually called as fedosov manifold because precisely these data  symplectic structure and connection  enter to fedosov s star - product .",
    "the wick deformation quantization ( as we have defined ) involves one more geometric structure - a pair of transverse polarizations , and , by analogy to the previous case , the underlying manifold may be called as the _ fedosov manifolds of wick type _ or _ fw - manifold for short_. the extended list of examples of the fw - manifolds is provided by the khler manifolds .",
    "it is the case when the matrix of the tensor @xmath13 is the anti - hermitian in local real coordinates .",
    "there are also examples of the fw - manifolds having no khler structure but assigned instead by two real transverse polarizations .",
    "the last situation is strikingly illustrated by the one - sheet hyperboloid embedded into three dimensional minkowski space as the surface @xmath29 @xmath30 being linear coordinates in @xmath31 .",
    "one ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the integral leaves of the corresponding real polarizations coincide here with two transverse sets of linear generatings of hyperboloid s surface being , in turn , the isotropic geodesics of the respective metric structure .    at present",
    "there is a large amount of literature concerning the deformation quantization on polarized symplectic manifolds ( see i.g . @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and references therein ) beginning with the pioneering paper by berezin @xcite on the quantization in complex symmetric spaces .",
    "however , in all the papers cited above the very definition and the construction of the wick - type star - product are based on the explicit use of local coordinates adapted to the polarization ( or _ separation of variables _ in terminology of work @xcite ) .",
    "now we present construction of the double dimensional superextension of the fw - manifold @xmath14 and perform its deformation quantization .",
    "we construct the supermanifold supplying the initial fw - manifold by additional odd variables @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the index of the tangent space .",
    "then the formal series    @xmath35    where the coefficients @xmath36 are antisymmetric with respect to the index permutations are thought to be superfunctions constituting a supercommutative superalgebra , which we will denote by @xmath37 .",
    "as it follows from the results by bordemann @xcite the grassmann multiplication in @xmath37 can be formally deformed into associative @xmath38-graded multiplication @xmath39 on @xmath40 $ ] whenever the symplectic and the metric structures are given on the base even manifold",
    ". the remarkable feature of this construction is that the deformation quantization for the algebra of super functions is performed first and the super poisson bracket arises here _ a posteriori _ as @xmath18-linear term of the supercommutator .",
    "here we modify bordemann s approach to the quantization of the supermanifold @xcite and present the deformation quantization of the wick type for the superextension of the fw - manifold .",
    "since the basic steps of our construction are essentially similar to those in the original papers by fedosov @xcite and bordemann @xcite we consider them very briefly dwelling only upon peculiarities .",
    "first we define a superextension of the weyl algebra bundle @xmath41 , introduced in @xcite .",

    "note that we omit the sign @xmath52 between the differentials regarding @xmath53 and @xmath54 as the set of @xmath55 anti - commuting variables : @xmath56 hence , @xmath57 is also @xmath58-graded algebra with respect to the grassmann parity @xmath59 ( [ sect ] ) and the supercommutator of two homogeneous elements @xmath60 with the parities @xmath61and @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63=a\\circ b-(-1)^{q_1q_2}b\\circ a\\ ] ] let us introduce the nilpotent operator @xmath64 which will be rather important in formulating the respective analogues of the fedosov equation .",
    "it is easily seen to be the inner superderivation of the superalgebra @xmath57 .",

    "in this paper we have realized the wick - type star - product following to the fedosov approach to the deformation quantization .",
    "we have observed that the most natural geometrical framework for this star - product is the so - called fedosov manifold of wick type .",
    "this is defined as the real symplectic manifold equipped with a complex - valued half - rank bilinear form @xmath11 preserved by some torsion - free connection and it is shown to be necessarily the manifold admitting two transverse polarizations .",
    "we have shown that any fw - manifold can be canonically extended to the doubled dimensional supersymplectic manifold associated to the tangent bundle of the initial manifold . moreover",
    ", the latter can be easily then quantized along the line of the fedosov approach and this quantization procedure , yields the natural definition of the deformed product between antisymmetrical covariant tensors on the base even manifold .",
    "the latter is due to the natural one - to - one correspondence between the elements of the exterior algebra and the superfunctions ( [ sfunc ] ) of the introduced supermanifold .",
    "this correspondence can be easily restored by its definition on the monomial elements of the exterior algebra @xmath102    we hope that this deformed associative product may find its application in the noncommutative field theory in particular for constructing the noncommutative yang - mills theory @xcite on the curved symplectic manifolds .",
    "the problem of realizing the noncommutative yang - mills theory on a curved manifold is firstly posed in the paper by connes , douglas and schwarz @xcite and at first sight it seems to have a natural solution in the context of the deformation quantization .",
    "however the deformation quantization poses the problem of constructing the deformed algebra of scalar functions on the symplectic manifold .",
    "hence it is insufficient for constructing the noncommutative yang - mills theory , which should describe the dynamics of tensor fields as well .",
    "thus one firstly has to realize the star - product between tensor observables on the symplectic manifold . the star - product in addition",
    "should be defined in a generally covariant way since otherwise it would be impossible to present the invariant action for the theory in question .",
    "the quantization of the supermanifold presented above suggests a possible solution for the problem as it yields the definition for the covariant deformation of the exterior algebra on the initial even manifold .",
    "however the deformed algebra of the forms can not be restricted for example to the set of the 1-forms only thus a hypothetical noncommutative yang - mills theory would describe the dynamics of the forms of all the possible ranks .",
    "another ingredient which is important for constructing the action for the noncommutative yang - mills theory is the metric structure .",
    "this structure , in turn , being naively inserted into the action functional may violate the gauge invariance of the theory even in the case of the ordinary weyl - moyal star - product .",
    "thus the metric and symplectic structures should be considered on equal foot just like in the construction of the wick - type star - product .",
    "finally the construction of the gauge invariant action requires the definition of the trace measure for the aforementioned superalgebra .",
    "we will consider this problem elsewhere .",
