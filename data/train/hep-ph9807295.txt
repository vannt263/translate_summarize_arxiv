    "baryon masses have been studied intensively in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the results obtained in the standard approach using dimensional regularization to control the divergences in the theory are not completely satisfactory @xcite .",
    "the chiral loop corrections evaluated in that regularization scheme are very large , even of the order of the leading terms , and the convergence of the chiral expansion is at best very slow @xcite .",
    "in addition , the results are dominated by the contributions from heavy mesons , while pion loops would be expected to give the similar contributions in the range of distances or momenta in which the calculations are supposed to be reliable .",
    "the same difficulties appear in other situations , for example , in the calculation of the baryon magnetic moments in chiral perturbation theory @xcite , where the convergence and usefulness of the chiral expansion is again questionable @xcite .",
    "these shortcomings are due physically to the treatment of the hadrons as point particles in the standard approach .",
    "loop integrals then involve high momenta and unphysical short - distance contributions , and tend to be large and dominated by heavy mesons when calculated using dimensional regularization .",
    "the extension of chpt to higher orders also requires the introduction of new couplings in the effective field theory , and the theory loses its predictive power .    in this work , we reexamine the calculation of the baryon masses using a loop expansion rather than an expansion in powers of the chiral parameters .",
    "our approach is motivated by the remarkable success of a loop expansion for the baryon magnetic moments which starts from a qcd - based quark model @xcite .",
    "that model was derived in a quenched approximation to qcd following the wilson - loop method of brambilla _ et al .",
    "the inclusion of loop corrections was necessary to remove the quenching .",
    "the baryon hamiltonian obtained by brambilla _",
    "et al . _ has been used to fit the baryon spectra with reasonable accuracy @xcite , but again in the quenched approximation .",
    "we concentrate here on the calculation of the one - loop corrections to the masses in the ground - state baryon octet and decuplet . as in our earlier work on the moment problem @xcite",
    ", we use chiral couplings for the low momentum interactions of the mesons and baryons , but treat those hadrons as composite .",
    "in particular , because of their extended structure , the baryons and mesons can not absorb high recoil momenta and remain in the same state , so that high - momentum or short - distance effects are suppressed naturally by wave function effects .",
    "we model these by introducing a form factor at the baryon - meson vertex as in @xcite .",
    "the divergences associated with point baryons are eliminated in this approach , and the residual loop corrections are reduced in magnitude and have similar magnitudes for pion , kaon , and eta loops .",
    "we include the decuplet baryon states explicitly in our calculations as was done in @xcite and in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "we find that the contributions of octet and decuplet intermediate states are of comparable importance for either the octet or decuplet masses .",
    "this would be expected in a qm picture , since the octet and decuplet baryons differ only in their spin structure .",
    "we note also that the octet - decuplet mass splitting is small on the scale of the relevant loop momenta , so an expansion of the decuplet contributions in powers of the loop momentum over the mass splitting as in some approaches to chpt is poorly convergent even when the calculation is restricted to the octet masses .",
    "the results of our calculation are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "the loop corrections are typically about 35 percent of the leading mass term , suggesting that the loop expansion converges reasonably well .",
    "moreover , the structure of the corrections is such that they can largely be absorbed by adjustments of the input parameters , leaving residual corrections to the baryon masses of less than 10 mev .",
    "if we fit the octet and decuplet masses simultaneously using the five parameters that appear in the theory at tree level and the su(6 ) couplings used in our earlier work , we reproduce the average masses of the eight octet and decuplet baryon multiplets with an average deviation of only @xmath0 mev . this is to be compared with the average deviation of @xmath1 mev in a fit without loop corrections .",
    "if we fix one of the parameters using a lowest order qm relation , the average deviation increases to 4.0 mev , to be compared with a deviation of 4.4 mev in a corresponding fit without loop corrections .",
    "the real improvement in the results becomes clear when we analyze the structure of the loop corrections and the violations of the mass relations that hold at tree level .",
    "the parts of the loop corrections that can not be described within the tree - level structure are small , but largely account for the violations of the mass sum rules .",
    "an approach to loop corrections similar to that used here and in our earlier work @xcite was recently introduced by donoghue and holstein @xcite and donoghue , holstein , and borasoy @xcite in the context of chpt .",
    "those authors show that the difficulties with dimensional regularization in chpt arise from unwanted short - distance effects .",
    "they propose to eliminate those effects by the use of a chiral cutoff in momentum space , while we have introduced the cutoff as resulting physically from the composite structure of the baryons @xcite .",
    "their analysis shows that the effects of uncertainty in the cutoff can largely be absorbed in a redefinition of the input parameters such as occurs in our fitting procedure .",
    "however , they do not include the baryon decuplet contributions in their discussions of baryon masses and moments .",
    "heavy baryon perturbation theory ( hbpt ) was developed in @xcite and extended to the chiral context in @xcite .",
    "it has been used to study a number of hadronic processes at momentum transfers much less than a typical baryon mass .",
    "the key ideas in hbpt involve the replacement of the momentum @xmath2 of a nearly on - shell baryon by its on - shell momentum @xmath3 plus a small additional momentum @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the replacement of the baryon field operator @xmath6 by an velocity - dependent operator @xmath7 constructed to remove the free momentum dependence in the dirac equation , @xmath8 @xcite . in these expressions @xmath9",

    "velocity - dependent rarita - schwinger decuplet fields @xmath12 are defined in the same manner , with @xmath13 .",
    "note that we only extract the large octet - baryon mass @xmath9 in this construction to avoid the appearance of phase factors in the octet - decuplet interactions defined below , and will treat the small decuplet - octet mass difference @xmath14 explicitly .",
    "the velocity - dependent perturbation expansion involves modified feynman rules and an expansion in powers of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "because the low - momentum couplings of mesons to baryons appear to be well described as derivative couplings with the standard chiral structure , we will use those couplings in our analysis .",
    "however , we emphasize that we will be making a loop expansion for the masses rather than the expansion in powers of the momentum and the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath16 characteristic of chpt .",
    "higher - order effective couplings of chpt will be implicit output of our dynamical calculation .",
    "the lagrangian for the modified baryon fields depends on the usual matrix of baryon fields , with @xmath17 replaced by @xmath18 , and on the pseudoscalar pion octet normalized as @xmath19 this couples to the baryon fields at low momenta through the vector and axial vector currents defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 mev is the meson decay constant .",

    "it is straightforward to show that the structure at this level encompasses that in the @xmath44 quark model taken to first order in @xmath16 , but the qm provides an extra first - order constraint @xmath45 which connects the octet and decuplet masses . and use of the feynman - hellman theorem @xcite gives first - order perturbations of the baryon masses with precisely the structure given in eq.([eq : l^m ] ) , but with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 expressed in terms of specific matrix elements .",

    "the momentum scale in the loop integrations is set primarily by the parameter @xmath53 , and the integrals are dominated by intermediate - range contributions .",

    "this suggests that the loop corrections have approximately the tree - level structure , and can be parametrized up to small residual contributions @xmath122 using the tree - level mass relations with five parameters analogous to those above .",
    "we note that the total loop corrections introduce no new symmetry breaking when the meson masses in the loops are taken as equal .",
    "the parts of the individual loop contributions that do not have the tree - level structure therefore cancel , and the total corrections can be absorbed completely by a readjustment of the tree - level parameters . while this is no longer possible for @xmath123 , the effect of unequal masses on the loop integrals is suppressed because of the form factors as discussed above .",

    "<S> we show that the average multiplet masses in the baryon octet and decuplet can be fitted with an average error of only @xmath0 mev in a meson loop expansion with chiral su(6 ) couplings , with the hadrons treated as composite particles using a baryon - meson form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the form factor suppresses unphysical short distance effects and leads to a controllable expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we find , in contrast to the results of standard chiral perturbation theory , that pion loops are as important as kaon or eta loops as would be expected when only intermediate- and long - distance contributions are retained . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the contributions of decuplet intermediate states are important in the calculation of the masses , and those states must be included explicitly in a consistent theory . </S>",
    "<S> these results agree with those of our recent loop - expansion analysis of the baryon magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> we show , finally , that the parts of the loop contributions that change the tree - level structure of the baryon masses are small , but largely account for the violations of the baryon mass sum rules which hold at tree level . </S>"
