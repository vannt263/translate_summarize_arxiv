    "figure [ figure12 ] depicts isothermal in- and out - of plane magnetoresistance measurements at @xmath60  k for different hydrostatic pressures up to @xmath19  kbar ( room temperature pressure values ) . a clear anisotropic behavior becomes visible , as the out - of - plane field induces a purely positive slope of the resistivity curve , while the in - plane magnetic field first reduces the resistance considerably up to a critical field @xmath105 ( right panel , black arrows ) , where the slope changes its sign and finally a positive magnetoresistance settles at high fields . also in the out - of - plane data , a critical field @xmath106 ( left panel , black arrow ) can be identified as a clear kink with @xmath107 .",
    "rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  at different hydrostatic pressures up to @xmath19  kbar ( room temperature pressure values ) . while for the out - of - plane configuration a purely positive slope can be observed , the in - plane measurements exhibit a negative slope at low fields , connected with the field induced enhancement of @xmath8 .",
    "two critical fields manifest themselves in the data ( a ) as a minimum in the in - plane configuration at @xmath108  kg and ( b ) as a kink in the out - of - plane measurement at @xmath109  kg ( see the black arrows ) . ]",
    "the underlying physical processes that lead to the big changes in resistivity at the critical fields can be identified by comparing the critical fields with the temperature dependent magnetoresistance measurements at ambient pressure , as well as the magnetization measurements .",
    "the in plane - critical field of around @xmath108  kg at @xmath110  kbar coincides with the suppression of the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature , as can be seen best in the upper phase diagram of figure [ figure8 ] .",
    "moreover , the shift of @xmath105 to slightly higher fields with pressure ( @xmath111 kg at @xmath19  kbar ) reflects the enhancement of @xmath18 by pressure .",
    "thus this behavior shows clearly the relationship of negative magnetoresistance and the enhancement of @xmath8 with the magnetic ordering in eu(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 . for the out - of - plane measurements , the critical field @xmath109  kg corresponds to the onset of the magnetic saturation , as can be concluded from the magnetization data of figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "the large positive magnetoresistance at intermediate fields - after the suppression or saturation of all internal magnetic effects - occurs in both cases due to paramagnetic and orbital pair - breaking effects induced by the external magnetic field , as expected for any normal superconductor without magnetic ordering phenomena . at high fields , a saturation of the magnetoresistance sets in as soon as the superconducting phase is completely destroyed .",
    "+ to get an idea about the origin of the up to now unidentified resistivity feature evolving at low pressures , magnetoresistance measurements were carried out in a temperature range from @xmath60  k up to @xmath112  k at a pressure of @xmath113  kbar , where the feature is especially pronounced .",
    "figure [ figure13 ] shows the resulting resistivity curves obtained with applied magnetic fields in - plane ( out - of - plane magnetic fields induce the same field dependence ) . as indicated by the black arrow ,",
    "magnetic fields lead to a broadening and suppression of the resistivity hump .",
    "therefore , this feature is probably of magnetic nature .",
    "+ in principle , there are two possible scenarios to explain the origin of this feature : the kondo effect and the spin density wave .",
    "as the feature appears at low pressures already at high temperatures and shows a very similar curvature compared to the typical sdw in pressurized eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite and doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite , we suggest that external pressure re - activates the sdw in eu(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "this view is supported by the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] ) revealing a suppression of @xmath8 in the same pressure range , indicating the well known competition of the two phases in the iron pnictide family . with regard to the general phase diagram of the eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 parent compound ,",
    "the re - activation can be caused by a competition between the effects of the applied external pressure and the electron doping which comes , in case of rh , along with a negative internal pressure effect @xcite . by taken into account that not just doping and the unit cell volume are parameters to tune the high-@xmath11 superconductivity and magnetic phases in layered iron pnictides , but also peculiarities of the crystal structure , like the tetrahedral angel play a crucial role @xcite , the combination of internal and external pressure can lead to configurations not accessible by just one tuning - parameter .",
    "kbar show the evolution of the pressure induced cusp in @xmath42 at around @xmath53  k with in - plane magnetic fields .",
    "the local maximum gets broadened and shifts to higher temperatures till at fields of @xmath17  kg the upturn is no longer present in the resistivity curve . ]    as the compound seems to be close to fermi - surface nesting instabilities , small external pressure can counteract to the internal negative pre - pressure paving the way for the appearance of a sdw in the under - doped regime . to pin down this scenario ,",
    "further investigations are needed , preferably magnetic susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements under pressure would be a powerful tool .",
    "additionally further pressure dependent measurements on chemically substituted superconducting compounds with negative pre - pressure , such as eu(fe@xmath20ir@xmath21)@xmath2as@xmath2 or other members of the rh doped family , would be interesting to see , if significantly higher @xmath11 values can be reached in this way .",
    "high - pressure magneto - transport measurements up to @xmath19  kbar have been performed on eu(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  single crystals to establish a pressure - dependent phase diagram of an electron doped re - entrant superconducting member of the eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 iron - pnictide family .",
    "the systematic variation of the two parameters pressure and magnetic field provides thereby the possibility to vary individual aspects of the complex system to get an insight to the interesting interplay of superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "the achieved magnetic field depended phase diagram at ambient pressure reveals the validity of the picture of a canted a - type antiferromagnetic ordering which even leads to a field - induced enhancement of @xmath8 in the order of @xmath27  k. magnetization measurements additionally confirm the existence of a spin - glass phase and uncover the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity at low temperatures .",
    "thus , eu(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  can be count to the family of `` magnetic superconductors '' .",
    "the thermal hysteresis in @xmath42 around the superconducting transition was identified as a novel helpful tool to follow the magnetic and superconducting transition temperatures under applied magnetic fields .",
    "the pressure dependent measurements show a fast suppression of the superconducting state at a pressure around @xmath10  kbar where @xmath114 , opening the view on the direct competition between the two phenomena .",
    "by contrast to other iron - based superconductors  showing non - fermi liquid behavior above the superconducting dome connected with a hidden quantum critical point  we observe a @xmath29-linear development of the resistivity at the edge of the superconducting dome .",
    "furthermore , an additional magnetic field dependent feature develops in the intermediate pressure range . we identify it as a sdw reactivated by pressure , which counteracts the negative internal pressure induced by chemical substitution .",
    "this indicates once more that not only doping influences the phase diagram ; instead , small variations of the lattice by internal and external pressure plays an important role .",
    "moreover , we open with our experiments a novel path to manipulate and eventually enhance @xmath11 in compounds under negative internal pressure by additional external pressure .    we thank c. kamella for performing the exd measurements at the mpi in stuttgart , g. untereiner for preparing the crystals and d. v. efremov for fruitful discussions .",
