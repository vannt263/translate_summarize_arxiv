    "large - scale diagonalization is widely used in many areas of physics , from quantum chemistry@xcite to nuclear physics.@xcite it is also routinely used to obtain spectra of model quantum dots , see for example refs .  .",
    "the method is based on a projection of the model hamiltonian onto a finite - dimensional subspace of the many - body hilbert space in question , hence the method is an instance of the rayleigh - ritz method.@xcite usually , one takes the stance that the many - body hamiltonian is composed of two parts @xmath0 and @xmath1 , treating the latter as a perturbation of the former , whose eigenfunctions are assumed to be a basis for the hilbert space .",
    "this leads to a matrix diagonalization problem , hence the name of the method . as @xmath1 often contains the interaction terms of the model , `` perturbing '' the electronic configuration states of @xmath0 , the method",
    "is also called the configuration - interaction method . in the limit of an infinite basis , the method is _ in principle _ exact , and for this reason it is also called `` exact diagonalization '' .",
    "usually , however , this method is far from exact , as @xmath1 is rarely a small perturbation ( in a sense to be specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation - def ] ) while limited computing resources yield a tight bound on the number of degrees of freedom available per particle .    in this work",
    "we provide mathematical convergence criteria for configuration - interaction calculations .",
    "more specifically , we address this problem in the case where @xmath0 is a harmonic oscillator ( or h.o .  for short ) , concentrating on a simple one - dimensional problem .",
    "a common model for a quantum dot is indeed a perturbed harmonic oscillator , and using h.o .",
    "basis functions is also a common approach in other fields of many - body physics and partial differential equations settings in general , as it is also known as the hermite spectral method.@xcite when we in the following refer to the configuration - interaction method , or ci for short , it is assumed that a h.o .  basis is used .    studying a one - dimensional problem",
    "may seem unduly restrictive , but will in fact enable us to treat realistic multidimensional problems as well due to the symmetries of the harmonic oscillator",
    ". moreover , we choose a worst - case scenario , in which the interaction potential decays very slowly .",
    "we argue that the nature of the perturbation @xmath1 , i.e. , the non - smooth character of the coulomb potential or the trap potential , hampers the convergence properties of the method . to circumvent this problem and improve the convergence rate",
    ", we construct an effective two - body interaction via a similarity transformation .",
    "this approach , also using a h.o .",
    "basis , is routinely used in nuclear physics,@xcite where the interactions are of a completely different nature .",
    "the effective interaction is defined for a smaller space than the original hilbert space , but it reproduces exactly the lowest - lying eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian .",
    "this can be accomplished by a technique introduced by suzuki , okamoto and collaborators.@xcite approaches based on this philosophy for deriving effective interactions have been used with great success in the nuclear many - body problem.@xcite for light nuclei it provides benchmark calculations of the same quality as green s function monte carlo methods or other _ ab initio _ methods . see for example ref .   for an extensive comparison of different methods for computing properties of the nucleus @xmath2he .",
    "it was also used in a limited comparative study of large - scale diagonalization techniques and stochastic variational methods applied to quantum dots.@xcite    we demonstrate that this approach to the ci method for quantum dots yields a considerable improvement to the convergence rate .",
    "this has important consequences for studies of the time - development of quantum dots with two or more electrons , as reliable calculations of the eigenstates are crucial ingredients in studies of coherence .",
    "this is of particular importance in connection with the construction of quantum gates based on quantum dots.@xcite furthermore , the introduction of an effective interaction allows for studies of many - electron quantum dots via other many - body methods like resummation schemes such as various coupled cluster theories as well . as the effective interaction is defined only within the model space , systematic and controlled convergence studies of these methods in terms of the size of this space",

    "a widely used model for a quantum dot containing @xmath3 charged fermions is a perturbed harmonic oscillator with hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are each particle s spatial coordinate , @xmath7 is a small modification of the h.o .",
    "potential @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the coulomb interaction , viz , @xmath10 . modelling the quantum dot geometry by a perturbed harmonic oscillator",
    "is justified by self - consistent calculations,@xcite and is the stance taken by many other authors using the large - scale diagonalization technique as well.@xcite    electronic structure calculations amount to finding eigenpairs @xmath11 , e.g. , the ground state energy and wave function , such that @xmath12 here , even though the hamiltonian only contains spatial coordinates , the eigenfunction @xmath13 is a function of both the spatial coordinates @xmath14 and the spin degrees of freedom @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 the actual hilbert space is the space of the _ antisymmetric _ functions , i.e. , functions @xmath13 for which @xmath17 for all permutations @xmath18 of @xmath3 symbols . here , @xmath19 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we concentrate on one - dimensional quantum dots . even though this is not an accurate model for real quantum dots , it offers several conceptual and numerical advantages .",
    "firstly , the symmetries of the harmonic oscillator makes the numerical properties of the configuration - interaction method of this system very similar to a two or even three - dimensional model , as the analysis extends almost directly through tensor products .",
    "secondly , we may investigate many - body effects for moderate particle numbers @xmath3 while still allowing a sufficient number of h.o .",
    "basis functions for unambiguously addressing accuracy and convergence issues in numerical experiments .    in this article",
    ", we further focus on two - particle quantum dots .",
    "incidentally , for the two - particle case one can show that the hilbert space of anti - symmetric functions is spanned by functions on the form @xmath20 where the spin wave function @xmath21 can be taken as symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange , leading to an antisymmetric or symmetric spatial wave function @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "inclusion of a magnetic field @xmath23 poses no additional complications,@xcite but for simplicity we presently omit it .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to consider the spatial problem and produce properly symmetrized wavefunctions .    due to the peculiarities of the bare coulomb potential in one dimension@xcite we choose a screened approximation @xmath24 given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the strength of the interaction and @xmath27 is a screening parameter which can be interpreted as the width of the wave function orthogonal to the axis of motion .",
    "this choice is made since it is non - smooth , like the bare coulomb potential in two and three dimensions .",
    "the total hamiltonian then reads @xmath28    observe that for @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 , the hamiltonian is separable .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath31 ( disregarding proper symmetrization due to the pauli principle ) become @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the eigenfunctions of the trap hamiltonian @xmath34 given by @xmath35 similarly , for a vanishing trap modification @xmath36 the hamiltonian is separable in ( normalized ) centre - of - mass coordinates given by @xmath37 indeed , any orthogonal coordinate change leaves the h.o .",

    "we write the @xmath3-body hamiltonian as @xmath44 with @xmath0 being the h.o .",

    "hamiltonian , if we disregard symmetrization due to the pauli principle . for the perturbation",
    ", we have @xmath50    in order to do a more general treatment , let us recall some basic facts about the harmonic oscillator .    if we consider a single particle in @xmath51-dimensional space , it is clear that the @xmath51-dimensional harmonic oscillator hamiltonian is the sum of one - dimensional h.o .",
    "hamiltonians for each euclidean coordinate , viz , @xmath52 we indicate the variables on which the operators depend by parenthesis if there is danger of confusion . moreover , the h.o .",
    "hamiltonian for @xmath3 ( distinguishable ) particles in @xmath53 dimensions is simply @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath51-dimensional h.o .",
    "hamiltonian is manifestly separable , and the eigenfunctions are @xmath55 with energies @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the multi - index of quantum numbers @xmath58 . the one - dimensional h.o .",
    "eigenfunctions are given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the usual hermite polynomials .",
    "these functions are the hermite functions and are treated in further detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : hermite - series ] .    as for the discretization of the hilbert space",
    ", we employ a so - called _ energy - cut model space _ @xmath43 , defined by the span of all h.o .",
    "eigenfunctions with energies up to a given @xmath61 , viz , @xmath62 where we bear in mind that the @xmath63 dimensions are distributed among the @xmath3 particles .    for the one - dimensional model with only one particle",
    ", the model space reduces to @xmath64 thus , one particle is associated with one integer quantum number @xmath65 , denoting the `` shell number where the particle resides '' , in typical terms . for two particles , we get @xmath66 we illustrate this space in fig .  [",
    "fig : simtransfp ] .     and",
    "@xmath67 , the sum of which does not exceed @xmath68.[fig : simtransfp ] ]    proper symmetrization must also be applied .",
    "however , the hamiltonian commutes with particle permutations , meaning that the eigenfunctions _ will _ be symmetric or antisymmetric , assuming that the eigenvalues are distinct . in the case of degeneracy , we may simply produce ( anti)symmetric eigenfunctions by taking linear combinations .",
    "we mention that other model spaces can also be used ; most common is perhaps the _ direct product model space _ , defined by @xmath3 direct products of @xmath69 rather than a cut in energy as above .",
    "it is obvious that any orthogonal coordinate change @xmath70 where @xmath71 commutes with @xmath72 . in particular ,",
    "energy is conserved under the coordinate change .",
    "therefore , the eigenfunctions of the transformed hamiltonian will be a linear combination of the original eigenfunctions of the same energy , viz , @xmath73 where the sum is over all @xmath74 such that @xmath75 . here",
    ", @xmath76 performs the coordinate change , viz , @xmath77 where @xmath76 is unitary . also note that energy conservation implies that @xmath43 is invariant with respect to the coordinate change , implying that the ci method is equivalent in the two coordinate systems .",
    "an important example is the centre - of - mass transformation introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "this transformation is essential when we want to compute the hamiltonian matrix since the interaction is given in terms of these coordinates .",
    "observe that in the case when the hamiltonian is in fact separated by such a coordinate change , the formulation of the _ exact _ problem using h.o .",
    "basis is equivalent to two one - particle problems using h.o .",
    "basis in the new coordinates .",
    "[ sec : hermite - series ]    in order to understand the accuracy of the ci method , we need to study the approximation properties of the hermite functions .",
    "note that all the hermite functions @xmath78 spanning @xmath79 are _",
    "smooth_. indeed , they are holomorphic in the entire complex plane",
    ". any finite linear combination of these will yield another holomorphic function , so any non - smooth function will be badly approximated .",
    "this simple fact is sadly neglected in the configuration - interaction literature , and we choose to stress it here : even though the hermite functions are simple to compute and deal with , arising in a natural way from the consideration of a perturbation of the h.o .  and obeying a wealth of beautiful relations , they are not very well suited for computation of functions whose smoothness is less than infinitely differentiable , or whose decay behaviour for large @xmath80 is algebraic , i.e. , @xmath81 for some @xmath82 . due to the direct product nature of the @xmath3-body basis functions ,",
    "it is clear that these considerations are general , and not restricted to the one - dimensional one - particle situation .",
    "consider an expansion @xmath83 in hermite functions of an arbitrary @xmath84 .",
    "the coefficients are given by @xmath85 here , @xmath86 are the normalized hermite polynomials . if @xmath87 is well approximated by the basis , the coefficients @xmath88 will decay quickly with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "least _ rate of convergence is a direct consequence of @xmath89 hence we must have @xmath90 .",
    "( this is _ not _ a sufficient condition , however . ) with further restrictions on the behaviour of @xmath87 , the decay will be faster .",
    "this is analogous to the faster decay of fourier coefficients for smoother functions,@xcite although for hermite functions , smoothness is not the only parameter as we consider an infinite domain . in this case , another equally important feature is the decay of @xmath87 as @xmath80 grows , which is intuitively clear given that all the hermite functions decay as @xmath91 .",
    "let us prove this assertion .",
    "we give here a simple argument due to boyd ( ref .  ) , but we strengthen the result somewhat .    to this end , assume that @xmath87 has @xmath92 square integrable derivatives ( in the weak sense ) and that @xmath93 is square integrable for @xmath94 .",
    "note that this is a sufficient condition for @xmath95 and @xmath96 up to @xmath97 to be square integrable as well .",
    "here , @xmath98 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath99 are the well - known ladder operators for the harmonic oscillator.@xcite    using integration by parts , the formula for @xmath88 becomes @xmath100\\bar{h}_{n+1}(x)e^{-x^2/2}\\;\\mathrm{d } x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the hermite expansion coefficients of @xmath103 . since @xmath104 by assumption ,",
    "we obtain @xmath105 implying @xmath106 repeating this argument @xmath92 times , we obtain the estimate @xmath107    it is clear that if @xmath87 is infinitely differentiable , and if in addition @xmath87 decays faster than any power of @xmath108 , such as for example exponentially decaying functions , or functions behaving like @xmath109 , @xmath88 will decay faster than _ any _ power of @xmath110 , so - called `` infinite - order convercence , '' or `` spectral convergence . '' indeed , hille ( ref .  )",
    "gives results for the decay of the hermite coefficients for a wide class of functions .",
    "the most important for our application being the following : if @xmath87 decays as @xmath109 , with @xmath111 , and if @xmath112 is the distance from the real axis to the nearest pole of @xmath87 ( when considered as a complex function ) , then @xmath113 a very rapid decay for even moderate @xmath114 .",
    "an extremely useful property@xcite of the hermite functions is the fact that they are uniformly bounded , viz , @xmath115 as a consequence , the _ pointwise _ error in a truncated series is almost everywhere bounded by @xmath116 thus , estimating the error in the expansion amounts to estimating the sum of the neglected coefficients . if @xmath117 , @xmath118 for the error in the mean , @xmath119 as is seen by approximating @xmath120 by an integral .    in the above , `` almost everywhere '' , or `` a.e . '' for short , refers to the fact that we do not distinguish between square integrable functions that differ on a point set of lebesgue measure zero .",
    "moreover , there is a subtle distinction between the notations @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for a given function @xmath123 , @xmath124 if @xmath125 , while @xmath126 if we have @xmath127 ; a slightly weaker statement .",
    "let us apply the above results to the eigenproblem for a perturbed one - dimensional harmonic oscillator , i.e. , @xmath128\\psi(x ) , \\label{eq : perturbed - osc}\\ ] ] which is also applicable when the two - particle hamiltonian is separable , i.e. , when @xmath29 or @xmath129 .",
    "it is now clear that under the assumption that @xmath130 is @xmath92 times differentiable ( in the weak sense ) , and that @xmath131 as @xmath132 , the eigenfunctions will be @xmath133 times ( weakly ) differentiable and decay as @xmath91 for large @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the hermite expansion coefficients of @xmath87 will decay as @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath130 is analytic in a strip of width @xmath112 around the real axis , the same will be true for @xmath87 , such that we can use eq .   to estimate the coefficients .",
    "a word of caution is however at its place .",
    "although we have argued that if a given function can be differentiated @xmath92 times ( in the weak sense ) then the coefficients decay as @xmath134 , @xmath136 , it may happen that this decay `` kicks in '' too late to be observable in practical circumstances .",
    "consider for example the following function : @xmath137 which has exactly one ( almost everywhere continuous ) derivative and decays as @xmath91 .",
    "however , the derivative is seen to have a jump discontinuity of magnitude @xmath138 at @xmath139 .",
    "from the theory , we expect @xmath140 decay of the coefficients , but for small @xmath141 the first derivative is badly approximated , so we expect to observe only @xmath142 decay for moderate @xmath65 , due to the fact that the rate of decay of the coefficients of @xmath143 are _ explicitely _ given in terms of the coefficients of @xmath144 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bad - func ] the decay rates at different @xmath65 and for various @xmath141 are displayed .",
    "the decay rate @xmath145 is computed by estimating the slope of the graph of @xmath146 versus @xmath147 , a technique used thoughout this article .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath141 we observe only @xmath148 convergence in practical settings , where @xmath65 is moderate , while larger @xmath141 gives @xmath149 even for small @xmath65 .",
    "the above function was chosen due to its relation to the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , its coefficients are given by @xmath150 i.e. , the proportional to the first row of the interaction matrix .",
    "moreover , due to eq .  , the ground state @xmath22 of the interaction hamiltonian has a second derivative with similar behaviour near @xmath139 as @xmath143 .",
    "thus , we expect to observe @xmath151 , rather than @xmath152 , for the available range of @xmath65 in the large - scale diagonalization experiments .",
    "we remark here , that it is quite common to model quantum dot systems using non - smooth potentials@xcite @xmath7 , and even to use the ci method with h.o .",
    "basis functions on these models.@xcite      we wish to apply the above analysis by considering the model hamiltonian .",
    "we first consider the case where @xmath36 or @xmath153 , respectively , which reduces the two - particle problem to one - dimensional problems through separation of variables , i.e. , the diagonalization of the trap hamiltonian @xmath34 and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath154 in eqs .   and .",
    "then we turn to the complete non - separable problem .    for simplicity",
    "we consider the trap @xmath155 with @xmath156 which gives rise to a double - well potential or a single - well potential , depending on the parameters , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential - discussion ] .",
    "the perturbation is everywhere analytic and rapidly decaying .",
    "this indicates that the corresponding configuration - interaction energies and wave functions also should converge rapidly . in the below numerical experiments , we use @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , creating the asymmetric double well in fig .  [",
    "fig : potential - discussion ] .",
    "for the interaction hamiltonian @xmath154 and its potential @xmath160 we arbitrarily choose @xmath161 and @xmath162 , giving a moderate jump discontinuity in the derivative .",
    "as these problems are both one - dimensional , the model space reduces to @xmath69 as given in eq .  .",
    "each problem then amounts to diagonalizing a matrix @xmath163 with elements    @xmath164    with @xmath165 or @xmath166 .",
    "we compute the matrix to desired precision using gauss - legendre quadrature . in order to obtain reference eigenfunctions and eigenvalues",
    "we use a constant reference potential method@xcite implemented in the matslise package@xcite for matlab .",
    "this yields results accurate to about 14 significant digits .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric ] ( left ) the magnitude of the coefficients of the _ exact _ ground states alongside the ground state energy error and wave function error ( right ) are graphed for each hamiltonian , using successively larger @xmath68 .",
    "the coefficients of the exact ground states decay according to expectations , as we clearly have spectral convergence for the @xmath34 ground state , and @xmath167 convergence for the @xmath154 ground state .",
    "these aspects are clearly reflected in the ci calculations .",
    "both the @xmath34 ground state energy and wave function converge spectrally with increasing @xmath68 , while for @xmath154 we clearly have algebraic convergence .",
    "note that for @xmath34 , @xmath168 yields a ground state energy accurate to @xmath169 , and that such precision would require @xmath170 for @xmath154 , which converges only algebraically .    intuitively , these results are easy to understand : for the trap hamiltonian a modest value of @xmath68 produces almost exact results , since the exact ground state has extremely small components outside the model space .",
    "this is not possible for the interaction hamiltonian , whose exact ground state is poorly approximated in the model space alone .",
    "if we consider the complete hamiltonian , we now expect the error to be dominated by the low - order convergence of the interaction hamiltonian eigenproblem .",
    "[ fig : numeric ] also shows the error in the ground state energy for the corresponding two - particle calculation , and the error is indeed seen to behave identically to the @xmath154 ground state energy error .",
    "( that the energy error curve is almost on top of the error in the _ wave function _ for @xmath154 is merely a coincidence . )",
    "it is clear that the non - smooth character of the potential @xmath171 destroys the convergence of the method .",
    "the eigenfunctions will be non - smooth , while the basis functions are all very smooth .",
    "of course , a non - smooth potential @xmath172 would destroy the convergence as well .    in this sense",
    ", we speak of a `` small perturbation @xmath1 '' if the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the total hamiltonian converge spectrally .",
    "otherwise , the perturbation is so strong that the very smoothness property of the eigenfunctions vanish . in our case , even for arbitrary small interaction strengths @xmath26 , the eigenfunctions are non - smooth , so that the interaction is never small in the sense defined here . on the other hand ,",
    "the trap modification @xmath172 represents a small perturbation of the harmonic oscillator if it is smooth and rapidly decaying .",
    "this points to the basic deficiency of the choice of h.o .",
    "basis functions : they do not capture the properties of the eigenfunctions .",
    "we could overcome this problem by choosing a different set of basis functions for the hilbert space , and thus a different model space @xmath43 altogether .",
    "however , the symmetries of the h.o .  lets us treat the interaction potential with ease by explicitly performing the centre - of - mass transformation , a significant advantage in many - body calculations . in our one - dimensional case , we could replace @xmath173 by a smooth potential ; after all @xmath171 is just an approximation somewhat randomly chosen .",
    "we would then obtain much better results with the ci method .",
    "however , we are not willing to trade the bare coulomb interaction in two ( or even three ) dimensions for an approximation .",
    "after all we know that the singular and long - range nature of the interaction is essential .",
    "we therefore propose to use _ effective interaction theory _ known from many - body physics to improve the accuray of ci calculations for quantum dots .",
    "this replaces the matrix in the h.o .",
    "basis of the interaction term with an approximation , giving exact eigenvalues in the case of no trap perturbation @xmath172 , regardless of the energy cut parameter @xmath68 .",
    "we can not hope to gain spectral convergence ; the eigenfunctions are still non - smooth .",
    "however , we can increase the algebraic convergence considerably by modifying the interaction matrix for the given model space .",
    "this is explained in detail in the next section .",
    "the theories of effective interactions have been , and still are , vital ingredients in many - body physics , from quantum chemistry to nuclear physics.@xcite in fields like nuclear physics , due to the complicated nature of the nuclear interactions , no exact spatial potential exists for the interactions between nucleons .",
    "computation of the matrix elements of the many - body hamiltonian then amounts to computing , for example , successively complicated feynman diagrams,@xcite motivating realistic yet tractable approximations such as effective two - body interactions .",
    "these effective interactions are in turn used as starting points for diagonalization calculations in selected model spaces.@xcite alternatively , they can be used as starting point for the resummation of selected many - body correlations such as in coupled - cluster theories.@xcite in our case , it is the so - called _ curse of dimensionality _ that makes a direct approach unfeasible : the number of h.o .",
    "states needed to generate accurate energies and wave functions grows exponentially with the number of particles in the system .",
    "indeed , the dimension of @xmath43 grows as @xmath174    for the derivation of the effective interaction , we consider the hamiltonian in centre - of - mass coordinates , i.e. , @xmath175 for @xmath176 , the hamiltonian is clearly not separable .",
    "the idea is then to treat @xmath177 as perturbations of a system separable in centre - of - mass coordinates ; after all the trap potential is assumed to be smooth .",
    "this new unperturbed hamiltonian reads @xmath178 where @xmath179 , or any other interaction in a more general setting .",
    "we wish to replace the ci matrix of @xmath180 with a different matrix @xmath181 , having the exact eigenvalues of @xmath180 , but necessarily only approximate eigenvectors .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath181 can be viewed as an operator acting in the model space while embodying information about the original interaction in the _ complete _ space @xmath182 . we know that this otherwise neglected",
    "part of hilbert space is very important if @xmath183 is not small .",
    "thus , the first ingredient is the splitting of the hilbert space into the model space @xmath184 and the _ excluded space _ @xmath185 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the orthogonal projector onto the model space .    in the following",
    ", we let @xmath3 be the dimension of the model space @xmath43 . there should be no danger of confusion with the number of particles @xmath186 , as this is now fixed .",

    "we quickly calculate @xmath207 and hence for any @xmath208 we have @xmath209 yielding all the non - zero matrix elements of @xmath190 .    as for the vectors @xmath206",
    ", we do not know _ a priori _ the exact eigenfunctions of @xmath180 , of course .",

    "the usual way to find the eigenvalues is to solve a much larger problem with @xmath210 and then assume that these eigenvalues are `` exact '' .",
    "the reason why this is possible at all is that our hamiltonian @xmath180 is separable , and therefore easier to solve .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we treat the two - dimensional coulomb problem similarly .",
    "the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath180 differ from those of the the effective hamiltonian @xmath181 . in this section ,",
    "we first make a qualitative comparison between the ground states of each hamiltonian .",
    "we then turn to a numerical study of the error in the ci method when using the effective interaction in a the model problem .",
    "recall that the ground state eigenvectors are on the form @xmath218 for @xmath181 , @xmath219 for all @xmath220 , so that the excluded space - part of the error concides with the excluded space - part of the exact ground state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : effective - eigenvectors ] the coefficients @xmath88 for both @xmath180 and @xmath181 are displayed .",

    "this is expected since @xmath221 and the exact ground state is non - smooth there .",
    "notice the slow spatial decay of the error , intuitively explained by the slow decay of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we now turn to a simulation of the full two - particle hamiltonian , and compare the decay of the ground state energy error with and without the effective interaction .",

    "we remark that the new hamiltonian matrix has the _ same structure _ as the original matrix .",
    "it is only the values of the interaction matrix elements that are changed .",
    "hence , the new scheme has the same complexity as the ci method if we disregard the computation of @xmath194 , which is a one - time calculation of low complexity .",
    "the results are striking : in fig .",
    "[ fig : full - dot - sim ] we see that the ground state error decays as @xmath224 , compared to @xmath225 for the original ci method . for @xmath226 ,",

    "we comment that @xmath230 is the practical limit on a single desktop computer for a two - dimensional two - particle simulation . adding more particles",
    "further restricts this limit , emphasizing the importance of the gain achieved in the relative error .    .",
    "for the ci method without effective interactions , we obtain @xmath231 , while the effective interactions gives @xmath232 .",

    "i.e. , near - symmetric wells , the parameter estimation was difficult in the effective interaction case due to very quick convergence of the energy .",

    "[ fig : alpha ] contour plots of the obtained results are shown . for the shown range , results were unambiguous .",
    "these numerical results clearly indicate that the effective interaction approach will gain valuable numerical precision over the original ci method in general ; in fact we have gained nearly two orders of magnitude in the decay rate of the error .",
    "one - dimensional quantum dot models are of limited value in themselves .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath180 have the structure @xmath248 where @xmath249 and @xmath250 are the centre - of - mass and relative coordinate quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "again , the degeneracy structure and even spacing of the eigenvalues are destroyed in the ci approach , and we wish to regain it with the effective interaction .",
    "we then choose the eigenvectors corresponding to the quantum numbers @xmath251 to build our effective hamiltonian @xmath181 .",
    "let us also mention , that the exact eigenvectors @xmath252 are non - smooth due to the @xmath253-singularity of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the approximation properties of the hermite functions are then directly applicable as before , when we expand the eigenfunctions in h.o .  basis functions .",
    "hence , the configuration - interaction method will converge slowly also in the two - dimensional case .",
    "it is good reason to believe that effective interaction experiments will yield similarly positive results with respect to convergence improvement .    clearly , the above procedure is applicable to three - dimensional problems as well .",
    "the operator @xmath180 is separable and we obtain a single non - trivial radial equation , and thus we may apply our effective hamiltonian procedure . the exact eigenvalues will have the structure @xmath254 on which we base the choice of the effective hamiltonian eigenvectors as before .    the effective interaction approach to the configuration - interaction calculations is easily extended to a many - particle problem , whose hamiltonian is given by eq .  .",

    "[ sec : effective - interactions ] can simply replace these terms .",
    "a theoretical understanding of the behavior of many - body systems is a great challenge and provides fundamental insights into quantum mechanical studies , as well as offering potential areas of applications .",

    "application of other methods , such as coupled - cluster calculations , are also an interesting approach , and can give further refinements on the convergence , as well as gaining insight into the behaviour of the numerical methods in general .",

    "the effective two - body interaction derived from an @xmath3-body system , however , is not necessarly the same .",
    "intuitively , one can think of the former approach as neglecting interactions and scattering between three or more two particles at a time . in nuclear physics ,",
    "such three - body correlations are non - negligible and improve the convergence in terms of the number of harmonic oscillator shells.@xcite our hope is that such interactions are much less important for coulomb systems .    moreover , as mentioned in the introduction , accurate determination of eigenvalues is essential for simulations of quantum dots in the time domain .",
