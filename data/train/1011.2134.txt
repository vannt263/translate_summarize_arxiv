    "this paper attempts to extract the topology of real grassmannians based on a _ realization _ of the manifolds related to the kp hierarchy . as in the case of the real flag manifolds discussed in @xcite using the toda lattice hierarchy ,",
    "we here show that the kp equation can be used to obtain similar results for the real grassmannians .",
    "the kp equation is a two - dimensional extension of the well - known kdv equation , and it was introduced by kadomtsev and petviashvili in 1970 to study the stability of one kdv soliton under the influence of weak two - dimensional perturbations @xcite .",
    "the equation provides also a model to describe a two - dimensional shallow water wave phenomena ( see for example @xcite .",
    "the kp equation is a dispersive wave equation for the scaler function @xmath3 with spatial variables @xmath4 and time variable @xmath5 , and is given by @xmath6 we write the solution in the form @xmath7 where the function @xmath8 is called the _",
    "function of the kp equation @xcite .",
    "it is also well - known that some of the exact solutions can be written in the wronskian determinant form ( see for example @xcite ) , @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and each of the functions @xmath11 satisfies the simple linear equations , @xmath12 we then take the following finite dimensional solutions , ( i.e. finite fourie series ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an @xmath15 real matrix of rank @xmath16 , and @xmath17 s are real and distinct numbers , say @xmath18 since @xmath17 s are all distinct , the set of exponential functions @xmath19 is linearly independent and forms a basis of @xmath20 .",
    "then the set of @xmath21 defines a @xmath16-dimensional subspace in @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that each solution defined by the @xmath8-function can be characterized by the @xmath22-matrix , hence the solution parametrizes a point of the real grassmannian .",
    "note here that the grassmannian denoted by @xmath23 can be described as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the set of all @xmath15 matrices of rank @xmath16 , and @xmath26 is the general linear group of @xmath27 matrices .",
    "we then expect that some particular solutions of the kp equation contain certain information on the cohomology of @xmath23 .",
    "this is our main motivation for the present study . in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we found the similar results for the case of real flag variety using the toda lattice equation .",
    "let us explain how some solutions contain information of the cohomology of @xmath23 by taking simple example with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "that is , we recover the cohomology of real variety @xmath30 from a kp flow .",
    "we consider the @xmath8-function in the form , @xmath31 where @xmath32 are arbitrary non - zero real constants .",
    "since @xmath33 can be absorbed in the exponential term , we only consider their signs , and here we assume @xmath34 ( which we refer to as _ kp signs _ ) .",
    "let us consider the case with the specific signs @xmath35 .",
    "using simple asymptotic argument , one can easily find that each @xmath36 becomes dominant in certain region of the @xmath37-plane for a fixed @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : g14 ] illustrates the contour plots of the solution @xmath38 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "each region marked by the number @xmath41 indicates the dominant exponential @xmath42 , and at the boundary of the region , the @xmath8-function can be expressed by two exponential functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( which is dominant in the adjacent region ) , i.e. writing @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 \\displaystyle{\\sinh\\half(\\theta_i-\\theta_j)}\\quad&{\\rm if}\\quad\\epsilon_i\\epsilon_j=- .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then at the boundary , the solution has the following form depending on the sign @xmath47 , @xmath48",
    "\\displaystyle{{\\rm csch}^2\\half(\\theta_i-\\theta_j)}\\quad&{\\rm if}\\quad\\epsilon_i\\epsilon_j=- . \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure [ fig : g14 ] , the sech - part ( regular ) of the solution is shown by the dark colored contour , and the csch - part ( singular ) is shown in the light colored contour .",
    "-function given by .",
    "the signs are chosen as @xmath35 . in the left two figures , the number @xmath41 of each region represents the dominant exponential @xmath42 , and the dark ( light ) colored contour shows the regular ( singular ) part of the solution .",
    "the left figure shows the contour plot of the solution at @xmath49 and the middle one is at @xmath50 .",
    "the tetrahedron in the figures indicates as a dual graph of the solution pattern , that is , the vertices of the polytope are labeled by the dominant exponentials .",
    "the directed curve in the right figure shows a flow of the kp equation , and this flow blows up twice by crossing the boundary between the regions with different signs , which corresponds to @xmath51 . ]    we construct a polytope whose vertices are labeled by the dominant exponentials .",
    "the polytope for our example is a tetrahedron as shown in figure [ fig : g14 ] .",
    "we then consider a kp flow choosing a particular parameter set @xmath52 , so that the flow is passing near the edges of the polytope .",
    "the flow might be expressed as a graph , @xmath53 where @xmath54 shows the singular flow , and the @xmath55 shows the regular one .",
    "it is then interesting to note that the graph is the incidence graph of the real projective space @xmath56 , if the arrows are identified as the coboundary operators and their incidence numbers are assigned as @xmath57 for @xmath54 and @xmath58 for @xmath55 .",
    "this kind of graph , exemplified by graph , was introduced in @xcite in an initial attempt to compute the number of connected components carved up by the zero divisors of the @xmath8-function , i.e. @xmath59 for some @xmath60 , within a moment polytope for the toda flow . in the case of the kp flow figure [ fig : g14 ]",
    "shows that this graph does not contain enough information to attempt to do this ( one would have to connect ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) with an edge @xmath55 ) . still the main results in @xcite , which then motivated this paper , were the result of an observation that such a graph , exclusively defined in terms of the flow crossing or not crossing singularities , agrees , in the case of the toda flow , with the incidence graph of real flag manifolds .",
    "the results in this paper extend this type of results to the kp flow .    as in @xcite",
    "a polynomial can be defined by counting singularities crossed and taking an alternating sum .",
    "in this case we obtain @xmath61 , and now @xmath62 , with @xmath2 a power of a prime number , counts the number of points over a finite field , @xmath63 , of a variety closely related to @xmath64 .",
    "this is explained in more detail below and generalized .",
    "the cohomology calculation can be thought of as actually taking place over a field of positive characteristic ( etale cohomology ) so that these @xmath65 , @xmath60 counting singularties crossed , appear as frobenius eigenvalues in cohomology .",
    "one should note in the graph that the numbers @xmath41 representing the dominant exponential @xmath42 label the schubert cells of the variety @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the schubert cell of dimension @xmath68 ( see section [ gras ] ) . in this paper , we intend to show that this view of the kp flow can be used to construct the incidence graph of the real grassmann variety @xmath23 in general .    we simply denote @xmath69 by @xmath0 .",
    "here we present an overview of the paper .",
    "let @xmath70 be the symmetric group with the simple reflections @xmath71 for @xmath72 , and @xmath73 be the parabolic subgroup of @xmath70 generated by @xmath74 .",
    "we then have the schubert decomposition of @xmath0 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the set of minimal coset representatives of @xmath77 ( @xcite , see also section [ action ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the integral cohomology of @xmath0 which we find by constructing the corresponding incidence graph ( section [ grafica ] ) .",
    "the co - chain complex may be expressed as follows : the set of the co - chains are defined by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the length of @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , the schubert cycle . for each @xmath82",
    ", we define an operator @xmath83 in the form , for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86\\,\\langle w'\\rangle.\\ ] ] where @xmath87 for all @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath90 $ ] takes the value either @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( @xcite , see also section [ grafica ] ) .",
    "then we define a graph @xmath91 , which can be described along the kp flow , and which consists of the vertices given by @xmath92 for @xmath93 and the edges given by the ( double ) arrows between @xmath92 and @xmath94 when @xmath90\\ne0 $ ] , that is , there is no blow up . for example , in the case of @xmath95 , we have @xmath96\\oplus\\mathbb{z}[\\langle s_1\\rangle]\\oplus\\mathbb{z}[\\langle s_2s_1\\rangle]\\oplus\\mathbb{z}[\\langle s_3s_2s_1\\rangle]$ ] , and the graph @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 this graph is the incidence graph for @xmath56 when we assign the coefficients as @xmath99=0 , [ s_1;s_2s_1]=\\pm 2 $ ] and @xmath100=0 $ ] ( cf . ) . this can be extended to the general case , and in section [ teorema ] , we prove the main theorem ,    [ main1 ] the graph @xmath91 is the incidence graph for the real grassmannian @xmath0 .",
    "the proof of this theorem is based on @xcite and a simplified description of these results for the real split case which are described in terms of the toda lattice in @xcite ; finally an adaptation of @xcite so that incidence graphs are expressed exclusively in terms of the kp flow , which , it turns out , further simplifies the case of real grassmanians allowing easy explicit calculation of betti numbers .",
    "based on the graph @xmath91 , we then derive explicit formulas for betti numbers of real grassmanians , and discuss relations of these betti numbers to the number of points over a finite field of certain related varieties . for this computation ,",
    "we first replace the real grassmanian manifold @xmath0 with a complex manifold , a zariski open subset @xmath101 with the same homotopy type ( see subsection [ fqpoints ] for the details ) .",
    "the variety @xmath102 can be considered over other fields , for example , a finite field @xmath103 with @xmath2 elements .",
    "the number of @xmath103 points i.e. the number of points on @xmath104 , is given by a polynomial of @xmath2 denoted by @xmath105 . in section [ ppolynomial ]",
    ", we show that the polynomial @xmath105 is related to the poincar polynomial of the real variety @xmath0 .",
    "the cohomology of @xmath0 is much more complicated than the cohomology of the complex variety @xmath106 , since it involves torsion .",
    "however we find that , the betti numbers of @xmath106 and @xmath107 for some @xmath108 determined from @xmath109 agree after taking into account a change in degrees . recall that the poincare polynomial of the complex variety @xmath110 , denoted by @xmath111 , is simply obtained by the number of @xmath1 points , @xmath112 .",
    "that is , we have @xmath113_{t^2},\\ ] ] here the polynomial @xmath114_q}$ ] is a @xmath2-analog of the binomial coefficient @xmath115 ( see section [ gras ] ) .",
    "the simplest example is the case of @xmath116 which is a circle @xmath117 and can be described with an equation @xmath118 .",
    "the number of @xmath63 points of @xmath119 , that is the number of the solutions of @xmath118 for @xmath120 , is @xmath121 ( see remark [ points ] below ) .",
    "we thus have a polynomial in @xmath2 , namely , @xmath122 and we note that this gives the betti numbers @xmath123 as coefficients of @xmath124 , @xmath125 , in the polynomial , i.e. @xmath126 .",
    "namely the poincar polynomial for @xmath119 denoted by @xmath127 is given by @xmath128    [ points ] in fact , there are two formulas for the number of points of @xmath118 over @xmath63 depending on @xmath2 ( @xmath2 not a power of @xmath129 ) .",
    "for instance over @xmath130 we have @xmath131 ; however over @xmath132 there @xmath133 . by extending @xmath130 to @xmath134 ( adding @xmath135 )",
    ", the number of @xmath63 points with @xmath136 becomes @xmath121 .",
    "we assume in this paper @xmath137 .    in a similar computation ( see the subsection [ fqpoints ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the number of @xmath1 points of @xmath138 as @xmath139 the poincar polynomial for this case is given by @xmath140 and the relation with @xmath141 is not obvious , but we note that the replacement @xmath142 to @xmath143 gives the relation between those polynomials .",
    "it turns out that the similar replacement can be done for the general cases of @xmath144 ( see the subsection [ power ] ) .",
    "a more interesting example is @xmath145which is discussed in example [ isotropic ] below .",
    "the polynomial that results in this case is @xmath146 giving the number of @xmath63 points on gr@xmath147 .",

    "the polynomial @xmath157 has an interesting connection with the kp flow .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath158 discussed above , the flow blows up twice along the orbit considered ( see figure [ fig : g14 ] ) .",
    "then we consider the following polynomial @xmath159 where @xmath160 counts the number of blow - ups from @xmath161 to @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "namely , we also assign powers @xmath165 to the vertex labeled by @xmath93 which keep track of the number of blow - ups from @xmath166 to @xmath167 .",
    "then each vertex in the graph @xmath91 would have additional label @xmath165 , which defines the _ weighted _ schubert cell ( see subsection [ power ] ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath158 , we have the graph with the weighted schbert cells @xmath168 ( see figure [ fig : g14 ] ) , @xmath169 the polynomial @xmath157 appears in @xmath105 given above , and in section [ fqpoints ] , we show that this is true in general . without technicalities ,",
    "the main result is that these polynomials @xmath157 times certain power of @xmath2 compute the number of @xmath63 points .",
    "the polynomial in @xmath5 given by @xmath170 is the corresponding poincar polynomial .",
    "the cases of the form @xmath171 turn out to be exceptions obeying a slightly different formula . excluding the exceptional cases",
