    "the main examples of tubular groups are constructed from @xmath0 by amalgamating along cyclic subgroups .",
    "tubular groups have been used as examples of various phenomena . brady and bridson computed isoperimetric functions for the groups @xmath1=1,\\ , x^{-1}a^px = a^rb,\\,y^{-1}a^py = a^rb^{-1}\\right>\\ ] ] with @xmath2 and found that the degrees of the isoperimetric functions form a dense set in @xmath3 .",
    "the dehn function of @xmath4 is @xmath5 with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "later brady , bridson , forester and shankar , @xcite , used more complicated examples of tubular groups , called `` snowflake groups '' , to show that all the rationals in that interval appear .",
    "other examples include the examples of croke and kleiner @xcite and wise s group @xcite .",
    "there are two quasi - isometry invariants readily available among these groups . for the brady - bridson and snowflake groups we have the isoperimetric exponent .",
    "mosher , sageev and whyte give another : the collection of affine equivalence classes of edge patterns @xcite .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we gave an algorithm to decide whether or not two tubular groups are quasi - isometric . in the course of the proof we constructed a tree , the `` tree of p  sets '' , related to the bass - serre tree of a particular graph of groups decomposition of the group .",
    "the ( directed ) edges of this tree come with a parameter , the `` height change across the edge '' .",
    "the maximum slope invariant for the tubular group is then the maximum coarse slope of any ray in the tree , where coarse slope is average height change per unit length , in an appropriate sense .",
    "it follows from the quasi - isometry algorithm that the maximum coarse slope is a quasi - isometry invariant of the group ( at least in certain cases ) .    among the groups @xmath4 the edge patterns",
    "are all equivalent and it turns out that the isoperimetric exponent is a complete quasi - isometry invariant",
    ". one might wonder whether the equivalence classes of edge patterns and the isoperimetric exponent always determine the quasi - isometry class of a tubular group .",
    "the answer is `` no '' . in this note",
    "we give an example of two tubular groups with the same equivalence classes of edge patterns and the same isoperimetric exponent but different maximum slopes .",
    "the method of computing the maximum slopes is easy and generalizes to many classes of tubular groups .",
    "dehn functions for tubular groups are known only for special cases , and running the quasi - isometry algorithm of @xcite is laborious , so , in practice , checking that maximum slopes are equal is a good test to perform before running the quasi - isometry algorithm .",
    "in this section we recall the necessary terminology and facts about tubular groups and quasi - isometries of tubular groups .",
    "we simplify the exposition considerably by considering only tubular groups that are graphs of groups with vertex groups @xmath0 and edge groups @xmath7 such that the edge groups incident to a vertex inject into exactly three distinct maximal cyclic subgroups .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for more background in tubular groups and graphs of groups , and for proofs of claims in this section .",
    "consider a graph of groups with vertex groups @xmath0 and edge groups @xmath7 such that the edge groups incident to a vertex inject into exactly three distinct maximal cyclic subgroups .",
    "a model for such a group can be built by taking a torus for each vertex , an annulus for each edge , and gluing a boundary of an annulus to a torus according to the corresponding edge injection .    if we then choose a metric on each torus and annulus and lift to the universal cover we get a geodesic metric space quasi - isometric to the group , which we call the _",
    "geometric model_.    consider one of the vertex @xmath8 groups .",
    "suppose @xmath9=1\\right>$ ] .",
    "the `` usual '' metric is the one for which the word @xmath10 in @xmath0 corresponds to the point with cartesian coordinates @xmath11 in the standard euclidean plane .",
    "suppose the incident edge groups inject into the maximal cyclic subgroups containing @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are distinct .",
    "this can be arranged by picking a new generating set , if necessary , since we have assumed that there are three distinct maximal cyclic subgroups .",
    "this means that with this choice of coordinates , in the universal cover the edge spaces incident to this vertex space attach along lines of slope @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for any of these slopes , since the edge group @xmath7 is infinite index in the vertex group @xmath0 , in the universal cover we have infinitely many edge spaces gluing on to the vertex space along lines of the same slope .",
    "we will have three different infinite families of parallel lines in the plane .",
    "this collection of families of infinite lines is called the _ edge pattern _ in the vertex space .    from work of mosher , sageev and whyte @xcite we know that a quasi - isometry of tubular groups takes vertex groups to within bounded distance of vertex groups .",
    "we also know that these edge patterns are the coarse intersection patterns of the various vertex spaces , and must be preserved up to bounded error by quasi - isometries .",
    "furthermore , when there are infinite families of at least three different slopes in a plane , then only quasi - isometries of the plane that preserve the three families are bounded distance from an affine map .",
    "therefore , the affine equivalence class of the set of slopes in a vertex space is a quasi - isometry invariant of the group .    for our examples we may assume that any quasi - isometry restricts on each vertex space to an affine map that takes three specified slopes to three specified slopes .",
    "projectively there is a unique map that does this , so the only freedom in the map is translation and rescaling the entire plane by a constant .",
    "moreover , there is a convenient choice of metric that will make quasi - isometries on the vertex spaces particularly nice .",
    "choose the metric on the vertex group so that the word @xmath10 corresponds to the vector @xmath18 in the plane , where @xmath19 is the matrix : @xmath20    this is a convenient choice because it makes the line pattern symmetric , the three families of parallel lines differ from one another by angle @xmath21 .",
    "any permutation of the slopes can be achieved by an isometry of the plane .",
    "once the metrics have been chosen on the vertex groups we can define height change across an edge .",
    "each edge group is @xmath7 .",
    "define the stretch factor across the ( directed ) edge to be the ratio of the lengths of the image of the generator of the edge group in the two adjacent vertex groups .",
    "the _ height change _ across the edge is @xmath22 .      for @xmath23 ,",

    "this bijection of vertices can be extended to a continuous map @xmath32 by connecting the dots .",
    "the height change between two vertices of the bass - serre tree of a tubular group is the sum of the height changes across the edges of the geodesic segment joining the vertices .",
    "the quasi - isometry @xmath33 is coarsely height preserving in the sense that there is some constant @xmath34 so that for any two vertices @xmath35 , the height change between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is within @xmath34 of the height change between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be a geodesic ray .",
    "a quasi - isometry @xmath28 induces a bijection @xmath29 from vertices of @xmath30 to vertices of @xmath31 , but does not necessarily preserve adjacency .",
    "thus , the ray @xmath41 may not be a geodesic ray .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be edges incident to a vertex @xmath38 in @xmath25 .",
    "we say that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are _ parallel at @xmath38 _ if @xmath44 and @xmath45 are parallel lines in @xmath46 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are parallel at @xmath38 if their stabilizer subgroups in @xmath24 are contained in a common maximal cyclic subgroup of the stabilizer of @xmath38 .",
    "we say that @xmath47 _ has a twist at @xmath48 _ ( or at @xmath49 ) if the incoming and outgoing edges at @xmath50 are not parallel at @xmath50 .",
    "quasi - isometries preserve twists : @xmath47 has a twist at @xmath48 if and only if @xmath51 has a twist at @xmath48 .",
    "so , while the length of a segment in @xmath30 is not preserved by @xmath29 , the number of twists along that segment is , and we define the coarse slope of a ray @xmath47 in @xmath30 to be the ratio of height change to number of twists .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the number of twists of @xmath53 .",
    "a ray @xmath47 in @xmath25 _ has coarse slope _",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 , if there exists a @xmath56 such that for all @xmath48 , @xmath57    not every ray has a coarse slope , but @xmath47 has coarse slope @xmath54 if and only if @xmath51 does .",
    "the _ maximum slope _",
    "invariant of a tubular group is the quasi - isometry invariant given by the largest number @xmath54 ( possibly @xmath58 ) that occurs as the coarse slope of a ray in the bass - serre tree .",
    "( the supremum of coarse slopes is always achieved because the group acts cocompactly on the bass - serre tree . )",
    "in this section we give the procedure for computing the maximum slope , using the group @xmath4 to illustrate .",

    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be stable letters corresponding to the loop on the left and right , respectively .",
    "the labels at the ends of the edges indicate that these elements of the vertex group are conjugate by the stable letter associated to the edge , thus @xmath60 conjugates @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",

    "note that @xmath66 is negative since @xmath67 .",
    "_ step 2 : identify parallel edges _ : at each vertex , join edges with an arc if their groups inject into a common maximal cyclic subgroup .",
    "this happens exactly when the edges are parallel at the vertex .    if there is a loop in the graph such that for every edge - vertex - edge sequence in the loop the two edge groups are parallel and such that the net height change around the loop is not zero , stop .",
    "the maximum slope is infinite .    at 15 781 at 105 781 , title=\"fig : \" ]    in @xmath4 the two edge groups both map into the maximal cyclic subgroup @xmath68 at the top of .",

    "this is always possible .",
    "one way to accomplish this is to look at each remaining @xmath71 .",

    "the effect of this procedure is to collapse parallel edges at a vertex to a single edge . since we assumed that for each vertex there are exactly three maximal cyclic subgroups containing the edge injections , the original ( small black ) vertices all have valence 3 .",
