    "<S> we compare the theoretical anisotropic upper critical field @xmath0 of a quasi - two - dimensional d - wave superconductor with recent @xmath1 data for the layered organic superconductor @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find agreement both with regard to the angular and the temperature dependence of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the suggestion that the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov state ( fflo state ) exists in this material for exactly plane - parallel orientation of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> indications of precursor states , occurring for small deviations from the plane - parallel field direction , are also pointed out and further measurements for confirming the existence of the fflo state are proposed .    </S>",
    "<S> if the superconducting state in high magnetic fields is limited by paramagnetic pair breaking alone , the transition from the homogeneous superconducting state to the normal conducting state may proceed either directly , at the pauli limiting field @xmath4 , or via an interposed inhomogeneous superconducting state predicted in 1964 by fulde and ferrell  [ 1 ] and by larkin and ovchinnikov  [ 2 ] ( fflo state ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter state , which stabilizes as a consequence of spin polarization , has attracted considerable interest over the years , but has , despite of this , not yet been definitely verified experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> favourable conditions for observing the fflo state are found in clean superconductors with orbital critical fields much larger than @xmath4 . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , it seems always necessary to reduce the orbital pair breaking effect by using layered superconductors with nearly decoupled planes or extremely thin films ( quasi - two - dimensional superconductors ) and applying the magnetic field in a direction parallel to the conducting planes . </S>",
    "<S> several classes of superconducting materials with favourable conditions for observing the fflo state do exist . </S>",
    "<S> these include the `` classical '' intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides as well as more exotic materials like high-@xmath5 compounds and organic superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we refer to a recent measurement of the upper critical field @xmath1 in the organic superconductor @xmath2  [ 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this layered material shows strong anisotropy of the superconducting properties with regard to out - of - plane directions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a number of experiments listed in reference [ 3 ] are interpreted in terms of a strong in - plane anisotropy , of d - wave type , of the gap parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence length @xmath6 perpendicular to the layers of this clean material is smaller than the interlayer spacing @xmath7 and one expects an extreme reduction of orbital pair breaking for plane - parallel applied field . </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of @xmath1 was measured in ref  [ 3 ] both with respect to the angle @xmath8 between applied magnetic field and the direction normal to the conducting planes and with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath9 , which denotes the direction of magnetic field lying within the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the results showed , as expected , a strong variation of @xmath1 with @xmath8 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> no dependence on @xmath9 was observed . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal value of @xmath1 at the plane - parallel position @xmath10 was of the order of , but  50% higher than , the pauli paramagnetic limit @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these facts led the authors of reference [ 3 ] to propose that their in - plane critical field is the phase boundary between the normal - conducting state and the fflo state of a d - wave superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> we examined this question by calculating the angular and temperature dependence of the theoretical phase boundary @xmath11 between the normal - conducting state and the superconducting states of a quasi - two - dimensional d - wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the data of reference [ 3 ] showed good agreement , supporting the hypothesis that in this experiment the phase boundary of a fflo state ( for d - wave superconductors ) has been observed for the first time .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the coupling between the conducting planes of @xmath2 can be neglected , making our problem effectively two - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> then , if the field has both a perpendicular and a parallel component , the superconducting state is limited by both orbital and paramagnetic pair breaking . for exactly plane - parallel magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> the fflo phase should be realized below a reduced temperature ( @xmath12 ) of @xmath13  [ 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation , with competition between both pair breaking effects , has been studied first by bulaevskii  [ 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> his treatment was later generalized to arbitrary temperatures and d - wave superconductors by shimahara and rainer  [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> below the stability limit of the normal - conducting state , which will be referred to as @xmath11 , a series of different inhomogeneous superconducting states , depending on @xmath8 , appear . </S>",
    "<S> for s - wave superconductors each one of these states belongs to a particular value of landau s quantum number @xmath14 , which takes integer values @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> these states are ( for s - wave ) the following :    * the vortex state for small @xmath8 belongs to @xmath16 . * a series of inhomogeneous states for @xmath8 near @xmath17 , each one characterized by a single value @xmath18 , with @xmath14 increasing with increasing @xmath8 . * the fflo state for @xmath10 , which may be characterized by @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the higher landau level states , for @xmath18 , has been calculated recently for s - wave superconductors by minimizing the quasiclassical free energy  [ 7 ] . for d - wave superconductors  [ 6 ] </S>",
    "<S> a state below @xmath11 is no longer characterized by a single value of @xmath14 but rather by an infinite subset @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dominant contribution may still be characterized by a single number @xmath14 , which increases again with increasing @xmath8 and approaches infinity in the fflo limit . </S>",
    "<S> thus , basically the above classification scheme remains valid for d - wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundary of the ` pure ' fflo state for d - wave superconductors [ the curve @xmath21 has been calculated by maki and won  [ 4 ] .    the linearized gap equation to be solved </S>",
    "<S> is given by  [ 5,6 ] @xmath22 \\right][1 \\nonumber\\\\         </S>",
    "<S> - \\cos[s\\{\\mu_0h - \\frac{1}{2 } \\vec{v}_f^\\prime \\vec{\\pi}\\ } ] ] \\delta(\\vec{r } ) \\mbox{. } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider a cylindrical fermi surface , appropriate for the present two - dimensional problem , with the fermi velocity @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap parameter is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for s - wave , and @xmath26 for d - wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical momentum is defined by @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field @xmath28 is assumed to lie in the @xmath29-plane , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the following gauge for the vector potential : @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> paramagnetic pair breaking enters via the term @xmath33 in ( 1 ) ; the electron s magnetic moment is @xmath34 , with the lande factor @xmath35 and bohrs magneton @xmath36 . the method of reducing equation ( 1 ) to a set of algebraic equations follows exactly reference [ 6 ] and need not be repeated here . as a first check of our numerical method we compared our results with reference [ 6 ] and found complete agreement whenever the same set of input parameters was used .    </S>",
    "<S> let us proceed to a comparison of the solutions @xmath3 of equation ( 1 ) with the @xmath1 data reported in reference [ 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the first point to address is the independence of @xmath1 on the azimuthal angle @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> such a dependence may easily be incorporated in the present model by replacing @xmath37 in ( 1 ) by @xmath38 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> as long as orbital pair - breaking is present for a parallel field component , the symmetry - breaking term @xmath39 has to be kept in ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the other hand , complete decoupling of the ( infinitely thin ) conducting planes can be assumed , the term @xmath40 can be dropped and @xmath3 becomes independent of @xmath9 , as can be explicitely confirmed numerically . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we recall that a three - dimensional d - wave superconductor shows anisotropy of the upper critical field  [ 8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observed independence of @xmath1 on @xmath9 is in agreement with the present model and , in particular , with the assumption of quasi - two - dimensional superconductivity .    if @xmath41 is measured in units of @xmath5 and @xmath42 in units of @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the bcs - gap at @xmath45 ) , the present model requires only one single parameter @xmath46 to be fitted . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter is proportional to the `` bulk '' ratio of the orbital and spin critical fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively </S>",
    "<S> . in the present anisotropic model the actual ratio of spin and orbital pair - breaking depends on @xmath8 and may be written in the form @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit to the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath1 at @xmath50 ( see figure 4 of reference [ 3 ] ) has been obtained for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath46 is consistent with a critical temperature @xmath52 of the sample studied in reference [ 3 ] , and a fermi energy of the order of @xmath53 as estimated from several experiments  [ 9 ] . using this value we found very good agreement between @xmath54 and the data of reference </S>",
    "<S> [ 3 ] , as shown in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical curves in figure 1 have been calculated assuming d - wave symmetry ; the difference between d - wave and s - wave was found to be small except very close to @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> , as a function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> full squares : data of reference [ 3 ] at @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> full line : theoretical result for the bulaevskii - shimahara - rainer phase boundary for @xmath58 . dashed line : theoretical result for @xmath59.,width=491 ]    the @xmath1 data show a small but clearly visible kink near the plane - parallel orientation , at @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar feature is also found in the theoretical phase boundary @xmath61 , as shown in figure 1 ( where the square of the critical fields has been plotted in order to make this discontinuous change in slope better visible ) . </S>",
    "<S> this kink indicates the transition from the vortex state , with @xmath16 , to the first of the above mentioned fflo - precursor states , with @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> still closer to @xmath63 equation ( 1 ) yields additional transitions corresponding to @xmath64 , which are still visible in figure 1 in the theoretical curve but not in the data points . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath54-curves describing the @xmath65 transitions , for the same material but higher @xmath41 , are shown on a larger scale in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter structure of the precursor phases , where pairing takes place in landau levels @xmath18 , has been investigated recently for s - wave superconductors  [ 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> two types of such precursor states have been found : ( i ) quasi - one - dimensional states , which may be considered as a mixture of rows of vortices and one - dimensional fflo - type oscillations , and ( ii ) two - dimensional lattices with several zeros of the order parameter with different vorticity  [ 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> such unusual states [ of type ( ii ) ] have been predicted to occur in the extremely high field region where quantization of single electron levels becomes important  [ 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the present arrangement might provide a relatively feasible way of observing such vortex structures . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned , however , that for d - wave superconductors neither the equilibrium structure of the fflo state nor that of the @xmath18 states has been calculated so far .     of the upper critical field , as calculated from equation ( 1 ) , </S>",
    "<S> are plotted in more detail , using the same value of @xmath66 as in figure 1 but a higher temperature @xmath67.,width=491 ]    -dependence of the upper critical field of @xmath68 , as reported in reference [ 11 ] , with the solutions of equation ( 1 ) for s - wave superconductivity at @xmath69 and @xmath70.,width=491 ]    the shape of the @xmath61 curve depends distinctively on temperature , as shown by the plot ( dashed line ) of @xmath71 at @xmath59 in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this enhancement at higher @xmath41 is , of course , that paramagnetic pair breaking becomes less effective at higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> data at higher @xmath41 have not been reported in reference [ 3 ] but would be useful in order to check the present interpretation . looking for similar measurements we found old data by morris and coleman  </S>",
    "<S> [ 11 ] for intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide @xmath68 samples . in this material , which represents a nearly perfect realization of two - dimensional superconductivity , an unexplained anomaly with regard to the behavior of the upper critical field at different @xmath41 has been reported ( figure 10 of reference [ 11 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find excellent agreement ( see figure 3 ) comparing the data of reference [ 11 ] with the solutions of equation ( 1 ) for an s - wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> again , a single parameter has been adjusted ( @xmath72 ) to obtain both of the theoretical curves shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance data reported in reference [ 11 ] show a non - monotonic behavior near the plane - parallel field orientation ( see figure 3 of reference [ 11 ] ) , which may be due to transitions to the @xmath18 states . </S>",
    "<S> the latter states are discussed in more detail in reference [ 7 ] .     with the theoretical result reported in reference [ 4].,width=491 ]    finally , </S>",
    "<S> let us compare the measured temperature - dependence of @xmath1 for the plane - parallel field orientation ( figure 3 of reference [ 3 ] ) with @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> according to our interpretation of these data , the states below @xmath74 should be a d - wave version of the fflo state for @xmath75 , and the homogeneous superconducting state for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this phase boundary has been calculated first by maki and won  [ 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the shimahara rainer d - wave phase boundary must agree with reference [ 4 ] in the limit @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we found agreement , except for the steep rise of @xmath73 below @xmath78 reported in reference [ 4 ] ( a possible reason for this discrepancy may be slow convergence of our numerical method for low @xmath41 and high @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between theory  [ 4 ] and experiment  [ 3 ] depicted in figure 4 shows again fairly good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic difference in temperature variation above and below @xmath79 is visible in the data points , although it is less pronounced than in the theoretical curve . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in critical fields between s - wave and d - wave is again rather small ; at @xmath80 , the lowest temperature , where measurements for @xmath2 have been reported  [ 3 ] , both are approximately given by the standard @xmath81-result  [ 12 ] for the fflo state , @xmath82 , which exceeds the pauli limiting field by @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these numbers do also fit well into the fflo interpretation of the phase boundary for plane - parallel field orientation .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , the proposal of nam et al .  [ 3 ] </S>",
    "<S> that upper critical field data for a plane - parallel field orientation in the layered organic superconductor @xmath2 should be interpreted in terms of a fflo state , has been supported by our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the data agree with the predictions of a model of a quasi - two - dimensional superconductor both with regard to the angular and the temperature dependence of the critical field . </S>",
    "<S> further confirmation of this interpretation could be obtained by means of measurements at higher temperatures , where paramagnetic pair - breaking is strongly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> if this interpretation is correct , precursor states with interesting properties should appear for applied fields close to the plane - parallel orientation . </S>"
