    "the global , disk - averaged star formation rate @xmath4 and gas density @xmath5 in nearby galaxies are known to be well correlated , producing a simple power law called the schmidt law ; @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the determination of the index @xmath7 has been extensively studied , producing values between 1 and 2 .",
    "however , the density range at which this law holds for normal galaxies has not been studied as much .",
    "the lower density cutoff for the schmidt law has been argued by @xcite based on gravitational instability , giving a critical gas density of @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xmath10 where star formation is strongly suppressed below this limit . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been only marginal success for the observational consideration of the schmidt law at higher densities .",
    "this is primarily due to the limit in spatial resolution of co observations , where the @xmath1(j=1 - 0 ) emission at @xmath11=2.6 mm is used as a tracer of molecular gas .",
    "high molecular density regions are spatially small in general , owing to the molecular cloud s patchy structure and central condensation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to make co observations with smaller beam sizes ( higher resolution ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the schmidt law holds better when sampled within galaxies , using 45 arcsecond resolution data at the center of over 100 nearby galaxies ( see figure 11 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the densest gas in galaxies is normally confined to within a few hundred parsecs of the nucleus ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , 45 arcsecond resolution , which corresponds to kpc scales in nearby galaxies , is too large to consider the validity of the schmidt law at the highest densities .",
    "@xcite has shown that the schmidt law holds at higher densities if we include a sample of ir luminous starburst galaxies with @xmath12 to @xmath13 at high molecular densities . including this sample has extended the schmidt law up to an unchallenged value of @xmath14 ( see figure 6 in @xcite ) . however , ir luminous starbursts represent special physical conditions which display a systematic difference from normal spirals , and including this sample in considering the validity of the schmidt law may lead us to a misunderstanding of the physical properties which underly the poorly understood power law . @xcite",
    "have indeed found that the ir luminous galaxies with @xmath15 do display a systematic difference from normal galaxies in view of the schmidt law , in that the ratio of hcn to co rises abruptly for ir luminous galaxies compared to normal galaxies .",
    "exclusion of these ir luminous samples from kennicutt(1998 ) and the consideration of only normal spirals reveal that the law is only valid up to @xmath16 .",
    "other studies of the schmidt law at high densities involve hcn @xcite and higher transition emission such as @xmath1 ( j=2 - 1 ) as probes of hydrogen at higher densities , but the weakness of this emission and the difficulty in comparing @xmath5 derived from these probes and others of lower density ( such as co(j=1 - 0 ) and hi ) has limited the consistent consideration of the schmidt law s validity at a wide density range .    in order to approach to a more fundamental understanding of the relation between gas content and star formation , it is essential to know to what density the schmidt law holds for normal galaxies , or whether the simple power - law formulation of the schmidt law is valid at all .",
    "this will require that we use a consistent probe of the gas , at a wide density range .    in this study",
    ", we consider the validity of the schmidt law including densities above this limit by using recent high resolution single dish and interferometry observations .",
    "section 2 provides information on co and h@xmath0 data , and the procedures for calculating @xmath5 and @xmath4 . in section 3",
    "we show the result , and in section 4 we discuss the various uncertainties which relate to the schmidt law , and the validity of the schmidt law at high densities .",
    "conclusions will be given in section 5 ."

    "<S> we have combined h@xmath0 and recent high resolution @xmath1 ( j=1 - 0 ) data to consider the quantitative relation between gas mass and star formation rate , or the so - called schmidt law in nearby spiral galaxies at regions of high molecular density . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between gas quantity and star formation rate has not been previously studied for high density regions , but using high resolution co data obtained at the nma(nobeyama millimeter array ) , we have found that the schmidt law is valid at densities as high as @xmath2 for the sample spiral galaxies , which is an order of magnitude denser than what has been known to be the maximum density at which the empirical law holds for non - starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we obtain a schmidt law index of @xmath3 and roughly constant star formation efficiency over the entire disk , even within the several hundred parsecs of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that the physics of star formation does not change in the central regions of spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with starburst galaxies are also given . </S>",
