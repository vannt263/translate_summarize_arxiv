    "within the popular @xmath0cdm model for structure formation , massive galaxies are built up through the merger and accretion of smaller subsystems and through the smooth accretion of gas . under the assumption that at least some of the accreted satellites contain significant stellar components , one expects observable signatures of this process in the form of tidal streams and other stellar inhomogeneities . while such features have been previously found in our milky way , little has been known , until recently , about their frequency in other galaxies .",
    "one of the main goals of the isaac newton telescope wide - field camera ( int wfc ) survey of m31 @xcite has been to search for signatures of satellite disruption in the outer halo of our nearest giant neighbour .    during the past four years",
    ", we have used the int wfc to map @xmath1 40 sq .",
    "( 163 contiguous pointings ) around m31 with 8001200 sec exposures in the v and _ i _ passbands @xcite .",
    "this depth is sufficient to reach v@xmath2 , _",
    "i_@xmath3 , and hence probe the top three magnitudes of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "our current coverage extends to 4 degrees ( @xmath155  kpc ) and 2.5 degrees ( @xmath130  kpc ) along the major and minor axes respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the distribution of `` blue '' rgb stars across our survey area .",
    "as already apparent from our interim results @xcite , the distribution of giant branch stars at large radius is very far from uniform .",
    "many of the clumpy features visible in the stellar distribution have effective surface brightnesses @xmath4 mag sq .",
    "a value typically unobservable by traditional techniques but possible here due to the fact we are resolving individual stars at the bright end of the luminosity function .    the mere existence of stellar overdensities in the outskirts of m31 indicates an active accretion history , however many important questions remain .",
    "are the overdensities the result of many small accretions , or one large one ?",
    "how much of the structure is simply the result of a warped / perturbed outer disk ?",
    "what is the relationship between various stellar overdensities , such as a the giant tidal stream , and m31 s innermost satellites ? to address these issues , we are pursuing a comprehensive follow - up program consisting of a large radial velocity survey with keck  ii / deimos and a detailed stellar populations study with hst / acs .",
    "stellar kinematics at the distance of m31 can be probed directly through radial velocities of individual giant stars , or indirectly through tracer populations , such as planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "while pne have been used successfully to study the kinematics of the disk and inner halo ( e.g. @xcite ) , the efficiency of this technique declines rapidly in the low surface brightness outer regions .",
    "if one assumes the canonical @xmath5 pne per unit v - band luminosity @xcite then @xmath6 pne would be expected per square degree at @xmath7  mag sq .",
    "arcsec but only @xmath8 would be expected within the same area at @xmath9  mag sq .",
    "arcsec .",
    "blue  red giant branch stars in a @xmath10 square degree ( 125 x 95  kpc ) area centreed on m31 , as mapped with the int wfc . overlaid are the 30 keck / deimos pointings observed as of september 2003 ; these mainly target major regions of stellar substructure and a few locations in the far outer disk / inner halo .",
    "the three deimos fields of guhathakurta et al @xcite are shown as dashed rectangles.,width=302 ]    we have been conducting our radial velocity survey using the deimos multi - object spectrograph on the keckii  10 m telescope ( see figure [ fig1 ] for the pointings observed to date ) .",
    "our strategy involves both standard multi - slit masks , resulting in @xmath11 targets per @xmath12 deimos pointing , as well as the use of a custom - built narrow - band filter to limit wavelength coverage and increase multiplexing in high density regions , typically allowing @xmath13 targets per mask .",
    "we exploit the near - ir calcium ii triplet lines ( @xmath14 ) to provide information about both radial velocities ( typical uncertainty here 510  km / s ) and metallicities .",
    "full details of our survey strategy and results so far are given in @xcite .",
    "km / s.,width=415 ]    radial velocities for stars lying at four locations along the giant stellar stream were presented by @xcite and used in combination with distance data @xcite to place constraints on the orbit of the stream progenitor and on the total mass of m31 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows velocity histograms at these locations for stars with good s / n and good quality cross - correlation measurements .",
    "gaussians distributions have been used to describe the components attributed to the stream ( the dominant component in all fields significantly displaced from the inner halo ( i.e. s01 , s02 , s06 ) ) and the centroids and widths are indicated .",
    "note that considerably more stars are now present in s08 than in @xcite due to a reanalysis of the original data .",
    "a smooth gradient in both radial ( heliocentric ) velocity and line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( uncorrected for the instrumental errror ) is apparent along the stream .",
    "the measurements of @xcite for fields lying between s02 and s06 are fully consistent with these trends .",
    "the southern extent of the stream is essentially at rest with respect to m31 ( @xmath15  km / s ) and has the largest observed velocity dispersion ( @xmath16  km / s ) ",
    "these observations suggest this location is close to apocentre @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting progenitor orbit ( in the best - fitting potential , see @xcite ) is highly radial and viewed close to edge - on .",
    "it passes near the centre of m31 before looping around to a position north - east of the galaxy centre ( also supported by detailed studies of the stellar populations in these parts @xcite ) . before",
    "velocity data were available , a prime candidate for the progenitor was the compact de , m32 , which projects directly onto the stream , has a comparable line - of - sight distance and shares a similarily high metallicity .",
    "this association no longer appears likely however , since the radial velocity of m32 ( @xmath17  km / s ) is inconsistent with the expected velocity of the stream at this position in the current orbital phase ( @xmath18  km / s ) .",
    "similar arguments make an association with ngc  205 , m31 s second closest luminous satellite , equally unlikely .",
    "significant substructure has been identified along both the north - eastern and south - western major axes ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , termed the `` northern spur '' and the `` g1 clump '' respectively .",
    "these stellar overdensities are unlikely to be related to each other  for e.g. representing debris from a satellite orbiting within the disk plane  given the different colours exhibited by their constituent stellar populations @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] presents radial velocity histograms for these regions constructed from stars with good s / n measurements .",
    "the g1 clump , located at a radius of @xmath19  kpc , exhibits a clear velocity peak at @xmath20  km / s ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the g1 globular cluster , which is projected near the edge of the overdensity , has a sufficiently different radial velocity ( @xmath21  km / s ) , making it unlikely that the two are related .",
    "the northern spur region , located at a radius of @xmath22  kpc , exhibits a clear velocity peak at @xmath23  km / s . while it is tempting to associate the major axis substructures with the outer disk , we note that simple expectations for the disk velocity ( assuming v@xmath24  km / s , based on hi observations @xcite ) are @xmath25  km / s and @xmath26  km / s respectively for the clump and the spur  velocities which differ from those observed by @xmath27  km / s ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "our spectroscopic survey of rgb stars in the outkirts of m31 aims to constrain the nature and origin of the stellar substructure observed in these parts , and to quantify the kinematic and metallicity structure of the far outer disk and inner halo .",
    "our results so far have enabled m32 and ngc  205 to be ruled out as the progenitors of the giant stellar stream ; instead , they suggest an orbit which connects the stream to the diffuse overdensity located north - east of the galaxy centre .",
    "the kinematics of the substructure observed along the major axes defy easy interpretation at present .",
    "future observations of radial velocities in unperturbed regions of the m31 outer disk will be crucial .",
