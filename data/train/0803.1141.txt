    "since the discovery by montgomery and dyson that the pair correlation function of the non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function seems to be asymptotically the  same  as  that of the eigenvalues of a random matrix from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , the relationship between the theory of the riemann zeta function and the theory of random matrices has attracted considerable interest .",
    "this interest intensified in the last few years after keating and snaith @xcite compared the  moments of the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix from the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) with the  partly conjectural ",
    "moments of the  value distribution of the riemann zeta function along the critical line , and also found some striking similarities .",
    "these findings have sparked intensive further research .",
    "on  the one hand , there are now  a  number of new conjectures , derived from random matrix theory , about the moments  of the value distribution of the riemann zeta function and more general @xmath0-functions ( see the papers by keating and snaith @xcite as well as conrey , farmer , keating , rubinstein , and snaith @xcite and the references contained therein ) . on the other hand , various authors have investigated the moments and the correlation functions of the characteristic polynomial also for other random matrix ensembles ( see brzin and hikami @xcite , mehta and normand @xcite , strahov and fyodorov @xcite , gtze and ksters @xcite ) .",
    "a recurring phenomenon on the random matrix side is the emergence of the sine  kernel in the asymptotics of the correlation functions ( or shifted moments ) of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "for instance , for the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) ( see forrester @xcite or mehta @xcite ) , the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3 identity matrix and integration is with respect to the normalized haar measure on the group @xmath4 of @xmath3 unitary matrices ) satisfies @xmath5 for any @xmath6 .",
    "this can be deduced using standard arguments from random matrix theory ( see chapter 4 in forrester @xcite ) . more generally , using similar arguments",
    ", it can be shown that for any @xmath7 , the correlation function of order @xmath8 of the characteristic polynomial @xmath9 satisfies @xmath10 for any pairwise different @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the vandermonde determinant .",
    "for completeness , the proof of ( [ cue2 ] ) is sketched in appendix  b of this paper .",
    "similarly , for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) ( see forrester @xcite or mehta @xcite ) , the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial @xmath13 ( where @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3 identity matrix and @xmath14 denotes the gaussian unitary ensemble on the space @xmath15 of @xmath3 hermitian matrices ) satisfies @xmath16 for any @xmath6 ( see chapter 4 in forrester @xcite ) .",
    "also , an analogue of  ( [ cue2 ] ) holds as  well .",
    "even more , these results can be generalized both to the class of unitary - invariant matrix ensembles ( brzin and hikami @xcite , mehta and normand @xcite , strahov and fyodorov @xcite ) and  at least for the second - order correlation function  to the class of hermitian wigner ensembles ( gtze  and  ksters @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is noteworthy that the emergence of the sine kernel is universal , as it occurs in all the cases previously mentioned , irrespective of the particular details of the  definition of the random matrix ensemble .",
    "( more  precisely , the emergence of the sine kernel depends on the symmetry class of the random matrix ensemble .",
    "for instance , for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) on the space of real symmetric matrices , the asymptotics are different ; see brzin and hikami @xcite . )    in view of the above - mentioned similarities between random matrices and the riemann zeta function , it seems natural to ask whether there is an analogue of ( [ cue1 ] )  and  ( [ cue2 ] ) for the shifted moments of the riemann zeta function along the critical line .",
    "although we have the feeling that such analogues should be , we have not been able to find an explicit statement of such analogues in the ( extensive ! ) recent literature on the relationship between the theory of random matrices and the theory of the riemann zeta function .",
    "this seems somewhat surprising , particularly since there exist some more general results ( or conjectures ) from which an analogue of ( [ cue1 ] )  or  ( [ cue2 ] ) could be deduced rather easily , at least on a formal level .",
    "the main aim of this note is to fill this gap .",
    "more precisely , by an analogue of ( [ cue1 ] ) and ( [ gue1 ] ) , we mean a result of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are arbitrary real numbers , @xmath20 is a constant , and @xmath21 is some normalizing factor depending on @xmath22 . to account for our choice of scaling for the shift parameters @xmath18  and  @xmath19 , note that both in ( [ cue1 ] ) and in ( [ gue1 ] ) , the scaling factor is equal to the mean spacing of eigenvalues .",
    "for  instance , for a random @xmath3 matrix from the  cue , there  are @xmath23 eigenvalues distributed over the unit circle of length  @xmath24 , which gives rise to a  mean spacing of @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , for a random @xmath3 matrix from the  gue , it  is well - known that the mean spacing at the origin is @xmath26 ( see chapter  6 in mehta  @xcite ) .",
    "now recall that , if @xmath27 denotes the number of zeros of @xmath28 in the region @xmath29 , @xmath30 , it is known that @xmath31 ( see chapter  9 in titchmarsh  @xcite ) , so that the _ empirical _ mean spacing at location @xmath32 is @xmath33 . since this mean spacing depends on @xmath32 , it seems natural to multiply the shift parameters @xmath18  and  @xmath19 by  the _ location - dependent _ scaling factor @xmath34 .    for the shifted second moment of the riemann zeta function ,",
    "this result was obtained ( in a slightly different formulation ) already by atkinson @xcite in 1948 , and thus even before the sine kernel was `` discovered '' in random matrix theory .",
    "( curiously , this paper seems not to get cited in the recent literature on the interplay between random matrix theory and number theory . )",
    "atkinson s theorem can be restated as follows :    [ zeta2theorem ] for any @xmath20 and any @xmath6 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .    in particular , for @xmath40",
    ", this reduces to the classical result that @xmath41 ( see theorem  7.3 in titchmarsh @xcite ) .",
    "actually , atkinson s theorem states that for any @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is defined by the relation @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "however , as @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , it seems clear that theorem [ zeta2theorem ] is virtually the  same , and in fact this result can be established by the same proof as atkinson s theorem .    for the shifted fourth moment of the riemann zeta function , we have the following result , which constitutes an analogue of ( [ cue2 ] ) in the special case @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 :    [ zeta4theorem ] for any @xmath20 and any @xmath6 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 for @xmath37 and @xmath54 for @xmath39 .    in particular , for @xmath40",
    ", this reduces to the classical result that @xmath55 ( see theorem  b in ingham @xcite ) .    for the proof of theorem [ zeta4theorem ]",
    ", we will closely follow the proof of theorem  b in ingham @xcite .",
    "in particular , our proof is also based on the approximate functional equation for @xmath56 .",
    "( this is analogous to the proof of theorem [ zeta2theorem ] indicated above , which closely follows the proof of the corresponding result for the non - shifted second moment , starting from the approximate functional equation for @xmath57 . )    as pointed out by an anonymous referee , it should also be possible to deduce theorems [ zeta2theorem ] and [ zeta4theorem ] ( and even more precise versions involving information about the lower - order terms ) from the existing ( more general ) mean value theorems for the second and fourth moment of the riemann zeta  function with _",
    "constant _ shifts ( see theorem  a in ingham @xcite and theorem  4.2 in motohashi @xcite ) .",
    "however , we will not pursue this issue further here , since it is our main aim to point out that the highest - order terms of the appropriately shifted moments of the riemann zeta  function give rise to the sine kernel .",
    "furthermore , weighing the shifts with the  factor @xmath58 seems to simplify the problem , and we therefore think that our  independent ( and comparatively simple ) proof of theorem [ zeta4theorem ] might be of its  own  interest .    as regards the higher ( even ) shifted moments of the riemann zeta function along the critical line , we will show that a recent conjecture by conrey , farmer , keating , rubinstein , and snaith @xcite , when combined with our choice of scaling , gives rise to the following analogue of ( [ cue2 ] ) :    [ skc ] for any @xmath59 , for any @xmath20 and for any @xmath60 \\nu_1,\\hdots,\\nu_m \\in \\mathbb{r}$ ] , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the vandermonde determinant and @xmath63 the product being taken over the set @xmath64 of prime numbers .",
    "( naturally , in the case where two or more of the shift parameters are equal , the right - hand side should be regarded as defined by continuous extension , similarly as in the preceding theorems . )",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "thus , theorem  [ zeta2theorem ] confirms conjecture  [ skc ] in the special case @xmath67 , and theorem  [ zeta4theorem ] confirms conjecture  [ skc ] in the special case @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ cue2 ] ) and conjecture [ skc ] clearly have a similar structure .",
    "a notable difference is given by the factor @xmath71 which occurs in  conjecture [ skc ] for the riemann zeta function but not in  equation ( [ cue2 ] ) for the cue .",
    "it is well - known ( see keating and snaith @xcite and conrey , farmer , keating , rubinstein , and snaith @xcite ) that this `` arithmetic factor '' is not  predicted by random matrix theory .",
    "another difference is given by the sign in the phase factor @xmath72 .",
    "this difference could have been avoided if we had defined the characteristic polynomial by instead of .",
    "as already mentioned , apart from atkinson s theorem , we are not aware of explicit statements of _ continuous _ mean value theorems involving the sine kernel .",
    "this seems somewhat surprising , given that the choice of the shift parameters on the scale @xmath58 seems completely natural in view of the existing similarities to random matrix theory .",
    "in particular , this scaling also occurs in the pair correlation function of the zeros of the riemann zeta function ( see montgomery @xcite ) as well as in a number of _ discrete _ mean value theorems related to the zeros of the riemann zeta function ( see gonek  @xcite , hughes @xcite , mozer @xcite ) .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the following notation : let @xmath57 denote the riemann zeta function , which is defined by the dirichlet series @xmath73 for @xmath74 and by analytic continuation for @xmath75 , and let @xmath76 for any @xmath77 .",
    "we follow the convention of denoting the real and imaginary  part of the argument @xmath78 by @xmath79 and @xmath32 , respectively . furthermore , for any integer @xmath80",
    ", we  denote by @xmath81 the number of divisors of @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we make the convention that , unless otherwise indicated , the @xmath83-bounds occurring in the proofs may depend on @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( which are regarded as fixed ) but not on any other parameters .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  2 is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ zeta4theorem ] . in section  3",
    "we discuss the relationship between conjecture  [ skc ] for the higher ( even ) shifted moments of the riemann zeta function and the conjecture by conrey , farmer , keating , rubinstein , and snaith @xcite . finally , for the convenience of the reader , the appendices a  and  b contain some auxiliary results from analytic number theory and random matrix theory which have been used in the preceding sections .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ zeta4theorem ] is modelled on the proof of theorem  b in ingham  @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that for any @xmath6 , @xmath84 the assertion of theorem [ zeta4theorem ] then follows by using ( [ zeta4claim ] ) for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ,  and taking the  sum .    for the proof of ( [ zeta4claim ] ) ,",
    "we start from the approximate functional equation for @xmath88 ( see  theorem 4.2 in ivi @xcite ) , which states that for any @xmath89 , @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93",
    ". taking @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , it follows that @xmath97 using the functional equation @xmath98 ( see equation ( 1.23 ) in ivi @xcite ) and multiplying by @xmath99 , which is of order @xmath100 , we therefore obtain @xmath101 ( this is equation ( 4.11 ) in ivi @xcite . )    in the following , we will repeatedly use the fact that for any fixed @xmath102 , @xmath103 ( see equation ( 1.71 ) in ivi  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath104 using the approximation @xmath105 ( see equation ( 1.25 ) in ivi @xcite ) , it follows that @xmath106 using this equation for @xmath107 instead of @xmath32 , where @xmath108 is a fixed real number and @xmath32 is sufficiently large ( depending on @xmath109 ) , and using the straightforward estimate @xmath110 it finally follows that @xmath111 where @xmath112    now suppose that we can show that @xmath113 for any @xmath6 .",
    "it then follows by the cauchy - schwarz inequality that , for @xmath22 sufficiently large , @xmath114 and the theorem is proved .",
    "thus , it remains to prove ( [ approx41 ] ) . to begin with",
    ", we have @xmath115 and therefore @xmath116 an elaboration of the argument in ingham @xcite shows that the second integral on the right - hand side in  ( [ approx42 ] ) is of order @xmath117 and therefore tends to zero after  division by @xmath118 as in ( [ approx41 ] ) . indeed , from ( [ sdefinition ] )",
    ", we have @xmath119 for all @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 the derivatives of @xmath123 are given by @xmath124 and @xmath125 clearly , for @xmath22 sufficiently large ( depending on @xmath126 ) , @xmath127 for  all @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "hence , by lemma 4.4 in titchmarsh @xcite (=  lemma  [ bound2 ] ) , we  have the  estimate @xmath129 moreover , for @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "it follows that , for @xmath22 sufficiently large ( depending on @xmath126 ) , @xmath132 \\leq - \\tfrac{1}{2 } | \\log ( n / m ) |$ ] for  all @xmath133 .",
    "hence , by lemma 4.2 in titchmarsh @xcite (=  lemma  [ bound1 ] ) , we  have the estimate @xmath134 combining these two estimates and using lemmas b.3 and b.1 in ingham @xcite (=  lemmas [ sum4 ] and [ d2dsum ] ) , it follows that @xmath135 as claimed .",
    "thus , it remains to examine the first integral on the right - hand side in ( [ approx42 ] ) .",
    "to  begin  with , from ( [ sdefinition ] ) , we have @xmath136 for all @xmath120 , where @xmath137 now , for those pairs @xmath138 with @xmath130 , we find using integration by parts that @xmath139_{t = t'}^{t=2 t } + \\int_{t'}^{2 t } \\frac{(m / n)^{it}}{i \\log(m / n ) } \\\\ & \\qquad\\,\\cdot\\ , \\left ( 2\\pi m \\right)^{+\\tfrac{2\\pi i\\mu}{\\log t } } \\left ( 2\\pi n \\right)^{-\\tfrac{2\\pi i\\nu}{\\log t } } \\left [ \\frac{2\\pi i\\mu \\log(2\\pi m)}{t ( \\log t)^2 } - \\frac{2\\pi i\\nu \\log(2\\pi n)}{t ( \\log t)^2 } \\right ] \\ dt \\\\ & = \\myo \\left ( \\frac{1}{|\\log ( m / n)| } \\right ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last step uses the inequalities @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "hence , using lemma b.3 in ingham @xcite (= lemma  [ sum4 ] ) , it follows that @xmath142 so that the sum over the pairs @xmath138 with @xmath130 tends to zero after division by  @xmath118 as in ( [ approx41 ] ) .    consequently , to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the first integral on the  right - hand side in ( [ approx42 ] ) , it remains to consider the sum over the pairs @xmath138 with @xmath143 and to show that @xmath144 clearly , in doing so , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath145 .",
    "to evaluate the integral on the left - hand side in ( [ approx43 ] ) , write @xmath146 and note that for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , @xmath149 hence , since @xmath150 and @xmath151 , it follows that @xmath152 and therefore @xmath153 by lemma b.1 in ingham @xcite (= lemma [ d2dsum ] ) , we have @xmath154 thus , the @xmath83-term in ( [ approx45 ] ) is obviously of order @xmath117 . also , since @xmath155 for  @xmath156 , @xmath157 so that the second sum on the right - hand side in ( [ approx45 ] ) is also of order @xmath117 .",
    "thus , it remains to consider the first sum on the right - hand side in ( [ approx45 ] ) .",
    "similarly as in the proof of lemma b.1 in  ingham  @xcite , we can approximate this  sum by an integral . setting @xmath158 and using lemma [ d2sum ]",
    ", we have , for @xmath159 from a bounded set , @xmath160 substituting @xmath161 and @xmath162 yields @xmath163 and therefore @xmath164 thus , with @xmath109 replaced by @xmath165 , it follows that @xmath166 dividing by @xmath167 and taking real parts , we therefore obtain @xmath168 a direct calculation using the trigonometric identity @xmath169 yields @xmath170 this is true also for @xmath171 , provided that we consider the continuous extension of the right - hand side , 1/4 .",
    "this concludes the proof of  ( [ approx43 ] ) , and hence of theorem [ zeta4theorem ] .",
    "in this section we comment on the relationship between conjecture  [ skc ] for the  higher ( even ) shifted moments of the riemann zeta function and the conjecture by conrey , farmer , keating , rubinstein , and snaith @xcite , which we will simply call the cfkrs - conjecture from now on .    in the special case of the riemann zeta function ,",
    "this conjecture can be stated as follows :    [ cfkrs ] for any @xmath172 and any  @xmath11 , @xmath173 where @xmath174 here , @xmath175 denotes the subset of permutations @xmath79 of the set @xmath176 satisfying @xmath177 and @xmath178 < \\cdots < \\linebreak[1 ] \\sigma(2m)$ ] , and @xmath179 is a  certain function which is analytic in a  neighborhood of the origin and for which @xmath180 .    we will show that conjecture [ skc ] follows from the cfkrs - conjecture provided that one permits replacing @xmath181 with @xmath182 2\\pi \\nu_1/\\log t,\\hdots,2\\pi \\nu_m/\\log t$ ] . in this respect , conjecture [ skc ] may be regarded as a  special  case of the cfkrs - conjecture .",
    "similarly as in the proof of theorem [ zeta4theorem ] , we prefer working with the interval @xmath183 $ ] instead of @xmath184 $ ] . besides that , we will only consider the leading - order terms .",
    "we then have the approximation @xmath185 where we have put @xmath186 for @xmath187 , @xmath188 for @xmath187 , and @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the same as in the cfkrs - conjecture .",
    "alternatively , the approximation ( [ zetaf2 ] ) could be obtained by starting from the expression @xmath191 and by following the ( non - rigorous ) `` recipe '' leading to the cfkrs - conjecture .",
    "( in  fact , since the factor @xmath192 is essentially constant , it is irrelevant for the question which terms are rapidly oscillating and should therefore be discarded . )    to simplify ( [ zetaf2 ] ) as @xmath193 , recall that @xmath190 is regular at  @xmath194 and @xmath195 has a  simple pole with residual @xmath196 at @xmath197 .",
    "thus , concentrating on leading - order terms , we obtain @xmath198 therefore , since @xmath199 we should expect that @xmath200 since @xmath201 ( see equation ( 2.7.10 ) in @xcite ) and @xmath202 ( see equation ( [ cue6 ] ) in appendix  b ) , this yields conjecture [ skc ] .",
    "in this appendix , we state some estimates from the literature which have been used in the proofs of theorems [ zeta2theorem ] and [ zeta4theorem ] .",
