    "it has been long recognized that computational effort of grid - based quantum mechanical methods for nuclear dynamical problems grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this limits the size of systems that can be handled in an exact manner to those with 4 or less atoms .",
    "this is perhaps best illustrated in the field of reactive scattering experiments which have been limited to systems with 6d @xcite , but it is also clearly seen in other areas such as photodissociation processes .",
    "@xcite in light of this , considerable progress has been made in developing rigorous approaches for contracting the basis size required to perform such calculations .",
    "one such approach that has seen considerable success is the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree approach ( mctdh ) developed by meyer and co - workers@xcite that overcomes this limitation in a numerically exact way by expanding the time - dependent wave function in terms of a number of time - dependent configurations .",
    "@xmath0 in which the single particle ( or quasi - particle ) basis functions @xmath1 and the expansion coefficients are are coupled by the mctdh equations of motion .    for condensed phase systems and liquids path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) and centroid based molecular dyamics remain the method of choice .",
    "they have been extremely successful in calculating a wide variety of different thermodynamic properties of heavily quantum systems .",
    "@xcite despite the success of pimc approaches of late there are some inherent difficulties it faces .",
    "for instance , at low temperatures the amount of parameters that must be included can become prohibitive and lead to slow convergence .",
    "we present an approach which can model low temperature lennard - jones clusters with ease .",
    "the method developed herein develops along analogous lines to the mctdh approach and can be best thought of as an `` orbital '' free approach since we work entirely at the level of the nuclear @xmath2-body density .",
    "we do this by first writing the configurational density @xmath3 that describes the statistical likelihood of finding the system in a given multi - dimensional configuration @xmath4 as a superposition of statistical approximates @xmath5 that are joint probabilities for finding system at @xmath4 and that it is a variant of some statistical distribution described by the approximate .",
    "these approximates can be any elementary probability distribution function that can be specified in terms of its statistical moments , @xmath6 , the simplest of which for our purposes are multi - dimensional gaussians . in this case",
    ", we need to be able to specify @xmath7 variables corresponding to the elements of the covariance matrix , the central mean , and amplitude for @xmath8 @xmath9-dimensional gaussians .    explicit correlations between various degrees of freedom can be excluded in straightforward way by factoring the approximates .",
    "for example , if we factorize the full covariance matrix into individual atomic components , the configurational density can be cast in terms of the individual atomic densities @xmath10 we can then expand each atomic density @xmath11 as a linear combination of density approximates .",
    "@xmath12 this dramatically reduces the number of coefficients we need to determine to @xmath13 .",
    "intermediate factorization scheme yield similar scaling behavior allowing one to tune the computational complexity of the system depending upon the degree of correlation required by a particular physical problem .",
    "for example , one can define _ quasi - atoms _ by explicitly including covariance between the degrees of freedom of 2 or more atoms . as we shall derive next , each quasi - atom or atom will then _ evolve _ in the mean - field of the other quasi - atoms of the system .    in this paper , we present a grid - free adaptive hydrodynamic approach for computing the quantum ground - state density for a system of @xmath2 nuclei .",
    "our approach uses bayesian analysis to deduce from a statistical sampling of the density the best set of @xmath8 statistical approximates describing that density .",
    "we then use a quantum hydrodynamical scheme to move the sample points towards a minimal energy configuration . as proof of concept",
    "we consider the zero - point energy of small 4 and 5 atom clusters of argon and neon with pair - wise interatomic potential interactions .",
    "finally , we discuss how the approach may be used to develop new quantum - classical and fully quantum mechanical approaches for treating quantum mechanical solute particles ( such as an excess e@xmath14 or he atom ) in a liquid of classical or quasi - classical atoms ( such as ar or ne ) .",
    "we begin by writing the full many - body hamiltonian for the nuclear motion of a collection of atoms with pair - wise interaction potentials . @xmath15 where the first is the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual atoms and the second is the sum of the potential energy contributions . for an arbitrary @xmath2-body trial density , the energy functional is given by @xmath16 = t[n ] +   \\sum_{i\\ne j } \\int\\int n_i(r_i )",
