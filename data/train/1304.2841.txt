    "the main goal of high energy heavy - ion collisions is to create a deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) under extreme temperature and density conditions .",
    "jets produced in hard processes is a good probe to search for the formation of partonic matter and investigate its properties , because jets lose energy when they traverse the hot and dense medium  @xcite .",
    "the jet quenching phenomenon was first observed through the disappearance of away - side dihadron correlation with high @xmath2 leading triggered particle in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "recently , a large dijet transverse momentum asymmetry , through fully reconstructed jets , has been observed by the atlas and cms experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which is consistent with jet partonic energy loss in a qgp medium  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical efforts have been made to understand the dijet asymmetry mechanisms so far .",
    "casalderrey - solana @xmath3  @xcite proposed that frequency collimation can account for the main features seen in the medium - induced dijet asymmetry .",
    "qin and muller   @xcite reproduced dijet asymmetry with the medium modification of a partonic jet shower traversing in a hot qgp .",
    "young @xmath3  @xcite can fit the dijet asymmetry results with the parton radiative and collisional processes under a music hydrodynamic background with @xmath4= 0.25 - 0.3 .",
    "he @xmath3  @xcite studied the dijet asymmetry up to @xmath5 by including both initial- and final - state nuclear matter effects .",
    "renk  @xcite found that the energy dependence of the dijet imbalance is due to the kinematical collimation of jets and the increase in the production probability of quark jets with jet @xmath2 . in this work",
    ", dijet asymmetry is investigated within a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model .",
    "a large asymmetry of dijet is found to be produced by strong interactions between jet and partonic matter .",
    "in addition , the dijet asymmetry evolution functions are extracted to disclose how the dijet asymmetry evolves from the initial state to the final state through partonic jet energy loss .",
    "the ampt model with string melting scenario  @xcite , which has well described many experimental observables  @xcite , is implemented in this work .",
    "the ampt model includes four main stages of high energy heavy - ion collisions : the initial condition , parton cascade , hadronization , and hadronic rescatterings .",
    "the initial condition , which includes the spatial and momentum distributions of minijet partons and soft string excitations , is obtained from hijing model  @xcite .",
    "next it starts the parton evolution with a quark and anti - quark plasma from the melting of strings . the parton cascade process is simulated by zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) model  @xcite , where the partonic cross section is controlled by the value of strong coupling constant and the debye screening mass .",
    "though currently only including elastic parton collisions , the ampt model can still characterize @xmath6-jet imbalance at lhc  @xcite with quality similar to that of a linearised boltzmann transport model , which includes both collisional and radiative jet energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the ampt model recombines partons via a simple coalescence model to produce hadrons when the partons freeze - out .",
    "the dynamics of the subsequent hadronic rescatterings is then described by a relativistic transport ( art ) model  @xcite . in this work , the ampt model with the newly fitted parameters",
    "is used to simulate pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 = 2.76 tev , which has shown good descriptions for many experimental observables at lhc energy , such as pseudorapidity and @xmath2 distributions  @xcite and harmonic flows  @xcite .",
    "two sets of pb+pb simulations are performed by setting the partonic interaction cross sections as 1.5 and 0 mb , which correspond to two different physical scenarios for partonic + hadronic interactions and hadronic interactions only , respectively .",
    "because the dijet production cross section with large transverse momentum is very small , the dijet production with @xmath7 120 gev/@xmath8 is triggered in order to increase the simulation efficiency .",
    "several hard qcd processes are taken into account for the initial dijet production with the jet triggering technique in the hijing model  @xcite , which includes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , with consideration of initial- and final - state radiation corrections . an anti-@xmath15 algorithm from the standard fastjet package",

    "a pseudorapidity strip of width @xmath16=1.0 centered on the jet position , with two highest - energy jets excluded , is used to estimate the background (  average energy per jet area \" ) , which is subtracted from the reconstructed jet energy in pb+pb collisions .",

    "however , the following hadronization and hadronic rescattering processes do not seem to affect the formed @xmath1 distribution any more .",

    "because leading jets lose much less energy than subleading jets due to the dijet surface bias  @xcite , the dijet asymmetry should be dominantly controlled by the energy loss of subleading jets .",

    "the first one is the remaining @xmath1 part for which dijet keep their initial @xmath1 with a small jet energy loss fraction .",
    "the second one is the newly formed @xmath1 part for which jets lose much more energy to increase their original @xmath1 , which actually is the dominant source for the large dijet asymmetry in the central collisions .",
    "however , the contribution from the second source goes down in more peripheral collisions due to the decrease of partonic interaction strength , which results in less of a change of @xmath1 for more peripheral collisions .",

    "it shows that the final @xmath1 starts to increase from the initial @xmath1 and roughly scales with the energy loss fraction of subleading jet for a given initial @xmath1 selection .",
    "the small violation of scaling is because of the neglect of the energy loss fraction of leading jets in the reduction of the dijet @xmath1 evolution function .",
    "figure  [ fig - eloss ] shows that the event averaged energy loss fractions of jets , @xmath41 , actually increase with @xmath24 for both leading and subleading jets for both sets of ampt simulations .",
    "however , the leading jet loses less energy in comparison with subleading jet due to the dijet surface bias .",
    "in addition , the interactions between jets and partonic matter indeed can result in jet energy loss fractions larger than those between jets and hadronic matter .",
    "the reason the more central collisions show a lower @xmath29 in figure  [ fig - ajevoprojected ] at given @xmath30 and @xmath31 than peripheral collisions is because the leading jets do lose energy and energy loss increases with @xmath24 .",
    "in summary , dijet transverse momentum asymmetry is investigated within the ampt model with both partonic and hadronic interactions .",
    "it is found that a large dijet asymmetry can be produced by strong interactions between jets and partonic matter .",
    "hadronization and final - state hadronic rescattering have little effects on the dijet asymmetry .",
    "it is difficult for hadronic interactions only to reproduce the observed dijet asymmetry , since hadronic interactions make jets lose much less energy than partonic interactions .",
    "the @xmath1 evolution functions quantitively show that the final dijet asymmetry depends on both the initial dijet asymmetry and the jet energy loss .",
    "the large dijet asymmetry observed in central pb+pb collisions indicates a large jet energy loss in the hot and strongly interacting partonic medium created in these collisions .",
