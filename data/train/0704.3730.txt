    "directed networks that transport a resource , such as energy , from one or several sources to a large number of consumers are important in many areas of science @xcite . among such networks ,",
    "food webs provide an example of great interest , both from a purely scientific point of view , and because of their importance for nature - conservation efforts @xcite .",
    "although knowledge is rapidly accumulating about the _ structure _ of food webs @xcite , and static models have been developed to describe some of their statistical properties @xcite , we are as yet only beginning to develop an understanding of the processes by which such networks are formed and evolve under the influence of speciation , invasion , and extinction of interacting species @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the network structure of food webs is that they have degree distributions that generally decay quite fast with increasing degree  in most cases at least exponentially @xcite .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the class of networks known as scale - free , which have power - law degree distributions @xcite .",
    "while there has been a veritable explosion of research on scale - free networks , there has been no similar surge of interest in networks with rapidly convergent degree distributions .",
    "most food webs , and some ( but not all @xcite ) transportation networks , such as the north american power grid @xcite , and the european railway network @xcite belong to this class .",
    "much work remains to be done before a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which such networks evolve is reached .    as a step toward the development of such an understanding",
    ", we here propose a network growth scheme that produces a poissonian indegree distribution ( in food - web language : prey distribution ) and an outdegree ( predator ) distribution that is continuously tunable between an exponential distribution and a delta function .",
    "we note that these degree distributions do not agree with current food - web theory .",
    "in particular , the indegree distribution produced by the niche model @xcite has an exponential tail @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that models with an exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of species with lower or equal niche values are capable of producing food webs that are structurally in agreement with empirical data @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear why this condition is necessary or why schemes that invoke no physical mechanisms ( as in the niche model ) are able to produce such webs .",
    "therefore , other plausible schemes should also be explored .",
    "our model employs a scheme in which new nodes ( species ) attach to existing nodes with a preference for nodes @xmath0 with high indegree @xmath1 and low outdegree @xmath2 . in food - web terms , this corresponds to a prospective predator choosing prey that have a large number of resources ( represented by the large indegree ) , while the competition from previously established predators should be as small as possible ( low outdegree ) . among the influences on the network growth process mentioned above ( speciation , invasion , and extinction ) , we have thus chosen to focus on invasion and/or speciation . by ignoring extinction",
    ", we essentially model the early phase of steady network growth .",
    "the proposed growth process corresponds to a probability of attachment , @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "this attachment scheme is the direct opposite of the  rich get richer \" scheme of preferential attachment with an attachment probability proportional to the total degree @xmath5 , which is known to produce scale - free networks and has been studied in a myriad of variations over the last decade @xcite . to emphasize this difference",
    ", we shall call the scheme proposed here _ inverse preferential attachment_. [ we note that nonlinear forms of the  rich get richer \" scheme with a probability of attachment proportional to @xmath6 with @xmath7 have also been studied .",
    "however , except for @xmath8 , no @xmath7 leads to a power - law degree distribution @xcite . ]    in a previous paper @xcite , we studied a simplified version of the scheme proposed here , in which a new node makes a constant number of incoming links ( @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in this simplified version ,",
    "the probability of attachment , @xmath11 , depends only on the outdegree ( the number of predators ) .",
    "we calculated the outdegree distribution for this simplified model both analytically and by monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is given by the self - consistent equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represents the gamma function .",
    "in the present paper , we investigate the general form of the attachment probability presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) . with this form",
    "we relax both of the restrictions of the simplified model : we do not fix the indegree ( number of prey ) for the new nodes , so that each can make a different number of links , and we also vary the exponent @xmath15 .",
    "this makes full analytical treatment much harder , and the results for the outdegree distribution presented here are therefore only numerical .",
    "the indegree distribution , however , is found analytically to be a poissonian in the large - network limit .",
    "the generalized attachment process proceeds as follows .",
    "we start the growth process with @xmath16 nodes and assign each initial node an indegree @xmath17 .",
    "these nodes act as source nodes as they are not connected to any other node at the beginning . actually , the attributes of the initial nodes have no significance for the statistics because the final size of the network , @xmath18 , is much larger than @xmath16 . in each time step , we add a new isolated node .",
    "then , we give the new node @xmath19 chances to establish a link to an existing node with probability @xmath20 where @xmath21 with @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the number of existing nodes at that time step .",
    "we use @xmath23 in the denominator to prevent a divergence for @xmath24 .",
    "multiple links between two nodes are not allowed .",
    "the direction of a link is from the old node to the new one .",
    "we implement the growth process in monte carlo simulations as follows .",
    "we seed the system with @xmath16 source nodes , each with indegree @xmath19 , and introduce a new node in each monte carlo step . to create links between the new node and the existing ones , we pick existing nodes , @xmath25 one by one and calculate the probabilities of attachment , @xmath26 .",
    "then , we generate a random number , @xmath27 and attach the new node to node @xmath0 if @xmath28 .",
    "we repeat this procedure until all existing nodes in the network are tested , i.e. , till the sweep is completed . since @xmath29 , a new node makes on average one connection per sweep .",
    "we sweep the whole network @xmath19 times , so that @xmath30 .",
    "the new node is kept in the system , even if it does not acquire any links .",
    "however , a node with @xmath31 stays isolated throughout the growth since the probability of attachment to it is zero .",
    "we stop the growth when the network size @xmath22 reaches @xmath18 nodes with @xmath32 .",
    "we average over fifteen independent runs for each value of @xmath19 and @xmath15 .",
    "we first tested the case of @xmath10 to compare the outdegree distribution of the full @xmath33 model to the outdegree distribution of our simplified @xmath34 model , eqs .",

    "[ fig : gamma1-out ] , the outdegree distribution for the @xmath33 model also decays faster than exponentially for large @xmath35 .",
    "however , the dependence on the variable indegree leads to a broadening of the outdegree distribution : decreased probabilities for @xmath38 , and compensating increased probabilities for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the limit of large @xmath19 , the central part of the outdegree distribution of the @xmath33 model approaches that of the @xmath34 model .",

    "[ fig : gamma1-in ] ) . this can be shown as follows .",
    "each new node makes one link per sweep on average . when @xmath54 , each existing node has a probability equal to @xmath55 of acquiring a new link per sweep on average , independent of the history of the network .",

    "thus , the final indegree distribution is an average ( ignoring the @xmath16 initial nodes ) , @xmath61 in general , this can not be calculated exactly .",
