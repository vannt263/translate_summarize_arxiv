    "painlev equations are six second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations first studied by painlev and his colleagues around 1900 .",
    "they are well known for the so - called painlev property , i.e. , the only movable singularities of their solutions are ( finite order ) poles ; see @xcite . here",
    "` movable ' means the location of the singularities ( which in general can be poles , essential singularities or branch points ) of the solutions depend on the constants of integration associated with the initial or boundary conditions of the differential equations .",
    "the solutions of these equations , often called the painlev transcendents @xcite , in general can not be represented in terms of elementary functions or known classical special functions .",
    "they play important roles in both pure and applied mathematics , and are widely thought of as the nonlinear counterparts of the classical special functions .    for the first two painlev equations",
    "@xmath1 all solutions are meromorphic in the complex plane with @xmath2 being the only essential singularity .",
    "the locations of the movable poles for the painlev transcendents are crucial for understanding a number of problems arising from mathematical physics ; cf .",
    "@xcite . in the pioneering works @xcite ,",
    "boutroux established the `` deformed '' elliptic function approximations in appropriate sectors near infinity , which leads to the degeneration of lattices of poles along the critical rays @xmath3 where @xmath4 this means that the poles tend to align themselves along certain smooth curves which tend to one of the rays @xmath5 near infinity .",
    "furthermore , boutroux also showed the existence of solutions which have no lines of poles near infinity near @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) of the critical rays @xmath5 , which are called @xmath6-truncated solutions .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath8- or @xmath9-truncated solutions is , as confirmed by numerical studies in @xcite , that the distributions of poles near infinity characterize the global behavior of the poles .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath10 be the sector bounded by two consecutive critical rays : @xmath11 the following conjecture was made in @xcite by novokshenov :    [ conj ] if the @xmath8- or @xmath9-truncated solution of painlev equation has no pole at infinity in a sector @xmath10 , then it has no poles in the whole sector @xmath10 .    for the @xmath9-truncated solutions of pi ,",
    "a special case of this conjecture is known as dubrovin s conjecture , which appeared in @xcite with connections to the critical behavior of the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "it was proved recently in @xcite with a technique developed in @xcite ; see also @xcite for partial results .    in this paper",
    ", we will further improve the technique in @xcite ( see also a recent work @xcite for other improvements of @xcite ) and give an analytic proof of conjecture [ conj ] in the context of a special @xmath8-truncated solution of pii , namely , the hastings - mcleod solution @xcite .",
    "this solution might be the most famous one among the painlev transcendents , due to its frequent appearances in applications , especially in mathematical physics .",
    "for instance , the cumulative distribution function of the celebrated tracy - widom distribution @xcite admits an integral representation involving the hastings - mcleod solution .",
    "it is noted that the tracy - widom distribution is also applied to describe the length of the longest increasing subsequence in random permutations @xcite .",
    "another application is the appearance of @xmath12 functions associated with hastings - mcleod solution in building new universality class of limiting kernel for certain critical unitary random matrix ensembles @xcite ; see also @xcite for a nice review of this aspect and @xcite for its more recent applications related to non - intersecting brownian motions .",
    "our main result is stated in the next section .",
    "the hastings - mcleod solution @xmath13 is a special solution of with @xmath14 , i.e. , it satisfies the equation @xmath15 the solution @xmath13 is known to be pole - free on the real axis ( @xcite ) , and has the following asymptotics : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the usual airy function @xcite .",
    "a plot of @xmath18 for real @xmath19 is shown in the left picture of figure [ fig : hm ] .",
    "the locations of poles for @xmath13 is illustrated in the right picture of figure [ fig : hm ] .",
    "the six dashed lines are the critical lines defined in , and it is clear from the picture that all the poles are located in the sectors @xmath20 , which is consistent with conjecture [ conj ] .    our main result is stated as follows .",
    "[ main-1 ] the hastings - mcleod solution @xmath13 of the second painlev equation is pole - free in the region @xmath0\\cup [ \\frac{2\\pi}{3},\\frac { 4 \\pi}{3}]$ ] .    for @xmath21 large enough ,",
    "a partial result was shown in @xcite via the riemann - hilbert approach ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 11.1 and 11.7 ) .",
    "a more recent progress toward this result was obtained by bertola in @xcite , where he showed that @xmath13 is pole - free in the sector @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "his proof is based on the representation of the hastings - mcleod solution in terms of the second logarithmic derivative of the fredholm determinant of a certain integral operator and an operator - norm estimate .",
    "in contrast , our method is based on a direct analysis of , and it can be applied to other equations including the general pii equation with @xmath22 .",
    "although our method works for both of the two sectors @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] , we shall focus on the sector @xmath23 $ ] and briefly mention the ideas of proof for the sector @xmath24 $ ] , as the desired result about this sector was already shown in @xcite ; see section [ sec : proofs ] below .",
    "we first note that @xmath25 is also a solution to ( [ eq : p2 ] ) .",
    "this , together with the fact that @xmath13 is real on the real line and uniqueness of the solution , implies that @xmath26 .",

    "this shows that @xmath13 is pole - free in both @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and hence in @xmath32 .    the main challenge of the proof is to find an effective quasi - solution approximation of the hastings - mcleod solution which has sufficient accuracy for both small and large @xmath21 .",
    "this requires comprehensive knowledge of the asymptotics of the solution near infinity . to this end , we mention the following asymtotics of hastings - mcleod solution relevant to our proof ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.7 ) and @xcite ) .",

    "we emphasize two features of the asymptotics in proposition [ prop : asy ] :    * the asymptotics is valid along the critical line @xmath41 ( i.e. , the boundary of the relevant sector ) , where the asymptotics is oscillatory . * the hastings - mcleod solution @xmath13 is characterized by either of the two asymptotic relations and . indeed",

    "* chapter 11 ) .",
    "as we shall see later , the construction of quasi - solutions in the regions away from the origin is based on these asymptotic behaviors .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the analysis of @xmath13 in @xmath30 is accomplished in section [ sec : left ] . to get a concrete estimate of the initial values of @xmath13 at @xmath42",
    ", we will also need to study @xmath13 along @xmath43 before we are able to construct a quasi - solution in @xmath31 , which is carried out in sections [ sec : farright ] and [ sec : origin ] .",
    "analysis in @xmath31 is accomplished in section [ sec : left0 ] .",
    "we conclude this paper with the proofs of our main results in section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "we start with the analysis of the pii equation ( [ eq : p2 ] ) in the region @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",

    ", we will prove the above result by constructing a pole - free quasi - solution to pii , and showing that the difference between the quasi - solution and the hastings - mcleod solution is bounded .",
    "our construction of this quasi - solution is motivated by asymptotic expansions with exponential sums studied in @xcite , which suggests that we make the following change of variables : @xmath47{3t}}{2}h(t).\\label{eq : changev1}\\ ] ] this brings ( [ eq : p2 ] ) into the normalized form @xmath48 and the region of interest in proposition [ prop : farleft ] corresponds to @xmath49 in the new variable @xmath50 .",

    "this is also consistent with the fact the painlev equations admit a one - parameter family of solution represented by the sum @xmath57 which was found by boutroux @xcite , and particularly this includes @xmath13 as a special case of pii . since we only need to prove @xmath51 is pole - free in @xmath58 , we do not need to consider full expansions .",
    "instead , we will only show the existence of a decomposition with @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a constant related to the quasi - linear stokes multiplier @xmath40 ; see below .",

    "we intend to prove existence of a solution @xmath53 by showing that @xmath67 is a contractive map in a suitable banach space .",
    "the expressions of @xmath68 and @xmath69 indicate that it is necessary to estimate generalized exponential integrals in the complex plane . for this purpose",
