    "hints of direct detection of dark matter ( dm ) currently exist from two experiments .",
    "there is a long - standing observation of an annual modulation in the signal observed by dama @xcite , whose statistical significance is beyond question .",
    "last year the cogent experiment reported excess events in their lowest electron energy bins @xcite , followed more recently by a @xmath2 detection of annual modulation in the signal @xcite . under the simplest assumptions about the nature of the dark matter interactions ,",
    "these two observations appear to be incompatible with each other @xcite and with upper limits obtained by other experiments , especially cdms @xcite , xenon10 @xcite and xenon100 @xcite .",
    "channeling of recoiling ions along the crystal planes in the detectors has been suggested as one loophole for reconciling the conflicts , but this has been argued to be too small an effect by ref .",
    "uncertainties in quenching factors can also be used to help reconcile the two positive detections @xcite .",
    "there are alternative microphysical ways of ameliorating the tensions that have been explored in recent papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one important modification is to allow for isospin - violating interactions of the dark matter with nucleons , since the coherent spin - independent matrix element is a sum over the interactions with protons and neutrons : _",
    "n ~(f_p z + f_n ( a - z))^2 _ n where @xmath3 are the number of nucleons and protons in the nucleus , respectively , and @xmath4 are the respective cross sections for dm scattering on neutrons and the nucleus . if isospin is conserved then @xmath5 , but if @xmath6 , the limits placed on @xmath7 by the xenon experiments are greatly relaxed @xcite .",
    "moreover , several groups have indicated that inelastic scattering @xcite of dm with a small mass splitting @xmath8 kev can have a beneficial effect either for the the agreement between dama and cogent @xcite , the conflict between cogent and cdms @xcite , the goodness of fit to the cogent modulated signal alone @xcite , or marginally the overall goodness of fit to all data @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we look for the simplest and most natural kind of models that could accommodate these two generalizations , isospin violation and inelasticity , with an emphasis on hidden sector models with higgs or gauge kinetic portals to the standard model .",
    "( for previous model building efforts which do not focus on these aspects , see references @xcite-@xcite . ) a similar study to the present one was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but considering more elaborate models than we examine here .",
    "our inelastic model also has elements in common with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , although the latter incorporated neither isospin violation nor inelasticity .",
    "( see @xcite for another recent isospin - violating model . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , isospin violating couplings of a single vector were obtained through a combination of kinetic mixing and mass mixing with the @xmath9 .",
    "we will argue that interference between two new vector mediators is an elegant way of getting isospin violation if one demands that only inelastic scattering takes place .",
    "it is well known that dirac states coupling to vectors become off - diagonal in the mass eigenstate basis if small majorana masses are introduced @xcite .",
    "thus it is not challenging to account for the inelastic nature of the couplings .    on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite finds that inelasticity improves the global fit to the data only moderately , so that one might also contemplate models with no dm mass splitting and purely elastic scattering .",
    "the overall fit is in fact not very good , indicating either that some of the data have inconsistencies or that the dark matter interpretation is not correct . in this work",
    "we will assume the former , in which case one might be motivated to consider inelasticity as a secondary criterion , which might or might not survive as the data improve . accordingly , we consider both elastic and inelastic models in the following and leave it to the reader to judge how strongly the latter is preferred by the data .",
    "elastic scattering naturally arises in alternative models where the isospin violation comes about by interference between vector and scalar exchange .",
    "we will construct our models for isospin - violating dark matter starting with this simpler possibility , showing why it does not naturally accommodate inelastic couplings .",
    "a natural way to induce scalar - mediated interactions between the dark sector and the standard model ( sm ) is to introduce a new higgs field @xmath10 that is a singlet under the sm gauge group , and communicates to the sm through the interaction @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath10 gets a vev then the mass eigenstates are admixtures of @xmath10 and @xmath12 with mixing angle @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stand for the mass eigenvalues ( we assume small mixing , @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 is the sm higgs vev . if the dm @xmath17 has a yukawa coupling @xmath18 , then @xmath10 mediates interactions with sm fermions @xmath19 with the strength @xmath20 , assuming that @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is the sm yukawa coupling of the higgs to fermion @xmath19 .    in this scenario , @xmath10 couples to sm matter proportionally to @xmath12 .",
    "although these couplings violate isospin , it is a very small violation when it comes to scattering on nuclei , because nucleons get almost none of their mass from the valence quarks .",
    "the couplings of the higgs to nucleons are dominated by the sea - quark and gluon content , which are the same for neutrons and protons ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we get no significant isospin violation from couplings mediated by the higgs portal : it has @xmath5 .",
    "if in addition we invoke a gauge kinetic mixing portal , @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 and @xmath9 are the respective field strengths of the sm hypercharge and the hidden sector u(1)@xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the weinberg angle ) , then interference between the new vector and the new higgs does lead to tunable isospin violation .",
    "this is because the vector only mixes significantly with the photon , leading to @xmath27 .",
    "of course , this is not the ratio we need for dama and cogent .",
    "but interference between the vector and scalar exchange allows for any desired value .",
    "if @xmath28 is the new u(1)@xmath25 gauge coupling to the dm , then [ frat ] where @xmath29 is the coupling of @xmath12 to the nucleon : @xmath30 in terms of the nucleon mass @xmath31 and the higgs vev @xmath32 @xcite .    the main objection to this scenario arises if we want the couplings to dm to also be inelastic .",
    "suppose there are two mass eigenstates @xmath33 with masses @xmath34 split by the small amount @xmath35 .",
    "let us first write down an effective potential : v = _ |_m _ _ + 12 m^2_z z^2 + 12 m^2_^2 + g|_+ z _ - + y |_+ _ - [ scalarv ] ( it is also understood that @xmath9 couples to the electromagnetic current with strength @xmath36 and @xmath10 to the sm fermions @xmath19 with strength @xmath37 . )",
    "the mass splitting can arise by spontaneous symmetry breaking through couplings of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the weyl components in the original lagrangian , and @xmath10 carries twice the u(1)@xmath25 charge of @xmath17 .",
    "the troublesome question is how the scalar interactions came to be purely off - diagonal in the mass eigenbasis , given that @xmath10 has a vev which is needed in order to mix with the sm higgs @xmath12 .",
    "to arrive at ( [ scalarv ] ) , there must have been a bare mass term @xmath40 ( here expressed in the mass eigenbasis ) that was exactly canceled by @xmath41 . in the absence of this tuning",
    ", @xmath10 will have diagonal plus off - diagonal couplings , and this presents a complication for getting the desired level of isospin violation , since the interference between @xmath10 and @xmath9 only occurs in the inelastic channel .",
    "this is because the majorana vector couplings are purely off - diagonal ( see the following subsection ) .",
    "we do not contemplate this finely - tuned situation any further .",
    "however if instead of couplings of the form @xmath42 in which @xmath10 must carry a compensating charge , we have the interactions |(m+y ) in terms of a dirac fermion @xmath17 , then @xmath17 remains dirac after @xmath10 gets its vev , and there is no mass splitting .",
    "@xmath10 can interfere with @xmath9 through the purely elastic couplings . even though we must invoke an additional singlet higgs @xmath43 to break the u(1)@xmath25 symmetry , since now @xmath10 is neutral under u(1)@xmath25 , this is still an economical model , whose consequences we will consider . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath10 to be real .",
    "we do not consider the case of a pseudoscalar ( @xmath44 ) coupling because this leads to a nuclear scattering amplitude that is suppressed by the dm velocity , making it more difficult to interfere with the vector exchange contribution to get the desired isospin violation ( since the latter has no such velocity suppression ) .",
    "in contrast to the couplings of a scalar to dm , the purely off - diagonal coupling of the gauge field is natural if @xmath33 are majorana fermions that originated from a dirac particle before spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "consider the interactions ( again in the model where @xmath10 carries two units of the @xmath17 charge ) v = 12 |_m _",

    "when @xmath10 gets a vev , the mass matrix becomes (    cc & m + m &    ) which is diagonalized by @xmath48 with mass eigenvalues @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "if the u(1)@xmath25 interaction was orginally vector - like , then it becomes exactly off - diagonal in the mass basis because there is no vector current for a single majorana state .",
    "this is a strong motivation to prefer vector mediators if we aim for both isospin violation and inelastic off - diagonal couplings .",
    "the previous discussion motivates us to build a model in which the interfering scalar current is replaced by another vector current .",
    "the new vector need only couple to isospin differently from the kinetically mixed u(1 ) that has @xmath27 .",
    "coupling to @xmath51 is attractive from the point of view of anomaly cancellation , but such couplings are very strongly constrained because of the leptonic interactions ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest possibility that avoids these constraints is coupling to @xmath52 alone .",
    "u(1)@xmath53 is anomalous and it also has mixed anomalies with the sm gauge groups , that can be canceled by adding the appropriate exotic heavy particles @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we will not discuss the implications of these new particles further here , although they can provide complementary collider signatures to test the model .",
    "our addition of a single vector - like dm particle coupling to @xmath52 does not spoil the anomaly cancellation achieved in these models .",
    "we refer to the u(1)@xmath53 gauge boson as @xmath54 and for simplicity assume that it couples with equal strength @xmath55 to the dm and to the sm baryons",
    ". it also couples with equal strength to protons and neutrons , just like the singlet higgs of the previous section .",
    "therefore it is clear that ( [ frat ] ) is replaced by [ frat2 ]    this model is almost complete , but we have accounted for the breaking of only one linear combination of the two new u(1)s through the vev of @xmath10 .",
    "notice that @xmath10 must have charges @xmath56 under @xmath57 in order for ( [ lagrangian ] ) to be gauge invariant . to completely break the symmetry",
    "we need another field @xmath43 with different charges .",
    "this means that the mass eigenstates for the gauge bosons are generally admixtures of the original fields , and that both will therefore kinetically mix with the sm hypercharge .",
    "we need to clarify the relation between the couplings appearing in ( [ frat2 ] ) and the original lagrangian parameters .",
    "a simple way to ensure that the above relations are approximately correct despite mixing of the new gauge bosons is to assume that @xmath58 , by assigning @xmath43 the charges @xmath59 such that @xmath60 . in that case",

    "@xcite appeared , which considers a similar class of models .",
    "* note added : * after completing this work we became aware of refs.@xcite showing that pamela antiproton constraints are in conflict with a @xmath52 vector boson of mass greater than @xmath181 , which would favor the lower-@xmath119 parts of the contours of fig .",
    "in addition , we discovered that the gauge boson mixing angle effects in the present model can not be ignored even when @xmath105 is small , due to the occurrence of @xmath182 in the amplitudes , which scales as @xmath183 .",
    "this can be overcome by introducing an additional contribution to @xmath119 .",

    "<S> we point out challenges for building reasonable models and identify the most promising scenarios for getting isospin violation and inelasticity , as indicated by some phenomenological studies . if inelastic scattering is demanded , we need two new light gauge bosons , one of which kinetically mixes with the standard model hypercharge and has mass @xmath0 gev , and another which couples to baryon number and has mass @xmath1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> their interference gives the desired amount of isospin violation . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter is nearly dirac , but with small majorana masses induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking , so that the gauge boson couplings become exactly off - diagonal in the mass basis , and the small mass splitting needed for inelasticity is simultaneously produced . </S>",
    "<S> if only elastic scattering is demanded , then an alternative model , with interference between the kinetically mixed gauge boson and a hidden sector scalar higgs , is adequate to give the required isospin violation . in both cases , </S>",
