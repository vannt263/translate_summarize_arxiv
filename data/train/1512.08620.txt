    "since numerous years the visualization of flow fields has had a significant impact on the systematic understanding and development of fluid - dynamic models as well as on the calibration and verification of computational methods .",
    "while traditional experimental techniques were able to provide only partial information about the flow field , novel measurement techniques such as particle tracking , tomographic particle imaging , or magnetic resonance velocimetry deliver spatially resolved three - dimensional velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "these new methods therefore allow to image complex flow patterns in a wide range of engineering applications and even in biological in - vivo studies .    distributed flow measurements provide valuable information about simple and complex flows , but they are typically contaminated by measurement errors which limit their usability in practice to some extent . in order to make the flow measurements more suitable for further analysis , e.g. , for model discrimination or for the assessment of derived quantities like pressure drop or wall shear stress , some sort of data post - processing is required @xcite .",
    "a widely used technique is _ data smoothing _ which can be accomplished , for instance , by tikhonov regularization @xcite given by @xmath0 here and below @xmath1 denotes the flow measurements and the minimizer will be the enhanced velocity field .",
    "note that the penalization of the gradient term leads to a smoothed reconstruction and the choice of the regularization parameter @xmath2 allows a certain trade - off between smoothness and fit to the data .",
    "the underlying quadratic minimization problem can be solved efficiently by fourier transform or multigrid iterative solvers which makes this filter very efficient in practice .",
    "note that the above procedure and also various other imaging methods @xcite successfully reduce high frequency components in the noisy measurements but do not utilize any information about the underlying physics .",
    "in many applications , the fluid under consideration is incompressible and one might want to incorporate such prior knowledge into the reconstruction process . requiring the improved velocity field to be divergence free and using a smoothing procedure similar to above , we obtain a constrained minimization problem of the form    @xmath3    this quadratic minimization problem can again be solved efficiently by iterative methods . various computational strategies leading to related divergence free reconstructions have been investigated recently in the literature under the name _ divergence - free _ or _ solenoidal filtering _ ; see e.g. @xcite . let us note that , although some noise reduction has been observed even for the case @xmath4 , the divergence constraint alone does not formally guarantee smoothness of the reconstruction .",
    "this can be seen from the helmholtz decomposition of vector fields @xcite and will be illustrated by numerical tests below .",
    "a natural extension of the solenoidal filtering approach , which takes into account only the mass conservation , would be to incorporate also a model for the momentum balance into the reconstruction process .",
    "since distributed measurement techniques typically acquire time averaged data , it seems reasonable to assume steady flow conditions and to consider , as a first step , the stationary navier - stokes equations as the governing physical model .",
    "the reconstruction could then be defined via    @xmath5    here and below @xmath6 denotes the constant viscosity parameter .",
    "in addition to the differential equations , appropriate boundary conditions have to be specified .",
    "the residual @xmath7 in the momentum equation serves as a measure for the deviation from the idealized flow model due to unmodeled effects like time dependence or non - newtonian behaviour .",
    "since a prescribed flow model is satisfied by the reconstructed fields , one may call such an approach a _ fluid - dynamically consistent _ filter . due to the presence of the flow model",
    ", the reconstruction will be smooth automatically and no additional penalization of the velocity gradients is required .",
    "moreover , some information about the pressure is obtained .",
    "the system  has the form of an optimal control problem governed by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "such problems have been investigated extensively in the literature ; see e.g. @xcite for steady and @xcite for unsteady flow .",
    "note that the nonlinearity in the momentum equation poses severe challenges , both , for the analysis and for the numerical solution .",
    "it is well - known , for instance , that the navier - stokes system admits a unique solution only for sufficiently small data @xcite . moreover , due to the nonlinear constraints , the optimization problem  is non - convex and may have many local minima .",
    "both aspects make the computational solution demanding or even infeasible .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore propose a strategy that allows us to take advantage of the benefits and at the same time to overcome the drawbacks in the previous approach .",
    "the basic step is to use the distributed velocity measurements in order to replace the nonlinear term in the momentum equation by some linearization ; one may think of @xmath8 as an approximation for @xmath9 , although such a simple choice would not yield a well - posed problem in general due to lack of smoothness in the data .",
    "however , a proper linearization of the convective term will @xmath9 allow us to replace the nonlinear problem  by a linear quadratic optimal control problem with a unique minimizer that can be computed efficiently .",
    "the use of the distributed measurements in the governing equations is closely related to the _ equation error method _ , which is well - established in the context of parameter estimation @xcite . in summary",
    "we thus obtain a well - posed and analyzable reconstruction method that produces a smooth divergence free velocity field and a corresponding pressure distribution which together approximately satisfy the prescribed fluid - dynamic model and at the same time agree well with the measurements . a proper choice of the regularization parameter",
    "@xmath2 will allow us to find a good balance between data fit and model errors .",
    "the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] , we introduce the linearized fluid flow model underlying our reconstruction approach and we formulate appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we then establish the well - posedness of the linearized flow problem and derive error estimates for the linearization procedure . in section  [ sec : method ] , we introduce the linearized optimal control problem which is the mathematical formulation of our reconstruction procedure . we prove existence and uniqueness of minimizers , provide some error estimates , and highlight a direct connection to the solenoidal filtering .",
    "our approach is formulated in infinite dimensions and some discretization strategy is required in order to obtain implementable algorithms . in section  [ sec : realization ] , we therefore outline the systematic discretization by finite element methods and we briefly discuss efficient strategies for the numerical solution of the discretized optimal control problem .",
    "the viability of our approach is illustrated in section  [ sec : computation ] by some computational tests in which we also compare with the smoothing and the solenoidal filtering approaches outlined above .",
    "the presentation concludes with a short summary and a discussion of open problems and possible directions for further research .",
    "let us first introduce the linearized flow model that is used as a constraint in the reconstruction process and establish its well - posedness .",
    "we use the fact that the true flow field satisfies a model of similar structure and derive some perturbation error estimates . for illustration",
    ", we discuss in some detail the poiseuille flow between two parallel plates .",
    "we start with fixing the geometric setting we have in mind .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath11 be some bounded lipschitz domain .",
    "we assume that the boundary @xmath12 is piecewise smooth and can be split into three distinct parts @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "one may think of a channel where @xmath14 is the inflow , @xmath15 the outflow , and @xmath13 the wall of the channel .",
    "the key step in our approach is to replace the nonlinear convective term in by an appropriate linearization . for this , we make use of the following identity .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be two smooth vector fields and @xmath19 . then @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 by definition .",
    "throughout we use bold symbols to denote vector valued functions and spaces of such functions .    for an incompressible fluid",
    ", we can then express the convective term @xmath9 equivalently by @xmath23 .",
    "such a form of the convective term is sometimes employed in the design and analysis of numerical methods for incompressible flow . using the velocity measurements to replace one of the functions in either of the quadratic terms , we obtain @xmath24 as an approximation .",
    "the latter expression can then be used to replace the nonlinear convective term @xmath9 in the momentum equation , which leads to the following linearized flow model    @xmath25    apart from the special form of the convective term this amounts to an oseen problem with convective velocity @xmath1 that will neither be smooth nor divergence free in general . to complete the description of the model , we impose the following boundary conditions @xmath26    we thus prescribe the full velocity field at the inflow boundary and use a neumann - type boundary condition at the outflow .",
    "a no - slip condition is used at the walls of the channel .",
    "also other types of the boundary conditions could be incorporated with minor changes .",
    "the functions @xmath7 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 arising as data in the flow model will later enter the reconstruction process as additional parameters which are to be determined .      since the data @xmath1 stem from measurements",
    ", one can in general not require their spatial smoothness .",
    "it is therefore not clear a - priori , if the model  is meaningful from a mathematical point of view . as a first step , we thus want to clarify the well - posedness of the linearized flow model .",
    "[ thm:1 ] let @xmath29 .",

    ".    the result follows with standard arguments for the analysis of the stationary flow equations .",
    "since the momentum equation is a bit non - standard , we sketch the main steps of the proof .",
    "the weak solution of problem  is characterized by the following mixed variational problem : find @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath39 on @xmath14 and @xmath40 on @xmath13 such that @xmath41 for all @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is the bilinear form for the viscous term , @xmath46 represents the convective term , and @xmath47 the weak form for the divergence operator . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that @xmath48 in the sequel .",
    "due to the special form of the convective terms , the form @xmath49 is anti - symmetric , which implies @xmath50 .",
    "the assumption @xmath29 further implies that @xmath51 is bounded for @xmath52 .",
    "standard arguments used for the analysis of the oseen problem then yield the assertions ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii ) for details .",
    "as can be seen from the proof , the special form of the convective term and of the outflow boundary condition were essential here to obtain the well - posedness and the energy estimate under minimal regularity assumptions on the measured flow field .",
    "the linearization procedure introduces some perturbations which we would like to quantify next . to be able to do so",
    ", we set up a flow model of similar structure which describes the true flow .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the true velocity and pressure fields which are assumed to be sufficiently smooth .",

    "let @xmath63 denote the solution of problem  with @xmath1 replaced by @xmath53 .",
    "the error can then be decomposed into @xmath64 with functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 that can be estimated separately . from the definition of @xmath18 and @xmath69 , we observe that @xmath70 on @xmath71 and @xmath72 for all @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath73 . choosing @xmath74 and @xmath75 as test functions and applying the poincar - friedrichs inequality yields @xmath76 since the term @xmath77 can be bounded uniformly by theorem  [ thm:1 ] , we further obtain @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be bounded by @xmath80 with the usual arguments .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath84 .",
    "the assertion of theorem  [ thm:2 ] then follows by a combination of these estimates .",

    "for illustration , let us discuss a particular example which will also serve as our test problem later on .      in simple geometries",

    "this observation will be the guideline for the formulation of our reconstruction method in the next section .",
    "for the enhancement of the velocity measurements @xmath1 , we now consider the following linearization of the optimal control approach  outlined in the introduction .    @xmath101    the choice of function spaces over which is minimized is clear from the theorems of the previous section and the norms in the regularization terms .",
