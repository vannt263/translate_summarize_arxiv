    "reflections and resonances can lead to a loss of the actual transmission phase of the interference paths @xcite and yield abrupt @xmath0 phase jumps @xcite .",

    "a simple series and parallel connection of resistors does not fully apply to our 1d waveguide network in which the orthogonal cross - junctions partially maintain the 1d transport character . as expected , the conductance characteristic of device a has a higher threshold voltage and more significant plateaux than that of device b because it exhibits a stronger 1d confinement . from the conductance measurements at 4.2  k we can estimate the number of populated subbands in the waveguides at lower temperatures . in the gate voltage range of 0.6 to 0.73",
    "v about 3 to 6 and 8 to 12 subbands were populated in the case of device a and b , respectively .    at temperatures below 1  k conductance fluctuations are superimposed on the characteristic measurements and finally wash out the conductance steps at the base temperature .",

    "the ab oscillations are significantly smaller than irregular @xmath20-dependent resistance fluctuations .",

    "these irregular features are superimposed on the electrostatic ab oscillation phase shift , and we suggest electron wave scattering and reflections in the waveguide cross - junctions as possible causes .    a theoretical approach of kreisbeck and kramer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite includes scattering and reflections at realistically designed waveguide cross - junctions in a corresponding waveguide quantum ring .",
    "the calculation results qualitatively reproduce our experimental findings : in the non - local four - terminal setup the ab oscillation phase shifts continuously in certain energy ranges which are interrupted by irregular abrupt @xmath0 phase jumps , regions of reduced visibility and higher harmonic oscillations .",
    "these irregular features are mainly attributed to fermi - energy - dependent scattering , reflections and resonances at the waveguide cross - junctions @xcite .    in recent",
    "four - terminal ballistic quasi-1d rings @xcite a continuous ab oscillation phase shift was not observed for three reasons : firstly , geometrical symmetries impose symmetries on the transmission coefficients which force the four - terminal resistance to be an even function in the magnetic field @xcite , secondly , the electron phase - coherence length may be too small the ring extensions @xcite , and thirdly , reflections at the leads and resonances between the leads impose symmetry under magnetic field reversal because the transmission phases picked up along the waveguides cancel out over the reflections @xcite .",
    "we conclude , that in our devices , the ring dimensions and the qwr leads which connect the 2d reservoirs with the waveguide ring play a decisive role to break phase rigidity : the current and voltage probes are in closest vicinity to the ring , and each lead connects the ring separately .",
    "in addition the 2d-1d mode - matching resistances between the 2d reservoirs and the qwr leads occur outside of the ab ring and the voltage / current leads .",
    "orthogonal crossings of the waveguides at the leads minimize scattering and reflections .      in this section , we investigate electron dephasing with temperature .",
    "multi - mode transport and a maximum in ab resistance oscillation amplitude were ensured by a proper choice of the applied gate voltages of @xmath52  v and 0.73  v in the local and the non - local configuration of device b , respectively . in order to minimize external effects we chose identical instrumental setups with the same currents in both measurement configurations .",

    "the attenuation of the ab oscillation visibility can be approximated @xcite as @xmath72 , where in our device @xmath73 is the propagation time along the mean path of the ring @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the total dephasing rate accounting for all dephasing mechanisms . in general , electron dephasing results from electron - phonon , electron - electron and magnetic impurity interactions as well as thermal averaging . in ballistic conductors , especially 1d structures ,",
    "inter - subband and boundary scattering may come into play as well , and in ab rings elastic scattering randomizes the phase due to a random modification of the electrons path lengths @xcite",
    ".    however , at low temperatures the dominating dephasing mechanisms in ballistic conductors are electron - electron scattering @xcite and thermal averaging @xcite .",
    "electron - electron scattering leads to phase breaking of the involved electron waves with a rate @xmath76 whereas thermal averaging gives rise to phase averaging due to the thermal broadening of roughly @xmath77 around the fermi energy @xmath78 and can be associated with a rate @xmath79 .",

    "@xmath83 was determined by a first - order approximation of @xmath42 around @xmath78 .",
    "phase averaging becomes relevant when the propagation time is in the order of the dephasing time @xmath84 and the phase difference is @xmath85 .",

    "compared with the experimental values ( @xmath69  k@xmath70 and @xmath71  k@xmath70 ) , the rough estimate @xmath90  k@xmath70 indicates that thermal averaging is the predominant cause of dephasing in the non - local measurement configuration .",
    "recently , seelig and bttiker proposed a phase - breaking mechanism related to potential fluctuations in the waveguides of the ring being induced by fluctuating voltages at the voltage sensing leads @xcite",
    ". the measurement circuitry can contribute to dephasing with a dephasing rate linear in temperature and depending on the measurement configuration @xcite as well as gates @xcite .",
    "significantely different dephasing rates in the local and the non - local measurement configurations are expected if the transmission of electrons from a lead into the two ring arms is asymmetric @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the discussed probe - configuration - dependence of the dephasing has been observed in a symmetric ab ring covered by local finger top - gates of 100  nm width @xcite .",
    "the determined total dephasing rates are around 2.5  k@xmath70 and 1  k@xmath70 in the local and the non - local probe configurations , respectively , illustrating the drastic influence of the measurement circuitry on decoherence . for our geometrically asymmetric ring with a global top - gate",
    "the tendency is the same .",
    "[ tempdec ]  ( b ) shows that dephasing in the local configuration is stronger than in the non - local configuration ( @xmath69  k@xmath70 and @xmath71  k@xmath70 ) .",
    "our findings complement the results on dephasing mechanisms in multi - terminal ballistic 1d ab rings by a globally top - gated interferometer both asymmetric in geometry and electron transmission .",
    "the transmission asymmetry , here realized by orthogonal cross - junctions , is expected to increase the measurement - configuration - dependence of dephasing @xcite . a full clarification of the observed dephasing will require a theoretical approach which takes into account the specific geometry , the asymmetric transmission at the orthogonal waveguide cross - junctions and the global top - gate .",
    "in summary , we have investigated asymmetric four - terminal waveguide quantum rings with respect to electron phase sensitivity and thermal dephasing . a global top - gate enables the electrostatic control of the transmission phase determined from ab resistance oscillations . in the non - local four - probe measurement configuration",
    "a continuous transmission phase shift was observed .",
    "the magnitude of this shift was roughly approximated with a single - electron model and is in good agreement with the experimental observation .",
    "we attribute the general observation of a phase shift to ( a ) the strongly asymmetric quantum ring geometry breaking transmission symmetries , ( b ) the realization of individual 1d qwr voltage and current leads , ( c ) the distance between the 1d leads which is smaller than the phase coherence length and to ( d ) minimized reflections between current and voltage leads due to orthogonal waveguide cross - junctions .",
    "the temperature dependence of ab oscillations yields different dephasing rates in the local and the non - local measurement configurations .",
    "this demonstrate the influence of the measurement circuitry on dephasing .",
    "the ab oscillation amplitude decreases exponentially with temperature . while the non - local measurement is dominated by thermal averaging alone , potential fluctuations are an additional source of decoherence in the local measurement .",
    "our results demonstrate the control of the transmission phase and the accurate determination of its shift in an electron waveguide ab interferometer .",
    "the investigated 1d - geometry appears promising for future studies of the coherence and transmission phase in single - mode transport with respect to correlation and spin effects of embedded or attached quantum devices and circuits .",

    "<S> phase sensitivity and thermal dephasing in coherent electron transport in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide rings of an asymmetric four - terminal geometry are studied by magnetotransport measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the electrostatic control of the phase in aharonov - bohm ( ab ) resistance oscillations and investigate the impact of the measurement circuitry on decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> phase rigidity is broken due to the ring geometry : orthogonal waveguide cross - junctions and 1d leads minimize reflections and resonances between leads allowing for a continuous electron transmission phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement circuitry influences dephasing : thermal averaging dominates in the non - local measurement configuration while additional influence of potential fluctuations becomes relevant in the local configuration . </S>"
