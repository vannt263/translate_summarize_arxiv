    "thinking about classical nonlinear physics , solitons are peculiar solutions which can be characterized by constant velocity and shape . recently ,",
    "wllert and honecker @xcite pursuing the understanding of the extension of the soliton concept to the quantum regime , chose the easy - axis ferromagnetic @xmath3 model as the scenario in which to analyze how a localized quantum wave packet evolves in time .",
    "they have shown that besides the quantum mechanical delocalization due to the uncertainty principle , they are in qualitative agreement with its classical counterpart . following this objective of deciphering the quantum soliton term , we tackle an alternative problem in which we study the time evolution of a one - dimensional topological quantum soliton after a quench .    the study of nonequilibrium phenomena in one - dimensional systems has become a very active area of research in recent years due to new advances in the experiments wih ultracold atoms in optical lattices , @xcite and the latest studies on thermalization after quantum quenches @xcite . with these ideas in mind ,",
    "we propose a frustrated @xmath4-@xmath5 spin-@xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain as a suitable framework in which to conduct the analysis .",
    "it is know that this model undergoes a phase transition from a quasi - long - range ordered ground state to a product of localized singlets clusters as a function of the next - nearest neighbor parameter .",
    "moreover , this hamiltonian has an exact ground state at the majumdar - ghosh ( mg ) point @xmath6 @xcite , and a variational approach describes the elementary excitations adequately @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in this work we propose a fine - tuned magnetic soliton as the initial pattern which will be evolved in time after a quantum quench of the model parameters . in order to create this initial spin-@xmath0 excitation",
    ", we choose a one - dimensional chain with spin - phonon coupling as a witness case , which is realized in quasi - one dimensional spin - peierls systems such as cugeo@xmath7 ( ref .  ) and tio@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach would be to prepare the initial excitation and conduct the time evolution in a setup of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "once the initial soliton is prepared , we follow the dynamics of this excitation on the uniform zig - zag heisenberg chain , driven by a quench of the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "we observe that , in the gapless phase of the model , the initial soliton evolves into two counterpropagating modes , indicating a quantum superposition of left- and right- moving components of the original soliton . as time evolves , the excitation remains quite stable despite the quantum - mechanical spreading . on the other hand , for a highly localized soliton generated in the mg point , the excitation shows quick spreading with time evolution .",
    "we select the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and bosonization @xcite as the numerical and analytical techniques to conduct our study .",
    "there are plenty of examples in the literature showing that both methods are convenient for giving a reliable description of spin chain systems , particularly , when the coupling to the lattice is also considered @xcite . among different dmrg options @xcite , we use the algorithm introduced by manmana _",
    "et al _ , @xcite that allows us to perform non equilibrium simulations for systems with interactions beyond the nearest neighbors .",
    "it is worth mentioning that related studies were done on spin transport , even at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "in order to generate a soliton - like topological excitation , we introduce a one dimensional antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian with first and second neighbor interactions and spin - lattice coupling , which reads @xmath10 \\mathbf{s}_{i } \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{i+1 } + \\beta \\mathbf{s}_{i-1 } \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{i+1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath11 is a spin-1/2 operator for the @xmath12th lattice site , and we have set @xmath13 as the energy scale , such that @xmath14 is the second neighbor exchange coupling ; @xmath15 is the dimensionless bond length variation , where @xmath16 are the displacements of the magnetic ions from their equilibrium positions , and @xmath17 is the spin - lattice coupling parameter .",
    "although frustration is not necessary to present our ideas , we introduce it in order to compare it with the well - known mg limit @xcite to achieve a better understanding of the process .",
    "so , with the intention of promoting a sort of quantum topological soliton , we break the lattice symmetry to manipulate the nearest neighbor magnetic interaction . from the studies of models with spin - phonon coupling",
    "it is known that , when phonons are treated adiabatically , the stable pattern for @xmath18 in the @xmath19 sector is the one called the static lattice soliton , given by @xmath20 .",
    "the domain wall is centered at site @xmath21 and its width is given by @xmath22 , which produces an interpolation between two dimerized patterns .",
    "the @xmath23 magnetic soliton generated by this lattice arrangement is also centered at site @xmath21 , and the number of sites involved within the wall is controlled by the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the lattice configuration generated with the set of parameters @xmath25 , together with the associated spin pattern given by @xmath26 , which was obtained from eq .",
    "( [ hspindelta ] ) using dmrg in a lattice of size @xmath27 , where the odd number of sites is to set the total magnetization to @xmath1 .",
    "we use open boundary conditions keeping @xmath28 states , enough to assure the accuracy , with a truncation error of order @xmath29 in the worst case .",
    "we see that most of the spins arrange in localized singlet clusters , producing zero local magnetization . however , in the center of the chain where the bonds interpolate between the two possible dimerized states , @xmath30 .",

    "being oscillatory at the lattice level , the last term vanishes . in the @xmath23 subspace the field goes from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the expression for @xmath36 is @xmath45 as the bosonized version of the hamiltonian ( [ hspindelta ] ) is not exactly solvable for general displacements @xmath18 , we resort to a semiclassical solution in order to calculate the mean value of the field in the corresponding subspace and compare with the dmrg results . this solution can be obtained by adding an elastic energy term @xmath46 to the hamiltonian and treating @xmath18 in the adiabatic approximation @xcite .",
    "the classical solutions for the continuous fields are @xmath47 and @xmath48 $ ] . with the inclusion of an elastic energy term ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath22 depend on the values of the microscopic parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the previous dmrg calculation we chose @xmath18 with arbitrary @xmath24 and @xmath22 , i.e. not subject to fulfilling an adiabatic equation . in the spirit of a semi - classical quantization @xcite we assume the following ansatz for the mean value of the bosonic field : @xmath51 $ ] , where the subindex @xmath52 refers to a solitonic pattern . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a fitting to the numerical results using the analytical expression , for which we obtain a good agreement with @xmath53 .",
    "we now turn off the spin - lattice coupling and study the dynamics of this magnetic excitation , which will be conducted by a homogeneous heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "once the quantum soliton is constructed , the time - dependent dmrg ( t - dmrg ) algorithm enables us to evolve in time under this new homogeneous hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "as a gapless phase is stable for @xmath55 , we analyze different tuned solitons in this zone where the bosonization analysis is valid . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the dynamics of two witness cases which are defined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 . one can observe that the excitations behave in a subtle way . in both cases ,",
    "the time evolution shows how the original soliton evolves in such a way that , at a given time , two spin clouds are observed , each of them carrying @xmath58 . remarkably , these right and left modes are quite stable : as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , these modes barely disperse as time evolves",
    ". we will return to this interpretation later .",
    "these left and right excitations travel at a velocity which agrees very well with the spin wave velocity of the low energy excitations of the homogeneous chain .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by comparing the evolution of the maximum of @xmath59 with the spin wave velocity @xmath60 predicted by the bethe ansatz for the one dimensional homogeneous heisenberg chain @xcite , and the renormalized @xmath61 calculated in ref .   using exact diagonalization in small chains .",
    "let us analyze the origin of this behavior by studying the time evolution in the bosonization language .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath62 in the bosonic representation corresponds to a ( 1 + 1 ) free bosonic field theory , up to marginally irrelevant operators @xcite .",
    "these marginal operators vanish at @xmath63 .",
    "the time evolution of the mean value of @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 $ ] . to obtain the previous expression , we have taken into account that , in the initial state , the field @xmath64 is split into its left and right parts @xmath66 originating from the left and right fermions in the bosonization procedure .",
    "for a time - independent state , @xmath67 as in the initial situation discussed above . on the other hand ,",
    "the time evolution of @xmath68 is independent of that of @xmath69 , and it is given by a simple shift in @xmath70 to the left and to the right , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the cumulative magnetization for different times copared to the dmrg results .",
    "we used the fitted value to the static solution for @xmath71 in @xmath72 , as shown for the @xmath33 case in fig .",
    "a similar procedure gives @xmath73 for the @xmath74 case .",
    "we also fix @xmath75 to the spin - wave velocity of the homogeneous chains as previously discussed .    )",
    "the observed jump to @xmath76 as time evolves , signals the quantum interference of left and right soliton states.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we observe a fairly good comparison between the dmrg and bosonization results , especially when @xmath77 is near the critical value @xmath78 .",
    "this is due to the reduction of the finite - size effect in the latter case : as the evolution of the resulting excitations is slower as @xmath77 increases , they do not reach the edge of the chain for the last time , @xmath79 , obtained in our calculation . the improved fitting between both results",
    "could also be due to the fact that the marginal irrelevant term neglected in the bosonized hamiltonian could play some role in the short - distance correlations which , nonetheless , vanishes at @xmath78 . as in the numerical results , we see that the original soliton does not propagate in a particular direction but the state splits into two counterpropagating modes as a consequence of the chiral symmetry of the hamiltonian . as this pattern arises as a sum of two topological protected excitations , one on the right sector and one on the left sector of the theory , we can assume that the global excitation is also protected and remains stable with the time evolution .",
    "the jump in @xmath36 indicates that each chiral mode carries @xmath58 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a superposition @xmath80 of two @xmath19 quantum soliton states , such that @xmath81 @xmath82 is a state propagating to the left ( right ) .",
    "the system retains the memory of the initial state , but the original soliton state evolves into two chiral states as the time evolution is carried out with a hamiltonian whose left and right modes are independent .",
    "however , the elementary excitations of the uniform heisenberg model are not these type of solitons , notably the dynamical states preserve coherence and disperse quite slowly .",
    "it is worth remarking that working with an odd number of sites is not a necessary condition for these results .",
    "an even number of sites will sustain a pair of soliton and antisoliton excitations . for long enough separation between them in order to prevent interaction effects , the conclusion remains the same , so that each soliton will split into two left and right modes as time evolves .",
    "one wonders if in the limiting case of a soliton of zero width , i.e. , at the mg point ( @xmath83 ) , such mechanism could come into effect .",
    "the mg point is a good scenario to create such localized excitation , and as it has an exact eigensolution built of singlets , we analyze the case in order to compare our numerical calculations with the variational approach of ref .  .",
    "to recreate this situation we use @xmath84 and @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ hspindelta ] ) , and set to zero the exchange parameters connecting to site @xmath85 as well .",
    "thereby , we establish a free spin at the center of the lattice , separating two mg domains @xmath86{spinon}}}\\rangle}$ ] with singlets @xmath87{dimer}}}\\rangle}\\!=\\!\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[{\\vert{{\\uparrow}{\\downarrow}}\\rangle}-{\\vert{{\\downarrow}{\\uparrow}}\\rangle}]$ ] .",
    "since the physics we want to describe is localized , we choose a lattice of @xmath88 in the @xmath89 subspace without worrying about the edge effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the time evolution of @xmath34 once the uniform zigzag heisenberg model is restored , from which we can appreciate two things .",
    "first , we have appropriate agreement with the variational approach @xcite , where elementary excitations are described by @xmath90 $ ] . the slope of the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] agrees with the maximum group velocity that results from the variational dispersion relation .",
    "we are not aware of other numerical calculations showing this in the literature .",
    "secondly , we have qualitative agreement with the effective hamiltonian description proposed in ref .   for the dynamics of a free spin hopping between next nearest neighbors .",
    "it is easy to appreciate that the initial free spin reduces its module at the center site with the time evolution , transferring its spin component to the next nearest neighbor .",
    "the spin uses the mechanism of exchange mediated by @xmath5 to avoid breaking the dimers , which would result in a loss of magnetic energy .",
    "different from the mechanism previously described in which we found a separation into chiral modes , here the time evolution of @xmath34 shows the expected dispersion of the original individual excitation moving in a singlet sea .",
    "the initial excitation can not remain highly localized because of the uncertainty principle . as the quasiparticle is localized in real space",
    ", it involves a broad range of momenta in the reciprocal space , in which case the excitation spreads very quickly .",
    "two experimental realizations of the previous mechanism are envisaged .",
    "one is on spin - peierls materials such as cugeo@xmath7 ( ref .  ) or tio@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite . at low temperatures , below a critical value @xmath91",
    ", these materials undergo a magneto structural transition in which the lattice dimerizes and a spin gap opens in the magnetic spectrum . applying a magnetic field larger than the critical one @xmath92 , a soliton lattice is generated which has been characterized by x - ray scattering measurements @xcite . for not too strong a magnetic field above @xmath92 , the magnetic chains realize our initial state because the solitons are far apart .",
    "then , the field should be turned off and the temperature raised above @xmath91 .",
    "the system should now be in the uniform phase and the magnetism should be described by a homogeneous heisenberg hamiltonian , which will conduct the time evolution as well .",
    "another possible realization is in recent experiments of ultracold atoms trapped in a one - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "recently , the bosonic repulsive hubbard model has been successfully accomplished @xcite to study the dynamics of spin excitations on a ferromagnetic background . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermionic version has been realized @xcite , and once the limitations related to the temperature are overcome , it is expected that the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model can be simulated by tuning the feshbach resonances for large on - site repulsion .     for the free spin on a lattice of 41 sites at the mg point @xmath83 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the maximum group velocity according to the variational dispersion relation obtained from ref .  .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "we described a mechanism based on the preparation of a soliton , which after a quench of the interaction drives the system to the formation of a state composed of two counterpropagating components as times evolves , producing two - well defined spin clouds in the chain , each of them with total magnetization @xmath93 .",
    "this state can be interpreted as a quantum superposition of left and right moving @xmath19 quantum soliton states that are protected by the chiral separation of the hamiltonian .",
    "remarkably , they remain stable as time evolves , showing a very slow dispersion .",
    "we propose a recipe to obtain these states , consisting of an initial preparation of a topological protected excitation by a modulation of the exchange couplings , followed by a quench of the interactions , generating new left and right solitonic states that will evolve in time through a hamiltonian whose left and right modes are independent . on the other hand",
    ", the situation for the mg point is different .",
    "as the initial excitation is local in real space , its distribution in momentum space is very broad , leading to a rapid dispersion of the excitation as time evolves .",
    "the most natural candidates to observe those phenomena would be spin - peierls materials and ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
