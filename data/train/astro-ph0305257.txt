    "one of the main tools used in the study of dust grain properties is extinction curves , particularly ultraviolet ( uv ) extinction curves .",
    "the uv is where dust extinction is strongest and shows the large variations from region to region in the milky way @xcite , large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite , and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite found that most of the variation in milky way extinction curves could be described by an empirically relationship based on the single parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this was a major step forward in our understanding of dust properties and was possible only due to the existence in the literature of near - infrared photometry for a subset of stars in the @xcite sample .",
    "this allowed @xcite to determine @xmath0 values and transform the @xcite extinction curves to an absolute scale ( i.e. , normalized to @xmath4 instead of @xmath5 ) .",
    "these @xmath4 normalized curves had variations which were correlated with @xmath0 allowing @xcite to empirically derive the @xmath0 dependent ccm relationship .",
    "since the @xmath0 value is a rough measure of average dust grain size , this gave a physical basis for the variations in extinction curves .",
    "it is worth noting that significant , small deviations from the ccm relationship are seen for individual sightlines @xcite .",
    "the one caveat on the result of @xcite is that the strength of uv dust extinction limits the measurement of uv dust extinction curves to low to moderate reddening sightlines .",
    "this results in a significant bias in measured uv extinction curves in the milky way to regions surrounding the sun . in the one of the largest , detailed study of uv dust extinction curves in the milky way to date , @xcite presented curves for 78 sightlines and the average distance probed was 1.3 kpc .",
    "the ccm relationship was derived from a subset of the @xcite sample and , as such , this relationship might only be valid for dust in our region of the milky way .",
    "@xcite tested the validity of the ccm relationship for a larger region of the milky way by measuring uv extinction curves along very low - density sightlines .",
    "the 26 extinction curves in their sample had an average distance of 5.2 kpc .",
    "they found that 19 of the 26 extinction curves in their sample were qualitatively consistent with the ccm relationship .",
    "the remaining 7 curves had shapes which are not described by the ccm relationship and were qualitatively similar to those seen in the part of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite associated with the lmc2 supershell ( near the 30 dor star formation region ) .",
    "these 7 curves were all clustered in the same region in the sky and this sightline through the galaxy displays evidence for shocked dust @xcite .",
    "the ccm relationship seems to be a good description of milky way extinction curves with a few exceptions .",
    "this raises the question : does the ccm relationship describe the dust outside of the milky way ?",
    "in other words , are the extinction curves in other galaxies quantitatively similar to those in the milky way ? only in the magellanic clouds can this question be answered as these are the only two galaxies with reliably measured uv extinction curves . a full answer this question requires @xmath0 values for all the magellanic cloud extinction curves and this has only been possible with the recent release of the 2mass observations of the magellanic clouds .",
    "this is the motivation for this paper .",
    "even without all the needed @xmath0 measurements , previous work has gone a long way in answering the above question .",
    "it was quickly realized with the first few measured extinction curves in the lmc and smc the that clouds had curves which were similar to milky way curves as well as curves which were quite different .",
    "for example , the sightlines towards the lmc star sk  -69  108 @xcite and the smc star azv  456 @xcite display milky way - like extinction curves . on the other hand , sightlines near 30-dor in the lmc @xcite and in the star forming bar of the smc @xcite show definite non - milky way - like extinction curves especially in their 2175    bump and far - uv rise strengths .    in order to move from a qualitative to a quantitative comparison of magellanic cloud and milky way extinction curves , @xmath0 values are needed for each extinction curve .",
    "this allows for the normalization of the extinction curves by @xmath4 instead of the usual @xmath5 which the @xcite work proved was vitally important in understanding the true differences between extinction curves . while , the studies of @xcite and @xcite concentrated on deriving all the uv extinction curves possible with _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) archival data in the smc and lmc , respectively , they also presented @xmath0 values for a subset of the smc and lmc curves . ideally , the @xmath0 values for each extinction curve should be derived from near - infrared photometry of both the reddened and comparison stars which make up each curve .",
    "this ensures that the measured extinction curve and @xmath0 value correspond to the same dust column and both are similarly corrected for foreground milky way dust .",
    "due to the paucity of near - infrared photometry for their reddened and ( especially ) comparison stars , a majority of the @xmath0 values presented in @xcite and @xcite were based on assumed near - infrared intrinsic colors .",
    "in addition , the reddened stars colors were not corrected for milky way foreground dust .",
    "this interjected a significant error in the @xmath0 values .",
    "for example , the foreground extinction can be up to 25% of the total extinction for the lmc extinction curves @xcite .",
    "this results in significant differences between @xmath0 values reported in these two studies and previous work @xcite .",
    "the release of the 2mass data for the magellanic clouds makes it possible to correctly and accurately compute @xmath0 values for all the known extinction curves in the magellanic clouds @xcite using the 2mass near - infrared photometry of the reddened and comparison stars .",
    "we combine archival international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) ultraviolet spectra , optical photometry , and the 2mass @xcite and denis @xcite near - infrared photometry with new hubble space telescope ( hst ) space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ultraviolet spectroscopy and optical photometry to derive ultraviolet through near - infrared extinction curves for 24 sightlines in the magellanic clouds in  [ sec_data ] . in the same section",
    ", we also measure the @xmath0 and column for all 24 extinction curves . in ",
    "[ sec_discuss ] , we quantitatively compare milky way and magellanic cloud extinction curves as well as discuss various average magellanic cloud extinction curves and the existence or lack thereof of the 2175    bump in the smc bar .",
    "we present data on all the sightlines in the magellanic clouds which have uv extinction curves .",
    "the sightlines include 23 based on iue data which have been published previously @xcite and one based on stis data which are published for the first time in this paper . for each sightline",
    ", we have gathered uv spectra and optical and near - infrared photometry for both the reddened and comparison stars . from these data ,",

    "ubvri photometric data for all of the smc stars as well as two of the lmc stars ( sk -67 36 and sk -68 26 ) , were obtained on observing runs during 1998 august and september , 1999 january , and 2001 august .",
    "the data were acquired at the 1.5-m telescope of the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "a c31034a gaas photomultiplier , ubvri filter set # 3 , and the standard photoelectric data acquisition system were used .",
    "extinction and transformation relations , including non - linear transformation relations were applied to the instrumental data .",
    "the final magnitudes and color indices are on the photometric system defined by @xcite .",
    "the ubv optical photometry for the remainder of the lmc stars was taken from @xcite .",
    "the jhk near - infrared photometry for most of the smc and lmc stars was taken from the results of the 2mass project @xcite .",
    "the jhk photometry for the smc stars azv  456 and azv  462 was taken from @xcite . for two of the three lmc stars without 2mass photometry , we used the denis @xcite jk photometry converted to the 2mass system @xcite .",
    "for the one lmc star without 2mass or denis photometry due to a nearby saturating star , we used jhk images of sk  -68  26 and its surrounding region which were taken using the cerro tololo infrared imager ( cirim ) at the ctio 1.5 m .",
    "these images were taken on 15 dec 1999 in non - photometric weather and each band was observed 4 times offsetting between positions for a total exposure time of 4 seconds .",
    "the field - of - view of the coadded images was approximately @xmath6 . in this region , 5 of the bright stars",
    "have 2mass observations and we used these stars to calibrate the jhk fluxes for sk  -68  26 using differential photometry .",
    "the uncertainty in these measurements was calculated as the standard deviation of the mean of the the 5 measurements of the jhk magnitudes of sk  -68  26 , one measurement per 2mass star .",
    "the uv spectra for all but two of the stars in this paper were taken from archival iue observations .",
    "the specific iue observations we used are given by @xcite for the smc stars and @xcite for the lmc stars .",
    "the individual iue observations were downloaded from the mast archive at space telescope science institute ( stsci ) and were coadded to produce a single spectrum from 1150 to 3225    with a resolution of approximately 400 .",
    "the calibration of these spectra was improved using the results of @xcite who found that the signal - to - noise of iue low - dispersion data could be significantly improved over that provided in the iue archive .",
    "the uv spectra for the final two stars ( azv  23 and 404 ) were taken with the stis instrument on hst as part of our go program # 8198 .",
    "the spectra were taken using the 52x0.5@xmath7 slit with the g140l and g230l gratings .",

    "in addition , the superior nature of stis ultraviolet spectra as compared to iue spectra can be seen by comparing this figure with fig .  1 of @xcite which displays iue spectra for similar spectral type stars .",
    "the extinction curves for sightlines in the magellanic clouds were derived using the standard pair method .",
    "the reddened / comparison star pairs used are listed in table  [ tab_ext_data ] .",
    "we rederived the 23 extinction curves presented in @xcite and @xcite to take into account the new calibration of iue low - dispersion data @xcite and the new optical and near - infrared photometry .",
    "the effects of the new calibration of the iue spectra on the uv extinction curves was small , mainly reducing the noise in the curves .",
    "the one new extinction curve in the smc for the azv  23 sightline is presented in fig .  [ fig_stis ] at it s full spectral resolution .",
    "we calculated all 24 extinction curves and their associated uncertainties as outlined in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we removed the effects of the ly@xmath8 absorption using our measurements of the column ( see  [ sec_hi ] ) .",
    "these extinction curves give the difference in extinction between the two sightlines to the reddened and comparison stars .",
    "the milky way foreground component is effectively removed as long as the reddening due to this component towards the reddened and comparison star pairs are similar @xcite .",
    "this results in an extinction curve that only measures dust in the magellanic clouds .",
    "all 24 extinction curves are plotted in figs .  [ fig_smc_curves]-[fig_lmc_gen_curves ] .",
    "we fit each curve with the fm parameterization of the shape of the uv extinction curve @xcite .",
    "the fm parameterization is @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "we determined the fm parameters for the extinction curves by numerically minimizing the @xmath16 in a manner similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "first , @xmath17 and @xmath18 were fixed and the values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 were determined by minimizing the @xmath16 .",
    "next , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath18 were fixed and the value of @xmath17 was determined by minimizing the @xmath16 . finally , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath17 were fixed and the value of @xmath18 was determined by minimizing the @xmath16 .",
    "these two steps were repeated until the @xmath16 no longer changed by a significant amount .",
    "this three step method gives a smaller @xmath16 than doing a single @xmath16 minimization while simultaneously fitting all 6 parameters .",
    "it is worth noting that there are probably only 5 independent parameters in the fm equation . while all evidence points to @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 being correlated in the milky way and the magellanic clouds @xcite , we have not assumed this correlation .",
    "for the 4 smc bar extinction curves , we set @xmath23 and @xmath24 as the weak to nonexistent 2175    bumps in these curves precludes fitting all three bump parameters .",
    "this allows for a more realistic measurement of the bump strength or an upper limit for these weak bump sightlines .",
    "the uncertainties in the fm parameters for low @xmath5 sightlines are dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath5 and the random uncertainties of each wavelength point .",
    "the uncertainties in the extinction curves were calculated using eq .  2 of @xcite .",
    "from this equation , it can be seen that an uncertainty in @xmath5 affects the extinction curve in a correlated way .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath5 do not add random noise to each wavelength point , but shift the entire extinction curve up and down .",
    "the random uncertainties at each wavelength point contribute a smaller uncertainty , except in the case of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the contribution of uncertainties in @xmath5 ( @xmath25 $ ] ) to the fm parameter uncertainties were calculated by fitting the two additional curves for each measured extinction curve which describe the effects of the @xmath5 uncertainty .",
    "these curves are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath5 uncertainties in each fm parameter were then one half the difference between the parameters for these two curves .",
    "the fm parameter uncertainties due to the random uncertainties ( @xmath28 ) were calculated using a monte carlo approach .",
    "determining the random component of the fm parameter uncertainties is not usually done , but we found that the random component dominates the @xmath17 and @xmath18 uncertainties .",
    "this method consisted of generating 100,000 possible fm fits similar to the best fm fit and determining which ones fit equally well within @xmath29 using the f - test where the @xmath30 is only that due to random flux uncertainties .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 uncertainties were determined by dividing by three .",
    "the reported fm uncertainties ( see table  [ tab_fm_param ] ) were determined by summing in quadrature the @xmath5 associated ( @xmath25 $ ] ) and random ( @xmath28 ) uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath5 uncertainties dominate the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 uncertainties , while the random uncertainties dominate the @xmath17 and @xmath18 uncertainties .",
    "the value of @xmath3 for each sightline was determined using a @xmath16 minimization method .",
    "this method relies on the invariance of the rijhk portion of the extinction curve @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 value for each extinction curve is the value which minimizes the @xmath16 between the measured rijhk extinction and the @xcite curve .",
    "the equation giving @xmath32 was solved and the analytic solution for @xmath0 was found . from this equation , the uncertainty for @xmath0 was derived .",
    "see the appendix for details of this derivation .",
    "the @xmath0 values and uncertainties are tabulated in table  [ tab_ext_data ] .",
    "our method of using the rijhk extinction curve itself to determine @xmath0 values is different from what is usually done .",
    "usually the observed vrijhk or just vk photometry of the reddened star is compared to assumed intrinsic colors @xcite . in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "the reddened stars are usually first corrected for the average milky way foreground reddening @xcite .",
    "instead , we have used the measured vrijkh photometry for the matched comparison star and avoided having to assume intrinsic colors of the reddened star .",
    "this naturally removes the foreground milky way reddening and ensures that the measured @xmath0 value corresponds to the same dust column as the extinction curve . the ccm relationship for these @xmath0 values for each measured extinction curve",
    "is given in figs .",
    "[ fig_smc_curves]-[fig_lmc_gen_curves ] .",
    "the effects of the uncertainty in @xmath0 on the ccm relationship is shown in these plots using dashed curves .",
    "we determined the column for each extinction curve using a variant of the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "this method relies on fitting the wings of the ly@xmath8 absorption profile .",
    "as we are only interested in a measurement of the difference in the column between the reddened and comparison stars , we made this measurement in the ratio spectrum for each reddened and comparison star pair .",
    "the uncertainty in this measurement was estimated by eye , varying the value until it was noticeable incorrect .",
    "two examples of this are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_hi_measure ] .",
    "basically , the strength of a model ly@xmath8 profile is adjusted until the division of the ratio spectrum by the model spectrum yields a straight line .",
    "the central wavelength of the ly@xmath8 line for the lmc and smc is corrected for the heliocentric velocity of the lmc and smc ( 280 and 130 km / s , respectively ) .",
    "the central region of the ly@xmath8 line is ignored as it is contaminated by geocoronal emission .",
    "this measurement is straightforward for the stis data . for iue data ,",
    "this measurement is much more uncertain as the contamination by geocoronal emission is much larger and the spectra blueward of ly@xmath8 are very noisy .",
    "the red wing of ly@xmath8 was mainly used in the measurement of columns for the iue data .",
    "the measured values and uncertainties are tabulated in table  [ tab_ext_data ] .",
    "now that we have produced full ultraviolet to near - infrared extinction curves ( in units of @xmath33 ) for all the known magellanic cloud reddened / comparison star pairs , we can quantitatively compare them to milky way extinction curves .",
    "the @xmath0 dependent ccm relationship and the ccm sample extinction curves provides a nice , compact form for representing the properties of milky way dust found in the local interstellar medium .",
    "thus , we can compare milky way and magellanic clouds dust by seeing if the ccm relationship is applicable to any of the individual extinction curves or describes aspects of the sample behavior of these curves .    to test",
    "if the ccm relationship accurately describes any of the individual extinction curves , we compare the full measured uv to nir extinction curves to the appropriate ccm curve for the measured @xmath0 .",

    "it should be remembered that the ccm relationship gives the average behavior at a particular @xmath0 and that individual curves can have small deviations from this average behavior and still follow the ccm relationship .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig_smc_curves ] that the four curves located in the star - forming bar of the smc ( azv 18 , 23 , 214 , & 398 ) do not follow the ccm relationship . for the one curve located outside of the smc bar ( azv 456 ) ,",
    "the ccm curve does a better job following the measured curve , but there still are significant deviations at the 2175    bump and in the far - uv ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , there are no measured extinction curves in the smc which follow the ccm relationship .    in the lmc ,",
    "there is one curve in the lmc2 sample ( sk  -69  280 ) and three curves in the lmc - average sample ( sk  -66  19 , sk  -68  23 , & sk  -69  108 ) which follow the ccm relationship within their uncertainties ( figs .  [ fig_lmc_lmc2_curves]-[fig_lmc_gen_curves ] ) . thus , there is evidence that the ccm relationship is at work in the lmc , but only in a limited sense as it describes only 4 out of the 19 measured extinction curves .    the most direct way to quantify how applicable the ccm relationship is in the magellanic clouds is to plot @xmath35 versus @xmath36 .",
    "this was how the ccm relationship was originally presented by @xcite .",
    "[ fig_al_rv ] shows such plots for @xmath37 1200 , 1500 , 2200 , & 2800    and u and j bands .",
    "since the ccm relationship represents the average extinction behavior as a function of @xmath0 , saying extinction measurements do not follow ccm is to say that they are beyond the scatter of the extinction curves which were used to derive the ccm relationship . in fig .",
    "[ fig_al_rv ] , the small open circles without error bars give data for the extinction curves used to derive ccm and can be used to determine the scatter which is consistent with the ccm relationship .",
    "these plots show that at far - uv wavelengths ( @xmath37 1200 & 1500   ) the ccm relationship forms a lower bound to the values of @xmath33 at a particular value of @xmath0 . at longer wavelengths ( @xmath38   ) , the magellanic clouds measurements are indistinguishable from the ccm relationship within their uncertainties .    a final way to probe how well the ccm relationship works in the magellanic clouds is to examine behavior of the fm parameters as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the fm parameters describe the uv extinction curve with only 6 parameters allowing for more sensitive tests to be performed .",
    "the fm parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 have a factor of @xmath0 embedded in them , we have plotted the equivalent @xmath0-independent coefficients versus @xmath35 in fig .",

    "for example , all the values of @xmath43 lie on or above the line defining the ccm relationship . in the plots of the other three coefficients ,",
    "the ccm relationship forms an upper bound on their behaviors . in the case of @xmath17 and @xmath18",

    "this scatter is consistent with the uncertainties in @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the scatter is larger than can be accounted for by measurement uncertainties .",
    "thus , it is either real or the result of measurement uncertainties we have not accounted for in our error analysis .    by examining the behavior of the magellanic cloud extinction curves with @xmath0 three different ways and comparing that behavior to that predicted by the @xmath0 dependent ccm relationship",
    ", we find evidence that the general behavior of milky way extinction curves is seen in the magellanic clouds .",
    "not only are 4 lmc extinction curves indistinguishable from milky way extinction curves , but the general behavior of milky way extinction curves forms a bound on the general behavior of magellanic cloud extinction curves .",
    "while a small number of magellanic cloud extinction curves do seem to be well described by the ccm relationship , the majority do not .",
    "yet there is strong evidence that the ccm relationship serves as a bound on the behavior of all the magellanic cloud extinction curves .",
    "this fact raises the question : is there some more general relationship dependent on @xmath0 and at least one other parameter which describes the average behavior of the milky way and magellanic cloud extinction curves ?",
    "an indication that such a relationship might exist was presented by @xcite for low density sightlines in the milky way which display some of the same deviations from ccm seen in the magellanic clouds .",
    "they found that the strength of the 2175    bump ( @xmath46 ) and the steepness of the ultraviolet extinction ( @xmath20 ) were anti - correlated along the low density sightlines as well as for the average curves in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",

    "this plot gives evidence for an anti - correlation between the strength of the 2175    bump and the steepness of the ultraviolet extinction .",
    "one possible second parameter could be the measured gas - to - dust ratio ( @xmath47 ) . to test this",

    "there might be real correlations in both plots , but higher quality data are needed .",
    "there would be reason to expect a correlation between the gas - to - dust ratio and the behavior of extinction curves .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio is known to correlate with metallicity on a galaxy wide basis @xcite . on a local scale",
    ", it could be a measure of the formation and destruction history of dust grains .",
    "for example , the dust self - shielding will decrease with increasing gas - to - dust ratio making it easier for dust grains to be destroyed by the ambient radiation field . if the dust grains responsible for the 2175    bump are easier to destroy than those responsible for the underlying ultraviolet extinction , a behavior like that seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_hiav ] would be expected .",
    "the extremely weak or absent 2175    bump in the four smc bar extinction curves makes these curves unique . in all other measured extinction curves ,",
    "the 2175    bump is quite prominent .",
    "the obvious question is whether the weak 2175    bump in the smc bar is due to milky way contamination or is intrinsic to the smc .",
    "while only one of the four curves has a bump which is detected at greater than @xmath29 , the other three are all @xmath48 detections .",
    "the construction of the curves using smc comparison stars should remove all the milky way foreground , but small differences between the reddened and comparison stars foreground could result in a weak 2175    bump . a foreground contamination like",
    "this would result in a positive bump as often as a negative bump .",
    "interestingly , one out of the four smc bump curves ( azv  214 ) has a @xmath48 detection of a negative bump and a negative far - uv curvature ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the foreground contamination ( in percent of total @xmath5 with @xmath49 uncertainties ) needed to produce spurious bump detections at the observed levels would have to be ( @xmath50)% , ( @xmath51)% , ( @xmath52)% , and ( @xmath53)% for azv  18 , 23 , 214 , and 398 , respectively .",
    "these foreground contaminations are not unlikely given the low @xmath5 values for these sightlines , especially given the large uncertainties .",
    "while it is difficult to definitively decide , the current evidence suggests that the carriers of the 2175    bump could be completely absent from the dust in the smc bar sightlines .      since the magellanic cloud extinction curves display significantly different shapes than that seen in the milky way , average extinction curves of the lmc - average , lmc2-supershell , and smc - bar samples are of interest .",
    "these average curves capture the large scale variations in dust properties at higher signal - to - noise than the individual curves .",
    "while past work has produced such average curves @xcite , we can create more accurate average curves as the result of our determinations of @xmath0 values .",
    "we have averaged the individual curves in each sample in @xmath33 units instead of @xmath54 units as was done in previous work .",
    "@xmath54 units are a relative measure of dust properties whereas @xmath33 units are an absolute measure of the dust properties and , as a result , more accurately represent the effects of dust . for the lmc2 supershell sample",
    ", we have not used the results for sk  -69  256 in producing the lmc2 supershell average .",
    "it s extremely low @xmath0 value of @xmath55 is likely the result of poor jhk photometry , contamination by nearby hot dust , or contamination by a red companion .",

    "the differences between our measurement and @xcite can be traced to our lower @xmath5 and a lower @xmath0 value .",

    "but , examination of their fig .",
    "6 shows that the non-30  dor points fall consistently below 30  dor gas - to - dust ratio implying that we are not in conflict with earlier work .",
    "the lower gas - to - dust ratio is especially interesting as it supports a systematic trend of more extreme extinction curves ( smaller 2175  bump and steeper far - uv rise ) with rising gas - to - dust ratio ( see  [ sec_sccm ] ) .",
    "we have presented a quantitative , exhaustive comparison of all the known magellanic cloud extinction curves with a representative sample of milky way extinction curves . like previous studies @xcite",
    "we find that both the lmc and smc have examples of extinction curves qualitatively similar to those found in the milky way . unlike previous studies , we are able to take this comparison one step further and make quantitative comparisons as we determined @xmath0 values for all magellanic cloud extinction curves .",
    "this allows for the comparison of magellanic cloud and milky way extinction curves to be done using measurements based on absolute dust properties ( @xmath33 ) instead of relative dust properties ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the importance of this difference is well illustrated by the work of @xcite where the comparison of milky way curves in @xmath33 units allowed for the derivation of the @xmath0 dependent ccm relationship .",
    "we conclude that 4 extinction curves in the lmc are _ indistinguishable _ from milky way extinction curves and milky way extinction curves form a bound on the behavior of magellanic cloud extinction curves .",
    "the majority of the magellanic cloud extinction curves are significantly different than milky way extinction curves and this is likely a result of magellanic cloud extinction curves probing quite different environments than the ccm sample of milky way extinction curves .",
    "the ccm sample is based on fairly quiescent sightlines and most of our extinction curve measurements in the magellanic clouds are biased towards quite active regions as they are based on ob supergiants .",
    "the systematic behavior of the curves studied in this paper hint at the existence of a multiparameter relationship ( possibly dependent on @xmath0 and @xmath47 ) describing both quiescent ( ccm - like ) and active extinction curves .",
    "the different biases between the majority of the measured milky way and magellanic cloud extinction curves point to a weakness in our understanding of dust properties .",
    "the magellanic cloud extinction curves are biased towards active star forming regions ( ob supergiant sightlines ) and low dust columns .",
    "the milky way sightlines are less biased towards active star forming regions as they are mainly measured along sightlines towards ob main sequence stars .",
    "they are limited in their variety of dust properties probed as the measurements are generally limited to our local region of the milky way .",
    "evidence that the type of dust seen in the magellanic clouds does exist in the milky way is seen along milky way low density sightlines @xcite .",
    "higher dust column sightlines and sightlines towards main sequence stars need to be measured in the magellanic clouds to allow us to truly explore the possible range of dust properties .",
    "the results of this work and those of @xcite imply that the common usage of discussing milky way , lmc , and smc dust as separate is inaccurate .",

    "<S> we compare the properties of the smc and lmc extinction curves with the ccm relationship three different ways : each curve by itself , the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with @xmath0 , and behavior of the extinction curve fm fit parameters with @xmath0 . as has been found previously , we find that a small number of lmc extinction curves are consistent with the ccm relationship , but majority of the lmc and all of the smc curves do not follow the ccm relationship . for the first time , we find that the ccm relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the lmc and smc extinction curves . </S>",

    "<S> tentative evidence based on the behavior of the extinction curves with dust - to - gas ratio suggests that the continuum of dust extinction curves is possibly caused by the environmental stresses of nearby star formation activity . </S>"
