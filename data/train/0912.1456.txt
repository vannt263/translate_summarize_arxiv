    "@xmath0 and @xmath26 are expressed in terms of @xmath239 as @xmath240 it is shown in @xcite that the theory around ( [ s^3 background 2 ] ) is equivalent to planar @xmath8 sym on @xmath9 in the limit in which @xmath241 the statement can be viewed as another large @xmath0 reduction for @xmath8 sym on @xmath9 , and has passed some nontrivial tests @xcite .",
    "this background preserves the @xmath229 symmetry , so that this type of the large @xmath0 reduction gives a regularization that preserves the @xmath229 symmetry and the gauge symmetry . here",

    "the two models defined around the two backgrounds ( [ s^3 background ] ) and ( [ s^3 background 2 ] ) of pwmm belong to the same universality class .",
    "indeed , we can show that the perturbative expansion around ( [ s^3 background ] ) in the limit ( [ limit for reduced model in t^d ] ) eventually agrees with that around ( [ s^3 background 2 ] ) in the limit ( [ s^3 limit ] ) . remarkably , the two models can be put on a computer in terms of the method @xcite to study the strongly coupled regime of @xmath8 sym .",

    "while we studied ym theories in sections 4 and 5 , we can consider a chern - simons - like theory on @xmath98 defined by @xmath244 which has the @xmath128 symmetry and the @xmath175 gauge symmetry . here",
    "@xmath245 is determined by the invariance of @xmath246 under the large gauge transformations . for @xmath247 ,",
    "this agrees with pure chern - simons theory on @xmath1 . the reduced model of ( [ cs theory ] ) is given by @xmath248 repeating the arguments in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we can show that expanded around ( [ matrix background ] ) , the reduced model ( [ reduced model of cs theory ] ) retrieves the original theory ( [ cs theory ] ) in the limit ( [ limit for reduced model in t^d ] ) . in this manner",
    ", the large @xmath0 reduction holds for a wide class of gauge theories including ones in the veneziano limit , quiver gauge theories @xcite and the abjm theory @xcite .",
    "the details of the study of ( [ cs theory ] ) and ( [ reduced model of cs theory ] ) will be reported in @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath0 reduction on coset spaces @xmath249 is also an interesting problem .",
    "there is a simple prescription to obtain reduced models of scalar theories on coset spaces @xmath249 from the corresponding reduced models on @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath250 be the generators of the lie algebra of @xmath251 .",
    "the prescription is to impose a condition @xmath252=0 $ ] for all @xmath176 , or equivalently @xmath253 for arbitrary @xmath254 .",
    "this is , for instance , achieved by adding a mass term @xmath255 ^ 2 $ ] with large @xmath256 to the reduced models on @xmath98 .",
    "we will further investigate the case of other theories on @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to compact connected lie groups so far . indeed ,",
    "the argument in section 3 still holds formally for the case of non - compact connected lie groups , where the @xmath90-dimensional vector space is not needed because @xmath86 is infinite .",
    "however , to establish the large @xmath0 reduction on such group manifolds , we need to resolve a problem in infrared regularization .",
    "infinite @xmath86 gives rise to a continuous spectrum , which is not compatible with finite - size matrices .",
    "as seen in section 2 , theories on @xmath11 are obtained by an infinite volume limit of the corresponding theories on @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , a possible resolution of the above problem is to define a theory on a non - compact group by an infinite volume limit of the corresponding theory on a compact group or a coset space .",
    "we hope that our findings in this paper will lead to a progress in the problem of describing curved space - times in matrix models conjectured to give a nonperturbative formulation of superstring .",
