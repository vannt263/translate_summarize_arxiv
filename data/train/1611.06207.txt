    "the simplest version of the time - of - arrival problem in quantum mechanics @xcite is the following .",

    "a detector is located at @xmath2 . what is the probability @xmath3 that the particle is detected at @xmath2 at some moment between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ?    in spite of",
    "the problem s apparent simplicity , there is no consensus on the answer .",
    "the reason is that there exists no self - adjoint operator for time in quantum mechanics @xcite ; hence , we can not obtain an unambiguous answer by employing born s rule .",
    "several different approaches to the problem have been developed , each following a different reasoning .",
    "all approaches lead to probability densities @xmath6 that differ from each other only at the level of small quantum fluctuations , so that they can not easily be distinguished experimentally",
    ". such a distinction would be highly desirable , because the time - of - arrival problem is only an elementary manifestation of an important foundational issue , namely , understanding the role of time in quantum mechanics .",
    "the main idea of this paper is that different theories about the time - of - arrival could be distinguished if they are applied to more elaborate time - of - arrival measurements .",
    "consider , for example , a multi - particle system .",
    "the time of arrival of each particle is a distinct observable that is recorded by different detectors .",
    "the correlations between different time - of - arrival observables are in principle measurable we expect that different theories will lead to different predictions for such correlations .",
    "we implement this idea by extending the construction of time - of - arrival probabilities of ref .",
    "@xcite to set - ups that involve two or more time - of - arrival measurements .",
    "we express time - of - arrival correlations in terms of positive - operator - valued measures ( povms ) .",
    "these correlations turn out to _ differ significantly _ from ones defined in terms of probability currents .",
    "our treatment of the time of arrival is based on the quantum temporal probabilities ( qtp ) method @xcite .",
    "the qtp method provides an algorithm , applicable to any quantum system , that allows for the construction of quantum probabilities in which time is treated as a random variable . besides the time - of - arrival problem @xcite , the method has also been applied for the temporal characterization of tunneling @xcite , for calculating the response and correlations of accelerated particle detectors @xcite and to relativistic quantum measurements @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to distinguish between the time parameter of schrdinger equation from the time of occurrence of a measurement event @xcite .",
    "the latter are physical observables : they are treated as quasiclassical macroscopic variables associated to a detector s degrees of freedom , and the associated probabilities are unambiguously defined @xcite .",
    "the probability density with respect to the times of @xmath7 particle detection events is a linear functional of a @xmath8correlation functions of the associated quantum field .",
    "the simplest time - of - arrival measurement involves one particle and one detector , hence , the detection probability is a linear functional of the two - point function @xcite .",
    "the measurements considered in this paper involve two detection events ; either one detection for each particle in a bi - partite system , or two successive detections of a single particle .",
    "the associated probability densities are linear functionals of field four - point functions .",
    "our analysis proceeds as follows .",
    "first , we revisit the time - of - arrival probability measure of ref .",
    "we transform the measure to the classical state space , and study the properties of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "we find that different proposals about the time of arrival are distinguished at very low momenta ( or equivalently , very low temperatures ) : the traversed distance must be of the order of the particles thermal de broglie wave - length .",
    "second , we consider time - of - arrival measurements in bipartite particle systems . we derive the joint probability distribution for the times of arrival @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the two particles .",
    "we prove that the resulting probabilities can not , in general , be expressed in terms of probability currents .",
    "thus , we prove that different approaches to the time of arrival lead to experimentally distinguishable predictions for time - of - arrival correlations . moreover ,",
    "we show that these correlation define _",
    "entanglement witnesses_. this result suggests that quantum temporal observables can be used for the detection of entanglement and , possibly , for information processing tasks .",
    "third , we consider sequential time - of - arrival measurements on a single particle .",
    "we derive the joint probability distribution for the times of arrival @xmath9 and @xmath10 at two spatially separated detectors .",
    "we identify the rule for the change of the quantum state after a time - of - arrival measurement and show that it is very different from the usual ` state reduction ' rule .",
    "we also define an observable for the time - of - flight velocity that differs , in general , from the canonical momentum observable .    the structure of this paper in the following . in sec .",
