    "two such polygons @xmath2 and @xmath7 are _ congruent _ if there is an orientation - preserving isometry between them which sends each corner @xmath8 of @xmath2 to the corner @xmath9 of @xmath7 .",
    "polygons with @xmath10 and @xmath11 are called _ digons , triangles _ and _ quadrilaterals _ , respectively .",
    "if each side has zero geodesic curvature then @xmath2 is called a _",
    "spherical polygon_. at every corner @xmath8 , an interior angle @xmath12 is defined , and in what follows we measure all angles in half - turns .",

    "a circular quadrilateral @xmath2 whose angles are odd multiples of @xmath1 is called a _",
    "circular rectangle_. if such a quadrilateral is spherical , it is called a _ spherical rectangle_. in this paper",

    "@xcite . an important class of such metrics can be obtained by gluing a spherical polygon to its mirror image isometrically along the boundary .",
    "metrics of positive curvature on the sphere obtained in this way are characterized by the symmetry property : all conic singularities belong to a circle on the sphere , and the metric is symmetric with respect to this circle .    in this paper , we classify spherical rectangles .",
    "the cases when at least one of the angles of a spherical quadrilateral is integer were considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if we use the upper half - plane as @xmath2 , then the developing map of every circular quadrilateral is a ratio of two linearly independent solutions of the heun equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 with the standard normalization @xmath36 , @xmath37 . here",

    "different pairs of linearly independent solutions of the same equation define _ equivalent _ quadrilaterals : their developing maps are related by post - composition with linear - fractional transformations .",
    "we will later see that an equivalence class may contain at most one spherical quadrilateral , up to congruence .",
    "the condition that an equivalence class contains a spherical quadrilateral translates to the following condition on the heun equation : the projective monodromy group must be conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath39 .",
    "so the problem of classification of spherical quadrilaterals with prescribed corners and angles is equivalent to the problem of classification of heun s equation with prescribed @xmath8 and @xmath25 whose monodromy is _ unitarizable _ , that is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath39 .",
    "the correspondence between the metrics on the sphere and heun s equations with unitarizable monodromy is bijective .",

    "the condition that the monodromy of ( [ heun ] ) is unitarizable means that both periods must be imaginary , therefore the real period must vanish . for a fixed real @xmath19 , and",
