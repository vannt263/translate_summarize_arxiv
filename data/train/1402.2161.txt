    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations provide the most direct evidence for the current cosmic acceleration . in the context of einstein s general theory of relativity , this result implies either the existence of some sort of dark energy , constant or that varies slowly with time and space ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , or that the matter content of the universe is subject to dissipative processes @xcite . on the other hand , since sne ia observations are affected by at least four different sources of opacity , namely , the milky way , the hosting galaxy , intervening galaxies , and the intergalactic medium , alternative mechanisms contributing to the acceleration evidence or even mimicking the dark energy behaviour have been proposed .",
    "examples are possible evolutionary effects in sne ia events @xcite , a local hubble bubble @xcite , modified gravity @xcite , unclustered sources of light attenuation @xcite and the existence of axion - like - particles ( alps ) , arising in a wide range of well - motivated high - energy physics scenarios , and that could lead to dimming of sne ia brightness ( @xcite , for a review of the phenomenology of the weakly - interacting - sub - ev - particles ( wisps ) see @xcite ) .    in the last years",
    ", the cosmic distance duality ( cdd ) relation has been used to verify the existence of exotic physics as well as the presence of opacity and systematic errors in sne ia observations .",
    "the cdd relation connects the luminosity distance , @xmath8 , to the angular diameter distance , @xmath9 , by @xcite @xmath10 this relation is valid for all cosmological models based on riemannian geometry , requiring only that source and observer are connected by null geodesics in a riemannian spacetime , that the number of photons is conserved @xcite and narrow - beam effects are negligible @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed in the literature to test modifications of the cdd relation .",
    "for instance , @xcite used sne ia data as measurements of @xmath8 and estimates of @xmath9 from friib radio galaxies @xcite and ultra - compact radio sources @xcite to test possible deviations of the cdd relation .",
    "they found a 2@xmath11 violation caused by an excess brightening of sne ia at @xmath12 , perhaps due to lensing magnification bias .",
    "@xcite proposed a test of the cdd relation by using luminosity distances of sne ia and angular diameter distances of galaxy clusters .",
    "the verification of the cdd relation validity depended on the assumptions used to describe the galaxy clusters and the light - curve fitters used in sne ia analysis ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "still with sne ia and angular diameter distances of galaxy clusters data , @xcite explored the impact of cosmic opacity on the cosmic acceleration observation .",
    "their results suggested that an accelerated cosmic expansion is still needed to account for the dimming of sne ia and the standard cosmological scenario remains to be supported by current observations . by using four different parameterizations to possible cdd deformations and sne ia data @xcite the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that only if the cosmic opacity is fully negligible , the description of an accelerating universe powered by dark energy or some alternative gravity theory must be invoked . in ref .",
    "@xcite measurements of the expansion rate @xmath1 and union 2.1 sne ia compilation were used to impose cosmological model - independent constraints on cosmic opacity @xcite .",
    "it was found that a completely transparent universe is in agreement with the largest sne ia sample .",
    "more recently , an interesting test of the cdd relation via cosmic microwave background spectrum was proposed by @xcite . as a result",
    ", it was found that the cdd relation can not be violated by more than 0.01% between the decoupling era and today .",
    "furthemore , a cosmological model - independent test involving only measurements of the gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters from sunyaev - zeldovich and x - ray surface brightness observations was discussed by @xcite , where no significant violation of the cdd relation was found , supporting a transparent universe in the x - ray and radio wavelengths .    in face of the discussed above ,",
    "most tests of cosmic opacity have been limited in the redshift range @xmath13 . on the other hand , since current sne ia data",
    "even when combined with all other currently available data sets can not yet determine whether the energy density of dark energy is constant as required by the @xmath3cdm model or time - varying , some authors have used luminosity distances of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) to explore the universe at higher redshifts ( @xmath14 ) to understand how dark energy behaves .",
    "grbs provide a means to test cosmological models once phenomenological relations are used to transform them into stardardizable candles ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , they were used to test dark energy models @xcite and also possible bias from underdense lines of sight @xcite . in this way , in order to have confidence in analyses involving grbs it is important to verify the existence of cosmic opacity also in high redshifts .    in this paper , we probe cosmic opacity at higher redshifts through luminosity distances from grbs data , by assuming the validity of the amati relation @xcite , and with the latest 26 opacity - free measurements of the hubble expansion in the range ( @xmath15 ) using the approach proposed by avgoustidis _",
    "@xcite ( see next section to details ) .",
    "we find that grb data are in a very good agreement with a transparent universe , with bounds consistent with the ones derived with sne ia data .",
    "a possible degenerescence of the opacity constraints with the underlying cosmological model is also investigated , where it is shown that the opacity parameter @xmath16 is nearly insensitive of a different dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath7 for a flat xcdm model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the methodology . in sec .",
    "iii the observational data we use in the statistical analyses are presented .",
    "the corresponding constraints on the cosmological opacity are investigated in sec .",
    "the article is finished with a summary of the the main results in the conclusion section .",
    "[ fig1 ]    0.1 in    the methodology used in our analysis was proposed by @xcite . as pointed by these authors , the distance modulus derived from sne ia or , in our case , from grbs ,",
    "is systematically affected if there were a source of  photon absorption \" affecting the universe transparency .",
    "any effect that reduces the number of photons would dim the brightness of the source and increases its @xmath17 .",
    "thus , if @xmath18 denotes the opacity between an observer at @xmath19 and a source at @xmath20 due to , e.g. , extinction , the flux received from the source would be attenuated by a factor @xmath21 and thus the observed luminosity distance ( @xmath22 ) is related with the true luminosity distance ( @xmath23 ) by @xmath24 therefore , the _ observed _ distance modulus is given by @xcite @xmath25    as it is largely known , for a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the speed of light and @xmath28 @xmath29^{1/2}.\\ ] ] in the above expressions , @xmath30 stands for the matter density parameter measured today and @xmath7 for the dark energy equation of state parameter .",
    "if @xmath31 we have the so - called flat @xmath3cdm model .",
    "@xcite , to be able to use the full redshift range of the available data , considered the following parameterization of a deviation from the etherington relation @xmath32 , with @xmath16 parameterizing departures from transparency . to understand the physical meaning of a constraint on @xmath16 these authors argued that for small @xmath16 and @xmath33 this is equivalent to assuming an optical depth parameterization @xmath34 or @xmath35 with the correspondence @xmath36 .    in our analysis ,",
    "in order to obtain tighter limits on cosmic opacity , we consider a simple linear parameterization for @xmath37 and measurements of @xmath38 ( or @xmath22 ) are taken from the grb compilation ( see sec .",
    "iii ) to probe the cosmic opacity on a redshift range which has not been explored yet @xcite .",
    "the unknown parameters @xmath30 , @xmath16 and @xmath7 are obtained by fitting the grb data separately and jointly with @xmath1 measurements on two flat cosmic scenarios , namely , @xmath3cdm and xcdm .",
    "the basic idea behind is that while the brightness of the grb can be affected by at least four different sources of opacity ( the milky way , the hosting galaxy , intervening galaxies , and the intergalactic medium ) the @xmath1 measurements are obtained either from ages of old passively evolving galaxies and rely only on the detailed shape of the galaxy spectra but not on the galaxy luminosity or from the features in baryonic acoustic oscillation which are completely independent from the measured flux .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 values are not affected by a non - zero @xmath18 since @xmath39 is assumed not to be strongly wavelength dependent in the optical band . in order to compare and update previous results , we also consider sne ia observations from the union2.1 sample @xcite , where we add the most distant ( @xmath5 ) spectroscopically confirmed sne ia @xcite .",
    "grbs are the most violent explosions of the universe . due to their brightness",
    ", they are measured up to very far distances , where the most distant grb was detected at @xmath40 @xcite ( a photometric determination of the redshift of a grb at @xmath41 was also claimed @xcite ) .",
    "this is far beyond what is covered by sne ia , which reach @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the possibility to use grbs as standardized candles may allow cosmology tests to be performed in a redshift region not probed by any other sources .    in order to do so , many phenomenological relations to calibrate grbs for cosmological purposes appeared in the literature , where one of the most successful proposals is known as the amati relation @xcite .",
    "it relates the isotropic - equivalent radiated energy in gamma - rays @xmath43 and the photon energy at which the @xmath44 is brightest @xmath45 , @xmath46 standing for the frequency and @xmath47 for the flux at frequency @xmath46 .",
    "the amati relation can be expressed by a power law : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the cosmological rest - frame peak energy and @xmath50 is given by    @xmath51    @xmath52 denoting the bolometric fluence in gamma - rays in a given grb .",
    "unfortunately , the grbs detected at very low redshifts seem to belong to a different class of objects when compared to their high - redshift counterparts , which makes the calibration process tricky .",
    "one way around this problem was proposed by @xcite and @xcite , which consists of using sne ia to calibrate the grbs .",
    "the method was updated by wei @xcite , who used the 557 sne ia from the union2 sample @xcite and 109 grbs . for each grb which is in the same redshift range of the sne ia , @xmath53 , were found the four closest sne ia and a cubic interpolation was applied to derive its distance modulus .",
    "once the 50 grbs in this redshift range had their distance modulus determined , a fit was performed to obtain the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the amati relation , which in its turn allowed one to derive the distances for the remaining high - redshift grbs . after this process",
    ", we are left with 59 grbs with @xmath56 which can be used for cosmological purposes ( shown in fig . 1a as blue diamonds ) .",
    "note that the grbs are calibrated with the sne ia without a correction for the opacity in sne ia data .",
    "therefore , if a non - zero opacity is present its effect should become even stronger when analyzing the grb data .    at this point , it is important to remember that grbs do not have the same status of other cosmological probes ( e.g. sne ia , baryon acoustic oscillations , cosmic microwave background anisotropies ) .",
    "this is due to our poor knowledge of the physical processes driving the explosion .",
    "for example , there is a strong debate in the literature concerning whether the amati relation is an intrinsic property of grbs or merely a combination of selection effects ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite detected a strong evolution in the luminosity function of grbs .",
    "this may indicate that grbs are intrinsically more luminous at high redshifts .",
    "since we used the low - redshift grbs to calibrate the high - redshift ones , we would infer a smaller distance to the grb , so a smaller value for the opacity .",
    "therefore , if this effect is important we are underestimating the opacity .      in recent years",
    "@xmath1 measurements of the hubble parameter have been used to constrain several cosmological parameters @xcite . in this paper , we use 19 @xmath1 measurements from cosmic chonometers @xcite plus 7 @xmath1 measurements from baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) @xcite in the redshift range @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 influence on our results is explored by considering a prior in the analysis : @xmath59 km s@xmath60 mpc@xmath60 , from a median statistics analysis of 553 measurements of @xmath58 @xcite , consistent with the value derived recently by _ planck _",
