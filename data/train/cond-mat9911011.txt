    "strong evidence for a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) was observed in si metal - oxid - semiconductor ( mos ) structures @xcite and other two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking features of this phenomenon is a strong exponential drop of the resistivity @xmath1 which saturates at low temperatures . according to scaling arguments for non - interacting 2d electron systems no such mit",
    "was expected @xcite . however , for interacting 2d systems , theoretical evaluation showed that the mit in 2d is not forbidden by basic arguments @xcite . now the central question about the mit in 2d concerns its origin .",
    "if electron - electron interaction is responsible for the strong decrease in resistivity , then quantum effects should dominate the metallic regime @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the scattering mechanism across a spin gap @xcite or the sharp crossover from quantum to classical transport @xcite takes place , then the transport properties should not be dominated by quantum effects but should be rather explainable by the classical boltzmann transport behavior .",
    "we have thus investigated the negative magnetoresistance due to the weak - localization effect @xcite in order to get information about the phase coherence time @xmath2 in a regime where possibly electron - electron interactions cause the anomalous metallic state . for carrier densities around the critical concentration @xmath3",
    ", conductivity corrections from single electron backscattering and interaction effects in the electron - electron and electron - hole channels overlap @xcite and it is not possible to get an unambiguous value for the phase coherence time .",
    "therefore our investigations were focused on the high carrier density regime with conductance @xmath4 between 35 and 120 , where the strong exponential drop in resistivity has shifted to higher temperatures and weak @xmath5 terms with both , negative and positive sign dominate the behavior @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the negative magnetoresistance due to weak localization is restricted to a narrow range of magnetic fields and can be evaluated under the assumption that the interaction terms have only small influence on the negative magnetoresistance .",
    "our investigations were performed on two high - mobility si - mos samples si-43 and si-15 with peak mobilities of @xmath6 and 32,000@xmath7/vs , respectively .",
    "the samples consist of 5 mm long and 0.8 mm wide hall bars , covered with a 200 nm thick si - oxide layer serving as an insulator and a 1000 nm thick al - gate on top .",
    "the resistivity and hall measurements were performed in a four terminal ac - technique at a frequency of 19hz .",
    "the magnetoresistivity measurements were performed on sample si-43 at electron densities @xmath8 from @xmath9 to @xmath10@xmath11 and temperatures @xmath12 between 0.29 and 10k and on sample si-15 for @xmath13@xmath11 and @xmath14k . in this density range",
    ", the conductance @xmath15 is between 35 and 120 , which is just the region below the maximum metallic conductivity in these si - mos structures @xcite .",
    "the open circles in fig .",
    "1 represent the negative magnetoresistance @xmath16 at a density of @xmath17@xmath11 at different temperatures for si-15 .",
    "the negative magnetoresistance was fitted to the single - electron weak localization correction to conductivity @xcite @xmath18 , \\label{eq : wl}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the digamma function , @xmath20 is the applied perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath21 the diffusion coefficient and @xmath22 the momentum relaxation time .",
    "the values for @xmath21 and @xmath22 were deduced from the temperature and density dependent hall and resistivity measurements .",
    "the prefactor @xmath23 describes the valley degeneracy and @xmath24 depends , according to theory @xcite , on the ratio of intra - valley to inter - valley scattering rates and should be between 0.5 and 1 .",
    "we found values between 0.5 and 0.6 for @xmath24 , which is in the expected range .",
    "the full lines in fig .  1 represent the best least square fits through the data points according to eq .  1 for the different temperatures .",
    "the influence of stray magnetic fields was tested by carefully shielding the sample together with a copper coil by a @xmath25-metal foil for temperatures down to 100mk . as no influence was observed , we conclude that the width and height of the weak localization peak is not disturbed by any background magnetic fields . we also have not seen any sign for a superconducting state of the 2d electron gas which might be disturbed by very small magnetic fields .    in fig .  2 , the temperature dependence of the phase coherence time @xmath2 is shown for several carrier densities in the range from @xmath9 to @xmath26@xmath11 for si-43 .",
    "it is found that @xmath2 increases by about a factor of 100 from 1ps at 10k to nearly 100ps at 0.29k .",
    "similar values for @xmath2 were also reported for earlier investigations on si - mos structures @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath2 can be described approximately by a power law @xmath27 . at higher temperatures , large momentum transfer processes",
    "dominate the electron - electron scattering and @xmath28 is expected , whereas at low temperatures , small momentum transfer dominates in disordered systems even for @xmath29 and cause @xmath30 @xcite .    according to the data in fig .  2",
    ", @xmath31 is decreasing slightly from 1.4 above 4k to 1.3 below 1k for the lowest density , whereas @xmath31 shows a strong change from 1.5 towards 0.5 in the same temperature interval for the highest density .",
    "the latter value of 0.5 can not be explained by theory and the strong change in the slope of fig .",
    "2 indicates rather a saturation of the phase coherence time below 0.3k .",
    "such a saturation of @xmath2 can be caused by electron heating effects due to high frequency noise or by other processes which limit the height of the weak localization effect . according to hikami",
    "@xcite , such a limitation can be caused by spin scattering due to magnetic impurities or spin - orbit interaction . from the additional terms for spin scattering and spin - orbit scattering , which enter ( 1 ) ,",
    "such a limiting scattering time can be estimated to be around 200ps . but from the available data",
    "no definite conclusion about the process , which limits @xmath2 , can be drawn .    in the temperature range where @xmath2 increases by about a factor 100 ,",
    "the resistivity of the sample is nearly constant . especially for the highest density of @xmath32@xmath11 , the exponentially strong changes in the conductivity , which where observed below 1k for densities near the mit , have shifted to temperatures above 10k .",
    "only weak changes @xmath33 remain at small @xmath12 @xcite despite the strong increase of @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 on the carrier concentration is depicted in fig .",
    "3 . for temperatures in the range from 1 to 10.7k , @xmath2 increases with increasing carrier concentration .",
    "below @xmath34@xmath11 , this increase is steep , whereas for higher densities the increase becomes smaller . at a temperature of 0.29k , @xmath2 increases as well below @xmath34@xmath11 , but decreases slightly for higher concentrations .",
    "this abnormal behavior at 0.29k can be assigned to the observed saturation of @xmath2 in the temperature dependence for higher densities as described above .",
    "the same investigations for sample si-15 showed a very similar behavior of the phase coherence time @xmath2 with saturation effects near @xmath35 .    in fig .",
    "3 the momentum relaxation time @xmath22 is shown for comparison .",
    "it was calculated from the conductivity @xmath36 at @xmath37 as @xmath38 with @xmath39 the transversal effective mass and @xmath8 the carrier density as derived from the hall coefficient @xmath40 . as the magnetoresisitivity due to weak localization is a very small effect ( @xmath41 )",
    ", there is practically no difference whether @xmath22 is calculated at @xmath42 or at @xmath43 . from fig .",
    "3 , it can be seen that the overall behavior of @xmath2 and @xmath22 is quite different and independent of each other .",
    "this can be understood by the different underlying scattering mechanisms for inelastic and elastic processes .",
    "the elastic processes are due to impurity and surface roughness scattering whereas the inelastic processes are caused by electron - phonon and electron - electron scattering .",
    "it should be noted that we observe a negative magnetoresistance within @xmath44 gauss despite the fact that there is a superconducting al - gate on top of the si - mos structures .",
    "bulk al is a type i superconductor with a critical superconducting temperature of @xmath45k and a critical magnetic field of @xmath46 g .",
    "we have tested the superconductivity of our al - gate directly by performing a fore - wire resistance measurement .",
    "we found a sudden decrease of the resistivity to zero at a temperature of 1.20k . at 0.29k ,",
    "the zero - resistivity could be quenched by an external magnetic field of 51 g .",
    "the deviation of this field from @xmath47 is caused by the intermediate state which has a finite resitivity when the superconducting regions are not connected any more @xcite .",
    "in addition , the superconducting properties may be modified as the al - gate consists of a thin evaporated layer which is expected to be strongly disordered .",
    "the effect of a superconducting gate on the weak localization was treated in detail by rammer and shelankov @xcite . at magnetic fields below @xmath47 ,",
    "the magnetic flux is collected in the flux tubes of the intermediate state . at the position of the 2d electron gas , 200 nm away from the superconducting gate",
    ", the nonuniformity of the magnetic field persists only if the period of the magnetic structure is larger than this distance .",
    "the characteristic lateral size of the domains in the intermediate state can be estimated from the laminar model @xcite . for pure al ,",
    "one gets a period @xmath48 of about 300 nm , whereas for a strongly disordered material a period of rather 80 nm is expected .",
    "this domain period has to be compared with the phase coherence length @xmath49 , with @xmath21 the diffusion coefficient . from our investigations",
    "it follows that @xmath50 is in the range from 600 to 1000 nm at temperatures below @xmath51k . as this range of values is much larger than the typical domain period @xmath48",
    ", no influence of the superconducting gate on the negative magnetoresistivity is expected @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with our measurements , where we have observed no direct influence .",
    "we have investigated the weak localization in the metallic regime of si - mos structures at high carrier density where the conductance is between 35 and 120 @xmath0 . when decreasing the temperature from 10 to 0.29k , the phase coherence time @xmath2 increases from 2 to about 100ps enabling in principle strong quantum effects to take place .",
    "nevertheless , only weak @xmath5 type changes of the conductivity were observed from 10k where the phase coherence is as short as the momentum relaxation time down to 0.29k where @xmath2 is about 100 times larger .",
    "we thus conclude that in the investigated high conductance regime no strong quantum effects due to electron - electron interaction take place which could drive the system into the metallic state . from saturation effects of @xmath2 , we can estimate a lower boundary for the spin - orbit interaction scattering time of about 200ps .",
