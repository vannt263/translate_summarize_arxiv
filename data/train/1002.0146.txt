    "the interaction of hadrons in nuclei is a problem that goes to the very core of nuclear physics .",
    "in fact , our present knowledge of the nuclear force in free space is , in itself , the result of decades of struggle,@xcite which will not be reviewed in this article .",
    "the nature of the nuclear force in the medium is of course a much more complex problem , as it involves aspects of the force that can not be constrained through free - space nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering .",
    "predictions of properties of nuclei are the ultimate test for many - body theories .",
    "nuclear matter is an alternative and convenient theoretical laboratory for many - body theories . by",
    " nuclear matter \" we mean an infinite system of nucleons acted on by their mutual strong forces and no electromagnetic interactions .",
    "nuclear matter is characterized by its energy / particle as a function of density and other thermodynamic quantities , if appropriate ( e.g.  temperature ) .",
    "such relation is known as the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the translational invariance of the system facilitates theoretical calculations . at the same time , adopting what is known as  local density approximation \" , one can use the eos directly in calculations of finite systems .",
    "this procedure is applied , for instance , in thomas - fermi calculations within the liquid drop model , where an appropriate energy functional is written in terms of the eos.@xcite    symmetric nuclear matter ( that is , matter with equal densities of protons and neutrons ) has been studied extensively .",
    "the so - called conventional approach goes back to earlier works by brueckner and others@xcite and is known as the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory .",
    "the brueckner theory is based on a linked - cluster perturbation series of the ground state energy of a many - body system.@xcite such series was shown to converge when the cluster diagrams are regrouped according to the number of hole lines .",
    "the variational approach was also pursued as an alternative method@xcite and yielded predictions in close agreement with those from brueckner theory when realistic nn potentials were employed.@xcite    during the 1980 s , the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach was developed.@xcite the main break - through came with the observation that the dbhf theory , unlike conventional brueckner theory , could describe successfully the saturation properties of nuclear matter , that is , saturation energy and density of the equation of state .",
    "the dbhf method adopts realistic nn interactions and contains important relativistic features .",
    "it describes the nuclear mean field in terms of strong , competing scalar and vector fields that , together , account for the binding of nucleons as well as the large spin - orbit splitting seen in nuclear states .",
    "regardless of the chosen many - body theory , a quantitative nn potential should be part of its input .",
    "recently , chiral effective theories of the nuclear force@xcite have become popular as a mean to respect the symmetries of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) while retaining the basic degrees of freedom typical of low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "chiral effective theories provide a well - defined scheme to determine the appropriate many - body diagrams to be included at each order of the perturbation .",
    "however , being based on a low - momentum expansion , interactions derived from chiral perturbation theory are not suitable for applications in dense nuclear / neutron matter , where high fermi momenta are involved . instead , meson - theoretic or phenomenological nn potentials",
    "are typically employed as input to the many - body theory .",
    "mean - field models ( relativistic and non - relativistic ) are a popular , although non - microscopic , alternative to methods based on the in - medium reaction matrix , such as bhf and dbhf .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to review the status of microscopic studies of nuclear and neutron - rich matter , with particular emphasis on the latter , as it relates to present empirical investigations within terrestrial laboratories ( heavy - ion collisions ) or astrophysical observations ( neutron stars ) . at the same time",
    ", we will review the present status concerning available empirical information which can be utilized to guide and constrain theories .",
    "we also wish to provide a self - contained account of the recent work with asymmetric matter done by the idaho group , including extensive numerical tables for the interested user .",
    "clearly , the goal to describe the properties of ( dense ) many - body systems consistently from the underlying forces _ and _ including all potentially important mechanisms , is a most ambitious program and far from having been completed .",
    "the importance of pursuing a microscopic approach towards the accomplishment of this goal is a theme that will surface repeatedly throughout this article .",
    "isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter ( ianm ) simulates the interior of a  nucleus \" with unequal densities of protons and neutrons .",
    "the equation of state of ( cold ) ianm is then a function of density as well as the relative concentrations of protons and neutrons .",
    "the recent and fast - growing interest in ianm stems from its close connection to neutron - rich nuclei , or , more generally , asymmetric nuclei , including the very ",
    "exotic \" ones known as  halo \" nuclei . at this time , the boundaries of the nuclear chart are uncertain , with a few hundreds stable nuclides known to exist and perhaps a few thousands believed to exist . the facility for rare isotope beams ( frib ) has recently been approved for design and construction at michigan state university ( msu ) . the facility will deliver intense beams of rare isotopes , the study of which can provide crucial information on short - lived elements normally not found on earth.@xcite thus , this new experimental program will have widespread impact , ranging from the origin of elements to the evolution of the cosmos .",
    "it is estimated that the design and construction of frib will take ten years.@xcite in the meantime , systematic investigations to determine the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter are proliferating at existing facilities .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "some older studies of ianm can be found in refs.@xcite interactions adjusted to fit properties of finite nuclei , such as those based on the non - relativistic skyrme hartree - fock theory@xcite or the relativistic mean field theory,@xcite have been used to extract phenomenological eos .",
    "variational calculations of asymmetric matter have also been reported.@xcite fuchs _",
    "et al._@xcite defined a lorentz invariant functional of the baryon field operators to project dirac - brueckner nuclear matter results onto the meson - nucleon vertices of an effective density - dependent field theory .",
    "this was then applied to asymmetric matter and finite nuclei in hartree calculations.@xcite extensive work with ianm has also been reported by lombardo and collaborators.@xcite dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations of ianm properties were performed by the oslo group,@xcite the idaho group,@xcite and by fuchs and collaborators.@xcite typically , considerable model dependence is observed among the different eos of ianm , especially in the high - density region .",
    "asymmetric nuclear matter can be characterized by the neutron density , @xmath0 , and the proton density , @xmath1 , defined as the number of neutrons or protons per unit of volume . in infinite matter",
    ", they are obtained by summing the neutron or proton states per volume ( up to their respective fermi momenta , @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) and applying the appropriate degeneracy factor .",
    "the result is @xmath4 with @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "it is more convenient to refer to the total density @xmath7 and the asymmetry ( or neutron excess ) parameter @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , @xmath9=0 corresponds to symmetric matter and @xmath9=1 to neutron matter . in terms of @xmath9 and the average fermi momentum ,",
    "@xmath10 , related to the total density in the usual way , @xmath11 the neutron and proton fermi momenta can be expressed as @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the energy / particle in ianm can , to a very good degree of approximation , be written as @xmath14 where the first term is the energy / particle in symmetric matter and @xmath15 is known as the symmetry energy . in the bethe - weizs \" acker formula for the nuclear binding energy , it represents the amount of binding a nucleus has to lose when the numbers of protons and neutrons are unequal .",
    "the symmetry energy is also closely related to the neutron @xmath16-decay in dense matter , whose threshold depends on the proton fraction .",
    "a typical value for @xmath15 at nuclear matter density ( @xmath17 ) is 30 mev , with theoretical predictions spreading approximately between 26 and 35 mev .",
    "the effect of a term of fourth order in the asymmetry parameter ( @xmath18 ) on the bulk properties of neutron stars is very small , although it may impact the proton fraction at high density .",
    "more generally , non - quadratic terms are usually associated with isovector pairing , which is a surface effect and thus vanishes in infinite matter.@xcite    equation  ( [ e ] ) displays a convenient separation between the symmetric and aymmetric parts of the eos , which facilitates the identification of observables that may be sensitive , for instance , mainly to the symmetry energy . at this time , groups from gsi,@xcite msu,@xcite italy,@xcite france,@xcite and china@xcite are investigating the density dependence of the symmetry energy through heavy - ion collisions . from recent results , such as those reported at the 2009  international workshop on nuclear dynamics in heavy - ion reactions and the symmetry energy \" ( shanghai , china , august 22 - 25 , 2009 ) , these investigations appear to agree reasonably well on the following parametrization of the symmetry energy : @xmath19 where the first term is the kinetic contribution and @xmath20 ( the exponent appearing in the potential energy part ) is found to be between 0.4 and 1.0 . naturally , there are uncertainties associated with all transport models .",
    "recent constraints from msu@xcite were extracted from simulations of @xmath21sn and @xmath22sn collisions with an improved quantum molecular dynamics transport model and are consistent with isospin diffusion data and the ratio of neutron and proton spectra .    typically , parametrizations like the one given in eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) are valid at or below the saturation density , @xmath17 .",
    "efforts to constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at higher densities are presently being pursued through observables such as @xmath23 ratio , @xmath24 ratio , neutron / proton differential transverse flow , or nucleon elliptic flow.@xcite    a more detailed discussion of the symmetry energy and the status of its theoretical predictions will be presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we present a discussion of the microscopic approach to nuclear matter , in general , and the dbhf method , in particular .      by _ ab initio",
    "_ we mean that the starting point of the many - body calculation is a realistic nn interaction which is then applied in the nuclear medium without any additional free parameters .",
    "thus the first question to be confronted concerns the choice of the  best \" nn interaction .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , after the development of qcd and the understanding of its symmetries , chiral effective theories@xcite were developed as a way to respect the symmetries of qcd while keeping the degrees of freedom ( nucleons and pions ) typical of low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "however , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) has definite limitations as far as the range of allowed momenta is concerned . for the purpose of applications in dense matter ,",
    "where higher and higher momenta become involved with increasing fermi momentum , nn potentials based on chpt are unsuitable .",
    "relativistic meson theory is an appropriate framework to deal with the high momenta encountered in dense matter . in particular",
    ", the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model has proven very successful in describing nn data in free space and has a good theoretical foundation . among the many available obe potentials , some being part of the  high - precision generation\",@xcite we seek a momentum - space potential developed within a relativistic scattering equation , such as the one obtained through the thompson@xcite three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation.@xcite furthermore",
    ", we require a potential that uses the pseudovector coupling for the interaction of nucleons with pseudoscalar mesons . with these constraints in mind , as well as",
    "the requirement of a good description of the nn data , bonn b@xcite is a reasonable choice .",
    "as is well known , the nn potential model dependence of nuclear matter predictions is not negligible .",
    "the saturation points obtained with different nn potentials move along the famous  coester band \" depending on the strength of the tensor force , with the weakest tensor force yielding the largest attraction .",
    "this can be understood in terms of medium effects ( particularly pauli blocking ) reducing the ( attractive ) second - order term in the expansion of the reaction matrix .",
    "a large second - order term will undergo a large reduction in the medium .",
    "therefore , noticing that the second - order term is dominated by the tensor component of the force , nuclear potentials with a strong tensor component will yield less attraction in the medium .",
    "for the same reason ( that is , the role of the tensor force in nuclear matter ) , the potential model dependence is strongly reduced in pure ( or nearly pure ) neutron matter , due to the absence of isospin - zero partial waves .",
    "already when qcd ( and its symmetries ) were unknown , it was observed that the contribution from the nucleon - antinucleon pair diagram , fig .",
    "[ 2b ] , becomes unreasonably large if the pseudoscalar ( ps ) coupling is used , leading to very large pion - nucleon scattering lengths.@xcite we recall that the lagrangian density for pseudoscalar coupling of the nucleon field ( @xmath25 ) with the pseudoscalar meson field ( @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 on the other hand , the same contribution ( fig .  [ 2b ] ) is heavily reduced by the pseudovector ( pv ) coupling ( a mechanism which became known as  pair suppression \" ) .",
    "the reason for the suppression is the presence of the covariant derivative at the pseudovector vertex , @xmath28 which reduces the contribution of the vertex for low momenta and , thus , explains the small value of the pion - nucleon scattering length at threshold.@xcite considerations based on chiral symmetry@xcite can further motivate the choice of the pseudovector coupling .    in closing this section",
    ", we wish to highlight the most important aspect of the  _ ab initio _ \"",
    "approach : namely , the only free parameters of the model ( the parameters of the nn potential ) are determined by fitting the free - space nn data and never readjusted in the medium . in other words , the model parameters are tightly constrained and the calculation in the medium is parameter free .",
    "the presence of free parameters in the medium would generate effects and sensitivities which are hard to control and interfere with the predictive power of the theory .",
    "the main strength of the dbhf approach is in its inherent ability to account for important three - body forces through its density dependence . in fig .",
    "[ 3b ] we show a three - body force ( tbf ) originating from virtual excitation of a nucleon - antinucleon pair , known as ",
    "z - diagram \" .",
    "notice that the observations from the previous section ensure that the corresponding diagram at the two - body level , fig .",
    "[ 2b ] , is moderate in size when the pv coupling is used .",
    "the main feature of the dbhf method turns out to be closely related to the tbf depicted in fig .",
    "[ 3b ] , as we will argue next . in the dbhf approach",
    ", one describes the positive energy solutions of the dirac equation in the medium as @xmath29 where the effective mass , @xmath30 , is defined as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 an attractive scalar potential .",
    "( this will be derived below . )",
    "it can be shown that both the description of a single - nucleon via eq .",
    "( [ ustar ] ) and the evaluation of the z - diagram , fig .",
    "[ 3b ] , generate a repulsive effect on the energy / particle in symmetric nuclear matter which depends on the density approximately as @xmath33 and provides the saturating mechanism missing from conventional brueckner calculations .",
    "( alternatively , explicit tbf are used along with the bhf method in order to achieve a similar result . )",
    "brown showed that the bulk of the desired effect can be obtained as a lowest order ( in @xmath34 ) relativistic correction to the single - particle propagation.@xcite with the in - medium spinor as in eq .",
    "( [ ustar ] ) , the correction to the free - space spinor can be written approximately as @xmath35 where for simplicity the spinor normalization factor has been set equal to 1 , in which case it is clearly seen that the entire effect originates from the modification of the spinor s lower component . by expanding the single - particle energy to order @xmath36 , brown showed that the correction to the energy consistent with eq .",
    "( [ delu ] ) can be written as @xmath37 .",
    "he then proceeded to estimate the correction to the energy / particle and found it to be approximately as given in eq .",
    "( [ dele ] ) .    the approximate equivalence of the effective - mass description of dirac states and the contribution from the z - diagram has a simple intuitive explanation in the observation that eq .",
    "( [ ustar ] ) , like any other solution of the dirac equation , can be written as a superposition of positive and negative energy solutions .",
    "on the other hand , the  nucleon \" in the middle of the z - diagram , fig .",
    "[ 3b ] , is precisely a superposition of positive and negative energy states . in summary",
    ", the dbhf method effectively takes into account a particular class of tbf , which are crucial for nuclear matter saturation .",
    "of course , other , more popular , three - body forces ( not included in dbhf ) need to be addressed as well .",
    "figure  [ delta ] shows the tbf that is included in essentially all tbf models , regardless other components ; it is the fujita - miyazawa tbf.@xcite with the addition of contributions from @xmath38 s - waves , one ends up with the well - known tucson - melbourne tbf.@xcite the microscopic tbf of ref.@xcite includes contributions from excitation of the roper resonance ( p@xmath39 isobar ) as well .",
    "now , if diagrams such as the one shown on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ delta ] are taken into account , consistency requires that medium modifications at the corresponding two - body level are also included , that is , the diagram on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ delta ] should be present and properly medium modified .",
    "large cancellations then take place , a fact that was brought up a long time ago.@xcite when the two - body sector is handled via obe diagrams , the two - pion exchange is effectively incorporated through the @xmath40  meson \" , which can not generate the ( large ) medium effects ( dispersion and pauli blocking on @xmath41 intermediate states ) required by the consistency arguments presented above .",
    "thus , caution needs to be exercised when applying tbf in a particular space ( of nucleons only , or nucleons and @xmath41 ) .",
    "having first summarized the main dbhf philosophy , we now proceed to describe the dbhf calculation of ianm.@xcite in the end , this will take us back to the crucial point of the dbhf approximation , eq .",
    "( [ ustar ] ) .",

    "the goal is to determine self - consistently the nuclear matter single - particle potential which , for ianm , will be different for neutrons and protons . to facilitate the description of the procedure , we will use a schematic notation for the neutron / proton potential .",

    "the size of @xmath190 changes from model to model in line with the size of the maximum mass , see fig .  [ if ] .",
    "lastly , we calculate the gravitational redshift predicted by each model . the redshift is given by @xmath191 this simple formula can be derived considering a photon emitted at the surface of a neutron star and moving towards a detector located at large distance.@xcite the photon frequency at the emitter ( receiver ) is the inverse of the proper time between two wave crests in the frame of the emitter ( receiver ) . assuming a static gravitational field , and writing @xmath192 as the metric tensor component at the surface of a nonrotating star yield the equation above .",
    "naturally the rotation of the star modifies the metric , and in that case different considerations need to be applied which result in a frequency dependence of the redshift .",
    "we will not consider the general case here .    from fig .",
    "[ z ] , it appears that the gravitational redshift is not very eos - dependent ( compare , for instance , the values at the maximum mass for each model ) , an indication that the gravitational profile at the surface of the star is similar in all models .",
    "thus measurements of @xmath193 may not be the best way to discriminate among different eos .",
    "clearly , at the densities probed by the interior of neutron stars the model dependence is large , but presently available constraints are still insufficient to discriminate among these eos . at very high density ( @xmath95 between five and ten times normal density ) , the most repulsive _ symmetric matter _ energies are produced with bob , v18 , dbhf , n93 and uix , in that order .",
    "this explains the maximum mass predictions , which depend mostly on the absolute repulsion present in the symmetric matter eos .",

    "this indicates a somewhat different balance of attraction / repulsion when only t=1 contributions are included .",
    "the symmetry energy , see fig .",
    "[ esmicro ] , which depends entirely on the repulsion of neutron matter _ relative _ to symmetric matter and whose density dependence controls observables such as the neutron skin , is largest in n93 , followed by bob , v18 , uix , and dbhf .",
    "the model dependence we observe comes from two sources , the two - body potential and the many - body approach , specifically the presence of explicit tbf or dirac effects .",
    "the dependence on the two - body potential is very large .",
    "typically , the main source of model dependence among nn potentials is found in the strength of the tensor force .",
    "of course , differences at the two - body level impact the tbf as well , whether they are microscopic or phenomenological ( as in the case of uix ) .    on the other hand , when comparing dbhf and bob , we are looking at differences stemming from the many - body scheme , as the two models share the same nn potential .",
    "in the bob model , repulsion grows at a much faster rate than in dbhf , and more strongly so in neutron matter .",
    "( hence , the much larger symmetry energy with bob ) . as an example , at about 6 times normal density the dbhf energy of symmetric matter is 67% of the bob energy and only 51% at ten times normal densities . in pure neutron matter , those ratios become 49% and 30% , respectively .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the microscopic tbf in the bhf model introduces considerable more repulsion than the dirac effects through highly non - linear terms.@xcite both attractive and repulsive tbf are required for a realistic description of the saturation point .",
    "the density dependence of the repulsive terms is obviously stronger and thus dominates at high density .",
    "furthermore , it appears that this is especially true in neutron matter .",
    "in ref.@xcite it is shown that the largest contribution to the net tbf originates from z - diagrams such as shown in fig .  2 , a fact which confirms the validity of the dbhf approximation .",
    "the actual amount of repulsion , however , seems to depend sensitively upon the tbf parametrization .",
    "one of the advantages of the dbhf method is the ability to avoid possible inconsistencies between the parameters of the two- and the three - body systems .    at this time",
    ", available constraints can not pin down the high - density behavior of the eos .",
    "nevertheless , we argue again that microscopic models allow for a deeper insight into the origin of the observed physical effects , and should be pursued along with improved constraints .",
    "at densities close to normal nuclear density , protons and neutrons are the only baryonic degrees of freedom . as density increases ,",
    "other baryons begin to appear , such as strange baryons or isospin 3/2 nucleon resonances .",
    "hyperonic states can be classified according to the irreducible representation of the @xmath194 group .",
    "the octet of baryons that can appear in neutron matter includes nucleons , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 .    neglecting the nucleon - hyperon interaction , the threshold for stable hyperons to exist in matter",
    "is determined by comparing the hyperon mass with the neutron fermi energy , which is the largest available energy scale in neutron - rich matter .",
    "we consider cold neutron stars , after neutrinos have escaped .",
    "strange baryons appear at about 2 - 3 times normal density,@xcite an estimate which is essentially model independent , through the processes @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the equilibrium conditions for these reactions are @xmath200 also , we have @xmath201 the equations above being special cases of @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are the baryon number and the charge ( in units of the electron charge ) of the particular species with chemical potential @xmath205 . together with the charge neutrality condition and baryon number conservation , @xmath206 the above system allows to determine the various particle fractions .",
    "clearly , the composition of matter at supra - nuclear densities determines the behavior of stellar matter .",
    "it is also speculated that a transition to a quark phase may take place at very high densities , the occurrence of which depends sensitively on the properties of the eos in the hadronic ( confined ) phase .",
    "the presence of hyperons in the interior of neutron stars is reported to soften the equation of state , with the consequence that the predicted neutron star maximum masses become considerably smaller.@xcite with recent constraints allowing maximum masses larger than previously accepted limits ( see previous section ) , accurate microscopic calculations which include strangeness ( in addition to other important effects , such as those originating from relativity ) , become especially timely .",
    "thus , there are strong motivations for including strange baryons in nuclear matter . moreover , as far as terrestrial nuclear physics is concerned , studies of hyperon energies in nuclear matter naturally complement our knowledge of hypernuclei ( see , for instance , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "for example , the eos of hypermatter is useful in the development of generalized mass formulas depending on both density and hyperon fraction.@xcite from the experimental side , additional data are very much needed , especially on @xmath207 hypernuclei , which would provide information on the @xmath208 interaction .",
    "concerning single hypernuclei , analyses of data on @xmath195 binding energies constrain the depth of the single-@xmath195 potential to be 27 - 30 mev.@xcite the status of @xmath209 hypernuclei and the @xmath209-nucleus potential is more controversial ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interacting hypernuclear matter was initially studied within variational approaches.@xcite relativistic mean field models were also extended to include hyperons.@xcite microscopic models require inclusion of realistic nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon interactions,@xcite but the experimental information on these interactions is still scarce .",

    "the information on the hyperon - hyperon interaction is limited to the ground state of double-@xmath195 hypernuclei.@xcite additional constraints can be derived from @xmath194 symmetry arguments .",
    "the common denominator among microscopic calculations of the eos with hyperons is that they are typically conducted within a non - relativistic framework together with r - space local nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) potentials .",
    "microscopic calculations of nuclear matter properties including hyperons have been reported earlier within the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock framework ( bhf ) ( see , for instance , refs.@xcite ) , using the nijmegen@xcite nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) meson - exchange potential .",
    "extensive microscopic work on hyperonic nuclear matter , again within the non - relativistic bhf framework , has also been published by the barcelona group ( see , for instance , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the issue of interacting hyperons and their impact on the @xmath16-stable eos and neutron star structure has been confronted , for instance , in ref.@xcite using the paris@xcite and the argonne v18@xcite nn potentials together with the nijmegen soft - core ( nsc89 ) ny potential.@xcite a remarkable conclusion from that work is that , in the presence of hyperons , the inclusion of nucleonic tbf does not alter the eos appreciably . with nucleons only , tbf bring in considerable repulsion at high density which result in a much stiffer eos . on the other hand , when hyperons are present the nucleonic tbf increase the strange baryon population due to the increased nucleon chemical potential",
    "in turn , this decreases the nucleon population with the final net effect on the eos found to be very small .",
    "in other words , it would be necessary for the ny interaction to become very repulsive at high density to compensate for the loss of nucleons and gain a substantial increase of the star maximum mass.@xcite results for the neutron star maximum gravitational mass , radius , and central density are shown in table  6 .",
    "the use of different nn potentials seem to produce only small variations .",
    ".neutron star limiting values for different eos with ( y ) and without ( no y ) hyperons as from ref.@xmath212 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     more recently , neutron star structure results have been revisited by the catania group with the microscopic models we considered earlier in this article ( bhf+tbf models from ref.@xcite ) along with the nsc89 nucleon - hyperon interaction.@xcite there , the nucleonic energy densities obtained with the different nn interactions are used together with the same ny interaction to calculate stellar matter .",
    "it is found that the inclusion of hyperons reduces dramatically the maximum mass .",
    "it also reduces substantially the maximum mass range covered by the models , which goes from 1.8 to 2.5  @xmath174 with nucleonic energy densities only , see fig .  [ mr ] , to the much narrower intervals of 1.3 - 1.4  @xmath174 .",
    "furthermore , the stiffer the original eos , the larger the softening effect from the presence of strangeness .",
    "thus , in this approach , one may conclude that hybrid stars ( containing hadronic and quark matter ) are necessary to reproduce the larger mass values consistent with recent observations .",
    "overall , there seems to be a consensus among microscopic calculations of the bhf type ( with or without tbf ) that the inclusion of hyperons yields a remarkably low value of a neutron star maximum mass . on the other hand , predictions from different versions of relativistic mean",
    "field models are quite different from one another.@xcite    the alternative approach to the eos with strange baryons presented in the next section will suggest that present ny interactions are not yet sufficiently constrained to allow for definite conclusions concerning the occurrence of a hybrid phase .",
    "it is one purpose of this section to bring in the new aspect of dirac effects on the @xmath195 hyperon as well as the nucleon . by ",
    "dirac effects \" we mean that the single - baryon wavefunction is calculated self - consistently with the appropriate effective interaction .",
    "the origin and nature of these effects on the nucleonic equation of state was discussed previously , see sec .",
    "3.2.1 .    a previous calculation from the idaho group@xcite of the binding energy of a @xmath195 impurity in nuclear matter showed that dirac effects on the @xmath195 hyperon yield a moderate reduction of the binding energy .",
    "in that calculation , we used the most recent nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) potential reported in ref.@xcite ( thereafter referred to as ny05 ) , and observed that @xmath65-matrix predictions obtained with ny05 are significantly differerent from calculations using the previous ( energy independent ) version of the jlich ny potential@xcite . therefore",
    ", in this work we will use both potentials , for comparison . as usual , the bonn b potential @xcite is used throughout for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) part .",
    "previous calculations of the eos with hyperons have typically been conducted within a non - relativistic framework together with r - space local ny potentials .",
    "the dbhf calculation we describe here uses non - local relativistic momentum - space ( nn and ny ) potentials and a relativistic many - body method , and is therefore fundamentally different .",
    "next we give a brief review of the formalism .",
    "the single - nucleon and single-@xmath195 potentials are obtained as @xmath213 and @xmath214 i.e. , the @xmath207 interaction is neglected . in the equations above , the various terms , @xmath215 ,",

    "they are given by @xmath218 @xmath219 and @xmath220 where the channel isospin @xmath141 can be 0 or 1 for the nn case and is equal to 1/2 for the @xmath221 case , and @xmath222 ( @xmath223 ) are the spin and isospin of the nucleon or @xmath195 .",
    "notice that @xmath224 an approximation often used in mean - field approaches .",

    "( [ ny11 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ny12 ] ) , respectively , account for protons and neutrons in both spin states or @xmath195 s in both spin states .",
    "finally the average potential energy per baryon is obtained as @xmath227 from which , together with a similar expression for the kinetic energy , one obtains the average energy per baryon .    the n@xmath195 @xmath65-matrix is obtained from the bethe - goldstone equation @xmath228 where @xmath229 and @xmath230 are the starting energy and the energy of the intermediate ny state , respectively , and @xmath231 is an energy - independent ny potential .    for two particles with masses @xmath232 and @xmath233 and fermi momenta @xmath234 and @xmath235 , pauli blocking requires @xmath236 the above condition implies the restriction @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the angle between the total ( @xmath239 ) and the relative ( @xmath240 ) momenta of the two particles , and @xmath241 .",
    "angle - averaging is then applied in the usual way .    in the present calculation",
    "we consider a non - vanishing density of @xmath195 s but do not allow for the presence of real @xmath209 s in the medium ( although both @xmath195 and @xmath209 are included in the coupled - channel calculation of the ny @xmath65-matrix , see eq .",

    "essentially we are considering a scenario where a small fraction of nucleons is replaced with @xmath195 s , as could be accomplished by an experiment aimed at producing multi-@xmath195 hypernuclei .",
    "multistrange systems , such as those produced in heavy - ion collisions , may of course contain other hyperons on the outset .",
    "for small @xmath195 densities , though , as those we consider here , the cascade ( @xmath242 ) and the @xmath209 hyperon are expected to decay quickly through the strong processes @xmath243 and @xmath244 . under these conditions , a mixture of nucleons and @xmath195 s can be considered ",

    "( in fact , the strong reactions mentioned above would have to be pauli blocked in order to produce a metastable multistrange system @xcite . )",
    "we neglect the @xmath245 interaction , as very little is known about it . furthermore ,",
    "non - local momentum - space @xmath246 potentials , appropriate for our dbhf framework , are not available at this time . for these reasons , we keep the @xmath195 concentration relatively low .",
    "we have incorporated dbhf effects in the @xmath195 matter calculation , which amounts to involving the @xmath195 single - particle dirac wave function in the self - consistent calculation through the @xmath195 effective mass , @xmath247.@xcite however , a problem that needs to be addressed with the jlich ny potential in conjunction with dbhf calculations is the use of the pseudoscalar coupling for the interactions of pseudoscalar mesons ( pions and kaons ) with nucleons and hyperons . for the reasons described in sec .",
    "3.2.1 ( that is , the close relationship between dirac effects and  z - diagram \" contributions ) , this relativistic correction is known to become unreasonably large when applied to a vertex involving pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "on the other hand , the gradient ( pseudovector ) coupling ( also supported by chiral symmetry arguments ) largely suppresses antiparticle contributions . to resolve this problem",
    ", one can make use of the on - shell equivalence between the pseudoscalar and the pseudovector coupling , which amounts to relating the coupling constants as follows : @xmath248 where @xmath249 denotes the pseudoscalar coupling constant and @xmath250 the pseudovector one ; @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 are the masses of the pseudoscalar meson and the two baryons involved in the vertex , respectively . this procedure can be made plausible by writing down the appropriate one - boson - exchange amplitudes and observing that , redefining the coupling constants as above , we have ( see ref.@xcite for the two - nucleon case ) @xmath254 where the ellipsis stands for off - shell contributions .",
    "thus , the pseudoscalar coupling can be interpreted as pseudovector coupling where the off - shell terms are ignored .",
    "this is what we apply in our dbhf calculations .",
    "more concretely , from a given pseudoscalar potential , first we extract the corresponding @xmath250 from eq .",
    "( [ ny19 ] ) . in the medium",
    ", @xmath255 will contain the coupling constant @xmath256 .",
    "when the baryon masses are reduced through the effective mass prescription , the reduction of the masses appearing at the denominator of the momentum - dependent part of the potential will be  balanced \" be the equally reduced masses at the numerator of the coupling constant .",
    "this prescription prevents the obe diagram from growing to unreasonably large values when effective masses are employed .",
    "next , we will be showing results for both the ny05 potential @xcite and the previous version of the jlich ny potential , ny94 , specifically the model referred to as @xmath257 in ref.@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ ny1 ] we show the energy per particle as a function of density for different @xmath195 concentrations as obtained from dbhf calculations along with the ny94 potential . as more",
    "nucleons are replaced with @xmath195 s , generally less binding energy per particle is generated .",
    "this is due to the weaker nature of the @xmath221 interaction relative to the nn one .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath195 fermi momentum grows rather quickly with @xmath258 , since only two @xmath195 s can occupy each state , rather than four , which implies a fast rise of the hyperon kinetic energy .",
    "( although , for small hyperon densities , there is at first some reduction of the kinetic energy , due to the fact that @xmath195 s have larger mass and can occupy lower energy levels . )",
    "we notice that the saturation density remains essentially unchanged with increasing hyperon concentrations . as density grows , though , larger @xmath195 concentrations start to yield increased attraction .",
    "one must keep in mind that , especially at the higher densities , the nn interaction become less and less attractive due to medium effects , in particular repulsive dirac effects .",
    "thus , removing nucleons from the system can actually amount to increased binding .",
    "moving now to fig .",
    "[ ny2 ] , where the ny05 potential is adopted , we see a very different scenario .",
    "we recall that the ny05 model is considerably more attractive , yielding about 50 mev for the @xmath195 binding energy @xcite whereas a value close to 30 mev was found with ny94 @xcite . naturally , we expect these differences to reflect onto the respective eos predictions . here , increasing the hyperon population yields more binding , a trend opposite to the one seen in the previous figure . again , the final balance is the result of a combination of effects .",
    "the fact that the nn component is repulsive at the higher densities , together with the more attractive nature of the ny05 potential , determines here a net increase in attraction with decreasing _",
    "nucleon _ density .",
    "however , the additional binding becomes smaller and smaller with increasing hyperon concentration , indicating that , at sufficiently large @xmath195 densities , the net balance may turn repulsive .",
    "notice also that in fig .",
    "[ ny2 ] the minimum moves towards higher densities , signifying that baryon pairs favor a smaller interparticle distance .    to summarize",
    ", one must keep in mind that the energy / particle is the result of a delicate balance of both the kinetic energies and the potential energies of the two baryon species , being weighed by the respective densities .",
    "thus , although the nn interaction is generally more attractive than the n@xmath195 one , the net effect of replacing nucleons with @xmath195 s will depend sensitively on the nature of the ny interaction that s being put into the system , as well as the  stiffness \" of the original , nucleonic , eos .",
    "this is further confirmed in fig .",

    "the second observation confirms the conclusions of ref.@xcite concerning the large uncertainties originating from the bare ny potentials .",

    "the neutron star maximum mass we obtain with the dbhf eos and free hyperons is close to 1.2 @xmath174 . considering that inclusion of the ny interaction would increase the pressure at high density , this result is not inconsistent with those shown in table 6 . in summary",
    ", our analysis confirms a large softening of the @xmath16-stable eos as a consequence of including strange baryons , accompanied by a strong reduction of the maximum mass , a conclusion that appears to be nearly model independent . the softening is mostly caused by conversion of the kinetic energy of the existing particle species into masses of the newly produced particles .",
    "the resulting maximum mass reduction appears in contraddiction with present constraints , and thus leaves intriguing questions open concerning phase transitions and degrees of freedom appropriate for high - density stellar matter .",
    "-stable matter from the dbhf calculation with no hyperons ( black dash ) and with free hyperons ( solid red ) . ]",
    "-stable matter from various models : the black dashed and dotted lines ( essentially identical ) are the results of bhf calculations with the argonne v18 and the paris potentials , respectively , including tbf and hyperons interacting via the nijmegen soft - core ny potential ( see ref.@xmath212 ) .",
    "the red solid line is obtained with the dbhf calculation for the nucleonic eos and free hyperons . ]",
    "the eos of hadronic matter enters in a variety of systems , from atomic nuclei to the most compact form of matter found in the universe , namely the matter in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "eos - related properties can and should be calculated _ ab initio _ and consistently from the same basic nuclear forces .",
    "they include : the nuclear matter  optical potential \" , effective in - medium cross sections , nucleon mean free path in nuclear matter , neutron skins , and neutron star properties .",
    "we have reviewed recent calculations of the eos , over a large range of densities and isospin asymmetries , with a particular eye on the microscopic approach .",
    "the obvious advantage of the latter lies in the opportunity of interpreting the predictions in terms of the input nuclear forces and their behavior in the many - body environment . in turn",
    ", this facilitates the identification of potentially missing dynamics .",
    "we have discussed differences among microscopic models which do or do not include explicit tbf .",
    "it is quite clear that model dependence amongst predictions can be quite large . naturally , this is especially the case at those densities where constraints are the weakest .",
    "rich and diverse effort is presently going on to improve the available constraints on the eos or find new ones .",
    "these constraints are usually extracted through the analysis of selected heavy - ion collision observables . at the same time",
    ", partnership between nuclear physics and astrophysics is becoming increasingly important towards advancing our understanding of exotic matter .",
    "perhaps the best prospects to discriminate among families of eos , especially at high density , are in more accurate measurements of neutron stars radii and/or moments of inertia .",
    "other eos - related issues of contemporary interest which we have not reviewed here include temperature dependence and polarizability of nuclear / neutron matter .",
    "knowledge of the finite - temperature eos plays a crucial role in the final stages of a supernova evolution .",
    "microscopic models which can successfully describe the ground state of nuclear matter should be the starting point to move on to its excited states .    as a final note , the emergence of frib@xcite will mark a turning point in the progress of experimental nuclear physics , possibly unveiling unknown areas on the nuclear chart .",
    "it is thus imperative that such large - scale projects be constantly supported by theoretical calculations with predictive power .",
    "support from the u.s .",

    "<S> we review a variety of theoretical and experimental investigations aimed at improving our knowledge of the nuclear matter equation of state . of particular interest </S>",
    "<S> are nuclear matter extreme states in terms of density and/or isospin asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state of matter with unequal concentrations of protons and neutrons has numerous applications . </S>",
    "<S> these include heavy - ion collisions , the physics of rare , short - lived nuclei and , on a dramatically different scale , the physics of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the  common denominator \" among these ( seemingly ) very different systems is the symmetry energy , which plays a crucial role in both the formation of the neutron skin in neutron - rich nuclei and the radius of a neutron star ( a system 18 orders of magnitude larger and 55 orders of magnitudes heavier ) . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the density dependence of the symmetry energy are not yet sufficiently constrained . throughout this article , our emphasis will be on the importance of adopting a microscopic approach to the many - body problem , which we believe to be the one with true predictive power . </S>"
