    "so , here is another workshop on collider physics . specifically on a rather exotic collider option , @xmath2 collider .",
    "why are we doing this , after all ?",
    "the answer to this question is quite simple .",
    "we believe that the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is the most pressing question in particle physics . and",
    "it is going to be a challenging task to completely reveal all secrets of ewsb",
    ". it will take substantial experimental and theoretical efforts to understand it .",
    "for this aim , having as many possible channels as possible will probably be necessary .",
    "why multi - channel ?",
    "we heard about the complementarity of hadron and lepton machines so many times .",
    "maybe enough of it .",
    "and we are talking here about yet another possible collider option .",
    "why bother ?",
    "i would like to remind you of an example in the history of particle physics where it was crucial to attack the same problem from many different channels .",
    "it is the @xmath0 form of the charged - current weak interaction .",
    "the first hint for parity violation came from a purely hadronic process . in cosmic ray and",
    "beam - based studies of strange particles , there appeared two particles with opposite parities but with exactly the same mass and lifetime  the famous @xmath3-@xmath4 puzzle . and it took geniuses like t. d. lee and c. n. yang ( 1956 ) to make a bold step towards the resolution : the parity violation .",
    "they pointed out that even though there was a wealth of evidence that parity was a good symmetry of the electromagnetic and strong interactions , there was basically no experimental test whether the weak interaction preserves parity .",
    "if it does not , we can identify the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons which decay into states with opposite parities .",
    "the evidence for parity violation came from two different channels in 1957 : semi - leptonic and purely leptonic .",
    "the semi - leptonic channel is the experiment on @xmath5co @xmath6 decay ( c. s. wu _ et al _ ) .",
    "the correlation between directions of the applied magnetic field and the electron momentum established the violation of parity .",
    "the purely leptonic channel is the experiment by garwin , lederman and weinrich , using the sequence of decays @xmath7 .",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath8 decay showed the stopped muon was highly polarized .",
    "it is interesting that both papers were published in the same volume of _ phys .",
    "rev . _ * 105 * side by side .",
    "the violation of parity opened up a big confusion in the community .",
    "the fermi hamiltonian of the weak interaction had to be reexamined by allowing all possible 40 independent parameters of scalar , vector and tensor lorentz structures .",
    "it also appeared , before 1957 , that the scalar and tensor interactions are dominant .    in order to choose @xmath9 , @xmath10 over @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "different types of nuclei had to be used . in the study of the @xmath14 angular correlation ,",
    "different nuclei sit at different points on the so - called scott diagram , depending on the relative magnitude of fermi and gamov  teller transitions and recoil energy spectra .",
    "the data using @xmath15ne can be explained either by a combination of @xmath16 or of @xmath17 .",
    "however , the data using the @xmath18ar nucleus prefer @xmath9 .",
    "the data from @xmath19ne and @xmath20he prefer @xmath10 . only after putting all of them together",
    ", the choice of @xmath9 and @xmath10 comes out preferred over @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this analysis could not be done without the determination of the negative helicity of the neutrino , evidence for which came from the @xmath21 capture of @xmath22 by goldhaber , grodzins , and sunyar in 1958 , which reduced the number of parameters by a factor of two .",
    "however , none of these measurements was able to establish precisely the @xmath0 form , because the strong interaction renormalizes the axial - vector coupling even though the cvc hypothesis keeps the normalization of the @xmath9 part non - renormalized .    in the purely leptonic channel , muon decay",
    "was studied in detail . by fitting the energy spectrum and angular correlation with polarized muons ,",
    "the parameter space was restricted .",
    "the michel parameter @xmath23 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath24 chose the @xmath0 theory by 1960 . even at the present time",
    ", this analysis still offers the best evidence for the @xmath0 nature .",
    "the 20 parameters were reduced to just one .",
    "and throughout all this , the universality of the weak interaction between muon decay ( purely leptonic ) and @xmath6-decay ( semi - leptonic ) played its role as the backbone of the development .",
    "i am telling students in my particle physics course that the discovery of the @xmath0 nature led to a major paradigm shift in the way we understand the elementary particles .",
    "this is not much emphasized , but it is a fundamental change . since the days of pauli , the spin of the electron used to be an _",
    "additional _ degree of freedom attached to a non - relativistic electron .",
    "however , the @xmath0 nature forced us to go to a totally different idea .",
    "the distinction of the left - handed and right - handed helicity states is fundamental ; these are _ different _ particles ! and this fundamental distinction does not allow the electron to stop , because then the helicity would lose its meaning .",
    "the elementary particles are _ chiral_. and only because of the higgs boson condensate , the left - handed and right - handed states can convert to each other and the electron can peacefully `` sit '' at rest .",
    "i anticipate that the experimental study of the physics of ewsb will be as confusing and complex . in order to fully reveal all the secrets",
    ", we are likely to need as many channels as possible .",
    "this is why we would like to have an @xmath25 machine in addition to the already - approved lhc project . as an added bonus ,",
    "an @xmath25 machine will offer an @xmath2 option at minimum cost and give us a handle on yet another channel in the study .",
    "of course , at this point we do not know how having different channels will help us to understand the physics of ewsb , because we do not yet know what the physics is .",
    "but we can do a case study using the known proposed mechanisms of ewsb and associated new particles in order to study how an @xmath2 option would help us . in the next sections we will see the cases of supersymmetry ( weakly interacting ewsb ) and strongly interacting ewsb from this point of view .",
    "in a review on @xmath27 physics,@xcite michael peskin and i listed the three important characteristics of an @xmath25 collider : cleanness , `` holism , '' and democracy .",
    "the cleanness refers to the fact that the event rate at an @xmath25 machine is low and offers a desirable environment for detectors and physics .",
    "since the initial state is well - defined , including the polarization of at least the @xmath28 beam , we know what we are doing .",
    "and the background is calculable .",
    "the `` holism '' refers to the capability to capture the entire event .",
    "since the kinematics is well - defined , we can use the beam energy constraint to facilitate the reconstruction of the event .",
    "lastly , democracy means that all final states , both signal and background , have comparable cross sections ; hence , the experiment is suitable for studying many different types of particles and interactions simultaneously .    by switching to the @xmath2 option , we retain cleanness and `` holism '' , but we lose democracy .",
    "basically , almost all final states _ can not _ be produced , both the signals and the backgrounds .",
    "there is no annihilation between @xmath29 and @xmath29 , which makes the level of the background even lower .",
    "however , this opens up a new channel in the experiment .",
    "there are some signals which can be studied with this option  there may be some exotic and/or rare final states .",
    "i will give a few relevant examples later .",
    "as emphasized earlier , we do not know what specifically would be the best signal to study in this new channel .",
    "but it is likely that there are some signals arising from the complexity in the physics of ewsb .",
    "let us take the superpartner of the electron , the selectron , for the purpose of this discussion . at the lhc",
    ", the selectron can be studied in detail if it appears in the decay of the second neutralino , @xmath30 , with its possible decay into @xmath31 .",
    "it is not always possible to study the selectron , however , depending on the precise pattern of the superparticle spectrum .    at an @xmath25 machine , the study of the selectron is more - or - less trivial as long as it exists within kinematic reach .",
    "furthermore , the use of a polarized right - handed electron beam suppresses the @xmath32-pair background , and many details , such as the mass of the selectron , the neutralino in its decay product , and the electron - selectron - neutralino coupling can be studied .    at an @xmath2 collider",
    ", the selectron can be studied in even greater detail .",
    "one reason is that the destructive interference between @xmath33-channel @xmath34 , @xmath35 exchange and @xmath36-channel @xmath37 exchange in the @xmath25 annihilation is gone in @xmath2 collisions , because of the absence of the @xmath33-channel diagram .",
    "this results in larger cross sections ( see fig .  [ m1dependence ] ) .",
    "second , there is no @xmath32-pair background even with the left - handed electron beam .",
    "third , one can control the polarization of both of the beams , which can effectively turn on or off the final states of interest .",
    "the @xmath38 initial state produces only the @xmath39 final state .",
    "similarly , @xmath40 leads to @xmath41 and @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "the experimental verification of this simple selection rule would tell us that the scalar particles can carry chirality , which is the very reason why supersymmetry protects scalar masses against radiative corrections .",
    "and the threshold behavior of @xmath44 is @xmath45 , as opposed to the @xmath46 behavior in @xmath25 annihilation .",
    "this is suitable for an accurate determination of the selectron mass .",
    "the absence of the @xmath32-pair background and the increase in the cross section allows us to study rare processes better than in an @xmath47 collision .",
    "one interesting example will be discussed by jonathan feng later in this workshop .",
    "what he pointed out together with nima arkani - hamed , hsin - chia cheng , and lawrence hall , is that the selectron may have a small mixing with the smuon ; this mixing then results in a phenomenon similar to the neutrino oscillation .",
    "when , for instance , @xmath48 is produced from @xmath25 annihilation , the produced @xmath49 is in its `` interaction eigenstate '' , which may differ from its mass eigenstate . then the @xmath49 can oscillate to a mixture of @xmath49 and @xmath50 and",
    "can decay into muon as well .",
    "this results in a final state of @xmath51.@xcite a search for this phenomenon can be done quite well in the @xmath25 environment , but much more efficiently in @xmath2 collisions , as seen in fig .",
    "[ lfvfig2 ] , because of the absence of the @xmath32-pair background and of the higher cross section .",
    "another important example is the following precision measurement : by studying the selectron in detail , the @xmath49-@xmath52-@xmath37 coupling can be measured precisely in the @xmath53 process.@xcite again , thanks to the lower background and the higher cross section , this measurement can be done better with an @xmath2 option.@xcite since this coupling is supposed to be the same as the @xmath54 gauge coupling @xmath55 because of supersymmetry , this would be an important quantitative test if the interactions preserve supersymmetry .",
    "if a small violation were seen , it could be interpreted as the violation of supersymmetry due to the heaviness of squarks  which can modify the @xmath49-@xmath52-@xmath37 coupling at the one - loop level .",
    "the small violation could be used to determine roughly how massive the squarks are .",
    "this effect is called a super - oblique correction , in analogy to the determination of the top quark and higgs boson masses from electroweak precision measurements .",
    "the better accuracy achievable at an @xmath2 option could prove essential in this type of study .",
    "one may also look for some exotic physics with an @xmath2 option .",
    "for instance , the @xmath56-parity violating interactions @xmath57 do not generate @xmath58 or @xmath59-@xmath52 conversions because of the conserved @xmath60 quantum number .",
    "the best bound on these couplings come from muonium conversion , @xmath61 , and @xmath52-@xmath59-@xmath3 universality ; it is of the order of 0.1 for @xmath62  gev .",
    "these interactions can cause the reaction @xmath63 with essentially no background .",
    "the event rate is given roughly by @xmath64 one can see more than 5 events if @xmath65 , which is below the current limits .",
    "the strongly - interacting ewsb sector will pose a great challenge at next - generation collider experiments .",
    "the signal is a rather featureless enhancement in the interaction between @xmath32- and @xmath35-bosons at very high energies , @xmath66  tev .",
    "the tev - scale experiments in this case are regarded as the `` low - energy limit '' of the true dynamics of ewsb , which is analogous to pion scattering in the low - energy limit of the qcd , described by the chiral lagrangian .",
    "a better manifestation of the dynamics of ewsb may show clearer at yet higher energies , such as at a 4  tev muon collider . until we can reach such a high center - of - mass energy ,",
    "all we can do is to study the `` low - energy '' interaction of @xmath32-bosons in detail and speculate on the dynamics . for this purpose , it is necessary to determine the size of the interaction ( scattering lengths ) in all possible channels .",
    "table  [ barklow ] shows the relative merit of different channels for different scenarios .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one possibility which has not been studied is the @xmath67 channel . due to a magical cancelation",
    ", there is no strong interaction in this channel according to the low - energy theorem ( let ) .",
    "however , there is likely to be a strong interaction turning on at order @xmath68 and hence it uniquely picks up the model - dependent piece at the next - to - leading order in the derivative expansion .",
    "the feasibility of this study has to be examined .",
    "it is certain , however , that the @xmath2 option is best suited for this study , using right - handed electron beams @xmath69 , because of the absence of the @xmath70 fusion mechanism .",
    "i will not go into the other possible interests in the @xmath2 option as discussed in the literature , because they are covered by other speakers in this workshop .",
    "it includes the higgs production from @xmath71 fusion ( minkowski ) , @xmath36-channel @xmath72-exchange ( rizzo ) , doubly - charged higgs @xmath73 from @xmath74 fusion ( gunion ) , @xmath75 production from @xmath74 fusion ( haber ) , supersymmetry signatures ( peskin , thomas , feng , cheng ) , strong ewsb ( han ) , anomalous triple - gauge - boson vertices ( choudhury ) , dilepton resonance ( frampton ) , compositeness ( barklow ) , leptoquarks ( rizzo ) , @xmath76 from right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath36-channel exchange ( greub , minkowski , heusch ) , @xmath77 ( hewett ) , @xmath78 ( takahashi ) .",
    "many of the signatures employ the new channel available only in an @xmath2 collision .",
    "the physics of ewsb is likely to produce rather messy and confusing data . in order to sort these out",
    ", we would like to have as many channels as possible .",
    "this is the most convincing argument behind the complementarity between the lhc and an @xmath25 linear collider .",
    "a further extrapolation of this argument raises the interest in the @xmath2 option as a natural sibling to the @xmath25 machine .",
    "it offers new channels and hence new observables",
    ".    we do not know how exactly data from various channels will collude to reveal the secrets of the physics of ewsb , because we do not know the physics yet .",
    "but in many examples that we know , the @xmath2 option offers new , interesting , and valuable observables .",
