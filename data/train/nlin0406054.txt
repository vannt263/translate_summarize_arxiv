    "this breakdown of _",
    "classical_quantum correspondence occurs because beyond the mixing time , multiple classical paths connect a generic initial state to a generic final state , and interference effects become @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", in a series of papers , heller and coworkers showed that _ semiclassical _ calculations in chaotic systems , which include the effect of interference between distinct classical paths , can follow the quantum propagator at times well beyond the mixing time  @xcite .",
    "an estimate for the breakdown time scale of semiclassical  quantum correspondence was obtained by quantifying the effects of caustics for a stadium billiard  @xcite .    over the past decade",
    ", significant light has been shed on the issue of semiclassical accuracy and its breakdown in diverse chaotic and regular systems .",
    "for example , boasman has used a semiclassical approximation to the boundary integral method to obtain a semiclassical spectrum for two - dimensional chaotic billiards , observing an overall semiclassical spectral shift as compared with the exact quantum spectrum , in addition to small random fluctuations  @xcite . on the other hand , prosen and robnik",

    "have obtained more recent results consistent with this conclusion  @xcite .",
    "primack and smilansky were among the first to analyze semiclassical accuracy for three - dimensional chaotic systems , focusing on including corrections to the state - counting function beyond the leading weyl term  @xcite .",
    "main and collaborators have developed the powerful harmonic inversion technique for accurate and efficient semiclassical calculations of energies , resonances , and matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "this technique , as well as the earlier cycle - expansion method  @xcite were applied recently to the four - sphere scattering problem , demonstrating a high degree of accuracy at a greatly reduced computational cost compared with brute - force quantum calculations  @xcite .",
    "another promising recent approach , put forward by vergini and coworkers , involves the accurate construction of quantum eigenstates as linear superpositions of  scar functions \" associated with short unstable periodic orbits  @xcite .    in the time domain",
    ", statistical arguments concerning the propagation of semiclassical errors have shown that semiclassical error in chaotic systems accumulates incoherently , and thus the squared error typically grows only linearly with time , in contrast with quadratic growth for the regular case  @xcite .",
    "transforming to the the energy domain , this implies that semiclassical methods are generically more accurate for computing wave functions and eigenvalues for chaotic systems than for regular ones , in the @xmath7 ( or high energy ) limit . in particular , for @xmath8 ,",
    "analytical arguments and numerical tests show that eigenvalues can be semiclassically resolved with great accuracy for chaotic systems , for sufficiently small @xmath1 , while in the regular case even the order of eigenvalues can not be unambiguously determined semiclassically .",
    "this result has been related to the reduction of the quantization ambiguity in chaotic systems  @xcite and to the slower decay of fidelity in the presence of strong chaos ( as long as the perturbation has non - zero diagonal matrix elements in the basis of the unperturbed system )  @xcite .",

    "the problem becomes particularly acute when one attempts to compare semiclassical dynamics in hard chaotic systems with that in a regular system or in a mixed phase space .",
    "semiclassical calculations in a phase space basis are more natural from the point of view of classical  quantum correspondence and have the inherent advantage of allowing direct comparison between time evolution in chaotic , regular and mixed systems , without the result being overwhelmed by the problem of position - space or momentum - space caustics .    the aim of this paper is to improve our understanding of semiclassical accuracy in a phase space representation , as a function of time and @xmath1 , and to directly compare the behavior of the semiclassical error in chaotic , regular , and mixed systems .",

    "we briefly present the model and the method used for performing semiclassical and quantum calculations in phase space .",
    "theoretical expressions for semiclassical accuracy in chaotic systems are presented in section  [ chaodyn ] , along with supporting numerical data from the model system .",

    "@xcite concerning the linear growth with time of the mean squared semiclassical error , as well as the prediction of linear decrease with @xmath9 of the error at the heisenberg time .",
    "this is followed by a similar analysis for regular and mixed systems , in sections  [ regdyn ] and [ mixeddyn ] , respectively .",
    "we find that the behavior of the semiclassical error at the energy scale of a mean level spacing corresponds well to the effect of the quantization ambiguity on the spectrum , which was previously studied in ref .",
    "finally , section  [ summary ] summarizes the results and presents an outlook for the future .",
    "although our theoretical analysis applies quite generally to two - dimensional noninteracting systems , we simplify the numerical simulations by focusing on one - dimensional kicked maps , which share most scaling and other physical properties of this class of systems  @xcite .",
    "the discrete - time map can be regarded as a poincar surface of section of a two - dimensional system with hamiltonian dynamics . specifically , we parametrize the one - step map on a toroidal classical phase space @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 the dynamics is iterated to obtain classical evolution over many kicks ( or many bounces in the corresponding two - dimensional hamiltonian system ) . for values @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",

[ fig_mixed ]  ( a ) , for @xmath140",
    "we see that the semiclassical error is peaked in the major stable regions of phase space , particularly in the large stable island surrounding the @xmath141 stable fixed point , and to a somewhat lesser extent in the islands associated with the period-2 orbit at @xmath142 .",

    "the total semiclassical error for a mixed system is of course dominated by the error associated with the stable regions , and scales in the same way as the error for a regular system in section  [ regdyn ] .",
    "phase - space semiclassical propagation allows us to make direct comparison of semiclassical validity in chaotic and stable classical systems . using the same semiclassical approximation in both cases results in a semiclassical error that scales with @xmath9 in the same way at short times .",
    "however , the growth of the error with time is very different in the two situations . in the regular case , the error grows coherently because each trajectory repeatedly visits the same regions of space phase ; the mean squared error therefore grows quadratically with time . in the chaotic case , this coherence effect does not occur at times short compared with the heisenberg time , resulting in a linear growth of the mean squared error .    at the heisenberg time itself , the mean squared error in the propagator matrix elements becomes @xmath6 in the case of a classically stable dynamics , making it impossible in general to speak of well - defined semiclassical wave functions or eigenvalues , i.e. ones that are independent of the choice of semiclassical coordinates . for",
    "a given choice of coordinates , semiclassical quantization generically will produce eigenvalues differing by the order of a mean level spacing from their quantum counterparts .",
    "different semiclassical quantizations of a regular system will produce spectra differing from each other at the same order , making it impossible to uniquely determine even the order of eigenvalues in the spectrum via semiclassical methods ( unless a particularly favorable set of coordinates can be chosen where semiclassics happens to be exact , e.g. , for a separable dynamics ) .",
    "in contrast , semiclassical dynamics at the heisenberg time for a classically chaotic system becomes increasingly accurate as the system energy is increased . in the energy domain ,",
    "the semiclassical error becomes a progressively smaller fraction of a mean level spacing , so the spectrum can be semiclassically determined with arbitrarily high accuracy when very highly excited states are considered .",
    "the convergence of semiclassical to quantum behavior for chaotic system is expected to be independent of the particular semiclassical method chosen ( for example , it is independent of whether a position , momentum , or phase space semiclassics is used ) as long as the methods have the same scaling with @xmath9 at fixed time .",
    "all calculations in the present paper were performed for time - dependent one - dimensional maps , whose scaling properties are equivalent to those of two - dimensional hamiltonian systems . in @xmath145 dimensions , or in an interacting system , the heisenberg time grows as a higher power of @xmath49 than in the two - dimensional single - particle case , resulting in a larger accumulated semiclassical error by the heisenberg time for both chaotic and regular systems .",

    "e.g. , in the case of two interacting particles in two dimensions with no conserved quantities apart from total energy , the semiclassical approximation is expected to break down well before the heisenberg time , even when the dynamics is fully chaotic . it would be interesting to investigate this behavior quantitatively for model systems , and also to ascertain how a higher - order semiclassical approximation may enable semiclassical methods to remain valid for interacting systems .",
