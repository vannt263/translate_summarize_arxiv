    "surveys of carbon monoxide ( co ) emission lines are the primary means for gathering information about the distribution and kinematics of molecular material in the galaxy .",
    "the observer , when embarking on a co survey , must choose the survey parameters with an eye to the astrophysical problem to be attacked , because millimeter - wave telescopes have limitations in observing speed , sensitivity , and resolution .",
    "rapid improvements in technology have allowed ever larger and more finely - detailed surveys , but the current state of the art is not yet able to produce detailed , low - noise maps of every molecular cloud in the milky way .",
    "combes ( 1991 ) has reviewed sixteen co surveys and discussed the results .",
    "early surveys , such as schwartz et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , burton and gordon ( 1978 ) , and solomon et al . ( 1979 ) determined the large - scale distribution of co in the milky way .",
    "the columbia mini and southern mini surveys ( dame et al . 1987 , bronfman et al . 1988 ) , in particular , measured the co emissivity of the whole galaxy and determined its distribution on scales larger than @xmath13 pc .",
    "later surveys have concentrated on molecular cloud properties and the relationship between molecular clouds and galactic structure .",
    "the bell laboratories @xmath1co  survey presented here was designed to identify most of the molecular clouds in the first quadrant of the galaxy and provide some information about their size , shape , and velocity .",
    "it differs from previous surveys in the accuracy with which clouds can be identified and the molecular line emissivity parceled out among them .",
    "these data will be used to approach the problem of spiral structure and its effect on molecular clouds and star formation .    several statistical studies ( scoville et al .",
    "1987 ; solomon et al . 1987",
    "; sodroski 1991 ) of the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) identified in survey data have led to significant results on the kinematics of disk structure , locations and extent of spiral arms , and the mass and size spectra of the gmcs .",
    "these analyses were based on a simple methodology for recognizing molecular clouds in survey data . in these studies ,",
    "a molecular cloud is defined as a region in @xmath14 survey space where the @xmath15co  line emission exceeds a particular threshold brightness temperature .",
    "the tendency for @xmath15co  lines from different clouds to blend together because of spatial and velocity crowding and optical depth effects has led to the choice of a high value for that threshold .",
    "scientifically important inaccuracies in our quantitative understanding of the distribution of molecular gas may result , especially in crowded regions such as the molecular ring .",
    "small clouds may be missed entirely because even their central brightnesses may not exceed the threshold , while large clouds are sometimes spurious blends of objects at different distances .",
    "significant crowding of molecular material occurs throughout the first and fourth quadrants of the galaxy , especially on the locus of tangent points . along any line of sight toward the inner galaxy , the point on the line closest to the galactic center is the tangent point , and clouds near this point have the largest velocity and the most velocity crowding .",
    "clouds at the tangent point are , however , particularly interesting because they are at an inflection point in the velocity - distance relation and therefore have unambiguously determined distances .",
    "the @xmath15co  line becomes optically thick towards most molecular clouds .",
    "the isotopically - substituted @xmath1co  molecule is a more accurate tracer of molecular column density , because its optical depth is a factor of @xmath13 times smaller than that of @xmath15co .",
    "data obtained in the @xmath1co  ( 1 - 0 ) emission line with a large spatial coverage and a high resolution can be used to quantitatively study the molecular material near young stellar objects ( ysos ) , since the more optically thin emission traces dense regions where star formation takes place . while the @xmath1co  lines are several times weaker than @xmath15co , its smaller opacity , relatively high abundance ( [ @xmath1co]/[h@xmath16 @xmath17 in the solar neighborhood  frerking et al .",
    "1982 ) , and the relatively greater transparency of the atmosphere at 110 ghz make @xmath1co  the species of choice for surveying molecular gas in crowded regions .",
    "surveys conducted in @xmath1co  can be used to separate and catalog clouds better than @xmath15co  surveys .",
    "the primary disadvantage of @xmath1co  surveys is that they are less sensitive to weak co emission than are @xmath15co  surveys .",
    "weak @xmath15co  emission has been detected in small interstellar clouds ( e.g. magnani , blitz , and mundy 1985 ) and in a thick molecular layer associated with the whole galactic disk ( dame & thaddeus 1994 ) . such material has a @xmath1co  / @xmath15co   line intensity ratio which is smaller than that of most molecular material , and the @xmath1co  emission is therefore more likely to be buried in noise .",
    "the low noise level of the present survey partially compensates for this effect . in the region covered by the present survey ,",
    "almost all clouds seen in @xmath15co  surveys are also seen here .",
    "several @xmath1co  surveys were completed in the 1980s ( liszt et al .",
    "1984 ; jacq et al .",
    "1988 ; bronfman et al .",
    "these are , however , all one - dimensional  limited to the galactic mid - plane ( @xmath18 ) . aside from the bell laboratories @xmath1co  survey , systematic two - dimensional @xmath1co  surveys of the galactic plane have been conducted only toward limited regions : nagoya university s @xmath1co  map made with their 4 m telescope ( @xmath19 beamwidth ) with a spatial sampling of @xmath20 toward the cygnus region ( dobashi et al .",

    "3 the data are shown as longitude - velocity color maps , one at each latitude , and the principal characteristics of the survey data are discussed .",
    "the data were obtained with the 7 m off - axis cassegrain radio telescope located at bell laboratories , crawford hill in holmdel , new jersey ( chu et al .",
    "1978 ) between 1978 and 1992 .",
    "the beamwidth ( fwhm ) of the telescope is @xmath22 at the frequency of @xmath1co  @xmath0 line ( 110.20913 ghz ) .",
    "a schottky - diode receiver system developed by r. a. linke was used for the early data ; after 1982 , superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) mixer receivers developed by r.a . linke and a. a.",
    "stark were used .",
    "the superconducting junctions were fabricated by r. e. miller and a. a. stark at bell laboratories , murray hill .",
    "single - sideband ( ssb ) operation was achieved using a fabry - perot filter in reflection which had 11 to 15 db rejection of the image sideband .",
    "the unwanted image sideband transmitted through the fabry - perot filter was terminated in a millimeter - wave load with a 28 k radiation temperature .",
    "the receiver was located at a non - tilting nasmyth focus in a housing located on the azimuth structure .",
    "the receiver was calibrated by chopping between an ambient temperature load and a liquid nitrogen - cooled load located near the cassegrain focus .",
    "single sideband receiver temperature of the receiver systems ranged from 76 to 360 k during the years of observation , with typical values around 120 k. atmospheric sky brightness was measured several times each hour by chopping between the 77 k cassegrain cold load and the sky .",
    "the correction for atmospheric opacity was then calculated using a plane - parallel atmospheric model .",
    "typical ssb atmosphere - corrected system temperatures were @xmath23 600 k. observations were not made when @xmath24 exceeded 1000 k. the 7 m antenna has a main beam efficiency of 89% at 100 ghz ; another 5% of the detected power comes from the antenna sidelobes and about 6% comes from the ground pickup . the spectra were obtained with a 256 channel filterbank consisting of filters with a 250 khz spacing and a 512 channel filterbank consisting of filters with a 1 mhz spacing .",
    "the individual filters in these filterbanks have rectangular bandpasses with little overlap between adjacent filters .",
    "the frequency domain is therefore slightly undersampled .",
    "the range of the survey is ( @xmath2 ) = ( @xmath3 to @xmath25 to @xmath5 ) , comprising about 244 square degrees .",
    "table 1 lists the regions observed and the data sampling within those regions . in figure 1 , the grid spacing and beamsize of the bell laboratories @xmath1co  survey is compared with those of other surveys : the columbia @xmath15co  galactic plane survey and university of massachusetts - stony brook @xmath15co  first quadrant galactic plane survey ( umass - sb ) are shown in thin solid - line circles , and nagoya university @xmath1co  survey and bell laboratories @xmath1co  surveys are represented in thick solid - line circles on the @xmath6-grid .",
    "a total of 73,000 positions were observed .",
    "all observations are position - switched data .",
    "each spectrum is a weighted average of observations at its  on \" position and two  off \" positions .",
    "the galactic center data are described by bally et al .",
    "the data with @xmath26 were obtained with a multiple - map position switching technique .",
    "this means that during the data acquisition , observations of five  on \" positions were temporally interspersed with observations of two  off \" positions , and the spectra from all five  on \" positions use the exact same  off \" measurements .",
    "each of the two  off \" positions were observed for @xmath27 times longer than the individual  on \" positions in order to optimize the noise level and observing speed .",
    "the multiple - map technique increases the speed of the observations , but has the undesirable effect that the noise in the five resulting spectra is somewhat correlated : the  on \" data for each position ( including associated noise ) are unique , but the  off \" data ( including associated noise ) are the same for all five spectra .",
    "the five  on \" positions are separated by @xmath28 , so positions with correlated noise have three other grid points with totally different noise between them .",
    "the galactic coordinates of each set of five points are given by @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 in @xmath33 increments , @xmath34 varies from 0 to 4 during the course of a single multiple map position switch , and @xmath35 varies from @xmath36 to @xmath37 in @xmath38 increments during the course of a day s observations . @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath40 were fixed for each day s observations .",
    "the galactic coordinates of the reference positions are given by @xmath41 @xmath42 there are , therefore , only 216  off \" positions in the survey .",
    "these  off \" positions are not necessarily free of emission .",
    "the method by which the spectra were corrected for emission in the off or reference position is described in  2.4 .",
    "the typical on - source integration time was @xmath43 for each of the five  on \" positions and @xmath44 for each of the two  off \" positions , for a total position switch cycle of @xmath45 .",
    "this minute - long cycle was repeated 6 to 40 times ( depending on the opacity of the sky ) so that the root - mean - square noise in each spectrum , after calibration , is 0.1 k in 250 khz channels . in good weather , it was possible to complete a full set of observed points having particular values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( that is , all the points with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ranging over their full set of allowed values ) in one day .",
    "in poor weather the galactic plane would set before a full set of points could be obtained , and the undone points would be rescheduled for a later day .",
    "receiver calibration was accomplished by chopping between an ambient temperature load and a load filled with boiling liquid nitrogen .",
    "sky brightness measurements were accomplished by chopping between the liquid - nitrogen load and the sky .",
    "these measurements were made at roughly 20 minute intervals .",
    "all antenna temperatures quoted here are corrected for atmospheric extinction and for the forward spillover and scattering losses of the antenna ( @xmath46 = 0.91 ) , and are therefore on the @xmath11 brightness temperature scale as defined by kutner and ulich ( 1981 ) . in order to convert to a @xmath47 brightness temperature scale ,",
    "the data as presented here should be multiplied by @xmath48 .",
    "these data were obtained during hundreds of days of observing over the ten - year period .",
    "observations were made by a. a. stark , r. w. wilson , j. bally , m. pound , g. r. knapp , and w. d. langer .",

    "( 1987 , 1988 ) .",
    "advances in computation and the recent availability of powerful data reduction and display packages now permit the full data set to be re - reduced and presented here .",
    "the raw obs - format spectra were calibrated and a linear fit to the baseline was removed in the bell labs data reduction program comb .",
    "the resulting comb stacks were written out as 3-dimensional ( @xmath49 ) fits format data cubes which can be manipulated with the standard data reduction packages iraf and aips . for the region @xmath50 ,",
    "the comb stacks data were written onto a ( partially - filled ) @xmath6-grid in ( @xmath51 ) , and a 0.68  ( one filter - bank channel width ) grid in velocity .",
    "the size of the data cube outside the galactic center region is ( @xmath52)=(364,2241,41 ) pixels .",
    "unfilled positions on the @xmath6-grid were filled in by linear interpolation over the nearest four positions using iraf and saoimage .",
    "we used the fcrao task package and developed scripts within iraf to interpolate and reduce the data .",
    "a second - order baseline fit was subtracted from the spectra .",
    "bad channels caused by the malfunction of individual filters in the filterbank were identified in the fits image and fixed by interpolating adjacent good data over the bad pixels .",
    "as described above , the  off \" positions used for the position switch are not necessarily clean of emission .",
    "about 2% of the raw spectra were contaminated with negative features resulting from emission in the reference positions .",
    "essentially all of this emission is within the velocity range @xmath53 to 5  and almost certainly originates in dark clouds near the sun .",
    "the strongest of these features was less than 0.5 k. since each  off \" position was used for several hundred  on \" positions at the same value of @xmath35 , it is likely that at least one  on \" position is free of emission at the velocity at which the  off \" is contaminated .",
    "the  on \" position spectra sharing the same @xmath35 were therefore searched for the biggest negative feature .",
    "data in a small range of velocities around this biggest negative feature were extracted from that spectrum .",
    "these extracted data were then taken to represent the emission in the  off \" position , and it was subtracted from all of the  on \" positions sharing the same value of @xmath35 . about 0.03% of the pixels were modified by this method .",
    "a comparison with the umass - sb @xmath15co  database shows that these recovered pixels do not show a systematically different ratio of @xmath15co  to @xmath1co  .    after removing the effects of the contaminating emissions in the off positions ,",
    "the database was combined with the galactic center survey fits data cube ( bally et al .",
    "the galactic center data were interpolated into a @xmath6 grid and a @xmath54 grid .",
    "thus the final database including the galactic center region is ( @xmath52 ) = ( 501,2441,41 ) in pixel units and the velocity range is @xmath55 to @xmath56 , longitude is @xmath3 to @xmath37 , and latitude is @xmath57 to @xmath38 .",
    "a histogram of the number of _ l , b , _ and _ v _ pixels versus brightness temperature of the @xmath1co  data ( @xmath58 with 0.68  resolution ) except the galactic center region is shown in figure 2 in linear and logarithmic scales , and was obtained by binning the data into 0.02 k - wide bins .",
    "the brightness temperatures ( @xmath11 ) in the plot range from @xmath59 to 6 k. a few pixels in the survey are as hot as 17.4 k. only pixels from the observed ranges of position ( @xmath60 ) and velocity listed in table 1 are included in this histogram .",
    "we present the bell laboratories @xmath1co  survey in the form of longitude - velocity maps at latitudes separated by @xmath84 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the reduced fits cubes have been smoothed with a boxcar function to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the boxcar function was @xmath8 wide in longitude and @xmath85 wide in the velocity direction .",
    "the velocity range of the observations is visible in figure 4 as the width in velocity of the grey dots , which are at the noise level of the survey .",
    "the color scale of the maps represents increasing brightness temperature in the order : grey , blue , green , yellow , and red .",
    "the color maps were generated using the wip graphic package .",
    "like all galactic co surveys to date , the data in this survey are spatially undersampled , in the sense that the spacing between adjacent beams is more than the half beamwidth required by the nyquist sampling theorem . as shown in table 1 ,",
    "some of the galactic center region data are nearly fully sampled , with a @xmath86 grid and a @xmath22 beam ; in this region there is only slight aliasing of high spatial frequencies and no sampling error in the total flux . the majority of the data ,",
    "however , are sampled on a grid whose spacing is two beamwidths or more ; these data do not contain information about spatial wavelengths smaller than @xmath8 , and there can be substantial error in the total flux of small sections of the survey .",
    "the maps will not accurately reproduce small scale structures and may contain artificial structures because of the lack of information . in particular , a small cloud that happened to lie between grid points at the @xmath8 or @xmath6 spacings could be missed entirely .",
    "such a cloud might be as large as @xmath12 solar masses if it were 15 kpc distant .",
    "we have assumed in making the @xmath87@xmath88 diagrams that the most probable value at the unobserved points is an interpolation from the adjacent points . since the grid points are arbitrarily chosen to fall at regular intervals in galactic coordinates , they are a  fair sample \" , and it is unlikely that there is significant sampling error in the @xmath1co  flux of regions larger than a square degree .",
    "care must be taken when considering small sections of the survey , however , because of the spatial incompleteness : data at grid points actually observed retain all the original information as observed , but the interpolated points could be highly inaccurate .",
    "the velocity range of @xmath89 to 147  for the region @xmath90 is enough to encompass the whole velocity range of molecular gas emission , with the exception of one feature .",
    "this elongated feature at ( @xmath91 ) = ( @xmath92 ) in figure 4 extends beyond the positive velocity limit of this survey .",
    "the columbia survey shows this feature extending to 220  ( dame et al .",
    "1987 ) .      1 .",
    "it is found that only @xmath94 12% of the pixels in ( @xmath52 ) 3-d space are responsible for the @xmath1co  emission over the region surveyed .",
    "this number would be even smaller for a survey which was more extensive in @xmath95 , or which had larger velocity coverage .",
    "about 39% of the total survey emissivity arises in 3-d pixels having brightness temperature above @xmath96 k ( @xmath97 ) , which is to say : @xmath98 similarly , 16% of the survey emissivity arises in pixels above 2 k , and 3.4% arises in pixels above 4k .",
    "these values can be compared with the umass - sb @xmath15co  survey s 17.5% above 4 k ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "a comparison with the umass - sb survey shows that at any point in the survey , the @xmath1co  emission is related to the @xmath15co  emission .",
    "that relationship can be expressed as a monotonic function with scatter ( stark et al .",
    "even though the @xmath1co  is roughly predictable from the @xmath15co  emission in a statistical sense , features of the clouds are more clearly delineated in @xmath1co  than @xmath15co . in figure 5 ,",
    "an example of @xmath15co  and @xmath1co  longitude - velocity maps for the region @xmath100 at @xmath101 is shown .",
    "the @xmath15co  map was also taken using the bell labs 7 m telescope , but it differs only slightly from the umass - sb survey data . in the @xmath15co  map ,",
    "cloud boundaries are not clear , and clumps are not unambiguously delineated . in the @xmath1co  map , clouds are more readily distinguishable .",
    "the cloud identification using the @xmath1co  line is much easier than that using the @xmath15co  line since the @xmath1co  lines are more optically thin , so that the cloud boundaries can be determined at a lower threshold brightness temperature .",
    "3 .   using the modified cloud identification code within iraf ( lee et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath1co  clouds have been identified and cataloged as a function of threshold brightness temperature .",
    "there are 1250 molecular clouds identified with 1 k threshold ; 560 clouds with 2 k threshold , and 240 clouds with 3 k. clouds with the hottest cores ( t@xmath102(@xmath1co  ) @xmath103 3 k ) are restricted to the 6 kpc molecular ring ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 region .",
    "it is found that the peak brightness temperatures in the galactic center ( @xmath106 ) are not as high as those in the molecular ring ( see figure 4 , @xmath107 to @xmath108 ) .",
    "in addition to cloud identification , cloud core regions can also be located within the cloud complex . a sample spectrum centered on ( @xmath51 ) = ( @xmath109 )",
    "is presented in figure 6 . while there are saturated and self - absorbed features in @xmath15co  emission ( thin solid line ) , the @xmath1co  lines show clean , nearly gaussian , profiles . at the location ( @xmath51 )",
