    "beyond the optical edge of disc galaxies large amounts of dark matter are needed to explain the flat rotation curves determined from the velocity field of the gas ( bosma @xcite ; begeman @xcite ) .",
    "however , the contribution of the luminous disc matter to the total rotation can not be determined from a rotation curve analysis ( van albada et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , knowing the surface density of the disc allows the construction of the rotation curve of the disc only .",
    "comparison with the observed total rotation then gives the rotational contribution of the disc .",
    "galactic discs can essentially be described as locally isothermal stellar sheets embedded in a dark halo .",
    "measuring the stellar velocity dispersion of the disc then provides the surface density to determine this rotational contribution .    for a dozen galactic discs",
    "these velocity dispersion measurements have been done ( bottema @xcite , and references therein ) though for most of these only over a limited radial extent .",
    "the general conclusion is that a galactic disc provides , at the position of the maximum rotation of the disc , 63% @xmath6 10% of the total rotation of a galaxy ( bottema @xcite , hereafter b93 ) . using an analysis of the light and colour distributions of galactic discs this conclusion",
    "can be rewritten to @xmath7 when @xmath8 . for a disc with a certain brightness and colour a general expression",
    "is determined for its rotational contribution and for its mass - to - light ratio ( bottema @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately the error on the mass - to - light ratio is still large caused by the small sample of discs for which dispersions have actually been measured . consequently an extension of the sample is badly needed .",
    "there are other problems which can be addressed when disc dispersions are better known , for instance galaxy formation .",
    "nowadays it is believed that a collapse of dark matter creates the potential well in which baryons collect to form a galaxy ( e.g. katz & gunn @xcite ) . to check if this scenario is right and to understand the details , it is necessary to know the dark to luminous mass ratio in present day galaxies ( dalcanton et al .",
    "@xcite ; mo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition a theoretical basis",
    "can then be provided for the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher @xcite ; rhee @xcitea , @xciteb ) .    already in @xcite ostriker &",
    "peebles showed that a cold isolated disc is highly unstable to bar formation .",
    "more stable discs can be made by putting them in a large amount of spherical ( dark ) matter or when discs are hot .",
    "the observations of the stellar velocity dispersions show that the latter is not valid .",
    "consequently dark matter is needed to stabilize discs , but how much ? numerical calculations are well suited to investigate this problem .",
    "simulations by efstathiou et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , bottema & gerritsen ( @xcite ) , and syer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that the mass contribution of a stable disc must be well below the so called maximum disc hypothesis ( van albada & sancisi @xcite ) situation .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the results of the stellar dispersion measurements . on the other hand , stabilization of discs",
    "may be taken over by a massive central bulge .",
    "can a bulge maybe be considered as a luminous extension of a dark halo ?",
    "galactic bulges have a global isothermal nature in the sense that the observed velocity dispersion is rather uniform over the bulge s extent .",
    "bulges can be described consistently with models of isotropic oblate spheroids ( kormendy & illingworth @xcite ; jarvis & freeman @xcite ) , or in other words as rotationally flattened isothermal spheres .",
    "galaxies with morphological type ranging from sa to sb are equipped with both , a disc and a bulge , and consequently there is a region where these will overlap .",
    "one may expect that the different kinematical properties of bulge and disc , as observed where one or the other is dominant , are maintained when both are present .",
    "this was suggested by absorption line observations of the sb galaxy ngc 2613 ( bottema @xcite ) .",
    "this galaxy has a bulge which appears to be somewhat displaced from the centre and on one side clear double peaked line profiles are observed reminiscent of bulge and disc having a different rotation .",
    "such a scenario has also been suggested by kuijken & merrifield ( @xcite , hereafter km93 ) to explain the asymmetric absorption line profiles of the galaxy ugc 12591 .",
    "an asymmetric profile can be made as a superposition of a low dispersion rapidly rotating disc and a higher dispersion more slowly rotating bulge ; km93 show in a quantitative way that this can explain the ugc 12591 observations . to investigate the stellar kinematics in the bulge - disc transition region i obtained absorption line spectra of the sb spiral ngc 7331 .",
    "the data were lying of the shelve for a while when the discovery of a counterrotating bulge of ngc 7331 was announced ( prada et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter p96 ) .",
    "this renewed my interest in this galaxy and motivated the examination of the data .    since the first detection of a counterrotating component in an elliptical galaxy ( franx & illingworth @xcite ) a frantic search for more counterrotating galaxies started in the astronomical community .",
    "it appeared that counterrotation in elliptical galaxies is not uncommon which , in fact , is not unexpected considering the likely merger history of ellipticals . in later type galaxies , however , counterrotation is rare ; known to date are ngc 4550 , of type e7/s0 ( rix et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ngc 4826 of type sab ( braun et al . @xcite ; rix et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ngc 4138 of type sa ( jore et al .",
    "@xcite ) . also claimed to possess a counterrotating component is the sb galaxy ngc 7217 ( kuijken @xcite ; merrifield & kuijken @xcite ) although inspection of the line profiles shows that a kinematic asymmetry by a bulge / disc situation is more likely ( see also the discussion in the remainder of this paper ) .",
    "p96 find a counterrotating component in the sb galaxy ngc 7331 , at the 15% intensity level , counterrotating with 50 and this component is dynamically cold .",
    "that poses a problem ; how can two cold components exist together , one rotating with @xmath9 250 ( the disc ) and the other with 50 , in the same potential ? a more detailed analysis is certainly warranted .",
    "in addition to the kinematics in the transition region also the velocity dispersions of the disc and the bulge can be determined . from this",
    "the mass - to - light ratios of the components can be calculated and be compared with each other .",
    "ngc 7331 is a massive sb spiral galaxy .",

    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out on september 19 and 20 , 1987 , at the observatorio de roque de los muchachos on the island of la palma , using the isaac newton ( 2.5 m ) telescope .",
    "the intermediate dispersion spectrograph was used at the cassegrain focus .",
    "this spectrograph had a grating of 1200 groves per mm , a camera with a focal length of 235 mm ( wynne @xcite ) and slit width of 220 @xmath20 m (= 1 on the sky ) . in that way a spectrum is produced with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) velocity resolution of @xmath9 70 , centred at a wavelength of 5162  .",
    "the data were recorded with the image photon counting system ( ipcs ) , having a wavelength range from 4634 to 5691  , divided up into 2040 pixels .",
    "the spatial extent on the sky was covered by 82 consecutive spectral rows each of size 2 , resulting in a total extent of nearly four arcminutes . during the observations the seeing was considerably smaller than the size of a spectral row , leaving them all uncorrelated . on both nights",
    "the slit was put parallel to the major axis , at a position angle of 352 with the nucleus falling in the slit .",
    "one night the northern part of the galaxy was covered with the nucleus at row 13 , lying 38 arcseconds from the edge of the slit .",
    "although in this case also a part of the south side is covered , in the remainder of this paper the results from this observation will all be referred to as `` north side '' . on the second night",
    "the southern part was covered with the nucleus being positioned 2 beyond the end of the slit .",
    "results from this observation will be referred to as `` south side '' .    the total exposure on the north side lasted for 21000 seconds (=  5  @xmath10  50  @xmath11 ) and on the south side for 24000 seconds (=  6  @xmath10  40  @xmath11 ) .",
    "these exposures were divided up into single exposures of 1500 seconds , preceded and succeeded by the observation of a cu - ne calibration lamp .",
    "in addition spectra of 7 template stars all of type close to k0iii were recorded , of course using exactly the same instrumental configuration and wavelength calibration .",
    "furthermore observations of the twilight sky and dark current were made .",
    "for all the individual 2-d spectral images of the galaxy , the encompassing cu - ne lamp exposures were added .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed by using 22 emission lines spaced over the 1057 interval .",
    "the standard deviation of the lines from the final wavelength solution was never larger than four to five km per second .",
    "next the data were regridded to a common log @xmath21 scale ( 30.2 per pixel ) and added to form two , north side and south side , calibrated spectral images . for",
    "the template star exposures the same procedure was followed .",
    "the calibrated stellar spectra were shifted to one common redshift and after this , all spectra were averaged to produce one essentially noise free template spectrum .",
    "the flatfield exposures registered on the twilight sky showed that the pixel - to - pixel variation was less than 2% , being so small that no corrections were necessary .",
    "the twilight exposures were averaged together and along the wavelength direction , providing the response along the slit .",
    "the dark current subtracted images were corrected for this response .",
    "there was no detectable s - shape distortion and consequently no corrections to remove such a distortion were necessary . to get an impression of the count levels of the two galaxy spectra , in fig .",
    "2 the average number of counts over the wavelength range is shown along the slit .    the h@xmath22 and [ o  iii ] 5007   and 4959   lines were clearly visible in the spectra .",
    "the forbidden oxygen lines continued all the way to the centre of the galaxy , while h@xmath22 emission was essentially lost in the h@xmath22 absorption for radii less than @xmath9 20 arcseconds .",
    "the emission line kinematics was determined by fitting gaussians to the profiles . when necessary spectra were averaged along the slit to increase the s / n . also for the absorption lines spectra had to be averaged along the slit to obtain a sufficient s / n .",
    "each spectrum has a certain position along the slit corresponding to a fixed position on the galaxy or sky . at every position of every spectrum , encompassing spectra",
    "were added until a count level of galaxy emission of at least 200 was reached . in this way , for larger distances from the centre spectra become correlated but remain evenly distributed with separation of 2 .",
    "furthermore the s / n decreases at larger radii because of the constant level of sky and dark current emission .",
    "when averaged in this way , the resulting spectrum is weighted according to the intensity level of the individual spectra ; the position along the slit is ( except in fig .",
    "4 ) then also given as the intensity weighted position .",
    "next the continuum level was determined by fitting a fifth order polynomial to the whole spectrum and was subsequently subtracted . in this way",
    "one loses the line strength information but the spectrum will not suffer from division by a number close to zero . at positions of the emission lines and strong skylines ,",
    "spectra were put at a zero level such that those positions will not contribute to the cross - correlation sum .",
    "certainly on the north side and to a lesser extent on the south side there is not a sufficient slit section free of galaxy light .",
    "hence it is not possible to obtain a clean sky spectrum and consequently the sky was not subtracted . for the present case",
    "this does not pose a large problem . at first",
    "because all the radial velocities of ngc 7331 are substantially redwards from the solar radial velocity , and no blending of the line profiles of galaxy and the sun ( = sky ) can take place .",
    "secondly the amount of light from the galaxy is still large enough compared to that of the sky , that a continuum level sufficiently appropriate for the galaxy light can be determined . as for the galaxy , from the template spectrum",
    "the continuum level was subtracted .",
    "the cross correlation functions have been calculated between the spectral rows of the galaxy and the template spectrum .",
    "this is done by using fourier techniques . in general the continuum subtraction by means of the polynomial fit",
    "is not sufficient and additional low frequency wavenumbers have to be , and in the present case were , filtered out .",
    "insufficient filtering shows up immediately as a continuum level offset between the cross correlation function and the auto correlation function of the template .",
    "care has been taken that such an offset did not appear . except for the h@xmath22 absorption line and small regions where [ o  iii ] and skylines were present ,",
    "the whole spectral range was included in the cross correlation sum .",
    "this range contains a forest of hundreds of absorption lines of which the most striking are the mg triplet around 5170   and the fe / ca complex around 5250  .",
    "until this point the data handling is rather standard , but for getting out the actual stellar kinematics a number of different methods have been and are being used .",
    "all assume that the observed galaxy spectrum can be represented by that of a suitable template spectrum convolved with the galaxy broadening function , also called galaxy line profile . thus to obtain this line profile always",
    "some kind of deconvolution is involved .",
    "the first methods to be used are those by illingworth & freeman ( @xcite ) and by sargent et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , applying a division in fourier space , and the one by tonry & davis ( @xcite ) , applying a cross - correlation technique . later on other and improved methods have been used ( a.o .",
    "bender @xcite ; rix & white @xcite ; franx & illingworth @xcite ; van der marel & franx @xcite ; km93 ; statler @xcite ) establishing a situation where every author(s ) uses his own method .",
    "in general all such methods are being applied to elliptical galaxies or bulges , where one has a nearly constant velocity dispersion and a large surface brightness . for galactic discs , however , the surface brightness is lower and the velocity dispersion decreases towards larger radii . in such situations bottema ( @xcite )",
    "has used a method which remains as closely as possible to the original data .",
    "one can show that the cross - correlation function ( hereafter : ccf ) of template and galaxy spectra is equal to the convolution of the galactic line profile with the auto - correlation function ( hereafter : acf ) of the template spectrum ( bottema et al .",
    "displaying the ccf then gives one directly the line profile , albeit convolved with a symmetric acf . by fitting",
    "a grid of acfs broadened to different dispersions bottema ( @xcite ) extracted the relevant radial velocities and velocity dispersions .",
    "this method is straightforward and the fitting can be inspected graphically , but the error analysis had to be done by eye and asymmetric line profiles could not be accommodated for .",
    "therefore this method has been improved . in order to extract the line profile ,",
    "the ccf is deconvolved using the clean technique ( hgbom @xcite ) , with the template acf as beam or point spread function ( see also franx & illingworth @xcite )",
    ". certainly for barely resolved signals with substantial amounts of noise added such a cleaning technique proves to be a superior deconvolution method .",
    "hence it can be applied with confidence for the narrow , noisy , line profiles typical for galactic discs .",
    "clean components have been subtracted for a region around the peak of the ccf until a residual well below the noise level .",
    "the line profile was then restored by convolving the components to a gaussian function with a dispersion of @xmath23 velocity pixels and by adding the residuals .",
    "the width of this gaussian was determined as a compromise between more resolution and more noise for a narrower gaussian and less resolution with less noise for a broader function . in theory , if there is no noise , one could make the restoring function as narrow as allowed by the sampling criterion ; down to a dispersion of approximately one pixel .",
    "when a deconvolved line profile is obtained it can in principle be parameterized in any way .",
    "presently is was chosen to fit in first instance a gaussian to the profile , even if it is not symmetric . the radial velocity is given by the position and the stellar velocity dispersion by the gaussian dispersion from which the ( restored ) resolution has been subtracted quadratically .",
    "errors of the parameters are obtained from the usual least squares fitting procedure . by fitting such a single gaussian to the profile",
    "the position and dispersion are extracted in a way similar to that of the conventional methods , allowing and easy comparison and understanding . in the case of ngc",
    "7331 skewed profiles are observed and consequently more parameters are needed to describe the profile .",
    "well suited appeared to be the hermite polynomial analysis by van der marel & franx ( @xcite ) .",
    "only one additional asymmetric ( @xmath24 ) parameter was considered , resulting in a least squares fitting of the function    @xmath25 \\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to the line profile . here",
    "@xmath26 is the radial velocity and @xmath27 and @xmath24 the parameters to be determined .",
    "there are two matters to be noted . at first , the values of @xmath28 and @xmath19 are not completely , but nearly equal to the parameters obtained from a straight fit of a gaussian to the profile ( see van der marel & franx for a discussion ) . in practice , to the line profile both , a gaussian and the function given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) is fitted .",
    "but when results are presented @xmath28 and @xmath19 are not given , only the gaussian fit parameters . secondly , @xmath24 does not give the skewness of the actual line profile , but the skewness of the resolution broadened profile .",
    "when analysing the observations this should be taken into account .",
    "the radial velocities determined from the h@xmath22 and [ o  iii ] 5007  line are presented in fig .",
    "3 , together with the radial velocities inferred from the rotation curve ( begeman @xcite ; begeman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as can be seen , the velocities of the three emission lines are in excellent agreement . in the central region , for @xmath0 @xmath1 40  there is no gas and consequently no rotation curve .",
    "h@xmath22 is observed somewhat further inwards until approximately 30 . on the other hand the oxygen line (",
    "although weak ) continues all the way to the centre . in general bulges do not show any significant emission lines . for ngc 7331",
    "this indicates that the disc , or some other young galactic component is present in the centre , embedded in the bulge . to check whether the oxygen emission indeed originates from a cold component and not , for instance , from bulge planetary nebulae , the [ o  iii ]",
    "velocity dispersion was measured . only at the very centre , for radii less than five arcseconds this line",
    "is broadened to 100 @xmath6 20 . outside this radius",
    "the line is unresolved meaning a dispersion of less than @xmath9 30 .",
    "a comparison was made with the radial velocities along the major axis of the h@xmath29 and [ n  ii ] line as measured by afanasiev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "their data are confined to within 60 arcseconds from the centre , but have a much better spatial sampling than for the present observation .",
    "except for the usual absolute calibration error the velocities are in exact agreement , for instance the velocity feature at -18  is present in both observations . a comparison with the observations of rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) also shows agreement , although a detailed comparison is not possible because slit positions do not coincide completely .      to illustrate the appearance and quality of the absorption line kinematics",
    "all the cleaned line profiles along the major axis are presented in fig .",
    "this image is constructed using the averaging procedure along the slit as discussed in the previous section . therefore the indicated distances from maximum intensity of the individual line profiles are the distances of the spectra around which regions have been averaged , in an intensity weighted way .",
    "so these distances may differ slightly from the actual distance to the centre .",
    "north and south side have been combined on integer spectra while in reality there is a 0.2 spectral size ( of 2 ) shift .",
    "but these small approximations will not generate any significant deviation from the actual appearance of the position velocity diagram .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the template exhibits some corrugation along the velocity direction .",
    "most of this corrugation has been cleaned away but some residual remains as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 . in fact",
    ", this is to be expected because the template spectrum can never be a perfect match to the spectrum of the stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "any absorption line interpretation procedure suffers from this shortcoming , but this can only be seen by displaying matters as in fig .",
    "4 . looking at the figure one can thus notice a small gully at the high and low end of the galaxy s radial velocities .",
    "also some vague reflection patterns are apparent .",
    "the magnitude of these irregularities is small , however , always below the noise level determined from line free regions surrounding the galactic emission .",
    "in addition one may note the signal of the solar spectrum at a radial velocity of zero .    by fitting a gaussian to the line",
    "profiles the stellar radial velocities and dispersions are determined .",
    "the first are presented in fig . 5 , together with the radial velocities and emission line velocities , the latter given by a hand drawn line through the data points of fig .",
    "the velocity dispersions are presented in fig . 6 , top panel .",
    "at the centre dispersion values around 130 are reached , while for larger radii the dispersion decreases , similar for both sides of the galaxy . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 the @xmath24 parameter is displayed following from a fit of eq .",
    "( 1 ) to the profiles . like the dispersion this asymmetry parameter is symmetric and regular with respect to the centre of the galaxy .      from fig",
    ". 5 it will be immediately obvious that for radii @xmath1 40  the emission line gas appears to rotate slower than the stars .",
    "this is puzzling .",
    "one would expect the contrary ; caused by asymmetric drift and integration effects a regular galaxy shows , in general , a stellar rotation lower than that of the gas . that is to say , the stars rotate slower than the `` potential '' rotation or testparticle rotation (= rotation of a testparticle in the plane : @xmath30 ) . for",
    "a galaxy the emission line gas should rotate as testparticles and consequently for ngc 7331 the velocity aberration of this emission line gas is even larger than the observed velocity difference between stars and gas .",
    "for example at a radius of ten arcseconds the gas rotates more then 107 too slow , which amounts to nearly a factor of two .",
    "how can this be explained ?",
    "one might imagine a barred situation .",
    "it is known that stars ( miller & smith @xcite ; hohl & zang @xcite ) and gas ( athanassoula @xcite , and references therein ) have substantial non circular streaming motions along the bar .",
    "but at first it is hard to imagine how the gas motion might differ so substantially from the stellar motion . for instance",
    "the analysis by athannasoula ( 1992 ) shows that the gas motion in a bar largely follows the @xmath31 and @xmath32 stellar orbits .",
    "secondly the i and k band photometry of the central regions by p96 does not indicate any significant barred morphology .",
    "hence the explanation by a bar is unlikely .",
    "another possibility is that the gas ends , going inwards , in an edge - on gas ring at @xmath33 50",
    ". such a situation will give the kinematical appearance of a solid body rotator as observed inside this radius .",
    "however , given the need for a sudden inclination change from 75 to 90 degrees combined with the need for the gas to end at the same position , this explanation seems remote .    a slower apparent ( gas )",
    "rotation can , of course , be produced by a more face - on orientation of the plane in which the gas is rotating .",
    "to produce the difference between gas and stellar velocities as observed , it is then necessary that from approximately 40  inwards the gas plane is increasingly more inclined with respect to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "such an inner warped structure could have been generated by a gascloud or gas rich dwarf galaxy which has fallen in on an orbit with some angle with respect to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "numerical calculations show that certainly the gas will then quickly settle into the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this explanation is a theory which works in principle .",
    "however , to prove or disprove it will not be straightforward ; observations of the emission line gas other than along the major axis are needed . a different observation which supports",
    "the hypothesis of a warped gas layer is that of the inclined gas ring or disc inside the bulge of m31 ( boulesteix et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a galaxy similar in appearance as ngc 7331 .",
    "another point to be noted is the irregular behaviour along the slit of both the stellar radial velocities and dispersions .",
    "for example the stellar rotation is different on both sides near a radius of 100 .",
    "also at those positions the difference between gas and stellar rotation is different for both sides and in addition the velocity dispersion suddenly increases over there .",
    "this can only mean that in some regions of this galaxy stars and gas have not yet formed a relaxed configuration .",
    "is this kinematical appearance of ngc 7331 unusual ?",
    "no , it is not .",
    "the stellar kinematics of large galaxies is in general more irregular than that of smaller galaxies .",
    "these matters are discussed by bottema ( @xcite ) arguing that the irregularity could be the result of more or less recent capture of small matter clumps by large galaxies .",
    "both , the image of the line profiles in fig . 4 , and the @xmath24 parameter in fig .",
    "6 show that for radii less than 40  the line profiles are asymmetric ; they have a regular and shallow extension towards the systemic velocity . using a modified version of the unresolved gaussian decomposition method ( km93 )",
    "p96 find for the same object a double line profile interpreted by them as a counterrotating bulge .",
    "this double profile is found between radii of 5 to 20 arcseconds on both sides along the major axis .",
    "there is one dominant component at the normal galactic radial velocities .",
    "another component at a 15% intensity level of the dominant peak is counterrotating with approximately 60 and is unresolved by their spectrographic setup , meaning a velocity dispersion less than @xmath9 50 .",
    "compared to the bulge dispersion of 125 this component is cold .",
    "a close inspection of p96 s profiles shows that although the counterrotating component is barely above the @xmath34 noise level , it is present in a number of independent spectral rows .",
    "in this study such a counterrotating component is not observed .",
    "then we have the uncomfortable situation that different analyses of the same object give different results .",
    "how is that possible ? to check if some kind of error has been made using the present method of interpreting the data a close inspection was made of the original ccfns .",
    "the same asymmetry at radii @xmath35 40is obvious but there is no extra component .",
    "hence the clean procedure did not make appear or disappear any features . because the cross - correlation procedure gives you directly the line profiles it is not likely that such a counterrotating component really exists .",
    "note that p96 have nearly the same instrumental resolution , but spectra are taken around 8500   instead of the present 5100  .",
    "could p96 have done something wrong ? to investigate this",
    "the ugd algorithm has been applied to the present north side spectra .",
    "the same ugd setup with a two pixel dispersion and three pixel separation of the gaussians is used as by p96 , and with nearly equal velocity pixel sizes both analyses should be comparable . and",
    "the result ?",
    "also a counterrotating separate line profile is found at the 20% level of the main profile between radii of 10 and 40 counterrotating with 50 .",
    "the analysis of p96 differs slightly from the standard ugd algorithm .",
    "they use a two dimensional version of ugd where just as in the dispersion direction , also in the spatial direction gaussian components are fitted with a dispersion of 2 pixels and separation of 3 pixels .",
    "this imposes extra smoothness and noise suppression ( binney & merrifield @xcite ) .",
    "but , frankly , i do not see that such a procedure is much different from a simple smoothing along the spatial direction , giving better s / n and poorer resolution .",
    "p96 point out that : `` in general , the results of both algorithms ( ugd and 2dugd ) are the same '' .",
    "as demonstrated above , the original ugd algorithm indeed gives the same result as found by p96 and consequently in the present discussion it should not matter whether the 1dugd or 2dugd procedure is used .    anyway , the ugd method generates a counterrotating component while the cross - correlation clean ( ccc ) method only produces an asymmetric profile .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the two methods has been performed , doing some test analyses on skewed profiles .",
    "a description of this investigation is given in the appendix .",
    "it appears that the counterrotating component is most likely an aliasing feature produced by ugd .",
    "when errors are superposed on the lineprofile as calculated by ugd , this feature is not significant and should have been discarded .",
    "so , ugd is not wrong , but by omitting the presentation of the errors p96 may have been led to a wrong interpretation of the results .",
    "to interpret the observations a dynamical model of ngc 7331 will be constructed . for this",
    "a description is necessary of the luminosity distribution of the bulge and the disc which have to be derived from the photometry . in the present case",
    "such a procedure is not straightforward .",
    "photometry in the thuan & gunn ( @xcite ) r - band is obtained by kent ( @xcite ) . unfortunately a bulge / disc light decomposition according to kent",
    "s procedure is not possible because the apparent ellipticity of the bulge and disc are equal .",
    "therefore one has to resort to the classical method of assuming a certain density behaviour of one of the components , fit this behaviour there where this component is dominant and subtract to get the density of the other component .",
    "for example kent ( @xcite ) assumes an exponential bulge with scalelength of approximately 0.8 kpc , which he subtracts from the total photometry to get the disc light . in the rotation curve analysis by begeman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , for the same photometry a disc with scalelength of 62  has been fitted to the outer regions .",
    "subtraction of the disc gives the bulge light and a bulge to disc light ratio of @xmath9 1.4 , which is too large for this galaxy .",
    "photometry of the inner regions in the i and k bands is presented by p96 .",
    "although p96 argue for a different radial behaviour in k and i , in reality , overlaying the two profiles shows that both are nearly identical over the radial extent where both have been measured . in the remainder of this paper",
    "the i band photometry of p96 will be used .",
    "the r - band observations show a constant ellipticity @xmath36 of 0.6 for the whole galaxy . in the i and k band , however , the central regions show a tendency towards a rounder situation . fig . 2 of p96 gives the ellipticity along the major axis . for radii larger than 15  @xmath37",
    "consistent with kent s photometry ; going inwards , the ellipticity decreases gradually to @xmath38 at 5  and to @xmath39 near the centre .",
    "apparently there is a nearly spherical distribution very close to the centre .",

    "these ratios or situations will be referred to as `` large '' bulge and `` small '' bulge .",
    "the large bulge was constructed in the following way : stellar kinematical information is available till @xmath47 150 ; therefore a fit of an exponential disc was made to the outer range of this 150  resulting in a disc scalelength @xmath48 of 43  and disc central ( not corrected to face - on ) surface brightness @xmath49 of 18.7 mag .",
    "this disc was subtracted from the total i - band photometry and to the remainder an @xmath50 law :    @xmath51    was fitted , where @xmath52 is the surface brightness in magnitudes , @xmath53 , and @xmath42 the effective radius . in this and forthcoming cases",

    "bulge and disc parameters are given in table 2 .",
    "the smallest possible bulge contribution was determined as follows .",
    "if the bulge is spherical as indicated by the central ellipticity and the disc generates the larger ellipticity for @xmath54 15 then the bulge / disc transition should be near the middle of this radial extent .",
    "it appeared that such a situation can be achieved using an exponential disc with scalelength of 25 until @xmath55 60  and following the total light for @xmath54 60 . a disc with this scalelength is equal to the disc fit of p96 to the k - band data , but that is a coincidence .",
    "again the bulge was found by subtracting the disc from the total light and fitting an @xmath50 law , of which the parameters are also given in table 2 .",
    "this whole procedure constructing the large and small bulge may seem somewhat arbitrary and in fact it is .",
    "still i feel confident that a good determination is given of the range of bulge / disc ratios ; which may be judged by inspecting the graphical representation of the result given in fig . 7 .",
    "nevertheless when comparing the results of the models with the actual data , both large and small bulge did not give satisfactory results .",
    "guided by experience obtained when doing this modelling it became clear that in fact a kinematical light decomposition could be made .",
    "that is to say , the narrow high velocity component of the line profile has to originate from the disc , while the broad underlying component comes from the bulge .",
    "therefore an estimate of the bulge / disc light ratio was made by considering the shape of the line profiles , all as a function of radius . such a determination is not very precise , but the initial resulting b / d ratio already produced a better agreement between model results and data .",
    "results were improved by increasing the initially estimated global b / d ratio with a factor two . in practice ,",
    "the derived b / d ratio as a function of radius was applied to the i - band photometry producing a disc and bulge luminosity radial profile . note that in this way both , the bulge and the disc radial light profile can be determined without any a priori constraint on the radial functionality . to the bulge profile again an @xmath50 law was fitted and then results a `` line profile determined '' bulge , or from now on `` lpd '' bulge , which is given graphically in fig .",
    "this lpd bulge has an effective radius comparable to that of the large bulge , while its surface brightness is lower ( table 2 ) , which ensures that it falls between the two extremes considered above .      to put the bulge into a 3d model for the galaxy the @xmath50 bulge(s ) have to be deprojected . for this a slight variation of the formula given by young ( @xcite )",

    "the bulge is assumed to be spherical . to check the influence of this assumption",
    "also situations with a flattened bulge ( with @xmath60 major / minor apparent axis = 2/1 ) have been investigated .",
    "it appeared that the results of the stellar kinematical modelling are not sensitive to such changes of the bulge morphology .",

    "the resulting value is given in table 2 .",
    "for the light along the major axis decompositions have now been described , which is the most important since the observed spectra are also situated along this major axis . to determine the total light of the bulge and disc , however , one has to know the b / d light ratio for the whole image .",
    "it took a small investigation to find a consistent picture for this galaxy .",
    "near the centre the ellipticity @xmath62 indicates a round situation , so at least for @xmath0 @xmath1 5the bulge is likely spherical .",
    "inspection of the image in fig .",
    "1 shows that a hazy component , which may be associated with the bulge , extends to at least half the image of the galaxy and appears to be pretty round .",
    "but that is , of course , only limited evidence that the bulge is spherical everywhere .",
    "additional evidence comes from considering the disc .",
    "the velocity field following from the 21 cm emission line gives an inclination of 75  with small error of one to two degrees .",
    "the ellipticity a disc with an inclination of 75  would produce is 0.72 for an intrinsic @xmath63 ratio of 0.11 ( guthrie @xcite ) .",
    "this differs considerably from the observed ellipticity of 0.60 .",
    "an explanation for this difference can only be found when ngc 7331 has a bulge which is much rounder than @xmath64 , producing that observed value in combination with an @xmath65 disc .",
    "combination of three pieces of evidence then leads to the conclusion that ngc 7331 has a spherical or nearly spherical bulge and a disc with projected ellipticity of 0.72 as expected for an inclination of 75 .",
    "given the lightprofiles ( in the i - band ) along the major axis for the three b / d decompositions the total light of bulge and disc can then be calculated and is given in table 3 .",

    "the observed spectroscopic data have to be related to the real internal velocity dispersions and stellar rotation of the galaxy .",

    "the effect of a dust layer has been neglected , as to the validity of this one is referred to the discussion in bottema ( @xcite ) . the observable dispersion generated by the disc",
    "is mainly determined by the dispersion in the tangential direction . for the inclination of 75  a small fraction of the perpendicular dispersion enters into the observations and because the disc has a certain thickness , also a fraction of the radial dispersion .    along the line of sight an integral line profile develops .",
    "this process is simulated by numerically integrating the kinematical model of the galaxy . the line profile obtained in that way",

    "this is because the integration step was 1 the seeing is of the same order and so close to the centre the 3d density distribution of the bulge is not well behaved",

    "it proved possible to fix the input rotation quite independently from these other parameters , to end up at a situation where the testparticle rotation increases gently from 255 at @xmath55 70  to 270 near the centre .",
    "it will be obvious that only such a global trend can be deduced and no details of the rotation curve .",
    "the three dimensional density distribution of the bulge is given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , and the ratio of bulge to disc density was fixed by comparing the surface brightness calculated from the model distributions with the actual bulge / disc surface brightness along the major axis as given in fig .",
    "7 . for the bulge kinematics",
    "a simple model was assumed .",
    "the velocity dispersion is isotropic and constant like an isothermal sphere .",
    "the bulge is cylindrically rotating with a rotation curve    @xmath87    where the bulge rotational core radius @xmath88 was kept fixed at 1 .",
    "it finally appeared that the maximum bulge rotation @xmath89 has to be considerably smaller than the disc rotation , but its value is only loosely constrained .",
    "consequently results and conclusions are not sensitive to any reasonable change of this bulge rotational core radius .",
    "to start this section a short description will be given of the main effects which there are on the observable quantities when changing a certain input parameter of the galaxy model .",
    "near the centre the bulge always dominates the light and hence the bulge dispersion is fixed by the dispersion observed near the centre . in the outer regions the disc dominates the dispersion but",
    "the bulge influence is not negligible . over there",
    "the disc generates a high and narrow line profile while the bulge contributes a broad low level component to the profile . because of the relatively broad ( compared to the disc ) instrumental profile this underlying bulge component is easily picked up even if the bulge is weak .",
    "one may wonder whether the bulge light continues substantially into the disc region and whether it is not cut off at a certain radius .",
    "the optical image of this galaxy argues against such a proposition ; the bulge remains visible as a faint haze well until radii where the spectroscopy ends .",
    "simulations with a disc only did not produce detectable asymmetric line profiles .",
    "consequently any asymmetry or large @xmath24 value must be generated by an unequal bulge and disc distribution and/or kinematics .",
    "increasing the difference between the disc and bulge rotation increases the observable dispersion in the transition region . in the mean time",
    "the observable asymmetry then becomes larger .",
    "first the large bulge situation was considered but it appeared impossible to match the observations .",
    "whatever the testparticle rotation of the disc , the bulge rotation in combination with its light distribution dominate the observable rotation , typically for radii @xmath1 40 .",
    "this results in a rotation much lower than what is observed .",
    "the dispersion was always too large between radii of 20 to 80  even when the disc dispersion was made very small .",
    "in addition , the @xmath24 parameter could never be made large enough .",
    "to summarize : a large bulge situation is really out of the question .",
    "next the small bulge was considered .",
    "the model parameters were adjusted to obtain the best fit to the observations of which the result is shown in fig . 8 and 9 for the dispersion and asymmetry respectively .",
    "this best fit has a central disc dispersion @xmath90 of 125 @xmath6 25 , a bulge dispersion of 125 @xmath6 10 and bulge rotation of approximately 30 . for a comparison of model and",
    "observed radial velocities and determination of the input testparticle rotation one is referred to the next section and fig .",
    "14 , because results concerning these matters are equal for the small and lpd bulge .",
    "there appears to be a reasonable resemblance in figures 8 and 9 between the data and the model , but the fits are certainly not perfect .",
    "for instance the model dispersion decreases nicely with radius , but too steeply compared to the observations . at the smaller radii , typically for @xmath0 @xmath1 30  the fitted dispersion is somewhat too large while for radii @xmath91 30  it is too small . the @xmath24 parameter ( fig .",
    "9 ) also follows the data , but the model values are a factor two smaller than the observations .",
    "one can make a larger @xmath24 parameter by lowering the bulge rotation to zero or to negative values (= counterrotation ) .",
    "but then also the dispersion values at the transition region between bulge and disc at @xmath0 @xmath9 10  increase and that is not consistent with the observations . already for the present best fit situation for the small bulge",
    "the model dispersion is a bit too large at @xmath33 10  so that one would prefer a larger bulge rotation , but then the @xmath24 parameter gets smaller . lowering the disc dispersion to decrease the dispersion at the transition region gives too low dispersions at large radii and is not a solution to the problem .",
    "several combinations of input parameters have been investigated , and the final best fitting result is given in figures 8 and 9 , a result which is not perfect and not satisfactory .",
    "the experience obtained when doing these fits for the small bulge situation paved the way towards a better solution .",
    "it became clear that in order to get a larger @xmath24 parameter a comparable bulge and disc intensity is needed over a larger range of radii .",
    "the largest asymmetry is there where the intensities are equal and the observations then indicate that this is between radii of 10 to 20 . considering this ,",
    "a larger effective radius of the bulge is needed , but the bulge should be less bright than for the large bulge situation .",
    "plotting of the model profiles at diverse radii showed that the individual contributions to this profile of bulge and disc can be distinguished and traced as a function of radius .",
    "this knowledge was applied to the observed profiles and it became clear that these too contain information about relative brightness of bulge and disc , leading to the construction of the lpd bulge situation .",
    "as in the previous section various combinations of input parameters have been investigated .",
    "comparison with the observations gave the best fit which is shown in figures 10 and 11 for the dispersion and asymmetry parameter as a function of radius .",
    "the central dispersion in the radial direction @xmath92 was determined at 140 @xmath6 30 for a bulge rotation and dispersion of 30 and 125 @xmath6 10 .",
    "this last value is fixed unambiguously because the bulge dominates the light near the centre .",
    "although a perfect fit could not be achieved for this bulge / disc decomposition , results are better than for the small bulge situation .",
    "a larger asymmetry parameter is obtained more in accordance with the observations .",
    "in addition the radial behaviour of the dispersion follows the data reasonably well .",
    "the rotation of the bulge is not so well constrained .",
    "effects of a different bulge rotation are shown in figures 12 and 13 .",
    "again the same trends as described in the previous section are apparent ; a lower bulge rotation gives a larger @xmath24 parameter and larger dispersion at radii between 5 to 20  where bulge and disc are comparable in brightness . for a bulge counterrotating with 20 a good fit",
    "is found to the asymmetry parameter , but the dispersions around 10  are considerably larger than what is observed . when the bulge rotates with 80 , the fit to the dispersions is perfect , but @xmath24 values are too small .",
    "therefore a compromise is found for a bulge rotation of 30 @xmath93 30 . in this respect",
    "it should be noted that the observed velocity dispersion is more trustworthy than the observed @xmath24 parameter , because the latter is more susceptable to small scale irregularities .",
    "for instance the small gully on the high and low velocity side of the line profiles ( fig .",
    "4 ) may have caused the @xmath24 values to be determined somewhat too large .",
    "the velocity dispersion is always a more global parameter .",
    "does the fact that the observed @xmath24 parameter can only be explained by a bulge counterrotating with 20 prove that ngc 7331 indeed has a counterrotating bulge ?",
    "if such a situation as explained above and illustrated in fig .",
    "13 is valid , it is totally different from the counterrotating bulge as proposed by p96 .",
    "that bulge is cold and counterrotates with @xmath9 50 , while the present bulge is hot ( disp = 125 ) and counterrotates with only 20 .",
    "some test line profile calculations have been done for a cold counterrotating bulge . as can be expected in the inner 5",
    "the calculated dispersion is much lower than observed and between 8and 25  the dispersion is much larger than observed .",
    "the @xmath24 parameter is irregular as a function of radius and even has the wrong sign at certain positions .",
    "thus a cold counterrotating bulge can not be made in agreement with the observed kinematics . instead of a completely counterrotating bulge",
    "one might argue for a counterrotating component inside this galaxy .",
    "this is not easy to investigate because a spatial distribution for such a component can only be guessed . in any way",
    ", such a component would increase the dispersion at the positions where it is situated , which is difficult to reconcile with the observed dispersions .",
    "still , a small counterrotating component inside the bulge or at the bulge / disc transition region can not completely be excluded . also judging the fits in fig .",
    "12 and 13 a slowly counterrotating hot bulge might just be possible .    when the fit to the dispersion in fig . 10 is considered in detail one can note the following . for @xmath0 @xmath91 25 by minimizing the difference between model curves and data there is an excellent fit to the data for @xmath90 = 140 @xmath6 30 .",
    "however for @xmath0 @xmath1 25  one would prefer a smaller disc dispersion : @xmath90 = 110 or even as low as 80 .",
    "then , not only the fit to the dispersion is better , but also , as can be seen in fig .",
    "11 , the line profiles are more asymmetric resembling more what is observed .",
    "but can this be done , such a smaller dispersion in the inner region ? in principle the dispersion over the whole radial extent is fixed by the disc surface brightness through eqs ( 6 ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) . but",
    "this assumes that the vertical scale parameter @xmath94 is the same at all radii .",
    "if @xmath69 can be made smaller for @xmath0 @xmath1 25  then the dispersion can also be made smaller while remaining consistent with the photometry .",
    "this is not even such a bad idea , in fact it is something which might be expected .",
    "inwards of @xmath0 = 25one is entering the bulge region where gas is sparce and star formation has nearly ceased .",
    "consequently there will be no spiral arms and no molecular clouds and the disc is prohibited from heating up ( lacey @xcite ) .",
    "the disc then remains colder and thinner than at those radii where there is star formation or where star formation has existed longer .",
    "such a lower value of @xmath69 at or near the bulge would obviously go undetected in observations of edge - on galaxies .",
    "certainly the kinematic data of ngc 7331 can be explained better by a thin and cold disc within the bulge .",
    "this fact , however , is not an overwhelming evidence for making thin and cold discs within bulges into a general hypothesis .    in fig .",
    "14 the radial velocities following from the model calculations are compared with the observed radial velocities .",
    "as described above , there is the freedom the choose the testparticle ( potential ) input rotation such that the calculated radial velocities match the observations .",
    "thus a comparison of radial velocities can not give an extra constraint on the velocity dispersion of the disc or on the bulge rotation .",
    "what can be concluded from fig .",
    "14 is that a testparticle rotation curve can be constructed which gives a consistent picture ; in this case for @xmath90 = 140 .",
    "the lpd bulge decomposition enables a reasonable reconstruction of the observations .",
    "it is likely that an even better fit can be made for slightly different bulge / disc decompositions , for instance for bulges which have brightness laws other than the @xmath50 employed so far .",
    "but the parameter space which then opens up is so vast that a huge amount of time is needed to investigate ; while only giving marginal improvements .",
    "some problems have to be discussed , however . changing the brightness ratio of model disc and bulge has a considerable effect on the dispersions in the disc dominated region .",
    "how well can one then constrain the dispersion of the disc ? fortunately this appears to be a smaller problem than expected .",
    "this is because the bulge / disc brightness ratio can not be changed at will ; one has to remain compatible with the observed photometry .",
    "in fact , during the construction of the lpd bulge situation an iteration was made to increase the bulge strength with a factor two at the transition radius .",
    "bulge parameters and disc surface brightness then had to be adapted to match the photometry .",
    "surprisingly , the derived disc dispersion turned out to be nearly equal before and after this change . the error generated by the not precisely determined bulge / disc brightness ratio",
    "is well comprised within the 30 error on the value of @xmath90 .",
    "another problem is that the large observed dispersions near @xmath0 = 100  can not be explained .",
    "looking at the fit to the data in fig .",
    "10 this problem looks worse than it is because of the strong oversampling of the data at that radius , caused by the adopted method of averaging along the slit . taking into account the horizontal error bars which show the amount of oversampling , there are only four independent measurements ( two on either side of the galaxy ) which have a large dispersion .",
    "still these four measurements can not be explained by a regular galactic disc situation and consequently the disc is not regular .",
    "a hotter disc by a factor of two locally at that radius seems unlikely because then a very local increased heating mechanism must have been present .",
    "more likely is a locally irregular stellar velocity field generating broader profiles over the 15  spatial resolution at those positions .",
    "evidence supporting this is the discrepant low apparent rotation at @xmath0 = 100on the north side only .",
    "the surface density of the disc as a function of radius @xmath95 is given by    @xmath96    when substituting @xmath97 for the derived disc dispersion and 7  = 506 pc for the value of @xmath69 a central surface density @xmath98 of 1027 @xmath6 440 @xmath16 pc@xmath45 is found . using eq .",
    "( 8) and @xmath99 i - mag . arcsec@xmath45 the mass - to - light ratio of the disc is 1.6 @xmath6 0.7 @xmath3 .",
    "some parameters entering into the calculation of surface density and m / l ratio have not been measured but are inferred from other studies .",
    "for example the factor 0.6 which might have a typical error of 0.1 ; the value of @xmath69 having some 20% error and there is the uncertainty of the correction to face - on surface brightness which is at present a simple cos(inclination ) factor . nevertheless , ngc",
    "7331 is a regular galaxy so that one may assume that these parameters have been given the appropriate value .",
    "the dominant source of errors is that of the dispersion anyway .    for a number of galactic discs stellar velocity dispersions",

    "combining these results leads to a disc m / l ratio of 1.8 @xmath6 0.4 in the b - band ( bottema @xcite ) .",
    "the value for ngc 7331 of 1.6 @xmath6 0.7 in the i - band is then consistent with the results for other galaxies under the likely assumption that the b - i colour of the disc of ngc 7331 is comparable to the solar value .",
    "this gives confidence that determined and assumed parameters for ngc 7331 are correct .    from the surface density as a function of radius",
    "the rotation curve has been calculated ( casertano @xcite ) which is shown in fig .",
    "the maximum rotation contributed by the disc is 102 at a radius of 3.8 kpc and the total mass of the stellar disc amounts to 17.8 10@xmath100 .",
    "the rotation curve for ngc 7331 is presented by the dots in fig .",
    "15 , and is given by the rotation for @xmath0 @xmath91 70  and by the iteration procedure to fit the stellar rotation for @xmath0 @xmath1 70 .",
    "the contribution to the total rotation of the disc is fixed by the observed dispersions , and the contribution of the gas is given by the amount of and he gas ( begeman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to obtain the observed rotation a contribution of the bulge has to be added , and to maintain the flat level at large radii a dark halo has to be invoked . for this dark halo a spherical pseudo isothermal sphere",
    "is assumed ( carignan & freeman @xcite ) with density law    @xmath101^{-1},\\ ] ]    and rotation    @xmath102    where the maximum halo rotation @xmath103 and the halo core radius @xmath104 are two free parameters which can be adjusted to match the observed rotation .",
    "a third free parameter is the total mass of the bulge .",
    "the surface brightness of the ( lpd ) bulge is given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) and parameters of table 2 .",
    "this description is all right for @xmath105 2 but , because of the steepness of the @xmath50 law near @xmath106 care was taken to use the observed surface brightness for @xmath46 2 .",
    "for an assumed spherical density distribution a rotation curve for the bulge can then be calculated from the surface brightness and m / l ratio using the equation on page 1310 of kent ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the m / l ratio of the bulge is taken equal to that of the disk ( 1.6 in i ) then the maximum rotation contributed by the bulge is 125 at @xmath107 kpc .",
    "a least squares procedure was used to fit the quadratic sum of the rotation curves of disc , gas , bulge , and dark halo to the observed rotation .",
    "the total mass of the bulge became fixed at 87.3 10@xmath100 if the bulge would extend until @xmath0 = 300  and at 77.7 10@xmath100 if it extends until @xmath0 = 150 .",
    "for the latter , using the total light from table 3 one finds a m / l ratio of the bulge of 6.8 @xmath3 , being a factor 4.3 larger than the m / l ratio of the disc .",
    "the free parameters of the halo became fixed at @xmath108 5.9 kpc and @xmath109 224 .",
    "the fit of the sum of the rotation curves is shown in fig .",
    "15 , together with the contributions of the individual components .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "15 it is obvious that bulge and dark halo dominate the potential for the whole galaxy and the disc only provides a minor contribution .",
    "if the m / l ratios of bulge and disc are fixed to be equal then , in addition to providing the rotation at large radii , the halo also has to provide most of the rotation at small radii , leading to a very small core radius .",
    "such a scenario is not very realistic . for the free fit of the three parameters ,",
    "the bulge mass is always determined nearly completely by the innermost rotation points .",
    "changing , for example , the m / l ratio of the disc to 2.5 , the maximum allowed by the error on the dispersion , the total bulge mass only decreases from 77.7 to 72.9 10@xmath110 but @xmath111 goes down to 2.6 instead of 4.3 .",
    "a summary of the relevant parameters and fitted values is given in table 4 .",
    "there is at least one obvious conclusion following from the rotation curve analysis and that is that a bulge considerably more massive than the disc is needed , having a m / l ratio which is also considerably larger than the disc",

    "it appears that the literature gives essentially two methods to determine a bulge m / l ratio . at first",

    "if this proves to be impossible , a solution might be to add dark matter , baryonic or non - baryonic , to the bulge .",

    "1 disc velocity dispersions of 12 galaxies have been plotted versus the absolute luminosity in b of the old disc population . to include ngc 7331 in this sample , first its old disc only absolute magnitude has to be calculated and secondly the radial dispersion at one scalelength .",
    "the absolute magnitude for the whole galaxy amounts to -21.73 , which is corrected for internal and galactic extinction and taken from sandage & tammann ( @xcite ) , converted to a distance of 14.9 mpc . to subtract the light of the bulge the bulge / disc total light ratio of 0.9 in the i - band was converted to a value of 0.56 in the b - band . for this an average bulge b - i colour of 2.3 mag .",
    "was assumed , which is the average value of a number of large bulges as observed by peletier & balcells ( @xcite ) , and an average disc b - i colour of 1.8 , taken from de jong & van der kruit ( @xcite ) . to get the absolute magnitude of the old disc only , 0.48 mag .",
    "was added to the total galaxy value to subtract the bulge light .",
    "then another 0.32 mag . was added to subtract the young disc light ( bottema @xcite ) for an estimated b - v disc colour of 0.8 .",
    "finally we have @xmath130 for ngc 7331 .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion at any radius is given by @xmath131 . to obtain the value at @xmath132 ,",
    "first @xmath133 was determined as the average of @xmath133 = 43  ( large bulge ) and @xmath133 = 62  ( scalelength in outer regions ) giving @xmath133 = 52@xmath6 10 . for @xmath97 one",
    "gets @xmath134 . if this value is plotted in fig .",
    "1 of b93 it turns out that the dispersion is low for its brightness ; nearly a factor of two lower than the dispersions of other galactic discs .",
    "now the errors are substantial and statistically there is not a disagreement . still one may wonder about the cause of this low value ; several possibilities exist .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "10 , where the dispersions are given , at @xmath132 = 52the observed dispersion is 45 @xmath6 10 . assuming the observed dispersion is approximately the tangential dispersion and @xmath135 ( for a flat rotation curve )",
    ", the radial dispersion at @xmath132 should amount to 64 while in reality the `` input '' or internal disc value is 38 @xmath6 11 .",
    "how is that possible ?",
    "a detailed consideration of the modelling procedure shows that at first some 8 to 10 can be added to the input value of 38 caused by integration effects .",
    "the remaining 16 to 18 difference can be accounted for by the bulge .",
    "this shows that the bulge still has a considerable effect on the observable dispersion even at one radial scalelength , and that @xmath136 is consistent with the observations .",
    "an other reason for the low dispersion might be that the disc of ngc 7331 is not exponential and that instead of @xmath133 = 52  the scalelength that should have been assumed is smaller , leading to a larger value of @xmath137 .",
    "this demonstrates the limitation of the parameterization of the data in fig . 1 of b93 .",
    "therefore presenting an m / l value is better and for ngc 7331 indeed , the derived @xmath124 of 1.6 is in agreement with values of other galactic discs . on the other hand , it can not be excluded that a substantial scatter in the @xmath137/abs . mag .",
    "relation is intrinsic .",
    "this might be caused by a range of edge - on aspect ratios for equal mass discs as a result of different heating rates .",
    "that again may be the result of different star formation histories or environment effects .",
    "for example the massive bulge of ngc 7331 can have had a profound stabilizing effect on the disc so that less disc heating has appeared .    from the discussion above it is clear that in order to investigate or measure the stellar velocity dispersion of discs it is advisable to observe only galaxies with small bulges .",
    "the sample of 12 discs is still small and an extension is needed to make a more accurate determination of the m / l ratio of discs .",
    "in addition , or maybe first because it is relatively easy to do , it would be very useful to determine the aspect ratio ( or @xmath138 ) of edge - on galaxies and to find the functionality with disc mass and scatter onto that functionality",
    ". that will give insight into the evolution and star formation history of discs and allow a better interpretation of the disc dispersion / luminosity relation .    another matter to be discussed",
    "is the larger m / l ratio of bulges compared to that of discs .",
    "if that is indeed true for most galaxies , there are cosmological consequences .",
    "because bulges are relatively old and have undergone little recent star formation , there must have been a considerable fading over the last 5 gyrs .",
    "that implies that around 5 gyrs ago , typically at @xmath139 the bulge to disc light ratio must have been larger than presently .",
    "such an effect should be detectable in deep field observations and may compromise galaxy type classification for large look back times .    finally a compilation of the main conclusions :    1 .",
    "the determined kinematics of the ionized gas and of the stars is regular and symmetric with respect to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "2 .   for @xmath46 40",
    "the emission line gas appears to rotate slower than the stars .",
    "a likely explanation is an inclined and warped ( w.r.t the plane ) gas layer in the inner regions .",
    "3 .   in the bulge dominated region",
    "the absorption line profiles are asymmetric ; they have a shallow extension towards the systemic velocity .",
    "no counterrotating component is observed .",
    "previous claims of a counterrotating component might be based on a wrong interpretation of the data .",
    "a galaxy consisting of a bulge and disc with different kinematics is able to explain the asymmetric stellar line profiles .",
    ".   a satisfactory fit to the observed kinematics is found for a rapidly rotating disc with radially decreasing dispersion and a slowly rotating bulge with a constant , 125 dispersion .",
    "an even better fit can be made when the disc is relatively thinner and colder in the bulge region compared to the disc outside the bulge .",
    "the bulge influences the observable dispersion to well beyond its light dominated region .",
    "the observed disc dispersion gives @xmath140 , consistent with previous determinations .",
    "the bulge mass - to - light ratio is @xmath141 .",
    "the disc contributes only in a minor way to the mass content of ngc 7331 .",
    "13 . for a sample of discs and bulges",
    "one has on average @xmath142 and converted to the b - band @xmath143 .",
    "suppose the observed absorption line spectrum of a galaxy is given by @xmath144 and the spectrum of a template star representative of the galaxy s spectral content is given by @xmath145 .",
    "then @xmath146 can be described as a convolution of @xmath147 with the line of sight velocity distribution , or simply line profile @xmath148 :      where @xmath19 is the speed of light and conversion to a @xmath150 scale is needed to put the spectrum on a linear velocity scale . to retrieve the line profile @xmath148 eq .",
    "( a1 ) has to be inverted .",
    "the ugd procedure is one of the methods to accomplish this .",
    "it assumes that the line profile can be described by the sum of a collection of equidistant gaussian functions with a fixed dispersion",
    ". then one can solve for the amplitudes of the gaussians that yield a line profile whose convolution with the stellar template @xmath151 gives the best fit to the observed galaxy spectrum @xmath152 .",
    "this solving is done by a least squares fitting procedure which also gives the errors matching the best fitting line profile .",
    "suppose the dispersion of the gaussians is @xmath153 , then the separation of the gaussians should be not more than @xmath154 .",
    "obviously any features on scales less than @xmath153 can not be retrieved .",
    "here one also has the usual trade - off between resolution and noise ; a higher resolution gives a noisier profile and vice versa .",
    "the cross - correlation clean method ( ccc ) is described in sect 2.3 . in order to invert eq .",
    "( a1 ) an intermediate step is used by calculating the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of the galaxy and template spectrum :          this has the advantage that all the absorption lines in the spectrum have been combined in a single peaked ccf ; hence the noise is already considerably lower before any fitting or deconvolution procedures are applied . to retrieve the line profile @xmath148 the ccf is deconvolved using the clean method ( hgbom @xcite ) with the template @xmath156 as beam ( or point spread function ) .",
    "the resolution of the retrieved line profile is uniform and is set explicitly .",
    "it can be as high as allowed by the sampling criterion .",
    "again one has the usual trade - off between noise and resolution .      when applied to spectra of the inner region of ngc 7331",
    ", ugd produces a counterrotating component while ccc produces only an asymmetric line profile . to investigate this discrepancy",
    "both procedures have been tested on a few artificial asymmetric line profiles .",
    "this testing scheme is not meant to be an exhaustive investigation , but only to highlight some aspects .",
    "the average template spectrum used for the analysis of the ngc 7331 data ( 30.2 pixel@xmath17 , 2040 pixels around 5100  ) was convolved with an asymmetric line profile .",
    "noise was , or was not , added and the resulting spectrum was considered to be the ( test ) galaxy spectrum .",
    "ugd was then applied using the unconvolved spectrum as template and it was attempted to retrieve the input line profile .",
    "the parameters of ugd were equal to those used by p96 and used for the ugd analysis of ngc 7331 described in sect 3.4 ; namely a gaussian dispersion of two velocity pixels and a separation of 3 pixels .    for galaxy spectra with no noise",
    "added results for three different line profiles are shown in fig .",
    "a1 ; where the input profile as given by the line is compared with the profile determined by ugd .",
    "formal fitting errors are superposed on the fit , but these are small in this case . in the top panel",
    "the input line profile is equal to that generated by the line profile calculation procedure described in sect . 5 , for ngc 7331 with an lpd bulge , @xmath90 = 110 , @xmath158 , at a distance of 20from the nucleus .",
    "at that radial distance the observed counterrotating component stands out very clearly . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "a1 a relatively broad profile is shown , while the lower panel depicts the fitting result to a narrow profile with a long one sided extension . as can be seen , ugd gives a good reconstruction of the profiles in the upper and middle panels .",
    "the profile in the lower panel , however , is badly reproduced ; next to the main profile there have appeared two distinct aliasing features not present in the input profile .",
    "but here some care should have been taken that has not been .",
    "a part of the input profile is narrower than the ugd resolution and hence ugd can never reproduce the profile .",
    "taking a set of narrower gaussians improves the reconstruction .",
    "unfortunately in practice one has the problem that it is not known in advance how narrow any galactic profile is , consequently making a suitable choice of ugd parameters is not straightforward .",
    "next noise was added to the artificial galaxy spectra for a s / n level of 20 .",
    "results of the ugd reconstruction procedure for the same three input profiles are shown in fig a2 .",
    "now also for the profiles in the top and middle panel the fit starts to deviate from the input ; aliasing features are produced on the wing side of the profile .",
    "these aliasing features are equal to what may be interpreted as a counterrotating component in a bulge - disc situation .",
    "remember that the top profile is equal to what actually may be expected to occur for ngc 7331 in the `` counterrotating '' region .",
    "considering the errors , however , these aliasing features are not significant .",
    "the correct interpretation of the ugd result should be to disregard these features , but to arrive at this correct interpretation the fit errors have to be presented .",
    "when one has a number of subsequent skewed profiles all having such aliases produced by ugd and no erros are given , a counterrotating component seems to be present , while in reality it is an artifact .",
    "this is what may have misled p96 to postulate a counterrotating bulge in ngc 7331 .    lowering the s / n level in general increases the magnitude of the aliases .",
    "this can be seen , for example , when comparing the lower panels of figures a1 and a2 where the too narrow profile is presented .",
    "a short investigation has been done to see if the ugd fit may be improved when the width and separations of the gaussians are decreased . to that aim @xmath153 was put at 1@xmath159 pixel and the separation at 2 pixels and the fitting procedure was rerun for the same profiles and s / n levels . for the no - noise case the reconstruction of the profile in the bottom panel has improved although still some significant aliasing remains .",
    "the other two profiles , however , have become somewhat more irregular .",
    "when noise is put on for a s / n = 20 , in all cases substantial aliasing appears accompanied with a substantial increase of the errors of the fitted profiles .",
    "if one had to judge the reconstructed profiles , one would have concluded that the s / n is too low , or a set of wider gaussians is needed .",
    "many more tests could have been performed .",
    "for instance for different noise levels , for different dispersions and separations of the gaussians , and the effects of template mismatch could have been investigated using an additional different template spectrum . to some",
    "this will be interesting but for the present case an adequate explanation of the appearing features has been given .",
    "in fact , the ugd testing as described above is complementary to the test results that km93 obtained in their original paper describing the method . from that paper",
    "it is already clear that problems may arise for skewed profiles .",
    "therefore kuijken and merrifield issue two clear warnings when applying ugd :    1 .",
    "`` the errors always have to be superposed on the fit especially for noisy data such that a careful analysis can be made '' 2 .",
    "`` the size of the errorbars can be reduced by making the gaussian components broader with a larger separation .",
    "however , when the profile is narrower than the gaussians spurious features may be introduced ''    in practice the second warning will always cause a problem because one does not know in advance the dispersion of the stellar population or subpopulations investigated . so any small feature generated by ugd needs a further investigation to establish its reality .",
    "an additional problem associated with ugd is its hybrid resolution .",
    "features with dispersion less than @xmath153 are unresolved while broader features are resolved .",
    "this may cause problems when interpreting the data .",
    "for the same template spectrum and the same three line profiles the ccc method has been investigated .",
    "the ccf was calculated between test galaxy and template .",
    "this ccf was then cleaned , subtracting components until below the noise level .",
    "the line profile was restored by convolving the components with a gaussian having a resolution of 2@xmath159 velocity pixels ( as for the data analysis of ngc 7331 ) and by adding the residuals .",
    "the errors were determined by measuring the standard deviation in a region on the sides of the profile . that value was assumed to be a representative error for all pixels of the profile .",
    "the reconstructed profile should now be equal to the input profile convolved with a gaussian of 2@xmath159 pixels . in fig .",
    "a3 this comparison is made for a s / n level of 20 .",
    "as can be seen , the agreement between input and reconstructed profile is very satisfactory for all three cases .",
    "the errors are considerably smaller than those of ugd for the same s / n ratio although a comparison with ugd is not completely fair because ugd tries to reconstruct the profile at full resolution , ccc not . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "a3 one may notice that ccc has the same tendency as ugd to make the profile a bit too narrow in the top .",
    "on the other hand , the bottom panel shows that ccc does not give any problems reconstructing extremely narrow and skewed profiles .",
    "naturally ccc has its disadvantages ; the most obvious being that the reconstructed profile is always convolved to a certain ( but uniform ) resolution .",
    "the biggest advantage of the method is that it can be applied without any prior knowledge of the actual galactic line profile .",
    "in addition it is straightforward in the sense that no iterative fitting is involved .",
    "the observations presented in this paper are obtained with the isaac newton telescope which is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",

    "<S> an even better fit to the data can be achieved when the disc is relatively thinner and colder inside the bulge region .    for the disc the stellar velocity dispersions and photometry result in a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath2 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this value agrees with previous determinations for other discs using observed velocity dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> a rotation curve analysis allows the calculation of the mass - to - light ratio of the bulge which amounts to 6.8 in the i - band ; considerably larger than the disc value . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the mass distribution of ngc 7331 is completely dominated by the combination of bulge and dark halo at all radii . comparing well determined mass - to - light ratios of a number of bulges with disc values , on average , @xmath4 is three times as large as @xmath5 in the i - band . for the b - band </S>",
    "<S> this ratio goes up to 7.2 , a fact which should have cosmological consequences . </S>"
