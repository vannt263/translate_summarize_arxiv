    "the discovery of the kuiper belt @xcite created a new vista upon the formation and early evolution of the solar system .",
    "study of these objects basic physical properties of course requires sufficiently well - determined orbital parameters to deduce a future position and the distance to the object .",
    "the orbital parameters are themselves of great interest , with the phase space of orbits threaded by an intricate web of resonant and long - lived chaotic zones @xcite . for both the practical goal of object retrieval and the higher goal of understanding the dynamical structure of the population , it is essential to not only have accurate orbits but also to quantify the _ uncertainty _ in the orbit .    there are centuries - old methods for determination of orbital parameters from observed positions .",
    "present - day desktop computers execute these solutions trivially , and a linearized propagation of the positional uncertainties into the orbital elements is straightforward as well @xcite .",
    "workstations are even fast enough to bound the uncertainty region with a brute - force sampling of the 6-dimensional orbit space in many cases .",
    "why then should we bother developing another orbit - fitting technique ?",
    "kbos pose a particular challenge because the objects are faint , so recovery observations are quite costly , requiring substantial investment of 24-meter telescope time for all but the brightest known objects . as a consequence , most known objects",
    "have been observed only a few times , leading to substantial degeneracies in the orbit fits .",
    "we need to know the error ellipse ( in sky position and in orbital parameter space ) even in the face of these degeneracies . in the best case",
    "a brute - force method will work on underdetermined orbits but leave us ignorant of the nature of the degeneracy . in the worst case",
    "the degeneracies will lead to long or effectively infinite computation times .",
    "the minor planet center ( mpc ) ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/mpc.html ) provides orbital elements and predicted ephemerides for new objects .",
    "the approach of the mpc to short - arc objects is to select the simplest `` sensible '' orbit that fits the data_e.g . _ a circular orbit ,",
    "if it fits the data and does not imply a close approach to neptune ; a 3:2 resonant orbit with neptune if the circular orbit would imply a close approach ; or , if the circular orbit is a poor fit , a `` visl '' orbit , with the object near perihelion @xcite , if this does not imply a close encounter .",
    "the mpc orbits in effect remove the degeneracies by assuming that the orbit is most likely to resemble those of known objects , and consequently predict positions that in most cases are quite close to the actual recovery positions .",
    "there are a few difficulties with this approach , however : first , focussing recovery efforts on the positions predicted by these favored orbits will inevitably bias the recovered population toward such orbits .",
    "this makes it difficult to quantify the portion of the population which may be in unusual orbits as they are preferentially lost .",
    "second , uncertainties on positions and orbital elements are not currently available from the minor planet center .",
    "positional uncertainties are essential for proper planning and evaluation of recovery observations .",
    "uncertainties on orbital elements are important for analyses of the dynamical characteristics of the population .",
    "for example , there was speculation that the 2:1 resonance with neptune was empty or underpopulated , but 1997 sz@xmath0 and 1996 tr@xmath1 were reclassified from 3:2 resonators to 2:1 resonators after further observations .",
    "finally , it is sometimes necessary to calculate orbits `` on the fly '' during an observing run , and the mpc should not be expected to provide instantaneous analyses .",
    "our approach to orbit - fitting for kbos is motivated and guided by the following differences from the historically more common application to the asteroid population :    * recovery observations are very expensive , as noted .",
    "this leads us to investigate , in  [ optimal ] , the minimal number of observations required to reach a given accuracy in orbital elements .",
    "the prediction of future positions should be a stable procedure even in the presence of nearly - degenerate orbital elements .",
    "this will require that we fully understand the nature of the degeneracies from short arcs .",
    "we would like to find a parameterization of the orbits in which the degeneracies are confined to as few parameters as possible . *",
    "the release of the usno - a2.0 astrometric catalog now makes it possible to measure astrometric positions to 02 accuracy over the full sky @xcite in a typical ccd image , and to produce reasonable estimates of the uncertainties on each position measurement .",
    "uncertainty estimation can therefore proceed by the straightforward propagation of measurement errors .",
    "space telescopes and adaptive - optics ground - based telescopes will commonly produce relative positions to 001 accuracy in the near future .",
    "very accurate positions should in principle produce accurate orbits even over relatively short arcs .",
    "* kbos are at distances @xmath2  au so their apparent motions are dominated by reflex motion .",
    "the observed arcs are a small fraction of the orbital period @xmath3 even after a decade .",
    "apparent motion patterns are thus very simple and unambiguous in comparison , say , to near - earth objects . *",
    "if we parameterize the distance to the object by @xmath4 , the acceleration of the kbo is @xmath5 times smaller than earth s acceleration , and the component transverse to the line of sight is @xmath6 times earth s .",
    "the kbo motion is nearly inertial , and gravitational acceleration can be treated as a perturbation . instead of parameterizing orbits by the usual element vector @xmath7 , an orbit is more stably specified by some cartesian phase space vector @xmath8 at the time of initial observation .",
    "* the annual parallax is limited to @xmath9 , and the total object motion is only @xmath10 over a decade .",
    "we will therefore express sky positions as coordinates @xmath11 in a tangent - plane projection of the celestial sphere about an appropriate reference point , _",
    "e.g. _ the first observed location .",
    "furthermore , the line of sight to the object changes by only a few degrees , and we will find it convenient to align our cartesian coordinates with the @xmath12 axis along the initial line of sight . *",
    "daily parallax is @xmath13 . for most ground - based observations",
    "this will be too small to yield useful information .",
    "the input data are the observed right ascension and declination @xmath14 of the target at times @xmath15 .",
    "we will assume that all positions have been measured in the j2000 celestial reference frame via astrometry tied to background stars in the usno - a2 catalog .",
    "measuring relative to the background stars exactly cancels the effects of stellar aberration , and reduces the maximal error from gravitational deflection of starlight to the milli - arcsecond level , so we can treat the problem with euclidean geometry .",
    "we transform the observed coordinates to a tangent - plane projection @xmath16 about a reference location @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 axis is taken in the eastward direction of the j2000 ecliptic coordinate system , and @xmath19 points toward j2000 ecliptic north .",
    "formulae for the conversion from @xmath20 to @xmath16 are straightforward and summarized in appendix  [ sphere ] .",
    "figure  [ coords ] illustrates the relation of our coordinate systems to the ecliptic .",
    "we will generally take this projection axis to be the first observed position , and will take the first observation to be at time @xmath21 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath18 and @xmath19 have equal and uncorrelated measurement uncertainties @xmath22 ( generalization to non - circular error regions is straightforward ) .",
    "we define our inertial cartesian coordinate system by placing the origin at ( or near ) the location of the observer at the initial epoch @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath12 axis is directed toward the reference direction @xmath24 of the tangent - plane projection , _",
    "i.e. _ along the initial line of sight .",
    "the @xmath25 axis is in the plane containing the @xmath12 axis and the j2000 north ecliptic pole , _",
    "i.e. _ parallel to the @xmath19 axis of the tangent plane .",
    "the @xmath26 axis then lies in the ecliptic plane and points along @xmath18 to ecliptic east .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we will take the units of distance and time to be au and julian year , respectively .",
    "the coordinate systems are illustrated in figure  [ coords ] .    if @xmath27 represents the position of the target at time @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the position of the observer on earth , then the observed sky position at time @xmath28 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the light - travel time @xmath32 .",
    "the definition of @xmath31 is recursive but in practice is easily solved for iteratively because of the lack of ambiguity in kbo orbit solutions .",
    "we wish our uncertainties to be limited by the errors in the astrometric catalog , so our requirement is to model the target position to @xmath33 accuracy over @xmath34-year time spans . for target distance",
    "@xmath35  au , the object and observer positions must be correct to @xmath36  km .",
    "the earth s position relative to the sun and solar system barycenter ( ssb ) is available from the jpl de405 ephemeris @xcite to an accuracy many orders of magnitude better than we require .",
    "a simplistic model of the earth as an oblate spheroid in constant rotation gives the observatory position to accuracy well within our tolerance , so we may consider @xmath37 to be known exactly .",
    "the interpolated jpl ephemeris and topocentric correction are rapidly calculable .",
    "we write the target orbit as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gravitational perturbation satisfying @xmath40 }      \\over { |{\\bf x}(t)-{\\bf x}_j(t)|^3 } } , \\label{nbody}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over the other bodies in the solar system .",
    "we include forces from the sun and the giant planets , obtaining their positions from the de405 ephemeris . for objects beyond 30",
    "au , one could approximate the total gravitational field of the solar system as a monopole originating the solar system barycenter , with errors of only @xmath41  au over 10 years ( barring neptune encounters ) , yielding positions accurate to @xmath42 . the computational expense of the full n - body form eq .",
    "( [ nbody ] ) is insignificant , however , as the time steps in the orbit integration can be quite long ( 20 days or more ) without significant loss of accuracy over a decade .    the combination of eqs .",
    "( [ exact ] ) , ( [ orbit1 ] ) , and ( [ nbody ] ) define our model for the position @xmath16 as a function of time and the initial state vector @xmath43 .",
    "a comparison of our positions for pluto , neptune , and 1992 qb1 to those generated by the jpl ephemeris indicate residual differences of @xmath44 for a 10-year integration .",
    "we can understand the nature of the short - arc degeneracies by expanding eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) in powers of time @xmath28 and distance parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the formulae are simpler if we redefine our phase space basis in terms of the vector @xmath46 , where @xmath47 please note that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 quantify the motion along our three axes but are _ not _ the time derivatives of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we have chosen our coordinate system so that @xmath53 , and we expect @xmath54 for bound orbits . if the orbit is nearly circular , the line - of - sight velocity is down another factor of @xmath45 so that @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath26 component of the apparent motion is now @xmath56 in the second line we have made the approximation that @xmath57  year .",
    "the equation for @xmath19 is analogous .",
    "we see that the solution for the orbital parameters @xmath58 has three regimes :      for arcs spanning consecutive nights , we can only determine the instantaneous positions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , plus the slopes @xmath59 the approximations assume that we are observing near the ecliptic plane , and that the earth s orbit is circular with phase @xmath60 at time @xmath23 relative to the sun - target vector .",
    "in this situation the line - of - sight motion @xmath50 is completely unconstrained , and there is a total degeneracy between the distance @xmath45 and the ecliptic motion @xmath48 . for a circular orbit , @xmath61 , and for any bound orbit @xmath62 .",
    "the usual observational strategy , therefore , is to observe near opposition ( @xmath63 ) to minimize the proper - motion term @xmath48 relative to the parallax term @xmath64 , giving an estimate of @xmath45 to fractional accuracy of @xmath65 or better .",
    "an ephemeris may be predicted under the assumption of a prograde circular orbit . below we will describe a simple way to place an error ellipse on the position without assuming a circular orbit .",
    "as the arc length grows , the next bit of information gleaned is the apparent acceleration vector : @xmath66 the second line again assumes an ecliptic observation and a circular earth orbit , and keeps leading - order terms only .",
    "we see first that the effect of @xmath50 on the acceleration is a factor @xmath67 smaller than the @xmath68 term . in this regime , therefore , @xmath50 is still indeterminate .",
    "the target s transverse acceleration @xmath69 is smaller by a factor @xmath70 than the earth s acceleration and can also be ignored at this point .",
    "the apparent acceleration is then @xmath71 we see that the apparent acceleration is a robust and simple way to constrain @xmath45 , the distance to the target .",
    "this method fails however , for observations at opposition ( @xmath63 ) , where the reflex acceleration vanishes .",
    "what time span is needed to measure the acceleration to a useful accuracy ?",
    "let us presume that the object is initially detected in a pair of observations separated by 24 hours , then recovered in a single observation some time @xmath72 later , and that each observation has astrometric uncertainty @xmath73 . using eq .",
    "( [ accel ] ) to determine @xmath45 , the fractional error in the distance to the target is then roughly @xmath74 the distance to most kbos can be determined from the apparent acceleration with only 1 week s arc , _ as long as the observations are not near opposition .",
    "_ for a main belt asteroid , the apparent acceleration is an order of magnitude larger and is easily detected in a 24-hour span .",
    "this means it is easy to distinguish main belt asteroids from kbos away from opposition , even near the main - belt turnaround points .    a typical ( non - opposition )",
    "1-week arc thus gives a useful estimate of 5 of the 6 phase - space parameters of the orbit , with the line - of - sight motion being completely indeterminate .",
    "in this basis the degeneracy is confined to a single parameter , whereas the degeneracy is shared between most of the traditional orbital elements . in particular",
    "neither @xmath75 nor @xmath76 is at all well constrained at this point .",
    "it is interesting to note that the orbital angular momentum is sensibly constrained in this regime , since the line - of - sight velocity is nearly radial to the sun and contributes little to the angular momentum . the energy of the orbit , however , is @xmath77 and is uncertain until @xmath50 can be constrained .",
    "here @xmath78 is the solar elongation of the target at the initial epoch .      the line - of - sight velocity can be constrained as the earth moves around its orbit to give us a new point of view . from eq .",
    "( [ abgposn ] ) , the leading @xmath50 term in the sky position is @xmath79 .",
    "we know that @xmath80 from the simple constraint that the object be bound .",
    "a useful constraint on @xmath50 is obtained only after sufficient time that a @xmath50 value below the binding limit would produce a measured displacement that is distinguishable from terms in the other 5 parameters .",
    "this can occur on a timescale of months for high - quality observations . the uncertainty in @xmath50 ( or @xmath81 )",
    "dominates the phase space uncertainties for essentially all lengths of arc , though it does not always dominate the ephemeris uncertainties .      with 3 or more observations spanning several months or more",
    ", we will be in the fully - constrained regime . at this point",
    "the constraint of the orbital parameter vector @xmath58 from the measured positions @xmath82 becomes a straightforward non - linear minimization problem .",
    "the formalism for bayesian orbit fitting is discussed in detail by @xcite .",

    "( [ abgdef ] ) , ( [ exact ] ) , ( [ orbit1 ] ) , and ( [ nbody ] ) .",
    "the minimization of @xmath86 can use standard algorithms .",
    "we have implemented a slight modification of the levenberg - marquardt method from @xcite .",
    "for efficient location of the minimum , we require a good starting point for the non - linear search , and estimates of the derivative matrix @xmath87 .",
    "the determination of the derivatives is again greatly simplified for distant objects .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is , over a @xmath88-year period , a small perturbation to the inertial motion , barring close encounters .",
    "the inertial motion will be @xmath89 and the acceleration term will integrate to @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore the acceleration is toward the barycenter , so the transverse component is down by another factor of @xmath45 .",
    "the angular displacement due to gravity is only a few arcseconds per year , @xmath91 times smaller than the inertial motion and reflex motion .",
    "it is clear that in calculating the derivative matrix @xmath92 from eq .",
    "( [ orbit1 ] ) that we can ignore the gravitational term .",
    "all of the derivatives are thus quite trivial and there is no need to integrate the derivatives of the orbit .",
    "selection of a sensible starting point for the minimization is also simple for distant objects .",
    "we produce a version of the equations of motion which ignores gravity , is linearized , and also ignores the @xmath50 term : @xmath93 these equations are linear in the parameter vector @xmath58 and hence have a closed - form minimization requiring only the inversion of a @xmath94 matrix @xcite .",
    "these very simple equations are actually good to a few arcseconds for the first year of observation , and in any case provide ( with @xmath95 ) a good starting point for the non - linear minimization .",
    "using the analytic derivatives , the levenberg - marquardt algorithm also calculates the covariance matrix @xmath96 of the fitted parameters .",
    "since the model @xmath97 is dominated by terms linear in the parameters , the linearized approximation @xmath98 will be accurate even for poorly constrained orbits .",
    "this would not have been the case had we chosen the orbital - element vector @xmath99 as the parameter set .      once the best - fit @xmath83 vector and its covariance matrix are determined from the fit , determination of orbital elements and future positions is also simple .",
    "the predicted position at any time @xmath28 is @xmath100 .",
    "the uncertainty ellipse for the position is specified by the covariance matrix @xmath101 the derivatives , as above , are rapidly calculated by ignoring gravity . again the position is nearly linear in our chosen orbital basis , so this linearized transformation will be accurate even in the case of large uncertainties in the parameters .",
    "the best - fit orbital element vector @xmath102 is determined from the best - fit phase - space parameter set @xmath83 via the usual equations , which are reviewed in appendix  [ elements ] .",
    "the determination of an uncertainty ellipsoid in orbital - element space requires mapping of the covariance matrix with the derivatives @xmath103 .",
    "some of these derivatives are quite complicated analytic expressions , but can still be coded and rapidly evaluated .",
    "the map from @xmath58 to @xmath104 is non - linear , and in some cases degenerate , so the linearized covariance matrix is formally correct only when the uncertainties in the elements become small .",
    "we do , however , obtain a useful estimate of the element uncertainties even for less exact determinations .",
    "if the arc is too short , the minimization of @xmath86 will proceed but the best - fit parameters may be non - physical .",
    "the degeneracy in the `` acceleration regime '' will be manifested as one or more large elements of the covariance matrix . in particular",
    ", several - week orbits will have large values of @xmath105 .",
    "we recognize these orbits as unrealistic because they may be unbound .",
    "the assumption of a bound orbit limits @xmath50 to ( _ cf . _ eq .  [ [ energy ] ] ) @xmath106 a conservative approach to assigning uncertainties in this case is to assume that @xmath50 has a uniform _ a priori _ probability in the interval @xmath107 $ ] . if , however , we assign a gaussian prior distribution to @xmath50 , we can preserve our least - squares approach to the fitting problem .",
    "we therefore fit by assuming that @xmath95 with an rms uncertainty of @xmath108 .",
    "this value of @xmath109 has the same variance as the uniform distribution , and the entire @xmath110 range ( plus some marginally unbound orbits ) is contained within the @xmath111 contour , so we will obtain a realistic assessment of the uncertainties .",
    "our procedure for handling the @xmath50 degeneracy is thus :    1 .",
    "fit the orbit with all six parameters free to vary .",
    "if the unconstrained fit yields @xmath112 , then @xmath50 is well constrained by the observations and we are done .",
    "otherwise @xmath50 is essentially decoupled from the observations , so we proceed using the binding constraint instead .",
    "3 .   re - fit the observations but set @xmath95 and derive values and a covariance matrix for the remaining 5 parameters .",
    "note that this best - fit orbit is very similar to the visl orbit , as a line - of - sight velocity near zero implies an orbit near its perihelion or aphelion .",

    "augment the covariance matrix by assigning @xmath113 , placing zeros in the remaining off - diagonal elements .    the best - fit parameters @xmath83 and covariance @xmath114",
    "may then be used to predict positions and orbital elements as in the non - degenerate case .",
    "the @xmath111 error ellipses will encompass @xmath115 of all bound orbits that are consistent with the data , and not be restricted to circular or perihelic orbits .",
    "if we have some preconceptions about the maximal ellipticity of the orbits , this may be incorporated into the position predictions by placing a tighter _ a priori _ constraint on @xmath50 .      with only a single or few nights data , or if there are only 2 observations , we are in the `` slope regime . ''",
    "the above technique will fail due the additional degeneracy between @xmath48 and @xmath45 ( and @xmath49 for observations out of the ecliptic plane ) .",
    "this will manifest itself in the covariance matrix obtained in step  [ p5step ] above , the 5-parameter fit to the orbit .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath116 and/or @xmath117 will be large .",
    "in this case we again introduce the binding constraint to limit the extent of the degeneracy .",
    "we express the transverse kinetic energy in terms of a parameter @xmath118 : @xmath119 the binding constraint is then @xmath120 , with @xmath121 corresponding to a nearly circular orbit .",
    "we crudely implement this constraint by minimizing a new quantity @xmath122 ( with @xmath86 from eq . [ chisq ] ) , which pushes the solution toward a circular orbit , while yielding a covariance matrix that reflects both the observational uncertainties and the possibility of non - circular orbits .",
    "more sophisticated constrained optimizations are possible but there is little point to seeking precise constraints on such a poorly determined orbit .",
    "all of the above algorithms have been implemented in a family of subroutines and drivers written in c. these include routines for : creation and access of binary versions of the de405 ephemeris files ( provided by david hoffman ) ; orbit integration ; transformations among the various cartesian and spherical coordinate systems ; transformations between phase - space and orbital - element bases for orbits ; reduction of positions to topocentric coordinates ; and the fitting procedures described in the previous section .",

    "a fit to 275 mock observations of pluto over a 14-year arc takes about 1 second .",
    "the entire ensemble of observations of all @xmath123 kbos reported to the mpc are fit in a few seconds .",
    "we have verified the performance of the algorithms and software by conducting mock observations of pluto , neptune , and several kbos .",
    "figure  [ plutotest ] shows the results of an ensemble of simulated observations of pluto from 19951998 .",
    "the true position of pluto is obtained from the de405 ephemeris ; mock observations are created at specified dates by adding gaussian deviations to the true positions .",
    "an orbit is then fit to the mock observations .",
    "this fitted orbit is used to estimate the osculating barycentric elements @xmath75 and @xmath76 for pluto as well as the uncertainty ellipse in the @xmath75@xmath76 plane .",
    "alternatively we may use the orbit fit to estimate the @xmath16 sky position of pluto at some future date and its projected error ellipse .",
    "we can then examine whether the estimated orbital elements or future position are consistent with the true ephemeris values . in all cases",
    "we find the mean @xmath86 value of the fit to the orbit to be as expected from the degrees of freedom in the fit .",
    "the first panel in figure  [ plutotest ] shows the results of using 4 observations over an 11-day arc ( jd 24499272449938 ) to predict the location of pluto @xmath123  days after the first observation .",
    "each point on the plot is the prediction from one of 1000 realizations of the mock 11-day arc .",

    "both of these phenomena are expected , however , because the 11-day arc is the `` acceleration regime '' and is degenerate in @xmath50 .",
    "the fits therefore have assumed a value and uncertainty for @xmath50 .",
    "the displacement of the simulations from the true value is due to our assumption that @xmath95 for each fit , which is not the true value .",
    "but the uncertainty ellipse includes a contribution from our ignorance of @xmath50 , which makes the ellipse extend beyond the measured scatter , and in fact properly include the true position .    in the second panel",
    "we simulate an observation sequence consisting of the 11-day arc plus and additional observation at 300 days .",
    "we plot the estimated @xmath75 and @xmath76 values from 1000 mock observations of the 300-day arc . in this case",
    "the uncertainty ellipses give a roughly correct estimate of the size of the errors , but the scatter does not match the error ellipses in detail .",
    "this demonstrates a limitation of our method , which is that the propagation of the covariance matrix @xmath96 to the orbital elements is incorrect if the map between them is significantly nonlinear .",
    "this is the case here , as pluto is very near perihelion at this time .",
    "the 300-day arc determines the distance to pluto quite well , and hence the scatter plot is bounded by a lower limit to the perihelion @xmath125 .",
    "the third panel shows the results of using the 300-day arc to predict the position after 1000 days , and the fourth panel shows the scatter in the @xmath75@xmath76 plane of elements determined from 6 observations on a 1000-day arc .",
    "we can now usefully constrain all 6 parameters of the orbit , and the scatter about the true position and orbit are very accurately described by the estimated covariance matrices .",
    "an optimal schedule for recovery of kbos would maximize some measure of the accuracy of the kbo orbit while minimizing the number of recovery observations required .",
    "a constraint on the observing schedule is that the positional uncertainty must not become larger than the field of view of the instrument , lest the recovery be missed and the object be lost . as an illustration of the utility of the methods described in this paper",
    ", we derive an optimal schedule of observations using a crude algorithm .",
    "we take our measure of the quality of the orbit fit to be the uncertainty @xmath126 in the semi - major axis of the orbit .",
    "this is not meant to be a universal metric for quality but rather a simple example .",
    "we place two constraints on the observing schedule : first , observations are not allowed when the solar elongation of the target is less than 90 .",
    "second , we take the field of view of the recovery instrument to be @xmath127 ; then the 1-sigma positional uncertainty must be @xmath128 if the full 2-sigma error ellipse is to be contained within the field of view for @xmath115 chance of recovery .",

    "a rigourous optimization for a set of @xmath129 observations would consider all possible sets of @xmath129 nights and choose the set which minimizes the final @xmath130 .",
    "we adopt a somewhat simpler `` greedy '' algorithm for optimization as follows : after observation @xmath131 , we consider all nights for which observation @xmath132 would be possible , namely those satisfying the elongation ad positional uncertainty costraints .",
    "we next calculate the @xmath130 which would result from an observation on each possible night ; the @xmath132 observation is then scheduled for the night which would result in minimal @xmath130 .",
    "figure  [ plopt ] illustrates the observation schedule derived for hypothetical discovery of pluto in the year 1995 .",
    "we assume that the object is discovered on a pair of nights roughly 45 days before opposition , then confirmed on another pair of nights 10 days later .",
    "we also presume that each observation has an error of @xmath133 .",
    "as seen in the figure , the object must be observed once again in the discovery season as its uncertainty is too high to be recovered when it emerges from behind the sun the following year .",
    "the object is now sufficiently well characterized to be found for nearly 3 years .",
    "when is the best time during this window to observe again ?",
    "interestingly the accuracy on @xmath75 improves only weakly the longer we wait for our next observation .",
    "the `` greedy '' strategy suggests we wait 3 years , when the positional uncertainty approaches 25 .",
    "so after the initial 4 discovery / confirmation images and only 2 recoveries , @xmath134  au , and the orbit is known well enough to permit recovery for the next decade .",
    "a counterintuitive result is that the timing of further observations has little effect upon the accuracy of @xmath75only increased _ number _ and/or _ accuracy _ of observations matters at this point .",
    "this is because the uncertainty in @xmath75 derives primarily from the uncertainty in @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ the distance to the target",
    ". the leading observable consequence of @xmath45 is the parallax @xmath135 , which does not grow with time beyond 1 year  hence the very weak improvement with longer arcs .",
    "indeed we find that observing near the two quadratures of the second year yields a @xmath130 that is as low as spacing these two observations over several years .",
    "another common observing scheme is to run discovery observations during two nights near opposition , then attempt confirmation one month later . for pluto ,",
    "the positional error is sufficiently small this second month to permit reliable confirmation .",
    "henceforth the optimal strategy plays out just as the previous scenario : a further observation is required before quadrature to keep the object from being lost while behind the sun , and the orbital quality depends primarily upon the number , not the arc length , of recoveries in later years .",
    "if the astrometric accuracy of the initial 11-day arc can be improved to 01 , and the recovery tolerance raised to @xmath136 , then no further observations are required in the first year .",
    "the object is recoverable at the beginning of the second season , two observations ( near the quadratures ) in this second year reduce @xmath130 to 0.0002  au , and the position is good for a decade or more .",
    "these results are of course dependent upon the orbit of the object and upon the nature of one s metric for orbital quality .",
    "our optimization method is , however , easily adapted to other metrics .",
    "orbit fits for kbos and other distant objects are greatly simplified by the fact that the gravitational perturbation to the orbit is small compared both to the inertial motion and to the acceleration of the earth .",
    "gravity can be treated as a perturbation even for decades - long arcs , which simplifies the fitting process and the propagation of errors because there is no need to integrate the derivatives of the orbit .",
    "the orbit itself can be integrated quickly because large time steps can be taken .",
    "distant objects move slowly across the sky , so we can also use the convenience of a tangent - plane projection of the celestial sphere .",
    "the dominance of reflex motion over proper motion means that kbo orbit solutions are unambiguous .    exploiting these properties ,",
    "we have created algorithms and software which quickly and accurately calculates orbital elements and ephemerides _ and their associated uncertainties _ for targets @xmath137  au from the sun . in cases",
    "where the observed arc is short enough to leave the orbit degenerate , we can still calculate sensible positional errors because we have chosen an orbital basis in which the degeneracy is confined to one parameter , namely the line - of - sight velocity .",
    "for very short arcs in the `` slope regime , '' 2 additional parameters become degenerate .",
    "we are still able to place error ellipses on ephemerides which are conservative in the sense that they will include any bound orbit .",
    "most short - arc objects will be recovered closer to the mpc predicted ephemeris than our error ellipses would suggest , because the philosophy of the mpc is to use the stronger _ a priori _ consideration that the orbits resemble those of the majority of the known populations .",
    "our routines should prove valuable for planning of recovery observations , as we have illustrated with some simple examples .",
    "estimates of the uncertainty ellipsoids in orbital - element space will also be needed for study of the long - term dynamics of the known kbos .    in the near future",
    "we expect that kbo positions will be measured to accuracies of a few milli - arcseconds with orbiting observatories  though such observations will be even more expensive than present - day kbo observations .",
    "it will then be possible to place strong constraints on kbo orbits even from very short ( _ e.g. _ 24-hour ) arcs .",
    "for example , the motion of an observatory in low - earth orbit imparts a reflex motion on the kbo that is easily detected at this level , giving a measure of the distance to the target in less than an hour .",
    "the methods described herein will provide the means to plan and to analyze such observations .",
    "we thank david hoffman for making available his c code to read the de405 ephemerides ; brian marsden for discussions on fitting of kbo orbits ; julia plummer for assistance with figure  [ coords ] ; and renu malhotra and lynne allen for serving as `` guinea pigs '' for tests of the software .",
    "this work is supported by nasa planetary astronomy grant # nag5 - 7860 , and grant # ast-9624592 from the national science foundation .",
    "we make use of three sets of coordinates on the celestial sphere : equatorial coordinates @xmath20 in the icrs reference frame , j2000 ; ecliptic latitude and longitude @xmath138 , also taken in the epoch 2000 frame ; and our projected coordinates @xmath16 measured in a tangent plane about some reference direction @xmath24 or @xmath139 . the transformation from equatorial to ecliptic coordinates",
