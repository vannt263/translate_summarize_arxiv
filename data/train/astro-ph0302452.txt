    "psr  b1929@xmath710 is one of the closest and oldest known ordinary pulsars that has been detected in x - rays .",
    "the two latest investigations of this object in x - rays were based on rosat pspc ( yancopoulos  et  al .",
    "1994 , hereafter y94 ) and asca ( wang  &  halpern 1997 , hereafter wh97 ) observations with exposure durations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "y94 obtained , after background subtraction , a total of @xmath10 photons in the 0.1 - 2.0 kev band , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath11 for a source distance of @xmath12 , or @xmath13 of the pulsar s spin - down luminosity .",
    "after folding the barycentered arrival times of the selected events y94 fitted the pulse shape using a sinusoid yielding a pulsed fraction of @xmath14 .",
    "the spectrum was fitted with a black - body with temperature @xmath15 , which indicated that the implied emitting area has a radius of less than @xmath16 .",
    "wh97 used asca data from october 1994 .",
    "the spectrum of psr  b1929@xmath710 over the 0.5 - 5.0  kev range was fitted with a single black - body .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density was not included as a free parameter in the fit .",
    "it was fixed at the level @xmath17 , and the luminosity was calculated for a distance of @xmath18 used by y94 .",
    "their results yield @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the timing analysis",
    "wh97 extracted events from a circle of radius 2.5 arcmin for both gis 2 and 3 and obtained 747 counts within this radius , 413 of which were estimated to belong to the background .",
    "the lightcurve was characterized by a single broad maximum , similar to the rosat soft x - ray profile , with a modulation significance of @xmath21 .",
    "the pulse fraction was estimated to be @xmath22 .",
    "both groups were unable to discriminate conclusively between a thermal and a non - thermal spectrum .",
    "while a black - body is a better overall fit , the inferred emitting area is surprisingly small .    in this study",
    "we revisited the rosat pspc and asca analyses .",
    "moreover , we also included rosat hri data from a combination of 3 observations lasting 346 ks in total , together with data from a 30 ks rxte exposure .",
    "the main goal was to characterize the timing and spectral properties of psr  b1929@xmath710 in more detail using all available x - ray data .",
    "in our study we made use of archival rosat pspc / hri , asca sis / gis and rxte pca data .",
    "an overview of the x - ray observations of psr  b1929@xmath710 is presented in table i.    .x - ray observations of psr  b1929@xmath710 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "point - like x - ray emission was clearly detected in the vicinity of the radio position of the pulsar on the rosat pspc maximum likelihood ratio map ( mlr map , see e.g. kuiper et al .",
    "1998 ) . the number of source and background counts are derived simultaneously by this method . in the timing analysis we extracted events within an optimum radius ( the radius where the signal - to - noise ratio s / n maximizes ) of @xmath23 from the x - ray centroid .",
    "the 604 events ( 0.1 - 2.5 kev ) falling within this radius have subsequently been barycentered and folded through appropriate pulsar parameters ( see e.g. table ii for general characteristics of psr  b1929@xmath710 ) to obtain the pulse - phase distribution shown in left panel of fig .",
    "the profile is characterized by one broad maximum and deviates from a statistically flat distribution at a @xmath24 level when applying a @xmath25 method ( buccheri et al .",
    "due to the limited accuracy of the rosat absolute timing we could not relate the x - ray phase to the radio phase . in order to quantify the pulsed fraction we have applied two methods : one based on bootstrapping ( swanepoel et al .",
    "1996 ) and another based on sinusoid fitting . for broad sinusoidal profiles it is expected that the bootstrap method will systematically underestimate the genuine pulsed fraction because parts of the leading and trailing wings of the broad profile are considered to be part of the interval used to construct the unpulsed level . applying the bootstrap method",
    "we obtain a pulsed fraction , defined as @xmath26 , of @xmath27 .",
    "the number of pulsed counts @xmath28 follows directly from the bootstrap method , while the number of dc counts @xmath29 requires an estimate of the number of background counts within the extraction radius of @xmath23 . from the mlr map",
    "we could estimate that @xmath30 background counts are expected within the extraction radius .",

    "applying sinusoid fitting to the 0.1 - 2.5  kev pspc pulse profile ( see fig .",
    "2 _ left panel _ )",
    "we find a pulse fraction of @xmath43 slightly higher than the bootstrap value , as expected , and consistent with the value found earlier by y94 .    by selecting the events further on energy we applied the same sinusoid fitting method to the 0.1 - 1.28  kev and 1.28 - 2.5  kev pulse profiles .",

    "the obtained pulse profiles for each observation are all of low significance ( between 2 - 3 sigma ) , although the broad bump can be discerned easily .",
    "cross - correlating each of the three hri profiles with the 0.1 - 2.5  kev pspc profile and applying the shifts in the combination of the three separate aligned profiles , yielded a phase distribution which deviates from a flat distribution at the @xmath48 level ( see fig .  2 _ middle panel _ ) . in this case",
    "the sinusoid fitting method yielded a pulsed fraction of @xmath49 , lower but consistent with the pspc value .",
    "the combined rosat pspc and hri profile is shown in the _ right panel _ of fig .  2 and it deviates from being flat at a @xmath50 level .",
    "the pulsed fraction of the combined profile is @xmath51 .",
    "= 4.35 cm = 4.35 cm    = 4.35 cm = 4.35 cm    = 4.35 cm = 4.35 cm      of the two detector systems aboard asca only the gis detectors have sufficient timing resolution to support timing analyses at millisecond scales .",
    "data from the high and medium rate telemetry mode were used .",
    "the 3.9 ms timing resolution valid for these rates was sufficiently high to sample the pulse period of 227 ms ( see table ii ) . in the spatial analysis a maximum likelihood method similar to the one used for the rosat pspc / hri data , provided the optimum position for the x - ray counterpart of psr  b1929@xmath710 .",
    "an extraction radius of @xmath52 from the optimum position was found to optimize the s / n ratio . in the 0.5 - 5  kev energy interval 493",
    "event timetags were barycentered and subsequently folded through appropriate timing parameters to yield the corresponding pulse profile .",
    "this 0.5 - 5  kev profile is shown in fig .",
    "3 _ left panel _ and deviates from uniformity at a @xmath53 level .",
    "the same broad enhancement is visible as in the rosat profiles at softer x - ray energies .",
    "constraining the energy to the 0.5 - 2.0  kev interval , fully overlapping the rosat energy window , yielded a significance of @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "3 _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the pulsed fractions derived from sinusoid fitting for the ( integral ) 0.5 - 5  kev and ( rosat overlapping ) 0.5 - 2.0  kev energy ranges are @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the former value is consistent with the one found by w97 , while the latter value derived for the rosat overlapping interval seems to confirm the increasing trend seen at soft x - ray energies for the pulsed fraction as a function of energy .",
    "= 4.35 cm = 4.35 cm    = 4.35 cm = 4.35 cm      finally , we analysed rxte pca ( 2 - 60  kev ) data from a 30 ks observation of psr b1929@xmath710 ( obs . i d .",
    "20156 ; 21-nov-1997 ) obtained in good xenon mode , time tagging each event with a @xmath57 time resolution .",
    "for the timing analysis we used ftools program fasebin to select events from the top layer of each involved pcu , to barycenter the times of the selected events and finally to fold the barycentered event times with an appropriate ephemeris .",
    "the ephemeris we used in the folding procedure within fasebin is based on radio timing observations of psr  b1929@xmath710 with the 32 m tcfa radio - telescope at toru , poland since the beginning of june 1997 . a dual - channel ,",
    "circular polarization l - band receiving system at frequencies around 1.7  ghz and a 2  x  64  x  3  mhz pulsar back - end , the penn stata pulsar machine  -  2 ( konacki et al . 1999 ) are used . for analyzing the radio pulsar timing data the tempo software package ( _ http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo _ ) has been used .",
    "the folding procedure embedded in fasebin resulted in pulse phase histograms for each of the 256 pha channels . unfortunately , in none of the pha channels or channel intervals significant pulsed emission has been detected .",
    "in the spectral analysis we first derived the number of counts assigned to the x - ray counterpart of psr  b1929@xmath710 in several narrow energy slices using a spatial ( mlr ) analysis which took into account the presence of nearby sources .",
    "we applied this approach to the rosat pspc - b ( 20 energy bins in the interval 0.1 - 2.5  kev ) and asca gis 2 + 3 ( 10 energy bins in the interval 0.5 - 10  kev ) data .",
    "we chose for asca gis data ( contrary to w97 ) because the gis sensitivity is higher than the sis sensitivity for energies beyond @xmath58 and because of uncertainties in the sis efficiency for energies below 1  kev . in the combined rosat pspc - b and asca gis 2",
    "+ 3 spectral fits we used the latest upgrades for the response matrices and we took into account the vignetting corrections for the off - axis ( 3.7 arcmin ) asca observation .",
    "= 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm    the spectral models we fitted to the combined data set consist of a single absorbed power - law , a single absorbed black - body , an absorbed black - body plus power - law and an absorbed double black - body .",
    "the best fits were obtained for a single absorbed power - law ( fig .",
    "4 _ left panel _ ) and an absorbed double black - body model ( fig .  4 _ right panel _ ) .",

    "cooling models predict a surface temperature of the neutron star to be @xmath80 , much too low to be responsible for the observed x - ray spectrum of psr  b1929@xmath710 .",
    "however , a plausible explanation could be that the observed x - ray radiation originates from a heated polar cap characterized by two different thermal components ( see e.g. cheng & zhang 1999 ) .",
    "the  value obtained from the fit is about two times higher than that used by y94 and wh97 .",
    "moreover , the ( non - thermal ) power - law fit resulting in a photon index of @xmath81 yielded an estimate for the neutral hydrogen density towards the source of @xmath82 .",
    "this value is six times larger than the adopted one in earlier works ( y94 , wh97 ) . in both cases the derived column density is consistent with the updated ( radio ) distance determined by brisken et al .",

    "( 1996 ) mentioned , values of  obtained from direct measurements of stars in the neighbourhood of the pulsar are rather controversial .",
    "they differ from @xmath83 up to @xmath84 .",
    "this suggests that interstellar medium is very patchy in that direction .",
    "our revisited analysis of x - ray data of psr 1929@xmath710 from rosat , asca and rxte observations yielded an improved timing signal at soft x - rays , @xmath50 for the combined rosat pspc / hri pulse profile , and a non - detection for energies beyond @xmath85  kev ( rxte pca ) . analyzing the pulse profile at soft x - rays ( rosat pspc ) in two different energy bands suggested that the pulsed fraction increases from @xmath45 in the 0.1  -  1.28  kev band to @xmath46 in the 1.28  -  2.5  kev band ( even @xmath86 for the 0.5  -  2  kev asca gis band ) .",
    "this tendency must stop abruptly near @xmath85 kev to be consistent with the non - detection of pulsed emission above @xmath85  kev .",
    "a spectral analysis of the combined rosat / asca data in the 0.1 - 10  kev energy range indicated that both an absorbed power - law ( non - thermal ) model and an absorbed double black - body model provide an adequate description of the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "the derived hydrogen column density   is in both cases much larger than the value used in previous x - ray studies .",
    "however , the newly determined   values are more consistent with the updated ( increased ) distance to psr  b1929@xmath710 in combination with the measured hydrogen distribution in the direction of the pulsar .",
    "a scheduled observation with the xmm - newton satellite could confirm our results and the much better statistics would help to fix the column density   and to discriminate conclusively between thermal and non - thermal models for the x - ray emission from this pulsar .",
