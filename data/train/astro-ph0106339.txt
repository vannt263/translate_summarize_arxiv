    "the is one of the most important objects in astrophysics . it is a beautiful example of a pulsar powered nebula , and is also the most accessible pulsar nebula .",
    "each generation of observations has revealed new intricacies to its structure .",
    "recent results have highlighted the remarkable nature of the region surrounding the crab nebula s pulsar , where the pulsar wind is injected into the nebula .",
    "a remarkable image of this region from the chandra x - ray observatory ( weisskopf et  al .",
    "2000 ) shows a complex geometry consisting of a tilted toroidal structure with a jet along the symmetry axis of the torus . a recent sequence of images from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) by hester et al .",
    "( 1996 ) revealed astonishing details in this region .",
    "in particular , there is a series of elliptical ripples in this region , which are usually called `` wisps '' .",
    "the wisp region has long been known to be rapidly variable ( lampland 1921 ; scargle 1969 ) , but only recently has the nature of the variability been conclusively established : hester et  al .",
    "( 1996 ; see also hester 1998 ) and tanvir , thomson , & tsikarishvili ( 1997 ) have demonstrated that the wisps are variable on time - scales as short as a few days and that they are moving outwards with apparent speeds of up to @xmath1 .",
    "early chandra results indicate that the x - ray structure is also variable , on timescales of @xmath2  days .    at the center of the crab nebula , and of the wisp region , the rapidly spinning crab pulsar is slowing down , and thus losing energy at the rate of @xmath3  erg  .",
    "this bulk of this energy emerges from the pulsar as a highly collimated wind of relativistic particles and magnetic field .",
    "this outflow is randomized at a shock , where it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings ( rees & gunn 1974 ) and then flows into the body of the nebula , where it gives rise to the synchrotron emission we observe from the body of the nebula .",
    "however , the process by which this transfer of energy happens is not yet well understood ( see e.g.  begelman 1999 ; arons 1998 ; hester 1998 ; chedia et  al .",
    "1997 ) .    since almost all the pulsar s spindown energy is accounted for in the body of the nebula , we know that the transfer of this energy is quite efficient .",
    "only a very small fraction of the energy seems to be radiated directly from the region where the wind is randomized : the wisps are now thought to be associated with the shock which terminates the highly collimated outflow from the pulsar and randomizes it before it enters the body of the nebula .",
    "these features are our only observational window into the process by which the pulsar outflow is converted into the relativistic gas and magnetic field which fill the body of the nebula .",
    "a feature with an arc - like geometry similar to that of the optical wisps was observed in the radio spectral index by bietenholz & kronberg ( 1992 ) , who also observed changes in the radio emission from the center of the nebula over a period of five years .",
    "our goal with these observations is to investigate the nature of the radio synchrotron emission from the wisp region , and to compare it to the synchrotron emission from the optical wisps . in particular",
    ", we will investigate whether the radio wisps are also rapidly variable , since the extant observations of them show only that they are variable on a 5  year timescale .",
    "we observed the crab nebula using the nrao vla in the 5  ghz band .",
    "table  1 shows details of our three observing runs , all of which were done using the vla in the b configuration . due to scheduling reasons , our observing run in february 2000",
    "was split into two segments , which we combined , and we refer to this combined data set as our 11  february 2000 epoch . at each of these sessions , we observed at a spaced pair of frequencies ( within the 5  ghz band ) in order to increase our  coverage , since good  coverage is critical when imaging an object as extended as the crab .",
    "in addition , we chose different pairs of frequencies for the 10  feb .  and the 12  feb .",
    "2000 observing runs , since these two runs had roughly the same range in hour angle .",
    "our primary goal was to investigate any rapid variations in the nebular structure .",
    "since a speed of @xmath4 represents a proper motion of only @xmath5 per month , we do not expect the large scale structure of the nebula to change very much on short timescales .",
    "we do know that the radio synchrotron nebula is expanding at 0.13%  year@xmath6 ( bietenholz et  al .",
    "the effect of this expansion is both predictable , since the rate is known , and is also quite small over the timespan of our observations : the most rapid motion due to the overall expansion rate is @xmath7  yr@xmath6 .",
    "the fact that the large scale structure of the nebula is not expected to change over our timespan is crucial to our strategy : an interferometer like the vla measures the spatial fourier transform of the sky brightness , and is sensitive only to a range of spatial frequencies determined by the length of the interferometer baselines and the observing frequency .",
    "for example , in the b configuration at 5  ghz , the vla is sensitive only to structure on spatial scales between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the crab nebula , however , exhibits structure at spatial scales from @xmath10 down to @xmath11 . typically in such cases",
    ", one would obtain the larger scale structure from vla observations in more compact array configurations .",
    "however , since vla configuration changes occur only once every four months , that approach is not compatible with our goal of obtaining time - resolved observations .",
    "our solution to this problem is to use maximum entropy deconvolution ( aips task vtess ; see cornwell & evans 1985 , cornwell 1988 ) , which allows us to recover the large scale structure by supplying a low resolution support ( default ) in the deconvolution process .",
    "the deconvolved image is then biased to be as close to the support as is allowed by the data .",
    "we chose this support to be the same for all three of our epochs but the effect of this is minimal . ] which serves to make any differences between the epochs be only such as are demanded by the data .",
    "as our support , we used an image of the crab made using data taken in 1987 , at 5  ghz , using the b , c and d configurations of the vla ( bietenholz & kronberg 1990 ; 1991 ) .",
    "we convolved this image with a round gaussian of full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath12 , and scaled it to account for the general expansion of the radio nebula since 1987 . because we have only b  array data at the current epochs of interest , the structure in our images on the largest spatial scales , i.e.  those @xmath13 , is derived predominately from the support image , and we thus have very little information on any changes that might occur at these spatial scales . as we have argued above",
    ", however , there is little reason to expect rapid variations on these scales . on spatial scales smaller than @xmath14 on the other hand ,",
    "our  coverage is excellent , and we believe that our images reliably indicate the structure of the nebula , and in particular , changes therein from one epoch to another .",
    "an image of the crab nebula on 11  february 2000 is shown in figure  [ febmap ] .",
    "the restoring beam size was 14 ( this restoring beam size was conservatively chosen as a common size for all three epochs ) . the background rms level was 76  before applying the primary beam correction , and the peak flux was 46.6  mjy  beam@xmath6 .",
    "this is the highest dynamic range and resolution radio image yet produced of the crab nebula .",
    "we note that it is superior to the three and four - configuration vla images of bietenholz & kronberg ( 1990 ; 1991 )  on which it is partly based through the use of those images as a support  because of our presently increased  coverage at the higher spatial frequencies .",
    "the images taken 1998 august and october were very similar , and so we do not reproduce them in their entirety .",
    "they had background rms levels of 100 and 82  respectively .",
    "instead , we present a _ difference",
    "_   shows the difference between the images of october and august 1998 .",
    "r@ l@ l c c c [ obstab ] 1998 & aug & 9 & 9.6 & 4615 , 4885 & 221.7 + 1998 & oct & 13 & 10.1 & 4615 , 4885 & 286.5 + 2000 & feb & 10 & 3.7 & 4749 , 4996 & 772.1 + 2000 & feb & 12 & 5.7 & 4615 , 4885 & 774.0 + ( combined & feb & 2000 ) & 9.4 & 4615 , 4749 , 4885 , 4996 & 773.1 +    on this difference image a prominent series of elliptical ripples are visible near the center of the nebula .",
    "the brightness of these ripples is several times that of the background noise level .",
    "such ripples are only visible near the pulsar position : figure  [ diffmap ] shows that , in the rest of the nebula , any difference features are of lower amplitude and larger spatial scale , and likely due to noise , missing short - spacings , and errors in the deconvolution .",
    "the elliptical ripples show a remarkable similarity in geometry with the elliptical wisps seen in the optical ( hester et al.1995 ; hester et  al .",
    "1996 ) and the torus visible in the x - ray ( aschenbach & brinkman 1975 ; weisskopf et  al .",
    "figure  [ optdiff ] shows a region near the pulsar of the radio difference image between 1998 october and 2000 february , and a corresponding difference image between two hst images taken 1.5 months apart and convolved to the same resolution ( note that the images in this figure have been rotated by @xmath15 ) .",
    "in particular , the implied inclination angle ( assuming that the features are intrinsically circular ) is similar to that in both the optical and the x - ray . if the ripples were an artefact , such a coincidence in geometry with the real features observed at other wavelengths would be quite unlikely . while moving features seem to exist over roughly the same region in both the optical and radio images , the largest features in the radio are further from the pulsar than the largest optical features are .    in order to make the motions from one epoch to the next better visible in reproductions ,",
    "we show in figure  [ riplmaps ] high - pass filtered views of the center of each of our three images .",
    "we used a gaussian high - pass filter with a fwhm of 25 , which serves to accentuate the relatively faint wisp - like mobile features .",
    "we will call the most mobile feature wisp  @xmath16 , and we indicate its position in 1998 august by a black line on all three images in order to show the displacement in the subsequent epochs .",
    "these motions are real : they occur on spatial scales of a few arc - seconds , exactly those to which we are sensitive and for which we have excellent  coverage . in order to further ascertain that these motions were not some form of artefact due to the deconvolution process",
    ", we performed several tests .",
    "firstly , we deconvolved the 1998 august image using the october image as a support , instead of our usual low - resolution image .",
    "this further biases the images to be as similar as is allowed by the data .",
    "the ripples remained essentially unchanged . secondly , expanding or contracting the default image by 2% also left the ripples unchanged , but resulted in a poorer image .",
    "lastly , we self - calibrated the 1998 august  data both in amplitude and phase , using the october image as a model , and vice versa , and then re - imaged . again",
    ", the ripples are essentially unchanged , implying that they can not be ascribed to any calibration anomalies .    finally , in order measure the speeds of features , we plotted profiles through the high - pass filtered images .",
    "figure [ profls ] shows profiles for our three epochs , drawn through the pulsar at position angles , p.a .",
    ", of @xmath17 , chosen to pass through the most mobile wisp , and at @xmath18 , chosen so as to pass through a mobile feature on the opposite side of the pulsar .",
    "there are numerous changes in addition to the motion of wisp  @xmath16 indicated in fig .",
    "[ riplmaps ] above .",
    "however , with our very coarse sampling in time , the identification of features from one epoch to the next is difficult .",
    "we note that the pulsar , which is known to be quite variable but has a mean flux density of 1.4  mjy at 4.8  ghz ( lorimer et  al .",
    "1995 ) , is visible as a variable peak at the origin in the profiles .",
    "the identification is wisp @xmath16 between 1998 august and october is unambiguous .",
    "it moves with an apparent velocity of @xmath19 .",
    "we indicate this motion with a solid line on fig .",
    "[ profls]@xmath16 . by 2000",
    "february  11 , the identification is no longer completely unambiguous  we mark the motion derived from the likeliest identification in fig .  [ profls]@xmath16 with a dashed line .",
    "this identification implies an average apparent speed between 1998  august and 2000  february of @xmath20 , which is consistent with the speed between 1998 august and october . on the opposite side of the pulsar",
    ", the most prominent moving feature is seen on the profile at p.a .",
    "we call this feature the counter - wisp , and mark its motion in fig .",
    "[ profls]@xmath22 .",
    "the speed between 2000 august and october is not reliably determinable , but the apparent speed between 1998 ( taking the average of august and october ) and 2000 february is @xmath23 , and this motion marked in fig .",
    "[ profls]@xmath22 .",
    "we note that because of the large time interval and the complexity of the changes between our 1998 and 2000 epochs , the identification of features over this time - span is necessarily somewhat more tentative .    assuming an inclination angle of 30",
    ", we can calculate the true speed of the features above : wisp  @xmath16 has a true speed of @xmath24 , ( assuming that the above identification in feb .",
    "2000 is correct ; see fig .",
    "[ profls]@xmath16 ) .",
    "the counter - wisp has a true speed of @xmath25 .",
    "we have shown that there are rapidly moving features , with velocities @xmath26 , visible in the radio emission from the crab nebula .",
    "these features have an arc - like geometry similar to that of the optical wisps .",
    "bietenholz & kronberg ( 1992 ) had already reported the existence of similarly shaped features near the center of the nebula , apparent in the radio spectral index .",
    "they noted the possibility that these features might in fact be temporal changes rather than true spectral index features , because the two images from which they derived the spectral index were effectively taken several months apart . in light of the present results it seems likely that the features reported in bietenholz & kronberg ( 1992 ) were in fact the result of temporal changes , rather than true spectral index anomalies .",
    "we can not of course exclude the presence of true spectral index variations , but the data so far at hand do not demand them .",
    "we propose that these rapidly variable radio wisps are associated with the similar features seen in the optical and the torus visible in the x - ray .",
    "the precise geometry of the radio features is harder to discern than that of the optical wisps due to the presence of a relatively much brighter complex background provided by the rest of the nebula .",
    "nonetheless our difference images give a distinct picture of the temporal changes in these features , and clearly show an elliptical geometry .",
    "in fact , the ellipticity is the same as that of both the optical wisps and the x - ray torus , suggesting that , like the optical wisps and the x - ray torus , the radio wisps are circular features seen at the same inclination angle of @xmath27 .",
    "like the optical wisps , the radio wisps seem to be moving outward ( although this is not clearly established by our observations , since we have only three epochs and sub - optimal time sampling , the unambiguously identified wisp  @xmath16 _ is _ moving outwards between august and october 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , we measure speeds of @xmath28 for the features which we can identify from one epoch to the next .",
    "this is in fact the expected speed for the post - shock flow ( blandford & rees 1974 ) and consistent with the speeds measured in the optical ( hester et  al .",
    "1996 ; hester 1998 ; tanvir et  al .",
    "1997 ) and inferred from the x - ray ( pelling et  al .",
    "these arguments strongly suggest that the presently observed radio wisps are associated with the optical wisps and the x - ray torus .    in order to discuss the implications of these observations",
    ", we will briefly describe our theoretical understanding of the crab nebula . as mentioned in   1 , the visible synchrotron nebula is powered by the spindown energy of pulsar .",
    "this energy emerges from the pulsar in the form of a collimated , highly relativistic wind , which consists of some combination of particles and magnetic field .",
    "the coupling to the outer boundary condition , namely the outside of the observable synchrotron nebula which moves with @xmath29 , requires a shock in the wind .",
    "it is at this shock that the particle velocities are randomized , and it is the post - shock wind which then supplies the relativistic particles and the magnetic field responsible for the nebular synchrotron emission .",
    "the wisps are thought to be manifestations of this termination shock , since pressure balance arguments place the location of the shock roughly at the wisp location ( rees & gunn 1974 ) .",
    "similar features have been seen near other pulsars ( bietenholz , frail , & hankins 1991 ; frail & moffett 1993 ) , and so they may be a common manifestation of the interaction of a pulsar wind with its surroundings . in particular , the wisps are thought to be associated with the shock in the equatorial sector of the pulsar wind , since both the optical and especially the x - ray observations ( weisskopf et  al .",
    "2000 ) clearly show a toroidal geometry .",
    "( we note that polar features are also seen in both the optical and the x - ray , but as yet we can not conclusively identify any polar features in the radio ) .    the precise mechanism of wisp formation ,",
    "however , is not yet well understood ( bietenholz & kronberg 1992 ; chedia et  al .",
    "1997 ; hester 1998 ; arons 1998 ; begelman 1999 ) . also , while the radio spectral index is very uniform over the nebula ( bietenholz et al .",
    "1997 ) , suggesting a single and presumably central source for all the radio emitting electrons , their origin in the shock near the pulsar is not yet understood ( see e.g. , atoyan 1999 ; arons 1998 ) . at the termination shock of the wind",
    ", one expects that the mean lorentz factor , @xmath30 , of the post - shock particles to be roughly equal to that in the wind , which is widely thought to be @xmath31 ( rees & gunn 1974 ; kennel & coroniti 1984 ; melatos & melrose 1996 ; arons , 1998 ) .",
    "however , this would produce essentially no radio - emitting , i.e.  @xmath32 electrons .",
    "for example , the model of arons ( 1998 ; see also gallant & arons 1994 ) can account for wisps and also the observed nebular spectrum from the optical to the x - ray , but it can not account for the radio - emitting electrons .",
    "arons suggests that a slower , high - latitude wind might produce the radio emitting electrons . in the model of atoyan ( 1999 ) , which can account for the entire nebular spectrum ,",
    "the radio emitting electrons are of historical origin , having been emitted when the pulsar was younger and spinning much more rapidly .",
    "however , in neither of these cases would radio - emitting electrons be accelerated in the current wisp region .",
    "thus the detection of wisps in the radio implies that the acceleration of particles in the equatorial shock termination region produces low energy radio - emitting electrons as well as those at higher energies responsible for the optical and higher synchrotron emission .    in summary",
    ", we present new radio images of the crab nebula , with higher resolution and dynamic range than those previously available .",
    "we show that there are significant changes occurring over periods of two months and one year .",
    "an arc - like feature , or wisp , is seen to be moving outwards , and images of the _ differences _ between successive pairs of our three observing epochs clearly show numerous features which have an elliptical geometry .",
    "we propose that these radio wisps are associated with the optical wisps , which suggests that acceleration mechanism producing radio - emitting electrons is the same as , or at least co - spatial to , that producing the more energetic electrons responsible for the nebular optical and x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "future , more highly time - resolved observations will hopefully allow us to establish the exact nature and speed of the motions .",
