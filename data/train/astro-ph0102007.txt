    "the gamma - ray satellite integral will be operated as an observatory whith the majority of scientific observing time being awarded to the scientific community at large , following standard ao and peer - review procedures : this constitutes the general programme covering open time observations . as a return to those scientific collaborations and individual scientists who contributed to the development , design and procurement of integral and who are represented in the integral science working team ( iswt )",
    ", a portion of the total scientific observing time , the guaranteed time , will be used for their core programme observations ( figure  [ cw : programme ] ) .",
    ".core programme elements and allocated observing time during first year of operations . [ cols=\"^,<,^ \" , ]     [ cw : sens ]    in figure  [ cw : sim ] we show ibis simulation results of one gps scan across the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "several known sources can be easily detected at levels above 10@xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , simulation of a 1 crab transient results in a 90% error radius less than 10 arcseconds providing accurate data for optical / radio follow - up observations .",
    "finally , a faint source ( 30 mcrab ) located in a crowded region would be detected at the 6@xmath3 level .",
    "supernovae and novae observations would be possibly done repeatedly at various times after onset , to study , for example , early observations of radioactivity from co breaking through the sn envelope and late observations of @xmath4ti .",
    "the typical total exposure would amount to @xmath0 1 - 2 @xmath110@xmath5 s.      these sources also require a number of repeated observations after alert on intervals ranging from days to weeks . typical total exposure per source would amount to @xmath0 3@xmath110@xmath6 s with an ibis sensitivity of @xmath09@xmath110@xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath9 kev@xmath9 ( 0.07 mcrab ) at 100 kev .",
    "these observations will be triggered if the source deviates significantly from a ",
    "normal  intensity level .",
    "these would be , for example for grs1915@xmath10105 , a flux exceeding 500 mcrab @ 10 kev , or 300 mcrab @ 100 kev for gro  j1655 , easily detectable by a single gps exposure .",
    "studies of points sources and nucleosynthesis studies of the vela regions require typically @xmath010@xmath5 s. the continuum sensitivities ( 3@xmath3 ) obtainable during that observation in the 100 kev to 1 mev range would be 2@xmath110@xmath11 to 1.5@xmath110@xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath9 kev@xmath9 ( spi ) and ( 5 to 6)@xmath110@xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath9 kev@xmath9 ( ibis ) while jem - x would achieve @xmath07@xmath110@xmath11 @xmath8 s@xmath9 kev@xmath9 in the 3 to 30 kev range . for line studies spi will achieve a 3@xmath3 sensitivity of @xmath07@xmath110@xmath11 @xmath8 s@xmath9 in the 100 kev to 2 mev region .",
    "data from the core programme will be used by the iswt as a common scientific database .",
    "this database will be analysed according to research categories ( e.g. diffuse galactic emission ) and topics ( e.g. 511 kev line profiles ) .",
    "the topics / scientists involved in that research do match the agreed share of core programme data within the iswt .",
    "the data are property of the iswt for the duration of one year",
    ". then they will become publicly available through the archive .",
    "the same rules do apply for data obtained during the open time ( general programme ) .",
    "the specification of the known and unknown transients ( see above ) serves the purpose to clearly notify the scientific community at large on the cp guaranteed targets .",
    "note , however , that due to the random nature of transient events and the limited amount of cp allocated time , it is possible that not all pointed too follow - up observations will be performed within the cp allocated time . therefore open",
    "time proposals for any of those too sources as listed above are not a priori prohibited and should differ in scientific objectives and instrument modes but run a smaller chance of being executed than any open time too proposals made for transient events not listed in the cp . the vela region is reserved as a guarenteed time target .    in case too follow - up observations will be performed for ( exciting ) scientific reasons , and the required time would exceed the total allocated ceiling , and no open time proposals would exist , then these observations would be performed , but the data would be made publicly available immediately . however , the iswt will keep some flexibility in the allocation of its cp time in case a major too event ( e.g. close - by sn ) would occur and not sufficient time would be available anymore . in this case",
    "the iswt will review the cp priorities and , if available , re - assign gcde and gps time for this follow - up observation . in case of low too activity ,",
    "more time could be spend on the vela region observation .",
    "the integral core programme has been defined by the core programme working group ( n. gehrels , n. lund , p. ubertini , v. schnfelder , c. winkler ) who has been charged by the iswt with this task . the fundamental support of the instrument teams , in particular through extensive simulation studies , and of the integral mission scientists is gratefully acknowledged .",
