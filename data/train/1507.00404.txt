    "<S> several kinds of estimations of the exciton binding energy in ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> the first method was employed by hirasawa et al@xcite , and repeated later with improved accuracy by tanaka et al@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they measured the exciton diamagnetic coefficient in magneto - absorption spectra , and related the measurements with the binding energy in the framework of the hydrogenic model with the high frequency dielectric constant . with this model , </S>",
    "<S> tanaka et al determined a binding energy of 50 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the high frequency dielectric constants was a choice of the model , and not determined by the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that tanaka et al , and hirasawa et al used a value @xmath17 that is higher than our value . </S>",
    "<S> if our value @xmath115 were used , a binding energy of 65 mev would be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , our binding energies using the larger dielectric constant would be smaller . </S>",
    "<S> these values of the exciton binding energy are strongly biased by the choice of the dielectric constants .    </S>",
    "<S> the second method has been applied by sun et al@xcite ( @xmath116  mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> they obtained the binding energy by fitting the photoluminescence intensity as a function of temperature with an arrhenius equation , not using any model of the exciton states . </S>",
    "<S> it is rewarding that our calculation of the binding energy is in good agreement with the values determined by sun et al . </S>",
    "<S> huang and lambrecht@xcite have argued , in a study of cesium tin halide perovskites , that the photoluminescence temperature dependence just give information on the free exciton linewidth or the binding energies of bound excitons , but not on free excitons . </S>",
    "<S> however , even et al@xcite fitted the absorption spectrum using the wannier - mott exciton model and obtained a similar value for the binding energy , and reported an effective dielectric constant @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this value of the dielectric constants , together with the assumed reduced mass @xmath117@xcite means a binding energy of 19 mev . </S>",
    "<S> another method independent of the dielectric function has been used by miyata et al@xcite , who performed magneto - absorption experiments with very high magnetic fields , determining a value of @xmath118  ev . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that miyata et al were able to detect the @xmath119 exciton state for high magnetic field and extrapolated a @xmath120 difference of 15 mev at low magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth , assuming the hydrogenic model , they estimated the binding energy in @xmath121 mev . </S>",
    "<S> however , extrapolating the landau levels of the free exciton spectrum they obtained the precise value of @xmath122 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this observation agrees with our result that the @xmath119 state is within @xmath123  mev of the free exciton edge .    </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation of the oscillator strength provides another argument against the model of hydrogenic wannier excitons screened by @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> ishihara@xcite reported an experimental values of 0.02 , which is close to our value 0.013 . if the ground exciton were well described by hidrogenic model with @xmath13 , then @xmath124 ( compare with table [ tab : en ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : os ] ) , and the oscillator strength would be @xmath125 times smaller . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at least for low temperature , the fundamental exciton state does not correspond to screening by @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to stress that we have not fitted any parameter in this work , which would bring the exciton binding energies in closer agreement with the recent experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters with larger uncertainty are the dielectric constants and the lo phonon energy . </S>",
    "<S> the only available experimental value of @xmath17@xcite is larger than the ab initio value used here and that value would reduce the calculated binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath11 is rather old , with few published details , and a new determination for present - day thin films would be welcomed . </S>",
    "<S> the lo phonon energy @xmath20 has been chosen from the more prominent peak in the calculated raman spectrum of ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0@xcite , which is close to lo phonon energies in ii - vi and iii - v semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the model hamiltonians were developed assuming a unique lo phonon energy . </S>",
    "<S> the raman spectrum of ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 shows bands at lower wave numbers . </S>",
    "<S> using and average energy of the raman active peaks , which do not have necessarily lo character , may lead to lower exciton binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of the pb hamiltonian to include several lo phonon branches would be a better founded approach .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the exciton binding energies and oscillator strengths using two model hamiltonians of the exciton - phonon coupled system . </S>",
    "<S> the pollmann - bttner model hamiltonian gives a binding energy in good agreement with recent experimental determinations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated oscillator strength of the main exciton line agrees with the value estimated from experiments , while the strengths of higher transitions are much smaller .    </S>",
