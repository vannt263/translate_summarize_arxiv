    "the method of cosmic crystallography ( cc ) , devised by lehoucq et al .",
    "@xcite , looks for distance correlations between cosmic sources using pair separations histograms ( psh ) , i.e. plots of the number of pairs of sources versus the distance ( or squared distance ) between them .",
    "these correlations arise from the isometries of the covering group of the 3-manifold used to model our universe and so they provide a signature of its global spatial topology . in this way",
    "cc is potentially useful to investigate the shape and size of our universe .",
    "it has recently been shown by gomero et al .",
    "@xcite how to calculate the topological signature from these distance correlations in a very general geometrical - topological - observational setting .",
    "it turns out from the major result of ref .",
    "@xcite that correlations due to clifford translations manifest as spikes in psh s , whereas other isometries manifest as small deformations of the _ expected _ pair separations histogram ( epsh ) of the corresponding universal covering manifold .",
    "the major result of ref.@xcite has a striking consequence for universe models with hyperbolic spatial sections",
    ". indeed , since no hyperbolic isometry is a clifford translation , there are no topological spikes in psh s corresponding to low density universe models .",
    "thus , at first sight , these histograms seem to give no reliable information of the topology of the spatial sections in these models of the universe .",
    "the absence of spikes in psh s from hyperbolic universes is by now well understood and has been confirmed by simulations performed by lehoucq et al .",
    "@xcite and fagundes and gausmann @xcite .",
    "it remains , however , to understand the topological signature of hyperbolic isometries in cc .",
    "the implications of the results of ref.@xcite for psh s from flat universe models seem to be less well understood .",
    "it has been stated in @xcite and @xcite that every euclidean isometry which produces @xmath0-pairs in a given catalog will give rise to a spike in the corresponding psh .",
    "this statement , however , is in clear contradiction with the fact that only translations produce spikes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in studying the applicability of cc to closed flat models of our universe , fagundes and gausmann @xcite reported a psh for a manifold of class @xmath1 , therein called model @xmath2 , which exhibits a significant peak at @xmath3 .",
    "that paper suggests that this spike is generated by an isometry of the covering group of the manifold considered , and this interpretation was again suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , according to ref.@xcite , since there is no translation that would produce the peak at @xmath3 , one immediately concludes that it must be due to statistical fluctuations , and so it is not of topological origin .",
    "a definitive elucidation of these unsettled issues would be useful because it would clarify the actual signature of euclidean non - translational isometries in psh s .",
    "indeed , by performing simulations we will evince in this letter that , contrary to what is suggested in @xcite and @xcite , topological spikes are not the only signature of topology in psh s corresponding to euclidean small universes .",
    "besides we also show through simulations that non - translational isometries do not manifest as _ less sharp peaks _ as suggested by fagundes and gausmann @xcite , but as broad and tiny deformations of the psh corresponding to the simply connected case .",
    "our results here are supported by and in agreement with the general theoretical developments of ref.@xcite .    actually , the major purpose of this letter is to show how to use the mpsh technique described in @xcite for studying the topological signature of isometries in psh s . after a brief review of the techniques developed in @xcite",
    "we first compute mpsh s for a manifold @xmath4 of class @xmath1 and reduce the statistical noise to a level that allows the identification of topological spikes . in this way ( i ) statistical spikes that may be confused with topological spikes are removed , and ( ii ) topological spikes that are masked by statistical fluctuations in individual psh s show up even when there are few @xmath0-pairs corresponding to them .",
    "incidentally , point ( i ) makes clear that actually there is no topological spike at @xmath3 . as an additional application we construct an epsh for the minimal 3-torus that covers @xmath4 and plot the difference between this epsh and an mpsh of @xmath4 . since the covering groups of this 3-torus and that of @xmath4 have the same translations , then psh s for these two manifolds would exhibit identical spike spectra @xcite .",
    "so this difference yields the topological signature of non - translational isometries of the covering group of @xmath4 plus some statistical noise . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the difference between an mpsh and an epsh , both for the 3-torus , obtaining as a result essentially statistical noise .",
    "this indicates that , within the accuracy of the simulations , topological spikes are the only topological signature in psh s for a 3-torus .",
    "here we briefly review some results obtained in ref.@xcite , and extend them to the level needed for the development of this work .",
    "we begin by describing what a pair separations histogram ( psh ) is , and then show how to construct mean pair separations histograms ( mpsh ) with simulated catalogs .",
    "we end with a brief explanation of the expected pair separations histogram ( epsh ) and its use in determining the topological signature for non - translational isometries .    to build a psh we simply evaluate a suitable one - to - one function @xmath5 of the separation @xmath6 of every pair of cosmic sources from a given catalog @xmath7 , and then count the number of pairs for which these values @xmath8 lie within certain subintervals .",
    "these subintervals are all of equal length and must form a partition of the interval @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the diameter of the observed universe corresponding to the catalog .",
    "a psh is just a normalized plot of this counting .",
    "we will take the function @xmath5 to be the square function as is usual when dealing with flat models in cc , in order to compare our plots with those found in the literature .",
    "it is convenient to have a formal description of the above procedure . in considering discrete astrophysical sources ,",
    "the _ observable universe _ can be viewed as that part of the universal covering manifold @xmath11 of the space - like section @xmath4 of spacetime , causally connected to an image of our position since the moment of matter - radiation decoupling ; while , given a catalog of cosmic sources , the _ observed universe _",
    "@xmath12 is that part of the observable universe which contains all the sources listed in the catalog .",
    "so , for instance , the observed universe corresponding to a catalog covering the entire sky is a ball of radius given by the redshift cutoff of the catalog , while for a pencil beam catalog it is a thin cone with vertex at an image of our position .",
    "interesting observed universes that may be explored in the context of cc are thin spherical shells ; these observed universes correspond to catalogs with approximately equal upper and lower redshift cutoffs @xcite .",
    "all the sources contained in @xmath12 can be observed in principle , but due to observational limitations a catalog consists only of part of them .",
    "our observational limitations can be formulated as _ selection rules _ which describe how the catalog arises from the set of observable images .",
    "these selection rules , together with the distribution law which the objects in @xmath4 obey , will be referred to as _ construction rules _ for the catalog @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that the above definition for a catalog fits in with the two basic types of catalogs one usually finds in practice , namely real catalogs ( which arise from observations ) and simulated catalogs , which are generated under well - defined assumptions that are posed to mimic some observational limitations and ( or ) to account for simplifying hypotheses .    to construct a psh",
    "one begins by dividing the interval @xmath13 $ ] in @xmath14 equal subintervals of length @xmath15 .",
    "each subinterval has the form @xmath16 \\qquad ; \\qquad i=1,2 , \\dots , m \\ ; , \\ ] ] and is centered at @xmath17 given a catalog @xmath7 of cosmic sources and denoting by @xmath18 the number of pairs of sources in @xmath7 with squared separation @xmath19 , a psh is then obtained plotting the function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of sources in @xmath7 . note that with the same catalog @xmath7 we may obtain different psh s simply by taking different values for @xmath14 .",
    "the sum in  ( [ histograma ] ) is just a counting and the coefficient of the sum is a normalization constant , so @xmath22 although it is usual in cc to refer to the plot of the function @xmath23 as a psh , for theoretical purposes it is more useful to define a psh as a function given by ( [ histograma ] ) . from now on we will always refer to @xmath23 simply as a psh .    any single psh is plagued with statistical noise that may mask the topological signature . the simplest and most obvious way to reduce this noise is to use the mpsh which is described as follows . consider @xmath24 comparable catalogs @xmath25",
    "( @xmath26 ) , with approximately the same number of cosmic sources and corresponding to the same manifold @xmath4 .",
    "let their psh s , for a fixed value of @xmath14 , be given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of sources in @xmath25 and @xmath29 is the number of pairs of sources in @xmath25 with squared separation @xmath19 ; then , the mpsh defined by @xmath30 contains much less noise than any single psh , and clearly contains the same topological information .",
    "indeed , elementary statistics tells us that the statistical fluctuations in the mpsh are reduced by a factor proportional to @xmath31 , which makes at first sight the mpsh very attractive . in sec.[spikes ] we apply this technique to discriminate between topological and statistical spikes in psh s corresponding to an euclidean compact manifold .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in the limit @xmath32 the mpsh approximates very well to the epsh which is an `` ideal '' psh , i.e. a psh with the statistical noise completely removed .",
    "equation  ( 4.15 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite [ or equivalently eq .  ( 2.11 ) rederived in ref .",
    "@xcite , wherein @xmath33 denotes the total number of pairs of cosmic images ] can be rewritten in the form @xmath34   + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\,\\sum_{g \\in \\widetilde{\\gamma } } \\nu_g\\ , [ \\ , \\phi^g_{exp}\\,(s_i ) - \\phi^{sc}_{exp}\\,(s_i)\\ , ] \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the covering group @xmath0 of @xmath4 without the identity element , @xmath21 is the mean value of the @xmath28 , @xmath36 is the epsh of the corresponding simply connected case , @xmath37 is the expected number of uncorrelated pairs and @xmath38 . in",
    "( [ topsig1 ] ) @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the probability of an uncorrelated pair to be separated by a squared distance that lies in @xmath41 . for each covering isometry",
    "it is also defined a number @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the expected number of @xmath44-pairs in a catalog with @xmath21 sources , and a distribution function @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the probability of an observed @xmath44-pair to be separated by a squared distance that lies in @xmath41 .",
    "now within the approximation @xmath47 the epsh reads @xmath48 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the general underlying setting for performing the calculations involved in ( [ epsh ] ) is the assumed existence of an ensemble of catalogs comparable to a given catalog @xmath7 ( real or simulated ) , with the same number of sources and corresponding to the same manifold @xmath4 .",
    "the construction rules permit the computation of probabilities and expected values involved in ( [ epsh ] ) .",
    "let @xmath49 be the subset of all clifford translations of @xmath0 ( i.e. all the isometries @xmath50 such that for all @xmath51 , the distance @xmath52 is independent of @xmath53 ) . when @xmath54 we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath57 is the position of the spike due to the translation @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath58",
    ". then one can write ( [ epsh ] ) as @xmath59 where @xmath60\\ ] ] is the contribution of clifford translations to the topological signature of the epsh , and @xmath61\\ ] ] is the topological signature associated to the non - translational isometries of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ epsh2 ] ) that manifolds with the same translations in their covering groups will exhibit the same spike spectra given by ( [ transepsh ] ) , the only difference between their epsh s being the topological signature associated to non - translational isometries .",
    "moreover , in the euclidean case , from ( [ epsh2 ] ) one can always write @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the epsh of the minimal 3-torus that covers @xmath4 .",
    "now , using the fact that @xmath64 one gets another approximate expression for the topological signature of non - translational isometries of small flat universes , namely @xmath65 this expression can easily be numerically evaluated since the mpsh can be obtained with computer simulations , and @xmath66 is given explicitly by @xmath67 in sec.[topsig ] we use ( [ ntepsh3 ] ) and ( [ torusepsh2 ] ) to evince the shape of the topological signature of non - translational isometries for an euclidean closed manifold .    from now on we will consider only trivial construction rules , i.e. we will assume that cosmic sources are uniformly distributed in space , and all cosmic sources present in universe models , up to a given redshift , are recorded in catalogs .",
    "although unrealistic , this assumption makes easy to illustrate the general results developed in ref.@xcite and permits a comparison with current literature in cc . besides , in this case we can readily compute @xmath68 and the coefficients @xmath69 .    indeed , from ref.@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) one can easily calculate @xmath68 for the case of trivial construction rules and a ball of radius @xmath70 as an observed universe . for flat models one obtains @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the heaviside function . correspondingly , the coefficients @xmath69 can be calculated by simple geometrical arguments .",
    "indeed , let @xmath73 be the observed universe , i.e. a ball of radius @xmath70 centered at our position .",
    "the isometry @xmath44 transforms isometrically the ball @xmath74 into the ball @xmath73 , so only the sources in @xmath75 have a @xmath44-partner in @xmath73 , and form @xmath44-pairs .",
    "thus we have @xmath76 a simple calculation yields @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the distance from the center of the observed universe to its image by the isometry @xmath44 .",
    "let us now show how to use the mpsh technique to discriminate between topological and statistical spikes by working out two examples of models of the universe reported in ref.@xcite . in order to make a comparison with the plots of the upper part of fig.1 in ref.@xcite , we took a manifold @xmath4 of type @xmath1 with covering group @xmath0 generated by @xmath79 where @xmath80 . a fundamental polyhedron for @xmath4 and a detailed construction of this manifold",
    "is given in ref.@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have performed simulations for two observed universes with radii @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . as in ref.@xcite , for each simulation in the first case ( @xmath81 ) we put 20 objects uniformly distributed in the fp , while in the case @xmath82 we put 101 objects inside it . in both cases we end up with catalogs of approximately 240 sources .",
    "a psh for one catalog for each case is shown in fig.1 , where we have subdivided the intervals @xmath83 $ ] in bins of width 0.01 as in ref.@xcite .",
    "a direct comparison with the plots in ref.@xcite can be done by considering unit lengths of @xmath84 for the first case and @xmath85 for the second .",
    "an important difference between our plots and those in ref.@xcite is that ours are normalized histograms as described in sec.[histog ] .",
    "we can see that the psh in fig.1a presents no apparent spike at @xmath86 , suggesting that the corresponding spike in ref.@xcite is of statistical origin . in order to elucidate this and related issues",
    "we shall now discuss the mpsh s corresponding to these psh s .",
    "figure 2 shows one mpsh built with 50 computer generated comparable catalogs with approximately 240 sources for each case of study .",
    "it can be seen that , by taking the mean over 50 catalogs , the statistical noise has been considerably reduced .",
    "moreover it became apparent from such plots that there is no topological spike at @xmath86 for the first model of the universe , whereas for the second there is a small spike at @xmath87 that is masked by statistical fluctuations in the individual psh s of fig.1b of this work and fig.1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "both mpsh s show the agreement between our simulations and the theoretical results of @xcite . besides , it can be shown that there are no topological spikes at any odd integer position in psh s corresponding to models of the universe which have @xmath4 as spatial sections of spacetime ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "let us now consider the group @xmath88 generated by the translations @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this group is formed by all the translations in @xmath0 and is the covering group of the minimal 3-torus that covers @xmath4 .",
    "a fundamental polyhedron for this 3-torus is a parallelepiped of height 2 and square base of side @xmath92 . as it has been shown in sec.[histog ] , psh s corresponding to models of the universe that have the same translations in their covering groups exhibit the same spike spectra of topological origin .",
    "this result is illustrated in fig.3 where it is shown a psh , and an mpsh computed with 50 simulated catalogs in this 3-torus .",
    "all catalogs used here are comparable to those used in the simulations performed in sec.[spikes ] for an observed universe of radius @xmath93 , and have approximately 240 sources .",
    "we can note that there is no relevant difference between plots corresponding to @xmath4 and its minimal covering 3-torus even after reducing the noise by calculating the mean over 50 catalogs .",
    "thus , looking at any of these plots one can not say whether it comes from a catalog of sources in a @xmath1 universe or in its 3-torus minimal covering : topological spikes are not enough to distinguish between these two flat manifolds because they have the same set of clifford translations in their covering groups .",
    "to evince the topological signature of non - translational isometries of @xmath4 in cc , and so be able to distinguish between @xmath4 and any other manifold , we make use of ( [ ntepsh3 ] ) and ( [ torusepsh2 ] ) .",
    "fig.4 shows the graph of @xmath66 given by eq.([torusepsh2 ] ) together with  ( [ scepsh ] ) for the case of an observed universe of radius @xmath81 .",
    "the comparison between the epsh of fig.4 and the mpsh shown in fig.3b makes apparent the strength of the mpsh procedure . in both fig.4 and fig.5",
    "we have reduced the number of sources from 240 to 120 to enhance the amplitude of the topological signature . in these figures",
    "we have also incremented the width of the bins from 0.01 to 0.02 just to keep the amplitude of the spikes as in the previous simulations . figs.5a and 5b are plots of eq.([ntepsh3 ] ) .",
    "the first plot corresponds to eq.([ntepsh3 ] ) with an mpsh , @xmath94 , for the 3-torus while the second corresponds to eq.([ntepsh3 ] ) with an mpsh for @xmath4 .",
    "both mpsh s were built with 5000 catalogs . since the covering groups of this 3-torus and that of @xmath4 have the same translations , psh s for these two manifolds would exhibit identical spike spectra ; so the differences given by eq.([ntepsh3 ] ) yield the topological signature of eventual non - translational isometries plus some statistical noise .",
    "fig.5a is essentially noise , as expected , since there are no non - translational isometries in the covering group of the 3-torus ; while fig.5b evinces the topological signature of non - translational isometries of @xmath0 ( the covering group of @xmath4 ) . in fig.5b ,",
    "the amplitude of the topological signature of non - translational isometries is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the amplitude and the statistical noise of the psh s in fig.1 , so this signature could hardly be eventually extracted from a single psh constructed with a real catalog .",
    "we have been able to evince this tiny topological signature in our simulations because we have succeeded in reducing the statistical noise by two orders of magnitude using the mpsh technique . incidentally ,",
    "if there is any other component to the topological signature in psh s of 3-tori ( i.e. other than spikes ) , its amplitude must be at least three orders of magnitude smaller than that of a psh , as shown in fig.5a .",
    "one can obtain a better understanding of the structural features exhibited in fig.5b , in particular the exact locations of the `` jumps '' , by noting that , since @xmath0 acts freely and discontinuously on euclidean space , there is a minimum non - null pair separation @xmath95 among all @xmath44-pairs , for each @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the terms @xmath97 , which appear in the definition  ( [ ntepsh ] ) of the topological signature of non - translational isometries , are zero until the @xmath98-th bin given by the condition @xmath99 . as reported in  @xcite ( see fig.2a and fig.2b therein ) ,",
    "these terms start with a jump at this @xmath98-th bin , therefore one expects that the topological signature of non - translational isometries presents such jumps at well defined positions that we will calculate in what follows .",
    "note that all non - translational isometries of @xmath0 can be grouped in the following three categories according to whether the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath14 are even ( e ) or odd ( o ) ( see appendix a )    type oe : :    @xmath101 and @xmath102 , type eo : :    @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and type oo : :    @xmath101 and @xmath104 ,    where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are integers .",
    "straightforward calculations yield @xmath107 and @xmath108 are given by equation  ( [ canon ] ) .",
    "now it can easily be seen that the non - translational contributions to the topological signature sharply start at @xmath109 ( see table  [ jumps ] for clarification ) .",
    "an observable universe for a full sky covering survey and radius @xmath93 allows non - null contributions from non - translational isometries with @xmath110 , and so its topological signature must present `` jumps '' at @xmath111 and @xmath112 only , in agreement with fig.5b .    *",

    "note however that the ultimate step in most of such statistical approaches to extract the topological signature is the comparison of the graphs ( signature ) obtained from simulated catalogs against similar graphs generated from real catalogs .",
    "to do so one clearly has to have the simulated patterns of the topological signatures of the manifolds , which can be achieved by the mpsh approach discussed in this work .",
    "in this letter we have studied , through simulations concerning closed flat models of our universe , some general results obtained in ref.@xcite , namely , that topological spikes in psh s arise from translations , while non - translational isometries manifest as slight deformations of the epsh of the corresponding simply connected case .",
    "we have used the technique of taking means of psh s , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , to reduce the noise to a level that allows ( i ) to distinguish between topological and statistical spikes , and ( ii ) to evince the shape of the topological signature of non - translational isometries .",
    "in particular , we have shown explicitly that topological spikes for a cubic manifold @xmath4 of class @xmath1 with @xmath118 , appear only at even integers in plots of @xmath119 vs. @xmath120 , so the spike at @xmath121 reported in fig.1 of ref.@xcite is indeed due to statistical fluctuations , in agreement with the theoretical conclusion we have derived from the results of @xcite .",
    "identifying the shape of the topological signature of non - translational isometries is possible only through a drastic reduction of the statistical noise followed by the elimination of the uncorrelated part of the epsh together with the topological spikes .",
    "this last step has been attained by subtracting the epsh of the minimal 3-torus that covers @xmath4 from an mpsh built from @xmath4 and with small enough noise . in doing so",
    "we have shown that the topological signature of non - translational isometries is formed by broad and tiny distributions , each one beginning with a `` jump''at @xmath122 , for some isometry @xmath44 .",
    "the methods employed in this work allowed the study of the nature of the topological signature in cc of euclidean non - translational isometries , but can be equally applied to any of the other two geometries of constant curvature .",
    "note , however , that these methods may not be useful in applications of cc to real catalogs , since it is impossible in practice to construct thousands , or even hundreds , of comparable catalogs of real cosmic sources .",
    "for an implementation of cc along these lines for use with real catalogs , a novel technique for reducing statistical noise with just one catalog has to be developed .",
    "we emphasize however that , despite the use of mpsh s be restricted to simulated catalogs , it is a suitable approach for studying the topological signature of non - translational isometries in psh s , and thus it is a very important tool for the understanding of the method of cc",
    ". clearly , without the understanding which arises from the mpsh approach to cc it would be quite difficult to establish the applicability of the crystallographic method as well as to devise alternative methods in a systematic way .",
    "we thank the brazilian scientific agencies cnpq and capes for financial support .",
    "in this appendix we show explicitly that there are no topological spikes at odd integer positions in psh s constructed from models using @xmath4 ( given by the covering group @xmath0 generated by ( [ generators ] ) ) as spatial sections of spacetime . from the relations @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , and from the fact that @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are translations , and so they commute , one can write any covering isometry of @xmath4 in one of the two canonical forms    where @xmath100 , @xmath14 and @xmath115 are integers , and @xmath131 . for all @xmath100 and @xmath14",
