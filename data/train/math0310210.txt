    "let @xmath0 be a simply connected subset of the hexagonal faces in the planar honeycomb lattice .",

    "suppose further that the boundary faces of @xmath0 are partitioned into a `` left boundary '' component , colored black , and a `` right boundary '' component , colored white , in such a way that the set of interior faces remains simply connected .",
    "( see figure [ hesetuphexagons ] . ) given any black  white coloring of the faces of @xmath0 , there will be a  unique interface @xmath1 separating the cluster of black hexagons containing the left boundary from the cluster of white hexagons containing the right boundary .",
    "if the colors are chosen via independent bernoulli percolation , we may view  @xmath1 as being generated dynamically as follows : simply begin the path @xmath1 at an edge separating the left and right boundary components ; when @xmath1 hits a black hexagon , it turns right , and when it hits a white hexagon , it turns left .",
    "each time it hits a hexagon whose color has yet to be determined , we choose that hexagon s color with a coin toss .",
    "the _ harmonic explorer _ ( he ) is a random interface generated the same way , except that each time @xmath1 hits a hexagon @xmath2 whose color has yet to be determined , we perform a simple random walk on the space of hexagons , beginning at @xmath2 , and let @xmath2 assume the color of the first black or white hexagon hit by that walk .",
    "( see figure  [ hesetuphexagons ] . ) in other words , we color @xmath2 black with probability equal to the value at  @xmath2 of the function which is equal to @xmath3 on the black faces and @xmath4 on the white faces , and is _ discrete harmonic _ at the undetermined faces ( i.e. , its value at each such face is the mean of the values on the six neighboring faces ) .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the value of this function after @xmath6 steps of the harmonic explorer process ; that is , @xmath7 is @xmath3 if @xmath2 is black , @xmath4 if @xmath2 is white , and discrete harmonic on the faces of undetermined color .",
    "note that @xmath7 is also the probability that a random walk on faces , started at @xmath2 , hits a black face before hitting a white face .",
    "it is easy to see ( and proved below ) that for any fixed @xmath2 , @xmath7 is a martingale  and that the harmonic explorer is the only random path with this property .",
    "we will see later that @xmath8 is the only random path with a certain continuous analog of this property .",
    "it was conjectured in  @xcite and proved in @xcite that if the interior hexagons are each colored via critical bernoulli percolation ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , then , in a certain well - defined sense , the random paths @xmath1 tend to the stochastic loewner evolution with parameter @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) as the hexagonal mesh gets finer .",
    "( see the survey  @xcite for background on sle . )",
    "it has been further conjectured  @xcite that if colors are instead chosen from a critical fk cluster model ( where one weights configurations according to the total number of clusters and the lengths of their interfaces ) , then @xmath1 will converge to some @xmath12 with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 depends on the weight parameters .",
    "we will prove that , as the mesh gets finer , the harmonic explorer converges to chordal @xmath8 .",
    "there are also natural variants of the harmonic explorer ; for example , we might replace the honeycomb lattice with another three - regular lattice or replace the simple random walk on faces with a different periodic markov chain .",
    "one may even use a non - three - regular lattice provided one fixes an appropriate ordering ( say , left to right ) for determining the color of multiple undetermined faces that are `` hit '' simultaneously by the he path . provided the simple random walk converges to brownian motion as the mesh gets finer , we see no barrier to extending our results to all of these settings .",
    "our proofs are more like the lerw proofs in  @xcite ( which hold for general lattices ) than the percolation proof in @xcite ( which uses the invariance of the lattice under @xmath15 rotation in an essential way ) . however , for simplicity , we will focus only on the hexagonal lattice in this paper .",
    "although physicists and mathematicians have conjectured that many models for random self - avoiding lattice walks have conformally invariant scaling limits [ e.g. , the infinite self - avoiding walk , critical percolation cluster boundaries on two - dimensional lattices , critical ising model interfaces , critical fk cluster boundaries and @xmath16 model strands , etc . ] , rigorous proofs are available only in the following cases : percolation interface on the hexagonal lattice ( which converges to chordal  @xmath11 ) , harmonic explorer ( chordal @xmath8 ) , loop erased random walk ( lerw ) on a periodic planar graph ( radial @xmath17 @xcite ) , the uniform spanning tree ( ust ) boundary ( chordal @xmath18 @xcite ) and the boundaries of simple random walks ( essentially @xmath19 @xcite  here conformal invariance follows easily from the conformal invariance of brownian motion ) .",
    "the harmonic explorer is similar in spirit to the loop erased random walk ( lerw ) and diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) .",
    "all three models are processes based on simple random walks , and their transition probabilities may all be computed using discrete harmonic functions with appropriate boundary conditions . since simple random walks on two - dimensional lattices have a conformally invariant scaling limit ( brownian motion ) , and since harmonicity ( in the continuous limit ) is a conformally invariant property , one might expect that all three models would have conformally invariant scaling limits .",
    "however , simulations suggest that dla is not conformally invariant .",

    "the strategy of our @xmath8 proof will be , roughly speaking , to show that the fact that this property holds at two distinct values of @xmath42 is enough to force the loewner driving process for the path traced by the harmonic explorer to converge to brownian motion .",
