    "centimeter - wave @xmath0-doublet rotational transitions of formaldehyde (; figure [ h2co_levels ] ) can be collisionally `` refrigerated '' below the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature such that these transitions absorb cmb photons @xcite .",
    "the manner in which the centimeter lines of  are cooled is equivalent to a maser pumping process : a pump drives an over - population of states , but in this case they are lower - energy states , and the level populations become `` anti - inverted '' compared to thermal .",
    "when the line excitation temperature drops below the local cmb temperature , cmb photons may be absorbed .",
    "since absorption lines are detectable independent of distance , and since the cmb illuminates all gas and provides an exceptionally uniform illumination that lies behind every galaxy , a formaldehyde deep field ( fdf ) can provide a _",
    "mass - limited _ census of the dense molecular gas associated with star formation . if multiple lines are observed then physical molecular gas densities may also be obtained fairly independently of the gas kinetic temperature or other factors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the properties of the anti - inverted centimeter - wave  @xmath0-doublet lines as a function of physical conditions and cosmological redshift in a feasibility study for a census of the cosmic gas evolution and star formation history via an fdf .",
    "we also discuss the possibility that  lines can provide a standardizable ruler for cosmology and may contaminate 21 cm tomography observations of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) .",
    "this work examines radiative transfer models only , but is supported by observations of our galaxy @xcite , nearby starburst galaxies @xcite , and the gravitational lens galaxy toward b0218 + 357 at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we assume a no - curvature cosmology with @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we use the radex one - dimensional non - lte radiative transfer code with the escape probability determined by the large velocity gradient ( lvg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) approximation to examine the excitation and thus detectability and interpretation of cm  lines @xcite .",
    "we employ the h@xmath1 collision rate coefficients calculated by @xcite for the 10 lowest levels of ortho-  ( to @xmath7 ; figure [ h2co_levels ] ) for gas kinetic temperatures of 5100  k. we have compared the results from this code with another lvg treatment @xcite and with radex ( using the lvg approximation ) , both using the @xcite collision rates scaled from he to h@xmath1 , and all are in good agreement for low h@xmath1 ortho - to - para ratio ( opr ) .",
    "the latter models include the first 40 energy levels of ortho- ; agreement between these models and those using only the 10 levels of @xcite lends credibility to our treatment of warm molecular gas in star - forming galaxies .    for the radiative transfer calculations we assume statistical equilibrium but allow all line excitation temperatures to float because the dominant collision partner , h@xmath1 , `` pumps ''  into non - thermal excitation state distributions .",
    "we assume that the cmb is the dominant continuum source and that there is no significant contribution to the radio continuum from the host galaxy itself .",
    "an examination of this effect in the starburst galaxy m81 shows a small effect that does not qualitatively alter our results @xcite .",
    "we also assume an /h@xmath1 abundance of @xmath8 , which is reasonable in molecular gas - rich galaxies , even at high redshift ( zeiger & darling 2010 obtain an abundance 0.1@xmath9 in the gravitational lens galaxy toward b0218 + 357 at @xmath2 ) , and an  opr of 3 .",
    "@xcite show that the anti - inversion of ortho-  is principally driven by collisions with para - h@xmath1 .",
    "since the  line excitation temperatures critically determine the detectability and interpretation of lines , the effect of the unknown h@xmath1 opr is a concern . to address this , we examine model runs with h@xmath1 opr of 3 and @xmath10 ( effectively zero ) and find small differences in line excitation temperature ( @xmath11  k ) and no significant effect on the broad results and interpretation ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the basic phenomenon of anti - inversion of cm  lines and their ability to produce silhouettes of star - forming galaxies against the cmb is robust to the unknown h@xmath1 opr , as is the nearly temperature- and redshift - independent nature of the line detectability and excitation .",
    "we examine the model predictions for cm  line excitation for varying @xmath12 , gas kinetic temperature , and redshift . when not varying , we assume @xmath13  @xmath14 , @xmath15  k , and h@xmath1 opr @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite infer ratios in the range 0.010.1 in cold galactic pre - stellar molecular gas )",
    ". we focus on the first five @xmath0-doublet lines because these produce the strongest signals ( millimeter lines thermalize in typical conditions ) , and the @xcite calculations do not include higher states .",
    "these lines have wavelengths of roughly 6 , 2 , 1 , 0.6 , and 0.4  cm ( 4.8 , 14.5 , 29.0 , 48.3 , and 72.4  ghz , respectively ) .",
    "the observed line temperature depends on the decrement between the rest - frame excitation temperature and cmb temperature , redshifted to @xmath16 , and the line optical depth : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19  k. for a non - unity covering factor , the optical depth would be correspondingly diminished .",
    "@xcite estimate the apparent line optical depths in nearby star - forming galaxies : 0.0020.007 in the 6  cm line and 0.00150.005 in the 2  cm line .",
    "@xcite estimate 0.017 at 6  cm and 0.008 at 2  cm in the molecular absorber toward b0218 + 357 at @xmath20 .",
    "the galactic range among ultracompact regions is similar , but with a higher upper bound : 0.0061.0 at 6  cm and 0.0030.3 at 2  cm @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to examine the observer - frame temperature decrement @xmath21 of cm  lines , which is equivalent to @xmath22 for optically thick lines .",
    "we focus on the excitation temperature of the cm  lines as a function of gas kinetic temperature , h@xmath1 density , and redshift because these factors will most significantly determine the utility and interpretation of  line observations at high redshift .",
    "our radiative transfer models show that the excitation temperature of cm  lines is a strong function of h@xmath1 number density , collisionally driven below @xmath23 over roughly three orders of magnitude , @xmath24  @xmath25  @xmath14 ( figure [ tx_vs_nh2 ] ) . at low densities",
    "the  transitions thermalize to the cmb temperature , @xmath26 , because the molecule becomes decoupled from the gas and assumes the radiation temperature . at high densities",
    "the  excitation thermalizes to the kinetic temperature , @xmath27 .",
    "the range over which  causes anti - inversion of the lines shifts slightly to higher densities with increasing redshift , by @xmath280.5 dex from @xmath16 to @xmath29 , but this is entirely due to the @xmath30  k scaling rather than a change in physical pumping conditions .",
    "the minimum @xmath22 likewise grows slightly ( becomes more negative ) with increasing redshift , decreasing by @xmath280.2  k from @xmath16 to @xmath31 .    for fixed  and",
    ", @xmath32 grows roughly linearly with redshift ( figure [ tx_vs_z ] ) .",
    "but since the cmb temperature scales as @xmath33  k , the redshift dependence largely drops out of @xmath22 , and the observable line decrement changes very weakly with redshift .",
    "thus , not only is there no distance dimming of anti - inverted cm lines thanks to the absorption of cmb photons , but the excitation conditions are not changed significantly by the growth of cmb temperature with redshift .    at each redshift ,  has a @xmath34 floor : the anti - inversion disappears when the radiation , excitation , and gas kinetic temperatures are equal ( figure [ tx_vs_tkin ] ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ tx_vs_tkin ] indicates a nearly redshift - proportional line excitation :  becomes insensitive to  once collisions dominate the level populations , and redshift alone dictates .",
    "except for @xmath35 , where  is very low , the line decrements are insensitive to after an initial drop from @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , higher energy @xmath0-doublet lines become anti - inverted at @xmath37 .",
    "the 6 and 1  cm lines show excellent overlap in @xmath22 for @xmath38 and a nearly -independent trend .",
    "as the upper panel of figure [ tx_vs_tkin ] shows , there is little change in the observed line depth versus redshift or  with the notable exception of the 6  cm line at @xmath39 , and there is rapid convergence of all lines at @xmath40 for realistic values of  ( @xmath41  k )",
    ". figure [ tx_vs_tkin ] also demonstrates that there is little variation in the excitation temperature ratios between lines for @xmath40 as a function of gas kinetic temperature .",
    "since line ratios indicate the h@xmath1 molecular gas density , this demonstrates that we do not need precise values for kinetic temperature to employ the  `` densitometer , '' regardless of redshift and regardless of observed lines .    for nearly all redshifts and in realistic physical conditions ,",
    "the 6  cm line shows the strongest anti - inversion , and the anti - inversion monotonically decreases with increasing line energy .",
    "remarkably , for most scenarios , the line decrements grow from @xmath16 to @xmath42 , making the lines more detectable at high redshift than locally .",
    "our model predictions for formaldehyde excitation are consistent with observations of molecular clouds in the galaxy , in nearby star - forming galaxies , and in a gravitational lens .",
    "galactic dark clouds show a 6  cm line decrement of @xmath43 to @xmath44 k @xcite , and an lvg model applied to galactic giant molecular clouds obtains comparable line decrements , ranging from @xmath451 to 0  k @xcite .",
    "the  observations and radiative transfer modeling of star - forming galaxies in the local universe by @xcite also agree with our models . the molecular cloud studied toward b0218 + 357 at @xmath2 by @xcite found line decrements of @xmath46  k for the 6  cm line ( for @xmath47 ) and @xmath451.5 to @xmath451.8  k for the 2  cm transition .",
    "an fdf would survey the history of cosmic star formation in a fashion similar to other star formation proxies such as co lines , ir / submillimeter luminosity , radio continuum , or uv light .",
    "but an fdf will differ from traditional proxies in three essential ways : ( 1 ) line detection is nearly distance - independent and thus a survey for  lines would be a dense molecular gas mass - limited survey ; ( 2 ) the  line strength is insensitive to gas kinetic temperature and dust temperature ; and ( 3 )  lines are unaffected by dust opacity .",
    "we suspect that an fdf may be as sensitive to extended gas - rich star - forming galaxies such as the `` bzk '' galaxies as it is to compact merger - induced starbursts such as ulirgs and star formation - dominated submm galaxies . while the fdf concept has its shortfalls , such as a reliance on radiative transfer modeling for interpretation , it is a useful survey tool that is orthogonal to current star formation survey methods , and it overcomes the problem of obtaining redshifts for dusty galaxies identified by their dust continuum",
    ".  lines select star - forming gas , eliminating the uncertain active galactic nucleus dust - heating contribution to continuum star formation proxies .",
    "the strongest signals will arise from the highest molecular gas masses , which will include submm galaxies , ulirgs , hylirgs , red quasar hosts , dust - obscured galaxies , and bzk galaxies .",
    "the requirements for an fdf are : ( 1 ) beam - matched observations to the star - forming region(s ) in galaxies ; ( 2 ) large bandwidth , which provides a large redshift span ; ( 3 ) spectral line sensitivity ; and ( 4 ) either observation of more than one  line or ancillary data in other parts of the em spectrum to break a one - line redshift degeneracy .",
    "radio interferometry meets these criteria and captures many galaxies per primary beam , but reduces the brightness temperature sensitivity .",
    "one should thus work at higher frequencies and use a more compact array , but higher frequency lines have lower optical depth and higher   ( reduced @xmath22 ; figures [ tx_vs_nh2 ] and [ tx_vs_z ] ) .",
    "a compromise can be found , likely using the 2 or 1 cm lines , despite the intrinsically stronger 6 cm line signal .",
    "figure [ angsize ] shows the angular size of 2 , 5 , and 10  kpc molecular regions and the jansky very large array ( vla ) synthesized beam for the 1 , 2 , and 6  cm  lines for redshifts 010 .",
    "the 4  ghz instantaneous frequency coverage of the c - band spans the remarkable redshift range @xmath486.2  most of the epoch of galaxy evolution  because as the 2  cm line redshifts out of the c - band , the 1  cm line enters the bandpass .",
    "even compact star - forming regions in galaxies could be beam - matched in the x - band over a significant redshift range for galaxy evolution studies : @xmath490.8 and @xmath502.6 simultaneously .",
    "a deep observation in one of these bands would detect _ every _ galaxy above the gas mass limit in the field of view and would provide spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "formaldehyde silhouettes of galaxies against the cmb offer a novel probe of cosmology similar to the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect in galaxy clusters .",
    "the thermal sz effect depends on the electron density as @xmath51 while the x - ray emission from the cluster gas depends on @xmath52 .",
    "a comparison of the two quantities yields a measure of the line - of - sight length scale of the cluster , @xmath53 .",
    "if the proper size and line - of - sight size are equal or can be related via models , then the observed angular size of the cluster yields the angular size ( or luminosity ) distance : @xmath54 a similar measurement may be possible using   absorption of the cmb in galaxies .",
    "line ratios indicate the local h@xmath1 density , and line depths yield the  column density .",
    "since the column density is simply the space density integrated along the line of sight , a comparison of the two quantities measures the line of sight physical size of the dense gas region of the galaxy .",
    "assuming the line of sight and proper sizes to be equal or the galaxy has a measurable inclination , one can measure @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) from a spatially resolved spectral line map .",
    "neither clusters nor galaxies are spherical , but many galaxies can be observed per field of view , and in a statistical aggregate of randomly oriented galaxies , the assumption of equal size and length scales will be valid .",
    "this redshift - independent   technique can employ galaxies far beyond the observed @xmath57 limit on clusters , providing a unique standard ruler from the end of reionization to the formation of galaxy clusters .",
    "while the number of galaxies with metal - rich gas at high redshift may decline compared to @xmath583 , molecules detected in quasar hosts up to @xmath59 have demonstrated that high density regions in the early universe form metals and molecules quickly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that one may be able to identify standard rulers at very high redshift and make unprecedented cosmological measurements over a large span of the age of the universe ( unlike cosmological redshift , @xmath56 and @xmath55 are history - integrated quantities ) .",
    "while the star - forming regions in galaxies may show size evolution with redshift , this method does not rely on a fixed size for galaxies , only on a measurable size .",
    "the largest possible source of uncertainty for  cosmology is the  abundance , which is needed to convert from @xmath12 to @xmath60 . since @xmath61 , but @xmath62 is the quantity derived from line ratios , the measured size of the molecular region in galaxies is inversely proportional to the  abundance .      one significant concern for studies of the 21  cm line before , during , and after the eor is whether  absorption of cmb photons may form a contaminating foreground .",
    "the main lines of interest would be those below or redshifted below @xmath63  mhz ( @xmath64 ) : the @xmath65 71.1  mhz and @xmath66 355.6  mhz lines of para-  are the best candidates ( figure [ h2co_levels ] ) .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath67 rotation ladder is 57.6  k above ground , but radiative transitions to lower para-  states are forbidden . as discussed in @xcite , warm molecular gas can populate the @xmath67 states and collisions with h@xmath1 will drive these meter - wave transitions to very low excitation temperatures , of order 1030  mk , nearly compensating for the low optical depths of these lines compared to the centimeter - wave lines .",
    "these low - frequency lines have a negligible excitation temperature compared to the cmb such that @xmath68  k  @xmath69  k , and the observed line depth is simply determined by its optical depth regardless of redshift .",
    "comparing  meter - wave optical depths to cosmological 21 cm signals of nominal brightness temperature 20  mk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that the @xmath65 and @xmath66 lines are weaker than the 21 cm line for @xmath70",
    ". however , our model predicts lines with @xmath71 and 0.007 , respectively . in slightly warmer 60  k gas",
    ", the optical depths rise to 0.4 and 0.02 , and both lines become a potentially problematic source of contamination to 21 cm tomography .",
    "the and  signals may be separable by angular scale and spectral width , but one can imagine unresolved star formation in foreground large - scale structures near the peak of cosmic star formation at @xmath723 creating  355.6  mhz line signatures that could mimic 21 cm signals at @xmath73 .",
    "collisions with h@xmath1 cause cm  lines to become `` anti - inverted '' to the point where line excitation temperatures drop below the rest - frame cmb temperature and thus create silhouettes of the dense molecular gas regions in galaxies against the uniform background .",
    "we have demonstrated using radiative transfer models that cm  lines observed in an fdf can provide a distance - independent extinction - free mass - limited census of the cosmic history of star formation .",
    "the detectability and interpretation of  line surveys is nearly independent of redshift and gas kinetic temperature .",
    "we have also examined the possibility that  lines can be used to standardize galaxies as cosmic rulers and that anti - inverted meterwave  lines may confuse or contaminate 21 cm tomography of the eor .",
