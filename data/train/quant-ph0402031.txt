    "for decades , quantum entanglement has been the focus of much work in the foundations of quantum mechanics , being particularly associated with quantum nonseparability , the violation of bell s inequalities , and the so - called einstein - pololsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox . beyond this fundamental aspect ,",
    "creating and manipulating of entangled states are essential for quantum information applications . among these applications are quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , and quantum positioning and clock synchronization @xcite .",
    "hence , quantum entanglement has been viewed as an essential resource for quantum information processing .",
    "recently much attention has been paid to continuous variable quantum information processing in which continuous - variable - type entangled pure states play a key role .",
    "for instance , two - state entangled coherent states are used to realize efficient quantum computation @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "two - mode squeezed vacuum states have been applied to quantum dense coding @xcite .",
    "especially , continuous variable teleportation @xcite has been experimentally demonstrated for coherent states of a light field @xcite by using entangled two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "it is also has been shown that a two - state entangled squeezed vacuum state can be used to realize quantum teleportation of an arbitrary coherent superposition state of two equal - amplitude and opposite - phase squeezed vacuum states @xcite .",
    "continuous - variable - type entangled states including squeezed states and coherent states have also been widely applied to and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is an interesting topic to create continuous - variable - type entangled pure states .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that atoms and photons can be viewed as carriers of storing and transmitting quantum information .",
    "atoms are suited for storing quantum information at a fixed location , and they are sources of local entanglement for quantum information processing while photons are natural sources for communications of quantum information since they can transverse over long distances .",
    "one topic of particular interest in this context is the possibility to generate atom - photon entangled states where one member is readily used to couple a distant system while the other is stored by the local sender . in this aspect",
    ", some progress has been made , and possible schemes have been proposed in recent years .",
    "for instance , moore and meystre @xcite proposed a scheme to generate atom - photon pairs via off - resonant light scattering from an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "deb and agarwal @xcite showed that it is possible to entangle three different many - particle states by bragg spectroscopy with nonclassical light in an atomic bec .",
    "gasenzer and co - workers @xcite investigated quantum entanglement characterized by the relative number squeezing between photons and atoms coupled out from an atomic bec . optical control over the bec quantum statistics and atom - photon quantum correlation in an atomic bec @xcite have been widely studied .    in this paper , we describe a method to produce atom - photon - entangled states of continuous - variable - type pure states in an atomic bec by electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "eit is a kind of quantum interference effects @xcite .",
    "it arises in three - level ( or multilevel ) systems and consists of the cancellation of the absorption on one transition induced by simultaneous coherent driving of another transition .",
    "the phenomenon can be understood as a destructive interference of the two pathways to the excited level and has been used to demonstrate ultraslow light propagation @xcite and light storage @xcite in many systems including atomic becs @xcite .",
    "the proposed system in present paper consists of an atomic bec with three internal states , one weak probe laser , and one relatively strong coupling laser with appropriate frequencies .",
    "the probe laser field is quantized while the coupling laser field is treated classically .",
    "they form a three - level lambda configuration .",
    "when the bec is in eit with the coupling laser being much stronger than the probe laser , the upper and intermediate levels are unpopulated due to quantum interference .",
    "adiabatic elimination of the two unpopulated levels enables an effective two - mode model involving only atoms in the lowest internal state and photons in the probe laser .",
    "we show that it is possible to generate atom - photon continuous - variable - type entangled pure states in the atomic bec .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the physical system under our consideration , review the reduction of the problem from four to two modes , followed by an analytic solution of the model , and then discuss the theoretical mechanism to create quantum entanglement in the proposed scheme . in sec .",
    "iii , we focus on a dynamical approach to creating a variety of atom - photon entangled pure states . two - state ,",
    "three - state , and four - state atom - photon continuous - variable - typed entangled pure states are generated explicitly .",
    "we shall conclude our paper with discussions and remarks in the last section .",
    "we consider a cloud of bec atoms which have three internal states labeled by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 with energies @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the two lower states @xmath1 and @xmath3 are metastable states in each of which the atoms can live for a long time .",
    "they are raman coupled to the upper state @xmath2 via , respectively , a quantized probe laser field and a classical coupling laser field of frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the lambda configuration .",
    "the interaction scheme is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the atoms in these internal states are subject to isotropic harmonic trapping potentials @xmath9 for @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the atoms in the bec interact with each other via elastic two - body collisions with the @xmath11-function potentials @xmath12 , where @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , being the atomic mass and the @xmath16-wave scattering length between atoms in states @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a good experimental candidate of this system is the sodium atom condensate for which there exist appropriate atomic internal levels and external laser fields to form the lambda configuration which is needed for reaching eit under our consideration .",

    "initially the lasers are outside the bec medium in which all atoms are in their ground state , i.e. , the internal state @xmath1 .",
    "the condensed atoms are generally in a superposition state of the state @xmath1 and the state @xmath3 when they are in eit . however , when the coupling laser is much stronger than the probe laser , atomic population at the intermediate level approaches zero while the upper level is unpopulated @xcite . hence , under the condition of @xmath69 , the terms which involve @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) may be neglected , and from the hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) we can adiabatically eliminate the atomic field operators in the internal states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "firstly , the atomic operators in the internal state @xmath2 @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be adiabatically eliminated with the replacements : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which come from the adiabatic elimination process in heisenberg equations @xmath76=0 $ ] and @xmath77=0 $ ] , respectively . from eq.([8 ] ) we can obtain the following effective hamiltonian @xmath78 which contains only atomic field operators in internal states @xmath1 and @xmath3 and the probe field operators .",
    "here we have set @xmath79 and introduced @xmath80    the first part @xmath81 in the third term of eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) describes such a quantum transition process where an atom in the lowest internal state @xmath1 absorbs a photon in the probe laser and then it transits to the intermediate internal state @xmath3 .",
    "the second part @xmath82 describes the inverse process of this process .",
    "then from the hamiltonian ( [ 9 ] ) the atomic field operators in the third internal state can be adiabatically eliminated through the replacements : @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and the final effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath85    the effective hamiltonian ( [ 11 ] ) is diagonal in the fock space with the bases defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath14 take non - negative integers .    from the effective hamiltonian ( [ 11 ] ) we can well understand the theoretical mechanism to create atom - photon quantum entanglement in present scheme . comparing ( [ 11 ] )",
    "with ( [ 8 ] ) we can see that for the bec in the eit , through adiabatically eliminating the atomic field operators at the upper and intermediate levels the laser - atom dipole interactions are converted as an effective collisional interaction between photons in the probe laser and condensed atoms in the internal state @xmath1 which can be described as effective elastic collisions between photons in the probe laser and condensed atoms in the internal state @xmath1 . from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) we can know that the effective scattering length to describe the atom - photon collisions is proportional to the ratio of the square of the dipole interaction and the two - photon detuning .",
    "one can manipulate signs of the effective scattering length by changing signs of the two - photon detuning .",
    "therefore , atom - photon quantum entanglement is produced by atom - photon and atom - atom collisional interactions described by the second and third terms in the effective hamiltonian ( [ 11 ] ) , respectively , and one can control or manipulate atom - photon entanglement by varying the dipole interaction strength between the probe laser and the bec and the two - photon detuning to create desired atom - photon entangled states .",
    "it should be mentioned that in most textbook introductions to eit @xcite , both the probe and coupling lasers are treated classically , the decay of the excited state is included in the dynamics of the internal state through a set of density - matrix equations of the atomic system , the decay promotes the trapping of the atom into a dark state .",
    "contrary to the usual treatment of eit , the probe laser is quantized in this paper .",
    "a limitation of our present treatment is that we have ignored the decay rates of various levels .",
    "however , this ignorance of the decay rates is a good approximation for the adiabatic eit that we study in the present paper , since the adiabatic eit is insensitive to any possible decay of the top level @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate generation of various atom - photon entangled states when the condensate in internal states @xmath1 and the probe laser are initially in non - entangled coherent states and superposition states of coherent states .",
    "we assume that the probe laser and the condensate are initially uncorrelated and in the product coherent state @xmath88 . with the laser fields turned on at @xmath89 , then at time",

    "we rewrite the state ( [ 14 ] ) as the following simple form @xmath92 where we have used a scaled time @xmath93 and a running frequency @xmath94 where we have introduced a real effective interaction parameter @xmath95 defined by @xmath96 which describes an effective interaction induced by three adjustable parameters : the dipole interaction strength @xmath97 , the inter - atomic interaction strength @xmath98 , and the two - photon detuning @xmath99 .",

    "( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) we can see that the time evolution characteristic of the system under our consideration is completely determined by the effective interaction parameter .",
    "we note that the wavefunction of the system ( [ 15 ] ) is a two - mode extension of generalized coherent states @xcite .",
    "these generalized coherent states differ from a conventional glauber coherent state by an extra phase factor appearing in the decomposition of such states into a superposition of fock states .",
    "they can always be represented as a continuous sum of coherent states . and",
    "under appropriate periodic conditions , they can reduce to discrete superpositions of coherent states .",
    "it should be kept in mind that we use to create continuous - variable - type entangled states what we expect .",

    "( [ 19 ] ) indicates that the state @xmath102 is a continuous superposition state of two - mode product coherent states .",

    "( [ 16 ] ) to ( [ 19 ] ) we can see that the values of the real parameter @xmath95 may seriously affect the form of the wavefunction ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "of particular interesting is a situation where @xmath95 may take values of nonzero integers . in this case , making use of ( [ 16 ] ) from ( [ 15 ] ) we can see that @xmath103 , which implies that the time evolution of the wavefunction ( [ 15 ] ) is a periodic evolution with respect to scaled time @xmath104 with the period @xmath105 . on the other hand ,",
    "suppose that the scaled time @xmath104 takes its values in the following manner @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are mutually prime integers , then we can find @xmath109 = \\exp\\left[i2\\pi\\frac{m}{n } \\theta_{n , m}\\right],\\ ] ] which means that the exponential phase function in the state ( [ 19 ] ) @xmath110 $ ] is a periodic function with respect to both @xmath87 and @xmath14 with the same period @xmath108 .",

    "the concurrence equals one for a maximally entangled state .    in order to calculate the concurrence of continuous - variables - type entangled states like ( [ 27 ] ) , we consider a general biparticle entangled state @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are _ normalized _ states of subsystem @xmath115 and @xmath136 and @xmath137 normalized states of subsystem @xmath138 with complex @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a method to generate continuous - variable - type entangled states between photons and atoms in atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method involves an atomic bec with three internal states , a weak quantized probe laser and a strong classical coupling laser , which form a three - level @xmath0-shaped bec system . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a situation where the bec is in electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) with the coupling laser being much stronger than the probe laser . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the upper and intermediate levels are unpopulated , so that their adiabatic elimination enables an effective two - mode model involving only the atomic field at the lowest internal level and the quantized probe laser field . </S>",
    "<S> atom - photon quantum entanglement is created through laser - atom and inter - atomic interactions , and two - photon detuning . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to generate atom - photon entangled coherent states and entangled states between photon ( atom ) coherent states and atom-(photon- ) macroscopic quantum superposition ( mqs ) states , and between photon - mqs and atom - mqs states .    </S>",
