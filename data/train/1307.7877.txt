    "supernova remnants are laboratories for studying optical shocks . an optical spectrum dominated by balmer lines",
    "is seen when a fast astrophysical shock enters partly neutral interstellar gas .",
    "balmer dominated shocks ( bdss ) are characterized by velocities higher than 200 , the presence of two - component h@xmath0 line , the absence of forbidden lines of metals in low ionization states , and general lack of non - thermal x - ray emission at the location where h@xmath0 lines are detected ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* heng 2010 ) ) .",
    "bdss are observed around historical supernova remnants ( snrs ) like tycho , kepler and sn1006 .",
    "+ the hydrogen lines consist of a narrow ( @xmath110 ) and a broad ( @xmath11000 ) component .",
    "the narrow component is produced by cold hydrogen atoms in the pre - shock ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) that are collisionally excited by electrons and protons in the shock . while the broad component is produced by post - shock hot neutrals , created through charge exchange between incoming hydrogen atoms and hot protons in the shock .",
    "thus , the two - component h@xmath0 lines directly yield the pre - shock and post - shock temperatures of the ism around the remnant . the balmer line profiles also contain signatures of shock precursors . investigating in detail the shape of the h@xmath0 line",
    "has the potential to provide strong observational constraints on cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "in particular , the crs will heat the cold hydrogen atoms in the ism before they are being ionized by the shock , resulting in a narrow h@xmath0 line of which the width is broadened beyond the normal 10 - 20gas dispersion .",
    "the crs can also carry away energy from the protons in the post - shock , so that the broad h@xmath0 line has a smaller width than allowed by the fast shock velocity . because the cr precursor is typically spatially unresolved , its additional contribution to the narrow - line h@xmath0 emission results in a decreasing broad - to - narrow intensity line ratio .",
    "the presence of crs can also cause the shape of the broad h@xmath0 line to deviate from a gaussian profile ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* raymond  2010 ) ) .",
    "+ here we present high - spatial resolution spectro - photometric imaging of the remnants sn1006 and tycho , and investigate the h@xmath0-line profiles in detail .",
    "the long - slits typically used to measure the h@xmath0 line have low spatial resolutions resulting in the contribution of multiple shock fronts to the measured h@xmath0 line .",
    "it is then unclear whether the line shape , including its width , are contaminated by this geometric effect . optical integral - field unit ( ifu )",
    "spectrographs are able to trace and distinguish multiple , projected shocks . since bdss have not been investigated before with ifus , our aim in this pilot study was to demonstrate that such observations can be executed and that the scientific yields constitute a marked improvement over previous studies .",
    "we used the vimos - ifu spectrograph on the very large telescope ( vlt ) to investigate the fast optical shocks at the northwestern ( nw ) rim of the remnant of sn1006 ( see figure  [ fig : sn1006_vimos ] ) .",
    "the 27@xmath2@xmath327@xmath2field - of - view ( fov ) of the vimos - ifu on a 8 m telescope enables us to collect enough photons in a reasonable time to reach the high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) required to accurately measure the shape of the h@xmath0 line , including deviations from a gaussian profile . the high spatial resolution of 0.@xmath267 ( @xmath42@xmath310@xmath5 cm at the distance of @xmath42kpc ) , in combination with the two - dimensional coverage of the vimos - ifu allow us to precisely trace the narrow shock front .",
    "the spectral resolution with dispersion of @xmath648  is more than sufficient to measure the width of the broad line of 2000 - 3000 , as well as deviations from a gaussian profile .",
    "the width of the narrow line of @xmath620can not be resolved , but its intensity can be accurately measured .",
    "+ as a first analysis we combined the spectra from four different regions parallel to the shock front ( for coloured figures see nikolic  2013 ) and analyzed the resulting two - component h@xmath0 lines shown in figure  [ fig : sn1006_spatial ] .",
    "performing double - gaussian fits we extracted various parameters , including the broad - to - narrow line ratio ( @xmath7 ) , velocity offset ( @xmath8v ) from the narrow component and the fhwm of the broad - line component ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "already strong variation in @xmath7 and @xmath9 , as well as hint of non - gaussianity in the broad - line core point towards the presence of a precursor in the shock .      in order to investigate spatial variations of the physical characteristics across the shock front",
    ", we used the method of cappellari & copin ( 2003 ) to combine the neighboring pixels and create 133 spatial ( voronoi ) bins in which the combined spectra have a minimal s / n of 40 .",
    "we fitted double - gaussian to the lines and extracted again the same parameters ( per bin ) as before : @xmath7 , @xmath8v and @xmath9 .",
    "we then converted for each bin @xmath9 and @xmath7 to a shock velocity and electron - to - proton temperature ratio ( @xmath10 ) using the model of van adelsberg  ( 2008 ) .",
    "the variations of the intensity ratios and broad - line widths along with the distances calculated from derived shock velocities and the proper motion measurements of 280masyr@xmath11 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* winkler  2003 ) ) are shown in the three right panels of figure  [ fig : sn1006_spatial ] .",
    "nearly 85% of the observed values ( represented with empty triangles and squares ) are out of the range predicted by the model , which does not include cr physics .",
    "strong spatial variations in the intensity ratios and broad - line widths , the fact that the most of our observed values are not in the model predicted range , and the hint of the non - gaussianity in the broad - line core all together indicate the potential presence of suprathermal protons , non - thermal particles which might be the seed particles for generating high - energy crs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nikolic  2013 ) ) .",
    "integral - field spectrographs are able to trace and distinguish multiple , projected shocks , but still , the field - of - view of these spectrographs typically covers only a small portion of the full remnant .",
    "henceforth , we use osiris narrow - band tunable filter imaging at gtc ( gran telescopio canarias ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution of 0.@xmath2125 per pixel avoids geometric effects , while the large field - of - view of 4@xmath12@xmath34@xmath12  allows to measure the width of the broad component of the h@xmath0 line of the shock fronts in the full northeastern part of the remnant of tycho s supernova .",
    "our goal is to map the changing cr acceleration efficiency along the remnant by measuring broad h@xmath0-line widths smaller than expected from the high shock velocities , which we know independently from proper motion measurements of the shock fronts .",
    "+ osiris low spectral resolution prevents resolving the narrow h@xmath0 component . in order to precisely measure the intrinsic narrow h@xmath0-line width",
    ", we use the fabry - perot interferometer ghafas at the wht ( william herschel telescope ) which has the unique capability to scan with a spectral resolution as fine as 8 .",
    "this enables us to directly quantify the presence of the cr precursor .",
    "the high spatial resolution of 0.@xmath22 plus large fov 3.@xmath124@xmath33.@xmath124 of ghafas allow us to differentiate between different individual shock fronts along tycho s supernova remnant . observing exactly the same parts of the tycho s remnant with both osiris and ghafas",
    ", we expect to place tight constrains on cr precursors in tycho s snr .",
