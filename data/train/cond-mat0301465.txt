    "understanding the behavior of an elastic interface in a random potential is important for many experimental systems and still offers a considerable theoretical challenge @xcite . it is expected that below the upper critical dimension @xmath5 the interface is pinned by arbitrarily weak disorder , into some rough configurations and that at zero temperature it can acquire a non - zero velocity under an applied force @xmath6 only if @xmath6 is larger than the depinning threshold @xmath7 .",
    "a functional renormalization group ( frg ) method predicts that @xmath8 for the statics @xcite , and for the simplest universality class , the so called isotropic depinning @xcite .    there has been recent progress towards a precise description of the depinning transition . from the theory side , the frg for single component manifolds , originally studied to one loop in an expansion in @xmath9 , has now been extended to a field theory shown to be renormalizable to two loops .",
    "renormalizable , we recall , means it has a well defined continuum limit , which is independent of all microscopic details , and thus ensures universality of large scale observables .",
    "presumably there exists a fully renormalizable theory to all orders , with full predictive power @xcite . from the side of numerics",
    "a novel powerful algorithm allows to obtain the configurations at ( or just below ) depinning with much improved accuracy @xcite .",
    "a reasonable agreement between the two methods was found in a measurement of the roughness exponent @xmath2 , especially the clear conclusion that @xmath10 contrarily to a previous conjecture @xcite ( @xmath11 ) based on the 1-loop analysis .",
    "the field theory of depinning in its present form is unconventional in that one must work with a non - analytic action .",
    "this peculiar feature is a deep part of the physics of the problem and necessary to avoid the so called dimensional reduction .",
    "it makes the perturbation theory superficially `` ambiguous '' . a non - trivial step taken in @xcite to define the theory at @xmath12 as the limit",
    "@xmath13 of the moving phase , was to assume that the interface - position is monotonic in time .",
    "this removes the ambiguity and , remarkably , leads to a renormalizable theory , to at least two loops @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the `` non - crossing theorems '' which apply to single component depinning and , remarkably , is the same property allowing to show ergodicity and to construct an efficient algorithm to find the exact critical configuration at depinning @xcite .",
    "the origin of recent progresses in both numerics and field theory are thus related .",
    "clearly one would like to test this novel field theory by calculating more universal measurable quantities and study its properties .",
    "in this paper we further explore the field theory constructed in @xcite .",
    "we study displacement correlations of more than two points .",
    "we find that these correlations are _",
    "static_. although physically natural , if one wants quasi - static depinning to make sense , this manifests itself through rather non - trivial massive cancellations in the time dependence of multi - point diagrams .",
    "we elucidate these cancellations and obtain as a consequence for a large class of diagrams much simpler diagrammatic rules than previously anticipated .",
    "basically , all time integrals become almost trivial , resulting in a theory with `` quasi static '' diagrams .",
    "we then apply these properties to the calculation of universal observables .",
    "one natural universal quantity is the so - called width distribution of the interface .",
    "interestingly , to the two lowest leading orders in @xmath14 , the distribution coincides with the one for a gaussian theory with the full non - trivial propagator @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the depinning exponent .",
    "this is also the subject of a related publication @xcite , where the distribution is also measured numerically .",
    "here we give a detailed presentation and also compute the higher connected cumulants of the displacement field , i.e.  deviations from the gaussian .",
    "some of these results are quoted in @xcite .",
    "in a second part we study the theory at the upper critical dimension .",
    "the motivation is that no exact result is available to confirm that @xmath8 ( the only exactly solved limit corresponding to fully connected models @xcite ) .",
    "thus the question of what is the upper critical dimension @xmath5 is still debated , even though the field theory of depinning @xcite clearly predicts @xmath8 .",
    "also , in the other class of depinning transitions , the so called anisotropic depinning class with kpz nonlinearities , there is not even a convincing prediction for @xmath5 @xcite and recent numerical studies have reopened the debate @xcite .",
    "recently it has become possible to study numerically depinning and statics in high dimensional spaces for reasonable system sizes with better precision , allowing for the hope to settle the issue of the upper critical dimension in the near future @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to give precise predictions for the behavior predicted by the frg , in order to compare with numerics .",
    "finally , we also clarify the issue of finite size scaling . in a previous work , used in several simulations ,",
    "the value @xmath15 was used for the finite size scaling exponent @xcite .",
    "we find that the correct value is instead @xmath3 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we define the model , briefly review the frg method and field theory and define the main observable of interest here , the width distribution . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we compute the laplace transform of the width distribution in perturbation theory and find that to lowest order in @xmath17 it coincides with a gaussian approximation .",
    "this approximation is introduced and further studied .",
    "some results on laplace inversion are given .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] we go beyond the gaussian approximation and compute higher connected cumulants .",
    "the detailed calculation of the fourth cumulant ( 4-point connected correlation function of the displacement field ) is given , and the cancellations that occur in the field theory are studied . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we discuss the upper critical dimension and in section [ sec6 ] the finite size scaling .",
    "the effect of various boundary conditions is studied in appendix [ differentbound ] .",
    "we study the over - damped dynamics described by the equation of motion @xmath18 with friction @xmath19 .",
    "long range elasticity relevant for solid friction at the upper critical dimension @xmath20 , can be studied replacing @xmath21 . in presence of an applied force @xmath6 the center of mass velocity",

    "the pinning force is @xmath23 and thus the second cumulant of the force is @xmath24 such that @xmath25 in the bare model , where @xmath26 is the correlator of the random potential .",
    "random bond disorder is modeled by a short range function @xmath26 , random field ( rf ) disorder of amplitude @xmath27 by @xmath28 at large @xmath29 and cdw disorder by a periodic function @xmath26 .",
    "let us briefly review the field theoretic approach , more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the dynamical action ( msr ) averaged over disorder is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 = \\int_{xt } \\hat u_{xt } ( \\partial_t - \\nabla_x^2 ) u_{xt } - \\frac12 \\int_{xtt ' } \\hat u_{xt } \\delta(u_{xt}-u_{xt ' } ) \\hat u_{xt'}\\ ] ] here and below we denote @xmath32 , in fourier @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the frg shows that the full function @xmath35 becomes relevant below @xmath36 and a flow equation for its scale dependence has been derived to one and two loops , in an expansion in @xmath37 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was derived by adding a small mass @xmath38 as an infrared cutoff and computing the flow of disorder , defined from the effective action @xmath39 $ ] of the theory , as @xmath38 decreases towards zero . as in @xcite",
    "we will denote by @xmath40 the bare disorder correlator , i.e.  the one appearing in the action @xmath41 in ( [ 3 ] ) , and by @xmath35 the renormalized one , appearing in @xmath39 $ ] which has a similar expression as ( [ 3 ] ) . the rescaled disorder",
    "is then defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the 1-loop integral .",
    "it was then shown in @xcite that ( [ 3 ] ) leads to a functional renormalization group equation @xmath44 '' \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ ( \\tilde \\delta(u ) - \\tilde \\delta(0 ) ) \\tilde \\delta'(u)^2 \\right ] '' { \\nonumber}\\\\   & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\tilde \\delta'(0^+)^2 \\tilde \\delta''(u ) \\label{rgdisorder}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to @xmath45 terms .",
    "this equation implies that there are only two main universality classes at depinning , a single rf fixed point for interfaces and a periodic one for cdw type disorder @xcite .",
    "both @xmath2 and the fixed point function @xmath46 were determined to order @xmath47 for these classes @xcite .",
    "the important feature of the field theory of depinning is that @xmath35 has a cusp - like non - analyticity at @xmath48 . as was shown in @xcite calculations in the non - analytic theory ( e.g.  yielding ( [ rgdisorder ] ) )",
    "are meaningfully performed using the expansion : @xmath49 performing wick averages yields the usual diagrams , except that their actual values involve averages of e.g.  sign functions of the fields . replacing everywhere @xmath50 is justified for single component quasi - static depinning ( i.e.  in the limit of vanishing velocity @xmath51 ) .",
    "this yields diagrams with sometimes complicated internal time and momentum dependences .",
    "we find however that in some cases massive cancellations occur despite the complications due to the time dependence between various diagrams , contributing to the same observable .      to motivate the present study let us consider one specific example of a universal observable , the width distribution of the configuration at depinning ( the so - called critical configuration ) .",
    "the width of a configuration is defined _ in a given disorder realization _ as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the center of mass and @xmath54 the volume of the system .",
    "the basic observation is that the sample to sample probability distribution @xmath55 of @xmath56 is expected to be universal , with a single scale set by the disorder averaged second cumulant @xmath57 , i.e : @xmath58 @xmath59 is a universal function .",
    "this holds for thermal averages in a number of finite temperature problems of pure systems @xcite .",
    "here we show that it also holds for depinning at @xmath12 and compute the distribution , first within a simple gaussian approximation and second within the @xmath17-expansion . in the process",
    "we study higher point correlation functions in the field theory of depinning , define specific universal ratios of these , describing deviations from gaussian behavior and compute them .    before turning to actual calculations let us first summarize the general spirit of the method and discuss the question of the universality of such observables .",
    "the hallmark of a renormalizable theory is that if one expresses the correlation functions in an expansion in the _ renormalized _ disorder @xmath60 , then the resulting expressions are uv finite , equivalently they have a well defined continuum limit , independent of short scale details . on a technical level",
    ", this can be achieved by computing correlations in standard perturbation theory to a given order in powers of @xmath61 , and then using the relation between renormalized disorder @xmath60 and bare one @xmath61 to the same order , or equivalently through the definition of appropriate counter - terms .",
    "perturbatively from @xmath60 to a given order then @xmath61 is not the original bare action ( which is analytic ) thus there is no contradiction in @xmath61 being non - analytic . in a sense introducing @xmath61 is just a trick to express a closed equation for the flow of @xmath60 to the same order . ] here , we restrict ourselves to calculations at dominant order in @xmath17 and thus using either @xmath60 or @xmath61 makes no difference . beyond the larkin scale ,",
    "however , these are non - analytic functions , which is crucial .    in the limit of large scales or large system sizes ,",
    "the fixed point form reached by the rescaled @xmath60 implies that the resulting observable , e.g.  the width distribution , is _ universal_. universal means that these quantities do not depend on the short scale details .",
    "however they _ do depend _ on the details of the large scale infrared ( ir ) cutoff , i.e.  of the type of chosen boundary conditions . here",
    "we focus on _ periodic boundary conditions _",
    "@xcite , also of interest for numerical simulations @xcite , although we sometimes give results for other types , for instance for the massive ir cutoff described in the previous paragraph .",
    "since the frg method developed in @xcite and summarized above uses a mass as ir - cutoff and defines disorder vertices at zero momentum , one should be careful in calculations with e.g.  periodic boundary conditions . since we only compute observables either to dominant order in @xmath17 , or within a 1-loop approximation , it is easy to make the necessary replacements , as will be indicated below .",
    "for instance the 1-loop frg equation remains identical to the two first lines of ( [ rgdisorder ] ) , the only changes being that    1 .",
    "@xmath62 has to be replaced by @xmath63 .",
    "2 .   @xmath64 in the definition of the rescaled disorder .",
    "the 1-loop integral @xmath65 entering into the definition of the rescaled disorder has to be replaced by its homologue for periodic boundary conditions : ) to that periodic b.c .",
    "scheme , one would have to reevaluate 2-loop integrals with discrete sums , or carry other changes in the scheme .",
    "this however goes beyond the present 1-loop study . ]",
    "@xmath66 used below .",
    "let us start by giving the simplest approximation for this distribution .",
    "it can be derived in two ways : ( i ) perturbation theory in the renormalized theory to lowest order in @xmath17 ( ii ) a simple gaussian approximation . in the end",
    "this will motivate going further , i.e.  studying deviations from the gaussian approximation .",
    "we now study perturbation theory . to compute the width distribution using the dynamical field theoretic method @xcite",
    "one can start from the laplace transform @xmath67 with @xmath68 . here and below we omit the global multiplicative factor @xmath69 in the definition of @xmath56 , since in the end we will always normalize the distribution @xmath55 by fixing its first moment to unity ( in ( [ 2 ] ) it can be absorbed by a rescaling of @xmath70 ) .",
    "expanding in powers of the correlator of the pinning force @xmath35 ( to lowest order this is equivalent to @xmath61 see above ) , one finds that to leading order @xmath71 is the sum of all connected 1-loop diagrams , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    ) , terms @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( bottom ) , together with the vertices for disorder ( top left ) , @xmath56 ( top center ) , and response function ( top right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the loop with @xmath75 disorder vertices and @xmath75 insertions of @xmath56 is @xmath76 here and below the sums over @xmath77 thus runs over a @xmath78-dimensional hypercubic lattice with spacing @xmath79 , and the 0-mode is excluded , as appropriate for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "if one were now to resum ( [ one ] ) over @xmath75 one would find : @xmath80 with @xmath81 , a larkin model type result if interpreted as naive perturbation theory ( i.e.  if @xmath82 was interpreted as the bare original disorder rather than the renormalized one ) .",
    "the correct procedure implies that @xmath82 is the running renormalized disorder @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the ( non - universal ) value of the fixed point @xcite .",
    "although @xmath85 for the zero momentum disorder vertex , one notes that a momentum @xmath77 flows in each vertex and one should take care of this by setting @xmath86 .",
    "this yields finally ( [ il3 ] ) with @xmath87 where the value of @xmath88 is non - universal and fixed by @xmath57 . as will become clear in the following section , the appropriate choice for @xmath89 is the 2-point finite - size scaling - function @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the difference between the two above - mentioned choices for @xmath92 simply amounts to the two different limits of small , or large @xmath93 .",
    "however to lowest order in @xmath14 they are identical .",
    "( for a calculation of the scaling function to next order in @xmath17 see appendix j in ref .",
    "@xcite . )      a more general approach consistent with the previous calculation is the following .",
    "we first note that the above result ( [ final ] ) would be exact if the distribution of the displacement fields @xmath29 were _",
    "gaussian_. it can thus be called the gaussian approximation ( ga ) . to understand why it was obtained here",
    "let us consider simply the second connected cumulant of the wd @xmath94 .",
    "this cumulant however is not connected w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath29 , and thus there is an exact relation : @xmath95 where here @xmath96 is the exact disorder averaged 2-point function .",
    "the first term is just wick s theorem and would be the full result if the measure of the @xmath29 were gaussian .",
    "analogous formulae exist for higher cumulants : the first term on the r.h.s .  of ( [ conn ] )",
    "generalizes into @xmath97 as a simple consequence of wick s theorem .",
    "this is again easily resummed into ( [ final ] ) which would thus be exact if the measure of @xmath29 were exactly gaussian .",
    "note that all results of @xcite for pure gaussian theories can also easily be obtained by the present resummation method ( temperature replacing disorder ) .",
    "thus in the ga , the @xmath89 appearing in ( [ final ] ) is the exact 2-point function .",
    "it can be tested in a simulation by inserting the measured 2-point function in ( [ final ] ) . in the large but finite system size limit",
    "it takes the scaling function form @xmath98 discussed above .",
    "when comparing to the numerical results for the width distribution , it turns out that the ga is a surprisingly good approximation even down to @xmath99 .",
    "this is discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "however , we do not expect the ga to be exact .",
    "it is thus interesting to compute the deviation @xmath100 for the second cumulant of @xmath56 in ( [ conn ] ) .",
    "it is computed below and found to be of order @xmath101 while the ga contribution ( first term in ( [ conn ] ) ) is of order @xmath102 ( since @xmath103 ) .",
    "similarly the ga contribution to ( [ conn ] ) is @xmath104 , while the deviations are found to be @xmath105 .",
    "this can be summarized as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a gaussian random variable of @xmath108 and @xmath109 a non - gaussian one of @xmath108 .",
    "computing deviations from the ga is thus one motivation to compute higher point correlations .      before doing so ,",
    "let us discuss how the distribution @xmath110 is obtained through an inverse laplace - transform , as @xmath111 noting that in @xmath99 ( [ final ] ) can also be written as @xmath112 this is equivalent to @xmath113 this formula shows that for large @xmath114 , the distribution is dominated by the first term @xmath115 , and in practice summing the first few terms gives an excellent approximation .",
    "it is instructive to apply ( [ finallaptran ] ) to a random walk , where @xmath116 . using that ( @xmath117 ) @xmath118 one finds in terms of the width @xmath119",
    "@xmath120    for @xmath121",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "writing @xmath122 we have e.g.  at least multiplicity @xmath123 for each factor in ( [ il3 ] ) , as long as no component vanishes , but this multiplicity may even be higher , as can be seen from the following solutions of the diophantic equation ( for 2 dimensions ) @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and many more .",
    "let us define the class @xmath126 as @xmath127 let us index these classes by @xmath128 , and introduce an order @xmath129 note that since for @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( by definition we exclude @xmath132 ) @xmath133 is always even .",
    "( [ il2 ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath134 there are poles at @xmath135^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the sum over these poles can after partial integration be written as    @xmath136\\right|_{\\lambda = - [ 2 g ( q_{\\alpha } ) ] ^{-1}}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we analyze how one can compute higher correlations in the depinning field theory and obtain simple diagrammatic rules for doing so .",
    "these are illustrated on the 4-point function .",
    "specific calculations and results will be given in the next section .",
    "we want to compute at @xmath12 , using the dynamical action @xmath137 in ( [ 3 ] ) , e.g.  the 4-point expectation value , connected w.r.t .",
    "disorder ( and @xmath29 ) as defined in the previous sections : @xmath138 similar formulas hold for higher correlation functions .",
    "this is identical to a connected expectation value w.r.t .",
    "the action @xmath139 , denoted hereafter @xmath140 .",
    "the first step is to show that correlations can all be expressed as : @xmath141 here @xmath142 is the exact response function and @xmath143 the exact effective action ( sum of 1pi graphs ) ( with the choice @xmath144 for the probability and @xmath145 is symmetric ) .",
    "this is the standard relation between connected correlation functions and the effective action ( i.e.  1-particle irreducible vertex functions ivf ) .",
    "the simplification here is that a priori the exact 2-point correlation function and vertices such as @xmath146 could also contribute , but their contribution vanishes for @xmath12 at the depinning threshold .",
    "this is because @xmath147 is time independent there , and then statistical tilt symmetry implies that all ivf s with at least one external @xmath29 leg carrying frequency @xmath148 vanish when this frequency is set to zero ( see section ii a in @xcite ) .",
    "the above formula ( [ lf21 ] ) generalizes straightforwardly to any connected @xmath149-point correlation function of the field @xmath29 in terms of @xmath150 .",
    "next one can compute @xmath151 in perturbation , using the diagrammatic rules for the non - analytic action arising from the expansion ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "let us denote @xmath152 the number of @xmath153 external legs , @xmath154 the number of ( unsplitted ) vertices @xmath61 , @xmath155 the number of internal lines ( response functions ) and @xmath156 the number of ( momentum ) loops",
    ". then one has @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "here one has @xmath159 and thus the lowest order contribution has @xmath160 , @xmath161 , i.e.  it is the 1-loop square ( since two vertices @xmath162 implies @xmath163 and is disconnected , three vertices @xmath164 implies @xmath165 and is 1-particle reducible ) .",
    "the two loop corrections are diagrams with 5 vertices and so on . similarly @xmath166 to",
    "lowest order is the 1-loop @xmath149 polygon diagram .",
    "since two @xmath153 fields must come out ( arrows ) of each vertex , there are four possible diagrams corresponding to the 1-loop square , shown on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "each line entering a vertex corresponds to one derivative of the @xmath35 function of the vertex .",
    "thus from ( [ exp ] ) we see that ( a ) is proportional to @xmath167 , ( b ) and ( c ) to @xmath168 and ( d ) to @xmath169",
    ". however , as we will show below using the so - called mounting property only ( a ) is non - zero .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we found two ways to compute diagram ( a ) ( as well as any other similar diagrams ) , a systematic but complicated way , and a simple way which uses a very important property and not yet fully elucidated of the field theory of depinning , the `` quasistatic property '' described below . to appreciate the extent of the cancellations involved in this drastic simplification , we start by sketching the systematic method .    to perform an actual calculation , since each @xmath60 vertex involves fields at two times , one must switch to the splitted diagrammatics , as described in @xcite .",
    "diagram ( a ) then becomes the sum of 16 splitted diagrams ( two choices per vertex ) represented in fig .",
    "[ ato16 ] .",
    "note that the last one is zero since it involves an acausal loop . that leaves 15 non - zero and non - trivial diagrams .",
    "the last one , which contains an acausal loop and thus vanishes , is added here for future convenience.,title=\"fig : \" ]    these diagrams correspond to the following .",
    "one first expands @xmath170 using ( [ exp ] ) , which gives , schematically : @xmath171 in shorthand notations @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 omitting all space and time integrals . on then carries the wick contractions , yielding @xmath176 @xmath177 is the free response function .",
    "the factor of @xmath178 comes from the two possible time orientations of the loop .",
    "expanding the product of response functions yields the 16 diagrams represented in fig.[ato16 ] , where space and time labels are ordered turning clockwise around the momentum loop .",
    "for illustration let us indicate the full expression of the first diagram in fig.[ato16 ] , in momentum space : @xmath179 with @xmath180 the entering momenta and @xmath181 the free response function . because of the sign functions the evaluation of these integrals , and of the other 14 non - vanishing diagrams is very tedious and was handled using mathematica . adding all diagrams , massive cancellations occur .",
    "the final result is very simple and given below .",
    "let us now explain the simple method and the properties of the theory which lead to it .",
    "the simple way to compute the 4-point correlations ( and higher ones ) at depinning is based on the very important following conjectured property :    all correlation functions @xmath182 computed using the diagrammatic rules of the quasistatic field theory of depinning at zero temperature and exactly at threshold , are * independent of all time arguments*.    using relations such as ( [ lf21 ] ) for arbitrary times shows that an equivalent way to state this property is the following :    all @xmath183 are * independent * of @xmath184 .",
    "this property , which appears as a physical requirement for the correct field theory of depinning , implies non - trivial properties of the diagrammatics .",
    "although we will not attempt to prove it here in full generality , we have checked it on many examples , and believe that it works .",
    "we encourage the reader to contribute a valid proof .",
    "we will however state and prove some easier and useful properties below .",
    "once the properties 1 and 2 are accepted , evaluation of the diagrams drastically simplifies , thanks to the following trick : since the result does not depend on external times , one can take these times mutually infinitely separated , with some fixed ( and arbitrary ) ordering .",
    "then one can integrate easily over all internal times since the order at each vertex is then specified and each sign function has a fixed value .",
    "one recalls that in the splitted diagrammatics all non - vanishing @xmath12 diagrams are _ trees _ ( see section ii a in @xcite ) .",
    "this can be seen on the fifteen non - vanishing diagrams of fig.[ato16 ] . thus integrating independently along each tree starting from the leaves",
    "yields one correlation function per link , since @xmath185 .",
    "performing this calculation on all fifteen diagrams of fig.[ato16 ] shows that they cancel pairwise since they differ only by a global sign , with the exception of the acausal diagram which is zero .",
    "thus the final result is the same as if one had kept only @xmath186 times the acausal graph !    before giving the final result below ,",
    "let us now state the easier properties .",
    "a diagram which contributes to an @xmath29-independent vertex function is 0 if it contains a vertex , into which no response - function enters .",
    "examples are diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this theorem thus ensures that only ( a ) is non - vanishing .",
    "the following figure demonstrates the principle .",
    "note that it may be part of a larger diagram .",
    "especially , there may be more response - functions entering into the upper disorder .",
    "the statement is that @xmath187{./figures / dia1.pdf}{\\hspace*{0.8ex } } }     \\parbox{\\bilderlength}{{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}\\includegraphics[scale={{0.35}}]{./figures / dia1.pdf}{\\hspace*{0.8ex } } } } + {     \\settowidth{\\bilderlength}{{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}\\includegraphics[scale={{0.35}}]{./figures / dia2.pdf}{\\hspace*{0.8ex } } }     \\parbox{\\bilderlength}{{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}\\includegraphics[scale={{0.35}}]{./figures / dia2.pdf}{\\hspace*{0.8ex } } } }   \\right)=0\\ .\\ ] ] since no response - function enters into the lower disorder @xmath188 , due to the assumptions this gives @xmath189 , with no dependence on time .",
