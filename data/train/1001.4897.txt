    "as a fundamental many - body physical model , one - dimensional(@xmath0d ) interacting electron systems are an everlasting research topic .",
    "unlike its high - dimensional counterparts , which are well understood from the quasiparticle picture in the fermi liquid theory,@xcite @xmath0d interacting electron systems can be described by bosonic gapless collective excitations of the fermion density fluctuations within the framework of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory.@xcite    tomonaga - luttinger liquid behaviors in @xmath0d systems have been revealed in measuring the transport properties of cleaved - edge overgrowth quantum wires,@xcite quantum hall systems,@xcite and single - wall carbon nanotubes.@xcite it opens up the possibilities to test some theoretical predictions even in simplified pure physical models , and triggers intensive attention to the physics of the tomonaga - luttinger liquids.@xcite    in mesoscopic fermi - liquid systems , electronic transport is modeled by the transmission of an incident electron through a potential barrier , and the conductance of the system is directly related to the transmission probability.@xcite however , potential barriers play a counterintuitive role in the tomonaga - luttinger liquids . in a seminal paper , kane and fisher@xcite have shown that the barrier is irrelevant for attractive electron - electron interactions , and cuts the system into two pieces for repulsive interactions . in transport measurements , tomonaga - luttinger liquid quantum wires of finite length need to be connected to leads acting as electron reservoirs .",
    "if the reservoirs are modeled as @xmath0d noninteracting systems , then the model of inhomogeneous tomonaga - luttinger liquids with different interaction strengths in different parts is appropriate to investigate the transport properties of the tomonaga - luttinger liquids.@xcite it was argued that the dc conductance is not renormalized by the interactions.@xcite an interesting phenomenon of andreev - like reflections has been shown at the interfaces between the interacting wire and the noninteracting leads due to the mismatch of the interaction strengths.@xcite the presence of an impurity results in interference of the bosonic excitations which can be modulated by an applied bias voltage , and thus leads to characteristic oscillations of the backscattering current as a function of the dc voltage.@xcite feldman et al.@xcite have showed that backscattering off a weak dynamic impurity would enhance the current .",
    "pea et al.@xcite and recher et al.@xcite have demonstrated interesting fabry - perot interference patterns of the non - linear conductance as a function of the bias voltage in carbon nanotubes attached to metallic reservoirs , where backscattering processes mainly occur at the two metal - contact - nanotube interfaces .    in this paper , we investigate interference effects of electron tunneling through double barriers in an interacting quantum wire .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0d interacting electron system is adiabatically attached to two @xmath0d noninteracting electron systems , which act as electron reservoirs .",
    "such an assumption excludes the possibility of backscattering at the interfaces between the interacting and noninteracting segments . backscattering events",
    "take place at the positions of the double barriers .",
    "due to the existence of the andreev - like reflections at the interfaces , electron tunneling through the double barriers in a tomonaga - luttinger - liquid wire is more complicated and thus expected to be more interesting .",
    "as we show later , there exists a contribution from the quantum mechanical interference of bosonic excitations to the backscattering current , besides the contributions from backscattering off the separate barriers .",
    "it is the quantum mechanical interference that dominates the oscillatory characteristics of the backscattering current as a function of the applied bias voltage .",
    "the aim of this work is to make clear how the oscillation pattern of the backscattering current in an interacting quantum wire with double barriers is modulated by the electron interaction strength and the arrangement of the double barriers .",
    "since what we are interested in is the low - temperature transport properties , it is convenient to reformulate the problem in the framework of standard bosonization.@xcite first linearize the energy spectra about the fermi points @xmath11 , and introduce two species of electron operators @xmath12 ) to describe the right - moving and left - moving fermions , then the excitations of the fermion system can be described by a bosonic field @xmath13 . in this way the hamiltonian for the fermion system can be recast in the following bosonic form      where @xmath15^{-1/2}$ ] is the interaction parameter , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the charge density wave velocity .    in terms of the bosonic field @xmath18",
    ", the current operator can be written as @xmath19    the current - bias relations of the nonequilibrium system is of interest , it is appropriate to adopt the keldysh formalism . following the path integral technical procedures developed in ref .",
    "@xmath20 for a static impurity , the average current is obtained @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ total current ] ) , @xmath22 is the background current in the absence of barriers , and @xmath23 is the backscattering current .",
    "the average backscattering current is the sum of three contributions to leading order in @xmath24 ( see appendix )    @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath27/2\\big \\rangle_0 $ ] are the correlation functions of the bosonic field @xmath28 in the clean wire limit .",
    "these correlation functions can be obtained by expanding the bosonic field on the basis of the eigenfunctions , which satisfy a specific inhomogeneous equation.@xcite it is evident that , besides the independent contributions from backscattering by the separate barriers , there exists a quantum mechanical interference contribution to the backscattering current due to the coexistence of double barriers .",
    "it is just such an interference term that gives rise to some interesting transport characteristics in interacting quantum wires with double barriers .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the correlation functions yield a simplified expression @xmath29 ^ 2}{[\\alpha^2+(2\\xi_i+m)^2][\\alpha^2+(2\\xi_j+m)^2 ] } \\big]\\big\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the dimensionless cutoff , with @xmath32 being the inverse of the traversal time of the charge density wave and @xmath33 being the high - energy cutoff frequency , @xmath34 is the andreev - like reflection coefficient at the interfaces .      the above expressions for the backscattering current @xmath41 allow us to evaluate it for arbitrary values of the barrier positions ( @xmath42 ) , the interaction strength @xmath43 , and the applied voltage @xmath44 .",
    "it is noticed that the backscattering current contributed from an individual barrier is dependent on the relative distance of the barrier to the wire center(@xmath45 ) , while that from the quantum mechanical interference term is dependent on the location details of the double barriers(@xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "it seems impossible to obtain an explicit expression for the backscattering current , we resort to numerical calculations to investigate the backscattering current in some typical cases .",
    "first , we investigate the dependence of the backscattering current on the interaction strength .",
    "it is well known that the interaction strength is characterized by the interaction parameter @xmath48^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "we have @xmath49 for repulsive interactions and @xmath50 for noninteracting limit .",
    "it should be noted that the smaller the value of @xmath43 , the stronger the interaction . in fig .",
    "@xmath0 , we present numerical results of @xmath41 as a function of the applied voltage @xmath51 for different typical interaction parameters @xmath52 , as the barriers locate symmetrically near the ends of the wire with @xmath53 .",
    "since the barriers are symmetrically located , the backscattering currents arising from different barriers are the same .",
    "it can be observed that , as the interaction decreases , the oscillation of the incoherent addition of the backscattering currents contributed from the two barriers disappears gradually , while that contributed from the quantum mechanical interference persists and is more prominent .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the backscattering current is mainly determined by the quantum mechanical interference of the bosonic waves backscattering off the double barriers .",
    "we attribute the less pronounced oscillation of the backscattering current in the strong interaction case to the suppression of the quantum mechanical interference by the electron - electron interaction . as shown by dolcini et al .",
    "@xcite , the oscillation of the backscattering current in the single barrier case arises from a combined effect of the barrier , the finite length and the interaction in the wire .",
    "the phase shift of bosonic excitations traveling between the barrier and the interfaces is responsible for such an oscillation and can be modulated by an applied bias voltage . in our case with double barriers , competition between the single - barrier interference and the double - barrier quantum mechanical interference results in an interesting oscillatory behavior of the backscattering current . in the cases of a given barrier location , the oscillation period of the backscattering current contributed from the quantum mechanical interference",
    "is irrespective of the interaction strength , while the oscillation period from the incoherent addition of the backscattering currents off different barriers is increased as the interaction parameter is decreased , and eventually becomes infinite in the noninteracting limit , which can be found in fig . @xmath0 .",
    "then we consider two special cases for strong interaction ( @xmath54 ) where the double barriers locate symmetrically near the midpoint of the interacting wire ( @xmath55 ) and right at the ends of the wire ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "it can be found from fig . @xmath57",
    "that in both cases the backscattering current oscillates in a more pronounced way , compared to the case where the double barriers are located symmetrically near the interfaces ( @xmath53 , fig .",
    "@xmath0 ( a ) ) . in fig .",
    "@xmath57 , we also observe that , the oscillation frequency of the incoherent addition of the backscattering currents off the separate barriers is twice that due to the quantum mechanical interference when the double barriers are located at the ends of the wire , while the two frequencies are about the same when the double barriers are located near the midpoint of the wire .",
    "the reason is that the round - trip ballistic time for bosonic excitations propagating between a barrier and an interface in the former case is twice that in the later case .",
    "up to the present we have analyzed the current - voltage characteristics in cases where the two barriers are symmetrically located .",
    "as the barriers are located asymmetrically , it is expected that such an asymmetry has trivial effects on the current - voltage characteristics of weakly interacting wires , but influences significantly the transport properties of strongly interacting wires . in fig .",
    "@xmath58 , we provide the results of the backscattering current of the interacting wire with symmetric and asymmetric locations of the barriers in both weak interaction(@xmath59 ) and strong interaction(@xmath54 ) cases .",
    "we find that in the weak interaction case , the backscattering currents are about the same for symmetric and asymmetric barrier locations(figs .",
    "@xmath58(a ) and @xmath58(b ) ) , as long as the spacing between the double barriers is fixed .",
    "however , such a scenario is changed in the strong interaction case , where the current oscillation strongly depend on the symmetry of the barrier locations ( figs .",
    "@xmath58(c ) and @xmath58(d ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the period of current oscillation depends strongly on the spacing between the double barriers in the weak interaction limit , i.e. , the bigger the barrier spacing , the smaller the oscillation period .",
    "this phenomenon can not be observed in the strong interaction limit .",
    "we attribute the dependence of the current oscillation on the barrier spacing in the weak interaction limit to the resonant tunneling through a double - barrier structure in one - dimensional noninteracting electronic systems.@xcite in the case of strong interactions , different locations of the barriers lead to different interference patterns for bosonic plamonic excitations traveling between a barrier and the interfaces , and then results in different oscillation behaviors of the backscattering currents contributed from the separate barriers .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that , depending on the interaction strength , the backscattering current exhibits different scaling rules with the applied bias voltage in a finite - length tomonaga - luttinger - liquid wire with double barriers , as can be found from figs .",
    "this observation deserves further investigation .",
    "in summary , we have investigated interference effects in electron transport through a double - barrier structure in an interacting quantum wire , which is ideally attached to two noninteracting leads .",
    "we have found that the oscillation of the backscattering current with the applied voltage is mainly determined by the quantum mechanical interference due to the coexistence of the double barriers .",
    "it is contrast to the single barrier case , where the current oscillation is strongly dependent on the interference of the andreev - like reflected plasmonic excitations propagating between the single barrier and the interfaces .",
    "depending on the interaction strength and the locations of the barriers , the competition between these two kinds of interferences results in different oscillation and scaling behaviors of the backscattering current with the bias voltage .",
