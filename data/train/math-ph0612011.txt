    "causal perturbation theory ( cpt ) goes back to ideas from stueckelberg , rivier and green @xcite , bogoliubov , parasiuk and sirkov @xcite and has been developed by epstein and glaser @xcite and more recently by scharf @xcite . a little after epstein and glaser came formulations @xcite to construct finite gauge theories , based on regulator free momentum substraction schemes . in the last publication",
    "the questions of the finiteness of lorentz - invariant amplitudes and of symmetry conservation are treated seperately . moreover , as opposed to cpt , the importance of causality issues in relation to the finiteness problem itself is not of main concern . in cpt",
    "the @xmath0-matrix is constructed as a formal functional expansion in an unimodular interaction - switching test function .",
    "whereas in the traditional approach the @xmath0-matrix amplitudes are determined by equations of motion , in cpt they are determined inductively by causality conditions imposed on switching test functions .",
    "such causality conditions turn out to be as stringent for the @xmath0-matrix evolution as the equations of motion themselves . on an heuristic level",
    "it may be seen as follows : if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two such switching test functions with supports such that @xmath3 \\in ( -\\infty , s)$ ] and @xmath4 \\in ( s,+\\infty)$ ] respectively , then causality implies that @xmath5 , which is the functional equation for an exponential .",
    "+ the @xmath0-matrix amplitudes are time ordered products of operator valued distributions ( opvd ) .",
    "they are split into causal advanced and retarded pieces , in such a way that any singular behaviour at equal space - time points is avoided .",
    "the procedure has long been recognized as mathematically rigorous @xcite since it is divergence free at each iteration stage .",
    "nevertheless epstein - glaser work almost fell into oblivion among qft practioners mainly because + ( 1 ) in its original version there were difficulties in disentangling the multiplicative structure of renormalization and + ( 2 ) the rise of renormalization group methods turned research interests into this direction .",
    "+    however epstein - glaser approach still enjoys popularity in the world of mathematical physicists dedicated to the construction of a rigorous and mathematically well defined qft @xcite . in this context",
    "the key issue is the extension of singular distributions to the whole space - time manifold . in mathematics a rigorous way to define an extension of a singular distribution is a weighted taylor series surgery : one throws away an appropriate jet of the test function at the singularity and defines the extended distribution by transposition at the level of the functional from the corresponding taylor remainder of the test function . transposed to fourier space",
    "the procedure amounts to a substraction method @xcite which includes bphz renormalization @xcite as a special case . in a minkowskian metric",
    "this is equivalent to the implementation of causality while in its euclidean counterpart it is a symmetry preserving prescription for substractions . in light - front quantum field theory ( lfqft )",
    "there is a compelling reason to introduce test functions related to the consistency of the canonical quantization scheme itself .",
    "it is best seen for the massive scalar field .",
    "the form of the lf - laplace operator leads to a hyperbolic equation of motion which requires initial data on two characteristics .",
    "canonical quantization in terms of initial field values in the light cone time is however possible provided @xcite @xmath6,where @xmath7 is the field amplitude at @xmath8 . with fields as opvd",
    "this relation becomes @xmath9 , which is surely satisfied for the class of test functions @xmath10 used for the fock expansion of the field operators @xcite .",
    "our earlier approach with test functions @xcite in fact implements epstein - glaser treatment of singular distributions in the lfqft context . here",
    "we want to assess our particular choice of test functions as partition of unityand show the resulting simplifications brought about for the treatment of poincar s invariance and for the lorentz invariant taylor series surgeries discussed in @xcite . + in section ii the general definition of fields as opvd is given . due to specific properties of euclidean manifolds",
    "it is shown that the class of admissible test functions can be restricted to a partition of unity , in close analogy with the usual atlas - independent definition of integrals of differential forms .",
    "thus a qft construction is possible , which is test - function independent . as a consequence , for scalar field theory",
    "it is shown that poincar s commutator algebra is fulfilled , in contrast with the case of arbitrary test - functions . in section",
    "iii the bogoliubov - epstein - glaser expansion of the @xmath0-matrix is recalled .",
    "it is given in terms of the interaction - switching test function @xmath11 .",
    "the proper epstein - glaser time ordered construction of the expansion coefficients is described .",
    "the implementation of lorentz covariance of the procedure is presented and the simplifications brought about with test functions vanishing at the origin with all their derivatives are shown .",
    "they concern lorentz covariance , the taylor surgery itself and its interpretation in terms of the bphz renormalisation scheme . in section iv",
    ", the use of lagrange s formula @xcite for taylor s remainder in connection with partition of unity test functions is shown to simplify also the analysis of singular distributions both in the ir and uv domains . a direct application of the method in the ir is shown to be successful for the free massive scalar field theory developed in the ( conventionally hopeless ) mass perturbation expansion .",
    "it should also prove relevant to many problems of massless conformal field theories ( cft ) . finally , following @xcite , in the uv the alternative interpretation of the effects of partition of unity test functions in terms of pauli - villars type subtractions at the level of propagators",
    "is pointed out in euclidean and minskowskian metrics . in section",
    "v epstein - glaser separation method of section iii for distributions into advanced and retarded pieces ( splitting procedure ) is rephrased for the special case of partition of unity test functions .",
    "their use simplifies greatly the derivation of the relation between the splitting procedure and dispersion relations . in section",
    "vi a general discussion is given on the possibility of applying bseg s method in a non - perturbative light front quantization framework and on the benefits one might expect from the procedure .",
    "finally some conclusions are drawn in section vii .",
    "the history of fields as opvd is almost as old as quantum field theory itself .",
    "in fact the mathematical developments of distribution theory ( or generalized functions ) @xcite in the @xmath12 were intimately related to problems raised at that time by pioneers in the qft formulation .",
    "this mutual feedback has lead to qft formulations @xcite in the @xmath13 which aimed at dealing in a mathematically consistent way with intrinsic divergences crippling the usual qft perturbative analysis . among these approaches the work of epstein and glaser @xcite has long been recognized as mathematically rigourous and free of undefined quantities .",
    "it is still generating an important literature in mathematical physics and we shall summerise here some of its recent developments .",
    "+ to introduce fields as opvd one may consider , without loss of generality , the free massive scalar field in d - dimensions .",
    "the general solution of the klein - gordon equation is a distribution , _ ie _ an opvd , which defines a functional with respect to a test function @xmath14 belonging to @xmath15 , the space of schwartz test functions @xcite ,    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is an operator - valued functional with the possible interpretation of a more general functional @xmath18 evaluated at @xmath19 . indeed",
    "the translated functional is a well defined object @xcite such that @xmath20 now the test function @xmath21 has a well defined fourier decomposition @xmath22 it follows that @xmath23 due to the properties of @xmath24 , @xmath25 obeys the kg - equation and is taken as the physical field @xmath26 .",
    "after integration over @xmath27 and with @xmath28 the quantized form is taken as the @xmath29euclidean integral @xmath30.\\ ] ] @xmath31 acts as a regulator @xcite with very specific properties @xcite .",
    "this expression for @xmath26 is particularly useful to define correlation functions of the field and more precisely in the light - cone ( lc ) formalism because the haag series can be used @xcite and is well defined in terms of the product of @xmath32 . in the full euclidean metric",
    "there is no on - shell condition and @xmath26 stays a @xmath33-dimensional fourier transform with @xmath34 only .",
    "+ it might appear that there would be as many qft s as eligible test functions .",
    "however some importants results from topological spaces analysis may be invoked .",
    "some general definitions need first to be recalled : +    definitions : +    \\a ) an open covering of a topological space @xmath35 is a family of open sets @xmath36 such that @xmath37 .",

    "+    \\d ) if @xmath36 is an open covering of @xmath35 , a partition of unity subordinate to @xmath36 is a family @xmath44 of positive continuous functions on @xmath35 such that + ( i ) for all @xmath45 there exists a neighbourhood @xmath46 of @xmath47 such that all but a finite number of the @xmath48 vanish on @xmath46 .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath49 for all @xmath50 + ( iii ) for all @xmath41 , there exists @xmath42 such that the closure of @xmath51 is contained in @xmath52 .",
    "the closure of @xmath51 is called the support of @xmath48 . +    remark : if @xmath53 and @xmath44 are two partitions of unity subordinate to @xmath36 and @xmath40 respectively , @xmath54 is a partition of unity subordinate to @xmath55 . since this property is crucial in the sequel it is established in appendix a.",

    "+    \\b ) if @xmath35 is a connected , paracompact differentiable manifold and @xmath39 is an open covering , then there exists a differentiable partition of unity subordinate to @xmath39 .",
    "+    partitions of unity are useful because one can often use them to extend local constructions to the whole space .",
    "a well known case deals with the definition of integrals of differential forms @xcite : let @xmath56 be a differential form , @xmath57 is used to cut @xmath56 into _ small _ pieces : @xmath58 and @xmath59 . for @xmath60",
    "one defines : @xmath61 . @xmath62",
    "being of compact support each integral in the sum is finite and the overall result is independent of the choice of coordinates ( atlas ) on @xmath63 and of the partition of unity .",

    "+    the metrisable euclidean manifold being paracompact permits the use of partition of unity test functions in the definition of the field of eq.(ii.5 ) .",
    "the resulting operator - valued functional is independent of the way this partition of unity is constructed .",
    "all constructions of the field with different partition of unity are therefore equivalent , thereby eliminating the initial arbitrariness in the choice of test functions .",
    "then @xmath34 is @xmath64 execpt in the boundary region where it is infinitely differentiable and goes to zero with all its derivatives .",
    "an immediate and important consequence of this construction is that all successive convolutions of the field @xmath26 with the test function leave @xmath26 unchanged .",

    "for all other commutators the reduction procedure due to the @xmath76 s and @xmath77 s is the usual one and since any power of the test function is an equivalent partition of unity , the poincar algebra is thereby satisfied .",

    "epstein - glaser analysis focusses then on the solution of this difficulty to which we now turn .      because the functional integration of eq.(ii.1 ) may occur in practice in a space of smaller dimension than the original dimension @xmath33 we shall use @xmath95 as a dimensional label henceforth .",
    "due to translation invariance the multiplication problem just mentionned can be reduced to the study of distributions singular at the origin of @xmath96 .",
    "let then @xmath97 be a @xmath98 test function belonging to @xmath99 and @xmath100 a distribution belonging to @xmath101 which we want to extend to the whole domain @xmath102 .",
    "the singular order @xmath103 of @xmath100 at the origin of @xmath96 is defined as @xmath104 epstein - glaser original extension consists in performing an educatedtaylor surgery on the initial test function by throwing away the weigthed k - jet of @xmath97 at the origin . denoting by @xmath105 this taylor s remainder , this implies @xmath106 here the notations are : @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "they have to do with the splitting procedure of distributions into advanced and retarded parts , lorentz covariance of the epstein - glaser analysis , the connection with bphz renormalization and consequently the analysis of the ir and uv behaviour of the underlerlying qft .",

    "+ the following indentities then hold : @xmath151 these identities can only be used with distributions having causal supports .",
    "otherwise the scalar products @xmath152 would not have a unique sign related to advanced or retarded coordinates and @xmath153 could not be used to distinguish advanced and retarded parts of the supports . for later use",

    "it is the scale @xmath182 present in the srtf which fixes this point .",
    "the calculation of the advanced , extended distribution @xmath329 follows the same lines with a result similar to that of eq.(v.7 ) with @xmath330 .",

    "at various places in the text we commented on the necessity of using test functions when quantizing fields in dirac s front form @xcite . as stated in the introduction the restriction of quantum fields to a lightlike surface does not canonically exist and turns out to be the major mathematical problem to face first in dealing with lfqft .",
    "the question was initially adressed in @xcite and fully discussed in @xcite .",
    "the outcome is the fock expansion of the field operator written in lc - variables with test functions taking proper account of both the lc - induced ir singularity at @xmath336 and of the uv behaviour in @xmath337 . for a scalar field theory",
    "the haag series is well defined in terms of products of free fields and provides a non - perturbative lf - scheme to evaluate physical observables by projection of the equations of motion and constraints on different fock sectors @xcite .",
    "the procedure leads to coupled sets of integral equations for amplitudes in the haag series , presenting non - standard renormalization difficulties common to all lf dynamics approaches @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the unavoidable truncation of the coupled set of equations to a finite number of amplitudes .",
    "this truncation jeopardizes the renormalization procedure unless special attention is given to the scaling behaviour of the neglected contributions .",
    "it appears then that , if the bseg procedure could be applied in the non - perturbative lfqft context , then only finite quantities will occur in the course of calculations and the amplitudes , instead of obeying coupled set of equations , could be determined inductively .",
    "thereby overlapping contributions and the renormalization difficulties mentioned above could be avoided .",
    "an immediate objection is that since the bseg procedure is perturbative in essence it can not fulfil our non - perturbative goals .",
    "however the same objection is also valid for the standard scheme with coupled equations and it is well known that the non - perturbative aspects of lfqft are encoded in the constrained dynamics related to the singular nature of the light front lagrangian . to be specific",
    "consider the standard expression for the s - matrix @xcite @xmath338 where @xmath339 is the interaction hamiltonian and the time ordering is made with @xmath92-functions , albeit the divergences occuring on the light cone when @xmath340 @xcite and subjects of epstein - glaser attention .",
    "the light front is defined by @xmath341 , where @xmath342 is an arbitrary four vector such that @xmath343 .",
    "the expression of eq.(vi.1 ) is then repesented in terms of the light front time @xmath344 for , if @xmath345 , the signs of @xmath346 and @xmath347 are the same provided the time ordering is treated according to the generalized epstein - glaser considerations developped above which eliminates light - cone divergences .",
    "hence @xmath348 , however with important caveats .",
    "we discuss first the case of interacting scalar fields .",
    "obviously the asymptotic states have to be free bosonic fields @xmath349 as defined after eq.(ii.4 ) .",
    "since the lc - lagrangian is singular , the quantization has to follow the specific rules for constrained systems @xcite  . in the present case",
    "it means that in addition to the equation of motion for the particle sector field @xmath26 there exists a constraint which lives only in the zero mode sector and is of nondynamical nature .",
    "if this constraint has a nontrivial solution @xmath350 then the total field @xmath351 is a sum : @xmath352 .",
    "the zero mode field carries the information on nontrivial physics and is the lc - counterpart of a nontrivial vacuum in equal - time quantization .",
    "consequently the field appearing in the interaction @xmath339 is the total field @xmath353 there is , however , a problem which can not be overlooked : the zero mode @xmath350 following from the constraint can only be obtained approximately and recursively in an iterative procedure , which means that the interaction @xmath339 is a priori known only as far as @xmath350 is known .",
    "this was the bad news , shared with alternative formulations such as that of ref.@xcite or the covariant light front dynamics approach of ref.@xcite ; the good news is that , if the coupling is large enough to support a zero mode - or in other words to generate a phase transition - already the first , algebraically very simple iteration step leads to a form for the zero mode giving a value for the critical coupling in good agreement with conventional , much more complex calculations and permitting to discuss the critical behaviour near the phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus there is a good reason to hope that a small number of iteration steps would lead to a proper description of non - perturbative physics .",
    "the presence of zero modes in the field operator does not spoil the causality issues of the theory : causality expressed through the pauli - jordan commutator function makes a statement about the measurability of fields at different space - time points .",
    "since such a statement concerns only the particle sector of the theory , the zero mode contribution is not involved in the causal commutator .",
    "+ in fermionic theories the particle sector itself is split into a sum of independent and dependent degrees of freedom which leads -in gauge theories- to additional interactions .",
    "the zero mode problem concerns the gauge field itself and interaction terms built out of primary fermionic fields and behaving like scalar fields . + the validation of these ideas in lfqft gauge theories are undoubtly challenging . already yang - mills theories have been investigated in some details within the standard cpt framework @xcite , paving the way to the implementation of the cpt - lfqft studies .",
    "they will be of considerable theoretical and even practical interests since the outcome is a rigourous non - perturbative alternative to lattice calculations , enjoying the numerous benefits of an lfqft formulation put foreward for decades @xcite .",
    "our concerns in this paper were twofold .",
    "first to define in a mathematically consistent way quantum fields as operator valued distributions , focussing on the specific test functions needed to achieve a generic qft description preserving basic poincar and lorentz invariances . in keeping with the general analysis of integrals of differential forms",
    "the necessary test functions take the form of partition of unity constructed from super regular building blocks on compact subspaces .",
    "the second goal , related to the analysis of divergences crippling the usual pertubative qft approach , was to show , following epstein and glaser analysis , the role of a proper treatment of causality in extensions of singular distributions .",
    "these extensions can be performed very elegantly with lagrange s integral kernel representation combined with super regular test functions , for which the lagrange remainder of any order is identical to the test function itself .",
    "the flexibility in the construction of the test functions allows to treat ir- and uv - divergent distributions with the same mathematical techniques . by the very nature of the construction an arbitrary scale , characterising the building blocks of the decomposition of unity , comes naturally into the picture .",
    "such a scale is the corner stone permitting the use of extended distributions in renormalization group studies .",
    "another important aspect of the decomposition of unity concept for the construction of the test functions is that it does not violate gauge invariance - contrary to other test function methods . a first treatment @xcite in the qed context verifies this for the polarisation tensor in dimension @xmath254 and gives fujikawa s analysis of the axial anomaly in dimensions @xmath271 directly from the presence of the test function as partiton of unity .",
    "a general analysis of gauge invariance is given in @xcite and should be further developped in the present context . in coordinate space",
    "the extended distribution differs from the original singular distribution only on the support of the singularity whereas in momentum space it differs from the original one by subtractions at points determined by the intrinsic scale of the test function .",
    "+ finally we presented arguments , based on the recent developments of epstein - glaser causal approach , which make it extremely plausible that a finite symmetry - preserving lcqft could be envisaged on the basis of an iterative construction of the @xmath0-matrix and a causality conditioned finite regularization using the opvd treatments of fields .",
