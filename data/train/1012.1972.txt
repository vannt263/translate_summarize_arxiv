    "although opaque to optical light , the dusty universe is transparent to radiation at radio wavelengths , thus making the spectroscopic study of the 21-cm spin - flip transition of neutral hydrogen ( ) a very useful tool in probing the far reaches of the cosmos .",
    "the low probability of the transition compounded by the inverse square law , renders  21-cm currently undetectable in emission at redshifts of @xmath4 .",
    "however , in the absorption of radio waves emitted from background quasars , the line strength depends only upon the column density of the absorber and the flux of the background source . therefore by using absorption lines , we can in principal probe  to redshifts of @xmath5 ( or when the universe was 1% its present age ) , where the ionosphere begins to affect low frequency radio waves ( @xmath6 mhz ) . with such observations we can address several outstanding questions in cosmology and fundamental physics :    1 .   probe the epoch of re - ionisation  when the first ever stars ignited , re - ionising the gas in the smaller cosmos ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   determine the contribution of the neutral gas content to the mass density of the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   measure any putative variations in the values of the fundamental constants of nature at large look - back times , to at least an order of magnitude the sensitivity provided by the best optical data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this offers one of the few experimental tests of current grand unified theories , thus having profound implications for modern physics .",
    "this latter point requires the comparison of the redshift of the 21-cm line with other transitions , which may be optical / ultra - violet [ from singly - ionised metals , giving @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , @xmath9 the electron - to - proton mass ratio and @xmath10 the proton g - factor , millimetre - wave [ rotational transition of molecules , giving @xmath11 or other decimetre transitions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "specifically , transitions arising from the hydroxyl radical ( oh ) , which can also be intra - compared @xcite , thus avoiding possible line - of - sight effects which could mimic a change in the constants .    thus , highly redshifted  21-cm and",
    "oh 18-cm absorbers are of great interest , although these are currently very rare , with only 73  21-cm absorption systems at @xmath12 known  41 of which occur in galaxies intervening the sight - lines to more distant quasars ( see table 1 of @xcite ) , with the remainder arising in the host galaxies of the quasars themselves ( see table 1 of @xcite ) . in the case of oh ,",
    "the situation is more dire with only five absorbers currently known @xcite .",
    "four of these were originally found through millimetre - wave molecular absorption , although further surveys have proven fruitless ( see @xcite ) , which we suggest is due to the traditional optical selection of the sources : the target of choice in many previous surveys have been damped lyman-@xmath8 absorption systems ( dlas ) , since these are known to contain large columns of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath13 @xmath14 , by definition ) at precisely determined redshifts .",
    "although 19 dlas have been detected in the  lyman and werner uv bands ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , these are at molecular fractions well below the detection thresholds of current microwave instruments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the molecular abundances appear to be correlated with the colour of the background quasar in that the dlas have molecular fractions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whereas the millimetre ( and oh ) absorbers have molecular fractions @xmath17 and optical  near - infrared colours of @xmath18 ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "that is , not only are the radio - band absorbers redder than those of the optical - band , but there may be a correlation between the normalised oh line strength and optical  near infrared colour ( @xcite ) , although this requires a larger number of detections for confirmation .",
    "these points strongly suggest that the quasar light is reddened by the dust in the foreground absorber , which prevents the dissociation of the molecules by the ambient uv field . from this",
    "it is apparent that in order to detect redshifted molecular absorption with current radio instruments , targets must be selected on the basis of their optical and near - ir photometry , where we select the reddest objects .",
    "however , the obscuration responsible for the quasar reddening could be located anywhere between us and the quasar redshift ( the three intervening systems are the strongest absorbers , see sect .",
    "[ ohr ] ) and , although wide - band decimetre scans are more efficient than at millimetre wavelengths @xcite , these are very susceptible to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) . therefore ,",
    "in addition to our programme of using the wide - band spectrometer on the green bank telescope ( gbt ) to perform 200 mhz wide frequency scans of the entire redshift space towards very red , radio - loud objects ( see @xcite ) , we are searching for  and oh absorption associated with the host galaxy of the quasar . here",
    "we add the results of our recently completed searches for associated absorption and discuss these in the context of our previous search results @xcite .",
    "we observed five sources with the effelsberg telescope and eleven with the green bank telescope ( with two sources , 1107187 & 1504166 , common to both , table [ obs ] ) , where the  21-cm or oh 18-cm transition fell into an available receiver band .",
    "these targets were originally intended to form part of the sample of @xcite and , as such , our targets are largely from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs , @xcite ) .",
    "these are bright and generally compact radio sources for which there exists comprehensive optical photometry @xcite . from a list of sources , for which the redshifted  and oh frequencies fell into the available bands , we targetted a specific sub - sample for each telescope :    1 .   for the effelsberg telescope ,",
    "our targets were selected on the basis of their having a `` type-2 '' spectrum , with narrow emission lines , a red continuum and only weak ( if any ) broad emission line components .",
    "for these , unified schemes of agn imply that our line - of - sight to the nucleus is blocked by a `` dusty torus '' ( which obscures the broad line region and only allows us to view the narrow emission lines directly ) , through which we may expect to detect absorption .",
    "we therefore selected three radio galaxies ( 0114 + 074 , 0454 + 066 & 1555140 ) which exhibit optical spectra with narrow emission lines only , indicating the presence of some nuclear extinction .",
    "however , as since shown by @xcite , agn type has little bearing on whether absorption is detected ( see sect .",

    "fourteen of the sources searched in oh had useful data , although only two of these have 21-cm detections , thus being able to yield limits on the normalised line strengths . adding those from the literature , gives a total of eight objects for which we can normalise the line strengths and thus compare with the five known oh absorbers .",
    "on this basis , however , we find that only two ( 0108 + 388 & 0500 + 019 , both from this paper ) come close to having been searched deeply enough .",
    "this confirms the findings of @xcite that many of the known objects are simply not `` red enough '' to indicate sufficiently large columns of dust , conducive to the presence of molecular gas , along their sight - lines .",

    "<S> we also obtain four non - detections , although , as confirmed by the equipartition of detections between the type-1 and type-2 objects , this near-50% detection rate can not be attributed to unified schemes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of our detections are at redshifts of @xmath1 , which , in conjunction with our faint source selection , biases against uv luminous objects . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of ultra - violet luminosity ( over agn type ) in the detection of 21-cm is further supported by the non - detections in the two high redshift ( @xmath2 ) radio galaxies , which are both type-2 objects , while having @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our 21-cm detections in combination with those previously published , give a total of eight ( associated and intervening )  absorbing sources searched and undetected in oh . using the detected 21-cm line strengths to normalise the limits , we find that only two of these eight may have been searched sufficiently deeply in oh , although even these are marginal .    </S>",
