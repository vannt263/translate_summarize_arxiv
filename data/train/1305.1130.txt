    "entanglement is a key resource facilitating a wide range of emerging quantum technologies , such as quantum computing  @xcite , communication  @xcite and sensing  @xcite .",
    "it has been well established theoretically  @xcite and experimentally demonstrated between various particles , including photons , atoms and ions  @xcite .",
    "entanglement between two particles  @xcite has been routinely prepared and used in different physical systems for a variety of tasks  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to make full use of the power of entanglement for quantum technologies and to probe deeper into the foundations of quantum mechanics , there has been an increasing push toward making larger numbers of particles entangled with each other . as the number of particles increases beyond two ,",
    "different types of entangled states that can not be converted into each other using local operations and classical communication  ( locc )  @xcite emerge .",
    "greenberger - horne - zeilinger  ( ghz )  @xcite , cluster  @xcite , dicke  @xcite and w states  @xcite , are examples of such inequivalent classes .",
    "dicke states in particular provide a rich variety of structurally complex states among many particles and hold great promise for a wide range of applications in quantum information .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the generation of these states in physical systems such as ion traps  @xcite , all - optical setups  @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamic settings  @xcite . despite these impressive demonstrations ,",
    "the complexity of dicke states makes their preparation and manipulation difficult .",
    "thus , understanding the limits for preparing and manipulating large multipartite entangled versions are of great interest and urgently needed .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the minimal number of qubits that it is necessary to have access to in order to expand and reduce any given dicke state .",
    "we show that , unlike w  @xcite , ghz and cluster states  @xcite , dicke states in general can not be transformed by local access to only a single qubit .",
    "we consider gates for transforming dicke states by minimal access . in the case of the expansion of w states , by accessing only one qubit there is a universal optimal gate which can expand any size of w state with maximum success probability .",
    "similarly to this case , we derive a universal optimal gate which adds either spin - up or spin - down qubits to dicke states by minimal access .",
    "we then construct universal gates which can add or subtract given numbers of spin - up and spin - down qubits with a nonzero success probability , regardless of the size of an initial dicke state .",
    "our work has important implications for assessing the amount of control one needs in the preparation and manipulation of dicke states in physical systems for a range of quantum information applications , such as quantum algorithms  @xcite , quantum games  @xcite , testing efficient tomographic techniques  @xcite and multi - agent quantum networking  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-qubit dicke state with @xmath1 excitations is the equally weighted superposition of all permutations of @xmath0-qubit product states with @xmath1 spin - up  ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 spin - down  ( @xmath4 ) , and is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 with @xmath7 for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a projector onto the symmetric subspace with respect to the permutation of any two particles .",
    "for example , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "( [ eq : dicke1 ] ) describes general symmetric dicke states and the theory we develop covers this entire class .    0.5 cm    we assume that @xmath14 is shared between two physical subsystems a and b , and denote this as @xmath15 , with subsystem a holding a total of @xmath16 qubits and subsystem b holding the remaining qubits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : img ]  ( a ) . here",
    "we derive the minimum number @xmath16 of qubits that it is necessary to have access to in order to transform the state @xmath15 into a state @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total number of qubits added for @xmath19 and deleted for @xmath20 , and similarly @xmath21 is the added or deleted number of qubits in @xmath2 , while @xmath22 represents the added or deleted number of qubits in @xmath4 . for the trivial cases of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the states of system ab are product states @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in the following , we will study only the nontrivial cases where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we consider a local transformation scenario in which access to subsystem b is forbidden , and the transformation task is carried out by collectively manipulating the @xmath16 qubits of subsystem a only  [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : img ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "this limited - access scenario allows us to investigate the requirements for the number of qubits that one would need control over in a given physical system . in this scenario ,",
    "the whole system after the transformation is composed of @xmath31 qubits in subsystem b and @xmath32 qubits in subsystem a. thus , we have @xmath33 , namely @xmath34 is necessary . in other words , the new total number of qubits must be at least as big as the number of qubits in subsystem b to which access is forbidden .",
    "we now derive a necessary condition for the transformation of dicke states .",
    "when we consider the superposition of pure product states for the dicke state in the computational basis , the minimum number of spin - up qubits in subsystem b is obtained by maximizing the number of spin - up qubits in subsystem a , and is given by @xmath35 for the initial dicke state @xmath14 and @xmath36 for the final dicke state @xmath37 . since subsystem b",
    "is left untouched in the transformation , the minimum number of spin - up qubits can not decrease in subsystem b. however it may increase , for example if qubits are deleted from subsystem a. thus , the relation @xmath38 should hold .",
    "this means that @xmath39 is a necessary condition for the transformation with @xmath40 .",
    "since a similar argument holds for the transformation with @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 as a necessary condition for transforming a dicke state to another dicke state . in other words , for spin - down ( spin - up ) qubits to be added , the necessary condition is that the number of qubits in subsystem a must be at least as big as the number of spin - up ( spin - down ) qubits in the total system . note that for other cases , we have @xmath43 this is a trivial condition that the number of qubits in subsystem a should be at least as big as the total number of qubits being deleted .",
    "here we show that conditions  ( [ eq : kcondition ] ) and  ( [ eq : k3 ] ) are sufficient conditions for transformation of a dicke state to another dicke state for any given physical system , and we derive the maximum probability for the transformation .",
    "we first decompose the dicke state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dicke1 ] ) by using the symmetric bases in subsystems a and b. when we expand @xmath44 in the computational basis , it is given by the sum of @xmath45 terms with unit amplitude . from these terms , we select those that have @xmath46 spin - up qubits in subsystem b. the sum of these selected terms is given by @xmath47 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath48 , where the range of the summation over @xmath46 is given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 is calculated using similar methods to the derivation of @xmath51 . using this decomposition , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : dicke1 ] ) as @xmath52    in the following , we treat the case with @xmath53 and the case with @xmath54 separately . in each case , assuming the conditions ( [ eq : kcondition ] ) and ( [ eq : k3 ] ) , we show that the transformation is optimally achievable at a nonzero probability @xmath55 .    for @xmath56 , decomposition of the desired state @xmath17 obtained from the transformation is @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "again , @xmath60 is calculated similarly to @xmath61 .",
    "since access is allowed only to subsystem a , the marginal state in subsystem b does not change through the transformation process , which implies the relation @xmath62 must hold . here",
    "@xmath63 is the success probability of the transformation and @xmath64 is the state of subsystem b when the transformation fails . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dec1 ] ) , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are diagonalized by the basis @xmath67 .",
    "thus , from the positivity of @xmath64 , we have @xmath68 , where @xmath69",
    "with @xmath70 and @xmath71 here it should be understood that @xmath72 , and @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . since we are assuming conditions ( [ eq : kcondition ] ) and ( [ eq : k3 ] ) , we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 , resulting in @xmath78 . under these conditions ,",
    "we construct a gate @xmath79 which achieves the upper bound on the success probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) .",
    "the gate @xmath79 is composed of a success operator @xmath80 and a failure operator @xmath81 satisfying @xmath82 .",
    "we define @xmath80 by @xmath83 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qmin0 ] ) and ( [ eq : qj ] ) , no coefficients of @xmath84 are larger than @xmath85 , and thus @xmath79 is a valid measurement process for any given physical system . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dec1])-([eq : pmax ] ) and ( [ eq : ms ] ) , we have @xmath86 . as a result , for @xmath53 , the maximum probability of the transformation is given by @xmath55 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) , which is nonzero when conditions ( [ eq : kcondition ] ) and ( [ eq : k3 ] ) hold . for the case of @xmath54 ,",
    "condition ( [ eq : kcondition ] ) implies @xmath87 and @xmath88 because @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath41 .",
    "thus the desired state after the transformation is @xmath92 . from the relation @xmath93 and the positivity of @xmath64 , we have @xmath68 , where @xmath55 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and is strictly positive .",
    "in such a case , the success operator for the gate @xmath79 which achieves the upper bound on the success probability is defined by @xmath96 which is a linear functional but we denote it as a linear operator for convenience . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dec1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ms2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath97 . we thus conclude that conditions ( [ eq : kcondition ] ) and ( [ eq : k3 ] ) are sufficient for the transformation , and the maximum success probability is given by @xmath55 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) .",
    "a w state is a special case of dicke states with only one excitation @xmath98 , _ i.e. _ @xmath99 , recently generated in ion trap  @xcite , photonic  @xcite and cavity settings  @xcite .",
    "when we expand a w state , a universal optimal gate @xmath79 which achieves the expansion to @xmath100  ( @xmath40 ) by accessing only one qubit is constructed as @xmath101 . the expansion can be done regardless of the size of the w state as @xmath102 with success probability @xmath103 , which coincides with @xmath55 calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) , ( [ eq : qmin0 ] ) and ( [ eq : qj ] ) for any @xmath0 .    here",
    "we show that such a universal optimality is partially generalized to dicke states under the following conditions : ( a ) the gate increases at most one type of spin , and ( b ) the gate accesses the minimum number of qubits to achieve the transformation",
    ".    for a gate with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , condition  ( b ) means that @xmath95 . then the gate shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms2 ] ) achieving @xmath55 only depends on @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "thus it works as a universal optimal gate for any input with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which is a trivial condition that the number of spin - up ( spin - down ) qubits in the input state is at least as big as the number of spin - up ( spin - down ) qubits to be deleted .    in the case of @xmath90 , @xmath105 , and @xmath110 , _",
    "i.e. _ adding only spin - down qubits by minimal access , we have @xmath111 , and @xmath112 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qj ] ) satisfies @xmath113 for @xmath114  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath115 from definition  ( [ eq : pmax ] ) .",
    "we give an explicit construction of a universal optimal gate @xmath116 which transforms a dicke state @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "the gate is characterized by the three parameters @xmath119 , @xmath106 and @xmath16 , namely @xmath120 .",
    "the gate @xmath116 is a measurement represented by a success operator @xmath121 and a failure operator @xmath122 , and we define @xmath123 by @xmath124 since @xmath125 and @xmath126 , either @xmath127 or @xmath128 holds . together with @xmath129 , we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dec1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ms0 ] ) that @xmath130 for any dicke state @xmath131 .",
    "thus the gate @xmath116 is the universal optimal gate for transforming dicke states with minimal access of qubits for @xmath40 and @xmath132 .    in the case of @xmath41 , @xmath104 and @xmath133 , _",
    "i.e. _ adding only spin - up qubits by minimal access , we can also construct a universal optimal gate by using the symmetry between @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us define a new operator @xmath134 by interchanging the definition of @xmath4 and @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms0 ] ) , namely , replacing @xmath106 by @xmath119 and @xmath135 by @xmath136 . after rewriting the parameter @xmath46 by @xmath137 ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath138 by symmetry , the gate @xmath139 defined by @xmath134 and @xmath140 achieves the optimal success probability @xmath55 when it is applied to @xmath141 .",
    "here we derive universal gates @xmath142 which transform all dicke states @xmath15 satisfying the conditions on @xmath143 and @xmath1 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kcondition ] ) and ( [ eq : k3 ] ) to @xmath17 with nonzero success probabilities . for @xmath95 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , it is easy to see that the gate defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms2 ] ) is a universal gate for any dicke state satisfying @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in the following ,",
    "we therefore consider the case for @xmath53 .",
    "we define the success operator of the gate by @xmath144 and define the failure operator by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 here the positivity comes from @xmath149 , implying that @xmath150 and @xmath151 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : msi ] ) , by substituting @xmath152 , and relabelling @xmath153 as @xmath46 , @xmath154 is rewritten as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ms ] ) and ( [ eq : msi2 ] ) , @xmath154 only differs from @xmath80 by the overall factor @xmath158 and the range of the summation over @xmath46 . because @xmath159 , @xmath59 and @xmath160 , either @xmath161 or @xmath162 is satisfied .",
    "similarly , because @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , either @xmath166 or @xmath167 is satisfied . as a result we have @xmath168 from @xmath169 , the success probability of the transformation is @xmath170 . from @xmath171 , we see that the transformation succeeds with a nonzero probability whenever @xmath172 .    for convenience , we classify the universal gates into four cases according to the signs of @xmath119 and @xmath106 , and show the range of applicable input dicke states @xmath173 for each case in fig .",
