    "a number of optical and magneto - optical processes running at interaction of a narrow - band laser radiation with atomic vapors are employed in laser technology , metrology , designing of high - sensitivity magnetometers , problems of quantum communications , information storage etc @xcite .",
    "as known , the energy levels of atoms undergo frequency shifts and changes in their transition probabilities in an external magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the related effects were studied for hyperfine ( hf ) atomic transitions in optical domain for the transmission spectra obtained with an ordinary cm - size cell containing rb and cs vapor in @xcite . however , because of doppler broadening ( hundreds of mhz ) , it was possible to partially separate different hf transitions only for @xmath6 g. note that even for these large @xmath1 values the lines of the @xmath7rb and the @xmath8rb are strongly overlapped , and pure isotopes should be used to avoid complicated spectra . in order to eliminate the doppler broadening , the well - known saturation absorption ( sa ) technique was implemented to study the rb hf transitions @xcite . however , in this case the complexity of the zeeman spectra in a magnetic field arises primarily from the presence of strong crossover resonances , which are also split into many components .",
    "that is why , the sa technique is applicable only for @xmath9 g. another significant disadvantage is the fact that the sa is strongly nonlinear and , therefore , the peak amplitudes of the decreased absorption do not correspond to probabilities of atomic transitions at frequencies of which these peaks are formed .",
    "this additionally complicates the processing of the spectra .",
    "the crossover resonances can be eliminated with selective reflection spectroscopy @xcite , but to correctly determine the hf transition position , the spectra must undergo further non - trivial processing .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the use of resonance fluorescence spectra of a ntc filled with rb atomic vapor and having a thickness of @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 nm is the wavelength of laser radiation whose frequency is resonant to the atomic transition of the @xmath5 line of rb ) allows one to separate and to study the atomic transitions between the levels of the hyperfine structure of the @xmath5 line of the @xmath8rb atoms in magnetic fields with @xmath12 g. the achieved high sub - doppler spectral resolution is caused by the effect of a strong narrowing of the fluorescence spectrum of a ntc with the atomic vapor column thickness @xmath13 . with the proper choice of the laser intensity and ntc temperature , it is possible to achieve an eightfold narrowing of the spectrum compared to that in ordinary @xmath14 cm - long cells ( for which the doppler width is about 500 mhz ) .",
    "the method was called `` half - lambda zeeman technique '' ( hlzt ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath15 lines of rb and cs atoms were studied using hlzt in magnetic fields of about 50 g. recently it has been shown that the use of the hlzt allows one to perform detailed quantitative measurements of both frequency characteristics and probabilities of large number of atomic transitions between levels of the hyperfine structure of the rb @xmath5 line in magnetic fields ranging within 10  2500 g @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is described a technique based on the use of spectrally - narrow ( close to natural line - width ) velocity selective optical pumping ( vsop ) resonances peaks appearing at laser intensities @xmath16 mw/@xmath17 exactly at the positions of atomic transitions in the transmission spectrum of the ntc with the rb vapor column thickness of @xmath4 ( @xmath0 being the wavelength of laser radiation resonant with rb @xmath5 or @xmath15 atomic lines , 794 or 780 nm ) .",
    "each vsop resonance is split in an external magnetic field into several zeeman components , the number of which depends on the quantum numbers @xmath18 of the lower and upper levels .",
    "the amplitudes of these components and their frequency positions depend unambiguously on @xmath1-field . hence , with the use of lzt it is also possible to study not only the frequency shift of any individual hf zeeman transition , but also the modification in transition probability .",
    "the efficiency of lzt has been proved in the region of 1 - 2500 g @xcite . among the most interesting results obtained through hlzt and lzt implementation are vanishing of some of atomic transitions for specific @xmath1-field strength , and the appearance of @xmath19 transitions , which are forbidden for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the line intensity of a forbidden transition for some value of magnetic field can be higher than that for strong atomic transitions when @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to note that lzt could have several advantages as compared with the hlzt : in particular , the spectral width of vsop resonances used in lzt is at least 4 times narrower than that used in hlzt , resulting in much higher resolution ; also the laser power required for lzt is @xmath16 times lower than that needed for hlzt ; and finally , recording of resonant transmission spectra does not require sensitive detectors as in the case of fluorescence spectra .",
    "the aim of the work is to demonstrate that lzt can also be successfully used for even higher external magnetic fields up to 5000 g. possible applications of lzt for diagnostics and mapping of large magnetic gradients and for making widely tunable compact frequency references are addressed too .",
    "the first design of the ntc ( called extremely thin cell ) consisting of windows and a vertical side - arm ( a metal reservoir ) , was presented in @xcite .",
    "later , this design was somewhat modified and a typical example of recent version is presented in @xcite . the photograph of the ntc with smoothly variable thickness wedged in the vertical direction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntc ] .",
    "the wedged gap in this case was formed using a platinum spacer strip of 2 @xmath22 m thickness .",
    "the presented ntc has garnet windows of 0.8 mm thickness ( the use of thin wafers in some cases is more convenient ) , and in order to increase the wafers thickness at the bottom to fit the side - arm ( @xmath23 2 mm ) , two additional garnets plates are glued to the main wafers .",

    "the temperature limit of the ntc operation is 400 @xmath27c .",
    "the ntc operated with a specially designed oven with two ports for laser beam transmission .",
    "the source temperature of the atoms of the ntc was 120 @xmath27c , corresponding to the vapor density @xmath28@xmath29 , but the windows were maintained at a temperature that was 20 @xmath27c higher .",

    "it is important to note that the use of the ntc allows one to apply very strong magnetic fields using widely available strong permanent ring magnets ( prm ) : in spite of strong inhomogeneity of magnetic field ( in our case it can reach 150 g / mm ) , the variation of @xmath1-field inside atomic vapor column is @xmath44 g , i.e. by several orders less than the applied @xmath1 value , thanks to small thickness of the ntc ( @xmath45 nm ) .",

    "earlier , in @xcite the longitudinal dimension of the oven was 4 cm resulting in the maximum attainable strength of 2500 g. a new oven was developed specially for high @xmath1-field applications , with the longitudinal dimension of @xmath49 cm .",

    "the vsop peaks of reduced absorption are exactly at the atomic transitions , and these vsops are split into several new components , the number of which depends on the quantum numbers @xmath18 of the lower and upper levels , while the amplitudes of the components and their frequency positions depend on @xmath1-field .",
