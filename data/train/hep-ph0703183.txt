    "leptogenesis@xcite is a simple mechanism to generate baryon number asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the idea is that a lepton asymmetry produced at a high temperature is converted to the baryon asymmetry through the sphaleron interactions@xcite which conserve @xmath1 number but break @xmath2 number .",
    "a simplest version of the leptogenesis is based on the seesaw mechanism@xcite which can also explain the smallness of the neutrino masses by introducing heavy right - handed neutrinos ( rhn ) to the standard model . in the seesaw models , the cp - violating and out - of - equilibrium decay of the rhn can produce the lepton asymmetry .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is also easy to be implemented in supersymmetric and/or grand unified theories ( guts ) which are most attractive candidates for the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "in such a class of model , the successful leptogenesis is considered as a mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe . however , in many models especially in gut models , the mass ( @xmath3 ) of the lightest rhn ( @xmath4 ) is too small to generate the observed baryon asymmetry by the @xmath4 decay and the asymmetry should be produced through another mechanism .",
    "recently it is pointed out that flavor effects give significant contributions to the leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena in the flavored leptogenesis is that the primordial lepton asymmetry generated by the decay of the second lightest rhn ( @xmath5 ) , of the inflaton or so can remain against the washout by the lightest one@xcite .",
    "this is an interesting possibility to give enough baryon asymmetry even when the mass of the lightest rhn is too small .",
    "in such a scenario , the study of the washout effect by the lightest rhn is very important .    in this paper",
    ", we study the detail of this flavored washout effect due to the lightest rhn and we point that there is a novel parameter region where an effect that is negligible in most cases plays an important role .",
    "this effect is due to off - diagonal elements of the so - called a - matrix , and thus unique in the flavored leptogenesis .",
    "most recently , the effects of the off - diagonal elements are studied numerically in the context that @xmath4 decay generates the lepton asymmetry@xcite . here",
    ", we adapt the analysis on the washout effect to the case where the asymmetry produced by the @xmath5 decay dominates the baryon asymmetry of the universe , and show that a sizable lepton asymmetry can remain against the washout process in a different way from those studied in refs.@xcite .    in the section 2 ,",
    "we investigate the washout effect by the @xmath4 decay , assuming that there is primordial lepton asymmetry before the decay becomes relevant . in the section 3",
    ", we will show examples that the primordial asymmetry is generated by the decay of the second lightest rhn .",
    "the section 4 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in the seesaw mechanism , rhns are introduced to the standard model , @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 being rhns , lepton doublets , and higgs doublet respectively . here",
    "we take the basis where the yukawa matrix for charged leptons and the mass matrix of rhns are diagonalized . integrating out the heavy rhns and giving the vev to higgs ,",
    "one can obtain the neutrino masses , @xmath10 , and pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix@xcite , @xmath11 , as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the higgs vev . supposing the reheating temperature after the inflation is enough high , the rhns are produced through the interaction with the doublet leptons and the higgs fields .",
    "when the temperature decreases down to the mass of rhn , the production becomes inefficient and rhns decay away .",
    "this out - of - equilibrium decay of the rhns generates @xmath1 asymmetry which is proportional to the cp violation in the decay , @xmath14 , defined as @xmath15 this asymmetry is converted to the baryon asymmetry through the electroweak sphaleron@xcite processes .      in order to evaluate the baryon asymmetry of the universe , the boltzmann equation is used . in this analysis , for simplicity",
    ", we omit the scattering effects which are considered to be subdominant .",
    "the decays and inverse decays , @xmath16 , are considered with rate @xmath17 . with this simplification ,",
    "the evolution of the asymmetry of @xmath18 after the decoupling of the second lightest rhn is described by the following set of boltzmann equations@xcite : @xmath19 } } , \\label{boltzmanneqb - l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicate the number density of the particle @xmath24 divided by the entropy density @xmath25 and its value in equilibrium respectively , and @xmath26 . the parameter @xmath27 is the total effective number of the degrees of freedom ( dof ) at the temperature around @xmath3 . with these definitions ,",
    "we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the riemann s zeta function and @xmath30 is the modified bessel function . here , @xmath31 is ( not effective ) number of dof of the particle @xmath24 , for example @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    after neglecting the finite temperature effects such as the thermal masses and running of the couplings ( for these effects , see ref.@xcite ) for simplicity , one can obtain @xmath34 and the hubble parameter @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total decay width of @xmath4 and @xmath38 is the planck scale .",
    "now , let us define the `` washout mass parameter '' @xmath39 and `` equilibrium neutrino mass parameter '' @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 . the partial decay width to a flavor @xmath43",
    "is written as @xmath44 and the total decay width is given by the sum of them @xmath45 .",
    "eventually , the boltzmann equations are written as@xmath46}}. \\label{boltzmanneqb - l1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient of @xmath47 is different from that in ref.@xcite by a factor @xmath48 which comes from the relative factor of the number density in the equilibrium of fermion / boson ( [ yeq ] ) .",
    "notice that , however , in the derivation of the boltzmann equations ( [ boltzmanneqn ] ) and ( [ boltzmanneqb - l ] ) , an approximation @xmath49 is made . within this approximation",
    ", the relative factor @xmath48 ( and the factor @xmath50 in eq.([mu2y ] ) ) disappears .",
    "in fact the right hand side of eq.([boltzmanneqb - l ] ) is originally written in terms of not @xmath51 but the chemical potentials of the particle @xmath24 , @xmath52 . in literatures ,",
    "these chemical potentials are replaced as eq.([boltzmanneqb - l ] ) using the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath51 with the approximation .",
    "if one would not use this replacement , a factor 1/2 appears instead of 3/4 .",
    "this difference of the factor does not affect the results a lot in many cases and the term of @xmath47 itself is often neglected . in our analysis",
    ", the contribution can affect the result significantly . in the following we take basically the factor 3/4 for illustration .",
    "it is straightforward to make analyses with a different factor .",
    "an important point is that @xmath53 is invariant under the standard evolution of the universe and related to the present baryon asymmetry as @xmath54@xcite can be somewhat different , for instance @xmath55@xcite , depending on the timing of the freeze out of the electroweak sphaleron , but in any case , the value is approximately equal to @xmath56 .",
    "] at the weak scale due to the electroweak sphaleron process .",
    "thus , we define `` baryon asymmetry '' by multiplying the factor @xmath57 on @xmath53 even at a higher temperature .",
    "because this value is proportional to the present baryon to photon ratio as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the present total effective number of dof , successful leptogenesis scenario should predict the `` baryon asymmetry '' @xmath60 which comes from the observable @xmath61@xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction , in some models ,",
    "the cp violation @xmath62 is too small to produce enough lepton asymmetry . in this case",
    "we can neglect the source term .",
    "then , the evolution of @xmath53 is controlled by one equation as @xmath63    note that we assume that the asymmetries of the lepton doublet , @xmath64 , and of the higgs fields , @xmath65 , are much smaller than 1 and thus neglect the higher terms because it is proportional to the @xmath1 asymmetry , as shown below .",
    "these relations are forced by the fast ( spectator ) processes , such as the sphaleron process , and depend on the temperature .",
    "for example at a high temperature , only the interactions mediated by the gauge and the top yukawa coupling are in the thermal equilibrium , while at a lower temperature weaker interactions come in it .",
    "for instance , let us concentrate on the range of the temperature where the interactions mediated by all the second and third generational yukawa couplings are in the equilibrium but the first generational ones are not .",
    "this range is likely the one in which we are interested , namely @xmath66 . in this range ,",
    "the weak sphaleron and the qcd sphaleron@xcite are considered to occur fast enough .",
    "these fast interactions make the following relations hold among the chemical potentials : @xmath67 in addition to these relations , we impose the charge neutrality of the universe and assume the vanishing asymmetries for the right handed leptons ( and quarks if the qcd sphaleron is not considered ) of the first generation : @xmath68 notice that in the eq.([chemical - charge ] ) , the factor @xmath50 in front of @xmath69 comes from the relative factor in the relation between the asymmetry density and the chemical potential for massless particles : @xmath70 taking care of this factor 2 , we get similar relations among the asymmetries by replacing @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . by solving these relations",
    ", we find the expression of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in terms of @xmath76 as @xmath77 with @xmath78 if we do not consider the qcd sphaleron and with @xmath79 if we take into account it . in the following , we examine only the latter case because there are no qualitative difference .    from these expressions , we have the following boltzmann equation : @xmath80 with @xmath81 where the summation over @xmath82 should be understood . in order to analyse this equation ,",
    "it is convenient to change the variable from @xmath83 to @xmath84 that satisfy @xmath85 so that @xmath86 the range of @xmath84 is from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "the relation between them is shown in the fig.[fig : svsz ] .",
    "as a function of @xmath83 . ]",
    "this figure shows the washout occurs mostly in the temperature range @xmath89 .    for comparison , the boltzmann equation for the usual one - flavor approximation , which is in reality valid only when the temperature is high enough that even the processes mediated by the tau yukawa coupling are out of equilibrium ,",
    "is given as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "roughly speaking , the matrix @xmath93 is close to a diagonal one . and",
    "thus , we can find an approximate solution by a perturbation with respect to rather small off - diagonal elements .",
    "neglecting the off - diagonal elements , each initial asymmetry @xmath94 is exponentially washed out .",
    "the evolution of the asymmetry is given by @xmath95    when the off - diagonal elements are switched on , the asymmetry follows @xmath96 up to the next leading order of the off - diagonal elements . inserting the leading order solution eq.([yi0th ] ) , we find @xmath97 this expression shows that even if the initial asymmetry of a certain flavor is zero , the asymmetry is generated from those of the others although it is suppressed by a small off - diagonal element of @xmath98 . for most cases ,",
    "this order already gives good approximation for the final value of the total asymmetry .      in this case",
    ", one may expect the washout effect is small and thus the flavor effect can not play an important role .",
    "however , even in this case , the final total asymmetry can be 2 times larger than the one - flavor approximation ( see ( 1 ) in fig.[fig : washout ] ) .      in this case",
    ", the summation @xmath104 is dominated by @xmath105 and is larger than @xmath40 .",
    "it is called strong washout region .",
    "as shown below , however , if we take account of the flavor effect the washout effect is drastically changed .",
    "the effect depends strongly on the flavor structure of the initial asymmetry .    in the following ,",
    "let us take @xmath106 as a representative example for clarity .",
    "it is straightforward to apply this analysis to the other cases .",
    "we consider two typical sets of the initial asymmetries :    * @xmath107 + in this case , the washout effect of @xmath108 is controlled by @xmath109 which is much smaller than @xmath110 , while @xmath111 are generated due to the small off - diagonal elements of @xmath112 , with the opposite sign .",
    "because of the large @xmath113 , these generated @xmath111 are washed out strongly and can not become comparable with @xmath108 . thus , in terms of the perturbation , the leading order approximation is sufficient .",
    "+ note that even in this case , the washout factor @xmath114 is quite different ( much larger ) than the one - flavor approximation , @xmath115 ( see ( 2a ) in fig.[fig : washout ] ) .",
    "this is the case even when @xmath109 is not so much smaller than the others , due to the exponential washout factor@xcite . *",
    "@xmath116 and/or @xmath117 + the asymmetry @xmath111 decreases rapidly , while the asymmetry @xmath108 produced due to the off - diagonal elements is washed out much more slowly .",
    "this means that at some point @xmath108 becomes dominant .",
    "once it becomes dominant , the following evolution is similar to the one in the case ( 2a ) .",
    "thus , the washout factor is controlled basically by the small @xmath109 rather than @xmath110 or @xmath113 ( see ( 2b ) in fig.[fig : washout ] ) . interestingly in this case",
    ", the sign of the total @xmath1 asymmetry changes through the washout . + note that the approximation at the nlo is quite bad for @xmath111 because the secondary conversion from @xmath108 , which is generated by the nnlo effect , is important .",
    "nevertheless , the approximation for the total asymmetry is rather good because these are small as in the case ( 2a ) .      in this case , all the asymmetries in each flavors are strongly washed out .",
    "thus , it is hard that the observed value remains after the washout , as far as @xmath120 where the muon yukawa interaction is out of equilibrium , the asymmetry along with the direction in the flavor space that is orthogonal both to the direction determined by @xmath4 yukawa coupling and @xmath121 direction is free from the washout , even in this case@xcite . ] .    from the above considerations , it is clear that the washout factor is basically controlled by the smallest washout mass parameter",
    "this is in great contrast to the non - flavored case , where the factor is controlled basically by the largest washout mass parameter .",
    "interestingly , this is also true even for the case that the initial asymmetry of the flavor with smallest washout mass parameter is tiny . for this case , the effect of the off - diagonal elements , which is usually negligible , is crucial .",

    "in fact , the off diagonal elements transform the asymmetries from those with large @xmath186 to those with small ones .",
    "once transformed , such asymmetries are weakly washed out , and thus a sizable total asymmetry may survive .    for completeness , we examine the possibility that the initial asymmetry is generated by the @xmath5 decay within the thermal leptogenesis scenario .",
    "we show some concrete examples for each class discussed in the above analysis .",
    "finally , let us make a comment on an ambiguity of the boltzmann equations , especially on the factor in front of @xmath47 in eq.([boltzmanneqb - l1 ] ) .",
    "as briefly discussed below the equation , an approximation is used in the derivation of the boltzmann equations ( [ boltzmanneqn ] ) , ( [ boltzmanneqb - l ] ) , and it brings the ambiguity . because the contribution of this term ( @xmath47 ) is relatively small , as seen from ( [ cw / oqcds ] ) and ( [ cwqcds ] ) , this ambiguity does not affect results so much , @xmath187 . in the case",
    "( 2b ) , however , the off diagonal element of @xmath142-matrix , which is of the same order as the @xmath47 contribution , is critical .",
    "in addition , a cancellation occurs between @xmath47 contribution and that of @xmath188 in the off diagonal element .",
    "thus , the result is largely changed due to the ambiguity . in fact , if we take a factor @xmath189 instead of @xmath48 as a possible choice , the final baryon asymmetry is reduced to @xmath190 with the same parameters as ( i@xmath182ib ) in ( [ examples ] ) .",
    "thus , it is important to make a closer look on the boltzmann equations before discussing this novel effect quantitatively .",
