    "there are many different flavors of quantum @xmath0 based on a common algebraic presentations . in particular",
    ", these presentations depend on two features : ( 1 ) if the quantum parameter @xmath1 is generic or a root of unity and ( 2 ) what part of the center is killed .",
    "the associated representation theory varies widely when these features are changed .",
    "two examples , when @xmath1 is a root of unity , are the finite - dimensional hopf algebra commonly known as the small quantum group and the non - restricted quantum group obtained by specializing the de concini - kac form ( for definitions of these algebras see @xcite ) .",
    "the representation theory of the small quantum group leads to a modular category ( in particular a finite , semi - simple , ribbon category ) which can be used to construct 3-manifold invariants . on the other hand",
    ", the representation theory of the non - restricted quantum group contains an infinite class of modules called the cyclic modules .    in this paper",
    "we consider an intermediate quotient @xmath2 , which we call the unrolled quantum group , leading to a category @xmath2-mod which is ribbon but not semi - simple or finite . this category has been used to construct quantum link and 3-manifold invariants in several papers @xcite .",
    "these 3-manifold invariants have powerful new properties , including asymptotic behavior related to the volume conjecture and novel quantum representation of mapping class groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of these properties is directly related to the unique representation theory discussed in this paper .",
    "the hopf algebra @xmath2 of this paper has an additional generator @xmath3 which is not in the usual quantum algebra associated to @xmath0 .",
    "the element @xmath3 should be thought of as a logarithm of the usual generator @xmath4 .",
    "the generator @xmath3 is used to define a braiding and a twist on a category of @xmath2-modules . in this category , @xmath3 is also responsible for the apparition of an infinite cyclic group of one dimensional invertible objects which play a key role in the topological applications .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a survey of the known results about @xmath2-mod while proving some new useful results which have topological applications . in particular",
    ", we classify all indecomposable projective modules and define a modified trace on these objects ( see section [ s : projectives ] ) .",
    "we give a `` graded '' quiver which describes the maps between the indecomposable projective modules ( see section [ s : algproj ] ) .",
    "we also study the decomposition of the tensor product of certain indecomposable modules ( see section [ s : decoftensorpro ] ) .",
    "these results are used in @xcite in an essential way to build a tqft for 3-manifolds equipped with a cohomology class .",
    "the category @xmath2-mod contains some indecomposable non - projective modules that are not studied in this paper ( see for example their use in @xcite ) .",
    "instead here , we focus on semi - simple and projective modules that form together a sub tensor category ( see proposition [ p : s@s ] ) .    the category of @xmath2-modules has a grading in the abelian group @xmath5 and its non semi - simple part is concentrated in degree @xmath6 blocks .",
    "these two blocks form a category similar to the category @xmath7-mod of representations of the standard small quantum group @xmath7 .",
    "the category @xmath7-mod , equivalent to that of modules over the triplet vertex operator algebra @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) , has been intensively studied in logarithmic conformal field theories ( cft ) associated to the @xmath9 triplet algebras ( see @xcite ) . in particular , some results of section [ s : projectives ] are similar to the analysis of projective modules in @xcite .",
    "the category @xmath2-mod has additional modules which do not appear in the representation theory of the small quantum group ( in particular , the one dimensional invertible objects mentioned above ) .",
    "moreover , conjecturally @xmath2-mod is equivalent to the category of representation of the vertex operator algebra called singlet vertex algebra @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "understanding a deeper connection between the representation theory of this paper and cft deserves some attention .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to compare the cft representations of @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) and more generally mapping class group representations ( see @xcite ) with those obtained from @xmath2 in the tqft of @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank simon wood and antun milas for their useful comments on the relations with the theory of logarithmic cfts and the organizers of the conference `` modern trends in topological quantum field theory '' at the erwin schrdinger institut ( vienna ) for their kind invitation to the conference .",
