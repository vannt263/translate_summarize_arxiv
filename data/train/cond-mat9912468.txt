    "optical properties of iii - v semiconductor nanostructures have attracted a great deal of interest , as they are important for applications in optical communications that involve switching , amplification , and signal processings .",
    "ga@xmath1in@xmath0as and ga@xmath1in@xmath0p are among the most important ternary iii - v compound semiconductors .",
    "ga@xmath1in@xmath0as in particular has band gaps covering both the 1.3 and 1.55 @xmath2 range , which are the preferred wavelengths in long distance fiber communications[1 - 3 ] .",
    "however , long - wavelength photonic devices based on lattice - matched ga@xmath3in@xmath4as / inp heterostructures suffer from strong auger recombination and intervalence band absorption processes[4 - 7 ] .",
    "recently , to improve the performance of long - wavelength semiconductor lasers , long wavelength(@xmath5 m ) ga@xmath1in@xmath0as quantum - wire ( qwr ) lasers have been grown by a single step molecular beam epitaxy technique[1 ] .",
    "an important optical property is the change in the emission of light ( in energy , polarization , and intensity ) that results from phase - space filling of carriers in one- and two - dimensionally confined systems , i.e. , as the dimensionality of the quantum confinement increases from one dimension ( 1d ) to 2d , the narrowing of the density of states will exhibit a lower excitation threshold for phase - space filling , thereby , yielding potentially enhanced optical effects .",
    "it is found that the qwr laser structures are a promising candidate for optical communication device because of the many predicted benefits , such as higher gain , reduced temperature sensitivity , higher modulation bandwidths , and narrower spectral linewidths[2 ] .",
    "the fabrication of quantum wires via the strain - induced lateral - layer ordering ( silo ) process starts with the growth of short - period superlattices ( sps ) [ e.g. ( gaas)@xmath6/(inas)@xmath7 along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the excess fractional inas layer leads to stripe - like islands during the mbe growth .",
    "the continued growth of ( gaas)@xmath6/(inas)@xmath8 sps on top of this surface will lead to spatial separation of ga - rich stripes and in - rich stripes due to the effect of strain potential.[1,2 ] thus , a strain - induced lateral ordering occurs and a quantum wire heterostructure can then be created by simply utilizing this sps structure with lateral composition modulation as the quantum well region in a conventional quantum heterostructure . in the experiment performed by chou et al[1 ] and",
    "tang et al[2 ] , the qwr active region is created @xmath9 by the silo process within the ( gaas)@xmath6/(inas)@xmath6 sps regions .",
    "the silo process generates a strong ga / in lateral composition modulation and creates ga - rich @xmath10 lateral qws in the [ 110 ] direction . by sandwiching the composition modulated layer between al@xmath11ga@xmath11in@xmath12as barrier layers ,",
    "a strained qwr heterostructure is formed[1,2 ] . besides the self - assembled lateral ordering",
    ", it is believed that the strain also plays a key role[2 ] in the temperature stability and optical anisotropy for the qwr laser structure .",
    "recent studies indicate that the use of the strained - layer quantum wire heterostructure has advantages of high - quality interfaces and band - gap tuning which are independent of the lattice constant of the constituent materials[3,4 ] .",
    "furthermore , much work has been undertaken which predicts that by using strained - layer superlattice to form the active region of a quantum - wire laser , the threshold current can be decreased by one order of magnitude , and the optical loss due to intervalence - band absorption and auger recombination will also be greatly reduced[1,2,5 - 8 ] . also , the temperature sensitivity is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with strain - free structures[2 ] .",
    "a typical temperature sensitivity of the lasing wavelength is(@xmath13 ) for the usual gainas / inp lasers . by using a distributed - feedback structure ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the lasing wavelength is reduced to @xmath14[2 ] . with this strained gainas qwr ,",
    "the dependence is smaller than @xmath15[2 ] .",
    "it should be an important improvement on the current technology in fabricating the long wavelength lasers for fiber communication . in this paper",
    "we study the effects of multi - axial strain on the electronic and optical properties of the qwr structures grown via the silo process . through this study",
    ", we can gain a better understanding of the strain engineering of qwr structures suitable for the application of fiber - optical communication .    in a previous paper[9 ] , we performed theoretical calculations of the optical properties of silo qwr s within the virtual crystal approximation in which the sps region is modeled by a ga@xmath1in@xmath0as alloy with a lateral modulation of the composition @xmath16 .",
    "although our calculation can explain the qwr band gap and optical anisotropy approximately , it does not take into account the detailed sps structure and the microscopic strain distribution .",
    "the understanding of these effects is important if one wish to have a full design capability of the silo qwr optoelectronic devices .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider two possible local atomic arrangements with sps structure in the silo quantum wires and examine the effects of the microscopic strain distribution on the electronic and optical properties .",
    "the qwr model structures considered in the present paper are depicted in fig .",
    "1 . both model structures start with a quantum well nanostructure in which the supercell consists of 8 stacks of ( 001 ) ( gaas)@xmath6/(inas)@xmath6 sps with a total thickness of @xmath17 ( quantum well region ) followed by a al@xmath11ga@xmath11in@xmath12as layer ( barrier region ) with thickness @xmath18 ( 20 diatomic layers ) . in the first qwr model structure ( a ) , the strain - induced lateral ordering is modeled by interchanging a segment of 29 ga atoms in the right half of the first row in the sps ( each row in the sps consists of 72 atoms along the [ 110 ] direction such that the period is around 300  ) with a segment of 29 in atoms in the left half of the third row .",
    "[ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] this structure is an idealized model of a silo qwr which starts with a growth of ( gaas)@xmath6/(inas)@xmath19 sps . it is assumed that during growth an extra 0.4 monolayer of in atoms on the surface form stripe - like islands aligned along the [ @xmath20 direction [ corresponding to the segment of 29 in atoms in the first row of fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , which serves as a seed structure for the formation of the silo qwr .",
    "the deposition of two more gaas monolayers leaves extra 0.4 monolayer of ga atoms on the surface , which again form stripe - like islands [ corresponding to the segment of 29 ga atoms in the third row of fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . due to the strain potential",
    ", the ga stripes are spatially separated from the in stripes buried two monolayers beneath .",
    "thus , the continued growth of ( gaas)@xmath6/(inas)@xmath6 sps on top of the seed structure will lead to a silo qwr structure shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) .    in the second qwr model structure ( b )",

    ", we can divide the silo qwr into two regions with the left half being ga rich and the right half in rich .",
    "the average ga ( in ) mole fraction in the ga ( in)-rich region is 0.7 ( 0.3 ) . alternatively , we can divide the first structure into three regions which include ( inas)@xmath27(gaas)@xmath28 , ( inas)@xmath6(gaas)@xmath6 , and ( inas)@xmath28(gaas)@xmath27 sps s with the in mole fraction changes abruptly between boundaries of the three regions . in the second structure ,",
    "the in mole fraction for the whole qwr varies continuously between 0.3 and 0.7 for @xmath21 changing from the ga - rich region to the in - rich region .    a valence force field ( vff )",
    "model[10 - 12 ] is used to find the equilibrium atomic positions in the silo qwr structure by minimizing the lattice energy .",
    "the strain tensor at each atomic ( in or ga ) site is then obtained by calculating the local distortion of chemical bonds .",
    "we found that different local arrangement of atoms can lead to very different strain distribution . in particular ,",
    "the shear strain can change substantially from structure 1 ( with abrupt change in in composition ) to structure 2 ( with gradual change in in composition ) .",
    "furthermore , we found that the optical anisotropy can be reversed due to the change in the strength of the shear strain caused by the intermixing of in and ga atoms .",
    "we found that both structures give band gaps close to experimental value .",
    "however , only the second structure gives good agreement with the published experimental data[1,2 ] on both band gap and optical anisotropy , indicating that random mixing of in and ga atoms on the growth surface when the island structure is present best matches the experimental situation .",
    "the method used in this paper for calculating the strained qwr band structure is based on the effective bond - orbital model ( ebom ) .",
    "a detailed description of this method has been published elsewhere[13,14 ] .",
    "ebom is a tight binding - like model with minimum set of localized basis ( the bonding or anti - bonding orbitals ) .",
    "the interaction and optical parameters are obtained by a correspondence with the @xmath29 theory , which can be cast into analytic forms .",
    "thus , the model can be viewed as a spatially discretized version of the @xmath29 method , while retaining the virtues of lcao ( linear combination of atomic orbitals ) method .",
    "the @xmath29 model is the most popular one for treating electronic structures of semiconductor quantum wells or superlattices .",
    "however , when applied to complex structures such as silo quantum wires[1 - 4 ] or self - assembled quantum dots[10,15 ] , the method becomes very cumbersome if one wish to implement the correct boundary conditions that take into account the differences in @xmath29 band parameters for different materials involved .",
    "ebom is free of this problem , since different material parameters are used at different atomic sites in a natural way . for simple structures , when both ebom and @xmath29 model are equally applicable ,",
    "the results obtained are essentially identical.[13 ]    the optical matrix elements for the qwr states are computed in terms of elementary optical matrix elements between the valence - band bond orbitals and the conduction - band orbitals .",
    "the present calculation includes the coupling of the four spin-3/2 valence bands and the two spin-1/2 conduction bands closest to the band edges .",
    "thus , it is equivalent to a 6-band @xmath29 model . for our systems studied here ,",
    "the band - edge properties are relatively unaffected by the split - off band due to the large spin - orbit splitting as discussed in our previous paper[9 ] .",
    "hence , the split - off bands are ignored here .",
    "the bond - orbitals for the gaas and inas needed in the expansion of the superlattice states contain the following : four valence - band bond orbitals per bulk unit cell , which are p - like orbitals coupled with the spin to form orbitals with total angular momentum j=3/2 plus two conduction - band bond orbitals with j=1/2 .",
    "they are written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and 3/2 for the conduction and valence bands , respectively , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , designates the electron spinor(@xmath34=1/2,-1/2 ) , and @xmath35 denote an @xmath36-like(@xmath37 ) bond orbital , located at unit cell @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 are the coupling coefficients obtainable by group theory .",
    "all these bond orbitals are assumed to be sufficiently localized so that the interaction between orbitals separated farther than the nearest - neighbor distance can be ignored .    the effect of strain is included by adding a strain hamiltonian @xmath40 to the ebom hamiltonian[14 ] .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath40 in the bond - orbital basis can be obtained by the deformation - potential theory of bir and pikus[16 ] .",
    "we use the valence - force field ( vff ) model of keating and martin[11,12 ] to calculate the microscopic strain distribution .",
    "this model has been shown to be successful in fitting and predicting the elastic constants of elastic continuum theory , calculating strain distribution in a quantum well , and determining the atomic structure of iii - v alloys .",
    "it was also used in the calculation of the strain distribution in self - assembled quantum dots.[10 ] the vff model is a microscopic theory which includes bond stretching and bond bending , and avoids the potential failure of elastic continuum theory in the atomically thin limit .",

    "minimization of the total energy requires one to solve a set of coupled equations with 3n variables , where n is the total number of atoms .",
    "direct solution of these equations is impractical in our case , since the system contains more than 6,000 atoms .",
    "we use an approach taken by several authors which has been shown to be quite efficient . in the beginning of the simulation",
    "all the atoms are placed on the inp lattice , we allow atoms to deviate from this starting positions and use periodic boundary conditions in the plane perpendicular to the growth direction , while keeping atoms in the planes outside the sps region at their ideal atomic positions for a inp lattice ( since the silo qwr is grown epitaxially on the inp substrate ) . in each iteration , only one atomic position is displaced and other atom positions are held fixed .",
    "the direction of the displacement of atom @xmath50 is determined according to the force @xmath51 acting on it .",
    "all atoms are displaced in sequence .",
    "the whole sequence is repeated until the forces acting on all atoms become zero at which point the system energy is a minimum . once the positions of all the atoms are known , the strain distribution is obtained through the strain tensor calculated according to the method described in ref .

    "shear strains are shown in the original cartesian coordinates .    since the atomic species does not change along @xmath75 , the @xmath75 coordinate of all atoms",
    "are very close to the original values pinned by the substrate ( inp ) , thus @xmath78 ( solid lines ) are essentially constants along @xmath21 in regions where atomic species are same . for example , layer 2 contains all in atoms , and @xmath78 is constant with a value equal to @xmath79 . in layer 1 ,",
    "ga atoms occupy the sites labeled y=40 - 68 , and the rest are in atoms .",

    "( without lateral relaxation ) , @xmath82 should be the same as @xmath78 due to symmetry .",
    "however , with the lateral modulation as considered here , all ga(in ) atoms tend to shift in a direction so as to reduce the strain in the ga(in)-rich region , while they shift in the opposite direction in the in(ga)-rich region .",
    "thus , the magnitude of @xmath82 on ga(in ) sites ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) is lower than @xmath78 in ga(in)-rich region and vice versa in in(ga)-rich region . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath83 component strain ( dash - dotted lines ) tend to compensate the other two components such that the volume of each bulk unit cell is close to that for the unstrained bulk .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath84 has an opposite sign compared to @xmath78 or @xmath82 at all atomic sites .",
    "the difference in @xmath78 and @xmath82 leads to a nonzero shear strain @xmath85 in the original coordinates .",

    "6 ( dashed lines ) . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding band edges for a sps structure without the al@xmath11ga@xmath11in@xmath12as confining barrier are also shown with ( dash - dotted ) and without ( solid ) the effect of strain .",
    "the strain hamiltonian used here is the same as the one used in the silo qwr at the corresponding @xmath21 .",
    "all material parameters are chosen the same as in ref . [ 9 ] for temperature at 77k , except that the deformation potentials used here are slightly different .",
    "we use @xmath95 , @xmath96 for gaas and inas , respectively .",
    "these values are within the uncertainties of experimentally determined values[20,21 ] and they give a better agreement for the band gaps of ( gaas)@xmath6(inas)@xmath6 sps and silo qwrs between the calculated and experimental values .",
    "the photoluminecence ( pl ) measurements indicates that the ( gaas)@xmath6(inas)@xmath6 sps grown on inp substrate has a gap around 0.76 ev.[22 ] her we obtain a band gap of 0.76 ev for the ( gaas)@xmath6(inas)@xmath6 sps ( at @xmath21=36 ) and 0.78 ev for 8 stacks ( or 100  ) of ( gaas)@xmath6(inas)@xmath6 sps sandwiched between al@xmath11ga@xmath11in@xmath12as confining barriers .",
    "this is also consistent with the pl measurements on the ( gaas)@xmath6(inas)@xmath6/inp multiple quantum wells.[22 ] as seen in this figure , the strain effect causes a shift of conduction band edge by @xmath97 ev ( 0.4 ev ) and valence - band edge by @xmath98 ev ( 0.3 ev ) in structure 1 ( structure 2 ) .",
    "the band - edge profiles shown in this figure suggest that both electrons and holes are confined in the ga - rich region with a band offset around 0.15 ev for the electron and 0.05 ev for the hole .",
    "both offsets are large enough to give rise to strong lateral confinement for electrons and holes in the ga - rich region .",
    "7 shows the near zone - center valence subband structures of the qwr model structure 1 as depicted in fig .",
    "all subbands are two - fold degenerate at the zone center due to the kramer s degeneracy and they split at finite wave vectors as a result of lack of inversion symmetry in the system . comparing the band structures in both @xmath99 ( @xmath100 $ ] ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath101 $ ] ) directions , we noticed an apparent anisotropy in the energy dispersion .",
    "the dispersions in the @xmath72 direction for the ( confined ) valence bands are rather small , indicating strong lateral confinement .",
    "the first three pairs of subbands are labeled v1 , v2 , and v3 .",
    "they have unusually large energy separations compared with other valence subbands .",
    "this is because the first three pairs of subbands represent qwr confined states , whereas the other valence subbands ( with energies below -110 mev ) are unconfined by the lateral composition modulation . to examine the effects caused by the shear strain",
    ", we have also calculated the band structures with the shear strain set to zero .",
    "we found that without the shear strain the first pairs of valence subbands ( v1 ) have much larger dispersion along the @xmath99 direction with an effective masses along @xmath100 $ ] about a factor five smaller than the effective mass for the v1 subbands with the shear strain .",
    "this indicates that the v1 subband states for the case without shear strain are derived mainly from bond orbitals with @xmath75-character , which leads to stronger overlap between two bond orbitals along the @xmath75 direction , hence larger dispersion along @xmath99 .",
    "when the shear strain is present , the character of bond orbitals in the v1 subband states change from mainly @xmath75-like to predominantly @xmath21-like ; thus , the dispersion along @xmath99 becomes much weaker .",
    "this explains the very flat v1 subbands as shown in fig .",
    "physically , the switching of orbital character in the v1 subbands can be understood as follows .",
    "when the shear strain is absent , we have @xmath102 , and the confinement effect in the @xmath21 direction pushes down the subband with @xmath21 character ( which has smaller effective mass in the @xmath21 direction ) , thus leaving the top valence subband ( v1 ) to have [ predominantly @xmath75 character . on the other hand , with the presence of shear strain",
    "as shown in stricture 1 , we have @xmath103 in ga - rich region , and the strain potential forces the @xmath21-like subband to move above the @xmath75-like subband , overcoming the confinement effect . as a result ,",
    "the v1 subbands become @xmath21-like .",
    "the conduction subbands are approximately parabolic as usual with a zone - center subband minimum equal to 716 mev this gives an energy gap of 791 mev for qwr model structure 1 .",

    "here we consider only the @xmath75 ( along the qwr axis ) and @xmath21 ( perpendicular to the qwr axis ) components .",
    "as seen in this figure , the c1-v1 transition for @xmath21-polarization ( dashed line ) is about two times that for the @xmath75-polarization ( solid line ) , indicating an optical anisotropy ( @xmath110}-p^2_{[110]})/(p^2_{[1\\bar 1 0]}+p^2_{[110]})$ ] ) around 0.4 .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion for valence subband structures shown in fig . 7 , where we concluded that the bond orbitals involved in the v1 subbands are predominantly @xmath21-like .",
    "the optical anisotropy for qwr model structure 1 is reversed compared with the optical anisotropy observed in the photoluminescence measurements for most ingaas silo qwrs .",
    "as pointed out in our previous paper , the lateral confinement in a typical qwr ( without shear strain ) leads to a positive optical anisotropy[9 ] .",
    "here we found the opposite result .",
    "this apparent `` anomaly '' is caused by the presence of the strong shear strain ( especially the @xmath90 component ) in the qwr model structure .",
    "if we artificially turn off the shear strain , then the normal ( positive ) optical anisotropy can be resumed .",
    "we have studied several other model structures .",
    "we found that as long as we maintain an ordered structure along the @xmath75 ( with the same periodicity as bulk ) , the lateral modulation in the @xmath21 direction is necessarily a sharp transition in in composition , and the structure always has a large shear strain near the boundary where the in composition changes .",
    "the fact that most silo qwrs display a positive optical anisotropy indicating that these structures can not be modeled by a ordered sps structure as depicted in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there do exist a few silo qwr samples that display a slightly negative optical anisotropy at 77k[23 ] .",
    "perhaps , these silo qwr structures have more abrupt change in in composition along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "knowing that a positive optical anisotropy can occur in a qwr structure with weak shear strain , we now turn to our model structure 2 , in which a gradual lateral modulation in in composition substantially reduces the shear strain ( see fig .",
    "the calculated valence subband structures for this qwr model structure are shown in fig .",
    "9 . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "7 , we find striking differences in band structures for the two qwr model structures .",
    "the first pairs of subbands ( labeled v1 ) in fig .",
    "9 has much larger dispersion than their counterparts in fig . 7 , and there exists an anti - cross behavior between the first pair of subbands ( labeled v1 ) and the lower subbands ( similar to the lh1-hh2 anti - crossing pattern typically appeared in iii - v quantum wells[24,25 ] ) near @xmath111 in fig .",
    "this anti - crossing pattern is missing in fig . 7 for qwr model structure 1 .",
    "again , the presence of the strong shear strain in the qwr structure is responsible for this difference . by turning off the shear strain artificially in qwr model structure 1",
    ", we found that the dispersion of the v1 subbands become similar to that shown in fig .",
    "9 with an anti - crossing pattern .",
    "the conduction band minimum ( not shown ) is 676 mev for qwr model structure 2 .",
    "this gives rise to a band gap of 767 mev , which is very good agreement with the experimental results for ingaas silo qwr with similar specification .",
    "10 shows the squared optical matrix elements ( @xmath104 ) versus wave vectors of qwr model structure 2 for transitions involving the first three pairs of valence subbands ( v1 , v2 , v3 ) and the first pair of conduction subbands ( c1 ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are for the polarization vector along the @xmath99 ( @xmath112 $ ] ) ( parallel to the wire ) and @xmath72 ( [ 110 ] ) ( perpendicular to the wire ) directions .",
    "we found for the parallel polarization ( solid lines ) , the squared optical matrix element for the v1-c1 transition has a maximum at the zone center with a value near 20 ev and remains close to this value for all finite @xmath72 and for @xmath113 .",
    "for @xmath99 from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , it drops very quickly as a result of band mixing with lower valence subbands .",
    "for the perpendicular polarization , the optical strength for the v1-c1 transition is nearly zero for finite @xmath72 and @xmath116 .",
    "it gradually increases as @xmath99 increases and become appreciable for @xmath117 .",
    "this means that the bond orbitals involved in the v1 subband states are mostly @xmath75-like .",
    "this is consistent with the consequence of the lateral confinement on a hh1-like quantum well state ( see discussions in ref .",
    "9 ) . comparing fig . 10 with fig",
    ". 8 , we see that for the v1-c1 transition not only the optical anisotropy is reversed , but their @xmath99 dependence is also qualitatively different . in fig .",
    "8 , the optical strength for the c1-v1 transition decays very slowly as @xmath99 increases , showing no sign of band - mixing effect , consistent with the absence of anti - crossing pattern in fig .",
    "7 .    to calculate the optical anisotropy in the photoluminescence spectra",
    ", we integrate the squared optical matrix element over the range of @xmath99 corresponding to the spread of exciton envelope function in the @xmath99 space .",
    "the exciton envelope function is obtained by solving the 1d schrding equation for the exciton in the effective - mass approximation similar to what we did in ref .",
    "the exciton binding energy obtained is 23 mev .",
    "we found that the ratio of the averaged optical strength for the v1-c1 transition for the parallel to perpendicular component of the polarization vector is 0.5 and 3.82 for the model structures 1 and 2 considered here .",
    "our results for qwr model structure 2 are qualitatively similar to that reported in ref . 9 for a qwr structure made of 3d alloy structures with composition modulation . here",
    "we have a 2d alloy structure with composition modulation and a sps structure in the third direction .",
    "furthermore , we have included the effects of microscopic strain distribution at the atomistic level .",
    "the agreement with the experimental observation for the band gap ( 735 mev ) and ratio of parallel to perpendicular optical strength ( around 2 - 4 for a number of qwr structures)[1,2 ] is also much better than that obtained in the 3d alloy structure model .",
    "thus , we conclude that our model structure 2 has captured all the essential features of the realistic experimental silo qwr structure .",
    "we have calculated the band structures and optical matrix elements for the strained gainas qwr grown by the silo method . the actual sps structure and",
    "the microscopic strain distribution has been taken into account .",
    "the effects of microscopic strain distribution on the valence subband structures and optical matrix elements are discussed for two model silo qwr structures , one with ideal periodicity along the wire axis and abrupt changes of in composition in the lateral direction , while the other with a 2d alloy mixing and gradual lateral modulation of the in composition in the interface layers of the sps structure . the valence force field",
    "( vff ) model is used to calculate the equilibrium atomic positions in the model qwr structures .",
    "this allows the calculation of the strain distribution at the atomistic level .",
    "we found that in model structure 1 or any similar structures with ideal periodicity along the wire axis , the strain distribution always has large off - diagonal ( shear strain ) components , which can alter the valence subband structures substantially and give rise to a reversed optical anisotropy compared with qwr structures with negligible shear strain ( such as the model structure 2 ) .",
    "this points to a possibility of `` shear strain - engineering '' to obtain qwr laser structures of desired optical anisotropy .",
    "the band gap and optical anisotropy obtained for model structure 2 are in very good agreement with experimental observations on most ingaas silo qwrs with similar specifications .",
    "this indicates that our model structure 2 is fairly close to the realistic structure at least in the essential physical aspects .",
    "the optical anisotropy obtained in our model structure 1 is revered compared with that in model structure 2 and in the photoluminescence measurements for most inas / gaas silo qwrs .",
    "however , there exist a few inas / gaas silo qwr samples which display the reversed optical anisotropy at 77 k.[23 ] furthermore , strained inas / gaas qwrs with ideal periodicity along the [ @xmath118 axis may be grown via e - beam lithography followed by _ in situ _ regrowth",
    ". it will be interesting to see if these ideal qwr structures grown in the future will display the reversed optical anisotropy as we predicted here .",
