    "since 1998 reliable cosmological data have been accumulated leading to the conclusion that our universe has entered recently into an accelerated expansion epoch .",
    "the luminosity - distance data of supernovae ia ( sne ia ) has provided the main evidence .",
    "hitherto explanations to this phenomenon are not satisfactory .",
    "most models consider accelerated expansion as due to a component of the universe that behaves opposite to gravity , the so called _ dark energy _ ( de ) .",
    "another unknown component of the universe is the _ dark matter _ ( dm ) , the missing mass necessary to held together galaxy clusters , also needed to explain the current large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the preferred model to describe accelerated expansion is the lambda - cold - dark - matter ( @xmath7cdm ) .",
    "however , cosmological constant has several theoretical drawbacks , like the discrepancies between the observed and theoretical values , i.e. the fine tuning problem ; the coincidence problem is another objection , meaning the fact that dark energy is nearly equal to the matter density just now . among many proposals to give a satisfactory answer",
    "there are some models that consider de as a dynamical component , such as quintessence or k - essence ; in others proposals de appears as the result of the interaction of fundamental particles . in here",
    "we adhere to the stream that considers dm and de as different manifestations of the same component , describing the dark sector as some kind of matter whose physical properties depend on the scale : behaving as dm at high densities and transforming into de at lower densities .",
    "these unified dark matter models have the generalized chaplygin gas as its paradigmatic example @xcite , however these models present undesirable features like oscillations in the matter power spectrum and to mend this inconvenience it should be assumed the existence of nonadiabatic pressure perturbations .    on the other side , in the context of inflation of the very early universe , it has been known since long time ago that an imperfect fluid with bulk viscosity can produce an acceleration in the expansion without falling back on a cosmological constant or some inflationary scalar field @xcite . inspired in those inflationary models",
    "there are some recent @xcite and not so recent @xcite developments that assume a universe filled with a viscous single fluid .",
    "the bulk viscosity contributes to the cosmic pressure and drives the accelerated expansion .",
    "the origin of the bulk viscosity in a physical system is due to its deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite and different cooling rates @xcite . in a cosmological fluid ,",
    "the bulk viscosity arises when the fluid expands ( or contracts ) too fast so that the system does not have enough time to restore the local thermodynamic equilibrium and then it appears an effective pressure restoring the system to its local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "bulk viscosity can be seen as a measurement of this effective pressure .",
    "when the fluid reaches again the thermal equilibrium then the bulk viscosity pressure ceases @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , in an accelerated expanding universe it may be natural to suppose that the expansion process is actually a collection of states out of thermal equilibrium in a small fraction of time that being modeled by a bulk viscous fluid might be a more realistic description of the accelerated universe today .",
    "moreover , these models have in their favour that behave well when density perturbations come into play : the power spectrum for viscous matter is well behaved and consistent with large scale structure data @xcite .",
    "in particular , it does not suffer from the oscillation problem of chaplygin models @xcite .    on the other hand , since the earliest evidence of tight correlations in gamma - ray bursts spectral properties @xcite , the possibility arose of using grbs as standard candles .",
    "being so grbs may open a window in redshift as far as @xmath8 @xcite , extending then the attainable range provided by sne ia observations . for an overview of most recent missions , see @xcite and references therein . at these epochs , @xmath8 ,",
    "the universe was dominated by dark matter , from which follows that this tool is less sensitive to dark energy .",
    "however for models where dark energy and matter are coupled @xcite or unified @xcite grbs might be a useful tool .",
    "grbs were prevented of being used as standard candles because the intrinsic faintness of the nearby events , a fact that introduced a bias towards low redshifts of grb and therefore the extrapolation of their correlations to low - z events faced serious problems .",
    "however this problem is solved if one uses sne ia data , in a combined calibration with grbs at low redshifts , allowing then grbs be considered as distance indicators @xcite . in particular , liang @xcite implemented a method to circumvent this objection , obtaining the distance modulus of grb at low redshift by interpolating from the hubble diagram of sne ia .",
    "then grb relations are calibrated without assumming a particular cosmological model ; fair is to say that there is some criticism to the method @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we test the model ( presented in @xcite ) that considers a bulk viscous fluid as source of matter , with grbs data given in @xcite containing redshifts up to @xmath9 . in this way",
    "we extend the previous sne ia probes of the model . in sec .",
    "ii we introduced the main aspects of the bulk viscosity model ; in sec .",
    "iii the calibration of grbs is addressed . in sec .",
    "iv we apply the calibrated relation to higher redshifts and do the statistics to find the best fit for the bulk viscosity parameter .",
    "we carry on the analysis with the observational data including sne ia ; bao for clusters with redshifts up approximately 2 , as well as cmb5-year and cmb7-year data from wmap ; this last probe tests the model up to the last scattering surface , about @xmath10 ; according to our analysis the model is not reliable to such far epoch , but we extend its applicability to epochs of formation of structure @xmath8 .",
    "we discuss conclusions and perspectives in the last section .",
    "in @xcite , the baryon and dark matter components are modeled by a pressureless fluid characterized by a constant bulk viscosity @xmath4 .",
    "lying the bulk viscosity constant in the range @xmath5 , the model possesses many desirable properties , namely : holding the second law of thermodynamics , the derived age of the universe is in perfect agreement with the constraint of globular clusters , it has a big - bang followed by a decelerated expansion with a smooth transition to an accelerated expansion epoch in late times .",
    "previous cosmological probes done by avelino and nucamendi include the sne ia gold 2006 sample ( 182 sne ia ) and bao in a quick fit @xcite .",
    "the many good properties of the model justifies to complete with grbs the observational confrontation . in this paper",
    "the model is tested for the first time using grbs , and updated tests using cmb five and seven years wmap data , as well as sne ia union2 sample and bao .",
    "the results point out the strengths and what maybe be the limit of applicability of the model , as are the far far epochs of the universe , at very high redshifts of the recombination epoch .    before going on",
    ", we note that nucamendi - avelino @xcite addressed the possibility of extending the model of constant bulk viscosity to a model where the viscosity depends on @xmath11 as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants and @xmath11 is the hubble parameter . using the scp union2 sne ia data set composed of 557 type ia sne @xcite , they found that from all possible scenarios predicted by the model according to different values of the dimensionless bulk viscous coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 the preferred ones are two ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) with @xmath19 , and ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . nevertheless , one of the disadvantages of the model parameterized by @xmath22 , is that the best estimated total bulk viscosity function @xmath23 is positive for redshifts @xmath24 and negative for @xmath25 latter implies a violation to the local second law of thermodynamics ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "then , the simplest model of one parameter @xmath26 turned out to be the best candidate to explain the present accelerated expansion .",
    "for an imperfect fluid , the energy - momentum tensor with a first - order deviation from the thermodynamic equilibrium is : @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the four - velocity vector of an observer who measures the effective pressure @xmath30 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the pressure and density of the fluid respectively .",

    "many other similar models exist in the literature , based in similar ideas @xcite ; the conclusions we obtained then should be pertinent for models alike .",
    "the main observables that can be measured when studying grbs are its spherical equivalent energy , its peak isotropic luminosity , the peak energy of its spectrum , the photon fluence , the energy fluence , the pulse duration and the redshift of its host galaxy . several empirical correlations among these variables can be established , see for example @xcite .    the origin , reliability and dispersion of spectral energy correlations of grbs",

    "butler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a very critical analysis on the observational selection effects , as the origin of the grbs energy correlations .",
    "they concluded that rigorously , neither @xmath63 nor @xmath66 satisfy what should a physically - based correlation fulfil : to show a reduced scatter in the rest frame relative to the observer frame , and that must not persist if the assumed redshifts are scattered .",
    "moreover , the discovery of some outliers to these relations has raised the suspicion that these correlations belong only to a sub - population of long grbs or that they are an artifact of the grbs detection process . in @xcite",
    "it is pointed out that grbs correlations are strongly influenced by the number - biased against hard photons of the grbs detectors .",
    "as far as the ghirlanda correlation @xmath66 , that in some analysis it turns out favored respect to the amati s , as the tighest of the grbs calibrations , it has the inconvenience that to be included in this relation , the grb afterglow must have an observed jet break in its light curve , thus , only a fraction of the observed events can contribute to establishing this relation .",
    "amati @xcite contributes to robust the @xmath63 relation by testing two extremely energetic grbs ( grb080916c and grb090323 ) measured by _",
    "fermi _ , showing that both events are fully consistent with @xmath63 correlation .",
    "recently , in @xcite it is performed a rigorous analysis of the multivariate data , considering also selection effects of grbs , then the authors came to the conclusion that there exists a real , intrinsic correlation between @xmath63 , but not a narrow log - log and it is strongly detector dependent .",
    "having in mind the previous warnings , we consider the @xmath63 relation along with data presented in @xcite and performing the pertinent calibration , we proceed to constrain the bulk viscosity model .",
    "most calibrations take for granted a particular cosmological model , to remedy this circularity problem , liang @xcite proposed a cosmology - independent calibration method , consisting in calibrating at low redshifts using the sne ia data , mending so the few available low redshift grbs data ; the basic idea supporting the method is that light travels in the expanding universe in the same way no matter what its source be .",
    "the typical spectrum of the prompt emission of grbs can be expressed as exponentially connected broken power - law , the so called band function @xcite",
    ". then we can determine spectral peak energy @xmath68 , corresponding to the photon energy at maximum in @xmath69 spectra .",
    "we shall apply the empirical relation @xmath70 that connects @xmath71 with the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath65 derived by amati @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the bolometric fluence of gamma rays in the grb at redshift @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the luminosity distance of the grb ( of the hosting galaxy ) .    using at low redshifts the 557 union2 sne ia data @xcite , wei ( 2010 ) derived the distance moduli for the 50 low - redshift ( @xmath76 ) grbs by using a cubic interpolation from the 557 union2 sne ia .",

    "our calibration improves the one presented by capozziello and izzo @xcite , given by @xmath82 performed with the sne ia union sample of 307 objects .",
    "moreover , being with errors of better than one part in @xmath83 , our calibration is also better than the amati correlation presented by liang @xcite , done using the 192 sne ia sample .",
    "remind that at low redshifts the calibration is obtained using sne ia samples , and then extrapolated to the grbs with higher redshifts .",
    "therefore the slight differences in calibrations are mainly the result of the different sne ia samples used at the low redshift calibration .    extrapolating the calibrated amati relation to 59 high - redshift grbs ( @xmath84 ) given in table 2 by wei @xcite , with the corresponding @xmath68 and deriving @xmath65 from the calibrated amati relation , eq .",

    "the model is in good agreement with observational data from sn ia , bao and grbs , up to the range of @xmath9 with a chi - square statistics of @xmath147 .    probing with sne ia and grbs we obtained as the present hubble parameter @xmath148 , the deceleration parameter @xmath149 , both in good agreement with the accepted values ;",
    "as the redshift transition parameter we obtain @xmath150 .",
    "when the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data are included in the data - model confrontation , we obtain a viscosity parameter @xmath151 , included in the correct range , and improved values for @xmath152 and @xmath147 .",
    "the results with bao confirm the analysis performed by hiplito - ricaldi ( 2009 ) @xcite on the matter power spectrum showing the compatibility of the bulk viscosity models with the 2dfgrs and sdss data .",
    "however the model does not pass the cmb test , exhibiting @xmath153 for cmb5 and @xmath154 for cmb7 , besides a negative bulk viscosity constant , violating so the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "these results are consequence of neglecting a radiative component in the universe , that in so far epochs as the recombination , plays an important role .",
    "thus , when testing so far epochs a radiation component should be added to the universe content , a component that is conserved independently of the rest of matter considered .    to conclude , constant bulk viscosity matter reproduce observational sn ia , grbs and bao data in good agreement ( @xmath147 ) , being then a reliable model not only for the recent state of the universe , but for epochs where structure already existed ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is an open questions if the model could account for the cmb data if a radiation component is included in the considered matter content of the universe .",
