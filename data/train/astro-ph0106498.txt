    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies in order to achieve an order of magnitude improvement on previous redshift surveys , and provide a detailed and representative picture of the galaxy population and its large - scale structure in the nearby universe .",
    "the main goals of the 2dfgrs are :    1 .  to measure the galaxy power spectrum @xmath6 on scales up to a few hundred mpc , filling the gap between the small scales where @xmath6 is known from previous galaxy redshift surveys and the largest scales where @xmath6 is well - determined by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "particular goals are to determine the scale of the turnover in the power spectrum and to observe in the galaxy distribution the acoustic peaks detected in the cmb power spectrum ( percival  2001 ) .    2 .  to measure the redshift - space distortion of the large - scale clustering that results from the peculiar velocity field produced by the mass distribution ( peacock  2001 )",
    "this distortion depends on both the mass density parameter @xmath7 and the bias factor @xmath8 of the galaxy distribution with respect to the mass distribution , constraining the combination @xmath9 .",
    "3 .  to measure higher - order clustering statistics of the galaxy distribution in order to : ( a )  determine the bias parameter @xmath8",
    ", revealing the relationship between the distributions of mass and light and yielding a direct measure of @xmath7 ; ( b )  establish whether the galaxy distribution on large scales is a gaussian random field , as predicted by most inflationary models of the early universe ; and ( c )  investigate the non - linear growth of clustering in the small - scale galaxy distribution .",
    "4 .  to fully and precisely characterise the galaxy population in terms of the distributions of fundamental properties such as luminosity , surface brightness , spectral type and star - formation rate ( folkes  1999",
    "; cole  2001 ; madgwick  2001a ; cross  2001 ) .",
    "5 .  to quantify the relationships between the internal properties of galaxies ( such as luminosity , spectral type and star - formation rate ) and their external environment ( the local density of galaxies and the surrounding large - scale structure ) in order to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution ( norberg  2001a ) .",
    "6 .  to investigate the properties of galaxy groups and clusters , not just from existing cluster catalogues ( de propris  2001 ) , but by defining a large , homogeneous sample of groups and clusters in redshift space , avoiding the problems of cluster catalogues defined in projection and allowing detailed study of the mass distributions and dynamical evolution in the most massive bound structures in the universe .    7 .  to provide a massive spectroscopic database for use in conjunction with other surveys , for finding rare and interesting types of object , and as a source for a wide variety of follow - up observations ( cole  2001 ;",
    "sadler  2001 , magliocchetti  2001 ) .",
    "this paper provides an overview of the survey and detailed description of the survey observations .",
    "the layout of the papers is as follows :  2 summarises the main capabilities of the 2df multi - fibre spectrograph ; ",
    "3 describes the input source catalogue for the survey ;  4 discusses the survey design , including the areas of sky covered by the survey and the tiling of the survey fields ;  5 outlines the algorithm used to assign fibres to targets , and its uniformity and completeness ;  6 describes the spectroscopic data obtained for the survey and the data reduction methods ;  7 deals with the estimation of the redshifts and various internal and external checks on their reliability and precision ;  8 describes the survey masks , which encapsulate the coverage , magnitude limits and redshift completeness of the survey ;  9 outlines the main components and features of the survey database ;  10 summarises some of the main results emerging from the survey ; and  11 provides conclusions .",
    "the survey is designed around the two - degree field ( 2df ) multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope , which is capable of observing up to 400 objects simultaneously over a 2  diameter field of view .",
    "here we summarise the aspects of the instrument relevant to the 2dfgrs ; a full description is provided by lewis  ( 2001 ) and the 2df user manual ( http://www.aao.gov.au/2df ) .",
    "the four main components of 2df are the corrector optics , the fibre positioner , the fibres and the spectrographs .",
    "the 2df corrector optics are a four - element lens assembly which gives 1  images over a 2.1  diameter flat field of view at the prime focus of the aat .",
    "the corrector incorporates an atmospheric dispersion compensator ( adc ) which corrects for atmospheric dispersion at zenith distances less than about 70 .",
    "the most significant remaining image degradation is a chromatic variation in distortion , which has the effect of dispersing images in the radial direction .",
    "this effect is largest halfway out from the field centre , where the wavelength range 0.351.0@xmath10 m is dispersed over 2  radially .",
    "the radial distortion introduced by the corrector gives an image scale that varies over the field of view , from 15.5/mm at the centre to 14.2/mm at the edge ; the corresponding change in focal ratio is from f/3.4 to f/3.7 .",
    "the 2df fibre positioner x - y robot takes about 67  seconds on average to position one fibre . since",
    "approximately 550580 fibre moves are required to re - configure a typical 400-fibre field , this means that a full re - configuration takes about 6065  minutes .",
    "the actual configuration time varies depending on the number of fibres used and the complexity of the field . to avoid dead - time there are two field plates , each with 400 fibres .",
    "while one field plate is placed at the focal plane for observing , the other is being re - configured by the fibre positioner .",
    "the positions of the field plates are reversed by tumbling them about their horizontal axis .",
    "the fibres are have 140@xmath10 m diameter cores , corresponding to 2.16  at the field centre and 1.99  at the field edge .",
    "there are 400 fibres on each field plate .",
    "the internal precision with which the fibres are positioned is 11@xmath10 m ( 0.16 ) on average , with no fibres outside 20@xmath10 m ( 0.3 ) .",
    "the fibres terminate in magnetic ` buttons ' that attach to the steel field plates .",
    "each button has a right - angle prism which directs the light from the focal plane into the fibre . to prevent fibre buttons coming into direct contact and protect the fragile prisms ,",
    "the fibres can not be placed too close together .",
    "the absolute minimum fibre separation is 800@xmath10 m ( approximately 12 ) , and the required separation is generally larger ( approximately 30 ) , as it depends on the detailed geometry of the buttons and their relative orientations .",
    "half the fibres on each field plate go to one of the two identical spectrographs .",
    "each spectrograph has an f/3.15 off - axis maksutov collimator feeding a 150 mm collimated beam to the grating and then , at an angle of 40 , to an f/1.2 wide - field schmidt camera .",
    "the detectors are tektronix ccds with 1024@xmath11024 24@xmath10 m pixels .",
    "the 200 fibre spectra imaged onto each ccd are separated by approximately 5 pixels .",
    "the 2dfgrs used the 300b gratings , which are blazed at 4200and give a dispersion of 178.8 / mm ( 4.3 / pixel ) . for a typical spectrograph focus of 2.1  pixels ( fwhm )",
    ", this corresponds to a fwhm spectral resolution of 9.0 .",
    "the 2dfgrs observations used a central wavelength around 5800 , and covered the approximate range 36008000 .",
    "flexure is less than 0.2  pixel / hour ( i.e.  less than 40  over a typical integration time ) .",
    "the overall system efficiency ( source to detector ) of 2df with the 300b gratings used in the 2dfgrs is 2.8% at 4400 , 4.3% at 5500  and 4.7% at 7000 .",
    "these figures were obtained from measurements of photometric standard stars , corrected to nominal 1  seeing .",
    "the source catalogue for the survey ( maddox  2001 , in preparation ) is a revised and extended version of the apm galaxy catalogue ( maddox  1990a , b , c;1996 ) .",
    "this catalogue is based on automated plate measuring machine ( apm ) scans of 390 plates from the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) southern sky survey .",
    "the extended version of the apm catalogue includes over 5  million galaxies down to = 20.5 in both north and south galactic hemispheres over a region of almost 10@xmath11deg@xmath2 ( bounded approximately by declination @xmath12@xmath13 + 3  and galactic latitude @xmath8@xmath530 ) .",
    "small regions around bright stars , satellite trails and plate flaws are excluded ; these are accounted for by the survey mask ( see  [ ssec : maglimmask ] ) .",
    "the  magnitude system for the southern sky survey is defined by the response of kodak iiiaj emulsion in combination with a gg395 filter .",
    "it is zeropointed to vega  i.e .",
    "is equal to johnson @xmath14 for an object with zero colour in the johnson ",
    "cousins system .",
    "the colour equation is normally taken to be @xmath15 following blair & gilmore ( 1982 ) .",
    "a larger coefficient ( @xmath16 ) has been suggested by metcalfe  ( 1995 ) , but we measure @xmath17 in comparison with the eso imaging survey ( arnouts  2001 ) , and we therefore retain the usual value of @xmath18 .",
    "the photometry of the catalogue is calibrated with numerous ccd sequences and , for galaxies with = 1719.45 , has a 68% spread of approximately 0.15mag , but with a non - gaussian tail to the error distribution .",
    "we emphasise that the calibration is to _ total _ ccd photometry , which absorbs any remaining correction to the thresholded apm magnitudes .",
    "the star - galaxy separation is as described in maddox  ( 1990b ) , and the locus dividing stars and galaxies was chosen to exclude as few compact galaxies as possible while keeping the contamination of the galaxy sample by stars to about 5% .",
    "spectroscopic identifications of the survey objects ( see  [ sec : redshifts ] ) , show that the stellar contamination is in fact 6% .",
    "the source catalogue is incomplete at all magnitudes due to various effects , including the explicit exclusion of objects classified by the apm as merged images , the misclassification of some galaxies as stars , and the non - detection ( or misclassification as noise ) of some low surface brightness objects .",
    "this incompleteness has been studied in comparisons with deeper wide - area ccd photometry by pimbblet ( 2001 ) and cross & driver ( 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the overall level of incompleteness is 1015% and varies slightly with apparent magnitude , being largest for the brightest and faintest objects .",
    "the main classes of objects that are excluded are : ( i )  merged galaxy images that are explicitly excluded from the 2dfgrs source catalogue ( about 60% of the missing objects ) ; ( ii )  large galaxies that are resolved into components that are classified as stellar , merged or noise objects ( 20% ) ; ( iii )  compact normal galaxies that are detected but classified as stars ( 15% ) ; and ( iv )  low surface brightness galaxies that are either not detected or classified as noise objects ( 5% ) .",
    "thus the main cause of incompleteness is misclassification of objects rather than their non - detection .",
    "the target galaxies for the 2dfgrs were selected to have extinction - corrected magnitudes brighter than = 19.45 .",
    "since the targets were selected , improvements to the photometric calibrations and revised extinction corrections have resulted in slight variations to the magnitude limit over the survey regions  this is precisely quantified by the magnitude limit mask for the survey ( see  [ ssec : maglimmask ] ) .",
    "the  extinction is taken to be @xmath19==4.035@xmath20(@xmath14@xmath21@xmath22 ) , where the coefficient , and the reddening @xmath20(@xmath14@xmath21@xmath22 ) as a function of position , come from schlegel ( 1998 ) .",
    "the limit of = 19.45 was chosen because : ( i )  the surface density of galaxies at = 19.45 ( approximately 165 ) is sufficiently larger than the surface density of 2df fibres on the sky ( 127 ) to allow efficient use of all fibres  few fibres are unused even in low - density fields .",
    "( ii )  the time taken to configure a typical field ( 6065min ) allows , with overheads , a sufficiently long exposure time to reach the desired signal - to - noise level of @xmath4@xmath2310  for galaxies with = 19.45 even in rather poor conditions .",
    "this limiting magnitude corresponds to a median redshift for the survey of about @xmath3=0.1 , so that the 2dfgrs is essentially a survey of the _ local _ universe .",
    "the areas of the sky covered by the survey were chosen so as to satisfy a number of different requirements . the first goal was to cover as large a volume as possible , in order to closely approach a statistically representative sample of the universe on the largest possible scales .",
    "the second was to obtain near - complete sampling down to the survey limit in order to have the finest possible resolution of structure on small scales .",
    "the third requirement was to match the sample to the observational capabilities of the 2df instrument in order to achieve high efficiency .",
    "the adopted geometry is an effective compromise between these requirements .",
    "the survey consists of two separate declination strips of overlapping 2  fields plus 99 scattered ` random ' 2  fields .",
    "one strip ( the sgp strip ) is in the southern galactic hemisphere and covers approximately 80@xmath0@xmath115@xmath0 centred close to the south galactic pole ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "the other strip ( the ngp strip ) is in the northern galactic hemisphere and covers 75@xmath0@xmath110@xmath0 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "the 99 ` random ' fields are chosen from the low - extinction region of the apm catalogue in the southern galactic hemisphere outside the survey strip ( the mean extinction over each field is required to be less than 0.2mag  see figure  2 of efstathiou & moody ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "the fields are chosen pseudo - randomly within this region , except that the field centres are at least 3  apart .",
    "a map of the survey fields on the sky is shown in figure  [ fig : skymap ] ; the locations of the fields with respect to the extinction map derived from schlegel  ( 1998 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : dustmap ] .",
    "all the survey fields lie at galactic latitudes greater than @xmath28=30 , and the whole of the sgp strip and most of the ngp strip and the random fields lie at galactic latitudes greater than @xmath28=45 .    the distribution of extinction corrections as a function of galactic latitude , and the fraction of corrections larger than a given value , are shown in figure  [ fig : extndist ] .",
    "overall , the median correction is 0.07mag , 90% are less than 0.16mag , and 99% are less than 0.26mag ; the corresponding quantiles in the ngp are ( 0.12,0.19,0.28)mag , in the sgp ( 0.05,0.07,0.11)mag and in the random fields ( 0.07,0.13,0.30)mag .",
    "the 2dfgrs target sample of galaxies contains 193550  galaxies in the sgp strip , 139144  galaxies in the ngp strip , and 57019  galaxies in the random fields .",
    "this gives a total of 389713  possible targets , significantly more than the survey goal of 250000 galaxies .",
    "survey observations of the ngp and sgp strips are proceeding outwards in declination from the centre of each strip towards this goal .",
    "note that the total number of galaxies listed in the survey source catalogue ( and the survey database ) is 467214 , which is larger than the number of possible survey targets because the source catalogues for the ngp and sgp strips conservatively includes galaxies fainter than the spectroscopic survey magnitude limit , down to = 19.6 .    at the median redshift of the survey ( @xmath3=0.11 ) the sgp strip extends over 400@xmath175 , and the ngp strip over 375@xmath150 .",
    "out to the effective limit of the survey at @xmath29@xmath300.3 , the strips contain a volume of 1.2@xmath110@xmath31(for @xmath32=0.3 , @xmath33=0.7 ) ; the volume sparsely sampled including the random fields is between two and three times larger .",
    "the survey limit of = 19.45 was chosen , in part , because it gives a good match between the surface density of galaxies and the surface density of 2df fibres . due to clustering",
    ", however , the number of galaxies in a given field varies considerably .",
    "the rms variation in the number of galaxies per randomly - placed 2  field is 140 at = 19.5 , and is largely independent of the choice of magnitude limit over the range considered here . to make efficient use of 2df we therefore require an algorithm for tiling the sky with 2  fields that allows us to cover the survey area at a high , and nearly uniform , sampling rate with the minimum number of 2df fields .",
    "so long as the sampling of the source catalogue is not biased in any way that depends on the photometric or spectroscopic properties of the galaxies , we can always use the source catalogue to accurately determine the sampling rate as a function of position ( see  [ sec : mask ] ) . the sampling",
    "can then be accounted for in any analysis .",
    "however to keep such corrections to a minimum , considerable effort has been invested in making the sampling as complete and uniform as possible .",
    "there are a number of possible approaches to laying down target field centres .",
    "the simplest is to adopt a uniform grid of equally spaced centres and then either randomly sample each field with the number of available fibres or observe each field several times until all the galaxies have been observed .",
    "the second of these options is clearly inefficient , as it will give rise to a large number of fields being observed with significantly less than the full complement of fibres , while the first is undesirable as it gives a different sampling factor for each field .",
    "a more efficient solution is to use an adaptive tiling strategy , where we allow each field centre to drift from the regular grid so that we maximise the number of targets that are assigned to each field , subject to the constraint that the number of targets assigned to any one field should not exceed the number of available fibres , @xmath34 .",
    "we begin with a uniform grid with field centres equally spaced by @xmath35 in right ascension along rows 1.5  apart in declination . for each galaxy in the survey",
    "we then determine how many fields it lies within , and assign each field a weight @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the number of galaxies in this field .",
    "these weights are normalised such that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of fields that this galaxy could be assigned to .",
    "the galaxy in question is then randomly assigned to one of the fields using these weights , unless all the fields are already filled , in which case it is assigned to the first field in which it was found . once all the field occupancies have been determined in this way we move each field in right ascension by an amount @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the maximum allowed separation between adjacent fields , @xmath43 is the current distance to the neighbouring field centre , and @xmath44 is the cumulative shift that has currently been applied to this row .",
    "new fields are added at the end of each row if the total length of the row has contracted enough to exclude any galaxies at the trailing edge .",
    "we found that using a fixed separation of 1.5  in declination , and adjusting the tile positions in right ascension only , provided sufficient flexibility to achieve uniform high completeness without a large increase in the total number of fields and without leaving gaps in the sky coverage .    in practice , it is found that the above prescription requires a further modification to account for the position of each object within the field .",
    "this additional constraint arises because of the physical restrictions on the positioning of individual fibres , both in terms of their deviation from the radial angle and their extension from the parked position at the edge of the field .",
    "we apply this constraint by dividing each field into 36 sub - fields and restricting the number of targets that can be assigned to each sub - field to 16 .",
    "this is larger than the number of fibres whose park positions fall within the arc of the sector , but allows for the fact that the area of the field that can be reached by each fibre is increasing with the fibre extension . without this extra constraint",
    "the algorithm tends to place large clusters in the overlapping areas of neighbouring fields where , although there are more available fibres because of the overlap , it rapidly becomes impossible to use these fibres because of the high density of targets close to the edge of each field .",
    "limiting the number of targets within each sector effectively removes this problem , and so increases the uniformity of the survey completeness .",
    "the adaptive tiling algorithm also needed to cope with the requirement that the galaxy redshift survey be merged with the concurrent survey of qso candidates ( the 2df qso redshift survey : boyle  2000 ; croom  2001 ) .",
    "this results in a higher surface density of targets in the region of overlap , for which we compensate by reducing the separation in declination of the tiling strips in the qso survey regions to 75% of the original value ( i.e.  to 1.125 ) .",
    "as the qso survey occupies the central declination strip of our sgp survey region this results in a 3 - 4 - 3 arrangement of tiling strips over the three rows of ukst fields used in the sgp survey .",
    "a similar consideration applied to the ngp survey region gives a 3 - 4 arrangement if we consider the full areas of the two rows of ukst fields used .    with these additional modifications ,",
    "our tiling algorithm was able to achieve an overall sampling rate of 99.8% , dropping to 93% after the assignment of fibres to targets has been made ( see  [ ssec : fibrecomplete ] ) .",
    "on average , fewer than 5% of the fibres in each field were unused . for comparison ,",
    "the mean sampling rate that would be achieved for randomly distributed fields is 68% , with an rms variation of 15% .",
    "the tiling procedure described above fixes the location of the 2df target fields on the sky and provides a first pass priority scheme ( based on the random field assignments ) for use in assigning targets to fibres .",
    "however , the mechanical constraints of 2df imply that we can not usually allocate fibres to all the targets assigned to a particular field , and so we consider all targets that lie within each field boundary .",
    "our tiling scheme implies that many of the survey targets are found on more than one field , so we adopt a priority scheme as follows : targets which are unique to the field in question are assigned the highest priority , then targets which are assigned to the field , but which can also be reached from neighbouring fields , then targets which fall within the field , but which are assigned to a different , overlapping field .",
    "the priorities of the qso targets are increased one step to ensure that we do not imprint the strong clustering pattern of the galaxy distribution on the weak clustering expected from the qso sample .",
    "the allocation procedure for a single field can be divided into two distinct steps : an initial allocation pass and a fibre swapping pass .",
    "these two steps are repeated for each range of decreasing priorities for targets that have been assigned to this field .",
    "an attempt is then made to reduce the complexity of the configuration by identifying pairs of allocated fibres which are crossed , and which can safely be exchanged .",
    "the allocation and uncrossing steps are then repeated to allow consideration of the lower priority targets which were not assigned to this field",
    ". the details of these steps are as follows :    ( 1 )  _ initial allocation pass .",
    "_ for each target , @xmath45 , of a given priority we determine the set , @xmath46 , of all fibres that could be allocated to that target in the absence of any other allocations .",
    "we then determine the set , @xmath47 , of all targets which fall within the sector defined by the target and the two most extreme fibres in @xmath46 .",
    "we then use the difference @xmath48 between the number of targets in @xmath47 and the number of fibres in @xmath46 to determine which targets are hardest to access and hence should be given the highest priority : targets within the sector defined by the target with the largest value of @xmath49 are allocated first .",
    "this procedure is then repeated for targets of successively lower priorities .",
    "( 2 )  _ fibre - swapping pass .",
    "_ for each remaining unallocated target , @xmath50 , we now consider each fibre in @xmath51",
    ". for each fibre in this set that could still be allocated to @xmath50 given the current configuration we make a tentative re - allocation of this fibre from its initial assignment , @xmath52 , to target @xmath50 and check to see if any unallocated fibres can be assigned to @xmath52 .",
    "if no unallocated fibres can be assigned we repeat this process recursively until one of the following conditions have been satisfied : either ( i )  a previously unallocated fibre is allocated ( implying that @xmath50 has been allocated and that all previously allocated targets remain allocated ) ; or ( ii )  the search exceeds a depth of 10 iterations . in the latter case , if at any point in the search a fibre has been moved from a low - priority target such that a target of higher priority has been allocated then the search is unpacked to this point ; if no such trade - off was found then the search is unpacked to the original configuration .",
    "( 3 )  _ fibre - uncrossing pass . _",
    "each pair of fibres in the configuration is tested to see if the fibres cross . for each",
    "crossed pair an attempt is made to swap the allocations of fibres to targets .",
    "this process is iterated until no further swaps can be made .",
    "the net effect of this procedure is that the final configuration supplied to the positioner is simplified so that the transition to the _ following _ configuration will require fewer fibres to be moved twice .",
    "this simplification effectively reduces the time required for each re - configuration , and is achieved without constraint on the allocation .",
    "while the above procedure provides an optimised method of allocating as many fibres as possible to a given individual field , it does not make optimal use of the flexibility provided by the overlapping fields .",
    "we therefore ran a second pass of the configuration algorithm which considered each pair of overlapping fields as an 800 fibre problem in which all objects found within the overlap area are matched up , so that an object which is allocated in one field can be allocated to the second field to allow acquisition of unallocated targets in the first field . compared to the results of treating the two overlapping fields as separate configuration problems",
    ", this procedure proves more effective at reducing the overall incompleteness due to the instrumental constraints .",
    "since the tiling algorithm tends to place local over - densities close to the edges of tiles , this procedure also serves to homogenise the distribution of incompleteness as a function of position within a field .",
    "a significant fraction of this incompleteness arises due to close pairs of objects which lie within the unique regions of individual fields .",
    "the separation at which this occurs is a strong function of the relative orientation of the two fibre buttons ( see lewis  2001 ) .",
    "the upper limit on the value of this separation is 11 mm in the focal plane ( corresponding to 2.2 ) , while the mean separation of close pairs of objects for which one target can not be assigned is @xmath5330 .",
    "the results of this procedure are that we are able to allocate fibres to 93% of the source catalogue objects .",
    "the distribution of the unallocated objects on the sky are shown in figure  [ fig : unallocsky ] .",
    "the most prominent features visible in these distributions are occasional localised clusters of unallocated objects .",
    "these are due to over - dense regions where the geometrical packing constraints imposed by the fibre button dimensions mean that it has not been possible to assign every fibre to a target , even though there are enough fibres available as a result of the tiling algorithm .",
    "this effect is enhanced by the relative increase in the number of close pairs in strongly clustered regions .",
    "the distribution of these unallocated objects is also shown as a function of position within the 2df field in figure  [ fig : unallocplate ] .",
    "this plot shows a slight overall gradient in the r.a .",
    "direction , which is due to the order in which the field overlaps are processed ( see  [ ssec : fieldoverlap ] ) .",
    "this apparent gradient is misleading , since the missed objects are plotted according to the field plate coordinates on the plate to which they were assigned , whereas the majority of objects which contribute to this effect are actually missed on more than one 2df field .",
    "the next most prominent feature of figure  [ fig : unallocplate ] is the imprint of the four fibres which are used for field acquisition and guiding .",
    "these fibres must be allocated with a higher priority than the targets if the field is to be observed successfully .",
    "they prevent the subsequent allocation of target objects lying along their length , and so produce a slight increase in the numbers of unallocated objects along the four cardinal axes of the field , in the regions of the plate where they can be placed .",
    "it should be noted that these figures do not represent the final incompleteness in the survey , since individual target allocations are adjusted immediately prior to observation to account for the actual number of fibres available to 2df on any given night ( typically , about 1% of the fibres are broken at any given time , though they are continually replaced ) .",
    "the overall incompleteness at this stage , before any observations have been made , is 7% .",
    "the level of this incompleteness is such that the pattern is dominated by residuals due to clustering within individual two - degree fields , implying that an attempt to correct for this effect would effectively imprint the observed pattern onto the data .",
    "we therefore conclude that we have achieved our goal of reducing the mean incompleteness to an acceptably low level , comparable to the level of incompleteness due to the individual uncertainties in galaxy magnitudes and the incompleteness due to not measuring redshifts because of inadequate signal - to - noise . we emphasise that neither the tiling nor the fibre allocation depend on the photometric or spectroscopic properties of the objects , so that we can use the source catalogue to accurately determine the sampling of the survey , as discussed in  [ sec : mask ] ) .",
    "postage stamp images of each target galaxy and each candidate fiducial star were generated from the digitized sky survey ( dss ; lasker 1998 ) .",
    "these dss images were used to examine the target galaxies for merged images and to remove unsuitable fiducial star candidates .",
    "the apm image classification parameter @xmath54 ( see maddox  1990b ) was used to find target galaxies which might possibly be merged images .",
    "objects with @xmath54@xmath231.15 in the sgp and @xmath54@xmath231.2 in the ngp were analysed by a simple routine which attempts to relocate the fibre onto the local maximum of surface brightness closest to the nominal target position .",
    "this is achieved by starting from the central pixel of the dss image and allowing the position to move in a direction of increasing intensity until a local maximum is found . the position corresponding to this local maximum is then inserted into the 2df configuration file prior to observation .",
    "all objects which are tested in this way are flagged as merged images by changing the second character of the object s obsname parameter from g to m , even if the final position of the fibre is unchanged .",
    "the survey database records both the original source catalogue position ( database parameters ra and dec ; see  [ ssec : database])and the actual observed position ( database parameters obsra and obsdec ) ; the parameter match_dr gives the offset ( in arcsec ) between these two positions , and may be non - zero for objects flagged as mergers .",
    "the dss images of candidate fiducial stars are inspected visually to allow removal of the following types of object , which would compromise field acquisition : ( i )  stars which are merged with another object ; ( ii )  stars which are close to other stars of comparable brightness ; ( iii )  bright stars which are strongly saturated on the sky survey plates ; ( iv )  spurious objects that are fragments of the diffraction spikes or halos of bright stars , or bright regions within large galaxies ; ( v )  asteroids and portions of satellite trails ; ( vi )  spurious objects due to noise .",
    "the configuration procedure described above determines the optimal assignment of fibres to targets over the whole survey .",
    "this procedure assumes a fixed set of parameters for the transformation of sky - coordinates to plate - coordinates , whereas in practice a slightly different transform is determined each time the instrument is mounted on the telescope .",
    "the above procedure also assumes a full complement of fibres , and does not allow for the small but significant attrition rate as fibres are disabled due to optical or mechanical failures .",
    "fibres which are disabled in this way are repaired on a regular basis , but operational constraints require that disabled fibres are replaced in batches , and so there is generally some delay before a particular fibre is replaced",
    ".    we account for both the fibre attrition and the effects of changes to the coordinate transform by re - examining each configuration the day before that field is to be observed .",
    "all broken or inoperative fibres which had been allocated are deallocated and the targets to which they were assigned are flagged .",
    "an attempt is then made to recover each flagged target using the current list of available fibres , according to the same algorithm used for the original allocation . again , low - priority targets may be lost at this stage in favour of high - priority targets . in practice",
    ", we usually find that the majority of the high - priority targets which were flagged can either be recovered or replaced .",
    "a similar check is then made to allow for a further change to the coordinate transform due to the hour angle at which the field is to be observed .",
    "this correction is a combination of the effects of atmospheric refraction and flexure and misalignment of the telescope itself .",
    "each configuration is checked for hour angles of @xmath554  hours , and adjustments are made to ensure that no fibre conflicts will occur within this range .",
    "again , we usually find that all such conflicts can be recovered without loss of target allocations .    after this correction to the configuration , a number of unallocated fibres ( at least 10 for each spectrograph )",
    "are allocated to blank sky positions .",
    "this is done initially using an azimuthally symmetrical grid of positions around the field , but if insufficient fibres can be allocated to this grid , more are allocated to other blank sky regions manually .",
    "the position of each allocated sky position is then checked to ensure that it is genuinely blank by examining the surrounding area using the digitized sky survey .",
    "any sky fibres likely to be contaminated by objects visible on the dss are reallocated to other blank sky regions .",
    "a target field is acquired using the four guide fibres , each of which consists of 6 fibres in a hexagonal pattern surrounding a central fibre .",
    "the individual fibres are 95@xmath10 m ( 1.4 ) in diameter and have centre - to - centre separations of 1.8 .",
    "these guide fibres are positioned on 14@xmath56@xmath22@xmath5615 stars with positions measured from the same ukst plates as the target galaxies . as the blue sky",
    "survey plates are often 2025 years old , we use the more recent red sky survey plates to check for any proper motion , and we also apply a colour cut to reduce the number of nearby stars . on some fields , where red plates are not available",
    ", we have used fiducial stars from the usno a1.0 astrometric catalogue ( monet  1996 ) .",
    "the guide fibres are viewed by the aat s standard acquisition and guiding tv system . the position for optimum acquisition of the fiducial stars , and subsequent guiding corrections ,",
    "are determined by visual inspection of the locations of the stars in the guide fibres on the tv image .",
    "acquisition of a new field typically requires less than 5  minutes .    for each field",
    "we first take a multi - fibre flat - field exposure using the quartz lamp in the calibration unit .",
    "this flat - field is used to trace the positions of the fibres on the image , to fit the spatial profile of each fibre as a function of wavelength , and to apply a 1-dimensional pixel - to - pixel flat - field correction to the extracted spectra .",
    "we next take a wavelength calibration exposure of helium and copper - argon arc lamps .",
    "we then typically take three 1100s exposures of the target objects .",
    "however the exposure time is varied to suit the conditions : for galaxy - only fields in good conditions , three 900s exposures are sufficient ; in poor conditions , especially for fields including targets from the qso survey , a longer total integration time is used . with the ccd readout time of 60s",
    ", the whole series of exposures typically takes just over an hour , so that the observations of one field are finished just as the configuration for the next field is completed .",
    "the data are reduced using the 2df data reduction pipeline software , , a full description of which is given by bailey  ( 2001 ; see also http://www.aao.gov.au/2df ) .",
    "the main steps in the process are as follows :    \\1 . _",
    "basic image processing .",
    "_ each image undergoes the same initial processing , which consists of flagging bad pixels ( both saturated pixels and those specified in the bad - pixel mask for each ccd ) .",
    "the bias level is computed as the median of the ccd overscan region and subtracted from the image .",
    "the image is then trimmed to remove the overscan region . finally , a variance array is computed based on the pixel data values and the known properties of the ccds .",
    "the variances are propagated through all subsequent reduction steps .",
    "_ mapping the spectra .",
    "_ the next step is to map the locations and shapes of the spectra on the detector .",
    "the centroids of the fibre spectra along the slit are determined using the fibre flat field image , and the fibre identifications checked visually .",
    "this is necessary because the positioning of the slit block is not precisely reproducible , so that the locations of the fibres on the ccd can change by a few pixels , and occasionally the first or last fibre may fall off the edge of the detector .",
    "visual checking ensures that spectra are correctly identified with fibres and thus with the objects that were observed . given this starting location ,",
    "finds the centroids of each fibre spectrum as a function of wavelength and fits a model based on the known optical properties of the spectrograph .",
    "for each subsequent frame , this model is adjusted ( to account for flexure ) by fitting an overall shift and rotation to the positions of the spectra on the detector .",
    "_ subtracting the background .",
    "_ the background of scattered light is fitted with an empirically - determined model using the unilluminated portions of the detector .",
    "fibres are so closely packed on the detector that the light level between transmitting fibres does not drop to the background level .",
    "hence the only unilluminated areas are at the edges of the detector and at the positions of dead ( broken , non - transmitting ) fibres .",
    "a small number of fibres are broken at any one time and are continually being replaced .",
    "occasionally the number of broken fibres becomes sufficiently small that it is not possible to reliably fit the background , and this step must be omitted .",
    "_ fitting the spatial profiles . _",
    "the close packing of the fibres on the detector means that their spatial profiles overlap , producing cross - talk between neighbouring spectra . in order to correct for this , it is necessary to know the spatial profile of each fibre spectrum as a function of wavelength .",
    "these profiles are determined from the fibre flat field image by performing simultaneous fits of 200 gaussians to the fibre profiles at each of 20 wavelength ranges .",
    "these fits are then interpolated in the wavelength direction with cubic splines to give the spatial profile for each fibre at every wavelength on the detector .",
    "_ spectrum extraction . _ given the location and shape of each fibre s spatial profile , optimal extraction consists of a weighted fit of the profiles to recover the amplitude of the spectrum at each wavelength . because the spectra overlap , a simultaneous fit of the profile amplitudes of each fibre spectrum and its nearest neighbour on either side is carried out .",
    "the fit is performed using least - squares with variance weighting .",
    "_ flat - fielding .",
    "_ the extracted spectra are then ` flat - fielded ' by dividing by the pixel - to - pixel variations in the extracted spectra from the fibre flat field image .",
    "this one - dimensional flat - fielding is used because there is presently no means of generating a full two - dimensional flat - field image .",
    ". _ wavelength calibration and linearisation .",
    "_ a predicted wavelength for each pixel , based on the nominal central wavelength and the optical model for the spectrograph , is first calculated .",
    "lines in the helium / argon arc spectra are automatically identified by a peak - finding algorithm , then matched to a list of known lines , discarding both unidentified peaks and unmatched lines , as as well as known blends .",
    "the relation between the measured line positions and their true wavelengths is fit by a third - order polynomial .",
    "this fit iterated up to four times , with the most discrepant line excluded at each iteration .",
    "the final fits usually include 2122 lines over the 4400  spectral range , and have typical rms residuals of 0.3  ( 0.07 pixels ) . once the wavelength calibration is determined , the spectrum is re - binned onto a linear wavelength scale using quadratic interpolation .",
    "_ fibre throughput calibration .",
    "_ the spectrum of the sky background is measured with at least 8 fibres ( and usually more ) on each of the two spectrographs .",
    "the spectra from the sky fibres are normalised by their mean fluxes and a median sky spectrum is calculated .",
    "the relative throughputs of the fibres are then derived from the relative fluxes in the strong sky lines as follows .",
    "all object and sky fibres and the median sky are continuum - subtracted using a continuum derived by median smoothing with a 201-pixel box .",
    "this removes the continuum leaving only the strong lines in the residual spectrum .",
    "a robust least - squares fit to the constant of proportionality between the counts in each pixel of the residual object+sky spectrum and the residual median sky spectrum then yields the relative throughput for each fibre ( the sky lines in common to both spectra contribute to the fit , but strong emission lines found only in the object spectrum do not ) .",
    "the individual object and sky spectra are then normalised by dividing by their relative throughputs .",
    "_ sky subtraction . _",
    "the median sky spectrum is re - calculated from the individual normalised sky spectra , and subtracted from each normalised object and sky spectrum .",
    "the sky - subtraction precision , measured as the ratio of the total flux in the sky fibres before and after sky - subtraction , is typically 23% and rarely",
    "worse than 6% .",
    "precise sky - subtraction is dependent on effective scattered light subtraction , wavelength calibration and throughput calibration .",
    "_ combining spectra . _ the fully - reduced spectra from each of the multiple exposures on the target objects ( typically three )",
    "are optimally combined in a final step .",
    "the combination algorithm accounts for overall flux variations between exposures ( due to different integration times or observing conditions ) and rejects cosmic ray events .",
    "the relative weighting of the exposures is computed from the total fluxes in the brightest 5% of the spectra ( after they are median - smoothed over a 201-pixel box to eliminate cosmic rays and normalised to the first exposure ) .",
    "the maximum flux weight is unity , and the weights are applied to the individual exposures before they compared for cosmic rays .",
    "the cosmic ray rejection algorithm is similar to that of the iraf crreject package .",
    "it flags likely cosmic ray events , which are taken to be those pixels that are more than 5@xmath57 deviations from the median ( over the set of flux - weighted exposures ) together with some neighbouring pixels .",
    "the final pixel value in the combined spectrum is computed as the variance - weighted mean over the flux - weighted exposures of the unflagged pixels .",
    "the final result of the reduction is a pair of data files ( one for each ccd ) , both of which contain a multi - spectrum image ( 200 fibres @xmath1 1024 spectral pixels ) , the associated variance array ( which is correctly propagated throughout the reduction process ) , and a copy of the median sky spectrum used in the background subtraction .",
    "the data files also contain the identifications of the spectra obtained from the fibre configuration file and detailed information about the instrument and observation .",
    "the spectra are not flux - calibrated .",
    "flux calibration of fibre spectra is very difficult to achieve for a number of reasons .",
    "chief among these are : ( i )  astrometric / positioning errors , which , combined with the small fibre aperture , prevent reproducible sampling of each galaxy s light distribution ; ( ii )  chromatic variations in distortion ( see  [ sec : instrument ] ) and residual errors in the atmospheric dispersion correction , which produce variations in the flux calibration dependent on the attitude of the telescope and the position of the object in the field .",
    "these effects can produce significant variations in the continuum slope of the spectra , and are discussed in quantitative detail in madgwick  ( 2001b ) and madgwick  ( 2001c , in preparation ) .",
    "various problems are exhibited by some of the spectra : ( i )  _ poor sky - subtraction .",
    "_ a small but significant fraction of fields suffered sky - subtraction errors of more than 5% .",
    "the strong oxygen sky lines at 5577 , 6300 , 6363  and the oh bands to the red of 6000  leave significant residuals in the spectra .",
    "( ii )  _ fringing . _",
    "damaged fibres sometimes produce a fringing effect that results in a strong oscillation in the throughput with wavelength .",
    "( iii )  _ halation .",
    "_ sometimes halation due to condensation on the field flattener lens just in front of the ccd results in a high level of scattered light which fills in absorption features ; when present , this effect was worse in ccd camera # 2 .",
    "( iv )  _ adc error .",
    "_ a software error meant that the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) was incorrectly positioned for observations prior to 31 august 1999 ; some of the spectra obtained before this date suffer from significant atmospheric dispersion losses .",
    "the main parameter to be determined from the spectra was the redshift of each object .",
    "a sophisticated and highly - tuned redshift code was developed in order to achieve a high level of precision , reliability and automation in the measurement of redshifts from the 2dfgrs spectral data .",
    "the redshift code ( version 990505 ) uses two quasi - independent automated methods : ` absorption ' redshifts are obtained by cross - correlation with template spectra ( after clipping emission lines ) and ` emission ' redshifts are obtained by finding and fitting emission lines .",
    "these automated redshift estimates are followed by a visual check and ( occasionally , where necessary ) a ` manual ' redshift obtained by fitting identified spectral features .",
    "before these redshift estimates are made , however , the spectra are pre - processed in a number of ways .",
    "residual features from the strong atmospheric emission lines at 5577 , 5893 , 6300  and 7244are masked by interpolating over a small wavelength range ( 2030 ) centred on the sky line .",
    "the atmospheric absorption bands around 6870  ( b - band ) and 7600  ( a - band ) , and the fibre absorption band around 7190 , are removed by dividing by an approximate band correction .",
    "this correction is obtained by fitting a low - order polynomial to the mean of all the spectra in the reduced image , dividing the mean spectrum by this smooth fit , finding the region about each band centre where this ratio is less than unity , and setting the band correction to the value of this ratio in these regions and to unity elsewhere .",
    "the spectra , which are not flux - calibrated , are finally multiplied by a simple quadratic approximation to the mean flux calibration correction in order to give appropriate weighting across the whole spectral range .",
    "an ` absorption ' redshift is obtained by cross - correlating the galaxy spectrum against a suite of 8 template spectra following the general method of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the templates that are used cover a broad range of spectral types , and include 5 galaxies and 3 stars .",
    "the galaxies ( and their morphological types ) are : 1 .",
    "ngc3379 ( e ) , 2 .",
    "ngc4889 ( cd ) , 3 .",
    "ngc5248 ( sbc ) , 4 .",

    "bd051668 ( m5v ) .",
    "the galaxy spectra come from spectrophotometric atlas of kennicutt ( 1992 ) ; the stellar spectra come from the library of jacoby  ( 1984 ) .",
    "the full set of template spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : tempspec ] .",
    "the galaxy and template spectra are prepared for cross - correlation using the following steps : ( 1 )  continuum - subtraction using a sixth - order polynomial fit to the continuum ; ( 2 )  removal of strong emission lines by patching out all points more than 5 times the rms variation above the mean ; ( 3 )  re - binning to a logarithmic wavelength scale with 2048 pixels ; ( 4 ) apodising ( tapering the ends of the spectrum to zero ) by multiplying the first and last 5% of the spectrum with a cosine bell ; ( 5 )  fourier transformation ; and , finally , ( 6 )  multiplication by an exponential filter of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath54 is wavenumber in inverse pixels , @xmath59=300  and @xmath60=15 , in order to reduce the effects of both the residual continuum at low wavenumber and the noise at high wavenumber .",
    "the cross - correlation function is then computed as the inverse fourier transform of the complex product of the filter fourier transforms of the processed galaxy and template spectra .",
    "the highest peak in cross - correlation function is fitted with a quadratic in order to obtain the position and height of the peak .",
    "the significance of the peak is measured in terms of the ratio , @xmath61 , of the height of the peak to the noise in the cross - correlation function , which is estimated from its anti - symmetric part .",
    "the absorption redshift is taken to be the cross - correlation redshift obtained with the template giving the highest value of @xmath61 .",
    "an estimate of the quality of the absorption redshift , q@xmath62 , is based on the value of @xmath61 , with q@xmath62=1,2,3,4 for @xmath61@xmath233.5,4.0,4.5,5.0 and q@xmath62=0 otherwise ( with the additional requirement that q@xmath62=3 and q@xmath62=4 also require , respectively , at least 4 and 6 of the 8 templates give the same redshift to within 600 ) .",
    "an ` emission ' redshift is obtained by fitting gaussians to significant spectral features and searching for a multi - line match .",
    "the galaxy spectrum is first continuum - subtracted using a sixth - order polynomial fit to the continuum and lightly smoothed with a gaussian kernel having a dispersion of 0.8  pixels .",
    "peaks in the smoothed spectrum above a threshold ( set at 3.3 times the robustly - estimated rms variation ) are flagged as candidate emission lines .",
    "for each of these , in descending order of strength , a gaussian is then fitted to the unsmoothed data , using the peak in the smoothed spectrum as the initial guess for the line centre .",
    "the gaussian fits to the stronger lines are subtracted in turn before the weaker lines are fitted ( to minimize blending effects in the h@xmath63/nii pair )",
    ". then lines with fitted fwhm between 0.7 and 7 pixels , and total ` significance ' of the whole line above 3.5@xmath57 are marked as ` good ' ; this rejects unclipped cosmic rays and low - significance features .",
    "the ` good ' lines are then sorted by strength , and the three strongest tested to see if at least two can be identified as common emission lines ( [ oii]3727 , h@xmath644861 , [ oiii]5007 , h@xmath636563or [ nii]6584 ) at a single redshift ( the two out of three criterion is used to allow for one spurious feature , such as a residual sky line or cosmic ray ) .",
    "if so , then all the other lines in this set ( plus [ oiii]4959 ) that match this redshift to better than 600  are found and the mean redshift from these matching lines is adopted as the emission redshift . if not , then up to two possible single - line redshifts are kept for comparison with the absorption redshift , assuming the single line is either [ oii ] or h@xmath63 in the range 0@xmath56@xmath29@xmath560.4 , as appropriate .",
    "an estimate of the quality of the emission redshift , q@xmath65 , is based on the number and strength of the lines from which it is determined , with q@xmath65=0 if there are no lines , q@xmath65=1 for one weak line , q@xmath65=2 for any two lines or one strong line , and q@xmath65=4 for three or more lines .",
    "the penultimate step is the choice of the best automated redshift estimate , given the absorption and emission redshifts and their quality parameters .",
    "the best redshift is taken to be whichever of the absorption and emission redshifts has the higher quality parameter ( with the absorption redshift preferred if q@xmath62=q@xmath65 ) .",
    "the best estimate of the redshift quality is q@xmath66=max(q@xmath62,q@xmath65 ) , with two exceptions : ( i )  if the difference between the absorption and emission redshifts is less than 600  then q@xmath66=max(q@xmath62,q@xmath65,3 ) ; and ( ii )  if q@xmath62@xmath52 and q@xmath65@xmath52 and the difference between the absorption and emission redshifts is greater than 600 , then this discrepancy is flagged and we set q@xmath66=1 .",
    "the final step in measuring the redshift is a visual check of the best automatic redshift .",
    "the redshift code displays for the user both the cross - correlation function and the galaxy spectrum with all the common spectral features superposed at the best automatic redshift .",
    "the spectrum displayed is the version actually used for the redshift estimate , with bad pixels and the strongest night sky lines patched out , and with an approximate correction applied for the instrumental response . to assist in identifying spurious features",
    "the code also displays the mean sky spectrum ( to show the positions of the sky features ) , the atmospheric absorption bands and the variance array associated with the spectrum .",
    "the user is given the emission and/or absorption line redshifts , the best - estimate redshift , whether this is an emission or absorption redshift ( or both ) , and whether ( if both are obtained ) the emission and absorption redshifts agree or not .",
    "if neither of the automated estimates are correct , the user can manually estimate a redshift by identifying a particular spectral feature and fitting gaussians at the positions of all the common features .",
    "these fits can be to emission or absorption features and are rejected if there is no detectable feature near the nominal position .",
    "the manual redshift is taken to be the mean of the redshifts estimated from each of the well - fitted features .",
    "given all this information , the observer can visually inspect the spectrum , try alternative redshifts ( absorption , emission and manual ) and determine the best redshift estimate .",
    "once the final redshift estimate has been decided , the user assigns a quality , q , to this redshift on a five - point scale , with the nominal interpretation ( see below for further discussion ) : q=1 means no redshift could be estimated ; q=2 means a possible , but doubtful , redshift estimate ; q=3 means a ` probable ' redshift ( notionally 90% confidence ) ; q=4 means a reliable redshift ( notionally 99% confidence ) ; q=5 means a reliable redshift and a high - quality spectrum .",
    "note that this quality parameter is determined entirely by the subjective judgement of the user , and is independent of the automatic quality parameter q@xmath66 .",
    "quality classes 1 and 2 are considered failures , so the redshift completeness is the number of q=3,4,5 redshifts divided by the total number of galaxies in the field .",
    "the standard redshift sample comprises objects with q@xmath53 , but ( for applications where redshift reliability is more important than completeness ) one may prefer to use the set of objects with q@xmath54 .    for the objects ending up with ` acceptable ' ( q=3,4,5 ) redshifts ,",
    "the best automated redshift is the same as the best visual redshift about 93% of the time ; about 5% of the time either the absorption or the emission redshift agrees with the best visual redshift but the code has preferred the other one ; and about 2% of the time neither of the estimates matches the best visual redshift , and a manual redshift estimate is required .",
    "while there is some element of subjectivity in deciding whether a redshift estimate is ` acceptable ' or not , this visual assessment is found to improve the reliability of the final sample , since the observer can assess a number of factors that are hard to fully automate , such as the overall shape of the spectrum , line ratios , the general quality of sky subtraction , and the proximity of features to sky lines or absorption bands . for 15,000 spectra ,",
    "two or more users have measured redshifts independently using the same redshift code on the same spectra ; the pair - wise ` blunder ' rate ( see below ) is 0.4% , which is several times smaller than that for different observations of the same object .",
    "the rms difference in redshift completeness ( fraction of objects per field with q@xmath53 ) between two users for the same data is less than half of that between the _ same _ observer measuring redshifts for many different fields .",
    "the human variation is therefore substantially smaller than the unavoidable variation between fields due to weather and other effects , and will to first order be corrected by the completeness factors .",
    "a quantitative overall measure of spectral quality is the median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per pixel computed over all pixels in the wavelength range 40007500  with fluxes greater than zero .",
    "this is computed directly from the spectrum and it associated variance array , and can be compared to the quality class q assigned to the redshift identification .",
    "the distribution of s / n over the 5 quality classes for the best spectrum of each object ( i.e.  the spectrum on which the adopted redshift is based ) is shown in figure  [ fig : snr ] .",
    "the fraction of objects in each quality class and the median s / n for each quality class are given in the figure legend .",
    "objects with reliable redshifts ( q=3,4,5 ) make up 91.8% of the sample and have a median s / n of 13.1  ( 6.3@xmath67 ) .",
    "example 2dfgrs spectra for quality classes q=3 , q=4 and q=5 are shown in figure  [ fig : galspec ] ; for each quality class , one object with an absorption redshift and one object with an emission redshift are shown . in order to be representative ,",
    "the spectra are chosen to have a s / n per pixel close to the median of their quality class .",
    "residuals from the strong night sky lines at 5577  and 6300  have been interpolated over .      amongst the first 150000 galaxies in the survey with redshifts , there are 8480 repeat redshift measurements ; i.e.  a second , or even a third , reliable ( q=3,4,5 ) redshift measurement for an object .",
    "these repeat measurements are either objects that lie in the overlaps between fields ( 7444 cases ) or are in fields which were observed more than once , usually because the first observation was of poor quality and low completeness ( 1036 cases ) . for these objects",
    "we can compare their best redshift measurement with the repeat measurements to estimate both the rate of incorrect redshift identifications in the survey and the uncertainties on the correct redshift identifications .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : repeats ] shows the distribution of the redshift differences ( w.r.t .  the best redshift measurement for the object ) for all the repeat observations . the rms redshift difference ( robustly estimated here and throughout as the half - width of the central 68% of the distribution ) is 120 , implying an overall single - measurement rms uncertainty of 85 .",
    "the lower panels of the figure show the trends in the redshift uncertainty as a function of redshift , magnitude , s / n and quality class q. as expected , the uncertainties increase at higher redshifts ( from 95  for @xmath29@xmath560.05 to 150  at @xmath29@xmath230.15 ) , fainter magnitudes ( from 100  for @xmath5618.5 to 140  for @xmath2319.3 ) and lower s / n ( from 95  for s / n@xmath2325 to 145  for s / n@xmath565 ) .",
    "the strongest trends are with redshift quality class and the method of estimating the redshift .",
    "table  [ tab : repeats ] gives the rms precision of single measurements as function of redshift quality class or measurement method ( abs = cross - correlation of absorption features ; emi = automatic fit to emission lines ; man = manual fit to features ) .",
    "the fact that manual redshift estimation has the largest uncertainties mainly reflects the fact that it is only employed when the automatic methods have failed , usually in cases of low s / n .",

    ", the shape of the observed power spectrum will be close to that of the linear density perturbations convolved with the window function of the survey .",
    "fitting convolved power spectrum models constrains the shape parameter @xmath71 to be @xmath72 ( 68% confidence level ) and shows that models containing baryon oscillations are preferred over models without baryons at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this is the first detection of baryon oscillations in the galaxy distribution , and yields an estimate for the baryon fraction @xmath73 , assuming scale - invariant primordial fluctuations .",
    "the size of the 2dfgrs sample has allowed investigation of the variation in the strength of galaxy clustering with luminosity , using the projected two - point correlation function of galaxies in a series of volume - limited samples ( norberg  2001a ) .",
    "the clustering of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) galaxies in real space is well fitted by a power - law relation with exponent @xmath76 and a correlation length @xmath77 .",
    "the exponent shows very little variation for galaxy samples with luminosities differing by a factor of 40 .",
    "the clustering amplitude , however , increases with luminosity : slowly for galaxies fainter than @xmath78 , but more strongly at brighter absolute magnitudes .",
    "this dependence of the correlation length on luminosity is in good agreement with the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation models of benson  ( 2001 ) . in terms of the bias parameter ,",

    "principal component analysis has been applied to the 2dfgrs spectra , and a linear combination of the first two principal components , @xmath83 , has been used to parametrise the spectral type . going from early types to late types ,",
    "the luminosity functions appear to exhibit a systematic decrease in the characteristic luminosity ( from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ) and a steepening of the faint - end slope ( from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ) .",
    "however there is also evidence that , at the precision afforded by the 2dfgrs sample , the standard schechter fitting function is no longer an adequate representation of the luminosity function .",
    "figure  [ fig : etacones ] shows the redshift slices for each of the four spectral types defined in terms of the @xmath83 parameter by madgwick  ( 2001a ) : type  1 are the earliest types and type  4 the latest types .",
    "the association of earlier types with clusters and local density enhancements is apparent , as is the tendency for later types to be associated with lower - density regions",
    ". a quantitative study of the clustering of different spectral types will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "+   +     +   +    the large 2dfgrs sample also allows the generalisation of the luminosity function into the bivariate brightness distribution ( bbd ) over both luminosity and surface brightness ( cross  2001 ) .",
    "the bbd derived from the 2dfgrs shows a strong surface brightness ",
    "luminosity relation , @xmath88 .",
    "the luminosity density is dominated by normal giant galaxies and the peak of the bbd lies away from the survey selection boundaries , implying that the 2dfgrs is complete and that luminous low surface brightness galaxies are rare . by integrating over the bbd",
    ", the local luminosity density is estimated to be @xmath89 .",
    "cole  ( 2001 ) have combined the 2dfgrs with the 2mass extended source catalogue to produce an infrared - selected sample of over 17000 galaxies with redshifts .",
    "this sample has been used to determine the @xmath90 and @xmath91-band galaxy luminosity functions .",
    "the luminosity functions ( in 2mass kron magnitudes ) are fairly well fit by schechter functions : in @xmath90 with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and in @xmath91 by @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 . from the distributions of @xmath14@xmath21@xmath98 and @xmath90@xmath21@xmath98 colours with absolute magnitude and models of the stellar populations",
    ", the galaxy stellar - mass function can be estimated .",
    "integrated over all galaxy masses , it yields a total mass fraction in stars ( in units of the critical density ) of @xmath99 for a kennicutt imf , and @xmath100 for a salpeter imf .",
    "these values are consistent with estimates based on the time integral of the observed star formation history of the universe only if dust extinction corrections at high redshift are modest",
    ".    the 2dfgrs can add significant value to all - sky imaging surveys at all wavelengths , as in the studies of the radio galaxy population combining redshifts and optical spectra from the 2dfgrs with the nvss radio survey ( sadler  2001 ) and the first radio survey ( magliocchetti 2001 ) .",
    "using 20% of the full 2dfgrs area , sadler  ( 2001 ) find 757 optical counterparts for nvss sources  the largest and most homogeneous set of radio - source spectra to date .",
    "these sources range from @xmath29=0.005 to @xmath29=0.438 , and are a mixture of active galaxies ( 60% ) and star - forming galaxies ( 40% ) .",

    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies .",
    "the survey uses the 2df multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope , which is capable of observing up to 400 objects simultaneously over a 2  diameter field of view .",
    "the source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the apm galaxy catalogue , which is based on automated plate measuring machine ( apm ) scans of 390 plates from the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) southern sky survey .",
    "the target galaxies have extinction - corrected magnitudes brighter than = 19.45 , with extinctions derived from the maps of schlegel  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the main survey regions are two contiguous declination strips , one in the southern galactic hemisphere ( the sgp strip ) covering 80@xmath0@xmath115@xmath0 centred close to the sgp , and the other in the northern galactic hemisphere ( the ngp strip ) covering 75@xmath0@xmath110@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , there are 99 random fields are spread uniformly over the entire region of the apm catalogue in the southern galactic hemisphere outside the sgp strip . in total",
    "the survey covers some 2000deg@xmath2 and has a median depth of @xmath3=0.11 . out to the effective limit of the survey at @xmath29@xmath300.3 , the strips contain a volume of 1.2@xmath110@xmath31 ; the volume sparsely sampled including the random fields is two to three times larger .",
    "an adaptive tiling algorithm is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93% over the whole survey region .",

    "all redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter q in the range 15 . from repeat measurements and comparisons with other redshift catalogues",
    ", we find that redshifts with q=3 have a blunder rate ( fraction of incorrect identifications ) of just under 10% and q=4 and  5 redshifts have blunder rates less than 1%the overall blunder rate for reliable ( q@xmath53 ) redshifts is 3% .",
    "the overall rms uncertainty in the q@xmath53 redshifts is 85 .",
    "the completeness of the survey is computed as a function of both field and apparent magnitude .",
    "the overall redshift completeness is 91.8% , but this varies with magnitude from 99% for the brightest galaxies to 90% for objects at the survey limit .",
    "the survey database has two components : a collection of fits files , one per object , which contain all the parameters and spectra for each object , and a msql parameter database which can be used for sophisticated searching , matching and sorting of the survey data .",
