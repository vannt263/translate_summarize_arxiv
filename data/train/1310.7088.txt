    "as far as we are aware , such methods have only been applied to curves of genus @xmath5 and @xmath24 , and our computations for the three curves in pushes these methods to their limit . in sections  [ sec : b5b7 ] ,  [ sec : b3s5 ] ,  [ sec : s3s5 ] we determine the quadratic points on the three modular curves in , and deduce modularity of the non - cuspidal real quadratic points .",
    "the four modular curves in are extremely complicated on account of their large genera , and certainly beyond the aforementioned explicit methods found in the literature .",
    "instead we give a representation of these curves as normalizations of fibre products of curves ( section  [ sec : models ] ) , and develop an analogue of the mordell  weil sieve that applies to such fibre products ( section  [ sec : sieve ] ) .",
    "remarkably , we are able to show ( section  [ sec : b3b5d7 ] ) with the help of this sieve , that the non - cuspidal real quadratic points on these curves have @xmath52-invariants belonging to @xmath0 , and so their modularity follows from the modularity of elliptic curves over @xmath0",

    ", we verified that there are no quadratic points on @xmath826 and @xmath827 above @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .    *",
    "( iii ) * although we do not need this for the proof of lemma  [ lem : b3b5d7 ] , it is interesting to ask if it can be shown that all quadratic points @xmath126 on @xmath876 , @xmath877 , @xmath878 do satisfy @xmath879 .",
    "we explain how to solve this problem by reducing it to the determination of _ rational _ points on some modular curves with milder  level structure",
    ". indeed , let @xmath126 be a non - cuspidal quadratic point on @xmath301 , where @xmath301 is one of these three modular curves @xmath745 , @xmath746 , @xmath880 .",
    "we know by the proof of lemma  [ lem : b3b5d7 ] that @xmath628 .",
    "thus the point @xmath126 is supported by some elliptic curve @xmath3 defined over @xmath0 , even though the level structure is defined over some quadratic field @xmath1 .",
    "we know in particular that @xmath881 is contained in a borel subgroup @xmath882 of @xmath406 .",
    "now @xmath881 is a subgroup of @xmath883 of index @xmath421 or @xmath5 . by a straightforward analysis of the subgroups of @xmath406 it follows that @xmath883 is contained either in @xmath882 or @xmath884 ( the normalizer of a split cartan subgroup ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath885 , we have @xmath886 is contained either in @xmath887 or @xmath888 and for @xmath889 , @xmath890 it is contained in @xmath891 . finally , for @xmath885 , @xmath746 , the image @xmath892 is contained in @xmath893 and for @xmath890 it is contained in @xmath894 .",
    "it is now not difficult to show in all cases , with the help of the results of this paper and of @xcite , that @xmath895 .",
    "consider @xmath885 for example .",
    "then @xmath3 gives rise to a @xmath0-point of one of the curves @xmath718 , @xmath472 , @xmath719 or @xmath471 .",
    "we have already determined the @xmath0-points on these four curves in the proofs of lemmas  [ lem : b3s5 ] ,  [ lem : s3s5 ] , and in lemmas  [ lem : b3b5 ] ,  [ lem : s3b5 ] .",
    "enumerating the @xmath52-invariants of these points @xmath225 , we are able to show for @xmath896 , @xmath116 that they do not pull back to non - cuspidal quadratic points on @xmath434 .",
    "to complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : modquadratic ] we merely have to prove lemma  [ lem : qsqrt5 ] , which states that every elliptic curve over @xmath446 is modular .",
    "again we reduce this problem to showing that the @xmath1-points on certain modular curves are in fact modular ( in the sense that they correspond to modular elliptic curves ) .",
    "we give fewer details in this section as compared to previous sections .",
    "this is because the task is much simpler : determining the points on a curve over one quadratic field is usually easier than determining the points over all real quadratic fields .",
    "let @xmath446 , and let @xmath3 be an elliptic curve over @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to show that @xmath3 is modular . by theorems  [ thm:35 ] and  [ thm:7 ] ,",
    "if @xmath30 is absolutely irreducible with @xmath22 or @xmath35 then @xmath3 is modular .",
    "thus we may restrict our attention to elliptic curves @xmath3 such that @xmath30 is simultaneously absolutely reducible for @xmath22 and @xmath35 . now appealing to corollary  [ cor : large2 ]",
    "we see that @xmath3 gives rise to a @xmath1-point on one of the following four modular curves @xmath897 we determined models for the first two curves in lemma  [ lem : de7 ] and found that they are isomorphic ( over @xmath0 ) to elliptic curves 49a3 and 49a4 respectively .",
    "the third curve is isomorphic ( over @xmath0 ) to the elliptic curve 21a1 .",
    "let @xmath301 be any of the first three curves . by considering both @xmath301 and its @xmath898-twist",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath899 in all cases .",
    "it follows that the @xmath1-points on the first three curves are modular .",
    "finally let @xmath900 .",
    "this curve has the obvious quotient @xmath901 .",
    "the curve @xmath377 has genus @xmath421 and is in fact isomorphic to the elliptic curve 21a1 . by the above , @xmath902 .",
    "thus if @xmath126 is a non - cuspidal @xmath1-point on @xmath301 then its image on @xmath377 belongs to @xmath903 .",
    "let @xmath338 be the non - trivial automorphism of @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath126 and @xmath482 map to the same point on @xmath377 .",
    "hence @xmath904 or @xmath905 . in the former case",
    "@xmath126 is a rational point and hence modular . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath126 corresponds to a @xmath0-curve , and is therefore modular .",
    "most of the theory we have developed in parts 2 , 3 and 4 applies to elliptic curves over arbitrary totally real fields .",
    "if one is interested in modularity of elliptic curves over a particular totally real field @xmath1 then it might be possible to prove this by the methods of this paper , together with explicit methods for computing rational points on curves ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , one can considerably simplify this task by imposing suitable restrictions on the field @xmath1 and elliptic curve @xmath3 .",
    "[ thm : unram ] let @xmath68 or @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a totally real field having some unramified place @xmath56 above @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath3 be an elliptic curve semistable at @xmath56 and suppose @xmath15 is irreducible",
    ". then @xmath3 is modular .    as @xmath906 is unramified , we have @xmath423 .",
    "let @xmath907 be the inertia subgroup of @xmath8 at @xmath56 . by ( * ?",
    "* propositions 11 , 12 , 13 ) , the image of @xmath908 in @xmath194 contains a cyclic subgroup of order @xmath909 or @xmath910 .",
    "it follows from proposition  [ prop : large2 ] that @xmath29 is absolutely irreducible .",
    "thus @xmath3 is modular by theorems  [ thm:35 ] and  [ thm:7 ] .    in @xcite ,",
    "the first - named author proves a version of theorem  [ thm : unram ] with @xmath22 ( and without the irreducibility assumption ) using modularity lifting theorems due to skinner and wiles @xcite , @xcite .",
    "wiles proof of fermat s last theorem provides a template for attacking many other diophantine equations via frey curves and modularity ( see @xcite , @xcite for recent surveys ) .",
    "modularity results over totally real fields extend the applicability of this template , as for example in @xcite .",
    "we expect the results and methods of the current paper to play an important rle in the development of this area . indeed , a forthcoming paper @xcite uses theorem  [ thm : modquadratic ] to study the fermat equation over real quadratic fields .",
    "in particular , it is shown that if @xmath911 is a squarefree integer satisfying @xmath912 or @xmath913 , @xmath914 , then there is an effectively computable constant @xmath915 such that for all primes @xmath916 , every solution to the fermat equation @xmath917 satisfies @xmath918 ."
