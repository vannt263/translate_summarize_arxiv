    "a key issue for a proper description of nuclear burning processes in the sun is an accurate treatment of chain reaction kinetics in the solar core plasma .",
    "the major nuclear inputs in kinetics simulations are rate parameters ( reactivities ) for reactions forming the @xmath2 chain and carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ( cno ) cycle in the sun .",
    "it is known that standard solar models ( ssms ) rely on a nuclear reaction network operating with thermal reactivities for particles having maxwellian velocity distribution functions . at the same time , a question whether non - maxwellian distortions of particle distributions may appear and affect reaction rates in the solar core has still been poorly studied .",
    "clayton et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed how some non - maxwellian distortions can alter the generation of solar neutrinos . in the context of the @xmath12b neutrino problem ,",
    "the authors introduced a radical _ ad hoc _ assumption that ion distributions have depleted high - energy tails and thus depart from a maxwellian function .",
    "this model _ decreases _ the contribution to reaction rates of fast particles with energies large compared to the thermal energy . although the model was shown to provide a pathway toward a solution of the neutrino problem , later bahcall argued @xcite that the degree of depletion needed is unlikely to occur in the dense core .    in the meantime ,",
    "other non - maxwellian phenomena which _ increase _ the contribution of fast particles can manifest in the solar core plasma .",
    "these are suprathermal processes triggered by fast nucleons and lightest nuclei naturally appearing in the plasma .",
    "these particles are predominantly generated in exoergic reactions of the @xmath2 chain and usually have mev energies . when slowing down in the plasma they can undergo in - flight nuclear reactions and thus contribute to total reaction rates .",
    "the level of this suprathermal effect depends on a particular reaction .",
    "for exoergic processes , candidates most appropriate for the effect to manifest are reactions with pronounced resonances at suprathermal energies . in turn , direct reactions with cross sections moderately depending on energy are less sensitive to fast particles . as for endoergic processes ,",
    "most of them can be appreciably influenced by fast particles having energies in excess of reaction threshold @xmath13 .",
    "one may expect therefore that energetic particles provide different impacts on forward ( exoergic ) @xmath14 and reverse ( endoergic ) @xmath15 reactions .",
    "this can lead to a deviation of the relation between forward and reverse reactivities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , from a standard law for maxwellian plasma @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rev - for ] ) , the quantity @xmath19 is the q - value of the forward reaction , @xmath20 is the plasma temperature in units of energy , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are algebraic combinations of particle mass numbers @xmath23 and temperature - dependent partition functions @xmath24 , respectively ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the violation of this relation caused by non - maxwellian particles in astrophysical plasmas was recently obtained for several main processes of big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and for some reactions of the solar cno cycle @xcite . in particular , it was shown that 8.674-mev @xmath0 particles produced in the @xmath25 reaction of the @xmath2 chain in the sun crucially affect the balance of @xmath26 reactions , so that the reverse @xmath27 process can even block the forward @xmath28 one , distorting running of the cno cycle .",
    "this particular finding suggests the role of fast reaction - produced ions in the solar core may be unappreciated in ssms , and in a greater or lesser degree it may concern processes of the @xmath2 chain and cno cycle .",
    "furthermore , if we find that suprathermal reactions are capable of altering some element abundances in the core , suprathermal corrections to the fluxes of some solar neutrinos may also be obtained . in this context",
    ", it is worthwhile to note that the cno cycle subdominant for energy generation in the sun is an important source of neutrinos released in the @xmath29-decay of @xmath30n , @xmath31o , and also @xmath7f nuclei .",
    "the cno neutrinos carry valuable information on solar core metallicity @xcite , and may also provide an independent test on the core temperature determined earlier on the basis of sudbury neutrino observatory and super - kamiokande experiments .",
    "all this serves as a clear argument in favor of a further study of non - maxwellian ( suprathermal ) reactions in the solar interior . in this paper , a consistent model to properly describe these processes",
    "is formulated .",
    "the model is based on a formalism of in - flight reaction probability , operates with different approaches for the treatment of fast particle slowing - down in a matter , and takes into account some plasma peculiarities , such as the effect of electron degeneracy on in - flight reaction rates and electron screening of thermal reactions in the core . on",

    "the most effective energy for this reaction , i.e , the gamow peak energy is @xmath225 @xcite , so in the solar core region @xmath226 varies within 1422  kev . for such deep subbarrier energies reliable data on the @xmath227 @xmath0-particle spectrum",
    "are not available in the literature that greatly complicates an analysis of the @xmath0-particle contribution to the @xmath3 rate .",

    "figures [ fig : rev - prob ] and [ fig : rates ] demonstrate that the non - maxwellian nuclear effects predicted on the basis of a simplified model @xcite can really occur in the solar core .",
    "one can schematically divide the core into three regions . in the inner core at @xmath229",
    "the reverse @xmath3 reaction is weaker than the forward @xmath8 one and does not perturb the cno running . in the narrow shell at @xmath230 these two reactions",

    "[ fig:17o ] .",
    "it is seen that the suprathermal @xmath3 reaction is capable of essentially enhancing the @xmath7o abundance in the outer core .",
    "the exact degree of this enhancement however may differ from that displayed in fig .",

    "it is based on the formalism of in - flight reaction probability , operates with different methods for the treatment of particle slowing - down in the matter , and takes into account some peculiarities typical of nuclear processes in dense plasmas .",
    "these are the influence of electron degeneracy both on charged particle energy loss and suprathermal reaction rates , and electron screening of thermal processes in the solar core plasma .",
    "our model extends the previous approach to study suprathermal solar reactions discussed in @xcite and refines its predictions .    to explore capabilities of this model",
    ", it has been applied to calculate the main characteristics of non - maxwellian 8.674-mev @xmath0 particles generated in the @xmath1 reaction of the @xmath2 chain , and to examine suprathermal processes in the solar cno cycle induced by them .",

    "the effect of electron degeneracy and electron screening on its rate in the solar core has been clarified .",
    "it has been shown that they increase the suprathermal @xmath11 rate by @xmath241% at @xmath4 .",
    "the point of particular importance is that at @xmath242 this rate appreciably exceeds the rates of two conventional reactions ",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the first one closes the cno - ii cycle and both of them burn up @xmath7o in the core .",
    "this distorts running of the cno cycle so that normal branching @xmath5 of nuclear flow ( closing the branch ii and starting the branch iii ) transforms to abnormal sequential flow @xmath6 .",
    "the region of this distortion covers @xmath233% of the solar core volume . as a result",
    ", the @xmath3 reaction causes an enhancement of the @xmath7o abundance in the core as compared with standard estimates . for the steady state case ,",
    "the enhancement factor in the outer core reaches @xmath10 .",
    "rough estimates also suggest that an additional effect here may come from fast @xmath0 particles produced in the @xmath243 reaction of the @xmath2 chain .",
    "furthermore , we expect that suprathermal @xmath11 reactions other than @xmath3 may also alter abundances of cno elements , including those generating solar neutrinos .",
    "this issue however is addressed to a future publication .    in closing , the applicability of the model presented is not restricted to solar studies and it can be used for an analysis of non - maxwellian processes in some other stars , if main sources of energetic particles are accurately identified ."
