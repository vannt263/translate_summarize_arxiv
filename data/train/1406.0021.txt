    "turbulent transport in flows with chemical reactions is of great interest in various applications , ranging from combustion to physics of turbulent atmosphere of the earth ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . during the decades turbulent transport of passive scalar and particles",
    "has been subject of an active research ( see , e.g. , handbooks @xcite and reviews @xcite ) . many important problems , including particle clustering in isothermal @xcite and stratified @xcite turbulence , intermittency @xcite , effective diffusion @xcite , the formation of large - scale inhomogeneous structures in spatial distribution of particles or different scalar fields in small - scale turbulence @xcite have been investigated in analytical , numerical and laboratory studies .",
    "however , impact of chemical reactions on turbulent transport have been studied mainly numerically and in the context of turbulent combustion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "combustion process is the chemical reaction accompanied by heat release .",
    "turbulent combustion can proceed as volume distributed chemical reaction ( e.g. , as a homogeneous burning of the turbulent premixed gaseous mixture ) or propagate as a flame front in a turbulent flow separating fresh unburned fuel and combustion products ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in both cases turbulence",
    "is created by an external forcing and can be enhanced by intrinsic instability of the flame front ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "notice that temperature and equilibrium composition of combustion products are purely thermodynamic characteristics determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium laws which yield a relation between the initial and final stages . in this case",
    "chemical kinetics described by a one - step arrhenius model provides results which usually are in a good agreement with experimental data . on the contrary , in order to reproduce transient processes that are accompanied by compression and shock waves , it is necessary to take into account the detailed chemical reaction mechanisms involving several hundreds chemical reactions .",
    "this complex chemistry determines the chemical time scales , such as induction time and period of exothermal reaction , competing with transport time scales in formation of the zone of energy release .",
    "the latter determines the evolution of the propagating flame ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in a turbulent atmosphere",
    "the most common are the volume distributed chemical reactions , while during wild fires propagation of the turbulent flame front is of particular interest in the atmospheric and industrial applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the previous studies the main attention was focused on evaluation of nonlinear sources in the governing equations for concentrations of chemical species . in such description",
    "the effect of chemical reactions on turbulent transport coefficients has been neglected .",
    "for the first time the effect of chemistry on turbulent diffusion was studied in @xcite by means of a path - integral approach for the kraichnan - kazantsev model ( see @xcite ) of the random velocity field , and it was found that turbulent diffusion can be strongly depleted by chemical reactions or phase transitions .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that there exists an additional non - diffusive turbulent flux of number density of gaseous admixture ( proportional to the mean temperature gradient multiplied by the number density of gaseous admixture ) and additional turbulent heat flux ( proportional to the gradient of the mean number density of gaseous admixture ) in flows with chemical reactions or phase transitions .",
    "the effect of chemistry on turbulent diffusion has been recently studied in @xcite using mean - field simulations ( mfs ) and direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . in these simulations a reactive front propagation in a turbulent flow was investigated using the kolmogorov - petrovskii- piskunov ( kpp ) equation @xcite or the fisher equation @xcite .",
    "this equation has also been amended by an advection term to describe the interaction with a turbulent velocity field @xcite . in mfs of @xcite memory effects of turbulent diffusion",
    "have been taken into account to determine the front speed in the case when the turbulent time , @xmath0 , is much larger than the characteristic chemical time , @xmath1 .",
    "it was found that the memory effects saturate the front speed to values of the turbulent speed , while the nonlinearity of the reaction term increases the front speed .",
    "this study allows to determine the dependence of the turbulent diffusion coefficient versus the turbulent damkhler number , @xmath2 .    in the present study we investigate turbulent transport of chemically reacting gaseous admixtures in a developed turbulence using a spectral tau approach ( high - order closure procedure ) ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated here the existence of the turbulent cross - effects , including turbulent mutual diffusion of gaseous admixtures and turbulent dufour - effect .",
    "the mechanisms of these cross - effects are different from the molecular cross effects known in irreversible thermodynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in a developed turbulence and at large peclet numbers",
    "the turbulent cross - effects are much larger than the molecular ones .",
    "these results are also valid for heterogeneous phase transitions .",
    "we show that for a large turbulent damkhler number @xmath3 turbulent diffusion of the admixtures can be strongly reduced by a large factor @xmath4 depending on the value of stoichiometric coefficients of chemical species . in this paper",
    "we illustrate effect of chemistry on turbulent diffusion using simple global one step chemical reactions taking into account the reaction order .",
    "such approach provides qualitatively and often quantitatively correct physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the governing equations and applied methods are formulated in section ii .",
    "turbulent fluxes of chemically reacting admixtures are determined in sections iii and iv .",
