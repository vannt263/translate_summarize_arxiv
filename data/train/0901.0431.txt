    "the hyperaccreting disk surrounding a stellar - mass black hole possibly formed by the merger of a compact object binary or the collapse of a massive star has been argued to be a candidate for central engines of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. eichler et al .",

    "2000 ; wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ) . in recent years , newborn neutron stars have also been suggested as an origin of some grbs and their afterglows .",
    "for example , dai et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued that the x - ray flares discovered by _",
    "swift _ can be explained as being due to magnetic instability and reconnection - driven events from highly - magnetized millisecond pulsars ; the shallow decay phase of x - ray afterglows is considered to be due to energy injection to a forward shock by a relativistic pulsar wind ( dai 2004 ; yu & dai 2007 ) ; a newly - formed neutron star rather than a black hole is expected to explain the light curve of sn 2006aj associated with grb 060218 ( mazzali et al .",

    "moreover , simulations on the merger of a compact object binary show that it is possible to form a hypermassive neutron star , at least a transiently existing neutron star after the merger , depending on initial conditions of the binary , equations of state of neutron matter and the structure of magnetic fields ( shibata et al .",

    "therefore , the hyperaccreting disk around a neutron star can also be considered as possible central engines for some grbs .",
    "based on these motivations , we have studied the structure of the hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star using both analytic and numerical methods ( zhang & dai 2008 , hereafter zd08 ) .",
    "we found that the neutron - star disk can cool more efficiently and produce a higher neutrino luminosity than the black - hole disk .    in zd08 , the quasi - steady disk around a neutron star",
    "is approximately divided into two regions  inner and outer disks , depending on the energy transfer and emission in the disk . for the outer disk",
    ", the heating energy rate @xmath6 is mainly due to local dissipation ( @xmath7 ) , and the structure of the outer disk is very similar to the black - hole disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the heating energy in the inner disk includes both the energy generated by itself and the energy advected from the outer region ( @xmath8 ) , so the inner disk has to be dense with a high pressure .",
    "we approximately take @xmath9 and the entropy - conservation self - similar condition @xmath10=0 to describe the inner disk .",
    "the size of the inner disk is determined by the global energy equation of the inner disk . however , we need to point out that the entropy - conversation structure is not the only possible structure of the inner disk , which depends on the detailed form of energy and mass transfer . in the case",
    "where @xmath11 in the inner disk , we should take the advection - dominated self - similar structure to describe the inner disk .",
    "the net gravitational binding energy of the accreting matter is proposed to drive a relativistic outflow or jet by two general mechanisms that could provide energy for grbs : neutrino annihilation and magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms such as the blandford - znajek effect .",
    "the mechanism of neutrino annihilation is easy to understand and could be calculated based on the structure and neutrino luminosity in the disk ( ruffert et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; popham et al . 1999 ; asano & fukuyama 2000 , 2001 ; di matteo et al . 2002 ; miller et al .",

    "2007 ; gu et al . 2006 ; liu et al .",
    ". however , the annihilation rate due to neutrino emission from the black - hole disk may not be able to produce a sufficiently high luminosity to explain some energetic grbs ( di matteo et al . 2002 ) .",
    "gu et al . ( 2006 ) and liu et al . ( 2007 ) showed that the annihilation luminosity can reach @xmath12ergs s@xmath13 even for an accretion rate @xmath14 s@xmath13 .",
    "however , such an accretion rate is too large for energetic long grbs , since this requires an unreasonable massive accretion disk around a compact object .",
    "as the neutron - star disk structure and neutrino luminosity are different from the black - hole disk , it is interesting to calculate the neutrino annihilation rate above the neutron - star disk and to consider whether the annihilation energy rate and luminosity above a neutron - star disk are high enough to produce energetic grbs .",
    "on the other hand , we do not consider any outflow from the disk and neutron star in zd08 , which may play a significant role in the structure and energy transfer in the disks around neutron stars .",
    "a nonrelativistic or mildly relativistic ouflow or  wind \" from the disk can be considered as an energy source of supernovae ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; kohri et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this theoretical model becomes more attractive after the discovery of the connection between some grbs and supernovae ( e.g. galama et al .",
    "1998 , stanek et al .",
    "2003 , prochaska et al . 2004 , campana et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the grb component is considered from a relativistic jet produced by neutrino annihilation . as a result",
    ", both outflow ejection and neutrino annihilation could be important in the events of grb - sn connections within the framework of the collaspar model ( woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "however , an outflow from the black - hole disk is expected and becomes important whenever the accretion flow is an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) , while the neutrino luminosity is relatively low for adaf .",
    "in other words , neutrino emission may not provide a sufficiently high amount of energy for grbs associated with supernovae if a thermally - driven outflow is produced from the advection - dominated disk at the same time .",
    "therefore , we need to calculate the neutrino luminosity and annihilation efficiency of the advection - dominated disk with outflow around a neutron star if the neutrino luminosity is much higher for the advection - dominated neutron - star disk than the black - hole disk .    in this paper we still consider the case in which the central object is a neutron star rather than a black hole .",
    "our purpose is to further study the structure of a hyperaccreting neutron - star disk following zd08 , and calculate the neutrino annihilation rate above such a disk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce basic equations of the neutrino - cooled disk .",
    "we discuss the properties of the inner disk in  3 based on the two - region disk scenario introduced in zd08 .",
    "we study the disk with different values of the viscosity parameter @xmath0 and the energy parameter @xmath1 ( some quantities are given in this paper in table 1 ) , and then study the disk structure with an outflow .",
    "two models of an outflow driven from the neutron - star disk are introduced in  3.4 . in  4 , we calculate the neutrino annihilation rate and luminosity above the neutron - star disk in various cases , and compare the results with the black hole disk .",
    "we discuss the effect of the neutrino luminosity at the neutron star surface boundary layer on the annihilation rate . in  5 , we particularly focus on an astrophysical application of the neutron - star disk in grbs and grb - sn connections .",
    "conclusions are presented in  6 .",

    "the ratio of the neutrino pressure to the total pressure becomes noticeable only in very opaque regions of the disk ( e.g. , kohri et al .",

    "however , we should keep in mind that the @xmath69-equilibrium is established only if the neutronization timescale @xmath91 is much shorter than the accretion timescale @xmath92 in the disk @xmath93 .",
    "beloborodov ( 2003 ) found that the equilibrium requires the accretion rate @xmath29 to satisfy @xmath94 when the accretion rate is sufficiently low , the electron fraction @xmath46 would freeze out from weak equilibrium , while the disk becomes advection - dominated ( e.g. , metzger et al . 2008b , 2009 ) .",
    "in this case , the chemical composition of the disk is determined by its initial condition before its evolution .",
    "metzger et al . ( 2009 ) , for example , showed that the hyperaccreting disk around a black hole generically freeze out with the fixed @xmath95 .",
    "we will discuss the effect of chemical equilibrium on neutron - star disks more detailedly in the next section .",
    "the @xmath69-equilibrium assumption can be approximately adopted in our calculations even for the adaf case .",
    "the two - region disk scenario in zd08 allows the gravitational energy of the neutron - star disk system to be released in three regions : outer disk , inner disk and neutron - star surface .",
    "the inner disk region is formed due to the prevention effect of the neutron - star surface , i.e. , most advection energy generated in the disk still need to be released in a region near the neutron - star surface . moreover , a difference between the angular velocity of the neutron - star surface and that of the disk inner boundary layer leads to neutrino emission in the surface boundary layer . in zd08 , we assume all the advected energy to be released in the disk and furthermore all the advected energy from the outer region to be released in the inner disk . actually , it is possible that a part of the advected energy can be transferred onto the neutron - star surface and finally cooled by neutrino emission from the surface boundary layer rather than the inner disk .",
    "local microphysics quantities such as the inner energy density , neutrino cooling rate , heating convection and conduction properties as well as the advection and cooling timescales should be calculated in order to simulate the inner disk formation and the cooling efficiency of the steady - state inner disk . in this paper , however , we adopt a simple method to determine the inner disk structure , i.e. , we use the global energy equation ( [ a09 ] ) with the global parameter @xmath1 instead of the local energy equation ( [ a05 ] ) .",
    "the inner disk can release all the advected energy transferred inward for @xmath68 , while a part of the advected energy can still be transferred onto the neutron - star surface for @xmath3 .",

    "the inner disk model can be simplified and calculated by assuming the accretion rate , the mass of the central compact object , and the self - similar structure of the inner disk .",
    "we discussed the disk structure with the entropy - conservation condition in zd08 , and in this section we further discuss the properties of the neutron - star disk in various cases .",
    "furthermore , we need to consider the effect of an outflow from the neutron - star disk .",

    "the disk with a moderate viscosity parameter ( @xmath0=0.01 ) has the highest annihilation efficiency and luminosity for a low accretion rate , and the annihilation luminosity from a high-@xmath0 disk ( @xmath0=0.1 ) becomes the brightest for an accretion rate @xmath221 s@xmath13 . as discussed in figure 2 , a low-@xmath0 disk has a brighter neutrino luminosity @xmath222 , but it is thinner than a high-@xmath0 disk .",
    "these two competitive factors lead to the annihilation results shown in figure 7a .",
    "figure 7b shows that the annihilation efficiency increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this is because the disk with lower @xmath1 means more heating energy in the disk to be advected onto the neutron star surface and increases the neutrino luminosity of the surface layer , and the value of @xmath207 , which plays an important role in increasing the annihilation efficiency of the entire disk .",
    "figure 8 shows the total neutrino annihilation luminosity @xmath210 of the disk with an outflow .",
    "we consider the results of model o1 in which an outflow only exists in the inner disk due to the neutron star surface and of model o2 in which an outflow exists in the entire disk .",
    "the difference in annihilation luminosity with different values of the outflow index @xmath40 but the same surface boundary condition is not obvious in model o1 .",
    "however , @xmath210 becomes much dimmer for a high outflow index @xmath40 in model o2 , which means a strong outflow in the entire disk and decreases the neutrino annihilation efficiency significantly .",
    "furthermore , we study the spatial distribution of the neutrino annihilation luminosity .",
    "figure 9 illustrates the integrated annihilation luminosity per cm distribution @xmath223 for two accretion rates @xmath29=0.01@xmath216 s@xmath13 and 0.1@xmath216 s@xmath13 with different physical structures of the disk .",
    "we find that the integrated annihilation luminosity drops dramatically along the disk radius , and a majority of the annihilation energy is ejected from the cylindric region above the disk with @xmath224 cm .",
    "the difference of the integrated luminosity per cm between the black - hole disk and neutron - star disk is significant for a low accretion rate when the inner entropy - conservation disk is sufficiently large .",
    "the luminosity of the neutron - star disk with an advecting inner disk can be about four orders of magnitude higher than its black - hole counterpart , while an outflow makes the annihilation luminosity above the neutron - star disk be lower than that of the black - hole disk .    compared with the black - hole disk , the neutron - star disk could produce a brighter neutrino flux and more powerful annihilation luminosity . however , the mass - loss rate driven by neutrino - on - baryon absorption reactions ( qian & woosley 1996 ) along the polar axis of the neutron - star disk is also significantly higher than its black - hole counterpart .",
    "this raises the problem of whether simultaneously more powerful annihilation luminosity and higher mass loss rate could work together to produce a relativistic jet required for the grb phenomena .",
    "for example , a heavily baryon - loaded wind from a new - born neutron star within 100 ms prevents any production of a relativistic jet ( dessart et al .",
    "however , a weaker wind above the polar region and spherical asymmetry of the outflow at late times could make production of a relativistic jet above the stellar pole become possible . we will discuss this issue in more details in  5.3 .",
    "in  3 we study various self - similar structures of the inner disk . in this section",
    "we further discuss the entropy - conservation structure .",
    "the inner disk can be determined by the self - similar structure ( [ c02 ] ) and the energy equation ( [ a09 ] ) .",
    "however , the inner disk with the entropy - conservation structure can not satisfy the integrated angular momentum equation ( [ a04 ] ) .",
    "there are two explanations .",
    "first , we can consider the term @xmath225 in equation ( [ a03 ] ) for a steady - state disk since the angular momentum redistributes in the inner disk before the entire disk becomes steady - state . as mentioned in zd08 , because the neutron star surface prevents heating energy from being further advected inward , the inner disk forms to balance the heating and cooling energy in the entire disk .",
    "as a result , energy and angular momentum could redistribute in the inner disk .",
    "second , besides this consideration on angular momentum redistribution , we can also discuss another type of inner disk with the entropy - conservation structure discussed by medvedev & narayan ( 2000 ) , which still satisfies the angular momentum equation ( [ a04 ] ) with @xmath107 and @xmath226constant .",
    "the angular momentum transfer and heating energy generation due to viscosity can be neglected in the inner disk , as @xmath18 is approximately equal to a constant , and the heating energy in the inner disk is merely the energy advected from the outer disk , i.e. , @xmath227 in the inner disk . as a result , the global inner - disk energy conservation equation ( [ a09 ] ) should be modified as @xmath228}\\right\\},\\label{h01}\\ ] ] for @xmath229 in the inner disk . compared with equation ( [ a09 ] ) ,",
    "equation ( [ h01 ] ) requires a smaller value of @xmath60 with the same neutron star mass and accretion rate .",
    "figure 10 shows the value of @xmath60 for @xmath0=0.1 and 0.01 with @xmath230constant and @xmath231 . the constant angular velocity in the inner disk decreases the inner disk size compared to the case of @xmath231 .",
    "however , in order to get a unified scenario of the entire disk in various cases , we adopt @xmath231 for all the self - similar structures in  3 .",
    "several previous studies have been performed to calculate the neutrino annihilation efficiency above the disk around a black hole with the effects of disk geometry , gravitational bending , rotation of central black holes and so on ( e.g. , ruffert et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; popham et al . 1999 ; asano & fukuyama 2000 , 2001 ; miller et al . 2003 ; birkl et al .",
    "the simulations based on general relativity show the effects of general relativity such as the kerr black holes and bending neutrino geodesics in spacetime increase the total annihilation rate by a factor of a few .",
    "also , compared with the spherical and torus neutrinosphere , the disk neutrinosphere with the same temperature and neutrino luminosity distribution usually have the highest annihilation efficiency ( birkl et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this paper",
    ", we still adopt the calculation approach on annihilation based on ruffert et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) and popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and consider the vertically - integrated newtonian disk .",
    "the most important results of annihilation calculation in our work is that the neutron - star disk produce more energetic annihilation luminosity compared to the black - hole counterpart .",
    "moreover , we consider neutrinos emitted from the stellar surface region , and the neutrino emission concentrated in this surface region plays a significant role in increasing the annihilation luminosity to produce relativistic ejecta formed by @xmath70 plasma . on the other hand",
    ", we should note that the effect of surface boundary condition emission could be reduced if the emission region becomes larger than we consider in this paper due to outflow or the other cooling mechanisms rather than neutrino cooling at the surface . some other works focusing on neutrino annihilation in supernovae discussed neutrino emission from the entire spherical neutron star surface ( cooperstein et al .",
    "1986 ; goodman et al . 1987 ; salmonson & wilson 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , a further work should be done to study the effects of boundary emission and cooling based on more elaborate considerations on cooling mechanisms and energy transfer at the boundary around neutron - star disk . however , as the neutron - star disk and the surface emission increase the annihilation luminosity more significantly than the general relativity effects , we conclude our main results would maintain for more elaborate simulations based on advanced calculations on neutrino annihilation above the disk .",
    "energy can be deposited in the polar region of black - hole and neutron - star disks by neutrino annihilation and mhd processes .",
    "we focus on the annihilation process in this paper . in the black - hole case , the environment along the polar axis ( i.e. , the rotation axis of the disk around neutron star ) can be baryon - free .",
    "for example , grb can commence after the initial collapse for @xmath232 s in the collapsar scenario , when the accretion process in the polar region becomes sufficiently weak to produce a relatively clean environment with the mass density @xmath233 g @xmath234 ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . in the neutron - star case ,",
    "however , the enormous neutrino luminosity of a neutron star would drive appreciable mass - loss from its surface during the first 20 s of its life ( qian & woosley 1996 ) . the wind material will feed the polar region , where a large amount of annihilation energy is deposited .",

    "( 2009 ) showed that a newly formed neutron star from the neutron star binary merger will develop a powerful neutrino - driven wind in the polar funnel in a few milliseconds after its formation . the mass - loss associated with",
    "the neutrino - driven wind is on the order of @xmath235 s@xmath13 , preventing energy outflow from being accelerated to relativistic speed and producing a grb .",
    "their numerical simulations stops at @xmath236 ms , while they considered that the neutron star will collapse to a black hole quickly .",
    "however , a stable neutron star with much longer lifetime @xmath237 ms has also been proposed as the grb central engine . a rapidly rotating neutron star formed by the neutron star binary merger ( gao & fan 2006 ) or the merger of a white dwarf binary ( king et al . 2001 )",
    "could produce extended emission ( metzger et al .",
    "2008b ) or x - ray flares ( dai et al .",
    "2006 ) about 10 - 100 s afetr the neutron star birth , and last for tens of seconds . in the collapsar scenario , a newly formed neutron star or a magnetar could also form after the initial collapse or associated supernova explosion , and the lifetime of the neutron star before collapsing to a black hole can reach as long as several months to yrs ( vietri & stella 1998 ) . therefore , many grb models lead to a longtime ( @xmath237 ms ) neutron star , which can produce other phenomena accompanying the grb prompt emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the accretion timescale can last for longer than 10s in the collapse process of a massive star , or for several seconds after the merger of a compact star binary with the disk viscosity parameter @xmath238 ( narayan et al .",
    "thus we can discuss the steady - state scenario of a neutron star with lifetime @xmath237 ms surrounded by a hyperaccreting disk .",
    "for a longtime neutron star , the strengthen of a neutrino - driven winds above the stellar polar region would drop quickly at late times , as the total mass - loss rate @xmath239 , and the neutrino - driven wind become weaker above the polar region than that from the low latitudes and midplane region of the neutron star .",
    "it is difficult to calculate the spatial distribution of lorentz factor of the outflow material above the polar region precisely in our present work , because we only use the approximate disk geometry to calculate the steady - state spatial distribution of the neutrino annihilation efficiency .",
    "we do not simulate the dynamical evolution of the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "however , we can estimate the speed of outflow material using semi - analytic methods as follows . the mass loss rate for a thermal neutrino - driven wind can be approximately given by ( qian & woosley 1996 ) @xmath240 where @xmath241@xmath242ergs s@xmath13 is the luminosity of the @xmath243 emission , @xmath244=1mev@xmath245 is the mean neutrino energy of the neutron star surface , and @xmath246",
    ". thus the typical steady state spherical mass - loss rate due to thermal neutrino absorption reactions for a neutron star with 10 km radius is on the order of a few @xmath247 s@xmath13 , depending on the initial configuration of the material above the neutron star surface ( i.e. , qian & woosley 1996 , tab .",
    "1 ) . the mass - loss rate depends on the neutrino luminosity and temperature above the neutron star surface sensitively .",
    "when the neutron star with weak magnetic field @xmath248 g is surrounded by a hyperaccreting disk , the neutron star surface should have a higher temperature near the star midplane than its polar region , as mentioned in the last section  4 .",
    "thus the neutron star should produce a stronger wind above the midplane region than above its poles . as a result",
    ", the mass - loss rate via neutrino absorption above the star polar region is estimated as @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the solid angle of the polar funnel , and @xmath251 is used to measure the degree of spherical asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the bulk lorentz factor of the outflows from the neutron star surface is @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the fraction of deposited annihilation energy which provides kinetic energy of the neutron star wind above the polar region .",
    "we can estimate whether the outflow material from the polar region of the neutron star surface can be accelerated to a relativistic speed using equation ( [ wind04 ] ) . here",
    "we take the bulk lorentz factor @xmath254 as a mildly relativistic speed , @xmath255 as a moderately relativistic speed and @xmath256 as an ultrarelativistic speed .",
    "if we take the bulk lorentz factor @xmath257 as a parameter , the solid angle of the polar region @xmath258 , and @xmath259 , then we can estimate the upper limit of total thermal mass - loss rate from the neutron star surface with particular boundary layer conditions , and compare such limits with the actual mass - loss rate of thermal neutrino - driven winds calculated by equation ( [ wind01 ] ) . in figure 11",
    "we explore the possibility of producing a relativistic jet .",
    "we show the maximum allowed strength of total mass - loss for the wind material above the polar region being accelerated to @xmath260 and @xmath261 with the chosen boundary layer condition @xmath262 and @xmath263 as in  4 .",
    "the neutrino emission from the neutron star surface layer increases the neutrino annihilation luminosity and efficiency , while it increases the stellar surface mass - loss simultaneously . from figure 11",
    ", we find that moderately relativistic outflows above the neutron star polar region are possible under some cases , e.g. , the wind material can be accelerated to @xmath264 above the polar region for the disk accretion rate @xmath265 s@xmath13 with @xmath263 .",
    "this result can still be kept for other values of @xmath266 around unit .",
    "however , annihilation process can never produce any winds with bulk lorentz factor @xmath267 , as the heavily mass - loaded neutron - star wind precludes ultrarelativistic speed even for very high annihilation efficiency with sufficiently bright neutrino emission from the innermost disk radius .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2003 , 2004 ) found that relativistic jets formed in the accreting black hole systems can be collimated by their passage through the stellar envelope ; moderately and even mildly relativistic jets can be partly accelerated to an ultrarelativistic speed after they break out in the massive star , because the jets internal energy can be converted to kinetic energy after jet breakout .",
    "such jet - stellar - envelope interactions also happen around the hyperaccreting neutron star systems , although the neutron - star disk systems can be surrounded by a cavity @xmath268 cm inside the progenitor stars with the stellar radius of several @xmath269 cm ( e.g. , bucciantini et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) . in the compact star binary merger scenario ,",
    "on the other hand , a moderately relativistic jet is possible to produce a short - duration grb .    as a result",
    ", the neutron - star disk can produce a sufficiently larger annihilation luminosity than its black - hole counterpart .",
    "however , a neutrino - driven outflow from the newly formed neutron star at early times ( @xmath270 ms ) is so heavily mass - loaded that it can in no way be accelerated to relativistic speed . for a longtime neutron star , however , mass - loss becomes weaker above the stellar pole than above the low latitudes and midplane .",
    "thus a moderately relativistic jet can be produced in a hyperaccreting neutron - star system with sufficiently high disk accretion rate and bright boundary emission ( e.g. , the accretion rate @xmath265 s@xmath13 for @xmath263 ) .",
    "also , the jet can be collimated by jet - stellar - envelope interactions , and partly accelerated to an ultrarelativistic speed after jet breakout if the neutron star forms through stellar collapse . therefore",
    ", some hyperaccreting neutron - star system can produce grbs , which are more energetic than those from the black - hole systems . we know",
    "that some long - duration grbs can reach a peak luminosity of @xmath271 ergs s@xmath13 ( e.g. grb 990123 , kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ) , which requires a very high accretion rate @xmath272 s@xmath13 as well as a much more massive disk ( @xmath273 ) around a black hole compared to the typical disk or torus mass @xmath274 if the energy is provided by neutrino annihilation above the black - hole disk .",
    "however , if we consider the neutron - star disk with the surface boundary emission ( e.g. @xmath275 ) , we only need an accretion rate @xmath276 s@xmath13 onto the neutron star , which is one order of magnitude less than that of the black - hole disk , and the disk mass can be @xmath276 for a long burst with the peak luminosity @xmath12 ergs s@xmath13 in a time of about 1s .",
    "however , other reasons or mechanisms such as the jet effect to reduce the total burst energy or the magnetic mechanism rather than neutrino annihilation to provide the grb energy have been introduced into the grb central engine models .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to search new important observational evidence to show the existence of a central neutron star rather than black hole surrounded by a hyperaccreting disk .",
    "x - ray flares after grbs may be a piece of evidence , which shows that an activity of the central neutron star after the burst may be due to magnetic instability and reconnection effects in differentially - rotating pulsars ( dai et al .",
    "however , more studies should be done to compare other models of x - ray flares ( king et al .",
    "2005 ; proga & zhang 2006 ; perna et al . 2005 ; lee & ramires - ruiz 2007 , lazzati et al .",
    "2008 ) with the differential - rotating pulsar model and show more effects of such a magnetized pulsar .",
    "for example , the spin - down power of a magnetar probably explains the peculiar optical to x - ray integrated luminosity of grb 060218 ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , we propose that other grb - like events may be produced by hyperaccreting neutron star systems , if winds fail to reach a proper relativistic speed . as mentioned by macfadyen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , a mildly or moderately relativistic jet may lead to x - ray flashes , which are less energetic than normal grbs .",
    "this will also happen in the neutron - star case .",
    "another possible result is that a heavily mass - loaded wind with nonrelativistic speed could produce a bright sn - like optical transient event ( kohri et al . 2005 ; metzger et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "besides grba and grb - like phenomena , we think a nonrelativistic or mildly relativistic outflow from a hyperaccreting disk and neutron star surface may feed a supernova explosion associated with a grb . the discovery of connection between some grbs and supernovae has inspired studies of the origin of grb - sn association ( e.g. , iwamota et al .",
    "1998 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; zhang et al . 2004",
    "; nagataki et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; mazzali et al .",
    "as discussed in kohri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , an outflow from the hyperaccreting disk is possible to provide a successful supernova with both prompt explosion or delayed explosion .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to propose a general scenario for the origin of grb - sn connection : some hyperaccreting disks with outflows around compact objects are central engines of grbs or xrfs companied by supernovae .",
    "the thermal - driven outflow energy from the disk provides a part of or even a majority of the kinetic energy of a supernova , and neutrino annihilation from the disk provides the energy of a grb if the accretion rate is sufficiently high .",
    "now we use the results in  3.3 and  4.2 to discuss the energy of the outflow from the disk , and compare it with the neutrino annihilation luminosity and energy above the disk .",
    "the upper limit of the energy rate carried away by the outflow can be estimated by subtracting the heating energy rate generated in the disk from the ideal heating energy rate of the disk without outflow , i.e. , the maximum energy rate of the outflow is @xmath277}\\right\\ } -\\int_{r_{*}}^{r_{out}}\\frac{9}{8}\\nu\\sigma\\frac{gm}{r^{3}}2\\pi rdr,\\label{h02}\\ ] ] and the total actual outflow energy can be considered to be @xmath278 fraction of the maximum outflow energy . in table 4",
    "we list various energy rates , including the heating energy rate in the disk , the maximum energy injection rate to an outflow and the neutrino annihilation rate above the disk .",
    "we choose the accretion rate to be 0.3@xmath216 s@xmath13 in both models o1 and o2 in  3.3 . compared with model o1 , the neutron - star disk with an outflow from the entire disk ( model o2 ) produces higher outflow energy but less neutrino annihilation rate .",
    "if the disk mass around a neutron star is @xmath279 , then the maximum outflow energy is @xmath280 ergs in model o1 , and @xmath271 ergs in model o2 , but the annihilation luminosity in model o2 would be one or two orders of magnitude less than that in model o1 .",
    "besides the case of a neutron star , the black - hole disk with an outflow can provide the same order of outflow energy ejecta as in model o2 , but even dimmer annihilation luminosity than model o2 .",
    "therefore , further studies of an energy relation between grbs and supernovae in grb - sn events could distinguish between the neutron - star disk models ( model o1 and o2 ) and the black - hole disk model .      in this paper",
    ", we do not consider the effect of magnetic fields .",
    "as mentioned in zd08 , the high magnetic fields of central neutron stars or magnetars @xmath281 g could play a significant role in the global structure of the disk as well as various microphysical processes in the disk . moreover , compared to the neutron star surface , which produces @xmath70 jets and outflows , the central magnetars could be considered as a possible source to produce magnetically - dominated outflows and collimated jets with ultrarelativistic bulk lorentz factors ( e.g. , usov 1992 ; lyutikov 2006 ; uzdensky & macfadyen 2007 ; tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2008 ; metzger et al .",
    "2008a , bucciantini et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "for example , bucciantini et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) modeled the interaction between the wind from a newly formed rapidly rotating protomagnetar and the surrounding progenitor .",
    "the free - flowing wind from protomagnetar is not possible to achieve simultaneously collimation and acceleration to high lorentz factor .",
    "however , a bubble of relativistic plasma and a strong toroidal magnetic field created by the magnetar wind shocking on the surrounding stellar envelope can work together to drive a relativistic jet , which is possible to produce a long grbs and the associated type ic supernova .",
    "metzger et al . ( 2008a ) showed that protomagnetars are capable to produce neutron - rich long grb outflows for submillisecond rotation period @xmath282 ms .",
    "besides the study on the central magnetar , the properties of magnetized ndaf disk has also been studied .",
    "recently lei et al . ( 2009 ) investigated the properties of the ndaf with the magnetic torque acted between the central black hole and the disk .",
    "the neutrino annihilation luminosity can be increased by one order of magnitude higher for accretion rate @xmath283s@xmath13 , and the disk becomes thermally and viscously unstable in the inner region .",
    "therefore , it is also interesting to study the effects of ultra - highly magnetic fields of neutron stars or magnetars on hyperaccreting disks .",
    "in this paper we have studied the structure of a hyperaccreting disk around a neutron star based on the two - region scenario , and calculate the neutrino annihilation luminosity above the disks with different structures .",
    "the neutron - star disk model is still newtonian , vertically - integrated with one - dimensional variable radius @xmath284 , and based on the @xmath0-prescription .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath29 is the basic quantity to determine the properties of the disk and the annihilation luminosity , and we also discuss the effects of the energy parameter @xmath1 of the inner disk ( eqs . [ 13 ] , [ 35 ] to [ 39 ] ) , the viscosity parameter @xmath0 , the outflow structure and strength ( eqs . [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] ) , the neutrino emission for the stellar surface layer to increase the total annihilation energy rate ( eqs .",
    "[ 42 ] to [ 46 ] ) .",
    "we adopt the self - similar structure to describe the inner disk , in which the heating mechanism is different from the outer disk .",
    "table 2 shows the inner disk structure and size in various cases depending on the value of @xmath1 and the properties of the outflow from the disk .",
    "we introduce two disk outflow models in  3.3 . in model o1",
    ", we consider the outflow is mainly from the inner disk , while model o2 suggests that an outflow exists in the entire disk . in ",
    "5.1 , we also discuss the other possibilities of the entropy - conservation self - similar structure of the inner disk .",
    "compared to a high-@xmath0 disk ( @xmath285 ) , the size of a low-@xmath0 disk is smaller for a low accretion rate ( @xmath286 s@xmath13 ) and increases dramatically with increasing accretion rate ( fig .",
    "1 ) . a low-@xmath0 disk is denser , thinner with higher pressure and larger adiabatic index , and has a brighter neutrino luminosity ( fig .",
    "the size of the inner disk which satisfies the advection - dominated self - similar structure for @xmath3 becomes smaller for lower @xmath1 , and is much larger compared to the entropy - conservation inner disk for a low accretion rate ( @xmath287 s@xmath13 , fig .",
    "3 ) . in outflow model o1 ,",
    "the inner disk is larger for a stronger outflow with low accretion rate , but its size decreases with increasing the outflow index @xmath40 for a high accretion rate .",
    "moreover , the inner disk would not exist in outflow model o2 when the accretion rate @xmath288 s@xmath13 ( fig .",
    "the outflow in the entire disk decreases the density and pressure , but increases the thickness of the disk ( fig .",
    "the neutrino annihilation luminosity above the neutron - star disk @xmath212 is higher than the black - hole disk @xmath214 , and the difference between @xmath212 and @xmath214 is significant for a low accretion rate due to the different disk structure and neutrino luminosity between them ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "the neutrino emission from the neutron star surface boundary layer is produced in the process of disk matter accreting onto the surface , and the boundary emission can increase the total neutrino annihilation rate above the disk significantly for about one order of magnitude higher than the disk without boundary emission ( fig . 6 , fig .",
    "7 , fig . 8) .",
    "the disk with an advection - dominated inner disk could produce the highest neutrino luminosity while the disk with an outflow from the entire disk ( model o2 ) produces the lowest annihilation luminosity ( fig 7 , fig 8 , fig 9 ) .",
    "we show that the annihilation luminosity can reach @xmath12ergs s@xmath13 when the accretion rate @xmath276 s@xmath13 for neutron - star disks , while the higher accretion rate @xmath272 s@xmath13 is needed to reach @xmath12 ergs s@xmath13 for black - hole disks .",
    "therefore , the neutron - star disk can produce a sufficiently large annihilation luminosity than its black - hole counterpart .",
    "although a heavily mass - loaded outflow from the neutron star surface at early times of neutron star formation prevents the outflow material from being accelerated to a high bulk lorentz factor , an energetic relativistic jet can be produced above the stellar polar region at late times if the disk accretion rate and the neutrino emission luminosity from the surface boundary are sufficiently high .",
    "such relativistic jet may be further accelerated by jet - stellar - envelope interaction and produce the grb or grb - like events such as x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) .",
    "the outflow from the advection - dominated disk and low latitudes of the neutron star surface can be considered to provide the energy and sufficient @xmath289ni for successful supernova explosions associated with grbs or xrfs in some previous works .",
    "however , the energy produced via neutrino annihilation above the advection - dominated black - hole disk is usually not sufficient for relativistic ejecta and grbs .",
    "on the other hand , the advection - dominated disk around a neutron star can produce a much higher annihilation luminosity compared to the black - hole disk .",
    "outflow model o2 produces a higher neutrino annihilation rate but less outflow energy compared to model o1 , while the black - hole disk could provide the same order of outflow energy but even less annihilation energy compared to model o2 .",
    "therefore , observations on grb - sn connection would further constrain these models between hyperaccreting disks around black holes and neutron stars with outflows .",

    "<S> we further study the structure of such a neutron - star disk based on the two - region ( i.e. , inner & outer ) disk scenario following our previous work , and calculate the neutrino annihilation luminosity from the disk in various cases . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effects of the viscosity parameter @xmath0 , energy parameter @xmath1 ( measuring the neutrino cooling efficiency of the inner disk ) and outflow strength on the structure of the entire disk as well as the effect of emission from the neutron star surface boundary emission on the total neutrino annihilation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the inner disk satisfies the entropy - conservation self - similar structure for the energy parameter @xmath2 and the advection - dominated structure for @xmath3 . an outflow from the disk decreases the density and pressure but increases the thickness of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , compared with the black - hole disk , the neutrino annihilation luminosity above the neutron - star disk is higher , and the neutrino emission from the boundary layer could increase the neutrino annihilation luminosity by about one order of magnitude higher than the disk without boundary emission . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron - star disk with the advection - dominated inner disk could produce the highest neutrino luminosity while the disk with an outflow has the lowest . </S>",
    "<S> although a heavily mass - loaded outflow from the neutron star surface at early times of neutron star formation prevents the outflow material from being accelerated to a high bulk lorentz factor , an energetic ultrarelativistic jet via neutrino annihilation can be produced above the stellar polar region at late times if the disk accretion rate and the neutrino emission luminosity from the surface boundary layer are sufficiently high . </S>"
