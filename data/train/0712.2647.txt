    "the perspectives of exploiting electron spin for information processing in spintronic devices stimulated basic research of spin - related phenomena.@xcite in order to take advantage of traditional semiconductor technologies , the exclusive application of electric fields to generate and manipulate a nonequilibrium spin density is of particular interest . in this respect ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) provides an attractive mechanism for the pure electric manipulation of moving spins in nonmagnetic semiconductors .",
    "unfortunately , the very same soi depends on the carrier momentum , which is randomized by elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "this momentum dependence of the coupling leads to the dominant spin relaxation and dephasing in iii - v semiconductors known as dyakonov - perel relaxation mechanism.@xcite in general , however , details of spin dephasing depend on the involved scattering mechanisms , the band structure , and the crystal orientation ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an sizable anisotropy of the spin relaxation has been theoretically predicted  @xcite for semiconductor heterostructures grown along the [ 001 ] axis . according to these studies ,",
    "a large spin - relaxation anisotropy should exist for the in - plane spin polarization .",
    "moreover , under the condition that the strengths of rashba ( @xmath0 ) and dresselhaus ( @xmath1 ) spin - orbit coupling constants become equal ( @xmath2 ) , the anisotropy should be maximal . based on this observation a proposal for a novel spin - transistor device @xcite was put forward .",
    "recent experimental data provided strong evidence for a huge in - plane anisotropy of the spin dephasing time in [ 001 ] gaas / al@xmath3ga@xmath4as quantum wells.@xcite the efficient suppression of relaxation for spins aligned along the [ 110 ] orientation in heterostructures with equal rashba and dresselhaus soi strengths is an important result that certainly stimulates further progress in spintronics",
    ".    other promising structures for spintronic applications are quantum well samples grown along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "very long spin - relaxation times on the order of nanoseconds were experimentally demonstrated for the out - of plane spin polarization in such heterostructures.@xcite this effect is caused by the absence of dyakonov - perel spin relaxation in the particular crystal direction .",
    "the common physical origin for weak spin relaxation in [ 110 ] quantum wells as well as in [ 001 ] heterostructures with @xmath2 is the presence of an spin - rotation symmetry in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg).@xcite this symmetry is robust and leads to an infinite spin lifetime and a persistent spin helix for an idealized model .",
    "the theoretical explanation , which has recently been confirmed by experiment,@xcite will initiate a number of further studies in this field .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to contribute to this development by treating weakly damped eigen - excitations of the coupled spin - charge system subject to a constant electric field .",
    "our approach bears some similarities with a traditional field in solid state physics namely the study of space - charge waves in crystals.@xcite the electric - field - mediated excitations of the coupled spin - charge system are probed by a simulated experimental set up , which provides the wave vector to resonantly excite internal eigen - modes of the biased soi coupled 2deg .",
    "we focus on excitation mechanisms that exploit surface acoustic waves .",
    "our model is based on a hamiltonian that describes conduction band electrons in a iii - v semiconductor quantum well grown in the [ 001 ] direction , which is used to be the @xmath5 axis of the coordinate system @xmath6 the effective electron mass , the in - plane wave vector , and the pauli matrices are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "the precession frequencies @xmath11 are due to the soi , which contain both linear rashba and dresselhaus contributions @xmath12 with @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the respective spin - orbit coupling constants .",

    "the neglected cubic terms to the frequency vector @xmath11 play only a secondary role in our study . throughout this work",
    ", it is assumed that the spin - orbit coupling energy is much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath13 .",
    "the model is complemented by the inclusion of elastic scattering on a short - range impurity potential characterized by the elastic scattering time @xmath14 .    to elucidate the peculiarities of the spin - orbit coupled 2deg ,",
