    "the quantization of time - dependent harmonic oscillator is very important when we treat the coherent states , the squeezed states , and many other branches of physics .",
    "for example , the propagator of the quantum mechanical system with friction can be treated as a harmonic oscillator with time dependent mass @xcite .",
    "one of the most powerful method to find a quantum state of the oscillator is the generalized invariant method introduced by lewis and riesenfeld ( lr )  @xcite .",
    "recently , some of the authors obtained the most general form of the invariant and the general quantum states for the oscillator using the heisenberg picture when the mass and the frequency are explicitly time dependent  @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent harmonic oscillator with a perturbative force was considered by khandekar and lawande @xcite who found that the wave function and propagator depend only on the solution of a classical damped oscillator through a single function .",
    "the exact evolution operator for the harmonic oscillator subject to arbitrary force was obtained by lo  @xcite .",
    "he obtained the quantum states by solving the differential equation satisfied by the evolution operator .",
    "he also investigated the time evolution of a charged oscillator with a time dependent mass and frequency in a time - dependent field .",
    "we consider the forced harmonic oscillator , where the external force depends on time . even though lo found the solution in the general situation , the solutions are difficult to analyze the physical properties of the system . while , our formulations has an advantage in that point , since the classical solutions suffice to understand the corresponding quantum system .",
    "our choice of quantum state is different from those of ref .",
    "they choose the fock space in terms of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with the external force term suppressed . however , its ground state can not be the lowest - energy state since the external force lower the minimum of the potential , hence the zero - point energy .",
    "further , the dispersions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for those states are dependent on the external force .",
    "on the other hand , we construct the fock space in terms of the eigenstates of the generalized invariant for _ the forced oscillator .",
    "_ these number - states can be set equal to the ones of the hamiltonian by choosing the parameter properly .",
    "it should be emphasized that the dispersions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for these states are independent of the external forces .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the general formulation for finding the quantum solutions of the time - dependent forced harmonic oscillator using the lr invariant method . in sec .",
    "iii we find the quantum evolution of the heisenberg operator , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the time - evolution operator . in sec .",
