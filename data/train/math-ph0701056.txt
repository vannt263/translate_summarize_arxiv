    "historically , the karhunen - love arose as a tool from the interface of probability theory and information theory ; see details with references inside the paper .",
    "it has served as a powerful tool in a variety of applications ; starting with the problem of separating variables in stochastic processes , say @xmath0 ; processes that arise from statistical noise , for example from fractional brownian motion .",
    "since the initial inception in mathematical statistics , the operator algebraic contents of the arguments have crystallized as follows : starting from the process @xmath0 , for simplicity assume zero mean , i.e. , @xmath1 ; create a correlation matrix @xmath2 .",
    "( strictly speaking , it is not a matrix , but rather an integral kernel .",
    "nonetheless , the matrix terminology has stuck . )",
    "the next key analytic step in the karhunen - love method is to then apply the spectral theorem from operator theory to a corresponding selfadjoint operator , or to some operator naturally associated with @xmath3 : hence the name , the karhunen - love decomposition ( klc ) . in favorable cases ( discrete spectrum ) , an orthogonal family of functions @xmath4 in the time variable",
    "arise , and a corresponding family of eigenvalues .",
    "we take them to be normalized in a suitably chosen square - norm . by integrating the basis functions @xmath5 against @xmath0",
    ", we get a sequence of random variables @xmath6 .",
    "it was the insight of karhunen - love @xcite to give general conditions for when this sequence of random variables is independent , and to show that if the initial random process @xmath0 is gaussian , then so are the random variables @xmath6 .",
    "( see also example 3.1 below . )    in the 1940s , kari karhunen ( @xcite , @xcite ) pioneered the use of spectral theoretic methods in the analysis of time series , and more generally in stochastic processes .",
    "it was followed up by papers and books by michel love in the 1950s @xcite , and in 1965 by r.b .",
    "ash @xcite .",
    "( note that this theory precedes the surge in the interest in wavelet bases ! )",
    "as we outline below , all the settings place rather stronger assumptions .",
    "we argue how more modern applications dictate more general theorems , which we prove in our paper .",
    "a modern tool from operator theory and signal processing which we will use is the notion of _ frames _ in hilbert space .",
    "more precisely , frames are redundant  bases \" in hilbert space .",
    "they are called framed , but intuitively should be thought of as generalized bases . the reason for this , as we show , is that they offer an explicit choice of a ( non - orthogonal ) expansion of vectors in the hilbert space under consideration .    in our paper",
    ", we rely on the classical literature ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and we accomplish three things : ( i ) we extend the original karhunen - love idea to case of continuous spectrum ; ( ii ) we give frame theoretic uses of the karhunen - love idea which arise in various wavelet contexts and which go beyond the initial uses of karhunen - love ; and finally ( iii ) to give applications .    these applications in our case come from image analysis ; specifically from the problem of statistical recognition and detection ; e.g. , to nonlinear variance , for example due to illumination effects .",
    "then the karhunen - love decomposition ( kld ) , also known as principal component analysis ( pca ) applies to the intensity images .",
    "this is traditional in statistical signal detection and in estimation theory .",
    "adaptations to compression and recognition are of a more recent vintage . in brief outline , each intensity image is converted into vector form .",
    "( this is the simplest case of a purely intensity - based coding of the image , and it is not necessarily ideal for the application of kl - decompositions . )    the ensemble of vectors used in a particular conversion of images is assumed to have a multi - variate gaussian distribution since human faces form a dense cluster in image space .",
    "the pca method generates small set of basis vectors forming subspaces whose linear combination offer better ( or perhaps ideal ) approximation to the original vectors in the ensemble . in facial recognition ,",
    "the new bases are said to span intra - face and inter - face variations , permitting euclidean distance measurements to exclusively pick up changes in for example identity and expression .",
    "our presentation will start with various operator theoretic tools , including frame representations in hilbert space .",
    "we have included more details and more explanations than is customary in more narrowly focused papers , as we wish to cover the union of four overlapping fields of specialization , operator theory , information theory , wavelets , and physics applications .    while entropy encoding is popular in engineering , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the choices made in signal processing are often more by trial and error than by theory .",
    "reviewing the literature , we found that the mathematical foundation of the current use of entropy in encoding deserves closer attention .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the fact that hilbert space and operator theory form the common language of both quantum mechanics and of signal / image processing .",
    "recall first that in quantum mechanics , ( pure ) states as mathematical entities  are \" one - dimensional subspaces in complex hilbert space @xmath7 , so we may represent them by vectors of norm one .",
    "observables  are \" selfadjoint operators in @xmath7 , and the measurement problem entails von neumann s spectral theorem applied to the operators .    in signal processing , time - series , or matrices of pixel numbers may similarly be realized by vectors in hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "the probability distribution of quantum mechanical observables ( state space @xmath7 ) may be represented by choices of orthonormal bases ( onbs ) in @xmath7 in the usual way ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in signal",
    "/ image processing , because of aliasing , it is practical to generalize the notion of onb , and this takes the form of what is called `` a system of frame vectors '' ; see @xcite .",
    "but even von neumann s measurement problem , viewing experimental data as part of a bigger environment ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) leads to basis notions more general than onbs .",
    "they are commonly known as positive operator valued measures ( povms ) , and in the present paper we examine the common ground between the two seemingly different uses of operator theory in the separate applications . to make the paper presentable to two audiences",
    ", we have included a few more details than is customary in pure math papers .",
    "we show that parallel problems in quantum mechanics and in signal processing entail the choice of  good \" orthonormal bases ( onbs ) .",
    "one particular such onb goes under the name  the karhunen - love basis . \"",
    "we will show that it is optimal in three ways , and we will outline a number of applications .",
    "the problem addressed in this paper is motivated by consideration of the optimal choices of bases for certain analogue - to - digital ( a - to - d ) problems we encountered in the use of wavelet bases in image - processing ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; but certain of our considerations have an operator theoretic flavor which we wish to isolate , as it seems to be of independent interest .",
    "there are several reasons why we take this approach .",
    "firstly our hilbert space results seem to be of general interest outside the particular applied context where we encountered them . and",
    "secondly , we feel that our more abstract results might inspire workers in operator theory and approximation theory .      in digital image compression , after the quantization ( see figure [ f : outline ] )",
    "entropy encoding is performed on a particular image for more efficient - less storage memory - storage . when an image is to be stored we need either 8 bits or 16 bits to store a pixel .",
    "with efficient entropy encoding , we can use a smaller number of bits to represent a pixel in an image , resulting in less memory used to store or even transmit an image .",
    "thus , the karhunen - love theorem enables us to pick the best basis thus to minimize the entropy and error , to better represent an image for optimal storage or transmission . here , _",
    "optimal _ means it uses least memory space to represent the data .",
    "i.e. , instead of using 16 bits , it uses 11 bits .",
    "so , the best basis found would allow us to better represent the digital image with less storage memory .",
    "[ f : outline ]        in our next section we give the general context and definitions from operators in hilbert space which we shall need : we discuss the particular orthonomal bases ( onbs ) and frames which we use , and we recall the operator theoretic context of the karhunen - love theorem @xcite . in approximation problems involving a stochastic component ( for example noise removal in time - series or data resulting from image processing ) one typically ends up with correlation kernels ; in some cases as frame kernels ; see details in section [ sec:5 ] . in some cases",
    "they arise from systems of vectors in hilbert space which form frames ( see definition [ d : frame ] ) . in some cases parts of the frame vectors fuse ( fusion frames ) onto closed subspaces , and we will be working with the corresponding family of ( orthogonal ) projections . either way , we arrive at a family of selfadjoint positive semidefinite operators in hilbert space .",
    "the particular hilbert space depends on the application at hand .",
    "while the spectral theorem does allow us to diagonalize these operators , the direct application the spectral theorem may lead to continuous spectrum which is not directly useful in computations , or it may not be computable by recursive algorithms . as a result we introduce in section [ sec:7 ] a weighting of the operator to be analyzed .",
    "the questions we address are optimality of approximation in a variety of onbs , and the choice of the  best \" onb . here  best \" is given two precise meanings : ( 1 ) in the computation of a sequence of approximations to the frame vectors , the error terms must be smallest possible ; and similarly ( 2 ) we wish to minimize the corresponding sequence of entropy numbers ( referring to von neumann s entropy ) . in two theorems",
    "we make precise an operator theoretic karhunen - love basis , which we show is optimal both in regards to criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "but before we prove our theorems , we give the two problems an operator theoretic formulation ; and in fact our theorems are stated in this operator theoretic context .",
    "in section [ sec:7 ] , we introduce the weighting , and we address a third optimality criteria ; that of optimal weights : among all the choices of weights ( taking the form of certain discrete probability distributions ) turning the initially given operator into trace - class , the problem is then to select the particular weights which are optimal in a sense which we define precisely .",
    "in computing probabilities and entropy hilbert space serves as a helpful tool . as an example take a unit vector @xmath8 in some fixed hilbert space @xmath7 , and an orthonormal basis ( onb ) @xmath9 with @xmath10 running over an index set @xmath11 . with this",
    "we now introduce two families of probability measures , one family @xmath12 indexed by @xmath13 , and a second family @xmath14 indexed by a class of operators @xmath15 .",
    "define @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and where @xmath19 denotes the inner product . following physics convention",
    ", we make our inner product linear in the second variable .",
    "that will also let us make use of dirac s convenient notation for rank - one operators , see eq ( [ e : dirac2 ] ) below .",
    "note then that @xmath20 is a probability measure on the finite subsets @xmath21 of @xmath11 . to begin with",
    ", we make the restriction to finite subsets .",
    "this is merely for later use in recursive systems , see e.g. , eq ( [ e : p_f ] ) . in diverse contexts , extensions from finite to infinite",
    "is then done by means of kolmogorov s consistency principle @xcite .    by introducing a weighting",
    "we show that this assigment also works for more general vector configurations @xmath22 than onbs .",
    "vectors in @xmath22 may represent signals or image fragments / blocks .",
    "correlations would then be measured as inner products @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 representing different image pixels . or in the case of signals , @xmath24 and @xmath25 might represent different frequency subbands .",
    "a second more general family of probability measures arising in the context of hilbert space is called determinantal measures .",
    "specifically , consider bitstreams as points in an infinite cartesian product @xmath26 .",
    "cylinder sets in @xmath27 are indexed by finite subsets @xmath28 , @xmath29 if @xmath30 is an operator in @xmath31 such that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 , then set @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the matrix representation of @xmath30 computed in some onb in @xmath36 .",
    "using general principles @xcite it can be checked that @xmath37 is independent of the choice of onb .    to verify that @xmath38 extends to a probability measure defined on the sigma - algebra generated by @xmath39 , see e.g. @xcite , ch7 .",
    "the argument is based on kolmogorov s consistency principle , see @xcite    frames ( definition [ d : g - op ] ) are popular in analyzing signals and images .",
    "this fact raises questions of comparing two approximations : one using a frame the other using an onb .",
    "however , there are several possible choices of onbs .",
    "an especially natural choice of an onb would be one diagonalizes the matrix @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a frame .",
    "we call such a choice of onb kahunen - love ( k - l ) expansion",
    ". section [ sec : kl ] deals with a continuous version of this matrix problem .",
    "the justification for why diagonalization occurs and works also when the frame @xmath41 is infinite that is based on the spectral theorem . for the details regarding this , see the proof of theorem [ t:3.3 ] below .    in symbols ,",
    "we designate the k - l onb associated to the frame @xmath41 as @xmath42 . in computations ,",
    "we must rely on finite sums , and we are interested in estimating the errors when different approximations are used , and where summations are truncated .",
    "our main results make precise how the k - l onb yields better approximations , smaller entropy and better synthesis .",
    "even more we show that infimum calculations yield minimum numbers attained at the k - l onb expansions .",
    "we emphasize that the onb depends on the frame chosen , and this point will be discussed in detail later .    if larger systems are subdivided the smaller parts may be represented by projections @xmath43 , and the @xmath44 correlations by the operators @xmath45 .",
    "the entire family @xmath46 is to be treated as a fusion frame @xcite .",
    "fusion frames are defined in definition [ d : fusionf ] below .",
    "frames themselves are generalized bases with redundancy , for example occurring in signal processing involving multiplexing .",
    "the fusion frames allow decompositions with closed subspaces as opposed to individual vectors .",
    "they allow decompositions of signal / image processing tasks with degrees of homogeneity .",
    "[ d : h ] let @xmath7 be a hilbert space .",

    "usually @xmath48 if @xmath49 is an onb , we set @xmath50 the orthogonal projection onto @xmath51 .",
    "we now introduce a few facts about operators which will be needed in the paper .",

    "for example , in the middle term in eq ( [ e : dirac3 ] ) , the vector @xmath24 is multiplied by a scalar , the inner product ; and the inner product comes about by just merging the two vectors .",

    "it enables us to assign the smallest number of bits for the pixel that has the highest probability , then the next number to the pixel value that has second highest probability , and so forth ; thus the pixel that has smallest probability gets assigned the highest value among all the other pixel values .",
    "one might think that the quantization step suffices for compression .",
    "it is true that the quantization does compress the data tremendously .",
    "after the quantization step many of the pixel values are either eliminated or replaced with other suitable values . however , those pixel values are still represented with either 8 or 16 bits .",
