    "<S> we discuss the physical interpretation of a dynamical and inhomogeneous spherically symmetric solution obtained by fonarev for a scalar field with an exponential potential . there is a single parameter @xmath0 in the solution which can be set to @xmath1 if it is non - zero , in addition to the steepness parameter @xmath2 in the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the spacetime is conformally static and asymptotically flat friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the solution reduces to the friedmann - robertson - walker solution for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two curvature singularities , of which one is a timelike central singularity and the other is a big - bang or big - crunch type singularity . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the parameters , the spacetime can possess a future outer trapping horizon in the collapsing case . </S>",
    "<S> then the solution represents a dynamical black hole in the sense of hayward although there is a locally naked singularity at the center and no black - hole event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates a weak point of the local definition of a black hole in terms of a trapping horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> einstein equations are so complicated simultaneous nonlinear partial differential equations that it is hopeless to obtain general solutions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spacetime symmetries are often assumed to make the system more tractable . </S>",
    "<S> although such spacetimes with high symmetries are idealized ones , they have occupied an important position in the history of gravitation research as touchstones to know the essential physics  @xcite .    for example , the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model plays a central role in modern cosmology as the zeroth - order approximation of the present universe , on which the behavior of the density perturbations has been particularly investigated to clarify the origin of the large - scale structure of the universe or to determine the cosmological parameters from the observations of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite . from the analyses of the stationary and asymptotically flat black - hole spacetime such as the schwarzschild or kerr solution , </S>",
    "<S> tremendous results have been derived , among which the most remarkable one is the black - hole thermodynamics  @xcite .    on the other hand , there are many open problems on the dynamical aspects of einstein equations such as dynamical black holes or their formations . in homogeneous or stationary spacetimes , </S>",
    "<S> einstein equations reduce to a set of ordinary differential equations , which is comparatively easy to handle , however , the formation or the growth of a black hole is essentially a dynamical and inhomogeneous process , where we have to struggle with a set of partial differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , numerical methods have often been used to study such systems . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the few dynamical and inhomogeneous exact solutions have been found . </S>",
    "<S> such precious solutions should be intensively investigated to complement the numerical works .    </S>",
    "<S> scalar fields are fundamental fields which naturally exist in a variety of theories . in spherically symmetric spacetimes , </S>",
    "<S> the system with the simplest massless scalar field has been fully investigated . </S>",
    "<S> there are two important dynamical and inhomogeneous exact solutions in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the first one was obtained by roberts  @xcite , and subsequently the other one was obtained by husain , martinez and nez  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical aspects of the system with a massless scalar field have been investigated in the numerical studies of the gravitational collapse , especially in the context of critical phenomena pioneered by choptuik  @xcite ( see  @xcite for the review ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic proof of the cosmic censorship hypothesis by christodoulou is a significant milestone  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these two exact solutions are not directly related to these results , the potential importance of them would go without saying .    </S>",
    "<S> the case with potentials is a natural generalization of the massless case . in various theories , </S>",
    "<S> scalar fields have their specific potentials . among them , an exponential potential arises naturally in supergravity  @xcite or theories obtained through dimensional reduction to effective four - dimensional theories  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the existence of exact solutions in such systems must be useful as a touchstone for the future research . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized husain - martinez - nez ( hmn ) solution in the presence of an exponential potential was obtained by fonarev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the properties of the solution have not been studied in details and the physical interpretation of the solution is still not clear . in this letter , we discuss the physical interpretation of the fonarev solution . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the properties of the trapping horizon and show the global structure of the solution . </S>",

    "<S> let us consider whether the scalar field has a non - trivial configuration or not </S>",
    "<S> . we should be careful that there is no natural time - slicing in general spherically symmetric spacetimes , so the derivative of the scalar field must have a spacelike portion to have the non - trivial configuration in a correct sense . for the fonarev solution , </S>",

    "<S> next let us consider the case with @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of @xmath74 are then given as @xmath85 defined by    @xmath86}{2(3\\alpha^2 - 2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can show that @xmath87 holds for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 with equality holding for @xmath91 , while @xmath92 holds for @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> we can also show that @xmath94 holds for @xmath95 , while @xmath96 holds for @xmath88 , @xmath97 , and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is concluded that the trapping horizon is timelike for @xmath93 and spacelike for @xmath91 , while in other cases it has both timelike and spacelike portions . for @xmath98 , </S>",
    "<S> the trapping horizon is timelike for @xmath99 and spacelike for @xmath100 . for @xmath95 , </S>",
    "<S> the trapping horizon is timelike for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , while it is spacelike for @xmath103 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have now found that the properties of the trapping horizon are different from that in the hmn solution corresponding to @xmath91 , which is spacelike . </S>",
    "<S> a local definition of a black hole in terms of a trapping horizon was given by hayward  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , a future outer trapping horizon is a black - hole horizon , which corresponds to a spacelike trapping horizon in the collapsing region . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a spacelike trapping horizon in the expanding region is a future inner trapping horizon corresponding to a white - hole or cosmological horizon . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there exists a black - hole trapping horizon for @xmath88 ( corresponding to @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 ( corresponding to @xmath106 ) .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the solution represents a dynamical black hole in the sense of hayward with the non - trivial configuration of a scalar field , i.e. , a scalar hair , in the collapsing case with @xmath107 , where the asymptotic frw solution is decelerating . </S>",
    "<S> the penrose diagrams of the fonarev solution are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ penrose ] .     </S>",
    "<S> the penrose diagrams for the fonarev solution in the collapsing case with @xmath33 and ( a ) @xmath108 and ( b ) @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> a zigzag line corresponds to a curvature singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the central timelike singularity is at @xmath109 and @xmath34 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively . for @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> it is replaced by a regular center . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams in the expanding cases are obtained by setting the figures upside - down . ]    in the static and asymptotically flat case , the scalar no - hair theorem is available , in which the scalar field must have a trivial configuration for a black - hole solution for the arbitrary positive semidefinite potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scalar no - hair theorem was extended into the asymptotically de  sitter case in the presence of the convex potential  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a counter example was numerically constructed in the asymptotically anti - de  sitter case , which violates the null energy condition  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the scalar no - hair theorem also holds in general dynamical and inhomogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes with certain energy conditions , a scalar field must have a trivial configuration for black - hole solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the contraposition of this statement is that if a scalar field has a non - trivial configuration , the solution is not a black - hole solution . </S>",
    "<S> then , does the fonarev solution suggest that the scalar no - hair theorem can be extended into general spherically symmetric spacetimes ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is `` no '' in the sense of hayward . </S>",
    "<S> however , here we face with the subtlety of the definition of a black hole .    although the solution represents a dynamical black hole in the sense of hayward , the singularity inside that trapping horizon is the big - crunch type spacelike singularity , and the central singularity is timelike and not covered by trapped surfaces . furthermore , there is no black - hole event horizon in this spacetime since there is no future null infinity . from these viewpoints , </S>",
    "<S> it might be proper to say that the fonarev solution as well as the hmn solution represents not a black hole but a naked singularity . </S>",
    "<S> then , the answer to the above question turns to be `` yes '' .    </S>",
    "<S> these solutions may demonstrate a weak point of the local definition of a black hole in terms of a trapping horizon . in order to rule out such solutions </S>",
    "<S> , we should require additional conditions in the definition by a trapping horizon or another local definition of a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> further investigations are needed to have much insight into this problem . </S>"
