    "we estimate @xmath3 from a variety of simulated galaxy distributions , created by applying simple local and deterministic biasing algorithms to the mass distributions obtained from cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "the * cosmological models * that we use are : ( 1 ) @xmath6 , cdm model with a tilted power spectrum designed to simultaneously satisfy both cobe and cluster normalization constraints .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath7 , cdm , cluster normalized model . ( 3 ) @xmath8 , cdm , cluster normalized model .",
    "cluster normalization requires that @xmath9 ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ) .",
    "the * biasing algorithms * that we use are : ( 1 ) semi - analytic : an empirical bias prescription derived by narayanan et al .",

    "( square - root exponential ) : a biasing prescription in which @xmath10 .",
    "( 3 ) power - law : a biasing prescription in which @xmath11 . here ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the galaxy and mass over - densities , respectively .",
    "all the bias models are designed to yield galaxy distributions with an rms fluctuation , in top - hat spheres of radius @xmath14mpc , of @xmath15 .",
    "the values of @xmath16 for the galaxy distributions are 0.6 , 0.58 , and 0.56 for @xmath6 , 0.4 , and 0.2 , respectively .",
    "all the results have been averaged over four independent realizations of the cosmological models .",
    "the simulation volumes are periodic cubes , with a box size of @xmath17mpc .    the first method that we use to estimate @xmath3 involves the anisotropy of the redshift - space power spectrum .",
    "kaiser ( 1987 ) and cole , fisher & weinberg ( 1994 ) showed that in linear theory , and under the plane - parallel approximation , the multipole moments of the redshift - space power spectrum may be used to estimate @xmath3 . here",
    "we employ two different @xmath3 estimators : @xmath18 , the ratio of the angle - averaged redshift - space power spectrum ( monopole ) to the real - space power spectrum , and @xmath19 , the ratio of the quadrupole and monopole moments of the redshift - space power spectrum .",
    "these ratios are , in principle , measurable , and they are related to @xmath3 as follows : @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "these ratios yield an estimate of @xmath3 at each wavenumber @xmath22 , and the scale dependence of this estimate is caused mainly by non - linearity in the peculiar velocity field .",
    "it is possible to obtain a global estimate of @xmath3 by modeling this non - linearity .",
    "we use two such models in our analysis : ( 1 ) exponential velocity distribution model ( cole , fisher & weinberg 1995 ) , where we assume that the galaxies have uncorrelated small scale peculiar velocities which are drawn from an exponential distribution .",
    "we use this model in our analysis of @xmath18 ( the results of which are shown in fig .",
    "( 2 ) empirical model ( hatton & cole 1999 ) , where the scale dependence of @xmath19 is found empirically by examining a large number of n - body simulations spanning a broad range of parameter space .",
    "the second method that we use to estimate @xmath3 involves a direct comparison between the mass and galaxy density fields . the potent method ( bertschinger & dekel 1989 ) reconstructs the full three dimensional peculiar velocity field @xmath23 from the observed radial peculiar velocity field , allowing a measurement of @xmath3 directly from the linear theory relation @xmath24 .",
    "we estimate @xmath3 using an idealized potent method , in which we have perfectly reconstructed the three dimensional peculiar velocity field .",
    "we obtain the value of @xmath3 by fitting a line of the form @xmath25 to the @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 relation .",
    "we perform this fit in the region : @xmath28 . by repeating this procedure for different smoothing of the velocity and density fields",
    ", we can measure @xmath3 as a function of scale ( see fig .",
    "figure 1 compares @xmath3 estimates from the two methods described previously to the function @xmath29 . here , @xmath5 is the bias function defined as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the rms fluctuations of the galaxy and mass density fields , smoothed with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath33 , of the galaxy and mass distributions , respectively . in our full analysis , we also compare our @xmath3 estimates to the function @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the bias function defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the power spectra of the galaxy and mass distributions , respectively . in the case of a simple , linear bias model , @xmath39 , all these definitions of @xmath2 are equivalent , i.e. , @xmath40 .    in most cases ,",
    "we find that the bias factor @xmath4 derived from redshift - space anisotropy or potent is similar to the large - scale value of @xmath35 or @xmath5 defined by rms fluctuation amplitudes . discrepancies at the 10 - 20% level may reflect non - linear dynamics as much as non - linearity of bias , since they also occur for unbiased models . in greater detail : ( 1 ) measurements of @xmath3 derived by fitting the cole et al .",
    "( 1995 ) exponential velocity distribution model to @xmath18 underestimate the large - scale values of @xmath41 by about 10 - 20% for all cosmological models and biasing prescriptions .",
    "( 2 ) measurements of @xmath3 derived by fitting the hatton & cole ( 1999 ) empirical model to @xmath19 accurately reproduce the large - scale values of @xmath41 for all cosmological models and biasing prescriptions .",
    "( 3 ) measurements of @xmath42 derived from a potent - like comparison of @xmath26 , the negative divergence of the peculiar velocity field , to @xmath27 , the galaxy density field , underestimate the large - scale values of @xmath43 by about 10 - 20% for all cosmological models and biasing prescriptions , with the exception of the sqrt - exp . biasing prescription .",
    "the sqrt - exp .",
    "model gives erratic results because the non - linearity of the bias model makes the estimated @xmath3 sensitive to the range of @xmath27 used in the linear fit .",
    "( 4 ) estimates of @xmath3 from the anisotropy of the redshift - space power spectrum approximately agree with those from the potent method on large scales , except in the case of the sqrt - exp . model .",
