    "the causal dynamical triangulation ( cdt ) model was first introduced in ref . as a non - perturbative theory of quantum gravity . the basic idea behind this model is to interpret the gravitational path - integral by discretizing spacetime manifolds through so - called _",
    "causal triangulations_. thus , the problem of computing the gravitational path - integral is replaced by a statistical mechanical problem , that is the study of the partition function of an ensemble of finite random triangulations , whose weight is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath0}$ ] , where @xmath1 $ ] is the discrete einstein - hilbert action .",
    "having described the partition function , one can study its `` thermodynamic '' limit , when the size of triangulations grows to infinity .",
    "we refer the reader to ref . , where the subject is treated in detail .",
    "even in two dimensions , the cdt model turns out to possess a rich mathematical structure .",
    "in particular , it has been proved ( see refs . )",
    "that it is critical at a certain ( known ) value @xmath2 of the cosmological constant .",
    "this critical behaviour is reflected in the geometrical properties ( hausdorff and spectral dimensions ) of the infinite triangulations : they show 2-dimensional features at criticality , whereas in the subcritical regime they are essentially 1-dimensional .",
    "matter is inserted in the theory by running a statistical mechanical model on the random triangulation .",
    "technically , this can be implemented by weighting the boltzmann factor associated to each triangulation @xmath3 with the partition function of an ising model running on @xmath3 .",
    "this is generally called _ annealed _ coupling ( see ref . for further details ) .    as in the pure gravity case",
    ", the coupled model is believed to become critical when the parameters of the model ( the cosmological constant @xmath4 and the inverse temperature @xmath5 of the spin system ) are suitably tuned .",
    "however , the exact value of the critical parameters are still unknown and only bounds on the region where they lie have been provided ( see refs . and ) .",
    "in this paper we review some recent results , first appeared in ref .",
    ", on the annealed coupling between the ising model and the random causal triangulations of the plane .",
    "in particular , we show the existence of a critical line in the positive @xmath6 quarter plane , give a description of some of its analytical properties and provide bounds on the region where the critical line is located .",
    "furthermore , we add some new results on the relation between the critical line and its dual .",
    "[ dm ] a _ causal triangulation _ @xmath3 is a rooted planar locally finite connected graph satisfying the following properties .    1 .",
    "the set of vertices at graph distance @xmath7 from the root , together with the edges connecting them , form a cycle , denoted by @xmath8 and called @xmath7-th _ slice _ ( when there is only one vertex the corresponding cycle has only one edge , i.e. it is a loop ) .",
    "2 .   all faces of the graph are triangles , with the only exception of the external face .",
    "one edge attached to the root vertex is marked , we call it _ root edge_.    the last condition in the above definition is a technical requirement , needed to cancel out possible rotational symmetries around the root .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the set of causal triangulations with @xmath10 slices and fixed number @xmath11 of vertices on @xmath12 . in the following",
    ", we shall denote by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the vertex set , the edge set and the triangles set of @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the cardinality of a set @xmath16 will be denote by @xmath17 .    given a triangulation @xmath18 ,",
    "a spin configuration @xmath19 on @xmath3 is an element of the set @xmath20    the partition function of the coupled system ( ising model and random causal triangulations ) is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse temperature , @xmath23 is the cosmological constant and @xmath24 is the classical nearest - neighbour spin interaction hamiltonian .",
    "since the set @xmath9 is countable , the series defined in ( [ z ] ) might diverge . on the other hand , for any fixed @xmath22 , each term of the series is a positive and strictly decreasing function of @xmath4 , therefore there exists a value @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 , for any @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , for any @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to see that the sequence @xmath25 is bounded from above .",
    "indeed , from the inequality @xmath30 it follows that @xmath31 where the series on the right is finite ( see ref . ) for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 whenever @xmath32 .",
    "therefore @xmath33    in the following theorem , we prove the existence of a critical value @xmath34 for each @xmath35 , above which the partition function is finite for any @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "[ te1 ] for each @xmath22 and @xmath36 , as @xmath37 @xmath38 where the limit exists and does not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath39 is non - decreasing in @xmath5 .",
    "first we show that for each @xmath22 and @xmath36 function @xmath25 is non - decreasing in @xmath10 .",
    "consider the partition function in ( [ z ] ) for the triangulations with a fixed last slice @xmath12 with @xmath40 vertices .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the following bound @xmath41    hence , if @xmath42 for some @xmath11 then also @xmath43 .",
    "this implies for any @xmath44 @xmath45 when @xmath46 this together with the uniform bound ( [ u ] ) yields existence of @xmath47 and then also by ( [ z3 ] ) for any fixed @xmath48 @xmath49 as well as @xmath50 we conclude that for any fixed @xmath40 there exists @xmath34 such that @xmath51 this proves statement ( [ t1 ] ) .    to prove the monotonicity of @xmath34 consider again @xmath52 .",
    "assume , @xmath53 then @xmath54 but for any @xmath18 and @xmath55 @xmath56 by the first griffiths inequality for ferromagnetic spin systems .",
    "hence , @xmath57 i.e. , for any @xmath58 @xmath59 which in turn yields @xmath60 then monotonicity of @xmath34 follows from here by the statement ( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "since the function @xmath34 is non - negative and bounded from above by a linear function ( see ( [ u ] ) ) , its monotonicity implies that it has at most a countable number of jumps .",
    "therefore we shall call the graph of @xmath34 , @xmath22 , _ the critical line_.    theorem [ te1 ] implies that @xmath61 , and therefore by a theorem of ref .",
    "proved for @xmath62 , we immediately have the following result .",
    "[ thm : cr_bounds ] the critical line @xmath34 is monotone non - decreasing , it has at most a countable number of jumps and it is contained in the region of the @xmath6-plane defined by @xmath63 where @xmath64    above the critical line , that is in the region @xmath65 the partition function is finite for all @xmath10 ( and @xmath11 ) .",
    "we call this",
    "_ subcritical region_. on the other hand , below the critical line , for each @xmath6 , @xmath66 for @xmath10 large enough .    furthermore , from thm .",

    "( [ eq : crl_inf ] ) shows that the ground - state spin configurations are dominant at low temperature , as expected ( see ref . ) .",
    "in this section we compare the partition function ( [ z ] ) , to the partition function of the system constructed by placing the ising spins on the faces of a causal triangulation , that is on the vertices of the dual graph @xmath68 of a causal triangulation @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the partition function of the dual model is defined as @xmath69    applying a kramers - wannier duality argument , it can be shown ( see ref . ) that the partition functions of the two systems are related by the equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are such that @xmath73    equation ( [ eq : zduz ] ) implies that the subcritical region of the original model is bijectively mapped onto the subcritical region of the dual model by the transformations ( [ eq : tempdual])-([eq : cosmdual ] ) .",
    "hence , in particular the critical lines of the two models are related by the equation @xmath74    by the relation ( [ eq : mucrdual_mucr ] ) , thm .",
    "[ thm : cr_bounds ] implies the following",
    ".    the dual critical line @xmath75 is monotone non - decreasing , it has at most a countable number of jumps and it is contained in the region of the @xmath76-plane defined by    @xmath77    where @xmath78    in particular , we have the following asymptotic results @xmath79",
    "in this paper we presented some results on the annealed coupling of an ising model and the causal dynamical triangulation model .",
    "we proved the existence of a critical line @xmath80 delimiting the region of the @xmath6-plane where the partition function @xmath81 of the system is finite for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 and showed that the critical line is a monotone non - decreasing function of @xmath82 and has at most a countable number of jumps .",
    "moreover , the critical line is proved to lie in a region of the plane shrinking to a straight line when @xmath83 .",
    "this gives in turn the exact asymptotic behaviour of the critical line and shows that ground - state spin configurations are dominant at low temperature .",
    "in addition , we obtained exact relations between the partition functions of the model itself and its dual , as well as between their critical lines ."
