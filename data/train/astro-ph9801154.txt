    "according to the hubble law , @xmath2 , the recession velocity @xmath3 of a galaxy , inferred from its redshift , is proportional to its proper distance from the observer , @xmath4 .",
    "irregularities gravitationally generate peculiar velocities ( @xmath5 ) , so that the true relationship is @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the line of sight component of the peculiar motion",
    ". maps of galaxy positions constructed by assuming that velocities are exactly proportional to distance ( redshift space ) have two principal distortions .",
    "the first is generated in dense collapsed structures where there are very many galaxies at essentially the same distance from the observer , each with a random peculiar motion .",
    "this results in a radial stretching of the structure known as a `` finger of god '' .",
    "the second effect acts on much larger scales ( e.g. kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "a large overdensity generates coherent bulk motions in the galaxy distribution as it collapses .",
    "material generally flows towards the center of the structure , i.e. towards the observer for material on the far side of the structure and away from the observer on the near side so it will appear compressed along the line of sight .",
    "this tends to make voids bigger and the walls between them denser .",
    "one particularly important unresolved issue is the value of the cosmological density parameter , @xmath1 , which determines whether the universe will expand forever ( @xmath7 ) , or eventually recollapse ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "see e.g. coles and ellis ( 1997 ) for a review .",
    "while redshift - space distortions are a nuisance when one wants to construct accurate maps of the ( true ) spatial distribution of galaxies , they may lead to a robust determination of @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , applications of this idea to existing data have so far yielded inconclusive results for @xmath1 ( hamilton 1998 and references therein ) and recent studies indicate that systematic errors in the standard approaches are likely to be less manageable than has previously been supposed ( e.g. hatton & cole 1997 ; see also de laix and starkman 1997 ) .",
    "we propose here an entirely new approach to the analysis of these distortions , based on the statistics of the spacing of features ( praton & schneider 1994 ; praton , melott & mckee 1997 ) both orthogonal and tangential to the observer s line of sight in redshift space : the `` bulls - eye effect . '' praton et al . ( 1997 ) showed that preferentially concentric redshift space features emerging in n  body simulations were dynamical in origin with only very small additional contributions from survey geometry or magnitude limits .",
    "simulations with no peculiar velocities or with randomized velocities show no enhanced bulls  eye pattern .",
    "we show herein a method of quantifying this difference in the redshift direction , which depends on large  scale motions .",
    "this approach bypasses much of the bias dependence implicit in the standard methods of analysis , possibly leading to a much cleaner determination of the density parameter @xmath1 .",
    "further , this effect exists independent of the selection function .",
    "a selection function may mildly enhance the visual prominence of the effect , but it is created by redshift distortions .",
    "concentric rings seem to appear in such surveys as las campanas ( schectman et .",
    "al 1996 ) and cnoc2 ( yee et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we have developed a quantitative method to detect this signal , which is useful in distinguishing between high and low @xmath1 .",
    "if peculiar velocities are low , and observed concentric structures are not enhanced in redshift space ( as advocated for the great wall by dellantonio et .",
    "al 1996 ) , this is not a refutation of the bulls - eye effect .",
    "it is evidence for low @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of peculiar motions is to increase the spacing of large ",
    "scale structures in the radial direction as compared with real space , as we show quantitatively below .",
    "the enhancement is @xmath1dependent .",
    "it is on the basis of this visually - striking difference between the redshift - space behavior of low - density and high - density dynamics that we propose a statistic that reproduces the eye s sensitivity to differences in pattern .",
    "it is easier to introduce and explain this effect in the small  angle approximation to redshift space .",
    "a distant patch of the universe will have nearly parallel radii and perpendicular to it circular arc segments of constant @xmath9 . in figure 1",
    ", we show an array of plots from such a cartesian n ",
    "body simulation , described fully in beacom et .",
    "al ( 1991 ) .",
    "upper left and right represent sequential stages .",
    "the two lower plots show the stage at the upper left viewed along its @xmath10 or @xmath11 axes in redshift space .",
    "there is considerable large ",
    "scale displacement in this @xmath12 model , which acts to somewhat anticipate structures that will appear later in real space ( upper right ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the same thing in an @xmath13 simulation . while the `` fingers of god '' are still present , the large  scale displacements are largely gone .    the essence of large ",
    "scale redshift space effects is a compression and/or expansion effect along the line of sight .",
    "it can best be explained using the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "this is now known to reproduce weakly non - linear ( i.e. large  scale ) features in the distribution of matter very accurately indeed , if implemented in an optimized form known as the truncated zeldovich approximation ( coles et al .",
    "1993 , melott 1994 ) .",
    "this approximation follows the development of structure by relating the final ( eulerian ) position of a particle @xmath14 at some time @xmath15 to its initial ( lagrangian ) position @xmath16 defined at the primordial epoch when particles were smoothly distributed : @xmath17 , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath18 describes the linear growth of perturbations as a function of cosmological proper time , @xmath15 , and @xmath19 is the cosmic scale factor ( c.f .",
    "peebles , 1980 ) . in the case of a flat universe , @xmath20 ; the behavior of @xmath21 for more general cosmologies",
    "is usually parameterized by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 can be accurately approximated as @xmath24 .    in the separable mapping ( 1 )",
    ", the displacement field is given by the gradient of the primordial gravitational potential @xmath25 with respect to the initial coordinates .",
    "differentiating the expression ( 1 ) leads to @xmath26 for the velocity of a fluid element @xmath27 .",
    "the mapping ( 2 ) provides a straightforward explanation of the changed characteristic scale of structures in the redshift direction . calculating the redshift",
    "coordinate exactly and translating it into an effective distance @xmath28 gives @xmath29 in which we have the 3-axis in the redshift direction .",
    "( note that @xmath30 , the density contrast , does not enter here . )",
    "thus the displacement term becomes multiplied by a factor @xmath31 in ( 3 ) compared to ( 2 ) .",
    "the effect of the displacement field in redshift space is to give the observer a `` preview '' ( albeit in only one direction ) of a later stage of the clustering hierarchy . in effect",
    ", the characteristic scale of structures in the z - direction should be larger than that in the directions unaffected by the extra displacements induced by redshift - space distortions .",
    "we interpret the characteristic scale as the typical distance between _ caustics _ where the mapping ( 1 ) becomes singular , which are the prominent high - density features of large - scale structure .    at first sight",
    ", this argument seems to suggest that the characteristic the characteristic spacing of high - density regions should be a factor of @xmath31 higher for the z - direction than in the orthogonal direction , i.e. a factor of two difference in a critical density universe .",
    "the real situation is , however , more complicated than that .",
    "the dominant effect of the extra displacements in ( 3 ) compared to ( 1 ) is their tendency to compress structures together , decreasing their number per unit length and increasing the typical space between them .",
    "this effect is , however , contaminated by the fingers of god , which tend to increase the apparent radial extent of high - density regions and therefore push neighboring structures together , even in low - density universes where the large - scale displacement effect is negligible .",
    "the upshot of this is that , for a critical density universe , the effect is rather less than the naive factor of two but , as we shall see , there is still a highly significant difference in characteristic spacings between low and high@xmath1 models .",
    "this effect is rather more subtle than the simple amplification of the power spectrum amplitudes one obtains by applying eulerian perturbation theory to the problem ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "the change in pattern from real to redshift space is due to phase changes associated with the extra displacements .",
    "these changes do not appear in the power spectrum ( which ignores phase information ) , but are visually clear as they result in the merging of high - density structures and a consequent increase in the spacing between them .",
    "our method has the character of a first - order statistic ( it is related to the mean spacing of objects ) rather than the usual second - order statistics ( such as the power spectrum ) , which are blind to the number - density of objects .",
    "first , we smooth the distribution in the simulations to produce a continuous density field in order to erase strongly non - linear small - scale structures .",
    "we have found empirically that smoothing by a gaussian @xmath32 where @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 gives the best results , with weak sensitivity to smoothing scale .",
    "we then construct density contours for the smoothed field , and take lines - of - sight through the smoothed density field and calculate the _ rms _ distance between successive up - crossings of the _ same _ contour level in the radial direction ; denoted @xmath36 .",
    "note that there will be one down - crossing of the same level between any two successive up - crossings .",
    "since it is our intention to capture caustics , we concentrate on high - density contours .",
    "in fact , we found that for a variety of @xmath1 and power spectral values , the most reliable approach is to choose a contour level by specifying the filling factor of regions above the contour , not an absolute @xmath30 , and that the level corresponding to a filling factor of 15% , about the peak of the spacing , is an excellent choice .",
    "we also do a similar calculation for tangential lines ( in the direction orthogonal to the observer s line of sight ) ; this is denoted @xmath37 .",
    "after much experimentation with a large ensemble of simulations , one statistic turned out to be nearly optimal : the ratio of the _ rms _ spacing in the redshift direction to that in the orthogonal direction , which we call @xmath38 : @xmath39 we verified that @xmath38 is independent of the power spectrum , and amount of nonlinearity , for a given background cosmology .",
    "we tested a total of 16 different high resolution 2d simulations ",
    "four realizations each , power law spectra @xmath40 , or constant , in both low ( 0.2 ) and high ( @xmath41 ) models .",
    "the _ rms _ spacing for an @xmath41 universe is larger in the redshift direction than in the direction orthogonal to the line of sight . as @xmath42 , the ratio decreases .    in figure 3a",
    ", we show the _ rms _ distances @xmath43 as a function of filling factor .",
    "boldface denotes those measured in the redshift direction , light the orthogonal one ; low @xmath44 is dashed , high @xmath1 has solid lines .",
    "it is clear that redshift space intervals are larger than real space ones .",
    "( we defer showing error bars to 3b , to avoid a crowded plot . )",
    "is the ratio @xmath1dependent ?",
    "we show @xmath38 in 3b , with one-@xmath45 errors in the mean obtained by averaging over all lines of sight in an ensemble of n - body simulations .",
    "these errors are typically larger than the measurement and systematic errors of the redshift .",
    "it is clear that @xmath38 is much larger in a critical density universe  at about a 4@xmath45 confidence level .",
    "we have also performed a preliminary analysis of a pair of large ( 256@xmath46 ) simulations with a cdm - type power spectrum in a low and critical  density background . in these simulations",
    "we have used the spherical symmetry that would be seen by a real observer , rather than the simplified cartesian redshift space shown in the figures for illustration . however",
    ", a full study of this type will require a variety of analyses with varying initial power spectra , amplitudes , survey geometries and magnitude limits which is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we have described a new statistic for extracting estimates of @xmath1 from redshift space distortions .",
    "we demonstrated that this method is very sensitive to the choice of @xmath1 .",
    "we have described its dynamical origin , and showed that it is qualitatively different than other related statistical methods . more detailed and systematic tests of the method are necessary , against an ensemble of simulations in a bigger variety of background cosmologies with realistic geometry and selection functions .",
    "it is appropriate here to mention that we do not expect our method to be sensitive to the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "however , an extension of the method may just make it possible to measure @xmath47 .",
    "our method has picked out the radial anisotropy due to redshift distortion , which could not be picked out with high significance by examining the orientation of voids in redshift space diagrams ( ryden and melott 1996 ) . in extremely deep redshift surveys ,",
    "variation of @xmath38 with redshift may provide an independent estimate of @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath38 is the ratio of a displacement to a displacement .",
    "unlike the usual methods , we do not relate displacement ( or velocity ) to @xmath30 , which is the origin of bias  dependence ( e.g. hamilton 1998 ,  4.1 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the relatively weak dependence of @xmath38 on the filling factor chosen to select contours in our method .",
    "dynamically - produced voids resemble flat - bottomed valleys surrounded by steep mountains .",
    "a local bias has the effect of moving the contour level up the mountains , but will not lead to a large increase in the typical size of the valleys unless the contour level changes so much that the filling factor is reduced by a large factor . since a large bias does not seem to be allowed by standard theories of structure formation , we do not expect bias to affect @xmath38 significantly in realistic situations .",
    "these considerations lead us to conclude that our technique is expected to be significantly less sensitive to the presence of a bias @xmath48 than the standard methods .",
    "the main effect would be that we would choose too large a value of the smoothing length ( for @xmath49 ) for the actual state of dynamical evolution of the distribution .",
    "we have already found experimentally that this has a much weaker effect than @xmath48 has in the usual second - order methods , such as the power spectrum and correlation function .    of course , it remains possible that some extreme form of bias might occur which does affect the reliability of our method .",
    "for example , it is clear that a galaxy distribution that was simply `` painted '' onto a uniform high - density background ( e.g. bower et al . 1993 ) with no dynamical tracer of its origin , would fool our method ( as it would the standard tools ) . if the bias were linear but so large that it completely swamped the effects of dynamical evolution we would also expect to have problems : the mean spacing of high - density regions in such models could be much larger than any scale associated with dynamics and @xmath38 might well turn out to be very close to unity even if @xmath50 .",
    "we are not claiming , therefore , that our method is completely independent of all possible forms of biasing , but we are confident that a modest amount of linear bias does not have the same adverse effect on our technique as it does on standard methods .",
    "we are currently using larger three - dimensional numerical simulations to explore this effect in detail .",
    "a different and probably more significant limitation of our approach is that it will require a catalog with a relatively high number - density of galaxies so that excessive smoothing is not required . the sampling rate of the las campanas survey ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) may be adequate for this purpose , but the method is ideally suited to upcoming very large surveys , particularly the anglo - australian 2df and sloan digital sky survey .",
