    "holographic qcd offers new approaches to understand the strongly interacting regime of gauge theories based on ads / cft duality @xcite .",
    "the properties of qcd including confinement and chiral symmetry breaking have been discussed in asymptotically ads geometries @xcite .    the gravity dual of qcd can be derived in both top - down and bottom - up approaches .",
    "there are two methods to construct ads / qcd background in the bottom - up approach .",
    "one is introducing an infrared ( ir ) cutoff @xcite , and the other is scaling the action or modifying the background metric by introducing a scalar field or a warp factor so that a smooth ir truncation is induced @xcite .",
    "the light - front holography @xcite is constructed by using the both methods .",
    "the phase transition between the confining and deconfining phases corresponds to the hawking - page transition @xcite of gravity between thermal ads ( tads ) at low temperature and the schwarzschild ads black hole at high temperature in pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the phase transition of holographic qcd in the hard wall @xcite and soft wall model @xcite was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the holographic qcd can be improved by including the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the charge of reissner - nordstrm ads black hole ( rnads bh ) can be interpreted as quark charge when branes fill the bulk @xcite .",
    "the boundary value of the time - component gauge field is the chemical potential whose dual operator is the quark number density .",
    "the gravity dual to deconfining phase of qcd is the rnads bh . the thermal charged ads ( tcads ) space , which is the zero mass limit of the rnads bh , was proposed as the dual geometry corresponding to the confining phase of qcd @xcite .",

    "it has been also observed that meson mass increases as the quark density increases in the hard wall model @xcite .    in this report",

    "we consider the holographic qcd in the hadronic ( or quark ) medium using the soft wall model .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the quark number operator in the gauge theory side corresponds to the time - component of the bulk gauge field .",
    "so the dual geometry of the hadronic medium should be a five - dimensional spacetime containing some electric charges .",
    "there are well - known examples describing the asymptotic ads space containing the electric charges .",
    "one is the reissner - nordstrm ads black hole ( rnads bh ) corresponding to the deconfining phase described by quarks and gluons in the gauge theory side .",

    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the on - shell gravity action corresponds to the thermodynamic energy of the dual gauge theory , so we evaluate the on - shell gravity action on and with the gauge field .    for the deconfining phase , which is dual to the rnads bh , we impose the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath14 at the boundary @xmath15 to get the corresponding on - shell gravity action @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the volume of the three - dimensional space , the uv cut - off and the inverse hawking temperature @xmath20 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this on - shell gravity action is proportional to the grand potential of the dual gauge theory , which is a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the black hole charge should therefore be a function of the chemical potential @xmath8 . to determine this relation , we impose the regularity condition , @xmath21 , at the black hole horizon .",
