    "a jet is a collimated spray of particles that is produced in the process of parton showering when a highly virtual parton fragments .",
    "since it is ambiguous to associate final state hadrons with initial partons , the assignment of hadrons to jets is based on the decision of reconstruction algorithm .",
    "jet reconstruction algorithms are designed to recover the four - momentum of the initial parton by summing up momenta of particles in the final state . in order to have a clear correspondence between jets in theory and experiment , jet algorithms have to be infrared and collinear safe @xcite .",
    "jets have several useful properties which predestine them as a convenient probe to study the medium created in a collision of two relativistic nuclei .",
    "first of all , we have a good understanding of jet production on perturbative qcd level in elementary reactions .",
    "further , it is known that processes with large four - momentum transfer @xmath10 occur in the initial stage of the nucleus - nucleus collision before the quark gluon plasma is formed .",
    "hard - scattered partons then interact with the medium of deconfined quarks and gluons and loose energy .",
    "this is manifested by the so - called jet quenching phenomenon when a jet pair with a high transverse momentum imbalance is observed @xcite . the principal goal why the jet - medium interaction is studied is to understand the nature of medium - induced parton energy loss mechanism and its possible connection to the strongly coupled limit of qcd .",
    "a detailed description of the alice detector can be found in @xcite . here",
    "let us just briefly mention that precise tracking is provided by a six - layered silicon vertex tracker in combination with a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "both detectors are placed in the core of alice central barrel where the solenoidal magnetic field reaches 0.5  t. alice has nearly uniform acceptance and efficiency coverage for tracks in the pseudorapidity range @xmath11 in the full azimuth throughout a wide transverse momentum range from @xmath12  mev/@xmath13 to @xmath14  gev/@xmath13 .",
    "alice has also partial coverage by the electromagnetic calorimeter emcal which covers @xmath15  deg in azimuth and @xmath16 in pseudorapidity .",
    "jets are reconstructed either from tracks only ( _ charged jets _ ) or by combining tracks and calorimeter clusters ( _ full jets _ ) . whereas charged jets can be reconstructed in the full azimuth , acceptance of full jets is restricted by the incomplete coverage of the electromagnetic calorimeter . in order to remove partially reconstructed jets that appear at the boarder of the alice acceptance",
    ", the jet pseudorapidity range is limited by means of a fiducial cut , namely for charged jets we use @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the resolution parameter of the given jet algorithm .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the infrared and collinear safe anti-@xmath8 and @xmath8 algorithms @xcite .",
    "soft bulk hadrons created in a heavy - ion collision constitute a significant background for jet reconstruction and cause a shift in the jet energy scale .",
    "the transverse momentum of reconstructed jets @xmath19 is therefore corrected for the average contribution of the bulk hadrons using the formula @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes jet area and @xmath22 is the mean background density .",
    "the mean background density is estimated on an event - by - event basis employing the standard area based method @xcite .",
    "the finite width of the jet energy resolution is given by two sources .",
    "the first source of jet energy smearing are the local background fluctuations that occur in each event .",
    "the second contributor to the jet energy resolution are detector effects .",
    "the response matrix that relates the @xmath4 of reconstructed and true jets is assumed to factorize into a product of matrices that describe momentum smearing by local background fluctuations and momentum smearing by detector effects .",
    "the matrix is inverted by means of common regularized unfolding techniques based on the svd decomposition @xcite or bayes theorem @xcite implemented in the roounfold package @xcite .",
    "data on hadron composition of jets provides an important benchmark for the theory and is also needed for the fine tuning of the commonly used event generators such as pythia @xcite .",
    "alice has measured the inclusive @xmath4 spectra of hadrons in charged jets in pp collisions at @xmath0  tev @xcite . to extract the yields of identified particles in a given track @xmath4 bin , we use the ionization energy loss @xmath23 measured by the alice tpc .",
    "the fractions of the most abundant particle species , which are @xmath24 , k , p and e , are extracted using two methods .",
    "the first one parameterizes the @xmath23 distribution corresponding to individual particle species in a given track @xmath4 bin with gaussian functions that have the width and mean constrained by an analytic model @xcite .",

    "note that such condition makes the selected sample of jets more biased as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "@xmath37 reconstruction was based on charged decay channels @xmath39 and @xmath40 and employed topological cuts . as the decay daughters of @xmath37 particles are secondary tracks they were excluded from the jet reconstruction procedure . the decision to associate @xmath5 or @xmath30 candidate with a given jet",
    "was done based on their mutual angular distance , @xmath41 here @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) denote the azimuthal angle ( pseudorapidity ) distance between the @xmath37 candidate momentum and the jet axis and @xmath18 is the jet resolution parameter .",
    "the extracted yield of @xmath37 candidates in jets was corrected for the expected contribution of @xmath37 from the underlying event and for the reconstruction efficiency .",
    "in addition , the yield of @xmath5 particles was corrected for a contribution coming from the feed down of @xmath44 cascades .",

    "in both systems , the ratio measured in jets is significantly lower than the inclusive one .",
    "this observation thus supports the picture that fragmentation of hard partons producing charged jets with @xmath46  gev/@xmath13 does not contribute to the observed baryon anomaly .",
    "a similar conclusion was reported also earlier for @xmath47 ratio using two particle correlations @xcite .",
    "the source of the baryon anomaly thus seems to be intimately connected with partons having smaller transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity of hadrons in a central heavy - ion collision is large .",
    "in such an environment , the jet reconstruction algorithm often clusters together just soft bulk particles . as a result",
    "an artificial jet is created .",
    "one possibility how to suppress the number of these artificial jets is to require that the reconstructed jet contains at least one constituent with @xmath4 above some preset threshold .",
    "this condition , however , imposes a bias on the jet fragmentation which can be unwanted especially in the situation when we look for quenched jets .",
    "hadron - jet coincidence measurements offer an elegant way how to overcome this problem . the approach which we will discuss allows to remove the contribution of combinatorial background jets including multi - parton interaction without imposing fragmentation bias on the reconstructed jet .",
    "the method is data driven and can be used also for jets with large @xmath18 and low @xmath4 .",
    "the detailed description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the basic steps of the analysis can be summarized as follows .",
    "we select events that contain a high-@xmath4 hadron ( trigger track ) .",
    "the presence of a high-@xmath4 hadron identifies collisions where a hard scattering occurred . in these events ,",
    "we analyze jets that recoil nearly back to back in azimuth w.r.t . to the trigger track ; e.g. , in this analysis , it was requested that the opening angle between the trigger track and the recoiling jet is larger than @xmath48  rad in azimuth .",
    "figure  [ fighj1 ] shows a comparison of two per trigger normalized background density corrected semi - inclusive @xmath4 distributions of recoil jets associated to exclusive trigger @xmath4 bins , @xmath49  gev/@xmath13 and @xmath50  gev/@xmath13 . for brevity from now on @xmath51",
    "will be labeled as tt . in general , a trigger track with larger @xmath4 comes on average from a hard scattering process with larger @xmath10 , therefore also the corresponding recoil jet @xmath4 spectrum is harder . nevertheless , in the region where the mean background density corrected jet @xmath4 is around or below zero , both spectra turn out to be nearly identical .",
    "this part of the distribution is dominated by accidental combinations of the trigger track with uncorrelated combinatorial background jets .",

    "the contribution of combinatorial background jets is removed .",
    "further , let us point out that @xmath52 has a direct link to theory , since the per trigger yield of recoil jets can be expressed in terms of the cross - section to produce a high-@xmath55 hadron and the cross section to produce a high-@xmath55 hadron together with a jet , i.e. , @xmath56    the requirement to have a high-@xmath4 trigger in event introduces also some interesting biases on the selected sample of events and recoil jets",
    ". e.g. , the parton that produces the trigger particle is more biased to be close to the surface of the collision zone @xcite , therefore the recoiling jet will have on average longer path length through the medium .",
