    "the discovery that black holes have an associated entropy given by the bekenstein formula @xmath0 in terms of the horizon area @xmath1 is arguably a very important clue to the understanding of the role of gravity at the quantum level .",
    "current explanations of the black hole entropy vary between the use of definite models for quantum gravity , and effective ideas as entanglement entropy and induced gravity ( for a general review and references see @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the black hole entropy increases proportionally to the area in planck units rather than the volume , has led to the idea of the holographic or spherical entropy bound @xcite .",
    "this states that the entropy for a system enclosed in a given approximately spherical surface of area @xmath1 is less than @xmath2 .",
    "the spherical bound can be seen as a statement on the metastability of macroscopic black holes , that is , that no system enclosed inside a spherical area @xmath1 can have greater entropy than a black hole of the same area @xcite .",
    "however , the bound does not work for irregular surfaces , surfaces inside black holes or in cosmological situations , where there is a strong time dependence of the matter system compared with its typical radius ( see for details @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "an appropriate generalized version of this bound to cosmological situations and general space - times was developed by bousso in @xcite , where it was called the covariant entropy bound .",
    "here we briefly introduce it , for a detailed account see @xcite .",
    "given a spatial codimension two surface @xmath3 it is possible to construct four congruences of null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath3 , two past and two future directed .",
    "suppose that one of these null congruences orthogonal to @xmath4 has non positive expansion @xmath5 at @xmath3 .",
    "then call @xmath6 the subset of the hypersurface generated by the congruence where the expansion is non positive .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath6 is called a light - sheet of @xmath3 .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows an example .",
    "the covariant entropy bound states that the entropy in @xmath6 is less than @xmath7 .",
    "the covariant bound should be regarded as tentative . however , there are no known reasonable counterexamples .",
    "indeed , the bound can be shown to be true in the classical regime under certain conditions equivalent to a local cutoff in energy , and when the metric satisfies the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this includes a vast set of physical situations .    under the conditions of the covariant entropy bound , the naive picture coming from hyperbolic equations of motion and the cauchy surfaces in space - time results drastically changed .",
    "in the usual picture the dataset on the cauchy surface is to be taken as arbitrary , giving place to an independent degree of freedom for planck volume and a maximum number of states of the order of the exponential of the volume in the cutoff units .",
    "the existence of covariant laws of evolution imposes that the physics inside the whole causal development of the surface @xmath8 in fig .",
    "1(a ) should be described in terms of the same degrees of freedom . however , the entropy bound imply that the maximum number of states is further reduced to be some exponential of the area of the surface @xmath9 .",
    "the idea that the physics inside a given volume ( and then in the whole diamond shaped region @xmath10 of fig .",
    "1(a ) ) would admit a description in terms of independent degrees of freedom at the bounding surface is known as the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "this reduction would not apply in this simple form when the surface @xmath9 is trapped or antitrapped , that is , when the two null congruences orthogonal to @xmath11 having negative expansion are both future or past directed ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . there , the bound is saved by the choosing of negative expansion light - sheets and the formation of a singularity in space - time .    in a quantum field theory",
    "the reeh - schlieder theorem @xcite impedes the discussion of the physics in a finite region in terms of subspaces of whole the hilbert space , because the fields restricted to a bounded region generate the whole hilbert space when acting on the vacuum  .",
    "however , local algebras of operators can be defined .",
    "the diamond shaped sets of fig .",
    "1(a ) play an important role in the algebraic approach to quantum field theory @xcite . in this context , to some sets @xmath10 in space - time it is associated an algebra @xmath12 of bounded operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath13 , ( in fact a von neumann algebra ) .",
    "these have to be regarded as the algebras generated by the quantum fields averaged using weight functions with support inside the given region ( see @xcite for the relation with conventional quantum field theory ) .",
    "the operator algebras are local , in the sense that given two sets @xmath10 , and @xmath14 @xmath15 in addition , the operators on the algebra corresponding to the causal complement @xmath16 of @xmath10 , @xmath17 , commute with the operators in @xmath18 . here",
    "the causal complement or opposite @xmath16 of @xmath10 is the set of points spatially separated from @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the algebra of the operators that commute with all the operators in @xmath21 .",
    "the conditions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) are minimal for the net of algebras , and some evolution law has to be supplemented . in minkowski space",
    "the evolution is dictated by the existence of a unitary representation of the poincare group acting on the local algebras . for a more general situation",
    "the dynamical law would be manifest in that for a set @xmath10 @xcite @xmath22 then , a natural definition of the diamond shaped sets in this context , is the sets that satisfy @xmath23 .",
    "these are called causally closed sets .",
    "for example , the diamond shaped set @xmath10 in fig .",
    "1(a ) is the domain of dependence @xmath24 of the surface @xmath8 , that is , the maximal set where it is possible to determine the variables for a wave - like theory with the knowledge of the initial data on @xmath8 .",
    "it is also @xmath25 , thus @xmath10 is causally closed .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the causal closure of an achronal set includes its domain of dependence , and in a globally hyperbolic space - time the domain of dependence and the causal closure coincide for achronal sets bounded in time .",
    "therefore , eq.([c ] ) applied to a set @xmath10 covering a piece of a space - like surface @xmath8 implies that the algebra corresponding to @xmath10 includes the algebra corresponding to the domain of dependence of @xmath8 , as expected from a theory with hyperbolic equations of motion .",
    "however , eq . ( [ c ] ) is in general stronger than what can be induced by causal propagation ( see section iii below ) .",
    "we will postpone to section iii and iv the discussion of the relation between causally closed sets and the light - sheets generated by spatial codimension 2 surfaces . in this work",
    "the main discussion is centered in the geometry of the nets of causal diamond shaped sets , while its relation with the local algebras and the counting of degrees of freedom will be heuristic .",
    "we argue that under some physical conditions the net of sets to which are assigned the local operator algebras have to be taken non orthomodular .",
    "we show that this simple geometry can be associated with a possible origin of the holographic property in an effective quantum field theory description .",
    "we construct a net of causal sets that implements the cutoff in a covariant way and lead to an explanation of the non positive expansion light - sheet selection in the covariant entropy bound .",
    "in this section we introduce several lattices of causal space - time subsets and briefly investigate their properties .",
    "a more extensive analysis for the orthomodular case can be consulted in @xcite . given a globally hyperbolic space - time @xmath26 and a set @xmath10 in @xmath26 we call its causal opposite or orthocomplement @xmath27 to the set where the local operators in a given quantum theory are constrained to commute with the local operators in @xmath10 .",
    "we explore several possibilities for the operation of causal opposite and its consequences for the lattices of the `` diamond shaped '' ( causally closed ) sets .",
    "these sets are the ones that satisfy @xmath23 , and thus its definition is tied to the opposite operation .",
    "we start with a definition for @xmath28 as the set of all points @xmath29 such that there is no time - like curve connecting @xmath30 with a point in @xmath10 .",
    "thus , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the chronological future and past of @xmath10 , that is , the set of points that can be reached by future directed ( past directed ) time - like curves starting at a point in @xmath10 .",
    "we call @xmath34 to the set of causally closed sets @xmath10 , @xmath35 , where the opposite operation is given in equation ( [ op ] ) .",
    "let us look more closely to the properties of @xmath34 . the empty set @xmath36 and @xmath26 belong to @xmath34 and are mutually complementary .",
    "it is easy to show that it is @xmath37 and then @xmath28 is an element of @xmath38 for any set @xmath10 .",
    "the operation of taking the causal opposite is internal in @xmath38 .",
    "we also have the order relation given by the set inclusion @xmath39 .",
    "we can define two additional binary internal operations in @xmath34 , the meet @xmath40 and the join @xmath41 , given by @xmath42    the set @xmath34 with the order relation @xmath39 and the operations @xmath43 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , forms what is called an orthocomplemented lattice @xcite ( see @xcite for the mathematical context ) .",
    "a lattice @xmath44 is an ordered set under some order relation @xmath45 , where the greatest lower bound and the lowest upper bound of two elements @xmath1 and @xmath46 with respect to this order relation always exist , and are represented by the operations @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "an orthocomplemented lattice has in addition a unary operation @xmath49 called opposite or orthocomplement , such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is maximal element of the lattice ( it is @xmath26 for @xmath38 ) .    as a more familiar example of an orthocomplemented lattice we have the set @xmath52 of all subsets of a given set @xmath53 .",
    "there , the order relation is again given by the inclusion @xmath39 , while the other operations are the set complement @xmath54 , intersection @xmath55 , and union @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the properties of the operations in @xmath34 that come from the orthocomplemented lattice structure copy those of @xmath52 .",
    "for example , the operations @xmath40 and @xmath41 are associative and symmetric . the duality relations also hold in any orthocomplemented lattice , @xmath57    however , while the operations @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are distributive in @xmath58 , the operations @xmath40 and @xmath41 are not distributive in @xmath59 .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the set of all closed vector subspaces of a hilbert space , @xmath60 .",
    "the set @xmath61 forms an orthocomplemented lattice under the order given by @xmath39 , the opposite of a subspace @xmath62 given by the orthogonal space @xmath63 , and the meet and join given by the intersection @xmath55 , and sum @xmath64 of vector spaces respectively .",
    "the sum and intersection do not distribute as can be checked with the vector spaces generated by three independent vectors .",
    "however , a weaker form of distributivity holds in @xmath60 called orthomodularity , that is a central property in the studies of quantum logic @xcite .",
    "= 13.5 cm    it was shown in @xcite for minkowski space , and for general space - times ( without imposing any causality condition ) in @xcite that the set @xmath34 with the order relation @xmath45 and the operations @xmath54 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 defined above is an orthocomplemented orthomodular ( and non distributive ) lattice ( see fig .",
    "2(a - b ) ) .",
    "the orthomodularity condition is that for any @xmath1 and @xmath46 in the lattice @xmath67    in quantum mechanics the lattice of closed vector subspaces of the hilbert space has a logical interpretation in terms of physical propositions , and the orthomodular property is inherent to this logic structure @xcite .",
    "the proposition corresponding to a subspace @xmath62 on a vector state @xmath68 is given by `` the orthogonal projection of @xmath68 onto @xmath62 is @xmath68 '' .",
    "thus the answer is yes if the state vector belongs to @xmath62 and no if @xmath68 belongs to the orthogonal space to @xmath62 .",
    "the lattice of causally closed sets @xmath34 have a logical interpretation in terms of physical propositions given by space - time subsets @xcite .",
    "the proposition corresponding to a set @xmath10 about a point like particle is given by `` the particle passes through @xmath10 '' , while the negation of that proposition is given by `` the particle passes through @xmath16 '' .",
    "the prescription @xmath23 is related with the logical axiom that states that the opposite of the opposite of a proposition gives again the same proposition .",
    "it is necessary to restrict to the causally closed sets in order to have a logic in terms of space - time sets , since for different types of sets the opposite of the corresponding proposition is a statement about particle trajectories that can not be put as a subset proposition of the above kind .    before showing the meaning of orthomodularity in the present context we will construct a different orthocomplemented lattice of causal sets that does not have this property .    in the literature the operator algebras",
    "are usually associated with open sets , because they are thought as coming from smoothed quantum fields .",
    "it has also been suggested that the corresponding net of subsets of space - time is orthomodular @xcite .",
    "the lattice @xmath34 is orthomodular , but it is not formed by open sets .",
    "we will see that one can not have both things together .",
    "there is another unsatisfactory feature of @xmath34 in this context , the fact that there are orthogonal sets that can be joined by a null geodesic ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . here",
    "we use the term orthogonal borrowed from the lattice of closed subspaces of the hilbert space @xmath60 when referring to two sets @xmath69 , @xmath70 , such that @xmath69 @xmath71 .",
    "thus , as information can be passed from one set to the other the operators based on them should not necessarily commute . to take into account the propagation of massless fields",
    "one would then replace the definition of the opposite ( [ op ] ) by @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the causal future and past of @xmath10 , that is , the set of points that can be reached from @xmath10 by future directed ( past directed ) time - like or null curves .",
    "again an orthocomplemented lattice @xmath75 is obtained picking up the causally complete sets @xmath76 , where the opposite operation is given by equation ( [ equu ] ) , and the meet and join by eqs .",
    "( [ meet ] ) and ( [ join ] ) @xcite .",
    "now the light rays coming from @xmath10 do not intersect @xmath28 .",
    "however not all sets in @xmath75 are open .",
    "we can construct another lattice of causally closed sets where opposite sets are not causally connected , but now formed by open sets , using the opposite given by @xmath77 and where @xmath78 means the topological closure of @xmath1 . we will call @xmath79 to the lattice of open sets that are causally closed with respect to the opposite operation ( [ hs ] ) . as was shown in @xcite",
    ", @xmath80 is also an orthocomplemented lattice . both lattices @xmath79 and @xmath75",
    "behave very similarly , except that @xmath81 is formed by open sets and do not contain lower dimensional objects .",
    "furthermore , in a discretized version of space - time they would coincide as explained below .    however , the lattices @xmath82 and @xmath75 , in contrast to @xmath83 , are not orthomodular .",
    "this is shown in the example of figure 2(c ) . as explained in @xcite",
    "the orthocomplemented structure follows naturally from the existence of an orthogonality relation between points in space - time , but the strongest requirement of orthomodularity seems to require the exact definition ( [ op ] ) for the opposite .",
    "there are two equivalent conditions to orthomodularity for an arbitrary orthocomplemented lattice @xmath44 that we will now illustrate .",
    "the first is a kind of good property under reduction to a subspace .",
    "the lattice @xmath84 is orthomodular if and only if for any @xmath85 the family @xmath86 , formed by the sets @xmath87 , @xmath88 , is again an orthocomplemented lattice , where the opposite operation restricted to @xmath89 is @xmath90 .",
    "then it follows that the lattice @xmath89 is also orthomodular . that this condition is true for @xmath91 and false for @xmath79",
    "is exemplified in fig .",
    "3 . what this is telling is the following .",
    "an element @xmath1 in @xmath92 is not a submanifold of @xmath26 because it is not an open set , but the elements of @xmath34 inside @xmath1 form a good orthomodular lattice with respect to the induced operations in @xmath1 . on the contrary ,",
    "an element @xmath1 in @xmath79 is a submanifold of @xmath26 because it is open , but the elements of @xmath93 inside @xmath1 are not in general elements of the lattice induced by the reduced notion of causality @xmath94 .",
    "the sets in @xmath82 included in @xmath1 that do not belong to @xmath95 share a piece of its null border with the null border of @xmath1 , that is , they are in contact with @xmath1 from inside .",
    "in fact , a weaker form of orthomodularity for @xmath96 holds , that reads @xmath97 where @xmath1 and @xmath46 belong to @xmath79 .",
    "the condition @xmath98 is sufficient for @xmath99 , but is not necessary since the examples suggest that whenever @xmath46 share a piece of the spatial corner with @xmath1 it is @xmath99 .",
    "this has a resemblance with what happens in the exterior of a black hole or in the rindler wedge in minkowski space where the observers can restrict themselves to living in a submanifold , but at the cost of dealing with a non pure state",
    ". here , as we reduce to a submanifold @xmath1 there are sets @xmath46 of @xmath26 included in @xmath1 that would have associated an algebra of local operators @xmath100 .",
    "however , @xmath101 does not exist in the theory restricted to @xmath1 for some of the @xmath88 .",
    "thus , some local operators in @xmath1 would be missing from the set of operators available to the observer .",
    "somehow the lattice @xmath79 would have information about the entanglement of fluctuations in the vacuum across causal horizons as implied by the reeh - schlieder theorem .",
    "the second condition equivalent to orthomodularity is that for any set @xmath10 in an orthocomplemented lattice @xmath44 there must not exist a set @xmath14 in @xmath44 with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and such that @xmath104 .",
    "that is , the complement of @xmath28 is unique among the sets included in @xmath10 .",
    "this condition is respected in @xmath34 while it does not hold in @xmath105 .",
    "more generally , given two orthogonal sets @xmath1 and @xmath46 , and @xmath106 , @xmath107 , in an orthomodular lattice it can not be that @xmath108 . however , this is true for certain sets in @xmath109 , what could have very interesting consequences as we will see in the next section ( see fig .",
    "5(b ) ) .",
    "as the difference between the lattices presented so far is somewhat a subtlety related to the borders of the sets , one could wonder if a slight modification of the definitions would not yield a lattice of open sets orthomodular .",
    "this is not possible if one wants to retain the algebraic properties of the lattice and where the opposite consists of points spatially separated .",
    "for example a tentative possibility would be to identify the operations in @xmath79 with operations in @xmath110 assigning to the set @xmath10 in @xmath111 the set @xmath112 in @xmath34 .",
    "however this fails because a piece of a null surface is an element in @xmath113 without interior , and its existence is crucial for orthomodularity ( see fig .",
    "adding null surfaces to @xmath105 will lead to @xmath34 , that has orthogonal elements causally connected , or to @xmath114 , that is again non orthomodular .",
    "a more convincing argument in favor of a non orthomodular lattice comes in a context where there is a cutoff .",
    "for example , take a discretized version of space - time choosing points at random with constant medium density with respect to the volume form , and dropping the rest of the space - time @xcite .",
    "there the lattices we introduced will basically coincide , because the differences appear only when there are points lying in the same null geodesic , an event of zero probability .",
    "call the resulting lattice @xmath115 . also , even if it happens that two points are light connected , in any discretized version , the fact that their operators should not commute , and the points should not be orthogonal becomes strengthened in comparison with the continuum .",
    "thus , it seems that when space - time itself is blurred at some scale ( but retaining a causal relation as in @xcite ) , extremely localized objects as the border of sets would have no meaning .",
    "the causal structure would survive at large scales through a non orthomodular causal net .",
    "we will not study here the interesting problem of finding the lattice operations of this type of discretized space - time in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "we only note that for simple examples of @xmath115 constructed with a few points , the result is somewhat intermediate between the behavior of @xmath116 and @xmath34 ( see figure 4 ) , a feature that we will encounter again in section iv for a different type of regularized lattice that we now introduce .",
    "we mentioned that for a theory of point particles , or more generally any theory that allows to probe the space - time structure up to the continuum , the lattice @xmath34 has an interpretation in terms of physical propositions given by space - time subsets .",
    "however , if there is a lowest scale that can be tested then the situation is different .",
    "suppose that we can probe the space - time up to a minimal size @xmath117 .",
    "we can think that our probe is an extended particle of rest frame size @xmath117 .",
    "then , given a set @xmath10 we can probe that a point is spatially separated from @xmath10 only if it is separated from @xmath10 by a spatial distance greater than @xmath117 .",
    "equivalently , two points will be causally unrelated if any of the extended particle trajectories passing over one point does not reach the other .",
    "thus we define the opposite operation by @xmath118 where we use the signature @xmath119 for the metric and @xmath120 is the greatest square geodesic distance between @xmath30 and @xmath121 ( in case @xmath30 and @xmath121 can not be joined by any geodesic set @xmath122 ) .",
    "the use of @xmath123 or @xmath124 in ( [ muop ] ) is not relevant in what follows .",
    "a structure of orthocomplemented lattice is obtained for the causally closed sets from this definition for the opposite and we call the resulting lattice @xmath125 .",
    "we have that @xmath125 is a non orthomodular lattice , while the lattices produced by choosing a positive value instead of @xmath126 in ( [ muop ] ) behave as orthomodular for simple examples .",
    "the non orthomodularity of @xmath125 is in accord with the known result that given a orthocomplemented structure the orthomodularity is related with the presence of a set of states that is enough to separate the different propositions @xcite .    with the interpretation of the opposite of a set @xmath10 as the set of points where the operators commute with those based on @xmath10 we arrive at the same operation ( [ muop ] ) in the case where there is a lowest fundamental scale .",
    "operators algebras based on regions separated by a spatial distance smaller than @xmath117 may not commute because that would imply that a smaller scale have an observational significance . only a finite number of mutually orthogonal sets are included in a given bounded diamond in the lattice @xmath125 , so the net can be thought as a covariant way of implementing a cutoff because independent degrees of freedom based on different space - time sets should have commuting generators .",
    "the causal closure ( the double opposite ) in @xmath34 for an achronal bounded set has also the interpretation of being its causal domain of dependence .",
    "a similar interpretation has the closure in @xmath127 .",
    "given an orthogonal set of points @xmath8 in this lattice we can draw a cauchy surface @xmath128 passing through all of them . then given a point @xmath30 in the generated set @xmath129 and any extended particle trajectory that passes over @xmath30 , the trajectories cut @xmath128 at points which have a spatial distance from @xmath8 smaller that @xmath117 .",
    "thus , @xmath8 acts as a generalized form of cauchy surface for @xmath129 .",
    "thus , it seems that the presence of a cutoff in the space - time description leads to a non orthomodular lattice for the causally closed sets that implement the causal law ( [ c ] ) . here",
    "the causal closure has to be calculated with the opposite ( [ muop ] ) .    from their definitions we see that @xmath34 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 do not change with conformal transformations , and thus , they are a property of the conformal structure . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath133 are not conformally invariant .",
    "we will assume that we can construct the algebra @xmath18 corresponding to a set @xmath10 formed by set union of orthogonal sets @xmath134 with the elements of the corresponding algebras .",
    "thus @xmath135 where the sets @xmath134 are orthogonal , and @xmath136 denotes the algebra generated by @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "this is a natural postulate that involves a local principle .",
    "the operators associated to a set of space - like separated regions can be constructed with operators based on the given regions .",
    "however , eq.([d ] ) can have problems in theories with global non gauge charges ( see @xcite , specially section iii.4 ) .",
    "remarkably , these charges are not supposed to survive at a fundamental level or when all effective terms in the lagrangian are taken into account .    from eqs .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) it follows that @xmath139 for orthogonal families @xmath140 of elements .",
    "here we note that we used eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) only for the union of orthogonal families of causally closed sets . otherwise this equation can not be justified on the basis of causal propagation only .",
    "for example the double opposite of a set @xmath10 formed by two time - like displaced diamonds is a set bigger than the domain of dependence of @xmath10 , that is , the set of all points through which every inextendible time - like curve intersects @xmath10",
    ".    equation ( [ law ] ) is the statement that the local operators acting in a region of space - time can be constructed from the mutually commuting sets of operators in regions non causally connected to each other .",
    "the content of this equation clearly depends on the lattice chosen for the causally closed sets .",
    "it expresses in algebraic manner the causality of dynamical evolution due to classical space - time geometry when using the lattice @xmath34 , and it is a natural generalization for the case where the causal structure is only described by a lattice .",
    "we will proceed assuming that ( [ law ] ) is valid and show that it has strong implications for a non orthomodular lattice .",
    "now we see the role of the lattice of causally closed sets that is used as the base for the theory . in the case of @xmath34 ,",
    "the picture is that of hyperbolic dynamical laws with the initial data set on cauchy surfaces .",
    "in fact , given a diamond @xmath10 in @xmath34 if we try to form it as a join of mutually orthogonal smaller diamonds , we find that these later always cover a cauchy surface for @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "thus @xmath141 can be seen as formed by mutually commuting generators on the cauchy surface .",
    "the lattice @xmath79 implies a very different counting of degrees of freedom .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "5(b ) , there each diamond is generated by a subset arbitrarily close to the spatial border of @xmath10 , plus an arbitrarily small orthogonal diamond near one of the tips .",
    "thus , most of the independent degrees of freedom are localized in the surface @xmath3 . when there is a cutoff the number of degrees of freedom would increase as the bounding area .",
    "the role of the non orthomodular behavior is clear . in figure 5(b ) it is @xmath142 , where @xmath8 is a proper subset of @xmath46 .",
    "as already mentioned this situation can not happen in an orthomodular lattice .",
    "a similar construction may be implemented for a null hypersurface converging to a point @xmath143 , and orthogonal to a non necessarily closed codimension 2 spatial surface @xmath3 . there",
    ", a neighborhood of the null hypersurface can be formed as the join of a small set near @xmath3 and a small orthogonal diamond near @xmath143 .",
    "thus , it seems that a non orthomodular causal net captures the features of the holographic property .",
    "however , the lattice @xmath144 has two drawbacks .",
    "one is that it does not tell how to count degrees of freedom , as an arbitrarily small set in the lattice includes infinitely many orthogonal subsets .",
    "the other is that it is conformally invariant .",
    "then , the lattice makes no difference between expanding and contracting null hypersurfaces orthogonal to @xmath3 if they finally converge to a point .",
    "so , the same argument that applies for the surface @xmath6 in the case of fig .",
    "1(a ) would apply for the dashed line representing a null hypersurface in fig .",
    "1(b ) , leading to entropy bounds with simple counterexamples ( for example if the universe if big enough beyond the hubble radius as suggested by inflation ) .",
    "these difficulties can be cured using @xmath145 that implements a finite cutoff .",
    "we can give a measure of a set @xmath10 in this lattice that would correspond to the number of degrees of freedom available inside @xmath10 .",
    "first , we want the independent degrees of freedom to be assigned to orthogonal sets .",
    "second , if a set contains a pair of orthogonal subsets it can not be assigned just one degree of freedom .",
    "thus we can think in the sets that do not contain any pair of orthogonal subsets as the building blocks .",
    "for definiteness we will take the points , that do not have any proper subsets , as such building blocks .",
    "these are the atoms of the lattice .",
    "the minimal number @xmath146 of orthogonal points we need to generate @xmath10 ( or a set that covers @xmath10 in general ) is then naturally associated with some constant times the number of degrees of freedom in @xmath10 .",
    "this definition is covariant .    as an example consider three dimensional minkowski space , and the diamond set @xmath10 in fig .",
    "it is possible to construct the net of orthogonal points that cover the cauchy surface @xmath8 as in fig .",
    "it also generates its domain of dependence @xmath10 .",
    "the number of points then grows with the volume of the cauchy surface . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , with points near the bounding area @xmath3 plus one single orthogonal point one can also generate a set covering @xmath10 .",
    "the number of points is smaller than in the previous case , thus it represents the actual number ( or a greater bound ) of degrees of freedom .",
    "the reason for the holographic reduction of the number of independent degrees of freedom can be seen more easily looking at fig.(7 ) .",
    "suppose we have a covariant way of assigning degrees of freedom to the cauchy surfaces @xmath128 and @xmath147 , for example by separating them by some spatial distance as we have done using the lattice @xmath125 .",
    "then , moving @xmath147 to approach the null boundary of @xmath10 its volume goes to zero reducing the number of independent degrees of freedom that the surface can hold .",
    "as both cauchy surfaces must have the same number of independent degrees of freedom since they describe the same physics , most of the degrees of freedom of @xmath128 must not be independent .",
    "however , the degrees of freedom in the spatial corner may well turn out to be independent when restricting attention to the particular diamond set @xmath10 .    in the following section we will give evidence in the context of a simple example that the lattice @xmath148 does indeed choose the non positive expansion condition for the applicability of the entropy bound .",
    "in this section we consider spatially flat three dimensional friedman - robertson - walker models with a metric given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the conformal time , @xmath151 , and the exponent @xmath152 is taken in the range @xmath153 .",
    "we focus on spatial one dimensional surfaces @xmath3 formed by an arc of a circle at fixed @xmath154 .",
    "we show that the set generated doing the double orthogonal in the lattice @xmath148 of the set formed by @xmath155 orthogonal points along @xmath3 plus a single additional orthogonal point , approximates the light sheets of negative expansion corresponding to @xmath3 in the limit of small @xmath117 . here",
    "@xmath156 is the area of @xmath3 . on the contrary ,",
    "for positively expanding null congruences orthogonal to @xmath3 the implementation of this construction requires a greater number of points by unit surface than in the non expanding case , or it simply can not be realized with orthogonal points .",
    "this metric ( [ dsd ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath157 and the relation between time and conformal time is given by @xmath158 from here we see that the hubble radius @xmath159 is given by @xmath160 .",
    "the case @xmath161 corresponds to flat space - time .",
    "the geodesic equation for a curve @xmath162 is @xmath163 the solution for null geodesics is simply @xmath164 where @xmath8 is a constant",
    ". we will be interested in small deviations from the null geodesics with @xmath154 growing with @xmath165 , then we write @xmath166 with @xmath167 .",
    "the linearized geodesic equation is @xmath168 the solution of this equation that departs from the point @xmath169 , @xmath170 is @xmath171 where @xmath128 is a small constant , negative for space - like geodesics and positive for time - like geodesics .",
    "the square distance along these geodesics from @xmath169 to @xmath172 is @xmath173 and its first order expression in @xmath128 is given by @xmath174    we have now all the elements for analyzing the following geometry .",
    "let the spatial surface @xmath3 be an arc of circle of radius @xmath175 in the plane @xmath176 .",
    "let @xmath177 be the a set of points along @xmath3 distanced @xmath178 between neighbors , where @xmath179 is a small quantity of the order of the cutoff scale @xmath117 , and covering in this way @xmath3 .",
    "we are assuming that the size of @xmath3 is much greater than the cutoff @xmath117 .",
    "take two neighbor points @xmath180 in @xmath177 , and without loss of generality assume that they have coordinates @xmath181 ( see fig",
    "the intersecting null geodesics coming from @xmath182 and @xmath183 will intersect each other at the plane @xmath184 .",
    "any pair of these intersecting null geodesic with intersection point @xmath143 will form the edges of a null surface @xmath185 converging to @xmath143 and bounded below by the sector of @xmath3 between @xmath186 and @xmath183 .",
    "let the point @xmath143 be given by the coordinates @xmath187 written at second order in @xmath188 .",
    "thus , @xmath143 is at null distance from all points in @xmath177 .",
    "the transversal area on the null surface @xmath185 at the coordinate @xmath121 is @xmath189 .",
    "this is increasing for @xmath190 when @xmath191 .",
    "in such case the null surface @xmath192 is not a light sheet in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we intend to approximate @xmath185 using the set generated by @xmath177 and an additional point @xmath193 orthogonal to @xmath177 and very near @xmath143 .",
    "the best chance is taking @xmath193 to have the maximal distance square required to be orthogonal to @xmath194 , @xmath195 . using ( [ ese ] ) with @xmath196 and @xmath197 to zero order ( @xmath128 is already small ) , we obtain @xmath128 , and replacing in ( [ equ ] ) we have @xmath198    now we want to explore the conditions under which @xmath193 and @xmath177 generate a set approximating @xmath185 . if we find that a point @xmath199 , very near the surface @xmath185 , belongs to the orthogonal of @xmath200 ( and then to the orthogonal of @xmath201 ) , then the generated set will not contain a hole in @xmath185 below or above @xmath199 , because all past and future of @xmath199 is not included in @xmath202 .",
    "the form of the generated set @xmath203 will be shaped as the intersection of the opposites of the points in @xmath204 .",
    "if such a point @xmath199 near @xmath192 does not exist , then it can be seen that the points in @xmath205 that could impede the generation of a set approximating @xmath192 must be near the extension of the null generators of @xmath192 beyond @xmath192 .",
    "it is easy to see that if there are points in @xmath177 along a non infinitesimal arc on each side of @xmath206 and @xmath183 , there are no points in @xmath207 near the null generators of @xmath192 extended at the future of @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , in the case no such a point @xmath199 can be found , a point near @xmath192 will be generated for each @xmath121 between @xmath208 and @xmath175 .",
    "thus , we search points @xmath199 capable of making holes in the generated set , and we situate @xmath199 with a coordinate @xmath209 and on the plane @xmath184 .",
    "the reason for this last election is that the distance from @xmath193 is the same in the whole arc of radius @xmath210 around @xmath175 , while if one chooses a point @xmath199 with some @xmath211 there is less distance square to one of the points @xmath206 or @xmath212 and more to the other .",
    "thus , as the distance square from @xmath199 to both has to be less than @xmath213 , the best chance is with @xmath184 .",
    "points @xmath199 displaced along the @xmath30 direction beyond the surface @xmath192 can be orthogonal to @xmath206 and @xmath183 , but they are taken into account in the next patch of null surface corresponding to other points in @xmath177 .",
    "thus we choose @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a small quantity and @xmath216 . using ( [ equ ] ) and ( [ ese ] ) we obtain the distance square @xmath217 that is given by @xmath218 likewise ,",
    "we compute the distance square between @xmath199 and @xmath193 , @xmath219 as mentioned , for making holes in the generated set we have to demand @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "these translates into the following conditions for @xmath215 @xmath222 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given @xmath152 and @xmath175 we have to satisfy these conditions for @xmath223 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath224 .",
    "if a point @xmath199 is in @xmath225 @xmath226 , then all the points in the null surface @xmath185 for @xmath184 and smaller @xmath121 will be time like connected with @xmath199 and will not be in the generated set .",
    "the condition for the existence of @xmath227 can be restated as @xmath228    for a given @xmath229 , taking @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 , we see that there are always solutions for any @xmath188 when the surface is big enough .",
    "thus , surfaces with big @xmath175 are not generated given a fixed @xmath179 .",
    "for @xmath233 we have points in @xmath207 in the initial surface and a set converging to @xmath192 for small @xmath117 will not be generated .",
    "let us take the minimal set of orthogonal elements in the spatial surface that do not admit the addition of other orthogonal points , that is , we take @xmath179 to be an infinitesimal smaller than @xmath117 . with",
    "such a choice the function ( [ func ] ) is decreasing with @xmath234",
    ". then it suffice to take the limit @xmath235 . there",
    "the condition ( [ func ] ) becomes @xmath236    therefore , for expanding surfaces , the number of orthogonal points required in the spatial surface @xmath3 to generate the approximate null surface will be greater than the minimal orthogonal set of points that cover ( but not generate by themselves ) the surface @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this does not happen for contracting surfaces , where it suffices with taking @xmath155 points on the surface @xmath3 of area @xmath156 .    for @xmath237 we can still generate the set converging to @xmath192 in certain range of @xmath175 , with the point @xmath193 plus orthogonal points in the initial surface , leading to an extension of the holographic idea , but where the number of degrees of freedom per unit area is increased with respect to the standard value applicable to the non expanding case . for a large enough @xmath175",
    "it is not possible to choose @xmath179 in this range to generate the surface . of course it",
    "can still be generated with non orthogonal points , for small enough @xmath179 .",
    "numerically , certain conservation of the number of points seems to hold . for a given @xmath175 let @xmath238 be the maximal @xmath179 such that there exist no @xmath234 such that eq.([func ] ) holds .",
    "then let the area of maximal expansion for the initial surface of area @xmath239 be @xmath240 .",
    "it is @xmath241 .",
    "therefore the number of points needed in the surface @xmath3 ( in general non orthogonal points ) is very similar to the minimal number of orthogonal points needed to cover the surface of maximal expansion .",
    "we hope that an analysis on the same line involving the geodesic deviation equation would yield the result of this section on the relation between the covariant entropy bound and the geometry given by the lattice @xmath125 , in a more general context .",
    "we have seen , considering the geometry of classical space - time , that there exist two well differentiated classes of orthocomplemented nets of causal sets .",
    "one is given by the orthomodular net @xmath34 , which is related to the usual picture of using independent data on cauchy surfaces .",
    "the other class is of non orthomodular nets , that can be related to a reduction of degrees of freedom of the holographic type .",
    "we have argued that the second type of nets should be used for constructing algebraic quantum theories if there is a cutoff scale .",
    "somewhat at the extreme of the non orthomodular behavior is the lattice @xmath109 , that , being conformally invariant , does not differentiate between contracting and expanding light - sheets .",
    "when regularizing the lattices one takes into account the metric in addition to the causal structure , and the resulting behavior is intermediate between @xmath34 and @xmath116 .",
    "we have constructed the non orthomodular lattice @xmath148 that implements a covariant cutoff for the causal lattices .",
    "this allows a geometrical definition of the number of degrees of freedom for an arbitrary set in space - time .",
    "we have seen that this number is consistent with the bousso covariant entropy bound in a simple example , where it reproduces the non negative expansion condition for the election of light - sheets .",
    "an important point suggested by the lattices constructed in this work is that while the covariant entropy bound would hold in its original form , the holographic projection for a diamond shaped set or a light sheet would not be simply to degrees of freedom on the spatial bounding surface . these are most of the independent degrees of freedom , but something more seems to be needed along the light sheet or its tip to close the algebra .",
    "the lattice @xmath34 can be taken as a description of the causal structure in classical space - time @xcite .",
    "it is othomodular and it also has an interpretation in terms of physical propositions for classical theories . as we have argued the corresponding object that describes causality when space - time can not be taken classical at all the scales should be a non orthomodular lattice . if the causal propositions remain physical propositions that would mean that orthomodularity is lost as a property of the quantum logic structure .",
    "a change of the quantum mechanics postulates in a cosmological scenario is advocated for example in ref.@xcite",
    ".    it would be interesting to explore the purely geometrical problem posed by the lattice @xmath148 .",
    "does it reproduces the holographic property for a general space - time ? .",
    "a precise formulation for this statement is the following . given a codimension 2 spatial surface @xmath3 and one of its light - sheets @xmath6 , and let @xmath146 be the minimal number of orthogonal points needed to generate a set covering @xmath10 in space - time .",
    "then we would like to test if @xmath242 , or find the conditions for its validity .",
    "more generally , the lattice @xmath148 suggests a generalized geometrical version of entropy bound .",
    "this is simply that the entropy in a set @xmath10 has to be less than a constant times @xmath146 .",
    "the constant has to be adjusted to match the covariant bound when appropriate , and is given by @xmath243 in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "thus , this geometrical bound would be independent of @xmath117 when the cutoff is taken smaller than all the curvature scales in the set .    in relation to this idea",
    "arises the question of what kind of regularization could lead to the stronger form of covariant entropy bound given in @xcite , which is related to the bekenstein entropy bound @xcite , and implies the generalized second law .",
    "this can not be deduced from the counting of degrees of freedom by the lattice @xmath148 .",
    "here we have assumed a base classical space - time and a net of local algebras of operators in hilbert space as a generalized form of quantum field theory .",
    "this structure should appear above some distance scale .",
    "what seems to be odd is that , following what we have argued , the covariant entropy bound would hold in a form logically independent of the einstein equations for the metric .",
    "after all the einstein equations are essential for curving the space in such a way to save the bound in several examples @xcite . however , the order of the implications could possibly be inverted using an idea by jacobson @xcite . in that work",
    "the einstein equations are deduced starting from the area law for the entropy , and using the second law of thermodynamics as seen by accelerated observers to relate a heat flux given by the stress tensor with the area expansion .",
    "thus , it seems likely that to implement an effective theory valid above some smallest fundamental scale gravity should appear as a requirement of self consistency .",
