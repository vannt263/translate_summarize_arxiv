    "quantum correlations in many - qubit systems are responsible for the effective work of quantum devices ( in particular , quantum computers ) and give them significant advantages over their classical counterparts @xcite . in order to create quantum devices we have to study quantum correlations and to control them .",
    "spin systems are very suitable for the study of quantum correlations due to the developed theoretical methods @xcite and the experimental methods of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite for the excitation , detection and coherent control of the individual spin states .    until recently it has been accepted that entanglement is responsible for quantum correlations , and quantum devices can be created only on the basis of using materials with entangled states @xcite .",
    "however , it has turned out that quantum algorithms @xcite which significantly outperform the classical counterparts can work using mixed separable ( non - entangled ) states . furthermore , it turned out that quantum non - locality can be observed in systems without entanglement @xcite . from this",
    "we can conclude that entanglement describes only a part of quantum correlations but not all of them . according to the current understanding @xcite ,",
    "total ( quantum and classical ) correlations in a system are defined by the mutual information .",
    "the problem is how to separate the classical correlations from the quantum ones .",
    "this problem was solved independently by henderson and vedral @xcite as well as ollivier and zurek @xcite .",
    "the classical correlations in a two - partite system are determined by a complete set of projective measurements carried out only over one of the subsystems @xcite .",
    "then a measure of quantum correlations ( the quantum discord ) is determined as the difference between the mutual information and its classical part , maximized over all possible projective measurements @xcite .",
    "the quantum discord is determined completely by quantum properties of the system and equals zero for classical systems .",
    "computing the quantum discord is a rather tedious problem because we must optimize the quantum conditional entropy over all possible complete sets of measurements in any subsystem of the system under study @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that computing quantum discord is np - complete .",
    "the already developed methods [ 11@xmath313 ] permit computing the discord only in two - qubit systems [ 14@xmath317 ] and in the simplest three - qubit systems @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it is very important to calculate the quantum discord in many - qubit systems .",
    "for example , the many - qubit quantum discord is significant for solving problems of nmr quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is well known that nmr is used to obtain an experimental implementation of quantum algorithms in few - qubit systems .",
    "the quantum entanglement vanishes at room temperatures in highly mixed states that occur in liquid - phase nmr experiments @xcite . this raised doubts that nmr can be used to demonstrate the advantages of quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts in multiqubit systems @xcite .",
    "the quantum discord does not vanish @xcite in mixed states in nmr experiments in contrast to the entanglement and indicates that quantum correlations exist in many - qubit systems .",
    "experimental studies @xcite using nmr - tomography methods @xcite support this conclusion .",
    "the development of methods for computing the quantum discord in many - qubit systems is therefore very relevant .",
    "there are a lot of different nmr methods in solids which can be used for experimental investigations of quantum correlations .",
    "first of all , notice the methods of spin echo and free induction decay @xcite",
    ". the time evolution of signals of spin echo and free induction decay in the system of an electron ( or a hetero - nucleus ) surrounded by a cloud of other nuclei can give very important information about quantum discord and its evolution @xcite .",
    "we notice also multiple quantum nmr methods @xcite which allow us to obtain the time and temperature dependencies of quantum correlations @xcite .    we have suggested @xcite a spin model for the calculation of the quantum discord . in our model , a linear chain of spins , coupled by the dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) in a strong external magnetic field ,",
    "is connected with an impurity spin by the heisenberg @xmath2-interaction .",
    "this model can be used for the analysis of nmr experiments in solids , both at low and high temperatures .",
    "the developed approach @xcite allows us to study quantum correlations and their unitary evolution in the conditions of nmr experiments .",
    "unfortunately , in that model the quantum discord can only be calculated numerically with the random mutation algorithm @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculation of the quantum discord for the model @xcite is possible only for three - qubit systems @xcite .",
    "later we understood @xcite that it is possible to find the quantum discord analytically for many - qubit systems if one considers a spin ring instead of a spin chain used in @xcite .",
    "we note that this model can be applied not only to heteronuclear systems , but also to electron - nuclear ones .",
    "if we consider a central electron spin surrounded by a ring of nuclear spins then the model is close to the model of deterministic quantum calculations with one qubit ( dqc1 ) @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that the multiqubit spin ring model can be investigated by standard tools [ 11@xmath313 ] for two - part binary systems .",
    "however , we simplify those methods with an optimization of the quantum conditional entropy over the parameters of the projectors . as a result , this approach allows us to investigate contributions of different interactions to quantum correlations .",
    "the main goal of the article is the investigation of the quantum correlations in a spin ring system and the determination of the contributions of different parts of spin - spin interactions to quantum correlations at different relation between the larmor frequencies of the ring spins and the impurity one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a spin ring system , coupled with a central spin , in the external magnetic field is presented in sect .",
    "the optimization of the quantum conditional entropy in the high temperature approximation is considered in sect .",
    "calculations of the quantum discord are given in sect .",
    "4 at different relations between the larmor frequencies of the spin subsystems .",
    "a comparison of quantum and classical correlations in the course of the system evolution is given in sect .",
    "5 . we briefly summarize our results in sect .",
    "we consider a ring of nuclear spins ( @xmath4 ) , coupled by the ddi in a strong external magnetic field . we will call it subsystem @xmath5 . the distances between spins of subsystem @xmath5 are not necessarily the same .",
    "subsystem @xmath5 interacts with an impurity spin @xmath6 , which is in the center of the ring ( subsystem @xmath7 , fig .",
    "1 ) . the strong external magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of fig . 1 .",
    "many - spin systems for the investigation of the quantum discord .",
    "subsystem @xmath5 is a ring of spins , coupled by the ddi .",
    "the impurity spin ( in the center of the ring ) , connected by the @xmath2-interactions with the ring spins , represents subsystem @xmath7 . ]",
    "we will consider the problem in the high temperature approximation @xcite .",
    "thes approximation is widely used in different problems of spin dynamics and magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "for example , the high temperature approximation in systems of spins coupled by ddi is valid @xcite at @xmath8 where @xmath9 is proportional to the inverse temperature @xcite of the system ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the larmor frequencies .    the proof is given in ref . @xcite and it is based an the fact that the ddi is inversely proportional to the cube of the distances between spins . however , it is not so in the considered case .",
    "for example , @xmath1 spins interact with the central spin and all coupling constants are equal to each other .",
    "the dependence of the ddi coupling constants of the ring spins on the distances between spins is very weak and the conditions ( [ eq:11 ] ) are insufficiently .",
    "it is evident that the conditions should be modified .",
    "we expect that the high temperature approximation holds when @xmath12 the conditions of eq.([eq:12 ] ) are valid for small spin clusters .",
    "decoherence ( in particular , external noise ) is determined by the relaxation times @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite which are sufficiently long for such clusters in nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , we can neglect noise in our spin systems in the calculation of quantum correlations .    in the initial moment of time ,",
    "the system is in the thermodynamic equilibrium state . in the high temperature approximation @xcite ,",
    "the density matrix @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 points in the direction of the external magnetic field ; @xmath18 is the total number of the spins ( @xmath1 is the number of the ring spins ) ; @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the @xmath17-projections of the @xmath22-th spin on the ring and the impurity spin . applying resonance ( for spins @xmath23 and @xmath6 ) @xmath24-radiofrequency pulses of the magnetic field around the axis @xmath25 in the rotating reference frames ( for spins @xmath26 and @xmath6 ) @xcite , we create conditions for the emergence of quantum correlations during the evolution of the spin system .",
    "formally , such initiating pulses lead to the replacement of the operators @xmath27 , @xmath21 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are projections of the @xmath22-th ring spin and the impurity spin on the axis @xmath33 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath34 . here",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath35 describes the secular ddi in the strong external magnetic field in the spin ring ( subsystem @xmath5 ) .",
    "this secular part of the ddi can be written as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ddi coupling constant of ring spins @xmath22 , @xmath38 ; and @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath40 characterizes the interaction between subsystems @xmath5 , and @xmath7 and equals @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coupling constant of the ring spins with the impurity spin , which has a different gyromagnetic ratio from the ring spins . we took into account that the coupling constants of the @xmath2-interactions in the considered case ( see fig . 1 ) are the same for all ring spins ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) ) .",
    "it means that the hamiltonians @xmath35 and @xmath40 commute at an arbitrary number of the ring spins .",
    "this property holds in the model with a linear spin chain instead of a spin ring only for a chain with two spins @xcite .",
    "thus , subsystem @xmath5 is only subject to the dipole evolution in the considered case . since",
    "a unitary local transformation does not change the discord , we can ignore the dipolar evolution of subsystem @xmath5 in our calculations .",
    "taking into account that the evolution of the system is determined by the heisenberg @xmath2-interactions only , one can write the density matrix of the system as @xmath43 \\\\                      \\qquad   + \\beta\\omega_b[s_x\\cos(2\\tau i_z ) + s_y\\sin(2\\tau i_z)]\\big\\ } , \\label{eq:4 }        \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the dimensionless time .",
