    "in a survey of southern radio galaxies , tadhunter _",
    "et al . _ @xcite find that the luminosity of the optical emission lines is strongly correlated with the radio luminosity .",
    "an exception are a group of objects , dubbed weak - line radio galaxies ( wlrg ) , in which the [ o  iii ] line is an order of magnitude fainter than in galaxies of comparable radio luminosity and redshift .",
    "the low - ionization [ o  ii ] and h@xmath0 lines strengths , however , are not as drastically reduced in wlrgs .",
    "this observation _ suggests _ that the optical emission lines properties of wlrgs may be quite similar to those seen in liners .",
    "even stronger evidence of a connection between wlrgs and accretion powered liners is found in the x - ray and uv . in an analysis of asca data sambruna _",
    "_ @xcite find that wlrgs are a distinct class of object , set apart from the other radio - loud agn at 5ghz .",
    "] by their low x - ray luminosity and flat x - ray spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ wlrgfig ] ) .",
    "ho @xcite also finds that the asca spectra of accretion - powered liners are somewhat harder than those of radio - quiet agn .",
    "however , it must be noted that the nucleus need not dominate the emission from the galaxy in either wlrgs or liners @xcite . to determine the true x - ray characteristics of the central engine , it is vitally important to obtain high spatial resolution x - ray data , such as that obtained with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of liners shows a significant lack of uv emission .",
    "although it is difficult to measure the sed of wlrgs in the optical - uv band due to the significant absorption column , a similar decrement is measured in at least one wlrg ( fig .",
    "[ wlrgsed ] ) .",
    "thus there is mounting evidence that the optical emission - line properties as well as the underlying ionizing continuum are similar in wlrgs and liners .",
    "should a connection between the central engines of accretion - powered liners and wlrgs be confirmed , this would place important constraints on the structure of the accretion flow in these objects .",
    "any proposed model must be able to explain the behavior of both liners * and * wlrgs .",
    "in particular , the engine must be able to produce the kpc - sized radio jets seen in wlrgs .",
    "in this paper we present optical spectra of 11 wlrgs and demonstrate that the emission line properties of wlrgs and liners are in fact quite similar to each other .",
    "this work represents the _ first step _ in our multi - wavelength program to better understand the central engines in wlrgs and the possible connection between liners and wlrgs .",
    "the data set used here consists of spectra of 11 wlrgs , as listed in tab .",
    "the spectra were obtained at kpno 2.1 m , ctio 1.5 m and the mdm observatory 2.4 m telescopes . in order to measure the strengths of the emission lines , the starlight from the host galaxy",
    "must be subtracted .",
    "this was done by fitting a template elliptical galaxy to the spectrum ( adjusting the redshift and galactic reddening to match those of the object ) and then subtracting the fit from the object spectrum .",
    "an example of the template subtraction is shown in fig . [ 1717 ] . some residual continuum remains , which was subtracted in the neighborhood of each emission line . each emission line",
    "was then fitted with a gaussian profile .",
    "finally , the fluxes measured from the model profiles were used to place wlrgs in several classification schemes for emission line galaxies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] @xcite .",
    "these diagnostics have been developed _ observationally _ over the past 20 years , as they cleary separate different classes of emission line galaxies .",
    "all of the objects are classified in at least one of the six 2d diagnostic diagrams ( fig . [ diag ] ) with the exception of oh-342 .",
    "we divide the objects into two main groups :    _ pure liners _ :",
    "these objects fall within the liner region in all diagrams for which the necessary lines were measured .    _ composite liners _ : while showing evidence of liner - like emission in some diagrams , several objects are also classified as a seyfert and/or h  ii region in others .",
    "other objects consistently straddle the boundary between liners and seyferts or h  ii regions .",
    "all of these objects are classified as composites .",
    "most of the wlrgs ( 81@xmath1 ) in our sample are classified as either a pure ( @xmath2 ) or composite ( 45@xmath1 ) liner ( tab .",
    "ngc 612 is classified as a seyfert and oh-342 , not shown , is likely to be a seyfert based upon its large [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 ratio .",
    ".weak - line radio galaxies in the current sample [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown that the optical emission line properties of most wlrgs * are * similar to liners .",
    "several objects in our sample are classified as composites due to the large error bars on the measurements .",
    "better optical spectra of some objects are needed to solidify the classification .",
    "we have obtained additional spectra , including new objects , which we are currently reducing and analyzing .",
    "high spatial resolution spectroscopy from the ground or with hst will also be helpful in this respect .",
    "however , it is likely that wlrg , like liners are a diverse group of objects .",
    "the central engine need not dominate the energetics of the galaxy and other excitation sources such as a hot stars , shocks , or cooling flows may play an important role in the formation of the emission lines . in hyd",
    "a , for example , uv observations reveal a circumnuclear ring of star formation @xcite .    to determine whether wlrgs and liners are physically similar , it is necessary to study the seds of wlrgs . in the uv and x - ray regimes",
    "this is quite challenging .",
    "there appears to be a deficit of uv photons in wlrgs ( fig .",
    "[ wlrgsed ] ) , but the high absorption column ( nh @xmath3 in some cases ) makes a uv flux measurement , or even a useful upper limit , virtually impossible to obtain .",
    "until recently , the nuclear region of wlrgs and liners have not been spatially resolved in x - rays , making it impossible to truly determine the x - ray portion of the sed . a recent _ chandra _ observation of hydra a @xcite has demonstrated that while there can be several sources of x - ray emission in wlrgs , the nucleus can be successfully isolated from the host galaxy .",
    "considering the difficulty of the uv observations , studies of wlrgs in the x - ray regime are the best hope for constraining their sed .",
    "the results of this work strongly suggest that liners and wlrgs may be intimately related .",
    "more detailed studies in the uv and particularly x - ray will solidify this relationship and lead to an improved understanding of the structure of the accretion flow in both liners and wlrgs .",
