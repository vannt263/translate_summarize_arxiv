    "we note a striking similarity to the signal processing scenario  @xcite , where the output of a linear time - invariant ( lti ) network ( e.g. an rlc electric circuit ) is characterized through a `` transfer function '' . for such networks , combination rules in terms of serial ,",
    "parallel , and feedback loop motifs exist .",
    "the result for @xmath48 in eq .   can be seen in a similar light : the first term is the self - response @xmath62 of object x which is independent of the presence of object y. the rational function in the second term is the `` feedback '' due to x interacting with y. as expected , if the cross - response @xmath47 connecting the two ends of x is turned off , this feedback disappears . in analogy to the transfer function theory for lti systems , our convolution rules form a comprehensive basis to describe the response of an arbitrarily complicated network inside a force clamp experiment . and",
    "like the transfer functions which arise out of lti feedback loops , the convolution of interacting components consists of a nonlinear combination of the individual response functions .",
    "the rational functions due to the feedback of mechanical perturbations across the connected elements are non - trivial , but can be exactly accounted for via iteration of the convolution rules .",

    "( in the si we analyze simulation results for a protein exhibiting a double - well free energy , where the two states can be analyzed independently by pooling data from every visit to a given well ; the same idea can be readily extended to analyze time series data from proteins with one or more intermediate states . )",
    "we consider the protein dynamics as diffusion of the reaction coordinate @xmath63 ( the protein end - to - end distance ) in a free energy landscape @xmath64 .",
    "the end - to - end response function @xmath61 reflects the shape of @xmath65 around the local minimum , and the internal protein friction ( i.e the local mobility ) , which is the key quantity of interest .",

    "depending on the resolution and quality of the experimental data , more complex fitting forms may be substituted , including anharmonic corrections and non - constant diffusivity profiles ( an example of these is given in the two - state protein case analyzed in the si ) .",
    "however for practical purposes eq .   is a good starting point .",
    "an experimentalist seeking to determine @xmath70 would carry out the following two - step procedure :        _ first step : _ make a preliminary run using a system without the protein ( just two beads and two handles , as illustrated in fig .",

    ". we can thus solve for the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath78 which appear in eq .  .",

    "even analyzing the unfolded state of the protein might yield interesting results : certain forces might be strong enough to destroy the tertiary structure , but not completely destabilize the secondary structure , which could transiently refold and affect @xmath68 .      to demonstrate the two - step deconvolution procedure in a realistic context , we perform brownian dynamics simulations mimicking a typical force clamp experiment : two beads that undergo rotational and translational fluctuations are trapped in 3d harmonic potentials and connected to two semiflexible polymers which are linked together via a potential function that represents the protein folding landscape ( see mm for details ) .",
    "we ignore hydrodynamic effects which can easily be accounted for through parallel coupling pathways , as mentioned above .",

    "@xmath56 differs substantially from both of these as correctly predicted by the convolution theory .",
    "the effect of adding handles and beads to the protein is to shift the peak in the imaginary part of the total system response to lower frequencies .",

    "the characteristic frequency of the protein within the tweezer setup falls within the cutoff , and hence our two - step deconvolution procedure can still be applied to yield accurate best - fit results for the protein parameters .",

    "dynamic deconvolution theory allows us to extract the response functions of a single component from the overall response of a multicomposite network .",
    "the theory is most transparently formulated in the frequency domain , and provides the means to reverse the filtering influence of all elements that are connected to the component of interest . from the extracted single - component response function , dynamic properties such as the internal mobility or friction can be directly deduced . at the heart of our theory stands the observation that the response of any component in the network is completely determined by three functions , namely the cross response and the two self responses , which are in general different at the two ends .",
    "the response of any network can be predicted by repeated iteration of our convolution formulas for serial and parallel connections .",
    "self - similar or more complicated network topologies , as occur in visco - elastic media , can thus be treated as well .",
    "we demonstrate the application of our deconvolution theory for a simple mechanical network that mimics a double - laser - tweezer setup , but the underlying idea is directly analogous to the signal processing rules which describe other scalar dynamic networks , such as electrical circuits or chemical reaction pathways in systems biology  @xcite .",
    "we finally point out that dynamic convolution also occurs in fret experiments on proteins where polymeric linkers and conformational fluctuations of fluorophores , as well as the internal fluorescence dynamics , modify the measured dynamic fluctuation spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the experimental challenge in the future will thus be to generate time - series data for single biomolecules with a sufficient frequency range in order to perform an accurate deconvolution .",
    "for this a careful matching of the relevant time and spatial scales of the biomolecule under study and the corresponding scales of the measuring device ( handles as well as beads ) is crucial , for which our theory provides the necessary guidance .",
    "a key step in the experimental analysis is to obtain the system response functions @xmath113 and @xmath24 from the raw data ( which can either be the double handle - bead system with or without a protein ) .",
    "this data consists of two time series @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the left / right bead positions from which we calculate the mean square displacement ( msd ) functions @xmath116 where @xmath117 , and we have averaged the self msd of the two endpoints because they are identical by symmetry .",

    "generally the larger the correlation time @xmath473 for the specific msd of interest , the longer the sampling time necessary to achieve a certain level of precision ( i.e. a self msd , involving the motion of the individual trapped beads , will typically have a slower relaxation time than an end - to - end msd ) .",
