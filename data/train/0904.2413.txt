    "over the last few years , a number of observational discoveries have placed `` magnetars '' ( ultra - magnetized isolated neutron stars ) in the limelight again .",
    "these extreme objects comprise the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; 10 objects ) , and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ; 4 objects ) , which are observationally very similar classes in many respects ( for a recent review see mereghetti et al .",
    "they are all slow x - ray pulsars with spin periods clustered in a narrow range ( @xmath6 212s ) , relatively large period derivatives ( @xmath7ss@xmath8 ) , spin - down ages of @xmath9yr , and magnetic fields , as inferred from the classical magnetic dipole spin - down formula , of @xmath10 g , much higher than the electron quantum critical field ( @xmath11 g ) .",
    "about a dozen axps and sgrs are strong persistent x - ray emitters , with x - ray luminosities of about @xmath12 , and a few transient ones have been discovered in recent years .",
    "a peculiarity of these neutron stars is that their x - ray energy output is much larger than their rotational energy losses , so they can not be only rotationally powered .",
    "furthermore , they lack a companion , so they can not be accretion - powered either .",
    "rather , the powering mechanism of axps and sgrs is believed to reside in the neutron star ultra - strong magnetic field ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1993 ) . other scenarios , beside the `` magnetar '' model , were proposed to explain axp and sgr emission , such as the fossil disk ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; perna , hernquist , & narayan 2000 ) and the quark - star model ( ouyed , leahy , & niebergal 2007a , b ) .    in the 0.110kev energy band ,",
    "magnetars spectra are relatively soft and empirically modeled by an absorbed blackbody ( @xmath130.20.6  kev ) plus a power - law ( @xmath1424 ) .",
    "thanks to _ integral_isgri and _ rxte_hexte , hard x - ray emission up to @xmath1200kev has recently been detected from some sources ( kuiper et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; mereghetti et al . 2005 ; gtz et al .",
    "this discovery has opened a new window on magnetars studies and has shown that their energy output may be dominated by hard , rather than soft emission .    at variance with other isolated neutron stars , axps and sgrs exhibit spectacular episodes of bursting and flaring activity , during which their luminosity may change up to 10 orders of magnitude on timescales down to few milliseconds .",
    "different types of x - ray flux variability have been observed , ranging from slow and moderate flux changes up to a factor of a few on timescales of years ( shown by virtually all members of the class ) , to more intense outbursts with flux variations up to @xmath1100 lasting for @xmath11 - 3 years , and to short and intense x - ray burst activity on sub - second timescales ( see kaspi 2007 and mereghetti 2008 for reviews of x - ray variability ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we then studied the pre - outburst quiescent spectrum of as observed by _",
    "rosat_. the quiescent spectrum was well fit by either a bb or pl single - component model ( see fig .",
    "[ figspecall ] ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are n@xmath15=6@xmath16 10@xmath17 cm@xmath5 and kt=0.38@xmath19kev for the bb , and n@xmath15=8@xmath20 10@xmath17 cm@xmath5 and @xmath210.6 for the pl ( reduced @xmath22=1.08 and @xmath22=1.13 for 17 d.o.f . , respectively ) .",
    "the 0.12.4 kev observed flux is f@xmath231.4@xmath310@xmath24erg cm@xmath5 s@xmath8 , corresponding to an extrapolated 110kev fluxes of 1.3 and 4.2 @xmath310@xmath24erg cm@xmath5 s@xmath8 for the bb and pl models , respectively . in analogy with the quiescent spectra of other magnetars , and given the slightly better reduced @xmath22 we assume that the bb spectral modeling is more correct .",
    "no spectral features were detected in the phase - averaged _ xmm  newton _ spectra , with 3@xmath25 upper limits to the equivalent width of 45 and 65ev , for a gaussian absorption line with @xmath26=5ev ( using the rgs spectra ) and @xmath26=100ev ( using the pn spectra ) , respectively .",
    "we performed a phase - resolved spectroscopy ( prs ) for all the _ xmm  newton _ observations .",
    "we generated 10 phase - resolved spectra for each observation using the ephemeris reported in ",
    "[ timing ] .",
    "the choice of the number of intervals was made _ a priori _ in order to have enough statistics in each phase  resolved spectrum to detect , at a 3@xmath25 confidence level , a spectral line with an equivalent width @xmath27 30 ev ( although none was detected ) .",
    "note that given the phase - connection of all the 5 _ xmm  newton _ observations ( see  [ timing ] ) , we can reliably follow each phase - resolved spectrum in time .",
    "the absorbed bb plus pl model provides excellent fits for all ten phase - resolved spectra in all the observations , both when leaving free and when fixing it to the most accurate value derived in the phase - averaged fitting of all five _ xmm  newton _ observations ( see tab.[tabspec ] ) . in fig.[pps ] we have plotted the parameters derived from the prs analysis and compared them to the pulse profile in each observation .",
    "all the observations showed significant spectral variability with phase , as well as a general softening in time .",
    "in particular , the blackbody temperature and normalization follow the pulse profile shape rather well , and remaining on average rather constant throughout the outburst , with a slightly decrease in the last _ xmm  newton _ observation . on the other hand , the power - law parameters vary in phase and follow a more complex behaviour , with a double - peaked change of the photon index ( see also fig.[3dpulsenergy ] , and ",
    "[ discussion ] for further discussion ) .",
    "in the last few years , thanks to the availability of wide field x - ray instruments , as _ swift_-bat , several outbursts from known axp and sgr have been observed , and monitored in great detail .",
    "the detection of an outburst from has a special significance since this is the first new sgr discovered over a decade . in this paper",
    "we presented a comprehensive study of the spectral and timing properties of the source in the x - rays during the entire evolution of the outburst , starting from @xmath28 day after the activation and up to @xmath29 days later .",
    "our investigation is based on _ xmm  newton _ , _",
    "swift_-xrt , and _ integral_data and we also re - examined _ rosat _  archival data in which the quiescent emission of  was detected .",
    "thanks to the _ xmm  newton _ and _ swift_-xrt quasi - continuous monitoring ( see  [ xmm ] and  [ swift ] ) , we could study in detail the flux decay of  and give an estimate of its typical timescale . fitting the flux evolution in the first 160days after the onset of the bursting activity , we found that an exponential function of the form flux(t ) = @xmath30 provides a good representation of the data ( = 1.2 ) ; the best values of the parameters are @xmath312 , @xmath322 , and @xmath33 days ( see fig.[figfluxdecay ] ) .",
    "a fit with a power - law was not found to be satisfactory ( = 12 ) . comparing the outburst decay timescale of with other magnetars ( see fig.[figoutbursts ] ) , there is a clear difference in timescales . in particular , the outburst decays of other magnetars are usually fitted by two components : an initial exponential or power - law component accounting for the very fast decrease in the first day or so ( successfully observed only in a very few cases ) , followed by a much flatter power - law with an index of @xmath34 , where flux(t ) @xmath35 ( see woods et al . 2004 ; israel et al .",
    "2007 ; esposito et al . 2008 ) .",
    "a pure exponential flux decay with a timescale of about 24 days is unusual and has been never observed before .",
    "however , we caveat that the source did not reach the quiescent level yet , hence a second component ( e.g. a power - law ) in the flux decay can still appear at later times .",
    "further monitoring observations will allow in the future a complete modeling of the outburst decay until the quiescent source level .    from tab.[tabspec ] and",
    "fig.[3dpulsenergy ] it is apparent that , at least in the first ten days of the outburst , the flux of the blackbody component decayed more slowly than that of the power - law one , both in the phase - average and the phase - resolved spectra .",
    "in particular , fitting the phase - average bb and pl fluxes of the first 4 _ xmm  newton _ observations ( see tab.[tabspec ] ) with a linear function of the form flux(t)=@xmath36 we found a good fit for @xmath372 and @xmath382 , and with @xmath392 and @xmath402 . while the pl flux decreased by @xmath41 from the first to the second observation ( and kept decreasing at a reduced rate in observations three and four ) , the bb flux stayed approximately constant during the first four observations .",
    "both fluxes then substantially decreased in observation five ( see also  [ secpps ] and next section for the evolution of the phase - resolved spectra ) .",
    "the relative decays of the thermal and non - thermal components observed here are reminiscent of those of after its intense burst of 2006 september 21 ( muno et al . 2007 ; israel et al . 2007 ) . even in that case , the pl component decayed more rapidly than the bb flux ( israel et al .",
    "the faster decay of the non - thermal emission from  is also corroborated by the non - detection of the source in the second _ integral _",
    "pointing ( see  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the transient character of the hard component we detected at the beginning of s outburst implies that , whatever the mechanism is , thermal bremsstrahlung in the surface layers heated by returning currents , synchrotron emission from pairs created higher up ( @xmath42 km ) in the magnetosphere ( thompson & beloborodov 2005 ) , or resonant up - scattering of seed photons on a population of highly relativistic electrons ( baring & harding 2007 ) , it has to be triggered by the source activity and quickly fade in a few days .",
    "all the previous scenarios are indeed compatible with the observed behaviour provided that a flow of highly relativistic particles is injected into the magnetosphere during the outburst . note that this is the first time that a variable hard x - ray emission is detected for a magnetar during an outburst .",
    "of course , our observations did not allow us to distinguish between a rapid spectral softening ( as expected if the particles responsible for the emission becomes less and less energetic ) and/or an overall fading of the hard component due to a decrease in its normalization ( as expected if the spatial region occupied / heated by such particles shrinks or if their local density decreases ) .",
    "several investigations have suggested that the observed magnetar spectra form in the magnetosphere , where thermal photons emitted from the neutron star s surface undergo repeated resonant scatterings ( thompson , lyutikov & kulkani 2002 ; lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ; fernandez & thompson 2007 ; rea et al .",
    "2008 ; nobili , turolla & zane 2008a ) . in this scenario , the spectral shape of the non - thermal component in the @xmath4310 kev band ( and possibly also that at _ integral _  energies ; see baring & harding 2007 , 2008 ; nobili , turolla & zane 2008b ) is governed by the amount of twist which is implanted in the magnetosphere as a consequence of large scale crustal motions ( star - quakes ) .",
    "the twist must decay , due to resistive ohmnic dissipation , in order to support its own currents ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 ; beloborodov 2009 ) and this , in turn , implies that the high - energy component of the spectrum has to fade .",
    "if either the initial twist is global or , as it seems more likely , it affects only a bundle of ( closed ) field lines ( e.g. near a magnetic pole ) , the magnetosphere evolves in such a way as to confine the current - carrying ( @xmath44 ) field lines closer to the magnetic axis ( beloborodov 2009 ) .",
    "this necessarily quenches resonant up - scattering because the value of the cyclotron energy in most of the region occupied by the current - carrying field lines ( which now extend to large radii ) drops below @xmath45 kev , the typical energy of thermal photons .",
    "thompson , lyutikov & kulkani ( 2002 ) and beloborodov & thompson ( 2007 ) pointed out that the surface of a magnetar with a twisted magnetosphere is heated by the returning currents .",
    "if the twist decays , the luminosity and the area of the heated surface decrease in time . however , while the thermal component is expected to survive over the timescale necessary to dissipate the twist energy , the non - thermal component is more short - lived , since resonant scattering is no longer possible when the current - carrying bundle becomes too small .",
    "by comparing the theoretical expectations for a typical twist duration and luminosity , beloborodov ( 2009 ) found an overall agreement with the observed properties of the transient axp , provided that the twist was localized . in the case of , the typical derived evolution time ( @xmath28 month ) requires both a twist confined to a small volume ( angular extent @xmath46 ) and a modest twist angle ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the distance of is not known yet , but it has recently been estimated to be @xmath48 kpc at the lowest ( aptekar et al . 2009 ) , which implies a minimum source peak luminosity @xmath49 . under this case",
    "the values of the magnetospheric parameters derived above from the timescale of the outburst evolution are too small to explain the observed luminosity in terms of dissipation of the twist energy alone ( @xmath50 ) , and the problem worsens if the source distance is larger ( unless the emission has a beaming factor @xmath51 ) .",
    "one possibility is that part of the energy has been released impulsively in the crust because of the dissipation of the toroidal field following the star - quake , as suggested to explain the decay of and ( lyubarsky , eichler & thompson 2003 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "however , this scenario predicts a power - law luminosity decline , @xmath52 , which is not observed in .",
    "we note that the flux decay may follow different laws in the untwisting magnetosphere model of beloborodov ( 2009 ) , and the observed different decay timescales of the thermal and non - thermal components fits in the latter scenario .",
    "to study the pulse profiles and the spectral changes in phase and time as a whole , we produced what we define hereafter as dynamic spectral profiles ( dsps ) , which are shown in fig.[dsp ] .",
    "each column in fig.[dsp ] is for one of the 5 _ xmm  newton _ observations ( epoch increases from left to right ) .",
    "each panel shows a contour plot of the @xmath53 flux as a function of phase and energy , and has been derived from the 10 phase - resolved spectra extracted as explained above .",
    "the second row refers to the total flux , as derived from the bb+pl model , while the third and the last rows show , respectively , the flux of the pl and bb components .",
    "the plots illustrate well how the source spectrum changes as phase and time , and show a clear evolution of the phase - dependent spectrum during the outburst . at energies above @xmath15kev",
    "the pl dominates the emission at all times . from the dsps , and by comparing the dsps with the pulse profiles ( see fig.[dsp ] top panel and also fig.[pulsenergy ] ) , it is also evident that most of the sub - peaks of the pulse profiles are related to the pl component ( this is particularly evident in the third and fourth _ xmm  newton _",
    "observations ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the main component of the profiles is dominated by the bb component , which is always in phase with the main peak . moreover , by looking at fig.[dsp ] it is again evident how the pl component decreases in intensity on a faster timescale than the bb component in all phases .",
    "actually the bb component is not only rather constant over the first four observations ( covering the first 10days after the bursting activation ) , but in some phases shows a re - brightening ( see fig.[3dpulsenergy ] , and the third panel in the last row of fig.[dsp ] ) .",
    "this is likely due to some late heating of the surface , e.g. by returning currents .",
    "the strong phase dependence of the non - thermal component may be explained by the fact that , in the twisted magnetosphere model , both the spatial distributions of the magnetospheric currents ( which act as a `` scattering medium '' ) and the surface emission induced by the returning currents ( which acts as source of seed photons for the resonant scattering ) are substantially anisotropic . even under the simple assumption where the magnetosphere is dipolar and globally twisted ,",
    "the heated part of the surface and the magnetospheric charges cover two different ranges of magnetic colatitude .",
    "if the twist angle varies during the outburst evolution , both distributions would move away or toward the poles but at different rates . of course , the situation is more complicated if the magnetospheric twist affects a limited bundle of field lines , as observations seem to indicate in  ( woods et al .",
    "2007 ) and in the transient axp ( perna & gotthelf 2008 ; bernardini et al .",
    "recent spectral calculations have shown the resonant comptonization in locally twisted multipolar fields can give rise to a hard tail which is highly phase dependent ( pavan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the phase - resolved spectral evolution of is very complicated , but a possible explanation for the variations of the pl component in terms of a magnetic field which is locally sheared , and the shear evolves in time , seems promising .      for about 20 years after their discovery",
    ", sgrs and axps were thought to be two distinct manifestations of highly magnetic neutron stars : the first mainly discovered and characterized by their powerful bursting activity , and the second recognized as bright persistent soft x - ray emitters with spectra empirically modelled by a bb+pl , and with little or no bursting activity .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of hard x - ray emission ( up to about 200kev ; kuiper et al .",
    "2006 ; gtz et al .",
    "2006 ) from a few members of both classes , added a further distinction , with axps having hard x - ray emission modelled by a second pl component ( in addition to the bb+pl describing the soft x - ray emission ) with @xmath54 , while the sgr emission was the natural extrapolation at higher energies of the pl component modelling their soft x - ray emission ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "over the past 6 years , the discovery of x - ray bursts from axps ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ; woods et al . 2004 ) , and of bb components in the persistent spectrum of sgrs ( mereghetti et al . 2005 , 2006a ) , initiated a revision of this distinction between these two classes .    in this context and e",
    "can be considered the rosetta stone for a final unification of sgrs , axps and the so called `` transient axps ( taxps ) '' , into a single class of `` magnetars candidates '' .",
    "in fact the properties of this new sgr , as well as the characteristics of the 2009 january 22 outburst of the axp e ( gelfand & gaensler 2007 ; halpern et al .",
    "2008 ; mereghetti et al . 2009",
    "; israel et al . 2009 in prep ) , argue for a revision of our definition of sgrs and axps .",
    "in particular , s 0.5 - 10kev spectrum during outburst , is extremely soft ( @xmath142.8 - 3.0 ) compared to other sgrs ( @xmath141.5 - 2.0 ) .",
    "such a soft spectrum has been observed in the persistent emission of sgrs only during the `` quiescent '' ( burst - quiet ) phases of and ( kouvelioutou et al .",
    "2003 ; kulkarni et al . 2003 ; mereghetti et al .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of the quiescent x - ray counterpart of ( see  [ rosat ] and  [ spectra ] ) is far too soft for an sgr , while resemble the pre - outburst spectrum of the transient axp ( gotthelf et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the name came from the strong bursting activity ( see e.g. enoto et al . 2009 ; aptekar et al .",
    "2009 ) which led to its discovery .",
    "however , bursts as bright and numerous as those observed from this source and other sgrs , have recently been observed from the axp e in january 2009 ( gronwall et al .",
    "2009 ; savchenko et al .",
    "2009 ; von kienlin & connaughton 2009 ) , which emitted bursts as powerful as a typical sgr intermediate flares ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "another piece of evidence for the axp - like behaviour of , and the sgr - like behaviour of e is the photon index of the variable hard x - ray component . as shown in ",
    "[ spectra ] the photon index we measure from the _ integral _ spectrum is @xmath56 , which is close to the one reported for axps , while the variable hard x - ray emission during the january 2009 outburst of e has a photon index of @xmath57 ( den hartog et al .",
    "2009 ) , typical of sgrs .",
    "thanks to the unprecedented prompt observational campaigns of _ xmm  newton _ , _ integral _ , and _ swift _ , we were able to study in great detail the evolution of the first recorded outburst from the first new sgr discovered in a decade , .",
    "furthermore , we could compare its outburst properties with its quiescent emission as seen by _",
    "rosat_. we found the following .    * phase - connected timing analysis of the entire x - ray outburst of , strongly argue that this source is a magnetar candidate with a magnetic field of @xmath58gauss .",
    "furthermore , we identified a negative second period derivative of @xmath59 = -1.6(4)@xmath310@xmath4s s@xmath5 which implies that the spin - down rate is decreasing with time , possibly in its way to recovering to its secular pre - outburst spin - down . *",
    "a variable hard x - ray component was detected at the beginning of the outburst ( see fig.[figspecxmmintegral ] ) , and became undetectable by _ integral _ some time within 10days after the on - set of the bursting activity .",
    "this represent the first detection of a variable hard x - ray component in a magnetar over such a short timescale . * the phase - connection of all the observations allowed us to study the evolution in time of the phase - resolved spectra .",
    "we found that on top of a phase - averaged spectral softening during the outburst decay , with the bb component decaying on a slower timescale than the pl component ( see fig.[3dpulsenergy ] ) , the spectral evolution also changes from phase to phase .",
    "the main peak of the pulse profile is dominated by the thermal component , while many other sub - peaks are present in the profiles , which are dominated instead by the non - thermal component ( see fig.[dsp ] ) . *",
    "no transient optical / ultraviolet source was detected by the optical monitor on board of _ xmm  newton _ ( see  [ obsom ] ) .",
    "note that the optical counterpart to this source ( tanvir et al .",
    "2008 ; fatkhullin et al .",
    "2008 ) is too faint to be observable by the om , but we could constrain that no counterpart to the x - ray bursts have been observed with @xmath60 22.05 . * from a comparison with other outbursts recently detected from sgrs and axps ( see fig.[figoutbursts ] ) , we show that contrary to other sources , in the first 160days of its outburst , shows a clear exponential decay on a rather slow timescale of about 24days ( see fig.[phase ] ) . *",
