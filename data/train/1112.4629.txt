    "since the beginning of accelerator physics , mass spectroscopy has been playing a leading role in the discovery of particle and resonance states , and understanding of the fundamental interactions in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "for example , the first signals of charm and bottom quarks were in fact detected through the formation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bound states .",
    "on the other hand , current colliders like the lhc , or the ilc in a farther future , will likely continue this discovery program beyond the sm .",
    "it is conceivable that new ( super ) heavy bound states can be formed and , contrary to e.g. the toponium system , their basic constituents are prevented from decaying before the binding is effective .",
    "the goal of this paper is to perfom a prospective study of the spectroscopy of such exotic massive states , by making several reasonable assumptions about the interacting potential among the new - physics constituents which may differ from standard qcd .",
    "furthermore , we will estimate leptonic decay widths of very heavy bound states by making specific assumptions on the quantum numbers of constituents , although not in a comprehensive way .      during the last years , minimal extensions of the sm containing additional heavy particles charged under a new unbroken non - abelian gauge group @xmath2 with fermions _",
    "q,@xmath3 _ have been proposed under the general name of @xmath4hidden valley ",
    "models @xcite , which is a very general scenario containing such heavy particles but as well new sectors of lightweight particles to be observed . in these models",
    "all sm particles would be neutral under such the new @xmath2 group , while new particles charged under @xmath2 but neutral under the sm group would show up if large energy scales are probed .",
    "higher dimension operators , induced e.g. by a @xmath5 or a loop involving heavy particles carrying both @xmath6 and @xmath2 charges , should connect both sm and new physics sectors through rather weak interactions .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath2 group corresponds to @xmath7 , the fermions in the fundamental representation have been recently named as @xmath4quirks \" @xcite or iquarks @xcite .",
    "@xcite actually this theory can be viewed as a certain limit of qcd where light quarks are removed and the typical scale @xmath8 where the new interaction becomes strong is much smaller than the heavy flavor masses .",
    "more generally , such kind of scenario can be put in correspondence with a class of @xmath4hidden valley ",
    "models as pointed out in @xcite . in these models ,",
    "quirks are defined to be new massive fermions transforming under both @xmath6 and a general ( not only @xmath9 ) non - abelian gauge group @xmath2 .",
    "it has been considered so far in the literature that @xmath8 is smaller than @xmath10 , but as well the particular case of hidden valleys with quirks in which @xmath8 is greater than @xmath10 has been studied in the literature @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the name of _ infracolour _ is used to design of the new gluonic degrees of freedom when @xmath8 is much smaller than the quirk mass ; in this work we will refer to it as i - colour ( i - qcd ) in correspondence with the name quirk .",
    "in this section we will focus on the bound states of quirks .",
    "the phenomenology of such bound states has first studied in @xcite , and later an analysis on the spectroscopy of these systems was done by the authors of @xcite .",
    "+ it is well - known that the large mass of the top quark in the sm prevents toponium to be formed since the constituents quarks would decay away too fast .",
    "a criterion for existence of such bound states is that the binding energy should be larger than the total decay width . for heavy onia states beyond the sm ,",
    "however , the situation could be different .",
    "in particular , in the case of quirks @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , its decay is prevented from the conservation of a quantum number .",
    "regarding the dynamics of these quirks , according to @xcite , one can distinguish among three possible energy scales : the first one is the @xmath11 range , where the quirk strings are macroscopic ; the mesoscopic strings can be find at the range @xmath12 ( which is large compared to the atomic scales ) ; and finally we find the microscopic scale at @xmath13 .",
    "+ on the other hand , assuming that the scale of i - colour is below the weak scale , bound states of the new sector are kinematically accessible to present and future collider experiments .",
    "however , since the sm particles are uncharged under i - colour , ( quirk ) loops would be required to couple both sectors leading to highly supressed production rates . moreover , from reference @xcite , quirks are defined to be charged under ( some ) gauge groups of the sm ( for example , charged under the electroweak interaction ) quirks could be pair produced through electroweak processes .",
    "+ likewise , in ref.@xcite quirks are considered as vectors with respect to the electroweak gauge group without carrying qcd colour , but carrying i - colour charge .",
    "therefore notice that there is no yukawa coupling between the higgs boson and quirks .",
    "thus we discard the possible binding force which has been postulated for ultraheavy quarkonium taking over gluon - exchange . at this point , for the sake of clarity , it must be stressed that , taking simple assumptions , through this work we will focus on the case of uncoloured quirks .",
    "+ in this scenario , quirks can be copiously pair - produced at the lhc not through qcd interactions but via electromagnetic and electroweak interactions . as quirks",
    "would be long - lived particles as compared to the collider / detection time scale , different detection strategies can be undertaken according to the possible aforementioned micro , meso or macroscopic regimes .",
    "+ finally , notice that possible quirky signals of folded supersymmetry in colliders have been studied in @xcite , focusing on the scalar quirks ( _ squirks _ ) .",
    "contrary to usual supersymmetric partners of quarks , squirks ( choosing a simple scenario ) are expected to be uncolored , but instead charged under a new confining group , equivalent to i - qcd as introduced above .",
    "the study of spectroscopy performed in this paper is actually not sensitive to possible scalar nature of new fermions , and the main lines could be applicable to squirkonium as well .",
    "according to @xcite , when the quirk pair is produced an excited bound state can be formed with invariant mass given approximately by the total center of momentum energy of the hard partonic scattering giving raise to the pair . in the microscopic regime this bound state would loose energy by emitting i - glueballs and bremsstrahlung towards low - lying states .",
    "once they loose most of their kinetic energy these bound states ( to be dubbed quirkonium ) could decay via electroweak interaction .",
    "however , it is also possible other scenario in which the neutral and colourless quirk pair might have a prompt annihilation before they can loose energy enough to form the low lying quirkonium state .",
    "however , due to the non perturvative nature of the mechanisms it is difficult to estimate in advance the proportion of the events falling in each scenario , and therefore the possibility to detect these low lying states can not be discarded . through this work , in particular we will focus on neutral bound states which can decay , e.g. to final - state dileptons , providing a clean signature even admits a huge hadronic background as at the lhc experiments .",
    "+ new particles with a mass of up to several hundred gev can be pair copiously produced at the lhc .",
    "one expects that quirks will be in general produced with kinetic energy quite larger than @xmath8 .",
    "a significant fraction of this energy should be lost by emission of photons and i - glueballs prior to pair - annihilation .",
    "the two quirks will fly off back - to - back , developing a i - qcd string or flux tube . in usual qcd with light matter",
    "the string is broken up promptly by creating light quark - antiquark pair ; in i - qcd this mechanism is practically absent .",
    "the two heavy ends of the string would continue to move apart , eventually stopping once all the kinetic energy was stored in the string .",
    "the quirks would be then pulled together by the string beginning an oscillatory motion .",
    "most examples of late - decaying particles that have been addressed in the literature yield missing energy , while quirks would annihilate into visible energy in most modes .",
    "besides , as explained in @xcite and @xcite , only i - colour singlet states could be observed .",
    "as commented before , in a optimistic scenario , the excited bound state will emit i - glueballs and bremsstrahlung , towards low - lying states ; then they would annihilate into a hard final state : di - lepton , di - jet , or di - photon .",
    "+ if we want to investigate whether or not it is possible to disentangle different state levels under the assumption of a given ( large ) quirk mass and a specific form of new i - colour interaction , then we could focus on a dimuon signal from the annihilation of a _ narrow _ resonance , since it is the most promising channel @xcite ; it then becomes crucial if the level spacing of different @xmath14-wave states is enough to the foreseen mass resolution based on invariant mass reconstruction from a dimuon system .    according to the reference @xcite the detection of bound states at hadron colliders",
    "is reliable because the signal production is strong and peaked in invariant mass , and the dominant background is electroweak and diffuse . on the other hand ,",
    "dimuon backgrounds from sources other than drell - yan can be suppressed by requiring no extra hard jets or missing energy . besides",
    ", at the lhc , trigger and detector efficiencies are expected to be very high for high - mass dimuon events .",
    "+ concerning other channels , it is expected that quirkonium annihilation into a electron pair could be also a useful signal since the invariant mass peak is expected to yield a similar peak to dimuon but smaller and wider due to detector effects .",
    "on the other hand , in the squirkonium case , according to the reference @xcite the radiative decay ( by soft radiation ) from the highly excited states to the ground state can be ultimately detected by means of unclustered soft fotons in the uncolored case .",
    "also , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is pointed out the possibility to use the invariant mass peak of @xmath15photon , since this channel dominates the squirkonium annhilation at or near the ground state . if necessary , all these signals could aid to distinguish among different states .",
    "+ focusing again on the dimuon signal , as it can be seen from atlas and cms reports @xcite,@xcite one can consider a @xmath16 accuracy for the transverse momentum of muons even at high momentum . since the dimuon invariant mass should coincide to a good approximation , for small ( pseudo)rapidities , with the transverse momentum error , @xmath17 ( since @xmath18 ) ; letting @xmath19 vary along the range @xmath20 $ ] gev , the mass resolution should roughly take the values along the interval @xmath21 $ ] gev .",
    "hereafter we restrict our analysis to the range of @xmath8 given by @xmath22 but in the microscopic regime , namely @xmath23    as is well - known long ago , a non - relativistic treatment of the potential for conventional heavy quarkonium has proved to be suitable on account of the asymptotic freedom of qcd . moreover",
    ", one distinguishes between short- and long - distance dynamics of constituents in the bound state leading to an effective ( static ) potential of the type : @xmath24 in particular we will write @xmath25 where the first term with @xmath26 would correspond to a coulombic interaction , and the second one with @xmath27 to a linear confining interaction .    in this work",
    "we will consider firstly a coulomb plus linear potential ( cpl ) with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; later we will use a more general coulomb plus power law potential ( cpp ) with @xmath26 and @xmath28 as tentative possibilities .",
    "the motivation for the insertion of these power law potentials comes up from the clasical studies of quarkonia ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "in which are considered coulomb like , linear and cornell potentials , but as well the power law potentials are taken into account in order to cover possible deviations from them .",
    "in this way and focusing on the case of quirkonium , in reference @xcite a pure linear potential is taken into account , in reference @xcite a coulomb - like potential were considered . therefore tracking the same philosophy than in the quarkonia case possible deviations",
    "are also considered within this study .",
    "moreover , the interaction accounting for the above static potential can be parameterized by the fermion ( quirk ) mass @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and an additional @xmath31 gauge coupling ( @xmath32 stands for the i - colour number ) which can be related with a i - colour scale @xmath8 .",
    "in this work we will specify @xmath33 in eq.([eq : potential2 ] ) as @xmath34 to be interpreted as cpl ( @xmath27 ) and cpp ( @xmath28 ) potentials . here",
    "@xmath35 corresponds to the i - color string tension and we have introduced a i - color coupling @xmath36 , alongside a group theory factor @xmath37 , in close analogy to qcd potential models ; hence , making a simple assumption , such group factor is taken as a mirror from qcd potentials ( @xmath38 ) and included into the infracolour coupling : i.e. , in calculations we set @xmath39 .",
    "of course , other numerical choices for @xmath37 can be done , but @xmath36 depends on the @xmath8 scale which is actually uncertain as we shall discuss later .",
    "+ on the other hand , in analogy to conventional qcd - inspired potential models , the i - colour string tension can be interpreted as a linear energy density ( @xmath40 ) , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "hence the relation @xmath43 is expected to remain ( approximately ) valid , likewise the equivalent qcd expression @xmath44 ( also derived from lattice calculations @xcite ) , and finally    @xmath45 ^ 2\\ \\sigma_{s}\\ ] ]    in other words , a proportionality depending on the respective @xmath8 and @xmath10 between both string tensions could be expected from the above arguments .",
    "basically , eq.([sigmalambda ] ) implies that @xmath35 and @xmath8 parameters are not independent of each other . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the unknown proportionality factor will be set equal to unity , so that by fixing @xmath8 one gets @xmath35 ( for given @xmath10 and @xmath46 values ) .",
    "focusing on the @xmath8 scale , in this work in principle it corresponds to the microscopic @xmath47 scale depicted in ref.@xcite . numerically speaking ,",
    "as it will be seen , the values of @xmath8 were taken below and above of the qcd scale in a bandwidth ; i.e. @xmath48 with @xmath49 to take into account the uncertainity about this quantity . in this way , the equation([sigmalambda ] ) can be regarded as a comparison between the strength of the linear potential in both sectors @xmath50 and the new gauge group @xmath51 , and it is intended to be an ansatz or a hint to determine numerically a proportionality between @xmath52 and @xmath35 , in which subsequently the numerical uncertainity about the proportionality factor is diluted , taking into account the lack of knowledge about @xmath8 . besides , this comparison between diferent theories can be viewed to some extent in a similar way than in classical physics , in which the strength of gravitational and the electrostatic forces are compared .",
    "+ concerning the i - colour coupling constant , @xmath36 , it would be related with @xmath8 ; as we are dealing with a non - abelian i - colour binding force it implies @xmath36 is scale dependent .",
    "we will compute @xmath36 value at the running scale @xmath53 according to @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath32 is the i - colour number , and @xmath55 the number of quirk generation at the running scale . from eq.([sigmalambda ] ) and eq.([eq : alpha_s ] ) , one can see that both parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are depending on @xmath8 , so that they are not independent quantities .",
    "nonetheless , all those constraints have to be taken with a grain of salt and one should consider as well values deviating from those given in eqs .",
    "( [ sigmalambda ] - [ eq : alpha_s ] ) , as we will see later .    in case of more quirk generations ,",
    "additional active quirk should be taken into account at different energy scale thresholds . nevertheless",
    ", for the sake of simplicity , and in view of still many unknowns in the different models , we will assume @xmath56 and @xmath57 throughout this work .",
    "+ as previously mentioned , we consider that the quirk mass lies in the range @xmath58",
    ". therefore one can reasonably expect that the bound system indeed meets a truly non - relativistic regime , i.e. the relative quirk velocity @xmath59 in the center of mass frame being substantially smaller than the value for bottomonium ( @xmath60 ) . focusing on quirkonium , a formal derivation of such non - relativistic limit from the relativistic degrees of freedom can be found in @xcite ; besides according to reference @xcite and @xcite , the bound state is formed in a highly excited state then it decays to the lower states loosing the main part of its kinetic energy .",
    "therefore it is expected that in the lower levels near to the ground state this kinetic energy could be low enough to assume a non - relativistic aproximation . also , as we shall see later , the numerical results obtained for the expected quirk velocity @xmath61 in the com frame justify this approximation .",
    "since we are interested to perform spectroscopy for very heavy non - relativistic bound states , the schrdinger radial equation must be solved : in a analytical way it could be done by means of a expansion of the quirkonium wave function in a complete basis ; nevertheless here we will choose to solve it numerically , and therefore one should expect that the method to get the resulting mass spectroscopy followed in the _ qq - onia _ package @xcite based on the resolution of the schrdinger radial equation using the numerov @xmath62 technique , should work appropriately for our analysis of quirkonium .",
    "however , we are confronted here to the lack of experimental data to set the ground state of quirkonium , in sharp contrast with , e.g. , the bottomonium or charmonium systems .",
    "nevertheless , let us stress that in this work we are here mainly interested in estimating the mass spacing between different state levels rather than their absolute values .",
    "+ as commented in the introduction , new interactions and particles can form very massive bound states . in this section",
    "we show the results for quirk @xmath63 bound state system by sweeping through the scale range , @xmath64 characterizing the i - colour force .",
    "first we will look at the results using a coulomb plus linear potential ( cpl ) ( with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) ; later using a coulomb plus power law potential ( cpp ) ( with @xmath26 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "concerning the quirk mass , first we use @xmath65 gev , and later @xmath66 gev as representative values ( nevertheless in some calculations we will take additional values ) .",
    "the energy levels , @xmath67 shown in tables correspond to @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) is the quirkonium mass level . in all cases",
    ", we set the ground state to be @xmath71 . besides as relevant calculations we will display also the squared radial wave function at the origin ( wfo ) ( or their derivatives ) , the size of each quirkonium level , and the mean value of the relative quirk velocity @xmath59 in their center of mass frame , since it is used in some calculations @xcite ; besides , the obtained velocities will check the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "let us start by considering the cpl potential .",
    "all tables cited in this and successive sections can be found in appendix .",
    "results for the quirkonium spectrum with @xmath73 gev and @xmath74 mev are shown in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "the corresponding parameters are @xmath75 and @xmath76 . concerning the mean radius , for the ground state we find a size similar to the bohr radius @xmath77 , and increases for higher states as expected up to @xmath78 ; moreover , with these parameters we can found ( @xmath79 ) states with sizes beyond @xmath80 , which is in accordance with @xmath81 .",
    "the quirk velocity in the com frame @xmath82 slowly increasing with the @xmath83 and @xmath84 quantum numbers ; these low @xmath59 values plainly justify the non relativistic regime resulting from the qq - onia package .",
    "+ we provide the squared wfo and derivatives divided by powers of the quirk mass obtained in our calculations , following the same behaviour with @xmath83 and @xmath84 as found in standard quarkonium ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) . from the ground state wfo value we realize that @xmath85 state follows mainly a coulombic behaviour @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for higher resonances , for the p states case we find that a coulombic ( derivative ) wfo underestimates the numerical value obtained from this potential .",
    "let us stress that the energy level spacing ( notably between s - wave resonances , of order of tens of mev ) would not permit the experimental discrimination by using the dimuon annihilation channel ( and likely any other else ) .",
    "table [ table:2 ] shows the results for @xmath86 ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "the @xmath89 level spacings turn out to be somewhat larger than in the previous case but still not enough to permit experimental discrimination .",
    "something similar can be expected for @xmath90 mev as can be seen from table [ table:3 ] , with ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) . here",
    "we find lower values for sizes of resonances with respect to previous case ( as expected since @xmath8 increases ) .",
    "besides , we observe a wfo value for the ground state somewhat greater than the expected for a coulombic behaviour .    the results shown in table [ table:4 ] ( appendix ) corresponds to the microscopic scale @xmath93 .",
    "here @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "the string tension turns to be much stronger than in the qcd case .",
    "the energy levels reach the gev scale and the wfo grow to the @xmath96 gev@xmath97 values ; according with previous trend the corresponding derivatives are growing also .",
    "the wfo value for the lowest state is @xmath98 times greater than the expected for a coulombic behaviour .",
    "concerning the level spacing this case is interesting since values among @xmath14-wave states turns out to be of order of @xmath99 gev , likely enough to be disentangled .",
    "we now set the quirk mass equal to 500 gev , so quirkonium mass is of order of the tev scale . in table",
