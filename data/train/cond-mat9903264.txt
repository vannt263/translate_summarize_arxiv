    ", the asymptotics as @xmath123 still requires a scaling relation of the kind @xmath124 ( with @xmath103 constant ) , namely @xmath125 we recognize that for @xmath126 the model ( rw2 ) exhibits a smooth scaling law but a discontinuity is present at @xmath25 as can be seen by taking the limit as @xmath127 this allows us to recover for @xmath25 the gaussian model ( 3.2)-(3.3 ) , but it shows that in numerical practice when @xmath0 is near 2 the convergence is expected to be slow .",

    "indeed we obtain @xmath142 @xmath143 the asymptotic behaviour of the stable densities is the starting point for the random walk model ( rw3 ) in that , following gillis & weiss @xcite , we require that all @xmath47 for @xmath144 are proportional to @xmath145 however , the simplicity of the starting point leads to difficulties for treating this model since the generating function is no longer elementary , a fact that makes the convergence proof a really hard affair .",
    "we need to recall the following special functions @xmath146 respectively known as the riemann _ zeta _ function and the _ polylogarithmic _ function .",
    "this model has been extensively discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where the following generating function is derived @xmath147\\,.\\eqno(3.14)\\ ] ] here @xmath148 so @xmath149 is by its power series also defined on the periphery @xmath150 of the unit circle .",

    "nevertheless , through the scaling relation ( 3.16 ) , this random walk converges to the continuous gaussian process .",
    "thus this model gives us the opportunity to verify that a random walk with infinite variance steps may ( slowly ) converge to the gaussian , in agreement with a general theorem on the domain of attraction of the normal law , see @xcite .",
    "in general the random walk models are not only valuable from the conceptual point of view for visualizing what the diffusion means but also for numerical calculations , either as monte carlo simulation of particle paths in a diffusion process or as discrete imitation of the process in form of redistribution ( from one time level to the next ) of clumps of an extensive quantity ( across the spatial grid points ) .",
    "our models can be used in at least three different ways : @xmath155 as _ finite difference schemes _ for approximate calculation of symmetric stable densities ; @xmath156 for producing _",
    "sample paths _ of individual particles performing the random walk ; @xmath157 for producing _ histograms _ of the approximate realization of the densities @xmath158 by simulating many individual paths with the same number of time steps and making statistics of the final positions of the particles .    for numerical simulations of stable random variables",
    "different algorithms have been provided by a number of specialists , including chambers _",
    "et al _ @xcite , bartels @xcite , mantegna @xcite , janicki & weron @xcite , samorodnitsky & taqqu @xcite .",
    "our present approach for treating lvy statistics has been carried out independently from all the above references but uniquely based on the random walk models presented here , so , as far as we know , our results would be in the great part original .",
    "having preliminarily checked a sufficient level of accuracy for our finite difference schemes with the existing tables of stable densities , here we present some results on the simulation of the sample paths and histograms corresponding to some typical values of the index of stability , namely @xmath159 in practice , in our numerical studies there is required truncation in two ways .",
    "it is impossible to simulate all infinitely many discrete probabilities , so the size of possible jumps must be limited to a maximal possible jump length .",
    "the other truncation is required if a priori one wants a definite region of space to be considered in which the walk takes place .",
    "then , particles leaving this space have been ignored .",
    "our simulations , based on one million of realizations , have been carried out in the interval @xmath160 all the histograms refer to stable densities at @xmath161 for @xmath162 the space interval being reduced to avoid the border effects .",
    "the sample paths are plotted against the time steps , up to 1200 for @xmath26 and up to 2000 for @xmath163 so they refer to different final times , namely @xmath164 respectively .",
    "the transition probabilities have been chosen from our random walk models as follows : @xmath26 from ( rw2 ) , see ( 3.10 ) , with scaling parameter @xmath165 ; @xmath166 from ( rw1 ) , see ( 3.5b ) , with @xmath167 for @xmath168 from the standard model , see ( 3.2 ) , with @xmath169 the cases @xmath26 ( cauchy process ) and @xmath25 ( normal process ) have been considered for a possible comparison with the standard and accurate algorithms existing in the literature , whereas @xmath170 has been chosen in view of possible applications in econophysics where usually the index of stability ranges from 1.4 to 1.7 , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for the simulation of markovian processes characterized by symmetric lvy probability densities evolving in time we have presented three different random walk models , discrete in space and time , by giving their respective transition probabilities .",
    "we have indicated how , by use of generating functions , convergence for properly scaled transition to vanishing steps of space and time can be analyzed , and we have hinted at peculiarities occurring at the particular stability indices @xmath26 ( the cauchy process ) and @xmath25 ( the gauss process ) .",
    "we have displayed preliminary results of a few numerical case studies concerning sample paths and histograms to check the efficiency of our algorithms . from the sample paths one can recognize the `` wild '' character of the lvy flights with respect to the `` tame '' character of the brownian motion .",
    "we expect that our arguments can be relevant in different fields of physics including the emerging one of econophysics , where stable distributions are becoming more common . in statistical physics",
    "the stable distributions play a key role in the ( wonderful ) world of random walks constructed by the late montroll and continued through his school , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also tsallis and his associates have recognized the key role of stable distributions with respect to a generalized theory of thermostatics , see @xcite , and references therein",
    ". here , we have ( only briefly ) pointed out the relation between lvy statistics and space - fractional diffusion equations .",
    "however , stable distributions turn out to be related also with time - fractional diffusion equations , see @xcite . furthermore",
