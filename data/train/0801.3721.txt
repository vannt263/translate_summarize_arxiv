    "special lagrangian submanifolds in calabi ",
    "yau @xmath3-folds have received much attention in recent years , as they are key ingredients in the strominger  yau  zaslow conjecture @xcite , which explains mirror symmetry of calabi - yau 3-folds .",
    "thomas and yau @xcite defined a notion of stability for graded lagrangians @xmath4 in a calabi ",
    "yau @xmath3-fold @xmath5 , and conjectured that if @xmath4 is stable then the _ lagrangian mean curvature flow _ of @xmath4 exists for all time and converges to a special lagrangian submanifold @xmath6 in @xmath5 , which should be the unique special lagrangian in the hamiltonian equivalence class of  @xmath4 .    rewriting this in terms of the derived fukaya category @xmath7 of @xmath5 , as in kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry programme @xcite , and using bridgeland s notion of stability condition on triangulated categories @xcite , one can state an improved ( but still over - simplified ) version of the thomas  yau conjecture as follows : for any calabi ",
    "yau @xmath3-fold @xmath5 , there should exist a bridgeland stability condition @xmath8 on @xmath9 depending on the holomorphic @xmath10-form @xmath11 on @xmath5 , such that a graded lagrangian @xmath4 in @xmath5 is @xmath12-stable , regarded as an object in @xmath9 , if and only if the lagrangian mean curvature flow of @xmath4 exists for all time and converges to a special lagrangian submanifold @xmath6 in @xmath5 , which should be unique in the isomorphism class of @xmath4 in @xmath7 . a related method for constructing special lagrangians by minimizing volume amongst lagrangians using geometric measure theory was proposed by schoen and wolfson  @xcite .    to carry these programmes through to their conclusion",
    "will require a deep understanding of lagrangian mean curvature flow , and of the possible singularities that can occur during it in finite time .",
    "singularities in lagrangian mean curvature flow are generally locally modelled on _ soliton solutions _ , such as lagrangians in @xmath1 which are moved by rescaling or translation by mean curvature flow .",
    "there are two important results in this area .",
    "the first one is due to wang @xcite , who observed that mean curvature flow for almost calibrated lagrangians in calabi ",
    "yau @xmath3-folds can not develop type i singularities . and",
    "the second one is due to neves @xcite , who ( loosely ) proved that singularities of such flows are modelled to leading order on special lagrangian cones when applying central blow up near the singularities .    in this paper , we construct many examples of self - similar solutions and translating solitons for lagrangian mean curvature flow .",
    "our lagrangians @xmath4 in @xmath1 are the total space of a 1-parameter family @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an open interval in @xmath16 , and each @xmath13 is a quadric in a lagrangian plane @xmath0 in @xmath1 , which evolve according to an o.d.e .  in @xmath17 .",
    "the construction includes and generalizes examples of lagrangian solitons or special lagrangians due to anciaux @xcite , joyce @xcite , lawlor @xcite , and lee and wang  @xcite .",
    "the authors believe that two of our families of examples may have particular significance for future work on lagrangian mean curvature flow .",
    "firstly , in theorems c and d of  [ lm32 ] , we show that if @xmath18 are transverse lagrangian planes in @xmath1 and the sum of characteristic angles of @xmath18 is less than @xmath2 , and @xmath19 , then we can construct a unique closed , embedded lagrangian self - expander @xmath4 with rate @xmath20 diffeomorphic to @xmath21 and asymptotic to @xmath22 .",
    "these examples could be used as local models for surgeries during lagrangian mean curvature flow .    as in the ricci flow proof of the poincar conjecture @xcite",
    ", it seems likely that to get long - time existence for lagrangian mean curvature flow , it will be necessary to allow the flow to develop singularities , and continue the flow after a surgery which changes the topology of the lagrangian .",
    "research by the first author ( unpublished ) indicates that an important condition in the improved thomas  yau conjecture described above is that the lagrangians should have _ unobstructed lagrangian floer homology _",
    ", in the sense of fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite .",
    "but mean curvature flow amongst nonsingular , immersed lagrangians can cross ` walls ' , on the other side of which lagrangian floer homology is obstructed . when this happens , the correct thing to do is to do a surgery , and glue in a lagrangian self - expander from theorems c and  d.    secondly , in corollary i of  [ lm34 ] we give an explicit family of closed , embedded lagrangian translating solitons @xmath4 in @xmath1 for @xmath23 , which are diffeomorphic to @xmath0 , and asymptotic in a weak sense to a union @xmath22 of lagrangian planes @xmath24 in @xmath1 , with @xmath25 .",
    "the oscillation of the lagrangian angle of @xmath4 can be chosen arbitrarily small .",
    "if these examples can arise as local models for finite time singularities for lagrangian mean curvature flow , they may represent a kind of bad behaviour , which could cause difficulties with the thomas  yau programme even in dimension  2 .    as well as these two families ,",
    "we construct new examples of compact , immersed lagrangian self - shrinkers in @xmath1 diffeomorphic to @xmath26 , of closed , immersed lagrangian self - expanders and self - shrinkers diffeomorphic to @xmath27 for @xmath28 , of non - closed , immersed lagrangian self - expanders diffeomorphic to @xmath29 for @xmath30 , of non - closed , immersed lagrangian self - shrinkers diffeomorphic to @xmath29 for @xmath28 , and of closed , embedded lagrangian translating solitons diffeomorphic to @xmath0 with infinite oscillation of the lagrangian angle .",
    "these examples include those of anciaux @xcite and lee and wang @xcite , and approach the special lagrangians of joyce @xcite and lawlor @xcite in a limit .",
    "we begin in  [ lm2 ] with some background material .",

    "mean curvature vector _ points in the direction in which the volume decreases most rapidly . _ mean curvature flow _ deforms the submanifold in the direction of the mean curvature vector .",
    "as special lagrangians are volume minimizing , it is natural to use mean curvature flow to construct special lagrangians . equation implies that mean curvature flow is a lagrangian deformation , that is , a lagrangian submanifold remains lagrangian under mean curvature flow , as in smoczyk  @xcite .",

    "are those moved by scaling or translation in euclidean space .",
    "we recall that solitons moved by scaling must be of the form :    a submanifold @xmath4 in euclidean space @xmath0 is called a _ self - similar solution _ if @xmath48 on @xmath4 for some constant @xmath20 in @xmath16 , where @xmath49 is the projection of the position vector @xmath50 in @xmath0 to the normal bundle of @xmath4 , and @xmath51 is the mean curvature vector of @xmath4 in @xmath0 .",
