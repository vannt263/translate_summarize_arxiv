    "nrqcd@xcite has now become a basic theory to parameterize non - perturbative contributions in heavy quarkonium production and decays by color - singlet(cs ) and color - octet(co ) matrix elements .",
    "it defines the `` velocity scaling rules '' to order various matrix elements by @xmath3 , the relative velocity of heavy quarks in the rest frame of heavy quarkonium .",
    "although nrqcd has already achieved a lot in the study of heavy quarkonium physics , there are still some unsettled issues remaining , especially , in aspect of production mechanism @xcite , for instance , the role of color - octet in charmonium production .",
    "the color - octet scheme is a central essence of nrqcd , which supplies a way to partly understand the prompt @xmath1 and @xmath4 surplus production at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , and supplies a consistent differential cross section spectrum , versus the transverse momentum @xmath0 , with experimental results @xcite .",
    "however , there are still something unclear in this scheme , which ask for further effort . in electron - positron collision ,",
    "the former crises in @xmath1 exclusive @xcite and inclusive production @xcite are somehow going to an end with the advent of the next - to - leading order(nlo ) qcd @xcite and relativistic correction results @xcite . in charmonium photoproduction",
    ", the recent nlo qcd calculation tells that to reproduce the full hera experimental results , the color - singlet contribution alone seems not enough @xcite . in charmonium hadroproduction , recent computations of nlo qcd corrections @xcite",
    "significantly enhance the @xmath1 color - singlet yield in large transverse momentum region and alter its polarization prediction in lo calculation .",
    "hence , the nlo @xmath1 hadroproduction result in cs scheme greatly minimize the contribution through color - octet mechanism , which in some sense agrees with the hypotheses given in ref.@xcite . for more detailed discussion on these issues",
    ", readers can refer to recent review articles , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "to further investigate charmonium production mechanism keeps on being an urgent and important task in the study of quarkonium physics .",
    "the running of the lhc supplies a great opportunity to this aim . with a luminosity of about @xmath5 and center of mass energy @xmath6 tev",
    ", lhc will produce copious data of charmonium inclusive and exclusive production , which can in principle answer the question : to what extent the color - octet mechanism plays a role in @xmath7 production ?",
    "as noted by cho and wise that the direct @xmath7 production via color - octet mechanism should be mostly transversely polarized at leading order in @xmath8 , which may stand as a unique test to the quarkonium production mechanism @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider the process of polarized @xmath1 pair production at lhc , and suggest to test the charmonium production mechanism through it .",
    "the same process but in unpolarized case was proposed and calculated by barger _ et al_. @xcite and qiao @xcite once for tevatron experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we set up the formalism for the computation of polarized @xmath7 hadroproduction , in both color - singlet and -octet schemes . in section iii ,",
    "the numerical results for the lhc first - year and later runs are provided .",
    "the section iv is remained for a brief summary and conclusions . for the convenience of readers ,",
    "the relevant analytic expressions are given in the appendix .",
    "pair production in @xmath9 collision at leading order in color - singlet scheme.,width=245,height=188 ]",
    "in color - singlet model , the partonic subprocesses start at order @xmath10 , which include @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "intuitively , the latter , the quark - antiquark annihilation process , is possibly negligible in comparison with the former since the lhc is a proton - proton collision machine . to confirm this point , the quark - antiquark process is also evaluated in this work and the numerical result is given in table [ ratio1 ] .",
    "hence , in the following analysis we will mainly focus on the gluon - gluon process as shown in figure [ graph1 ] , and the analytic results of it are presented in the appendix .    for @xmath13 color - singlet hadronization , we employ the following commonly used projection operator @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath1 polarization vector with @xmath16 , @xmath17 stands for the unit color matrix , and @xmath18 .",
    "the nonperturbative parameter , @xmath19 , is the schrdinger wave function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 system at the origin for @xmath1 , and @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the radial wave function at the origin . in our calculation , the non - relativistic relation @xmath24 is adopted , and hereafter , for simplicity @xmath25 will be denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath1 pair hadroproduction reads as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the parton densities ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the rapidity of the two produced @xmath1s . the partonic scattering process , the gluon - gluon to polarized @xmath1 pair @xmath32 , can be calculated in the standard method . to manipulate the trace and matrix - element - square for those diagrams shown in figure [ graph1 ] ,",
    "the computer algebra system mathematica is employed with the help of the package feyncalc and feynarts @xcite .",
    "the lengthy expressions for different @xmath1 pair polarizations are presented in the appendix , for the convenience of independent comparison and physical simulation use .",
    "summing over all polarizations , we find an agreement with the unpolarized cross section given in @xcite .    in experiment ,",
    "the @xmath1 polarizations can be determined via measuring the normalized angular distribution @xmath33 of @xmath34 pair in @xmath1 decays .",
    "the correlation of distribution with polarization reads @xcite @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the angle between the @xmath37 direction in the @xmath1 rest frame and the @xmath1 direction in pp center - of - mass frame ; @xmath38 is a convenient measure of the polarization , which is defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are transverse and longitudinal components of the cross section , respectively . for detailed derivation of the relation between polarization measure @xmath38 and decay distribution ,",
    "see , e.g. , the appendix a of ref . @xcite . from the definition",
    ", obviously , @xmath42 corresponds to the transverse polarization , and @xmath43 to the longitudinal polarization .",
    "pair production in @xmath9 collision at leading order in color - octet scheme.,width=491,height=188 ]    in nrqcd , the short - distant contribution can be expanded by @xmath3 .",
    "dynamical gluons enter into fock state , and combine with heavy quark pair to form color octet states .",
    "therefore , wave functions of @xmath1 is represented by @xmath44g\\rangle + \\textsl{o}(v^2)|c\\bar{c}[^3s_1^{(1,8)}]gg\\rangle + \\textsl{o}(v^2)|c\\bar{c}[^1s_0^{(8)}]g\\rangle+ ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the co scheme , at the leading order of @xmath3 , three different co state components @xmath45g\\rangle$ ] , @xmath46gg\\rangle$ ] and @xmath47g\\rangle$ ] may contribute to the double @xmath1 production . in practice , for the sake of simplicity for further analysis",
    ", we classify the intermediate fock states into two clusters : one contains @xmath46gg\\rangle$ ] , the other includes @xmath47g\\rangle$ ] and @xmath45g\\rangle$ ] . in this sense , the double @xmath1 fock states may have following different combinations : @xmath48 \\rangle|c\\bar{c}[^3s_1^{(8)}]gg\\rangle}_{part_1 } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\underbrace{|c\\bar{c}[^3s_1^{(1)}]\\rangle(|c\\bar{c}[^3p_j^{(8)}]g \\rangle+|c\\bar{c}[^1s_0^{(8)}]g\\rangle)}_{part_2}+ \\underbrace{|c\\bar{c}[^3s_1^{(8)}]gg \\rangle|c\\bar{c}[^3s_1^{(8)}]gg\\rangle}_{part_3}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\underbrace{|c\\bar{c}[^3s_1^{(8)}]gg\\rangle(|c\\bar{c}[^3p_j^{(8)}]g \\rangle+|c\\bar{c}[^1s_0^{(8)}]g\\rangle)}_{part_4}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\underbrace{(|c\\bar{c}[^3p_j^{(8)}]g\\rangle+|c\\bar{c } [ ^1s_0^{(8)}]g\\rangle)(|c\\bar{c}[^3p_j^{(8)}]g \\rangle+|c\\bar{c}[^1s_0^{(8)}]g\\rangle)}_{part_5 } \\label{state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ state ] ) the leading one indicates the pure color - singlet state , which is discussed in the preceding subsection .",
    "the co states involved components are then divided into five sectors . in small transverse momentum @xmath0 region , where the nrqcd factorization theorem does not work well ,",
    "the five co state related processes would contribute less to the double charmonium production than from the pure cs process due to a suppression in matrix elements of @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "in large @xmath0 region , however , the co contribution , especially from @xmath51gg\\rangle$ ] may exceed what from the cs , because the relative smallness of co matrix elements may be compensated by the enhancement of the large propagators in corresponding processes , which is similar to the case of inclusive @xmath7 production in large transverse momentum region at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "in infinite transverse momentum limit , it is well - known that the process of gluon fragmenting into @xmath51gg\\rangle$ ] will dominate over others in @xmath7 hadroproduction . hence , one may still expect here that in the double @xmath1 exclusive hadroproduction in the large transverse momentum region , the bi - gluon fragmentation would be the most important production mechanism .",
    "however , in moderate transverse momentum case as in lhc experiment , to minimize the uncertainties induced by the fragmentation mechanism we calculate the complete feynman diagrams for co processes instead of fragmentation simplification as shown in figure [ graph2 ] .    for processes involving the co components , that is @xmath52 to @xmath53 in ( [ state ] ) ,",
    "those contribute double @xmath1 production via intermediate states @xmath47g\\rangle$ ] and @xmath45g\\rangle$ ] are obviously negligible in comparison with the cs process as shown in figure [ graph1 ] .",
    "moreover , the @xmath54 involved processes may contribute less than what from @xmath52 processes by @xmath49 , an order . for @xmath55 contribution ,",
    "our explicit numerical calculation shows that it is smaller than what from the cs by about two orders of magnitude in all @xmath0 region . in all",
    ", the meaningful co contribution mainly comes from the @xmath56 involved processes , and which are what we are going to evaluate .    for the @xmath1 intermediate fock state @xmath51gg\\rangle$ ] ,",
    "the projection operator is @xmath57 @xmath58 numerical results -----------------    in numerical calculation , we enforce the lhc experimental condition , the pseudorapidity cut @xmath59 , on the produced charmonium pair .",
    "the cross sections and transverse momentum spectra are evaluated under three conditions : the first one with center - of - mass energy @xmath60 tev , the second one with center - of - mass energy @xmath61 tev , the third one with center - of - mass energy @xmath62 tev , which correspond to the experimental situations of initial and following runs for hadron study at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the planned collisions happen at the lhc with luminosity of @xmath63 in first two cases , and @xmath64 in the third situation . in one year running , @xmath65 effective time , the corresponding integrated luminosities are about @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the input parameters take the values @xcite @xmath68 the typical energy scale in partonic interaction is set to be at @xmath69 , and hence the strong coupling is running with transverse momentum .    with the above formulas and inputs ,",
    "one can readily obtain the polarized @xmath1 pair production rate at the lhc . in our numerical calculation , the parton distribution functions(pdfs ) of cteq5l@xcite is used , and both renormalization scale in strong coupling @xmath8 and factorization scale in pdfs are set to be @xmath70 .",
    "the numerical results for integrated cross section @xmath71 with different @xmath0 lower bounds are presented in table i for the cs production scheme , and table ii for the co scheme , where the the branching fraction of @xmath72 is taken into account .",

    "other co related processes , either single or double co processes , contribute significantly less than those from cs and @xmath52 involved processes in whole transverse momentum region , therefore can be neglected .",
    "result shows that in low transverse momentum region the double @xmath1 yields are governed by the cs process , while the co process may dominate as @xmath82 gev .",
    "the indirect @xmath1 production from the @xmath83 and @xmath4 feed down , according to the analysis of @xcite , may contribute about a factor of 2 to the transverse distribution spectrum of prompt @xmath1 production , while these inclusive yields can be removed in experiment in principle and hence are not taken into account in our analysis .",
    "the calculation performed in this work is at the leading order of strong coupling @xmath8 . due to the relatively high interaction scale in this process ,",
    "higher order qcd corrections should be small .",
    "the `` smallness '' here means that it may not be as big as nlo corrections to some inclusive charmonium production processes recently found .",
    "nevertheless , this is just a naive speculation . for exclusive process , higher order corrections , the virtual corrections , do not change the relative polarization ratio , while is different from nlo correction to the inclusive process where the hard real correction may alter the final state polarization significantly . though higher order relativistic correction is generally large in charmoniun system , while for @xmath1 pair production it will be doubly suppressed .",
    "it is worthy of mentioning that in order to keep the exclusivity of double @xmath1 production and reduce the final state interaction effects , to enforce the transverse momentum cut veto would be a necessary choice , however which may also suppress some useful signals .",
    "the integrated cross sections of double @xmath1 production with different polarizations are found to be measurable theoretically with a lower transverse momentum cut of 7 gev in the first - year run of lhc at colliding energy of 7 tev and luminosity of 1@xmath84 or so , where about one hundred of di - muons from @xmath1 decays will be produced and the total yields from cs and co are comparable . for lower transverse momentum cut higher than @xmath85 gev , the double @xmath1 yield may mainly come from the color - octet scheme , under the circumstance of employing the nowadays prevailing magnitude of color - octet matrix element . at colliding energy of 7 tev",
    ", our calculation result shows that the data with at least one @xmath1 in a pair being longitudinally polarized are nearly fifty percent of the total yield with transverse momentum integration lower cut of 5 gev of produced @xmath1 .",
    "different from the inclusive production , where experimental data show that @xmath1s tend to be unpolarized or even longitudinally polarized with the increase of transverse momentum , in the exclusive pair production both color - singlet and -octet schemes exhibit that the produced @xmath1 data should be always dominated by the transversely polarized yields .",
