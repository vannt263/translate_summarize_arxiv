    "these results provide the first direct evidence that the metallicity gradients in galaxy pairs are systematically different from gradients in isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "recent infall of less enriched gas from the outskirts of the close pair galaxies is the likely culprit .    in @xcite",
    ", we investigate the effect of gas inflows on metallicity gradients in theoretical merger simulations .",
    "we assume the simplest conditions : no ongoing star formation , equal - mass progenitors and small gas mass fractions . in these theoretical models",
    ", we find a dramatic flattening of the initial radial metallicity gradient between first and second pericenter .",
    "this flattening reflects the effects of gas redistribution over the galaxy disks , including both metal - poor inflow and the growth of tidal tails that carry metals out to large radius .",
    "if large merger - triggered gas flows drive the bulk of the inflowing gas into the central kiloparsec , triggering a burst of star formation , a recent nuclear burst of star formation may be associated with a flatter metallicity gradient .",
    "@xcite applied stellar population synthesis models to the b - r colors and balmer equivalent widths of the galaxy pairs sample to derive the fraction of r - band light originating from a recent burst of star formation , termed the central burst strength . in @xcite , we showed that central burst strength correlates strongly with central metallicity in close pairs .",
    "this result is consistent with the theoretical simulations of @xcite , which show that pairs experiencing the strongest bursts of star formation also have the strongest circumnuclear dilution .",
    "if most of the infalling gas is deposited in the central regions , we might expect a correlation between the metallicity gradient slope and central burst strength in our galaxy pairs .",
    "however , we find no statistically significant correlation between the metallicity gradient and the central burst strength ( spearman rank coefficient of -0.14 with a two - sided probability of obtaining this value by chance of 74% ) .",
    "similarly , we find no statistically significant correlation between the metallicity gradient slope and the presence of blue bulges or pair projected separation .",
    "we note that our gradient sample is limited by the small sample size and that a larger sample is required for more robust conclusions on the relationship between the metallicity gradient slope and galaxy properties .",
    "if the lack of correlation between central burst strength and metallicity gradient slope holds for a larger sample , these results would suggest that ( a ) the timescale for a central starburst differs from the timescale over which the metallicity gradient remains disrupted , and/or ( b ) the metallicity gradient slope is strongly influenced by radial gas redistribution along the spiral arms and/or metal outflows , rather than a simple inflow into the central kiloparsec .    the presence of bars is correlated with efficient gas flows toward the nucleus in late - type spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bars may be created in the early stages of a merger @xcite .",
    "two galaxies in our sample have bars ( ugc  312 and ugc  12545 ) .",
    "while ugc  312 has a low central metallicity and relatively flat gradient slope ( @xmath30 ) , ugc  12545 has a steeper gradient slope ( @xmath31 ) that is within the full range of gradient slopes observed in our pairs sample .",
    "it is not clear from these two galaxies whether bars allow more efficient transport of gas towards the central regions during galaxy mergers .",
    "we find no correlation between the distance from the nearby field galaxy lz relation and the close pair metallicity gradient slope .",
    "galaxy pairs that lie close to the field galaxy lz relation in figure  1 may have had high central metallicities [ @xmath19@xmath32 in the @xcite [ ] / [ ]  scale ] prior to the interaction . in @xcite , we investigated the theoretical relationship between the metallicity gradient and central metallicities .",
    "we showed that metallicity gradients become disrupted by the interaction , followed by a dilution in the central metallicity .",
    "the observational results presented here support this scenario .",
    "we present the first systematic study of metallicity gradients in close galaxy pairs .",
    "we find that _ all _ of our galaxy pairs have flatter metallicity gradients than gradients observed in typical isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "these results show that the low central metallicities seen previously in galaxy pairs and interacting galaxies signal a relatively flat metallicity gradient .",
    "we conclude that large gas inflows are responsible for the disruption and flattening of metallicity gradients in close pair galaxies .",
    "evidence for gas flows has been difficult to study in the past , requiring integral field or neutral gas velocity maps .",
    "our results indicate that metallicity gradients provide a unique and feasible method for detecting recent strong tidal gas flows in galaxy interactions and mergers .",
