    "<S> the larger the chaotic fraction of the classical phase space is , the quicker the correlations between quantum momenta at different times decay ( this can be seen from large values of @xmath6 where @xmath88 vanishes even within relatively short windows ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can relate @xmath88 to the regular part of the phase space weighted by the initial wigner distribution @xmath90 of qkr ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wigner_vs_phase_space ] for illustration ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath88 keeps decaying with time , while the regular phase - space fraction is a constant determined by the initial conditions and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , at small @xmath6 , when the phase space is mostly regular , the time - averaged value of the two - point correlator is determined by the initial state alone and almost never decays . as @xmath6 grows , the ratio of regular to chaotic areas of the phase space decreases , and so does the average value of the correlator over a fixed window until it reaches zero at large @xmath6 , when there are practically no regular regions .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S>  _ in this letter we analyze the otoc , @xmath1 , for the celebrated qkr . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath1 grows exponentially for @xmath69 and @xmath24 at the rate ( cgr ) distinct from the corresponding classical lyapunov exponent for this model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that cgr takes positive values even in the regular regime ( @xmath106 ) corresponding to the existence of local disconnected chaotic islands while le vanishes indicating the absence of a fully connected chaotic region in the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this fundamental distinction is primarily due to different order of averaging and taking logarithm to extract the exponent . at long times and @xmath102 , we show that the quantum time - averaged two - point correlator , @xmath88 , reveals the classical regular - to - chaotic transition .    _ acknowledgments . </S>",
