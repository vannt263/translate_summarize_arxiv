    "in fact , they are essential for treating gauge field theories , which govern the fundamental interactions of elementary particles .",
    "up to now we have been considering classical mechanics .",
    "the essential difference between classical and quantum mechanics is heisenberg s uncertainty relation , which implies that in the latter , states can no longer be represented as points in phase space .",

    "physical quantities are then represented by eigenvalues of these operators , and physical states are related to the operator eigenfunctions .",

    "there is no such break when going from the classical system to the corresponding quantum system ; we describe the quantum system by using the same entities that we use to describe the classical system .",
    "the observables of the system are described by the same functions on phase space as their classical counterparts .",
    "uncertainty is realized by describing physical states as distributions on phase space that are not sharply localized , in contrast to the dirac delta functions which occur in the classical case .",

    "the passage from the classical algebra of observables to the quantum algebra of observables is performed in a continuous fashion .",
    "when mathematicians investigate a particular structure , they try to modify it in various ways in order to see how these modifications affect it : which properties are preserved under certain modifications and which properties change .",
    "if the modification changes the structure in a continuous fashion , they speak of a deformation . all work on deformation quantization stems from gerstenhaber s seminal 1964 paper,@xmath46 where he introduced the concept of a star product of smooth functions on a manifold .    for applications to quantum mechanics we consider smooth complex - valued functions on a poisson manifold .",
    "a star product @xmath47 of two such functions is a new smooth function , which , in general , is described by an infinite power series : @xmath48 the first term in the series is the pointwise product given in eq .",
