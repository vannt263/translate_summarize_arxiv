    "<S> we show that spin - flip rotation in a semiconductor quantum wire , caused by the rashba and the dresselhaus interactions ( both of arbitrary strengths ) , can be suppressed by dint of an in - plane magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we found a new type of symmetry , which arises at a particular set of intensity and orientation of the magnetic field and explains this suppression . based on our findings </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a transport experiment to measure the strengths of the rashba and the dresselhaus interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> spin - polarized transport in semiconductor nanostructures is the main topic in spintronics due to great interests to both basic research and device application @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit interactions present in semiconductor structures provide a promising way to spin manipulation in bulk semiconductors @xcite , two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gases @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , these interactions cause decay of spin polarization @xcite , since the spin - orbit coupling breaks the total spin symmetry . the effect of spin relaxation produced by the interplay between the dresselhaus @xcite and rashba @xcite spin - orbit interactions ( rdi ) has been studied in a few publications ( cf.@xcite ) . it was found by schliemann _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite that at zero magnetic field in 2d semiconductor nanostructures for equal strengths of the rdi there is an additional symmetry @xcite . as a consequence , the orbital motion is decoupled from the spin evolution . </S>",
    "<S> if this resonant condition is not active , the spin dynamics is influenced by the different spin relaxation mechanisms related to orbital scattering processes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss another spin symmetry that arises at certain conditions at nonzero magnetic field in the plane and arbitrary strengths of the spin - orbit terms in a quantum wire . in virtue of this symmetry </S>",
    "<S> the spin - flip rotation is suppressed at arbitrary polarization of the injected electrons . by setting these conditions on and off , </S>",
    "<S> the flow of a certain spin polarization through the device is either allowed or destroyed , thus , defining a transistor - like action for the spin .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the conduction band of a 2d semiconductor quantum well within the effective mass approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the wire geometry is defined by a transversal potential @xmath0 : @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the dresselhaus interaction has , in general , a cubic dependence on the momentum of the carriers . for a narrow </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 $ ] quantum well , it reduces to the 2d linear momentum dependent term @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the interaction strength ) . in the asymmetric quantum wells the bychkov - rashba interaction has the form : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the corresponding strength . </S>",
    "<S> our system hamiltonian reads as @xmath7 where we include the effect of the in - plane magnetic field by means of the zeeman interaction @xmath8 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath9 represents the in - plane orientation of the magnetic field with the intensity @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the effective gyromagnetic factor and @xmath12 is the bohr s magneton . </S>",
    "<S> note that none of the interactions break the translational invariance in the longitudinal coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the eigenstates are chosen to have a well - defined longitudinal momentum @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 stand for transversal , longitudinal and spin quantum numbers . as a result , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is transformed to the effective one for the transversal coordinate for a given value of @xmath16 @xmath18.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] two different spin - dependent terms can be distinguished within this hamiltonian ; one is involving the transversal component of the momentum and the other contains the effective zeeman - like term including contributions from the rdi . </S>",
    "<S> if both terms are parallel in the spin space , a symmetry arises and the spin is totally decoupled from the orbital motion . in order to set this symmetry , it is required to fulfill the following condition @xmath19= \\sin\\theta+\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\cos\\theta.\\ ] ] once eq.([condition ] ) is fulfilled , the spin operator @xmath20 commutes with the resulting hamiltonian @xmath21\\left(\\alpha\\sigma_x-\\beta\\sigma_y\\right),\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath22=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the spin symmetry is set up for transversal eigenstates having longitudinal momentum @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> according to eq.([condition ] ) , this can be done by tuning a proper intensity @xmath24 and an orientation of the applied in - plane magnetic field for given strengths @xmath6 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that this property is valid for any transversal potential defining the wire geometry , since the symmetry arises from the relation between the rdi and the zeeman interaction in conjunction with the longitudinal translational invariance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is an extra degree of freedom , since the rdi strengths ( for example , @xmath6 ) can be modified as well in order to fulfill the condition .    in virtue of the spin symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the spinorial part of the eigenstates can be expressed as @xmath25 where thereafter @xmath26 . these eigenspinors correspond to the in - plane orientation of the spin , where the particular orientation is determined by the ratio between the strengths of the both spin - orbit mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the hamiltonian the spin - dependent term , linear in the transversal momentum @xmath27 , can be eliminated by redefining the origin of the transversal momentum for each spin state . </S>",
    "<S> the only effect of this term on the energy spectrum is a constant shift that may be neglected by changing the energy origin .    at the condition ( [ condition ] ) </S>",
    "<S> hold fixed , the spectrum of the system is composed of that corresponding to the spin - independent orbital motion @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , the constant shift and a contribution arising from a combination of the rdi strengths and the zeeman interaction @xmath30 here we introduced the absolute magnitude of the rdi strength vector @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the above contribution represents a constant spin splitting for the eigenstates and its value depends on the longitudinal momentum , the rdi strengths , the particular orientation and the intensity of the applied magnetic field . at the preserved symmetry the eigenstates ( [ psi ] ) take the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the eigenstates of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also defined the length @xmath35 giving the characteristic scale for the rdi strengths .    at given fermi energy @xmath36 eigenstates </S>",
    "<S> have a few real longitudinal momentum @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> some of them have @xmath37 ( propagating right ) , while the others have @xmath38 ( propagating left ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of those @xmath16 could satisfy the condition by the adjusted magnetic field and , consequently , the corresponding spinor does not depend on coordinates . however , even a small mixing between the selected state and those that propagate in the same direction but have different @xmath16 leads to the spin precession in the process of the propagation . to suppress unwanted @xmath16-values </S>",
    "<S> one can adjust the fermi energy ( or the potential @xmath0 ) to have only four real longitudinal momenta . </S>",
    "<S> next , the tuning of the intensity and the orientation of the magnetic field enables us to have two eigenstates ( with @xmath39 in eq.([spectrum ] ) ) , propagating in the same direction , with the same energy and @xmath40 . from eqs.([condition ] ) , ( [ spectrum ] ) one obtains that such a possibility can be realized , if the components of the magnetic field are proportional to the components of the rdi vector : @xmath41 as a result , there is no a spin - flip process for any superposition of these eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in contrast to the spin - field transistor proposed in ref.@xcite whose effect is based on a particular input spin polarization , in our case the spin - flip is absent for an arbitrary input spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> also , the magnetic field leads to a nonequivalence of the electron transport from the left to the right and vise versa : eq . </S>",
    "<S> is fulfilled for @xmath42 at the condition @xmath43 .    to illuminate the found effect in the electron transport </S>",
    "<S> we perform numerical calculations of the @xmath44-matrix in the tight - binding model ( cf @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> to proceed we use a square lattice @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 are vectors of a length @xmath48 in @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions , respectively ; @xmath48 is the lattice constant , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are integers ) . within this approach </S>",
    "<S> our hamiltonian has the following form @xmath53 here @xmath54 creates an electron at site n with spin @xmath55 and energy @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 stands for nearest neighbors sites @xmath15 and @xmath59 . for the sake of illustration , we choose for the wire potential a hard wall one : @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the system with a geometry shown in fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a finite scattering area with two lateral contacts . </S>",
    "<S> each contact is a narrow stripe with the width @xmath63 and , for simplicity , no spin - orbit couplings and no the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the contacts are gated to have two active channels ( spin up and down ) with a conductance @xmath64 in each . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rdi and the in - plane magnetic field present only in the scattering area of the length @xmath65 and the width @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment may consist of injecting a current @xmath67 through the left contact ( source ) to the wire and measuring the voltage drop @xmath68 generated in the right contact ( drain ) . according to the landauer - buttiker formalism for linear response ( cf @xcite ) , the ratio @xmath69 can be expressed by dint of the @xmath44-matrix elements @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denote the channels in the source ( the drain ) . in our approach </S>",
    "<S> the spin resolved conductance between the source and the drain is determined as @xmath72 \\sum_{nm}|s_{m\\sigma_2 n\\sigma_1}|^2 $ ] , where @xmath73 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance is calculated with the energy dependent @xmath44-matrix by direct solving the schrdinger equation in a discretized space according to the method suggested in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the interfaces ( the polarizers ) between areas with and without the rdi introduce some uncontrollable excitations of all modes inside the scattering area . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these excitations produce a superposition ( with coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) of two eigenfunctions @xmath76 with different longitudinal momenta and , therefore , rotate the spin during a transport along the @xmath49-axis . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one has the following expectation values @xmath77 where @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , for equal longitudinal momenta , the expectation values are independent on the @xmath49 coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the results ( see fig.[fig2 ] , top ) manifest a single common minimum of the spin - flip conductance @xmath79 for one value of the magnetic field orientation but for different sample lengths , at a given intensity of the magnetic field and at zero temperature . at this value eq . </S>",
    "<S> holds , indeed . for another angles </S>",
    "<S> there is the mixing of wavefunctions with different @xmath16 which leads to the electron spin rotation in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig3 ] illuminates the dependence of longitudinal momenta @xmath80 on the magnetic field orientation . at a particular value of the angle @xmath81 two wavenumbers </S>",
    "<S> coincide . </S>",
    "<S> however , the change of the magnetic field intensity ( the value of @xmath82 ) leads to avoided crossing of two curves @xmath80 .    in real experiments the injected beam consists of electrons with different energies due to , for example , a nonzero temperature </S>",
    "<S> the temperature induces a small mixture of spin - flip components and results in the increase of the spin - flip conductance ( see fig.[fig2 ] , bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not affect the angle value at which the minima occur simultaneously in the two samples at temperature @xmath83 k.    measurements of the rdi strengths is a subject of intensive experimental efforts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ratio @xmath84 could determined with the aid of the analysis of photocurrents @xcite . note that eq . </S>",
    "<S> enables us to determine the strengths of the rashba and dresselhaus interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use a wire with a length determined by the condition @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> according to our analysis ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , such a system produces a few , well resolved spin - flip conductance minima . </S>",
    "<S> this condition helps also to diminish the effect of evanescent modes . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy and the transversal potential @xmath0 should be taken to support only four propagating modes ( two with a positive @xmath16 , going to the right and two with a negative @xmath16 , going to the left ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measure of the spin - flip conductance provides a set of spin - flip minima at different intensities and different orientations of the magnetic field , at a fixed input polarization . taking another polarization and repeating the same measurement , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains a different pattern for the location of the minima . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the spin - flip conductance for two input polarizations  </S>",
    "<S> along @xmath49- and @xmath50- axis ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the required minimum which is subject to eq . at the same angle and the same intensity in different setups , since the effect is independent on the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> one might repeat measurements for different sample lengths , since the minimum position is independent on the length too . to diminish the effect of multiple reflection from the polarizers we suggest to use the same polarization direction in the both polarizers .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we found the condition ( eq.([condition ] ) ) to decouple the spin and the orbital motion of electrons in a quantum wire with the in - plane magnetic field and arbitrary rashba and dresselhaus strengths . at this condition </S>",
    "<S> there is the spin symmetry in an arbitrary transversal potential defining the wire geometry . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at the specific condition ( [ mf ] ) the magnetic field cancels the rdi for the electron momentum @xmath40 . as a result , during the electron transport through the wire </S>",
    "<S> the spin - flip rotation is absent for any chosen polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we propose the experiment to measure the strengths of the rashba and the dresselhaus interaction by finding the minimum of the spin - flip conductance , which should occur at the condition ( [ mf ] ) . </S>"
