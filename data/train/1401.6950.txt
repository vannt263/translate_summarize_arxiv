    "the casimir effect @xcite is a macroscopic effect of quantum field theory , which is caused by the polarization of the vacuum owing to the presence of material boundaries of a quantization volume , see review in ref.@xcite .",
    "the effect has been confirmed experimentally with a sufficient precision , see , e.g. refs.@xcite , as well as other publications cited in ref.@xcite , and this opens a way for various applications in modern nanotechnology .",
    "generically , the interest was focused on the casimir effect with quantized electromagnetic field , whereas the casimir effect with other ( nonelectromagnetic ) quantized fields was mostly regarded as an academic exercise that could hardly be validated in laboratory . however , the nonelectromagnetic fields can be charged , and this opens a new prospect allowing one to consider the casimir effect as that caused by the polarization of the vacuum of quantized charged matter owing to the presence of both the material boundaries and a background electromagnetic field inside the quantization volume .    in this respect",
    "it should be recalled that the effect of the background uniform electromagnetic field alone on the vacuum of quantized charged matter was studied long ago , see refs.@xcite and refs.@xcite for reviews .",
    "the case of a background field filling the whole ( infinite ) space is hard to be regarded as realistic , whereas the case of a background field confined to the bounded quantization volume for charged matter looks much more reasonable and even can be regarded as realizable in laboratory .",
    "moreover , there is no way to detect the energy density which is induced in the vacuum in the first case , whereas in the second case it results in the pressure from the vacuum on the boundary , and the latter is in principle detectable .",
    "one may suggest intuitively that the pressure , at least in certain circumstances , is positive , i.e. directed from the inside to the outside of the quantization volume .",
    "a natural question is , whether the pressure depends on a boundary condition imposed on the quantized charged matter field at the boundary ?",
    "thus , an issue of a choice of boundary conditions acquires a primary importance , requiring a thorough examination . to deal with this issue comprehensively , one has to care for the self - adjointness of a differential operator corresponding to the physical observable of a quantum system .",
    "a quest for the self - adjointness is stipulated by the mere fact that a multiple action is well - defined for the self - adjoint operator only , allowing for the construction of functions of the operator , such as evolution , zeta - function and heat kernel operators , etc .",
    "a relevant basic operator in the present context is that of one - particle energy ( or energy squared in the case of quantized relativistic bosonic fields ) .",
    "the requirement of its self - adjointness renders the most general set of boundary conditions , which may be further restricted by some additional physical constraints .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the casimir effect with a quantized charged massive scalar matter field in the background of an external uniform magnetic field ; both the quantized and external fields are confined between two parallel plates , and the external field is orthogonal to the plates .",
    "it should be noted that exactly this problem has been studied more than a decade ago in refs.@xcite , however , results obtained there are incomplete , and , therefore , somewhat misleading . in particular , according to them , there is no room for the validation of the aforementioned intuitive suggestion : the pressure in all circumstances is negative , i.e. the plates are attracted . on the contrary , we show that , even in the case of a weak magnetic field and a small distance between the plates , the pressure is either negative or positive , depending on the choice of a boundary condition .",
    "a much more essential distinction from refs.@xcite is that , in the case of a strong magnetic field and a large distance between the plates , the pressure is positive , being independent of the choice of a boundary condition and even of the distance between the plates .    in the next section we consider in general the problem of the self - adjointness for the operator of one - particle energy squared , which is the same as that for the covariant laplace operator . in section 3",
    "we discuss the vacuum energy density which is induced by an external uniform magnetic field and compare the appropriate expressions in the cases of the unbounded quantization volume and the quantization volume bounded by two parallel plates .",
    "a choice of boundary conditions for the quantized scalar field is considered in section 4 .",
    "the expressions for the casimir energy and force are obtained in section 5 .",
    "the conclusions are drawn and discussed in section 6 .",
    "we relegate some details of performing the infinite summation over discrete eigenvalues to the appendix .",
    "defining a scalar product as @xmath0 we get , using integration by parts , @xmath1 , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a two - dimensional surface bounding the three - dimensional spatial region @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the covariant derivative involving both affine and bundle connections .",
    "the covariant laplace operator , @xmath5 , is hermitian ( or symmetric in mathematical parlance ) , @xmath6 if @xmath7 = 0 . \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] the latter condition can be satisfied in various ways by imposing different boundary conditions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , among the whole variety , there may exist a possibility that a boundary condition for @xmath9 is the same as that for @xmath8 ; then operator @xmath5 is self - adjoint .",
    "the spectral theorem is valid for self - adjoint operators only , and this allows one to construct appropriate unitary operator exponentials playing the key role in defining the dynamical evolution of quantum systems , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite . in the case of a disconnected noncompact boundary consisting of two components , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , condition ( 3 ) takes the form , @xmath12-\\int\\limits_{\\partial{d}^{(-)}}{\\rm d}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}[\\tilde{\\chi}^{*}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\chi)- ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\tilde{\\chi})^{*}\\chi ] = 0 , \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] where normals to surfaces @xmath10 and @xmath11 are chosen to point in the same direction , i.e. outwards for @xmath13 and inwards for @xmath14 .",
    "one can introduce coordinates @xmath15 in such a way , that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are tangential to the boundary , while @xmath18 is normal to it , then the position of @xmath19 is identified with , say , @xmath20 . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 the integrand in ( 5 ) vanishes when the following condition is satisfied : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath27-matrix which is in general parametrized as @xmath28 thus , the explicit form of the boundary condition ensuring the self - adjointness of the laplace operator is @xmath29a\\nabla_{x}+{\\rm i}[1+e^{-{\\rm i}\\alpha}(u^{*}\\pm{v})]\\}\\chi|_{a}=\\ ] ] @xmath30a\\nabla_{x}\\pm{\\rm i}[1+e^{-{\\rm i}\\alpha}(u\\mp{v}^{*})]\\}\\chi|_{-a}\\eqno(8)\\ ] ] ( the same condition is for @xmath9 ) .",
    "similar considerations in a somewhat simplified form apply also to the operator of the covariant momentum component in the normal to the boundary direction,@xmath31 : @xmath32 the explicit form of the boundary condition ensuring the self - adjointness of @xmath31 is @xmath33(the same condition is for @xmath9 ) .    in the one - dimensional case ( when dimensions along the @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes are ignored ) ,",
    "the deficiency index is @xmath34 in the case of @xmath35 , see ref.@xcite , and @xmath36 in the case of @xmath31 , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "the four real parameters from ( 7 ) and the one real parameter from ( 10 ) are the self - adjoint extension parameters .",
    "when the account is taken for dimensions along the boundary , these parameters become arbitrary functions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . however , in such a general case , conditions ( 8) and ( 10 ) can not be regarded as the ones determining the spectrum of the momentum in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "therefore , we assume that the self - adjoint extension parameters are independent of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    moreover , there are further restrictions which are due to physical reasons .",
    "for instance , one may choose a one - parameter family of boundary conditions , ensuring the self - adjointness of the momentum operator in the @xmath18-direction , see ( 10 ) , then the laplace operator is surely self - adjoint .",
    "however , this choice is too restrictive , with a lack of physical motivation , and we shall follow another way .",
    "a solution to the stationary klein - fock - gordon equation , @xmath37 , will be chosen in such a manner that its phase is independent of the coordinate which is normal to the boundary .",
    "then @xmath38 which results in @xmath39and the number of the self - adjoint extension parameters is diminished to 3 .",
    "the density of the conserved current in the @xmath18-direction , @xmath40,\\eqno(12)\\]]in this case vanishes at the boundary : @xmath41 and , thus , the matter is confined within the boundaries .",
    "a much more stringent restriction is condition @xmath42 which results in @xmath43 meaning that the spectrum of the laplace operator is non - positive - definite .",

    "an approach of the authors of refs.@xcite is different , and by using some analytical methods of regularization they obtain a finite piece of the casimir energy , which is actually given by before the last sum in ( 65 ) .",
    "a common fault of refs.@xcite is that the weisskopf - term contribution to the casimir energy , @xmath212 , is completely ignored .",
    "finally , let us discuss the contribution of the quantized electromagnetic matter field to the casimir effect .",
    "the casimir force which is due to it is @xcite @xmath213 usually , the casimir effect is validated experimentally for the separation of parallel plates to be of order of @xmath214 , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite . even if the mass of the quantized charged matter field is estimated to be as small as the electron mass",
    "( the compton wavelength be of order of @xmath215 ) , then the contribution of the latter to the casimir effect is damped as @xmath216 , see ( 78 ) , and with stronger exponents , see ( 84 ) .",
    "the contribution of ( 86 ) becomes negligible at larger separations , where the contribution of the quantized charged matter field dominates due to its independence of the separation distance , see ( 76 ) or ( 82 ) ( and ( 28 ) in general ) .",
    "although supercritical values of the magnetic field , @xmath217 , are hardly feasible in laboratory ( but may be attainable in some astrophysical objects such as magnetars ) , the contribution of ( 76 ) may dominate for large enough but still subcritical values of the magnetic field , @xmath218 , which can be attained in future in laboratory .",

    "we start by presenting the infinite sum over @xmath147 as an integral over a contour in complex @xmath151-plane : @xmath148=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int\\limits_{c_{=}}{\\rm d}w{f(w^{2})}g(w),\\eqno(a.1)\\]]where contour @xmath219 consists of two parallel infinite lines going closely on the lower and upper sides of the real axis , see fig.1 , and @xmath220 possesses simple poles on the real axis at @xmath221 : @xmath222by deforming the parts of contour @xmath219 on the @xmath151-plane into contours @xmath223 and @xmath224 enclosing the lower and upper imaginary semiaxes , see fig.1 , we get @xmath148=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int\\limits_{c_{\\bigcap}}{\\rm d}w{f(w^{2})}g(w)+\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int\\limits_{c_{\\bigcup}}{\\rm d}w{f(w^{2})}g(w),\\eqno(a.3)\\]]where it is implied that all singularities of @xmath225 as a function of @xmath151 lie on the imaginary axis at some distances from the origin . in view of obvious relation @xmath226for real positive @xmath153 and @xmath227 , we obtain @xmath148=\\frac{\\rm i}{\\pi}\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}{\\rm d}\\nu\\{f[(-{\\rm i}\\nu)^{2}]-f[({\\rm i}\\nu)^{2}]\\}[g(-{\\rm i}\\nu)-g({\\rm i}\\nu)].\\eqno(a.4)\\]]let us note relation @xmath228where @xmath229and @xmath230note also that both @xmath231 and @xmath232 are exponentially decreasing at large @xmath153 . with the use of ( a.5 ) we get @xmath148=\\frac{\\rm i}{\\pi}\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}{\\rm d}\\nu\\{f[(-{\\rm i}\\nu)^{2}]-f[({\\rm i}\\nu)^{2}]\\}[2g(-{\\rm i}\\nu)+g(\\nu^{2})]-\\ ] ] @xmath233}+\\frac{\\rm i}{\\pi}\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}{\\rm d}\\nu{f[({\\rm i}\\nu)^{2}]}.\\eqno(a.8)\\ ] ]        @xmath148=\\frac{\\rm i}{\\pi}\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}{\\rm d}\\nu\\{f[(-{\\rm i}\\nu)^{2}]-f[({\\rm i}\\nu)^{2}]\\}[2g(-{\\rm i}\\nu)+g(\\nu^{2})]+\\ ] ] @xmath235 in view of relation @xmath236and the evenness of the integrand in the integral over @xmath237 , we obtain ( 56 ) .",
