    "since the launch of the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) in 1991 , pulsed gamma - rays have been detected from only 8 spin - driven pulsars .",
    "because of the small number of detected pulsars , there remain many unanswered questions in pulsar gamma - ray astronomy . the relationship between",
    "pulsar radio and gamma - ray emission is not clear . aside from the crab pulsar ,",
    "the shapes of radio and gamma - ray profiles are quite different , with the peaks of the radio and gamma - ray profiles falling at different pulse phases , suggesting that low- and high - energy emissions come from different regions of the magnetosphere .",
    "in fact , geminga , an extremely bright gamma - ray pulsar ( grp ) , is weak or quiet in the radio band .",
    "furthermore , the gamma - ray profiles are broader than the radio profiles , suggesting that the beaming solid angle for gamma - rays is larger than that for radio waves .",
    "models for the grp emission mechanism , such as the polar cap and outer gap models , have been invoked to explain the features of grps , but no model has been successful at explaining all of the observations .",
    "understanding grps may be the key to determining the nature of the unidentified egret sources , perhaps the largest mystery remaining from the cgro mission .",
    "of the 271 sources listed in the third egret catalog ( @xcite ) , 169 are not identified as either pulsars or blazars , the only known egret discrete sources . while some of these sources are distributed isotropically and therefore expected to be agn , 73 of the 169 unidentified sources are located within @xmath2 of the galactic plane .",
    "since pulsars are the only known galactic egret sources , it is likely that these unidentified sources are pulsars or an as - yet - unrecognized source population .",
    "modeling the grp population is important for estimating how many of the unidentified sources we expect to be pulsars , which of the unidentified sources are most likely to be pulsars , and how we should go about detecting their pulsed emission .",
    "understanding grps may also be important for explaining the intensity , galactic distribution , and spectrum of the diffuse galactic gamma - ray emission , the dominant feature of the gamma - ray sky .",
    "accurate models for this diffuse emission are essential for detecting all but the very strongest gamma - ray sources .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this emission is due solely to cosmic ray interactions with interstellar material or partly due to unidentified point sources .",
    "modeling the grp population allows us to estimate the pulsar contribution to the diffuse emission .",
    "furthermore , we can use measurements of the diffuse gamma - ray background to constrain important properties of grps .    as",
    "the cgro mission is ending and future gamma - ray missions are being planned , it is an appropriate time to assess the population characteristics of grps .",
    "suitable modeling allows us to constrain luminosity laws , luminosity evolution , and spatial distributions of grps and to predict the pulsar population that future high - energy telescopes such as the gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , with an estimated launch date of 2005 , will detect .    in order to address the above issues within the confines of the small number of detected grps",
    ", we have developed a likelihood analysis which employs all available information about grps , including pulsar detections , pulsar upper limits , and diffuse background measurements , to constrain their luminosity law and population parameters . in this paper , we describe the included data from the cgro instruments osse ( oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ) and egret ( energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ) .",
    "we present our model for pulsar gamma - ray luminosity and luminosity evolution , explain our likelihood analysis method , and discuss our results and their implications .",

    "we calculate the distance @xmath11 to each pulsar using the taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) model for galactic electron density , except for pulsars with more accurate distance measurements from parallax or a supernova remnant association .",

    "because the dependence of the population - averaged luminosity ( eq .  [ eq : avglum ] ) on period and magnetic field is much different than for the osse pulsars , the total diffuse egret flux varies differently with these parameters and actually _ increases _ with increasing @xmath64 and _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath5 for @xmath155 .",
    "figure 10 show that the contribution from unidentified pulsars to the diffuse flux is , at most , a few percent , and therefore is not important for models of the diffuse background .",
    "there are , however , several factors which influence this conclusion .",
    "for instance , as noted in section 2.2 , if the spectral index of the diffuse emission is @xmath156 and not @xmath14 , integrated diffuse fluxes would be 3 times greater . in this case",
    ", pulsars might comprise as much as 10% of the diffuse galactic emission .",
    "additionally , if the grp scale height is lower than the 0.5 kpc that we have assumed , a greater fraction of the diffuse flux could be due to pulsars .",
    "however , even with a scale height of 0.1 kpc , as used for the osse population , this fraction is always lower than 10% for reasonable values of @xmath62 , @xmath64 , and @xmath5 .    in figure 11 , we show the predicted flux distribution for a model population of grps given our best - fit luminosity law ( eq .  [ eq : hist ] ) and for values of @xmath62 , @xmath64 , and @xmath5 of 2.5 , 15 ms , and @xmath6 gauss , respectively . predicted fluxes for all known radio pulsars with measured @xmath4 and @xmath72",
    "are also shown .",
    "the point source sensitivity of egret ( @xmath157 ph @xmath158 s@xmath159 = @xmath160 ergs kpc@xmath161 s@xmath159 ) and the expected sensitivity of glast ( @xmath162 ph @xmath158 s@xmath159 = @xmath160 ergs kpc@xmath161 s@xmath159 ) are marked by dashed lines .",
    "we take @xmath163 to be twice that calculated by gehrels & michelson ( 1999 ) for a 2-year all sky survey , recognizing that because pulsars are primarily a low - latitude population , surveys for them will suffer from the increased diffuse background in the galactic plane .",
    "we estimate that egret should have detected roughly 20 pulsars .",
    "this number is tantalizing as , of the 73 unidentified egret sources within 10 degrees of the galactic plane , 17 have non - variable fluxes , as we expect for pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore suggest , as have others , that these unidentified egret sources are grps . unfortunately , due to the long integration times needed to detect only a small number of gamma - ray photons from these sources , searches for pulsars of unknown period in the egret data are prohibitive . searching for",
    "radio pulsar counterparts will help to determine the nature of some of these sources , but because radio pulsar beams are evidently narrower than gamma - ray beams , many of these pulsars will be radio - quiet . therefore , detecting these egret unidentified sources as pulsars will likely have to wait for a more sensitive high - energy instrument which will allow blind periodicity searches .    according to figure 11",
    ", glast should detect roughly 750 grps as steady sources .",
    "we estimate that 140 of these pulsars ( including all unidentified egret sources , if they are indeed grps ) could be detected through a blind periodicity search of glast data of 50 , where @xmath164 is the number of pulsed source counts and @xmath165 is the number of total counts , for detection , as in mattox et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . ] .",
    "we note that , using the same detection criterion , only 3 egret pulsars are detectable through a blind periodicity search of egret data .",
    "figure 11 also shows that about 120 of the approximately 1000 currently known radio pulsars should be seen by glast . with this large sample of radio and gamma - ray emitting pulsars , which will undoubtedly increase as the parkes survey and other surveys near completion",
    ", one may compare radio and gamma - ray pulse profiles , enabling us to determine where in the magnetosphere the gamma - ray emission is coming from and providing important insights on the merits of outer gap and polar cap models .",
    "for the pulsars which are not detectable in the radio and are too faint to perform a blind search with glast data , x - ray observations may yield counterparts . as the angular resolution of glast will be better than that of egret",
    ", these searches should be much more feasible because fewer trial sky positions need to be considered in referencing photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter .",
    "our prediction of 750 glast - detectable pulsars is dependent upon several assumptions .",
    "we are taking @xmath57 , the maximum fraction of spin - down luminosity a pulsar may convert to gamma - ray luminosity , to be 0.5 . if the actual value of @xmath57 is lower than this , fewer pulsars will be detectable by glast . for example , if @xmath57 is actually 0.1 , we expect 610 glast - detectable pulsars . in figure 11 , we plot the predicted flux distribution for a population with @xmath57 of 0.01 .",
    "while this value is so low as to be inconsistent with the measured gamma - ray luminosities of the known egret pulsars , the figure illustrates the effect a lower @xmath57 has on the expected flux distribution .",
    "we note that , because the scaling of the best - fit osse luminosity law with @xmath4 and @xmath5 is far steeper than the scaling of @xmath58 with these values , the predicted osse flux distribution is insensitive to @xmath57 .",
    "our glast prediction is also dependent upon assuming a birthrate of 1/(100 yr ) .",
    "it is possible , however , that the actual pulsar birthrate is substantially higher or lower than this value .",
    "adopting a much higher or lower birthrate while keeping all other parameters fixed would cause the histogram in figure 11 to be inconsistent with the egret pulsar detections .",
    "however , because the flux histogram of figure 11 depends not only on the number of pulsars but also on the average luminosity of a pulsar , changing the braking index , magnetic field , and initial spin period can compensate for a reduced birthrate . for reasonable values of these parameters ( i.e. @xmath166 ;",
    "1 ms @xmath167 ms ; @xmath168 ) , birthrates as low as 1/(500 yr ) and as high as 1/(25 yr ) can be made consistent with the observed grp flux distribution .",
    "our histogram of predicted fluxes also depends on the spatial distribution model we choose for the pulsar population .",
    "our model does not account for the location of the spiral arms or for local density variations , which is evidenced by the discrepancy between our model s predictions and the detections of the bright vela , geminga , and crab pulsars .",
    "adopting a model with a larger radial scale and/or including spiral arms would cause the number of glast - detectable pulsars and the expected density of pulsars in our region of the galaxy to increase .    furthermore , and perhaps most significantly , because glast has not yet been built , its actual sensitivity is not yet known .",
    "additionally , this sensitivity will be latitude dependent and will also depend upon models for the diffuse galactic background .",
    "while we defer a more thorough analysis which includes these effects to a later paper , we do find that the number of detectable pulsars varies with glast sensitivity as @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , if the actual sensitivity is half our assumed value , we expect roughly 1500 glast - detectable pulsars . for a sensitivity",
    "twice that we have assumed , we expect 500 glast - detectable pulsars .",
    "figure 12 lists the known pulsars with the top 50 predicted egret fluxes , along with measured fluxes and upper limits , indicating which pulsars are good candidates for gamma - ray detection with future instruments .",
    "error bars are derived from the uncertainties on @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and distance . again , as discussed in section 5.1 , a pulsar s actual detectable gamma - ray flux may be higher or lower than that listed in figure 12 , depending upon the correctness of our assumptions about beaming .",
    "we note that the measured and predicted fluxes for psr b1055 - 52 differ significantly",
    ". some of this may be due to the uncertain alignment between the rotation axis and the line of sight to this pulsar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence that this pulsar is much closer than we have assumed . while we derive a distance of 1.5 kpc from its dispersion measure and the taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) model , gelman and finley ( 1993 ) , in their analysis of the rosat x - ray data , found that a distance of 500 pc would produce a more realistic estimate of the neutron star radius ( 15 km compared to 30 km for the 1.5 kpc estimate ) .",
    "furthermore , combi , romero , and azcrate ( 1997 ) derive a distance estimate of 700 pc from a study of the extended nonthermal radio source around the pulsar .",
    "therefore , in figure 12 , we also mark the predicted flux for psr b1055 - 52 for a revised distance of 500 pc .",
    "it is interesting that adopting a distance of 500 pc removes the constraint that this pulsar must be converting 30% of its spin - down energy into observable gamma - ray luminosity . with the revised distance estimate ,",
    "a conversion percentage of only 3% is necessary .",
    "similarly , we may also be overestimating the distance to vela .",
    "while we are using the commonly quoted distance of 0.5 kpc for vela ( @xcite ) , recent spectroscopic evidence suggests that this pulsar may actually be only 0.25 kpc away ( cha et al .",
    "1999 ) . adopting this revised distance",
    "would alter our best - fit model modestly , but would have a large effect on the implied efficiency of gamma - ray production for the vela pulsar , lowering it from 1.5% to 0.4% .",
    "incidentally , assuming a 0.5 kpc distance for b1055 - 52 , the geminga pulsar is the most efficient converter of spin - down energy to gamma - rays , with an implied efficiency of 22% .",
    "the crab pulsar , with an implied efficiency of 0.01% , is the least efficient of the egret pulsars .",
    "we have used osse and egret pulsar detections , measured upper limits , and diffuse background measurements to constrain the luminosity law and some properties of the gamma - ray pulsar population .",
    "the luminosity laws are quite different at osse and egret energies , suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for pulsar low- and high - energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "the osse law ( @xmath170 ) is roughly consistent with optical pulsar detections ( @xcite ) and is steeper than that found for rosat / asca pulsar detections ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is quite different from models which predict that a pulsar s gamma - ray luminosity should be some fraction of the total spin - down luminosity ( i.e. @xmath171 ) .",
    "the egret law ( @xmath172 ) is more similar to this spin - down law and even more consistent with a luminosity law which scales with the open - field line voltage drop ( i.e. @xmath173 ) .",
    "it is consistent with the basic polar cap ( @xcite ) and outer gap ( @xcite ) models that have been published .",
    "more gamma - ray pulsar detections and a comparison between radio and gamma - ray pulsar beam shapes and properties are necessary to discriminate between models and the many versions of them .",
    "we note that a pulsar s age is proportional to @xmath174 , so that the gamma - ray efficiency , or the fraction of total spin - down energy converted to gamma - ray luminosity , _ decreases _ with increasing age for osse pulsars and _ increases _ with increasing age for egret pulsars .",
    "because both the osse and egret best - fit luminosity laws differ from the standard @xmath58 model , they produce a new ranking of pulsars as candidates for gamma - ray detection and result in new predictions for the pulsar population we expect to see with future more sensitive gamma - ray instruments .",
    "we find that a more sensitive low - energy gamma - ray instrument ( 50@xmath0200 kev energy range ) would detect young , distant pulsars which are most likely not detectable through their radio emission",
    ". this would be enormously helpful for studies of young pulsars , pulsar populations , and supernova physics .",
    "a more sensitive high - energy gamma - ray instrument ( 0.1@xmath0100 gev energy range ) such as glast would detect roughly 750 grps as steady sources , most of which will have radio beams misaligned from our line of sight . of these 750 grps , roughly 120 will be known radio pulsars .",
    "about 140 of the 750 grps will be detectable as pulsars through blind periodicity searches , giving us a much more complete picture of the grp population .",
    "glast will be able to do blind periodicity searches on all of the unidentified egret sources , of which 20 are probably grps .",
    "we note that all predictions are dependent upon an assumed @xmath57 and birthrate and will vary for different values of these parameters .",
    "while there is currently a large range of acceptable values for these parameters , comparing model predictions and actual glast detections will enable us to constrain these parameters much more tightly .",
    "our prediction will also obviously depend upon the final sensitivity of glast , with the number of detectable pulsars scaling roughly as @xmath169 .",
    "we estimate the contribution of pulsars to the measured diffuse background in the osse and egret energy ranges , and find that while pulsars may be an important component of the diffuse background at osse energies , they are most likely not important at egret energies .",
    "we are able to use measurements of the diffuse background to constrain the braking index , initial spin period , and magnetic field of the pulsar population .",
    "the osse background allows us to place a 95% confidence upper limit of 4.75 on the pulsar braking index , a lower limit of 6.5 ms on the pulsar initial spin period , and an upper limit of @xmath147 gauss on the pulsar magnetic field , while the egret background implies a 95% confidence upper limit of 3.6 on @xmath62 , a lower limit of 7.1 ms on @xmath64 , and a lower limit of @xmath175 gauss on b. we note that there are large errors on these parameters , and that the real distributions of these quantities are likely to be more complicated than we have assumed . again , glast should allow us to constrain these parameters far more tightly than currently possible .    in order to do a more sophisticated analysis of the grp population ,",
    "more grp detections are necessary .",
    "large strides in our understanding of grps will likely have to wait until the launch of glast . in the meantime , however , there are useful things that can be done to further our understanding",
    ". while searches for periodicities in egret data are very difficult , they may not be impossible if one takes an iterative approach ( i.e. searching small , sequential intervals of data sets where fewer trial periods and positions are necessary ) and uses bayesian methods to detect pulses of unknown shape ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "searches for radio counterparts of the unidentified egret sources likely to be grps are also important , as some grps will emit in the radio and even non - detections provide useful information",
    ". furthermore , whenever new x - ray or radio pulsars are detected , especially young or nearby pulsars , one should return to the osse and egret data and fold them .",
    "an accurate ephemeris may not be available but a known period allows a smaller range of parameters to search and a reduction of the search threshold .",
    "some of the parkes multibeam pulsars ( @xcite ) , for instance , are excellent gamma - ray candidates .",
