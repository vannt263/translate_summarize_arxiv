    "since sauter in 1931 @xcite and heisenberg and euler @xcite four years later gave a first description of the vacuum properties of qed , there have been a lot of investigations of the pair creation rate in strong electric fields . in particular ,",
    "schwinger @xcite reformulated their result in an elegant way using quantum - field theoretic methods ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ the formulation was extended to space - time - dependent fields using different methods , e.g.  the imaginary time method @xcite and a tunneling picture @xcite , both using wkb - approximations or the world - line instanton method @xcite .",
    "+ by comparing numerical with analytic results it was found that for more complicated field configurations , i.e.  for those which have more than one distinct pair of semiclassical turning points , interference effects arise .",
    "this was already discussed as a resonance effect for oscillating fields in @xcite .",
    "interference effects were recently studied in @xcite for the wkb - method and in @xcite for the world - line instanton approach . in this paper",
    "we consider only fields with one dominant pair of turning points where interference effects are negligible .",
    "this enables us to use scalar quantum - electro dynamics , since it is known to give the same results as spinor quantum electrodynamics at the leading non - perturbative order if there are no interference effects @xcite . +",
    "all the analytic methods mentioned above give the same results for electric fields with only one component depending either on space or time . a more general case , namely electric fields with two or three components depending on space was discussed in @xcite in the world - line instanton approach .",
    "+ a special case namely a ( two component ) rotating electrical field was discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently pair production in rotating fields has been studied numerically in @xcite using the wigner formalism .",
    "these results can be used to calculate the pair creation rate of a plane wave in a plasma as shown in @xcite .",
    "+ so far , electron - positron pair production has not been directly observed in experiments due to the necessity of high field strengths which are out of the range reached by nowadays laser systems .",
    "however recent theoretical investigations have shown that less strong fields are needed if one uses carefully - shaped multi - component laser pulses @xcite . + for this reason , we generalize the above mentioned analytic methods to compute the pair creation rate for a general time - dependent periodic electrical field which is characterized by the potential @xmath1=\\frac{1}{e\\,c}[0,v_1(t),v_2(t),v_3(t ) ] .\\label{eq : potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to do so we use the wkb - approximation as well as the world - line instanton method of @xcite .",
    "+ as is well known , the wkb approach the pair creation rate per volume @xmath2 takes the general form ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath3 where the integral over @xmath4 is over the momentum modes of the produced pairs .",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) @xmath6 is a characteristic electric field strength and @xmath7 is a function depending on the explicit form of the electric field , which is straightforwardly generalized to more than one component .",

    "+ in the world - line instanton framework of @xcite the momentum , arising as an integration constant , was implicitly taken to vanish with a gaussian momentum integration producing the prefactors , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we argue that this is a _ de facto _ expansion around @xmath0 .",
    "we generalize this method to the case of electric fields with more than one component and show that the result agrees with the wkb result expanded around @xmath0 .",
    "+ looking at examples of electric fields with two components we find that the momentum spectrum is not necessarily peaked around zero momentum . in these cases",
    "the expanded wkb result as well as the equivalent world - line instanton method based on the one of @xcite can not be applied , because they do not represent a good approximation . in general",

    "the klein - gordon equation reduces to an effective schrdinger equation .",

    "if there is more than one pair of turning points interference effects can occur .",
    "these are governed by integrals between these different pairs . for the scope of this paper",
    "we will however concentrate on the case of one dominant pair of turning points for which interference is negligible .",
    "this also enables one to use scalar quantum electro dynamics . since as shown in @xcite for the case of no interference effects the results obtained in this way are equivalent to the ones of spinor quantum electrodynamics at the leading non perturbative order . + in section [ sec : k ] we show how to simplify the integration between the turning points for analytic purposes .",
