    "the thomas - fermi ( tf ) model @xcite for the effective electrostatic potential at an arbitrary point in the bulk of a heavy atom emerged as a forerunner of the density functional theory almost ninety years ago , and with some improvements is still in common use for predictions concerning the stability and sizes of heavy atoms , ions , and molecules @xcite .",
    "the tf equation belongs to the class of emden - fowler nonlinear equations which have the forms @xmath0 or @xmath1 where the change of power of the independent variable in the latter equation is obtained via the transformation @xmath2 .",

    "this type of equations became first known in theoretical astrophysics where they dominated the main stream literature for decades as the basic equations for the newtonian gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric polytropic gas @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical applications are described by the case @xmath5 , with @xmath4 related to the polytropic index , the dependent variable related to the density of the self - gravitating gas and the independent variable as a dimensionless radius of the gas structure .",

    ", the thomas - fermi model @xcite describing the electronic screening effect in the bulk of a heavy atom leads to the same form of the equation , though for a non - integer @xmath4 and with the positive sign in the right hand side . in both astrophysics and atomic physics applications , the self - adjoint form of eq .",

    ", we provide a discussion of a class of emden - fowler equations presenting fractional powers of both parameters that can be considered as _ generalized thomas - fermi equations _ since the tf equation is just the first particular case of the whole chain .",
    "we show explicitly that these generalized tf equations are related to non integrable abel equations and therefore no closed solutions are possible for any case of this class .",

    "these nonlinear oscillators have a negative constant ` damping ' ratio @xmath32 and a specific stiffness of @xmath33 of the same value as the specific strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "the interesting feature of these nonlinear oscillators is that when @xmath34 is increased from @xmath35 ( the tf case ) to @xmath36 , the ` damping ' ratio varies only from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , whereas the specific stiffness decreases six times , from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , in parallel with the same decrease of the specific strength of the nonlinearity while the latter raises its power index from three halves to quadratic . to display the limits of variation of the coefficients of this class of nonlinear equations , we use @xmath14 and @xmath41 in eqs .   and which leads to @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "we also notice that the characteristic equation of the corresponding linear oscillator has the roots @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the case of the tf equation , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; moreover , their square product is @xmath48 .",
