    "over the last few years , studies on galaxy clusters using x - ray emission observations have been a source of a tremendous increase in the litterature , especially those using sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect . the sz effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich @xcite , rephaeli @xcite , birkinshaw @xcite ) is one of the major sources of secondary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) arising from inverse compton scattering of the microwave photons by hot electrons in clusters of galaxies .",

    "for example , by combining the sz intensity change and the @xmath0-ray emission observations , and solving for the number density distribution of electrons responsible for both these effects ( after assuming a certain geometrical shape ) , the angular diameter distance to galaxy clusters can be derived . assuming a cosmological model , this leads to an estimate of the hubble constant @xmath1 ( holzapfel , arnaud , ade et al .",

    "+ the sz effect thus offers the possibility to put important constraints on the cosmological models .",
    "for this reason , different projects to measure the sz effect are under way for example the mito instrument ( de petris , aquilina , canonico et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) or ( the longer term ) the planck mission ( esa report @xcite ) .",
    "+ the sz effect is difficult to measure accurately , since systematic errors can be significant .",
    "for instance , inagaki , suginohara & suto ( @xcite ) made an analysis of the reliability of the hubble constant determination based on the sz effect .",
    "+ an additional effect arises if the cluster has a peculiar velocity ( kinematic effect ) .",
    "several papers discussed the influence of the kinematic effect on the measurement of the thermal sz effect ( de luca , dsert & puget , @xcite ; audit & simmons , @xcite for transverse clusters velocities ) .",
    "note that the kinematic effect can thus be used to infer the peculiar velocity of clusters of galaxies , if the value of the hubble constant is known ( rephaeli & lahav , @xcite ; haehnelt & tegmark , @xcite ) .",
    "another possible distortion on the sz effect is due to gravitational lensing ( blain , @xcite ; roettiger et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the extension and the geometry of hot gas distribution in clusters of galaxies is also an important source of systematic errors in the sz effect .",
    "cooray ( @xcite ) showed that projection effects of clusters can affect the calculations of the hubble constant and the gas mass fraction .",
    "recently , sulkanen ( @xcite ) showed that galaxy cluster shapes can produce systematic errors in @xmath1 measured via the sz effect .",
    "it is thus necessary to know , at least approximately , the shape of the clusters , for instance , if they are oblate or prolate ( cooray @xcite , hughes & birkinshaw @xcite ) or have a more general geometry .",
    "+ the @xmath2-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano @xcite ) is widely used in @xmath0-ray astronomy to parametrize the gas density profile in clusters of galaxies by fitting their surface brightness profile .",

    "+ the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the shape and the finite extension of an ellipsoidal cluster gas distribution on the sz effect , and to discuss the possible errors induced in the inferred value for @xmath1 . the paper is organized as follows : + in section [ sz : s2 ] we present the calculations of the sz effect and the @xmath0-ray surface brightness for an ellipsoidal shape with an isothermal profile and a finite cluster extension .",

    "+ section [ sz : s3 ] is then devoted to a quantitative discussion of the incidence of these effects on the sz measurements , in particular , the finite extension and the geometry ( prolate and oblate ) of the cluster . the influence of a polytropic thermal profile on the sz measurements is also considered .",

    "<S> we find that the non - inclusion of such effects can induce errors up to 30% in the various parameters and in particular on the hubble constant value , when compared with results obtained under the isothermal , infinitely extended and spherical shape assumptions . </S>"
