    "@xcite this situation indicates that the magnetic properties are highly sensitive to small details of the crystal structure , which , so far , has been established only at room temperature .",
    "@xcite    the important magnetic units in these systems are jahn - teller distorted ( cux@xmath7)-tetrahedra ( x = cl , br ) which are arranged in layers separated by the alkali atoms .",
    "a deep understanding of the relationship between crystal structure and electronic and magnetic behavior in the series cs@xmath0cu(cl@xmath1br@xmath2 ) requires a detailed structural analysis as a function of @xmath3 and temperature .",
    "therefore , we started the crystal growth of the mixed system cs@xmath0cu(cl@xmath1br@xmath2 ) with a systematic substitution of cl by br for @xmath10 .",
    "it was shown that the orthorhombic structure type ( @xmath11 ) characterized by triangular - lattice spin-@xmath9-layers can be obtained from aqueous solution over the whole range of @xmath3 if the growth temperature is above @xmath12c .",
    "@xcite the magnetic properties and sterical considerations suggested distinct magnetic regimes through a site - selective substitution of the br atoms on the three different crystallographic halogen positions .",

    "@xcite    the purpose of the present work is to gain detailed information on the structural properties of cs@xmath0cu(cl@xmath1br@xmath2 ) at low temperatures by means of x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments . in particular , we are specially interested in identifying any structural phase transition that might occur upon lowering the temperature as the orthorhombic structure was found to be metastable for @xmath13.@xcite furthermore , we determine accurately the crystal structure parameters for @xmath6 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we perform density functional theory ( dft ) calculations using the identified crystal structures and investigate the various superexchange couplings between cu spins . in previous dft calculations",
    "it was demonstrated that the superexchange couplings sensitively depend on fine structural details of the local cu environment given by the [ cux@xmath5-tetrahedra ( x denotes the halogen atom , cl or br ) .",
    "@xcite this indicates that even in the absence of a structural phase transition , magnetic interactions in cs@xmath0cu(cl@xmath1br@xmath2 ) might be strongly modified by temperature - induced structural variations .",
    "one of the main findings of the present study is that the latter effect is indeed strong in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath8 , and the dft calculations with the correct low - temperature crystal structure can reproduce the experimental coupling constants .",

    "with such a configuration , good agreement could be achieved with much lower @xmath36 values .",
    "furthermore , no peculiarities were observed in the isotropic displacement parameters for the different atomic positions .",
    "therefore , in table  [ tab1 ] we have split the halogen positions for cl and br .",
    "however , within the resolution of our pxrd data we can not completely rule out some cl - br site - disorder in these compounds . from several measurements on different powdered crystals we estimate an upper boundary of this site - disorder of about 10% .",
    "this means for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath0br@xmath0 that at most every @xmath37 br - atom might sit on a x3 site .",
    "we like to note that for crystals grown directly from the melt at around @xmath38c ( bridgman - method ) , we could not observe this site - selective occupation of the br - atoms , but only a random distribution of the halogen atoms on the three different crystallographic positions .",

    "the site - selective occupation of the br - atoms leads to an additional deformation for @xmath41 and 2 evident from fig .",
    "cs@xmath0cucl@xmath17br@xmath18 has the br atom on the crystallographic x2 site , leading to a [ cucl@xmath17br@xmath18]-tetrahedron elongated along @xmath31 , but compressed in its @xmath32 direction .",

    "this cu - x3-x3-cu distance is determined by the bonding angle @xmath44 and the distances cu - x3 as well as x3-x3 .",
    "these parameters are summarized in table  [ tab3 ] , where the non - linear development with @xmath3 becomes apparent , in combination with a strongly varying temperature dependence ( including positive and negative @xmath22-coefficients ) . in the last line of table  [ tab3 ] the length of the spin superexchange path from cu to cu along the @xmath32-direction at 20 k",

    "@xcite there it was shown that the maximum at around 3k , which is primarily determined through @xmath34 , is nearly unchanged for @xmath46 , followed by a linear increase for @xmath47 .    in order to study the influence of these strong structural variations with @xmath3 and @xmath22 on the magnetic interactions in more detail , a more accurate calculation of the spin superexchange",
    "coupling constants using density functional methods would be insightful . in the next section , we present dft calculations for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath8 with the low-@xmath22 structural data as input parameters and compare them with our earlier results , which were obtained from the room - temperature structure data .",
    "to derive the spin superexchange coupling constants in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath8 within dft , we employ the full - potential linearized augmented plane waves method as implemented in the wien2k code .",

    "no further structural relaxation was performed within dft . for both temperatures ,",
    "the leading magnetic interactions are by far the nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath34 and @xmath35 within the triangular lattice .",
    "we calculated these two superexchange paths for three values of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath49 and 8 ev .",
    "the realistic @xmath50 value is close to 6 ev ( @xmath51 1/ev ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , however , is remarkable , because these couplings from the 20 k structure are by a factor of @xmath52 larger than those from the 300 k structure , while their ratio @xmath53 remains roughly unchanged .",

    "[ fig6 ] with horizontal lines of respective colors .    comparing the structural data at 300 and 20k ,",
    "we can identify structural changes that can be responsible for such a pronounced variation of the leading exchange couplings .",
    "for instance , the interaction path @xmath34 between two consecutive [ cux@xmath5-tetrahedra in the @xmath32-direction is controlled by the cu - x3-x3 angle @xmath54 , the cu - x3 distance and the cu - x3-x3-cu path length ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "remarkably , the variation with temperature of these particular structural parameters is significantly pronounced for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath8 and most probably the reason for the strong temperature dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 evident from fig .",
    "we have presented a detailed low - temperature structural characterization of the triangular antiferromagnets cs@xmath0cu(cl@xmath1br@xmath2 ) .",
    "our measurements show a site - selective occupation of br atoms on specific halogen sites , leading to a strong variation of the local cu environment as a function of temperature and br - concentration .",
    "the temperature - dependent experimental structure data was then used as a starting point for calculating the magnetic coupling constants using density functional methods .",
    "this joint experimental and theoretical study reveals a strong temperature dependence of the magnetic interactions in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath8 .",
    "such behavior is caused by both , a large sensitivity of the exchange interactions to the structural details as well as the particularly non - trivial temperature dependence of the crystal structure .",
