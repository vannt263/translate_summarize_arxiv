    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is a nonlinear optical effect that renders an opaque medium transparent in a narrow spectral region due to the incidence of auxiliary light called control light @xcite . the eit effect is caused by destructive interference between two excitation pathways in three - level atoms .",
    "in addition to the absorption , the refractive index of the medium is significantly modified in the transparency region , and the group velocity of the light is dramatically reduced @xcite .",
    "the linewidth of the transparency region and the group velocity can be controlled by the intensity of the control light .",
    "the slow - light effect in the eit medium was developed to store light ; this is realized by temporal control of the eit effect through switching of the control light .",
    "the storage of light has been widely studied to realize optical memory and quantum memory @xcite .",
    "the interference phenomenon is found not only in quantum systems but also in classical systems , and classical analogs of the atomic eit effects are demonstrated in various systems , such as the classical coupled oscillator @xcite , optical waveguide coupled with cavities @xcite , optomechanical system@xcite , and acoustic system @xcite . in addition , there are many ways to mimic atomic eit effects with electromagnetic metamaterials , which are assemblies of artificial structures ( i.e. , meta - atoms ) , at a scale much smaller than the operating wavelength . since experimental demonstrations in the microwave region were first performed @xcite , the sharp transparency and resulting slow propagation have been demonstrated at higher frequencies , including the terahertz @xcite and optical ranges @xcite .",
    "the operation of these eit - like metamaterials is well described by a coupled - resonator model composed of a high - loss resonator interacting with a propagating wave and a low - loss resonator decoupled from the wave .",
    "the former resonance mode is referred to as the _ radiative _ or _ bright mode _ , and the latter is called the _ trapped _ or _",
    "dark mode_. when these two resonators are coupled , the energy received through the radiative mode is transferred into the trapped mode with a long lifetime , and the dissipation and propagation speed are substantially reduced .",
    "if the resonant frequencies of the two resonators are identical , a sharp transparent region appears at the center of a broad absorption profile with a symmetrical shape , like in the original atomic eit effect . on the other hand , when the resonant frequencies are different , the transparent region is located at the shoulder of the broad absorption profile and shows an asymmetrical shape @xcite , which is unique to the fano resonance @xcite .",
    "in addition to slow propagation , eit - like metamaterials are applied to implementing various functionalities , such as accurate sensing @xcite , manipulation of near fields @xcite , nonreciprocal transmission @xcite , lasing spacers @xcite , and absorption enhancement @xcite .    in order to realize practical applications , including the storage of electromagnetic waves ,",
    "the tunability of the eit - like effects is quite important .",
    "many researchers report various methods to tune eit - like metamaterials in a passive manner by changing the incident angles @xcite and in active manners by conductivity modulation utilizing diodes @xcite , superconductors @xcite , and photocarrier excitation in a semiconductor @xcite or by tuning an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed an eit - like metamaterial whose properties can be controlled by applying bias voltages to diodes to change their capacitances , and we experimentally demonstrated the storage of electromagnetic waves in the microwave region @xcite .",
    "this method can be regarded as static - electric - field - induced transparency and is promising owing to the tunability .",
    "however , the static field can not propagate in free space , and it should be individually fed to each meta - atom through a bias circuit , which complicates the structure and causes difficulty in increasing the number of meta - atoms .",
    "the metamaterials introduced above reproduce the sharp transparency and slow propagation unique to the atomic eit effect ; however , the analogy is incomplete in the sense that there is no counterpart to the control light , which plays an important role in controlling the eit effect in the atomic system . in this sense , it is not appropriate to use `` _ electromagnetically induced transparency _ '' to refer to these metamaterials . in this paper , we propose a method to implement true eit in a metamaterial ; in other words , the functions of the metamaterial can be controlled by the incidence of an auxiliary electromagnetic wave or control wave .",
    "the proposed metamaterial also has a radiative mode and a trapped mode whose resonant frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , are quite different . if nonlinear elements are properly installed in the metamaterial , the two resonant modes can be coupled in the presence of the control wave oscillating at @xmath2 through the parametric process . the coupling mechanism , which we call nonlinearity - assisted coupling , is employed in several studies to realize an effective magnetic field for photons @xcite or to enhance second - harmonic generation in a metamaterial @xcite .",
    "we can show that the time evolution of the coherence of three - level atoms in the atomic eit medium and the charge oscillation in our metamaterial are governed by the same differential equations . as a result",
    ", the electric susceptibilities of the atomic eit medium and our metamaterial can be written with the same form , which means that it is impossible to differentiate the metamaterial from the atomic eit medium simply by measuring the electromagnetic response in an effective - medium approximation .    in this paper , we first review the eit effect in an atomic medium in sec .",
    "[ sec : atom ] and introduce the metamaterial loaded with nonlinear capacitors to implement the true eit effect in sec .  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we explicitly describe the analogy to the atomic eit effect and compare the original eit system to the circuit model of the metamaterial . for both systems , we define different physical quantities with the same notations to explicitly express the relationship . in sec.[sec : simulation ] , we examine the validity of the approximated expressions derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] through numerical calculations and describe the physical mechanism of the eit effect in the metamaterial analog . in sec .",
    "[ sec : design ] , we present the actual design of the metamaterial , which has a resonant mode for a control wave besides the radiative mode and the trapped mode .",
    "we show the linear response of the metamaterial calculated by electromagnetic simulation and discuss the role of each resonant mode . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] , we demonstrate the control of the eit effect by using a control wave in the microwave region .",
    "we can control the width of the transparency window by changing the intensity of the control wave .",
    "furthermore , we can control the position of the transmission peak and the fano line shape by tuning the frequency of the control wave .",
    "compared with the static - electric - field - induced transparency@xcite , which requires the bias circuit on each meta - atom , the functions to receive the control wave and modulate the capacitances for frequency mixing are integrated into the metamaterial .",
    "we can tune the eit effect just by illuminating the metamaterial with the propagating control wave .",
    "in addition , the resonance enhancement for the control wave is also one of the advantages , and we can enhance the efficiency of the control wave by increasing the quality factor of the resonance mode for the control wave .",

    "our method provides three free parameters in the control wave : amplitude @xmath46 , phase @xmath163 , and frequency @xmath68 , while only amplitude is available for static - electric - field - induced transparency .",
    "as demonstrated in the experiment , the position of the transparency window and the spectral shape can be controlled by @xmath68 without changing the structure of the metamaterial .",
    "while the transmission spectrum is independent of @xmath163 , the phase of the oscillation in the trapped mode is determined by @xmath163 .",
    "this property is also important in the atomic eit system , where the phase of the control light is converted into spin coherence .",
    "for example , it is used to manipulate the direction of a retrieved signal in a storage and retrieval experiment through the phase - matching condition @xcite .",
    "we expect that most of the applications demonstrated for the atomic eit system @xcite , such as the storage of light and enhancement of four - wave mixing , can be realized with the metamaterial .",
