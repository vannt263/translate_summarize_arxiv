    "nonextensive statistical physics provides a rich framework for the interpretation of complex systems behavior whenever classical statistical physics fails @xcite .",
    "the basic tool for this approach is the extension of the classical boltzmann entropy to the wider class of tsallis entropies . in this context , the usual gaussian distributions",
    "is extended to the q - gaussian distributions , to be defined below .",
    "the study of the properties of these distributions is an interesting problem , being the subject of a number of recent publications @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the extension of the usual stability result that holds in the gaussian case , namely , that if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are independent gaussian random variables with unit variance , then the linear combination@xmath4 is again gaussian and@xmath5 where @xmath6 is gaussian with unit variance , and @xmath7 denotes equality in distribution .",
    "this stability property is at the core of the central limit theorem ( clt ) , which describes the behavior of systems that result of the additive superposition of many independent phenomena .",
    "the clt can be ranked among the most important results in probability theory and statistics , and plays an essential role in several disciplines , notably in statistical mechanics .",
    "pioneers like a. de moivre , p.s .",
    "de laplace , s.d .",
    "poisson , and c.f .",
    "gauss have shown that the gaussian distribution is the attractor of the superposition process of independent systems with a finite second moment .",
    "distinguished authors like chebyshev , markov , liapounov , feller , lindeberg , and lvy have also made essential contributions to the clt - development .",
    "as far as physics is concerned one can state that , starting from any system with any finite variance distribution function ( for some measurable quantity @xmath8 ) , and combining additively a sufficiently large number of such independent systems together , the resultant distribution function of @xmath8 is always gaussian .",
    "a natural question is thus the extension of the stability result ( [ eq : gaussiancase ] ) to the nonextensive case , that is , for q - gaussian distributions .",
    "this interesting problem is currently the subject of several publications ( see for example @xcite ) in which possible extensions of the clt to the nonextensive context are studied .",
    "the aim of this communication is to give some geometric insight into the behavior of q - gaussian distributions for the case @xmath9 .",
    "in nonextensive statistics , the usual shannon entropy of a density probability @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 is replaced by its tsallis version@xmath12 where the nonextensivity index @xmath13 is a real parameter , usually taken to be positive . it can be checked by applying lhospital s rule that shannon s entropy coincides with the limit case @xmath14    it is a well - known result that the distribution that maximizes the shannon entropy under a covariance matrix constraint @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is a symmetric definite positive matrix ) is the gaussian distribution@xmath17 its nonextensive counterpart , called a q - gaussian , is defined as follows .    the @xmath18variate distribution with zero mean and given covariance matrix @xmath15 having maximum tsallis entropy is denoted as @xmath19 and defined as follows for @xmath20    @xmath21    with matrix @xmath22 , parameter @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 and notation @xmath25 moreover , the partition function is @xmath26 we note that this distribution has bounded support ; namely , @xmath27 only when @xmath6 belongs the ellipsod @xmath28    we also need the notion of spherical vector , defined as follows :    a random vector @xmath29 is spherical if its density @xmath10 is a function of the norm @xmath30 of @xmath6 only , namely@xmath31 for some function @xmath32    an alternative characterization of a spherical vector is as follows @xcite :    a random vector @xmath29 is spherical if@xmath33 for any orthogonal matrix @xmath34 where sign @xmath7 denotes equality in distribution .",
    "this property highlights the importance of spherical vectors in physics since they describe systems that are invariant by orthogonal transformation .",
    "a fundamental property of a spherical vector is the following :    @xcite if @xmath29 is a spherical random vector , then it has the stochastic representation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a uniform vector on the sphere @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a positive scalar random variable independent of @xmath39 moreover , @xmath38 has stochastic representation @xmath40",
    "we start with a heuristic approach to the stability problem , namely the behavior of the random variable @xmath41 when @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two unit variance , q - gaussian independent random vectors in @xmath44 with nonextensivity parameter @xmath45 let us assume that the following hypothesis - called ( h ) hypothesis :    @xmath46    holds so that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an integer ; a classical result is that @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) can then be considered as the @xmath18dimensional marginal vector of a random vector @xmath49 ( resp .",
    "@xmath50 ) that is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere @xmath51 in @xmath52 thus , there exist random vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath55 such that @xmath56\\,\\,\\text{and}\\,\\ , u_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } x_{2}\\\\ \\tilde{x}_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] are two @xmath1dimensional independent vectors uniformly distributed on @xmath57 then , the sum @xmath58 is a spherical vector and has stochastic representation@xmath59 where @xmath36 is uniform on @xmath57 now , by equation ( [ eq : rdistrib ] ) , the random variable @xmath38 is distributed as @xmath60 where @xmath61 this can be easily deduced from@xmath62 remarking that @xmath63 but @xmath64 is a random variable with q - gaussian distribution ! we prove this result by noticing that , conditioned to @xmath65 random variable @xmath64 is the angle between @xmath49 and the fixed direction @xmath66 since @xmath49 is spherical , we may restrict our attention to the angle between @xmath49 and the first vector of the canonical basis in @xmath67 so that we look for the distribution of the first component of @xmath49 , which follows a q - gaussian distribution with parameter @xmath68 such that @xmath69 since this distribution does not depend on our initial choice @xmath65 random variable @xmath64 follows unconditionally the above cited distribution .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath18dimensional marginal @xmath41 of vector @xmath70 is distributed as@xmath71 where @xmath6 is the @xmath18dimensional marginal vector of @xmath36 so that @xmath6 is again @xmath0gaussian with parameter @xmath72 moreover , this result extends to the case where @xmath42 and @xmath43 both have and @xmath43 have distinct covariance matrices is more difficult and left to further study ] a covariance matrix @xmath73 by multiplying vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 by matrix @xmath74 consequently , we have deduced the following    [ thm : sum]if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two q - gaussian independent random vectors in @xmath44 with covariance matrix @xmath16 and nonextensivity parameter @xmath9 and if hypothesis ( h ) holds then @xmath75 where @xmath6 is again q - gaussian with same covariance matrix @xmath16 and same nonextensive parameter @xmath13 as @xmath42 , and where@xmath76 the random variable @xmath64 being independent of @xmath6 and again q - gaussian distributed with nonextensive parameter @xmath68 defined by @xmath77    two remarks are of interest at this point :    * the univariate framework @xmath78 is the only case for which random variable @xmath64 has the same nonextensivity parameter @xmath68 as @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; * however , we note that @xmath79 this means that for large dimensional systems , the random variable @xmath64 converges to the constant @xmath80 and we recover the deterministic convolution ; this is coherent with the fact that large dimensional @xmath0gaussian vectors are `` close '' to gaussian vectors by de - finetti inequality .",
    "the curves in figure [ figure2 ] show the nonextensive parameter @xmath68 as a function of @xmath13 for several values of dimension @xmath81    [ figure2 ]     as a function of @xmath13 for dimensions @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( bottom to top ) ]    more can be said about the algebra @xmath84 :    [ thm : associative]the algebra @xmath84 defined as in ( [ eq : algebra ] ) is associative and for any @xmath85@xmath86 where random variables @xmath87 are q - gaussian .    as an example,@xmath88    by definition , @xmath89 since @xmath90 ,",
    "we deduce , by denoting @xmath91 , that @xmath92 by the same proof as above , we deduce that each @xmath93 is @xmath0gaussian distributed with parameter @xmath94 we remark that random variables @xmath95 are independent pairwise but are obviously not mutually independent .",
    "the preceding result was derived under the hypothesis ( h ) as expressed by ( [ eq : hypothesish ] ) , that is , for specific values of @xmath9 only ; we show in this section that this result holds in fact without this hypothesis - for all values of @xmath9 - but the proof requires more elaborate analytic tools .",
    "our main result is    [ thm : generalsum]theorem [ thm : sum ] holds for all values of @xmath13 such that @xmath96    the characteristic function associated to the @xmath0gaussian distribution ( [ eq : q<1gaussian ] ) is@xmath97 where @xmath98 is the bessel function of the first kind and with parameter @xmath99 where @xmath100 according to gegenbauer ( * ? ? ?",

    "let us recall the scaling behavior of gaussian vectors@xmath109 which can be probabilistically interpreted in the context of @xmath110stable distributions : a distribution @xmath111 is @xmath110stable if , for @xmath42 and @xmath43 independent with distribution @xmath111 , the linear combination@xmath112 where @xmath6 follows again distribution @xmath113 thus , a gaussian distribution is @xmath110stable with @xmath114 the result of thm.1 can be viewed as follows : @xmath0gaussians are not @xmath110stable ( unless @xmath115 which corresponds to the gaussian case @xmath116 ) ; however , their scaling behavior is close to the gaussian @xmath116 case , except for the fact that the scaling variable @xmath84 includes an additional random term @xmath64 .",
    "geometrically , the gaussian scaling factor @xmath117 can be interpreted , according to pythagoras theorem , as the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides of lengths @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath0gaussian case corresponds to a triangle for which the angle between @xmath118 and @xmath119 , let us call it @xmath120 , fluctuates around rectangularity .     in the gaussian case ( @xmath115 left ) ; in the @xmath0gaussian case ( left ) , @xmath121 is randomly chosen as one of the hypothenuses represented , the angle @xmath120 between sides @xmath122 and @xmath123 being distributed as shown on figure [ fig : fig1],title=\"fig : \" ] in the gaussian case ( @xmath115 left ) ; in the @xmath0gaussian case ( left ) , @xmath121 is randomly chosen as one of the hypothenuses represented , the angle @xmath120 between sides @xmath122 and @xmath123 being distributed as shown on figure [ fig : fig1],title=\"fig : \" ]    the distribution of the angle @xmath120 where @xmath104 is given by @xmath124 this distributions is shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] for values of the parameter @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( top to bottom ) .    the distribution of angle @xmath120 for values of the parameter @xmath127 and @xmath126 ( top to bottom ) . ]",
    "we remark that this distribution is symmetric around the angle @xmath128 and that , as @xmath129 the angle @xmath120 becomes deterministic and equal to @xmath130 .",
    "further , the usual scaling law for gaussian distributions ( [ eq : gaussiancase ] ) is recovered .",
    "we remark that formula ( [ eq : algebra ] ) exhibits a close resemblance with the interference formula for the amplitude of the superposition of two optical beams .",
    "interferometric optical testing is based on these phenomena of interference .",
    "two - beam interference is the superposition of two waves , such as the disturbance of the surface of a pond by a small rock encountering a similar pattern from a second rock .",
    "when two wave crests reach the same point simultaneously , the wave height is the sum of the two individual waves .",
    "conversely , a wave trough and a wave crest reaching a point simultaneously will cancel each other out .",
    "water , sound , and light waves all exhibit interference . a light wave can be described by its frequency , amplitude , and phase , and the resulting interference pattern between two waves depends on these properties , among others .",
    "our present interest lies in the two - beam interference equation .",
    "it gives the irradiance @xmath131",
    "@xcite for monochromatic waves of irradiance @xmath132 and @xmath133 in terms of the phase difference @xmath134 expressed as @xmath135 .",
    "we have    @xmath136 and , in terms of the @xmath137amplitudes @xmath138 , @xmath139 if the emission of the two beams could be so arranged that the phase difference becomes random @xcite , this physical analogy would be exact .",
    "the composition law @xmath141 has been studied in @xcite , in the more general case where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are independent , positive random variables .",
    "the associativity result is as follows    ( * ? ? ? *",
    "thm.1 ) the composition law @xmath140 is associative if and only if either @xmath144 or @xmath145 or @xmath146 where @xmath147 for some @xmath148    this theorem can be interpreted as follows : the only cases where the composition law @xmath140 is associative is    1 .   the gaussian case ( @xmath149 ) 2 .",
    "the cauchy case ( @xmath150 ) 3 .   the present @xmath0gaussian case with @xmath151    it is thus a remarkable property that the only cases of associativity of this composition law correspond to the whole range of @xmath0gaussian distributions with @xmath152 or to the cauchy case @xmath150 .",
    "we note moreover that in the limit case @xmath153 @xmath84 in ( [ eq : a1a2 ] ) reduces to a bernoulli random variable that takes values @xmath154 and @xmath155 with probability @xmath156      in the same spirit as the central limit theorem for the usual addition , a central limit theorem exists for the composition law @xmath140 .",
    "before we give its rigourous expression as established in @xcite , let us look at a special case of it based on the theory of superstatistics .",
    "let us consider the random walk@xmath157 where @xmath158 are independent @xmath0gaussian random variables with same variance @xmath159 and where @xmath45 since all @xmath158 have finite variance , the usual central limit theorem applies and @xmath160 but by theorems ( [ thm : associative ] ) and ( [ thm : generalsum ] ) , we have also@xmath161 with notation@xmath162 where @xmath6 is @xmath0gaussian with the same nonextensivity parameter @xmath72 since , by the superstatistics theory , a gaussian random variable @xmath163 can be decomposed as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is chi - distributed with @xmath23 degrees of freedom , we deduce that the following limit @xmath166 should hold .",
    "but this result is easy to check at least under hypothesis ( h ) : in this case , @xmath167 where @xmath168 where @xmath169 are independent and uniformly distributed on the sphere @xmath170 by the central limit theorem , @xmath171 where @xmath163 is a gaussian vector in @xmath172 ; hence @xmath173 converges indeed to a @xmath174 distributed random variable with @xmath23 degrees of freedom .",
    "it turns out that a much more general result holds , namely    @xcite if @xmath175 are positive , independent and identically distributed random variables with variance @xmath176 , then the composition @xmath177 where @xmath165 is a chi - distributed random variable enters the picture through the distribution of the random variable @xmath64 included in the composition law]with parameter @xmath178    this result can be considered as a central limit theorem for the algebra @xmath140 defined by ( [ eq : algebra ] ) .",
    "in this work we have uncovered interesting geometric aspects that underlie the sum @xmath179 of two stochastic variables @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 are scalars and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are @xmath18variate vectors ) .",
    "the alluded geometry becomes operative when the two variables are governed by @xmath0gaussian probability distributions with @xmath9 .",
    "we found that its sum @xmath179 turns out to be @xmath0gaussian with same nonextensivity parameter @xmath13 multiplied by an independent random factor @xmath84 . in turn , the random factor can be described as a random and symmetric mixture of the two constants @xmath142 and @xmath143 , the random factor involved following itself a @xmath0gaussian distribution .",
