    "we also briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for quiet sun loop heating models .",
    "this is of particular interest due to the large number of horizontal magnetic features in the photosphere , many of them associated with emerging magnetic loops @xcite and the lack of acoustic wave energy flux proposed by @xcite which inspires us to consider alternatives , although the recent work by @xcite suggests that the acoustic energy flux may well have been underestimated in the past due to insufficient spatial resolution .",

    "obviously the vertical field of both foot points for long loops ( reaching at least into the chromosphere ) is very different .",
