    "the 7-and-8 tev run ( run 1 ) of the lhc has been a great success , but no new physics ( np ) has emerged .",
    "the hint of np in the forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath7 decay  @xcite from the b factories was eliminated by lhcb  @xcite early on . the mild hint at the tevatron  @xcite for _ large _ @xmath3 violating ( cpv ) phase @xmath4 in @xmath8 mixing was also swiftly eliminated by lhcb  @xcite , vanquishing the suggested possible correlation  @xcite with large direct cpv difference @xmath9  @xcite . finally , the hot pursuit for @xmath10 at the tevatron culminated in the recent observation by the lhcb  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments , albeit again consistent with the standard model ( sm ) .    the combined lhc result for @xmath11 is  @xcite , @xmath12 at 6.2@xmath1 , the @xmath10 mode is established , but sm expectation is 7.6@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath13 mode deviates from sm expectation of @xmath14  @xcite by 2.2@xmath1 , with central value more than @xmath15 times the sm value .",
    "thus , @xmath13 should be keenly followed at the up and coming lhc run 2 ( 13 and 14 tev ) .",
    "the 1 fb@xmath16 lhcb update for @xmath4  @xcite is : @xmath17 which combines two results opposite in sign , @xmath18 eq .",
    "( [ eq : phis_lhcb-1 ] ) dominates the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) combination  @xcite of all experiments , @xmath19 adopted by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , and is in good agreement with sm value of @xmath20 .",
    "a preliminary result  @xcite of cms , @xmath21 is not included in pdg2014 , but is fully consistent .",
    "also not making pdg2014 is the 3 fb@xmath16 update by lhcb for @xmath22 with full run 1 data  @xcite , @xmath23 with sign change from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phis_lhcb-1-pipi ] ) , becoming same sign with eq .",
    "( [ eq : phis_lhcb-1-kk ] ) . because the analysis is done simultaneously with @xmath24 measurement , the @xmath25 mode took much longer .",
    "intriguingly , it also switched sign  @xcite , @xmath26 and the combined 3  fb@xmath16 result is , @xmath27 with no indication of new physics .",
    "a third measurement of interest by lhcb is the so - called @xmath28 anomaly .",
    "the significance ( 3.7@xmath1 ) , however , did not change from 1 fb@xmath16  @xcite to 3 fb@xmath16  @xcite .",
    "given that this is one out of many angular variables in @xmath29 , it remains to be seen whether the `` anomaly '' is genuine .",
    "unfortunately , it will take several years to accumulate and analyze an equivalent amount of data at run  2 .",
    "we note in passing the so - called @xmath30 anomaly  @xcite in lepton universality violation in @xmath31 decays , which has 2.6@xmath1 deviation from sm expectation .",
    "it may or may not be related to the @xmath28 anomaly .    what are the prospects for run 2 ?",
    "a total of @xmath32 fb@xmath16 or more data is expected by lhcb up to 2018 .",
    "data rate is much higher for cms , but trigger bandwidth is an issue . the belle  ii experiment should be completed in this time frame in japan .",
    "though not particularly competitive in @xmath4 and @xmath11 , it could crosscheck @xmath28 .",
    "given that the two former measurables correspond to @xmath33 and @xmath34 transitions , one involving cpv , the other not , there is one particular process that comes to mind : @xmath35 decays , which are @xmath36 transitions . the neutral @xmath37 decay , pursued by the koto experiment  @xcite in japan , is purely cpv .",
    "the charged @xmath38 mode is pursued by the na62 experiment  @xcite at cern .",
    "both experiments run within a similar time frame .",
    "if one has indications for np in @xmath11 and/or @xmath4 , likely one would find np in @xmath35 , and _",
    "vice versa_. an element of competition between high- and low - energy luminosity frontiers would be quite interesting .    in this letter",
    "we study the _ correlations _ between the measurables @xmath13 , @xmath10 , @xmath4 , and @xmath35 ( especially @xmath37 ) , in the 4th generation ( 4 g ) model , which can not address @xmath39 anomalies .",
    "it was pointed out quite some time ago  @xcite that 4 g can bring about an enhanced @xmath37 , and now that koto is running , one should check whether it remains true .",
    "although some may now find 4 g extreme , our aim is towards enhanced @xmath13 rate by a factor of three and still survive all _ flavor _ constraints .",
    "the issue with 4 g is the observation of a light higgs boson , without the anticipated factor of 9 enhancement in cross section . on one hand",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that there still exists other interpretation of this 125 gev boson , that is to identify it as dilaton from a 4 g theory with strong yukawa interaction . on the other hand , higgs boson",
    "practically does not enter ( i.e. is  orthogonal \" to ) low energy flavor changing processes , and , _ if _ one discovers an enhanced @xmath13 decay  @xcite , it may put some doubt on the higgs nature of the observed 125 gev particle .",
    "we view the issue , different interpretation of this boson , is still opens and would be settled by 2018 .",
    "our 4 g study serves to illustrate how new physics in @xmath11 , @xmath4 , and @xmath35 might be accommodated .    in what follows ,",
    "we give the formulas and data inputs , then our numerical results and end with some discussions .",
    "we define the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , with @xmath43 we adopt the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath44 ckm matrix , with convention and treatment of ref .",
    "in particular , we assume sm - like values for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with following input : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "this is a simplification , since we try to observe trends , rather than making a full fit .",
    "we find taking the `` exclusive '' measurement value for @xmath53 allows less enhancement range for @xmath54 .    having a 4th generation of quarks brings in three new angles and two new phases . in this paper",
    ", we take @xmath55 for sake of illustration , thereby fixing one of the angles . a second angle and",
    "one of the two phases are fixed by the discussion illustrated below .",
    "we are then left with two mixing parameters , and for our interest in @xmath35 decays , we take as @xmath56 and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdsphids ] ) .",
    "our choice  @xcite of @xmath58  gev is above the experimental bound  @xcite , which is beyond the nominal  @xcite unitarity bound .",

    "we adhere to sequential 4 g to reduce the number of parameters .      and @xmath59 gev .",
    "the pink - shaded contours correspond to 1(2)@xmath1 regions of @xmath60 allowed by @xmath61 mev while the green - shaded bands are for 1(2)@xmath1 in @xmath62  @xcite .",
