    "small quantum systems , whose properties are profoundly affected by environment , i.e. , continuum of scattering and decay channels , are intensely studied in various fields of physics ( nuclear physics , atomic and molecular physics , nanoscience , quantum optics , etc . ) . these different open quantum systems ( oqs ) , in spite of their specific features , have generic properties , which are common to all weakly bound / unbound systems close to the threshold .",
    "an essential part of the motion of short - lived nucleonic matter is in classically forbidden regions , and their properties are impacted by both the continuum and many - body correlations @xcite .",
    "resonances are commonly found in various quantum systems , independently of their building blocks .",
    "resonances are genuine intrinsic properties of quantum systems describing preferential decays of unbound states .",
    "the effect of resonances and the non - resonant scattering states can be considered in the oqs extension of the shell model ( sm ) , the so - called continuum shell model ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "two realizations of the csm have been studied recently : the real - energy csm @xcite and the complex - energy csm @xcite based on the berggren ensemble @xcite , the so - called gamow shell model ( gsm ) .    for hermitian hamilton operators , both real - energy csm @xcite and complex - energy csm ( gsm ) @xcite lead naturally to the non - hermitian ( complex - symmetric ) eigenvalue problem . as a result ,",
    "oqss exhibit several unintuitive properties , which make them qualitatively different from closed quantum systems ( cqs ) . among those salient features",
    "are : the segregation of time scales in the continuum @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , the alignment of near - threshold states with decay channels @xcite , the instability of sm eigenstates at the channel threshold @xcite , or the resonance crossings @xcite . in this lecture",
    ", we shall concentrate on the latter phenomenon which will be illustrated on the example of a non - integrable pairing model .",
    "most studies of degeneracies associated with avoided crossings in quantal spectra , focused on the topological structure of the hilbert space and the geometric phases @xcite . among these degeneracies ,",
    "one finds a diabolic point ( dp ) in hermitian hamiltonians @xcite , and an exceptional point ( ep ) @xcite , which appears in the complex @xmath0-plane of a generic hamiltonian @xmath1 , where both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are hermitian and @xmath4 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "below , we shall introduce a prototypical oqs , the 3-level richardson - gaudin ( rg ) model , to discuss the appearance of resonance crossings and their evolution with a parameter of a non - integrable perturbation .",
    "in particular , we shall show the appearance of a new kind of degeneracy , a pseudo - diabolic point ( pseudo - dp ) in the _ anti - hermitian _ limit of this model .",
    "rg models @xcite are based on the @xmath5 algebra with elements @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , fulfilling the commutation relations : @xmath9=\\delta_{ll^{\\prime } } k^0_l~$ ] , @xmath10=\\pm\\delta_{ll^{\\prime } } k^{\\pm}_l~$ ] , where indices @xmath11 refer to a particular copy from a set of @xmath12 , @xmath5 algebras .",
    "each @xmath5 algebra possesses one quantum degree of freedom . in the following",
    ", we shall use the pair representation of su(2 ) algebra leading to pairing hamiltonians .",
    "the elementary operators in this representation are the number operators @xmath13 and the pair operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 , defined as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total angular momentum and @xmath18 is the @xmath19-projection .",
    "the state @xmath20 is the time reversal of @xmath21 .",
    "the relation between the operators of the pair algebra and the generators of the su(2 ) algebra is : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the particle degeneracy of level @xmath24 . with this correspondence",
    ", one can introduce an integrable 3-level pairing hamiltonian as : @xmath25 below , we shall consider the non - integrable version of the 3-level pairing model @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a @xmath28-number .",
    "let us solve the non - integrable 3-level pairing model for the case of 2 pairs of fermions in a valence space of degeneracy @xmath41 .",
    "the energies of three levels are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . in this model space , there are 4 many - body states .    fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] shows the global pattern of level crossings in the complex @xmath0-plane for @xmath45 . in the lower half - plane of @xmath0 ,",
    "all eigenvalues are either discrete states at the real @xmath0-axis or decaying resonances .",
    "complex conjugate degeneracies situated in the upper half - plane ( @xmath46 ) correspond to capturing resonances .",
    "[ fig23 ] shows a typical pattern associated with the formation / breakup of the pseudo - dp at @xmath47 . with an increasing value of @xmath48 ,",
    "the two eps in the complex @xmath0-plane approach each other , coalesce at @xmath45 and , subsequently , move along the axis @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the coalescence of two eps at @xmath45 , leads to the formation of a double - root singularity , for which the geometric phase associated with a cyclic evolution changes twice faster than for the ep . on the other hand and in contrast to the ordinary dp , both eigenvalues _ and _ eigenvectors",
    "merge , like for an ordinary ep .",
    "the upper part of fig . [ fig24 ] shows real parts of phase trajectories around the pseudo - dp for all four eigenvectors in the model space . at the pseudo - dp , real part of their eigenenergies",
    "are identical .",
    "these trajectories in @xmath0-plane are described by : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 defines the way of encircling the degeneracy .",
    "the phase of each vector is defined with respect of its value at @xmath53 .",
    "the eigenvalues for vectors 2 and 3 are degenerate at the pseudo - dp and change their phases by @xmath54 at each encircling .",
    "simultaneously , phases of vectors for non - degenerate eigenvalues 1 and 4 remain approximately constant . for a comparison , the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig24 ] exhibits real parts of phase trajectories of all four vectors around the ep @xmath55 at @xmath56 ( see fig .",

    "eigenvalues for vectors 2 and 3 are degenerate at the ep .",
    "after first encircling of the ep they become exchanged . after a second encircling , the phases of vectors 2 and 3 change by @xmath54 , and after two more encircling of the ep all phases return to their initial values .",
    "the behavior of eigenenergies in the neighborhood of a pseudo - dp in complex @xmath0-plane are shown along the cut @xmath58 ( see fig . [ fig25 ] ) .",
    "the fusion of two eps and the formation of a single pseudo - dp is seen as a sharp crossing of four energies and a coalescence of two widths ( the eigenvectors 2 and 3 ) . even though phases of eigenvectors 1 and 4 are almost constant when encircling the pseudo - dp ( see fig .",
    "[ fig24 ] ) , they are essential for the formation of a pseudo - dp degeneracy . it can be shown rigorously , that the pseudo - dp does not result from the jordan block of 2-level system .",

    "( [ eigen ] ) ) have divergent components .",
    "this feature of eigenvectors at a pseudo - dp makes it similar to an ordinary ep and leads to a singular behavior of various quantities .",
    "let us consider for example the pairing operator : @xmath68 , in the neighborhood of a pseudo - dp for @xmath45 : @xmath69 coefficients @xmath70 in this expression are : @xmath71    it is readily seen that all matrix elements of the pairing operator involving states 2 and 3 exhibit the square - root divergence if @xmath64 , i.e. when approaching a pseudo - dp .",
    "this divergence is cancelled out if one adds diagonal pairing matrix elements for these two states .",
    "however , off - diagonal matrix elements between regular states ( states 1 and 4 in this case ) and any combination of states 2 and 3 are divergent because : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "dependence of a real part of the pairing energy on the interaction strength @xmath0 in the non - integrable pairing hamiltonian ( [ niph ] ) with @xmath45 is plotted along the cut at @xmath58 . pairing energies in strongly mixed eigenstates 2 and 3 have opposite signs and diverge when a pseudo - dp is approached , i.e. if @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sum of pairing energies in states 2 and 3 is both positive and finite and changes smoothly close to a pseudo - dp .",
    "these features of pairing energy in the neighborhood of a pseudo - dp are essentially different from those discussed in connection with effects of an ordinary dp on pair - transfer amplitude @xcite as the coupling between eigenvectors involved vanishes at the dp .",
    "besides accidental degeneracies , sharp level crossings in the hermitian eigenvalue problem are allowed only between states of different quantum numbers ( different symmetries ) . for the non - hermitian ( complex - symmetric )",
    "eigenvalue problem , such as found in oqss , exact eigenvalue degeneracies appear also for states of the same quantum numbers / symmetries .",
    "these are : ( i ) the dp , when riemann sheets on which live eigenvalues just touch each other @xcite , and ( ii ) the ep , when two riemann sheets are entangled by the square - root type of singularity @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed here features of degeneracies in the non - hermitian and non - integrable 3-level pairing model ( see eq .",
    "( [ niph ] ) which is a schematic representation of the oqs hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , we have shown the appearance of a new kind of degeneracy , the pseudo - dp , in the anti - hermitian limit of this model as a result of the coalescence between two eps .",
    "the resonance eigenfunctions at the pseudo - dp ( ep ) are entangled and , except for the ( complex ) eigenenergy , it is impossible to define any physical quantity separately in each of the two resonances involved in the pseudo - dp degeneracy .",
    "this entanglement of wave functions may involve many states of an oqs , leading to strong mixing of wave functions for states of largely different eigenenergies .",
    "this mechanism is efficient not only in the close neighborhood of a particular pseudo - dp ( ep ) , i.e. for a particular choice of coupling constants in the oqs hamiltonian , but also for systems with largely different coupling constants .",
    "future studies , using the csm and realistic effective interactions could provide a first attempt to provide a consistent description of continuum wave functions and related observables in the presence of a pseudo - dp ( ep ) .",
