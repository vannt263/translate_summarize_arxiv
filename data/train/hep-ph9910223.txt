    "one of the interesting cases of diagrams occurring in qcd and the standard model is of the propagator type with one mass and the external momentum on the mass shell ( the bubble ( vacuum ) type diagrams also belong to this class ) .",
    "only a limited number of analytical results is available in this case : the two- and three - loop diagrams occurring in qcd are given in refs.@xcite ; the analytical result for the two - loop bubble integral are presented up to the finite part in @xcite and the @xmath3 term in @xcite ; the finite part of three - loop bubble master integrals is calculated in @xcite ; the results for all other two - loop on - shell propagator type integrals with one mass are collected in @xcite .",
    "for some diagrams the results are available in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite . however , the @xmath0-expansion of hypergeometric functions is an independent and sometimes very complicated task .    at the same time",
    "a lot of different methods for numerical calculations of feynman diagrams are available now @xcite . from another point of view",
    "the development of numerical algorithms , in particular pslq @xcite , allows to determine with high confidence , whether or not particular numerical results for master - integrals can be expressed as a rational linear combination of several given transcendental constants .",
    "however , the problem arises of how to define the full set of the transcendental structure ( the `` basis '' ) occurring in given diagrams .",
    "the structure of massless multiloop integrals is well understood at the present time . in",
    "contains mainly the @xmath4-function @xcite and euler sums @xcite .",
    "recently the connection between knot theory and the transcendental structure of feynman diagrams was established @xcite . in more complicated case ,",
    "when dimensionless parameters exist , harmonic sums @xcite appeared . for studying the massive case , the differential equation method @xcite and geometrical approach @xcite can be useful .",
    "the aim of our investigation is to find the transcendental structure of single mass scale propagator type diagrams . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the consideration of diagrams with two particle massive cuts only .",
    "all our results are obtained empirically by carefully compiling and examining a huge data base on high precision ( about 200 decimals ) numerical calculation @xcite .",
    "our aim is to construct a basis ( the full set of transcendental numbers ) for single mass scale propagator type diagrams with two - particle massive cuts .",
    "the simplest diagrams of this type are shown in fig.[simple ] .",
    "an algebra for such a basis can be constructed as follows : the product of two basis elements having weights @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , must belong to the basis of weight @xmath7 .",
    "the weight of basis elements can be connected , e.g. , with powers of @xmath0 within the laurent expansion of dimensionally regularized @xcite feynman diagrams .    in constructing the basis of weight j",
    "we will use broadhurst s observation @xcite , that the sixth root of unity plays an important role in the calculation of the diagrams ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly we conjecture , that the basis of weight j contains functions obtained by splitting of polylogarithms @xmath8 into real and imaginary parts , where @xmath9 the general case , @xmath10 can be reduced to these two values @xcite .",
    "e.g. , with @xmath11 , the basis of weight @xmath12 must contain @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "not all of these functions are independent : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an arbitrary rational number ; @xmath17 .",
    "the basis we are going to construct is supposed to hold for any number of loops and arbitrary order of the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "consequently we connect the lowest weight basis elements with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which results in @xmath20 and @xmath21 . comparing this with the one - loop diagram of fig.[simple ] ( * ons11 * ) ,",
    "the expression given in @xcite allows us to find from its finite part the transcendental normalization factor @xmath22 , so that our lowest basis is given by @xmath23 and @xmath21 . in general the normalization factor @xmath22",
    "is introduced according to our experience .    using the above conjectures",
    ", we obtain the basis of higher weights : for weight * 2 * , e.g. , we have @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the results up to",
    "weight @xmath27 are presented in table i. some transcendental structures like , e.g. , @xmath28 do not appear in the table since they could be eliminated by means of relations given in @xcite .",
    "including weight * 3 * the relations found in @xcite were sufficient . for weight",
