    "a key question in astronomy today is whether the solar system s architecture is a typical outcome of planet formation processes .",
    "integral to this question is whether earth - like planets exist in other systems .",
    "however , the direct detection of terrestrial planets is difficult due to the limitations of current planet detection techniques .",
    "an alternative method for determining how the planet formation process proceeds around other stars is through observation of the remnants of these processes .",
    "current models of planet formation propose that dusty discs around a new star settle and km - sized planetesimals aggregate on a short ( @xmath51myr ) timescale @xcite .",
    "the largest planetestimals undergo runaway accretion followed by oligarchic growth resulting in tens or hundreds of 1000km - sized bodies in their own cleared `` feeding zones '' @xcite .",
    "these phases may take up to a few million years .",
    "finally these planetary embryos collide and merge in a chaotic growth phase to form a few stable terrestrial planets over 10 - 100myr ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "collisions between planetesimals produce second generation dust populations that absorb and re - radiate star light at wavelengths @xmath610@xmath0 m . in the absence of gas the lifetime of such dust",
    "is short ( @xmath51myr , see e.g. @xcite ) due to collisional destruction , stellar wind drag and radiation pressure forces ( poynting - robertson drag ) .",
    "the presence of a mid - infrared excess thus indicates a transient source or continuous replenishment of the dust population , a natural consequence of the ongoing growth and development of planetary systems .    the mips instrument on the _ spitzer space telescope _ allows the detection of 24@xmath0 m excess in nearby , young stars .",
    "excesses detected at 24@xmath0 m imply a temperature of 100 - 150k . assuming thermal equilibrium this translates to an offset of 3 - 30au around a and early f - type stars and 0.5 - 3au in f5-k5-type stars ( hereafter known as `` solar - type stars '' ) .",
    "these regions are precisely those in which we may expect to find planets .",
    "recent studies with spitzer have explored the evolution of 24@xmath0 m excess in a statistical manner ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . these studies have tried to answer the question of why two apparently similar stars can have very different levels of excess emission .",
    "to date , the clearest dependency is on age . in a and early f - type stars",
    "there is evidence for a peak in the upper envelope of excess emission at 10 - 20myr before a decay in proportion with time ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for",
    "solar - type stars the number of observed objects is smaller and so correlations are harder to establish .",
    "based on current evidence the decay of 24@xmath0 m excess around solar - type stars appears to follow a similar pattern to the a stars but on a timescale that is an order of magnitude shorter ( drop from 40% to 20% of stars with 24@xmath0 m excess occurs from 10 - 100myr for solar - type stars , and from 100 - 500myr for a - type stars , see figure 6 of @xcite ) . in general the levels of excess emission",
    "are also smaller around lower mass objects ( @xmath52 times the photosphere ) apart from around the youngest sources .",
    "these results can be interpreted within the framework of the evolutionary models of kenyon and bromley ( @xcite ) .",
    "these suggest that planetesimals take longer to form at 10 - 30au around a - type stars than at @xmath71au around g - type stars , and thus there are copious dust producing collisional events for 10 - 100myr during planetesimal accretion . around solar - type stars",
    "100km - sized embryos may be complete within a few myr , and thus subsequent observed debris is likely to have been produced in recent catastrophic collisions like the impact that formed the earth - moon system ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    within this framework we would expect to find small or no excess emission around most solar - type stars with occasional high excess resulting from a recent massive collision in the terrestrial planet zone ( evidence for an earth - moon type collision has been presented around the @xmath712myr old star hd172555 , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of these collisions are expected in the age range 10 - 50myr ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of excess depends on the frequency of impacts and the timescale for removal of the resulting dust from the system , which is in turn dependent on the dust particle size distribution .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of the debris disc population of the open cluster ic 4665 ( 370@xmath150pc @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster has reddening of @xmath8mag (; - corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the intrinsic colours of a low mass pms star , @xcite ) .",
    "open clusters provide a homogeneous , chemically uniform coeval population for which debris disc incidence rates can be calculated .",
    "ic 4665 is one of only 5 clusters to have an age measured using the lithium depletion boundary giving a more accurate age determination than from h - r diagram analysis .",
    "the determined age of 27@xmath15 myr @xcite makes it a prime target for studying the debris disc population during the period of terrestrial planet formation .    in this paper",
    "we describe spitzer irac and mips 24@xmath0 m photometry of confirmed members of ic 4665 .",
    "we determine those stars with excess 24@xmath0 m emission based on their position in a @xmath11 vs. @xmath12 colour - colour diagram and on sed fitting .",
    "we discuss how the rates and levels of excess emission compare with other studies of solar - type stars and how these observations constrain models of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "our primary aim in this study is to determine the disc population in the solar - type stars in ic 4665 .",
    "we base our sample on the study by @xcite who used fibre spectroscopy to establish cluster membership from a sample of 452 photometric candidates .",
    "membership was assessed primarily from radial velocity , giving a candidate list of 56 stars .",
    "this was further refined through measurements of ca  i lines at 6439 and 6463 to filter out contamination by k - giants .",
    "mean proper motions for 45 of the candidate stars ( taken from the nomad database , @xcite ) are -0.7 @xmath1 1.0 mas yr@xmath13 in ra and -6.2 @xmath1 0.8 mas yr@xmath13 in dec .",
    "two stars were found to have proper motions incompatible with cluster membership at the 3@xmath14 level .",
    "a final sample of 40 candidates were confirmed as low mass cluster members . for these targets we used the 2mass catalogue @xcite to determine the @xmath15 band magnitude of the targets .",
    "temperatures were taken from @xcite .",
    "these sources are listed in table [ tab : samplejef ] .    to complement the low mass sample we searched the tycho catalogue @xcite for higher mass candidate members within a 1 degree radius of the center of our spitzer observations at @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( see section [ s : data ] for details of the observed region ) .",
    "a candidate list of 132 stars with 6 @xmath5 v @xmath5 12 were selected .",
    "this list was refined firstly by excluding candidates with proper motions incompatible with the mean cluster proper motion ( at the 3@xmath14 level as determined by @xcite ) .",
    "this reduced the candidate high mass population to 41 stars .",
    "this list was further reduced by examination of the source colours in a @xmath18 vs @xmath19 colour - magnitude diagram ( figure [ fig : brightcand ] ) .",
    "we adopt a 30myr old isochrone from @xcite .",
    "seven stars are found to have colours incompatible with cluster membership , and our final list of additional bright targets comprises of 33 members .",
    "we further add to our list the solar - type targets p39 and p155 from the study of ic 4665 by @xcite .",
    "these targets were identified as possible members based on their radial velocities and were not excluded by @xcite but not observed by them spectroscopically .",

    "as first suggested by @xcite , the inverse time - squared dependence seems to offer the best fit to the upper envelope of excess for the upper scorpious and lower centaurus crux members of the scorpius - centaurus association ( data from @xcite ) , but the inverse time dependence is a better fit to the rest of the data . an inverse time dependence has also been shown to fit a star debris disc statistics @xcite .",
    "this agrees with predictions for steady - state evolution of debris discs , in which the excess emission arising from the debris discs falls inversely in proportion to time .",
    "this @xmath29 fall - off arises once the debris reaches a collisional equilibrium in which the largest bodies in the population are colliding and producing smaller material which is eventually collisionally processed into dust small enough to be removed from the system ( @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the 30myr old cluster ngc 2547 the excess levels seen in ic 4665 show a similar spread apart from the presence of one high excess source in ngc 2547 , 2mass 08090250 - 4858172 ( labelled i d 8 in @xcite ; this source has excess emission from 3@xmath0 m and is possibly a primordial optically thick disc ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the inverse time dependence .",
    "we find no sources that exceed this envelope and could be considered to have dust resulting from a transient event as has been postulated for hd69830 and bd+20307 @xcite .",
    "extreme levels of excess could be interpreted as evidence for a recent massive collision such as those expected between proto - planets in the final stages of terrestrial planet accretion @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite have shown that at an age of 27myr a collisional cascade in a minimum - mass solar nebula around a solar - type star at 0.42au would be above our detection threshold , and so could be a valid model for the emission we detect .",
    "similarly around higher mass stars the emission could arise from a collisional cascade at 320au or 30150au . with a single photometric detection for most of these targets we can not constrain either the location or the mass of the dust ,",
    "however these models show that a collisional cascade produced by catastrophic collisions in a disc is a possible model for the emission seen here .",
    "we can also consider the relative proportions of different levels of excess in the clusters studied .",
    "we follow the example set by @xcite who showed the rates of low , intermediate and high excess fractions as a function of time to explore the decay of debris discs around a stars .",
    "we split the samples for each cluster into small or no excess ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the expected flux from the stellar photosphere ) , intermediate excess ( @xmath32 ) , and large excess ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "these are plotted as a function of age in figure [ fig : xs_levels ] .",
    "the general pattern of excess is similar to that seen around a stars , with the proportion of targets having low or no excess ( @xmath30 ) increasing with age , and the proportion of sources with intermediate excess being higher than those with large excess ( @xmath33 ) for all but the youngest sub - sample ( compare with figure 3 of @xcite and figure 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the evolution of debris around both solar - type stars and more massive stars follows a similar pattern , although the timescale is an order of magnitude longer for more massive stars ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "fraction of stars with low or no excess ( @xmath30 ) , intermediate excess ( @xmath34 ) and high excess ( @xmath35 ) for each of the cluster samples listed in table [ tab : cluster ] .",
    "the overall trend agrees well with the a stars as shown in figure 3 of @xcite and figure 9 of @xcite .",
    "the distribution of excess for the ic 4665 cluster presented in this paper ( shown at 27 myr ) is somewhat different from the other cluster of a similar age , ngc 2547.,width=317 ]    we can also see in figure [ fig : xs_levels ] that ic 4665 and ngc 4547 which are of the similar age appear to have somewhat different distributions .",
    "a higher proportion of the sources in ic 4665 have intermediate levels of excess ( @xmath36 ) than for any other cluster ( although not significantly so ) .",
    "consequently the proportion of sources with no or low excess ( @xmath30 ) is lower than the other published clusters ( again not significantly so ) .",
    "if assume that the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) predictions from @xcite for the evolution of debris in the final stages of terrestrial planet formation can be applied to our cluster data , then the frequency of discs with intermediate excess in ic 4665 would suggest that many stars in the cluster have recently experienced a large collision .",
    "however , as the initial planetesimal discs may have differed from a mmsn then we can not confirm this is the case .",
    "+    to further test whether the distribution of excess emission in ic 4665 is different to other sources we examine the cumulative distribution functions of the excess emission of each cluster .",
    "the resulting normalised distributions are shown in figure [ fig : cum_freq ] .",
    "as we can see here the older clusters and the field have very similar distribution functions , which are somewhat different to the younger sources shown in the left - hand plot .",
    "this is to be expected if the evolutionary timescale for debris discs is of the order of 10 - 100myr .",
    "the cumulative frequency ( cf ) distribution for ic 4665 has some differences to the cf distribution of ngc 2547 , however a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates that the probability that the two cluster samples are drawn from the same underlying probability distribution is still 76% .",
    "the probability that the ic 4665 and sco cen samples are drawn from the same distribution is 26% .",
    "this is not low enough to confirm a significant difference between the clusters , although the cf distribution looks quite different .",
    "there is evidence that the underlying distribution could be different for the older samples .",
    "a k - s test comparing ic 4665 to these samples returns a probability that the underlying distributions are the same of 8% ( blanco 1 , 100myr ) , 1% ( pleiades , 115myr ) , 0.04% ( hyades , 625myr ) and 0.02% ( field sample , average age 4000myr ) .",
    "this provides further support for evolution of debris discs on 10 - 100myr timescales .",
    "we find no evidence of a link between binarity and excess seen in ic 4665 .",
    "a binary companion limits the size of a stable region for a circumbinary disc to @xmath37 , a function of the binary s configuration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this limit also approximately corresponds to the region in which the final chaotic stages of planet formation from lunar - sized embryos can proceed @xcite .",
    "this truncation of planet formation in binaries is of particular interest given the recent discoveries of @xmath7 80 exoplanets in binary systems ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of dust grains in so - called forbidden regions ( @xmath38 ) found for several binary systems by @xcite may be explained by recent numerical simulations in @xcite who found that small grains can populate the forbidden region .",
    "the amount of dust in unstable regions depends on the balance between the rate of small grain production through collisions and removal by the perturbations of the binary . as discussed in section 4.3",
    "several studies have offered contradictory evidence for a link between multiplicity and the presence of a debris disc ( @xcite ) . with the wealth of seemingly contradictory conclusions about the relationship between binarity and debris disc incidence further studies , in particular exploring the geometry of the binary system and the true dust distributions to remove degeneracies from sed fitting , are needed .",
    "for example the two likely binary sources in ic4665 with significant excess ( jc02_373 and jc08_257 ) could be wide binaries ( several hundered au ) which would not be resolved in the spitzer observations and would not be expected to affect the presence of 24@xmath0 m excess .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the cluster ic 4665 using spitzer irac and mips data .",
    "these data have been used to search for debris discs in the cluster .",
    "our conclusions are :    * the cluster ic 4665 has the highest incidence of 24@xmath0 m excess in the spectral range f5-k5 of all the clusters studied with spitzer to date , although the rate ( @xmath39% ) is not significantly higher than the similarly aged ngc 2547 ( @xmath40% ) .",
    "the majority of the sources in the cluster have low or intermediate levels of excess @xmath3 .",
    "no sources in ic 4665 have excess above the levels expected for an inverse time decay of debris predicted by collisional evolution models ; * the source tyc424 - 473 - 1 , which may be a binary , has excess in all unsaturated observations indicative of excess emission from the near to mid - infrared .",
    "such near - infrared excess could indicate the presence of a remnant primordial disc .",
    "this excess can be fit by a simple blackbody curve at a temperature of 500k suggesting a radial offset of @xmath71.7au from the star ; * there is no evidence of a dependence of excess at 24@xmath0 m on multiplicity of the star in this cluster .",
    "we find several sources which are suspected multiples that have significant 24@xmath0 m excess , but as the numbers are small these do not provide contradictory evidence against the recent work by @xcite who found evidence that 24@xmath0 m excess is reduced around multiple stars in other clusters . more work to explore the nature of the multiple stars , in particular",
    "to determine the system geometry and the location and distribution of dusty debris in these systems is necessary to determine the nature of any link between excess and multiplicity .",
