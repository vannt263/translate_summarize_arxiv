    "in the last few years , observational data from planck and bicep have sparked renewed interest in models of large - field inflation .",
    "although evidence for cosmological tensor perturbations in the cmb is still elusive , present measurements allow for relatively large values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 .",
    "models of inflation with large @xmath1 typically point to trans - planckian field excursions of the inflaton . in a trans - planckian regime",
    "one can no longer ignore effects of quantum gravity , so that some ultraviolet completion of the theory is needed .",
    "string theory is the most promising candidate for such a completion , and it is thus natural to examine whether large - field inflation may be obtained in a controlled regime of string compactifications . among the vast literature on large - field inflation models from string theory , cf .",
    "@xcite for recent compilations of references , axion monodromy inflation @xcite is a particularly intriguing idea . here",
    "trans - planckian field excursions may be naturally obtained , while the stability of the potential is protected by discrete shift symmetries inherent to string compactifications .",
    "the most obvious inflaton candidates in string theory come in two classes : first , closed - string moduli and the complex dilaton and second , open - string moduli .",
    "explicit models with all required ingredients that yield sufficient @xmath2-folds of slow roll in agreement with observations , and at the same time feature a stable potential in all perpendicular directions , are notoriously difficult to construct .",
    "this is not surprising since every model of string inflation must address the problem of moduli stabilization . in models with open - string moduli",
    "the inflaton typically parametrizes the position of a d@xmath3-brane in the compact space , or the value of a continuous wilson line .",
    "one of the examples considered recently involves position moduli of d7-branes in type iib orientifold compactifications @xcite .",
    "a particular minimal model within this class is higgs - otic inflation @xcite , in which the d7-brane position moduli correspond to the higgs scalars of an mssm - like string compactification .",
    "this is particularly attractive because it identifies the inflaton with a known particle and aspects like reheating follow quite naturally .",
    "although the model includes two neutral inflaton fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , it was shown in @xcite that isocurvature perturbations are exponentially supressed by the end of inflation , consistent with observations .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the study of large - field d7-brane inflation models , with particular emphasis on the higgs - otic benchmark . as of now",
    ", this model has been studied mostly from a local perspective based on the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) and chern - simons ( cs ) actions of the d7-branes involved .",
    "isd three - form fluxes in the background yield a monodromy and a mass term for the higgs field , which implies a quadratic inflaton potential . however , this potential is flattened at large field values due to nontrivial kinetic terms arising from the dbi action .",
    "this leads to an approximately linear potential in the large - field regime , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "still , a fully realistic global model requires further ingredients .",
    "in particular , a consistent embedding of the d7-brane system requires a global compactification with stabilized moduli .",
    "therefore , the aim of the present paper is to include the effects of moduli stabilization on the inflationary dynamics of higgs - otic inflation .",
    "moduli stabilization in type iib is best understood in terms of its low - energy @xmath7 supergravity theory , cf .",
    "thus , we need an @xmath8 description of the microscopic setup leading to higgs - otic inflation , including sources which stabilize all moduli . as pointed out in @xcite , one of the challenges",
    "is to reproduce the nontrivial kinetic term of the d7-brane from the dbi action . in that reference",
    "we have shown that , with only isd three - form flux and in the global limit , the kinetic terms can be expressed in terms of a specific higher - derivative correction to the khler potential .",
    "we argue here that , while the corresponding correction can be found and computed also in local supersymmetry , the identification of the correct operator is much more difficult once iasd fluxes are considered .",
    "the latter are necessary to describe non - perturbative contributions in the superpotential , which in turn are needed to stabilize khler moduli .",
    "however , even in this case the correct kinetic term can be found by expanding the dbi action  after including those additional fluxes  and expressing the result in terms of the correct supergravity variables .    in order to study moduli stabilization itself and its backreaction on the inflaton , we first consider a simplified kklt - like setup in which the dilaton and complex structure moduli are stabilized supersymmetrically by fluxes and already integrated out .",
    "a single overall khler modulus is then stabilized by non - perturbative effects and an appropriate de sitter uplift @xcite .",
    "it turns out that there are important backreaction effects which substantially modify the structure of the inflaton scalar potential once the khler modulus is stabilized and integrated out . similar to our analysis here , the backreaction of stabilized moduli was studied in @xcite for supersymmetric stabilization , and in @xcite for the kklt mechanism and other models in which the khler moduli break supersymmetry .",
    "eventually , the modulus backreaction leads to an additional flattening of the effective potential , @xmath9 . at the same time",
    ", the background fluxes must be chosen such that the mass of the inflaton is much smaller than that of the modulus . if this can be achieved , 60 or more @xmath2-folds of slow - roll inflation are possible .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio then lies in the range @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the backreaction induced by the khler moduli , there could be a backreaction from the complex structure and dilaton . in @xcite , for example , such a backreaction feeding into the kinetic term of the inflaton was argued to severely limit the canonical field range , putting large - field inflation under pressure .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , this problem seems to be particularly severe in models where the inflaton is a closed - string axion .",
    "therefore , it is a natural question to ask whether the arguments of @xcite apply when the inflaton is an open - string scalar . based on simple toy models , we find that the constraints are far less severe in higgs - otic inflation , as advanced in @xcite .",
    "although a similar backreaction affects the kinetic term of the inflaton , the reduction of the canonical field range can be tuned by a flux choice , due to additional freedom not present in the models of @xcite .    in summary , we present a model of large - field inflaton with full moduli stabilization .",
    "we find that the heavy moduli affect the simple structure of the higgs - otic model studied in previous works , cf .",
    "@xcite , by inducing extra contributions to the scalar potential and kinetic terms .",
    "the most important effect arises from the backreaction of the khler moduli , which induces an additional flattening .",
    "this typically implies smaller values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 .",
    "although backreaction from complex structure moduli and dilaton may induce a reduction of the possible inflaton excursion , in the case of an open - string inflaton there is more freedom in the choice of flux parameters , allowing for trans - planckian excursions large enough to obtain successful inflation .",
    "the structure of the rest of this paper is as follows . in the next section we review and extend some of the general aspects of the action of d7-brane position moduli as present in the higgs - otic system .",
    "in particular , we generalize the results discussed in @xcite to include the dbi and cs actions in the presence of both isd and iasd fluxes .",
    "we identify the correct kinetic term of the inflaton in the presence of iasd fluxes , which leads to a flattening of the potential in the supergravity picture .",
    "moreover , we comment on the possibility of describing this extended system in @xmath11 supergravity with higher - order derivative operators . in section 3",
    "we combine the higgs - otic open - string system with a single khler modulus in a kklt - like setting .",
    "we study the associated backreaction on the inflaton potential following the analysis in @xcite , and show that , for an appropriate choice of flux parameters , consistent slow - roll inflation is achieved with a stable khler modulus .",
    "moreover , we translate the nontrivial kinetic terms to the supergravity language and give numerical examples with the predicted cmb observables of the canonical inflaton variable . in section 4",
    "we investigate an additional backreaction induced by the complex structure moduli and the dilaton .",
    "using flux stabilization as in @xcite , we show that the inflaton field range is almost unaffected when an appropriate mass hierarchy between the inflaton and moduli is achieved via a flux choice  just as in the khler sector . in section 5 we review and discuss the different assumptions under which these results are obtained .",
    "in particular , we discuss the viability of the required flux tuning .",
    "we leave section 6 for our conclusions .",
    "finally , in appendix a we illustrate that moduli - stabilizing fluxes may also yield @xmath0-terms for open - string moduli in a simple toroidal orientifold setting .",
    "higgs - otic inflation @xcite is a recent proposal to realize large - field inflation in type iib string theory .",
    "we begin this section with a brief review of the model and the underlying compactification .",
    "we then extend the original setup by including iasd fluxes , in order to describe non - perturbative superpotentials from gaugino condensation .",
    "these are important in section [ sec : kms ] once we discuss khler moduli stabilization .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : hdo ] we discuss possibilities to describe the dbi action and higgs - otic inflation in higher - derivative @xmath8 supergravity , extending the results of @xcite .",
    "one of the original setups of @xcite is a type iib compactification with @xmath12/@xmath13-planes and rr and ns three - form fluxes .",
    "these fluxes give rise to a monodromy potential for the position moduli of space - time filling d7-branes .",
    "in particular , the model features a compact orientifold with a local geometry of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is some complex two - fold which is wrapped by a stack of d7-branes sitting at the singularity . in the example of @xcite , the @xmath16 gauge theory on the worldvolume of the branes contains the matter and higgs sectors of the mssm .",
    "most importantly , some of the d7-branes may leave the singularity and travel through the bulk around the two - torus @xmath17 still satisfying tadpole cancellation conditions . when this happens a d - flat direction  lifted only by turning on fluxes  may give rise to inflation . the inflaton candidate in this case",
    "is the position modulus @xmath18 of the mobile branes , which may be an mssm higgs boson .",
    "the aforementioned three - form fluxes are the isd components of @xmath19 .",
    "we distinguish between the @xmath20-form flux @xmath21 and the @xmath22-form flux @xmath23 . the first class , @xmath24 , breaks supersymmetry in the vacuum and gives rise to soft terms .",
    "the second class , on the other hand , gives rise to @xmath0-terms in the @xmath25 superpotential .",
    "as we are interested in the dynamics of the fields on the branes , let us consider the corresponding dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) and chern - simons ( cs ) actions . in einstein frame and the notation of @xcite they read    [ eq : s1 ] @xmath26)+\\sigma f_{mn}}\\right ) \\",

    "we use the gauge - invariant combination @xmath37 in the definition of the action only .",
    "for now we are not interested in worldvolume fluxes and matter fields coming from wilson lines , so we ignore @xmath36 in the following .",
    "finally , str denotes the symmetrized trace over gauge indices .",
    "the four - dimensional action for the position moduli can be obtained by performing the pullback of the metric , expanding the determinant , and integrating over the compact four - cycle wrapped by the brane .",
    "the brane worldvolume is parameterized by @xmath38 and the worldvolume fields only feel the local closed string background around the brane , so all quantities in can be expanded in terms of the fluctuations of the transverse real fields @xmath39 as follows , @xmath40 to yield the desired action . here",
    "@xmath41 denotes the warp factor , @xmath42 is the complex axio - dilaton , and @xmath43 in terms of the usual rr and nsns flux .",
    "moreover , we define the complex scalar field that is the inflaton candidate as the following combination of the transverse coordinates , @xmath44 . instead of reproducing the results of @xcite",
    ", we derive the four - dimensional action for @xmath18 in section [ sec : iasd ] after including iasd flux .",
    "since our goal is to stabilize all relevant closed string moduli in higgs - otic inflation , we must consider extensions of the original setup in @xcite , in which only isd fluxes were included .",
    "any further ingredient of the global compactification is parameterized in terms of the local background around the brane .",
    "therefore , we must consider a local background rich enough to account for all further ingredients required to achieve moduli stabilization in our type iib compactification .",
    "one missing ingredient is non - perturbative superpotentials  required to stabilize , for example , khler moduli . in @xcite it was shown that such non - perturbative terms from gaugino condensation source iasd flux in the bulk of the compactification . hence , in the following , we consider the additional contribution of @xmath45-form flux @xmath46 .",
    "the dbi action can then be written as follows .",
    "after performing the pullback , computing the trace , expanding the square root in powers of @xmath47 , and integrating over the wrapped four - cycle one obtains @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the volume of the wrapped four - cycle .",
    "we have assumed , for simplicity , that the internal four - cycle wrapped by the brane is ricci flat so that the internal profile of the worldvolume fields is trivial .",
    "the ellipsis denotes higher - order terms in @xmath47 , which are sub - leading during slow - roll inflation .",

    "we have been relying on the expectation that states with masses much larger than the hubble scale which do not break supersymmetry decouple from the dynamics of inflation @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it was found that in certain type ii compactifications backreaction of the complex structure moduli may impair large - field inflation @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this can happen whenever the field space metric of the inflaton , in our case @xmath263 with @xmath148 denoting the canonical distance in field space and @xmath264 , depends on moduli which are displaced during inflation .",
    "in our case this applies to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , but not to @xmath87 .",
    "concretely , since @xmath265 is a function of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath266 to leading order , the canonical distance in field space is modified whenever @xmath85 and @xmath86 are stabilized such that their expectation value during inflation is @xmath267-dependent . as",
    "this is to be expected in most moduli stabilization scenarios , like for @xmath87 in section [ sec : kms ] , we should treat the stabilization of all moduli explicitly . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that in many type ii compactifications involving closed - string moduli only , one indeed has schematically @xmath268 where @xmath267 is a light linear combination of closed - string fields .",
    "moreover , it was shown that beyond a critical inflaton field value where @xmath269 the canonical field distance only increases logarithmically with @xmath267 . depending on the critical value @xmath270 , defined by @xmath271 ,",
    "this can make large - field inflation impossible .",
    "however , even if the critical field value , and thus the point where the logarithmic dependence dominates , can be tuned large by a flux choice , in the setups of @xcite large - field inflation is under pressure : by tuning @xmath270 large , @xmath272 and @xmath273 are tuned large as well . due to the inverse dependence in the khler metric , this leads to a suppression of the canonical field distance as well .",
    "if both @xmath270 and @xmath274 parametrically depend on the fluxes in the same way , both effects cancel each other and the canonical field range can not be larger than the planck scale .    in this section we demonstrate that these problems are less severe in higgs - otic inflation .",
    "we stabilize @xmath85 and @xmath86 via @xmath19 fluxes as in @xcite and compute the minimum values explicitly .",
    "we show that the fluxes allow for enough freedom to tune @xmath270 large while , at the same time , leaving @xmath272 and @xmath273 approximately unchanged , so the backreaction effects can be delayed in field space .",
    "this flexibility , coming from the introduction of open - string fields , was also discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we aim to make the qualitative arguments given in @xcite more explicit and analyze in detail the resulting back - reacted metric in higgs - otic inflation .",
    "to illustrate these findings we present an analytic study of a useful toy model which is , however , phenomenologically incomplete due to the presence of a flat direction .",
    "afterwards , we turn to a numerical study of a more complete model with full moduli stabilization . in the remainder of this section",
    "we neglect the explicit stabilization and backreaction of the khler modulus @xmath87 , which has been analyzed in detail in section [ sec : kms ] .",
    "as discussed above , it only affects the scalar potential and is irrelevant for the backreaction in the kinetic terms .",

    "while this does not change the analysis of section [ sec : kms ] , it accounts for the fact that the compact orientifold in this case is isotropic : we have taken the two - fold @xmath15 to be a four - torus and have identified the three complex structure moduli of the two - tori . for the moment , we assume that the d7-brane position moduli are stabilized by the presence of ( 2,1)-fluxes as explained in section 2 , inducing a superpotential term parameterized by @xmath0 . here",
    "we treat @xmath0 as an independent parameter and discuss its microscopic origin in terms of ns fluxes in the next section .",
    "furthermore , we consider only the imaginary self - dual piece of @xmath19 , so that @xmath280 in the vacuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the flux potential is non - vanishing in the vacuum , so that supersymmetry is broken and @xmath189 .",
    "after no - scale cancellation we are thus interested in vacua of the scalar potential @xmath281 where @xmath109 and @xmath282 label the fields @xmath18 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the fluxes in this example are only sufficient to stabilize three out of the four real scalar directions .",
    "decomposing @xmath283 and @xmath284 we find the following solutions to the f - term constraints in the vacuum at @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 is a free parameter . during inflation , there is again an interaction between the inflaton @xmath267 and the complex structure moduli .",
    "this leads to a modification of the solutions during inflation , @xmath288 whereas @xmath287 remains unfixed .",

    "thus , by introducing a hierarchy between the mass of the inflaton and the masses of the moduli , we can suppress the displacement compared to the vacuum value of the field .",
    "in other words , we can increase the critical value @xmath270 .",
    "this can be achieved by tuning @xmath0 to small values compared to @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "at the same time , this tuning of fluxes does not necessarily affect the vacuum expectation values in in the same way .",
    "@xmath0 does not enter in , so one can achieve such a mass hierarchy without changing @xmath290 .",
    "this is different than in the setups considered in @xcite , where @xmath270 and @xmath290 had the same parametric dependence on the fluxes .",
    "let us now consider the backreaction on the canonical metric in field space during inflation .",

    "however , the point at which the backreaction dominates is flux - dependent , and the canonical field distance travelled before that point , _ c = , can be tuned larger than @xmath88 by generating a mass hierarchy between @xmath292 and @xmath267 , as we explained above .    in summary",
    ", this toy model produces the following result .",
    "while the integration of the field space metric does lead to a logarithmic dependence of @xmath148 on @xmath267 for large field values , the point where the logarithm is relevant can be moved far out in field space by a tuning of fluxes .",
    "of course , the fact that @xmath287 is not stabilized in this setup is a big caveat : we have no means of evaluating the displacement and backreaction of @xmath287 on the possible field space .",
    "the above arguments only apply to @xmath292 .",
    "furthermore we have not considered the microscopic origin of @xmath0 , which could also affect the closed - string fields .",
    "this is why , in the following , we use additional fluxes to stabilize @xmath287 and analyze all backreactions simultaneously .",
    "a numerical analysis reveals results that are qualitatively the same as in this simple toy model , so the intuition and conclusions reached in this example do not change by considering a more complicated setup .      to obtain an inflationary theory in which all moduli are stabilized",

    "we also need to identify the microscopic origin of the @xmath0-term yielding a mass for the d7-brane position moduli . in the type iia dual theory involving a wrapped d6-brane",
    "one can show that a geometric flux sourcing the term @xmath293 also induces a supersymmetric mass for the open - string modulus in question .",
    "this geometric flux in iia corresponds to an ns flux on the type iib side , and the complexified d6 open - string modulus is mapped to the d7 position modulus in the transverse torus . for more details we refer the reader to appendix  [ app : muterm ] .",
    "let us consider the following effective theory    @xmath294- \\log \\left [ ( u+ \\bar u ) ( s + \\bar s ) - \\frac12 ( \\phi + \\bar \\phi)^2 \\right ] - 3 \\log(2 t_0)\\ , , \\\\ w & = \\mu \\phi^2 + e_0 + i e_1 u + i m u^3 + i h_0 s + \\mu s",

    "however , in more elaborate examples with different complex structure moduli for the three two - tori , @xmath300 , this is not necessarily true .",
    "for instance , the position modulus of a tilted d7-brane transverse to one - dimensional cycles of different two - tori feels the presence of ns flux in both two - tori .",
    "thus the coefficient for the @xmath0-term of @xmath18 would be a combination of several ns fluxes .",

    "moreover , the masses of all four real scalars contained in @xmath85 and @xmath86 are mostly independent of @xmath0 . to illustrate this",
    ", we can plot the five mass eigenvalues of interest ( @xmath112 is set to zero and plays no role in this discussion ) numerically as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we fix all flux parameters except @xmath0 to a set of @xmath303 numbers , and vary @xmath0 between @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "we choose @xmath306 as a parameter example .",
    "note that this is equivalent to fixing @xmath0 to an @xmath108 number and varying the remaining parameters to be much larger .",
    "what counts is the relative size of @xmath0 compared to the rest of the flux quanta .",

    "as advertised , the lightest eigenstate has a mass which scales as @xmath0 , while the other four eigenstates are much heavier and do not depend on @xmath0 as long as there is a moderate hierarchy between @xmath0 and the remaining flux quanta .",
    "this means that , within the flux setup we can tune the masses of the moduli and the inflaton independently .",
    "moreover , we can check that the vacuum expectation values of the moduli are almost independent of @xmath0 .",
    "we have displayed the four vacuum expectation values ( at @xmath301 ) in figure [ fig : vevs1 ] , for the same set of flux quanta and the same parameter range of @xmath0 .     with the parameters in , as well as @xmath307 and @xmath301 . the plot is double - logarithmic .",
    "the value of the axion of @xmath86 is negative in this example , and therefore is invisible in the logarithmic plot . for small values of @xmath0 the expectation values are independent of @xmath0 , contrary to the findings in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : vevs1 ] ]    these results are thus completely analogous to those of the toy model in section [ sec : toyflat ] : we can tune the fluxes to obtain a mass hierarchy between the inflaton and the closed - string fields without barely modifying the vacuum expectation values of the latter .",
    "let us now proceed and study what happens during inflation . in figures [ fig : phi1 ] and [ fig : phi2 ] we have displayed the expectation values of @xmath292 and @xmath287 , the only two fields entering the khler metric of the inflaton , as a function of @xmath267 for two different values of @xmath0 .     for @xmath308 , @xmath307 , and the flux choice .",

    "[ fig : phi2 ] ]    apparently , decreasing @xmath0 ( and thus increasing the mass hierarchy ) weakens the dependence of @xmath292 and @xmath287 on @xmath267 .",
    "after what we learned from our toy model in section [ sec : toyflat ] , this is no surprise : as in that model  and also in our study of the backreaction of @xmath87 , increasing the mass hierarchy reduces the field displacements of the rest of the moduli during inflation .    finally , let us consider what happens to the effective field range @xmath309 the important plot is given in figure [ yes ] , for four different values of @xmath0 .",
    ", for four different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the logarithmic regime for large values of @xmath148 is evident in the red and green curves .",
    "this is the regime found in @xcite . but",
    "evidently , for a large hierarchy between @xmath0 and the remaining flux quanta , the beginning of the logarithmic regime is pushed to very large field values so that the backreaction is negligible .",
    "[ yes ] ]    again , the result is quite interesting : for large values of @xmath0 , as on the red and green curves , we clearly see the reduced value of @xmath148 for large @xmath267 . as in section",
    "[ sec : toyflat ] and in @xcite , the @xmath267-dependence of the canonical field distance is logarithmic for large field values .",
    "therefore the backreaction from the closed - string moduli on the field metric of the inflaton makes it difficult to get parametrically large displacements .",
    "however , we can push out the canonical critical field value where the logarithmic behavior becomes relevant by decreasing @xmath0 relative to the other flux parameters .",
    "this is possible because , unlike in @xcite , the closed - string expectation values @xmath290 and @xmath310 do not scale with the fluxes in the same way as the critical value @xmath311 .",
    "therefore , as long as a tuning of the different flux parameters is possible , the dangerous effect observed in @xcite can be made irrelevant during inflation .    with regard to inflation ,",
    "notice that the tuning to reach @xmath312 in the nearly - linear regime in figure [ yes ] is @xmath313 , same as the tuning in the khler sector in section [ sec : kms ] .",
    "in fact , the tuning is not just of the same order of magnitude , it is the same tuning : choosing all flux quanta large compared to @xmath0 leads to a large value of @xmath314 compared to @xmath0 . in kklt and related mechanisms , this is exactly what is needed to make @xmath87 heavy compared to the inflaton .    finally , one could think of repeating the analysis of the cosmological observables performed in section [ sec : dbicmb ] after including the correction to the kinetic term coming from backreaction of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in higgs - otic inflation .",
    "however , as long as the aforementioned flux tuning is possible , this correction to the kinetic term is negligible compared to the dbi correction studied in section [ sec : dbicmb ] , so the numerical results found there do not substantially change .",
    "this leads to an interesting alternative to suppress the backreaction in the khler metric .",
    "the @xmath64 corrections from the dbi action lead to a nontrivial kinetic term of the form , which essentially adds an extra term proportional to the dbi scalar potential in the inflaton khler metric .",
    "the resulting effective field range depends on the balance between the dbi correction and the back - reacted saxion expectation values . at the very least ,",
    "the dbi correction will always help to delay the suppression of the canonical distance and disconnect it from the planck scale .",
    "the results presented in sections @xmath315@xmath316 deserve a careful evaluation .",
    "let us discuss a few aspects in detail :    * * flux tuning * + we have confirmed previous results stating that , in order to guarantee moduli stability during inflation , there needs to be a hierarchy of masses between the inflaton field and all moduli .",
    "this applies to the stability of khler moduli , as discussed in section [ sec : kms ] , as well as to complex structure moduli , as studied in section [ sec : cs ] . in the latter",
    "we have also checked that this mass hierarchy is enough to suppress the backreaction on the field - space metric and the canonical field distance . in our particular model of higgs - otic inflation",
    ", this hierarchy must be achieved by a tuning of fluxes : in one case we tune @xmath0 small compared to @xmath123 , in the other case we tune @xmath0 small compared to all other flux parameters entering the gukov - vafa - witten superpotential . therefore ,",
    "in both cases one may ask how @xmath0 can be a number as small as @xmath304 or @xmath317 . +",
    "as is well known , fluxes are determined by integrals of @xmath3-form gauge fields over internal @xmath3-cycles and , therefore , must obey a dirac quantization condition , i.e. , @xmath318 with @xmath319 . here",
    "@xmath320 is the charge of the corresponding object electrically charged under the gauge field .",
    "this implies that all flux quanta @xmath276 , @xmath321 , @xmath279 , @xmath277 , and @xmath278 are indeed integers . if @xmath0 is also a flux quantum , a value of @xmath304 is not allowed .",
    "however , the @xmath0-term for the open - string modulus in the superpotential can receive contributions from different sources and fluxes in the compactification . by requiring some fine - tuning between the different contributions one can obtain smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is analogous to the rationale behind the kklt mechanism and the fine - tuning arguments to obtain a small value of @xmath123 , cf .  the discussions in @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of a tilted d7-brane in a toroidal compactification , the position modulus feels the presence of ns flux in the two two - tori that are only partially wrapped by the brane . another possibility is to consider compactifications beyond toroidal models , with a large number of three - cycles leading to many contributions to the @xmath0-term .",
    "from the perspective of the brane worldvolume action , the brane is only sensitive to the local background and the flux densities around the brane .",
    "these are a combination of many different internal fluxes as well as distant sources back - reacting on the local background .",
    "therefore , a priori there is no restriction to a small value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , increasing the number of three - cycles implies a larger number of complex structure moduli . even if this does not change the results in section [ sec : kms ] , it might make the analysis in section [ sec : cs ] intractable .",
    "nevertheless , the leading source of mass terms for the complex structure moduli can  as in our example above  come from a set of fluxes which do not affect the d7 position moduli and thus do not contribute to the @xmath0-term .",
    "then the expectation values of the complex structure moduli are still approximately independent of the value of @xmath0 . in that case",
    ", we expect the conclusions of section [ sec : cs ] to be qualitatively unchanged in more complicated models .",
    "+ another possibility would be not to decrease @xmath0 , but to increase the value of the other fluxes .",
    "not the absolute values but the ratios to @xmath0 are what matters in suppressing the backreaction . however , large fluxes are problematic for several reasons",
    ". they can easily lead to moduli masses heavier than the kk scale and , furthermore , yield a big rr tadpole which has to be cancelled by a large number of sources with negative d3-brane charge .",
    "the backreaction of these fluxes and additional sources in the global compactification might force us to work beyond the validity of our effective theory .",
    "* * magnitude of the flux superpotential * + there is another question closely related to the previous issue : can the benchmark models we have presented in sections [ sec : kms ] and [ sec : cs ] be made compatible ?",
    "+ the answer seems to be nontrivial , since our example in section [ sec : cs ] implies  mostly independent of the value of @xmath0a large expectation value of the flux superpotential , @xmath322 , on the other hand , requires @xmath123 to be small compared to @xmath323 .",
    "there are two ways out of this predicament .",
    "first , in a more complicated compactification with more flux parameters , @xmath123 may be small even though all flux parameters are integer .",
    "this is very similar to the way @xmath0 can be made small , as discussed above .",
    "thus , there may be a scenario in which both @xmath140 and @xmath324 while the mass hierarchy between inflaton and complex structure moduli is unchanged . in this case",
    "@xmath87 can be stabilized by the kklt mechanism as in section [ sec : kms ] , and the inflaton potential @xmath325 may have the correct normalization .",
    "+ second , even if @xmath123 is @xmath303 , there are viable mechanism for khler moduli stabilization available .",
    "both the large volume scenario @xcite and khler uplifting @xcite do not require a tuning of @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , for both mechanisms the interaction with open - string large - field inflation has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the results are very similar to the kklt scenario : inflation is mostly driven by an inflaton mass term proportional to @xmath326 , and @xmath164 is required to guarantee stability of all khler moduli in the inflationary phase .",
    "also in this case there is a certain range of parameter examples that lead to 60 @xmath2-folds of slow - roll inflation in accordance with cmb observations .",
    "+ thus , the two tunings in section [ sec : kms ] and [ sec : cs ] are indeed compatible , so that all moduli can be stabilized during higgs - otic inflation . *",
    "* constraints on the canonical field space * + let us discuss another issue related to the findings of section [ sec : cs ] : why is higgs - otic inflation a counterexample to the restriction of the canonical field space found in @xcite ? as explained in the very beginning of section [ sec : cs ] , the problems in @xcite are not only related to mass hierarchies . as nicely pointing out in that paper , and more recently in @xcite",
    ", even if such a mass hierarchy can be achieved , one also has to check that the post - inflationary vacuum expectation values of some of the moduli entering the khler metric of the inflaton do not scale with this hierarchy as well . in our example",
    "this would correspond to an increase of @xmath290 and @xmath310 as the mass hierarchy is enhanced .",
    "such an increase would then lead to a reduction of the canonical field range due to . in the setups of @xcite ,",
    "this reduction indeed cancels the increase obtained by engineering a mass hierarchy .",
    "therefore the canonical field range before the backreaction becomes strong is flux - independent and can not be larger than the planck scale .",
    "however , as we have demonstrated both in the toy model of section [ sec : toyflat ] and the numerical example of section [ sec : allstab ] , this does not happen in higgs - otic inflation : there are enough parameters to treat the mass hierarchy and the vacuum expectation values of the relevant fields as independent parameters .",
    "+ the reason for this lies in the respective microscopic setups : the ones considered in @xcite feature closed - string moduli only .",
    "the inflaton candidate is then a light linear combination of otherwise heavy axions .",
    "this , in turn , leads to no - go results for large - field inflation similar to those found in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , higgs - otic inflation features a completely independent light degree of freedom : the position modulus of the d7-brane . tuning",
    "the parameter @xmath0 compared to the other flux parameters  which determine the masses and vevs of the closed - string fields  corresponds to a freedom that is not present in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we should remark , though , that the introduction of open - string fields also makes the analysis of the global compactification more difficult , including the effect of all possible backreactions .",
    "still , we find that the canonical field range indeed scales logarithmically with the inflaton field value in the large - field limit .",
    "but the physical critical value at which this logarithmic behaviour becomes relevant is flux - dependent and therefore not necessarily tied to the planck scale .",
    "* * matching the higgs mass * + the results obtained in sections [ sec : kms ] and [ sec : cs ] not only apply to higgs - otic inflation , but to any inflationary model in which the inflaton is identified with a d7-brane position modulus in a similar background .",
    "in fact , in order to keep the discussion as generic as possible , we have only imposed constraints from cosmological data and not from particle physics so far .",
    "therefore , let us discuss now if the results obtained in the previous sections are still compatible with particle physics phenomenology , if we identify the inflaton with the sm higgs boson as in @xcite .",
    "+ in order to keep one mass eigenstate  the sm higgs boson  light at low energies , there must be an almost massless field at the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath327 , below which the supersymmetric spectrum decouples .",
    "this happens when the running of the soft mass parameters from the compactification scale @xmath328 down to @xmath327 gives rise to a zero eigenvalue in the higgs mass matrix , i.e. , @xmath329 at @xmath327 . for a given value of @xmath327",
    "this imposes a constraint on the mass ratio @xmath330 at @xmath328 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , if such a fine - tuned higgs survives , one necessarily gets @xmath331 gev for @xmath332 gev and standard unification conditions @xmath333 at @xmath328 .",
    "the question is whether this constraint on the mass ratio @xmath150 is compatible with the mass hierarchy required to get moduli stability during inflation .",
    "+ specifically , from we can derive the value of @xmath150 in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath123 , a===. the two benchmark points considered in section [ sec : kms ] correspond to @xmath334 with @xmath335 gev and @xmath336 with @xmath337 gev , respectively .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ sec : kms ] , the mass hierarchy required to get moduli stability and suppress the backreaction of @xmath87 implies a value of @xmath150 very close to one .",
    "this , in turn corresponds to an almost massless state already at @xmath328 .",
    "unfortunately , the above values of @xmath150 are too large and very little running is required to make the higgs determinant vanish . therefore , the massless eigenstate will appear close to @xmath338 gev , implying that the higgs boson at @xmath327 is already tachyonic and triggers electroweak symmetry breaking at a too high energy scale .",
    "+ let us remark that we have assumed no additional physics until @xmath327 , and only the mssm spectrum beyond it .",
    "additional states at high energies could modify the renormalization group equations for the soft mass parameters , leading to less stringent constraints on the value of @xmath150 .",
    "furthermore , the above tension arises from the fact that the mass scale for the heavy higgs @xmath5 coincides with the mass scale of the khler modulus , parameterized by @xmath123 .",
    "if one finds a scenario where both scales are decoupled , one could decrease the mass of @xmath5 while maintaining @xmath339 and moduli stability . that , in turn , would lead to a lower value of @xmath150 .",
    "this might be possible , for instance , by placing the system of d7-branes in a strongly warped region of the compactification .",
    "we have studied moduli stabilization and its effects in large - field d7-brane inflation in type iib string theory .",
    "we have focussed on the setup of higgs - otic inflation , in which the position modulus of one or more d7-branes is a monodromic axion with potentially trans - planckian field excursion .",
    "the monodromy is sourced by three - form fluxes in the internal manifold .",
    "the most important conclusion of our work is that , provided a certain tuning of fluxes is possible , large - field inflation and full moduli stabilization can be successfully combined .",
    "we have analyzed the stabilization of khler moduli via non - perturbative physics , and  confirming earlier results in the literature  have shown that stability is guaranteed throughout the expansion history of the universe as long as the mass of the moduli can be tuned larger than the inflationary hubble scale at horizon crossing . in the particular setup at hand",
    "this means that the flux density @xmath0 , responsible for the mass of the inflaton , must be tuned much smaller than the flux superpotential @xmath123 , which determines the mass of the volume modulus . for an appropriate hierarchy between these two scales , in our examples a factor 300 or 400 , integrating out the heavy modulus in its inflaton - dependent minimum leads to a correction of the inflaton potential .",
    "this correction is negative and leads to a flattening of the potential .",
    "this effect has been observed before in the literature , and seems generic in large - field inflation models from string compactifications .",
    "in addition , the inflaton has a nontrivial kinetic term because its dynamics is governed by the dbi action .",
    "we have shown that gaugino condensates responsible for moduli stabilization lead to a coefficient of the kinetic term that is proportional to the leading - order scalar potential , after the backreaction of the volume modulus is taken into account .",
    "this coefficient leads to an additional flattening of the potential . through a matching of the flux parameters in the expanded dbi action with the supergravity data ,",
    "we have numerically obtained the action for the canonically normalized inflaton field . for large field values ,",
    "the shape of the effective potential approximates @xmath340 .",
    "the predictions for 60 @xmath2-folds of slow - roll inflation lie well within the allowed regime of the latest cmb data .",
    "moreover , we have discussed the stabilization and backreaction of complex structure moduli and the dilaton .",
    "we have analyzed scenarios in which both can be stabilized supersymmetrically by additional three - form fluxes .",
    "regarding stability and backreaction of the moduli , the results are quite similar to the khler sector . if the mass hierarchy between the inflaton and the moduli can be made sufficiently large  again @xmath313 in this case  all backreaction effects are negligible .",
    "in particular , this applies to a specific backreaction in the kinetic term which , in scenarios with only closed - string fields , leads to a severe reduction of the canonical field distance traveled during inflation .",
    "as we have demonstrated , in our setup this reduction is negligible during large - field inflation .",
    "the inclusion of open - string fields generically yields more freedom to tune the necessary hierarchies .",
    "we thank david ciupke , aitor landete , fernando marchesano , and eran palti for useful discussions .",
    "this work is partially supported by the grants fpa2012 - 32828 from the mineco , the erc advanced grant sple under contract erc-2012-adg-20120216 - 320421 and the grant sev-2012 - 0249 of the  centro de excelencia severo ochoa \" programme .",

    "we provide here a toroidal type iib orientifold example showing how certain closed - string fluxes not only contribute to the moduli superpotential but also generate @xmath0-terms for charged matter fields . to be concrete ,",
    "consider a toroidal setting @xmath341 with the standard @xmath342 orientifold projection . then consider ns fluxes , _ 3 = -_i=1 ^ 3 a_i_i , [ hfluxb ] which are expanded in the standard basis of three - forms on the torus , following the notation of @xcite .",
    "then the gukov - vafa - witten superpotential yields w = -_i a_isu_i , [ wnsrr ] where @xmath85 is the complex dilaton and @xmath343 are the complex structure moduli of the three tori .",
    "consider now a d7-brane wrapping the first two tori and transverse to the third .",
    "we want to show that the same ns fluxes induce a @xmath0-term for the adjoint position modulus @xmath344 which parameterizes the position of this d7-brane in the transverse torus .    for convenience",
    "we start with the mirror type iia toroidal orientifold with an @xmath345 projection and a d6-brane wrapping , for example , the cycle _ 3 = ( 0,1)_1(0,-1)_2(1,0)_3 , where @xmath346 means that the d6-brane wraps @xmath347-times around the @xmath348 direction and @xmath279 times around @xmath349 . in the iia mirror the ns fluxes above map into geometric fluxes . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider only the flux @xmath350 .",
    "the mirror iia geometric flux is @xmath351 , in the notation of @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the chern - simons coupling on the worldvolume of the d6-brane , _ _",
    "3m_4 c_3ff . in the presence of geometric fluxes @xmath352 or , equivalently , on a twisted torus one replaces f _ ab f_ab + _",
    "ab^ia_i = f_ab + ( .",
    "a)_ab , so that , after putting the legs of @xmath353 in the minkowski direction and integrating by parts , one gets f_4 ^ 0 _ _ 3 ( .a ) a , where @xmath354 is a type iia minkowski four - form .",
    "we thus see that there is a coupling of this four - form to a wilson line bilinear controlled by the background @xmath355 . in particular ,",
    "for the three - cycle above one finds the action a_3",
    "f_4 ^ 0 ( a_3)^2 = a_3 f_4 ^ 0 ( _ 3)^2 , where @xmath356 is a wilson line scalar on the d6-brane . as discussed in @xcite , in type iia @xmath354 couples to the real part of the superpotential , i.e. f_4 ^ 0 ( w ) , so we can identify a contribution to the superpotential ( w_a_3 ) = a_3 ( _ 3)^2 .",
    "holomorphicity allows us to complete the form of the induced superpotential .",
    "along the third torus the d6-brane open - string modulus is a combination of the wilson line @xmath356 and position modulus @xmath357 , which parameterizes the motion in the direction perpendicular to the d6-brane in that complex plane : _",
    "3 = _ 3 + t_3_3 .",
    "hence , the piece of the superpotential proportional to @xmath350 is w_a_3 = a_3 _ 3 ^ 2 , which is a @xmath0-term .",
    "let us check for completeness that the cross term in @xmath358 involving the coupling @xmath359 also appears in the action .",
    "in addition to the above cs coupling , there is a coupling on the twisted torus of the form _ _",
    "3m_4 c_3f _ p , where the subscript @xmath29 indicates the pullback and @xmath53 is the ns two - form .",
    "after partial integration we get a coupling for the above choice of d6-brane , f_4 ^ 0 _ _ 3 a_3 = f_4 ^ 0 a_3 ( _ 3 b_3 _ 3 ) , where @xmath360 and @xmath357 is the position modulus transverse to the d6-brane in the third complex plane .",
    "we observe that the required term is in indeed present .",
    "going back to iib , dualizing along the three horizontal directions of the torus , we end up with a d7-brane which is localized on the third torus and wraps the other two .",
    "the field @xmath344 is now mapped to a complex scalar which parameterizes the position on the third torus .",
    "we conclude that in iib the standard ns flux @xmath350 gives rise not only to a moduli superpotential piece @xmath361 but also to a contribution to the @xmath0-term for the adjoint @xmath344 .",
