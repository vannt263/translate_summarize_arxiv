    "a change in the conductance behavior by molecular adsorption was observed for au , pt , cu , fe , co , and ni nano wires @xcite . here , it should be noted that the conductance can be switched from the off state to the on state or vice versa ( among two states ) in most studies . if the conductance of the nano wires could be controlled among three different conductance states , it would have attracted wide attention for fundamental science and technological applications .    in the present study , we paid attention to the electrochemical potential as an external field @xcite .",
    "the electrochemical potential can control the procession of two individual electrochemical reactions on a metal surface by changing the electrochemical potential of the metal electrode by only several volts .",
    "for example , hydrogen or oxygen evolution proceeds when the electrochemical potential of pt electrodes is maintained at more negative than -0.2 v or more positive than + 1.3 v versus ag / agcl in 0.1 m h@xmath2so@xmath3 solution , respectively @xcite .",

    "if the conductance of the metal nano wire can be defined by the surface condition of the wire , the conductance of the metal nano wire may be controlled by the electrochemical potential .",
    "au was investigated in the present study for the following reasons .",
    "first , the hydrogen and oxygen evolution can proceed without dissolving the au ions from the au electrode ; this is a characteristic of the au electrode in solution . in the case of ni , ni rapidly dissolves at the oxygen evolution potential @xcite .",
    "it is thus difficult to prepare stable ni nano wires under oxygen evolution .",

    "the experiments were performed with the modified scanning tunneling microscope ( stm : pico - spm , molecular imaging co. ) with a nano scopeiiia controller ( digital instruments co. ) in an electrochemical cell ( see ref @xcite for a detailed description of the experimental setup and conditions ) .",
    "the stm tip was made of an au wire ( diameter 0.25 mm , @xmath4 99 @xmath5 ) coated with wax to eliminate ionic conduction .",

    "the 1 @xmath0 plateau could be stretched 0.4 nm in length at the hydrogen evolution potential .",

    "the conductance histogram showed the 0.5 @xmath0 peak , whose intensity could be tuned by the electrochemical potential .",
    "the stability of the au mono atomic contact could be also tuned by the electrochemical potential . as the potential of the au electrodes",
    "was scanned from @xmath6 = 0.5 v to negative , the average length of the last conductance plateau decreased at @xmath6 = -0.2 v , and then reached a minimum value at @xmath6 = -0.4 v in 0.1 m na@xmath2so@xmath3 solution .",

    "the distribution of lengths for the last conductance plateau was investigated at the hydrogen evolution potential .",
    "the same behavior was observed again in the present system .",
    "in addition to previously reported characteristics , several interesting features appeared in the present system . first , the au atomic contact showed the third conductance value ( various conductance values below 1 @xmath0 ) at the oxide formation potential .",
    "second , the au mono atomic contact showed not only 0.5 @xmath0 but also 0.1 @xmath0 in acid solution at the hydrogen evolution potential .",
    "this 0.1 @xmath0 peak was not apparent in the conductance histogram in fig .",
    "6 of reference @xcite , because the intensity of the background around 0.1 @xmath0 was beyond the vertical axis range of the conductance histogram in fig . 6 of reference @xcite .",
    "third , the au atomic contact was stabilized at the oxide formation potential .",
    "fourth , the distribution of lengths for the last conductance plateau was investigated at the double layer and oxide formation potential .",
    "the distribution of lengths was also shown for the 1 @xmath0 plateau , which provided information about the transformation process of the au mono atomic contact during the stretching the contact .",
    "fifth , the distribution of lengths for the conductance plateau was precisely determined by the statistical analysis with a large number of measurements for 10 different samples ( 20000 traces ) . in our previous report , the distribution of lengths for the last conductance plateau was obtained from limited number of conductance traces ( @xmath111000 traces ) for one extraordinarily stable sample at the hydrogen evolution potential @xcite .",
    "although very stable au mono atomic wire occasionally could be fabricated , most of the au atomic contact broke within 0.4 nm in length .",
    "so , the obtained distribution of lengths for the last conductance plateau shifted to the shorter distance compared to the previous result .",
    "the effect of hydrogen and oxygen on the au mono atomic contacts is discussed based on these new findings and improvements .",
    "the conductance behavior of the au mono atomic contact is compared with that in uhv .",
    "the effect of hydrogen and oxygen on the au mono atomic contact was investigated at low temperature in uhv @xcite .",
    "the broad feature appeared below 1 @xmath0 in the conductance histogram of the au contacts after the introduction of hydrogen gas .",
    "the feature below 1 @xmath0 was much smaller than the 1 @xmath0 peak @xcite .",
    "the conductance histogram did not change with the introduction of oxygen gas @xcite . on the other hand , in solution , clear 0.5 @xmath0 and 0.1 @xmath0 peaks appeared in the conductance histogram at the hydrogen evolution potential .",
    "a broad feature appeared below 1 @xmath0 at the oxide formation potential .",
    "these results suggest that a specific structure of the au mono atomic contact with a well - defined fractional conductance value ( 0.5 @xmath0 or 0.1 @xmath0 ) was formed at the hydrogen evolution potential , and various structures in which oxygen strongly interacted with the atomic contact were formed at the oxide formation potential .",
    "the electrochemical potential determines the potential energy of electrons of the metal nano contact , resulting in the control of the bonding strength between the metal atoms , and of the interaction of the metals with molecules in the surrounding medium .",
    "these facts make it possible to use the environment to set the metal contacts , which can not be set in other environments such as in uhv and in air , leading to successful fabrication of very stable metal nano structures showing the conductance quantization which can not be observed in uhv .",
    "the structure of the au mono atomic contact at the hydrogen evolution and oxide formation potential is discussed based on the previously reported experimental result of a flat au surface and theoretical calculation result .",
    "the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction on the flat au electrodes in solution has been investigated by the analysis of current - potential curves @xcite .",
    "when the electrochemical potential of the au electrode is kept positive ( @xmath6 @xmath4 1.6 v ) in acidic solution , oxygen evolution has been proposed to proceed through the following process .",
    "first , hydroxyl ions adsorb onto the au surface forming surface hydroxides ( 1 ) , second , surface hydroxides convert to oxides ( 2 ) , and third , o@xmath2 ( gas ) desorbs from the surface ( 3 )",

    "[ fig1](b ) ) , the main anodic peak above @xmath6= 0.8 v and an increase in the oxidation current above @xmath6= 1.3 v correspond to the oxide formation process ( 2 ) and the o@xmath2 ( gas ) desorption process ( 3 ) .",
    "as for the surface oxide , higher oxide ( au@xmath2o@xmath15 ) or hydroxide ( au(oh)@xmath15 ) was proposed @xcite .",
    "the increase in redox current below @xmath6= -0.7 v corresponds to the h@xmath2 ( gas ) desorption process ( 5 ) .",
    "the surface coverage of hydrogen was estimated to be very small ( @xmath10 0.3 @xmath5)@xcite . here , it should be noticed that the detail reaction mechanism of the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction on the au electrode has not been fully understood up to now .",
    "in addition , the reaction on the au mono atomic contact might not be the same as that on the flat au electrode .",
    "however , the observed conductance behavior and the reaction on the flat metal surface strongly suggested that the oxygen or hydrogen is adsorbed on or incorporated into the au mono atomic contact at the oxide formation and hydrogen evolution potential .",
    "the structure of the au mono atomic contact is discussed with the previously reported theoretical calculation result .",
    "the interaction between the au mono atomic wire and oxygen or hydrogen has been investigated with theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculation results showed that the hydrogen 1s orbital or oxygen 2p orbital effectively hybridized with the au 5d and au 6s orbitals . due to the strong interaction , oxygen and hydrogen molecules dissociated on the au mono atomic wire , and",
    "then were stably incorporated into the au mono atomic wire . in the hydrogen ( oxygen )",
    "incorporated wire , we can expect electron transfer from hydrogen to au ( from au to oxygen ) .",
    "the au wire would be , thus , positively ( negatively ) charged for the hydrogen ( oxygen ) incorporated wire .",
    "because of the formation of hydrogen or oxygen incorporation into the wire , the conductance of the au mono atomic wire decreased to 0.6 - 0.01 @xmath0 , possibly due to scattering or interference of conducting electrons in the wire .",
    "no preferential atomic configurations were found for the hydrogen or oxygen incorporated au mono atomic wire .",
    "jelinek et al .",
    "calculated the conductance of the au mono atomic wire in which a hydrogen atom or an undissociated molecule adsorbed on it @xcite .",
    "the conductance value was calculated to be 0.7 - 0.5 @xmath0 and 1.05 - 0.95 @xmath0 for the au atomic contact in which a hydrogen atom and molecule adsorbed on it , respectively .",
    "the adsorbed atomic hydrogen effectively affected the conductance of the au mono atomic wire , as is the case for the incorporation of hydrogen into the au wire . on the other hand , the conductance value of the au atomic wire with an adsorbed undissociated hydrogen molecule did not change from that of the clean au atomic wire ( 1 @xmath0 ) .",
    "the adsorbed undissociated hydrogen molecule would not affect the conductance of the au mono atomic wire , in contrast with the adsorbed hydrogen atom and incorporated hydrogen .",
    "now , we try to propose the structure model of the au mono atomic contact at the hydrogen evolution and oxide formation potential based on the above discussion . at the oxide formation potential , various conductance values",
    "were observed for the au mono atomic contact ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](c , f ) ) .",
    "this conductance behavior agreed with the calculated conductance behavior of the oxygen incorporated au wire @xcite .",

    "<S> conductance of an au mono atomic contact was investigated under the electrochemical potential control . </S>",
    "<S> the au contact showed three different behaviors depending on the potential : 1 @xmath0 ( @xmath0 = @xmath1 ) , 0.5 @xmath0 and not - well defined values below 1 @xmath0 were shown when the potential of the contact was kept at -0.6 v ( double layer potential ) , -1.0 v ( hydrogen evolution potential ) , and 0.8 v ( oxide formation potential ) versus ag / agcl in 0.1 m na@xmath2so@xmath3 solution , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these three reversible states and their respective conductances could be fully controlled by the electrochemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> these changes in the conductance values are discussed based on the proposed structure models of hydrogen adsorbed and oxygen incorporated on an au mono atomic contact . </S>"
