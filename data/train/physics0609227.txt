    "reversible chemical modifications of proteins are well - known to play a pivotal role in the dynamics of the biochemical networks which allow a cell to convey and translate information from environmental signals to processes such as cell activation , proliferation and death @xcite .",
    "moreover , some important biochemical paths are known to behave as irreversible on - off switches @xcite , and this switch - like character has been associated to the chemical modification dynamics of proteins on multiple aminoacid residues or domains @xcite .",
    "multisite phosphorylation is the foremost example of protein modification because it shows up ubiquitously in many important biochemical paths , but in addition there are several other multisite modification mechanisms , like acetylation , methylation , etc .",
    ", which act at all levels in the biochemical control networks ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . since multisite protein modification ( mpm ) is present in all eukariotes ( yeasts , plants , and animal cells ) , it appears to be an evolutionary conserved mechanism that regulates biochemical thresholds and switching mechanisms .",
    "these considerations indicate that mpm is an essential component of many biochemical networks .",
    "however biochemical networks are complex entities where many processes are intertwined with one another and seem to be unapproachable with analytical tools : for this reason networks that incorporate mpm have been studied numerically in an effort to understand the role of mpm itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we attack the problem from a different standpoint : we assume that mpm steps have a common character and that they behave much like discrete components in an electronic circuit .",
    "therefore we start by studying mpm in isolation : in this way it is possible to understand the role of mpm even without embedding it in a larger network , and we can produce a few analytical results before resorting to numerical methods .    we have already discussed some of the nontrivial features of mpm in @xcite : in the following section we briefly review the model and the concepts introduced in @xcite .",
    "section [ diffeq ] , where we derive the basic set of differential equations , and section [ eqval ] , where we find the equilibrium concentrations , both review previous results and introduce the probabilistic interpretation that we have already used in @xcite .",
    "next we analyze the equations and find the system behavior for small deviations from the equilibrium values in sections [ relax ] and [ eigen ] .",
    "we use the results of section [ eigen ] to synthesize noise spectra in section [ psd ] .",
    "we obtain numerical results on the full nonlinear system in section [ num1 ] and discuss the general validity of the previous results in section [ open ] .",
    "we include a downstream catalyzed michaelis - menten reaction in sections [ switch ] and [ cyclecontrol ] .",
    "we introduce a more realistic phosphorylation / dephosphorylation dynamics in section [ add ] and use it to produce new numerical results in section [ cyclecontrol2 ] . finally we draw our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "here we summarize very briefly the results given in @xcite : in that paper we introduce the reaction scheme shown in figure [ fig1 ] , which is very close to that considered by monod , wyman , and changeux @xcite , where a chemical species @xmath1 can modify a number of sites on protein @xmath2 .",
    "we also assume that the @xmath3 modifications sites are all equivalent and that the modification dynamics for each site is independent from those of the other sites : this means that we consider the states @xmath4 with @xmath5 modified sites ( see , e.g. , the transition chain shown in figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "then , if the single chemical modification dynamics is fast with respect to the observation time we can forget the dynamics of the transition chain and even the chain itself and concentrate instead on the equilibrium probabilities . if the protein becomes activated when the number of modified sites is larger than a threshold value @xmath6 , then from the equilibrium probabilities @xmath7 of the modified states @xmath4 , we show that the concentration of the activated form vs. @xmath1 has a sigmoid behavior with exponential tails , and this defines a very sharp biochemical threshold .",
    "the threshold turns out to be robust , i.e. , it has a reduced sensitivity to parameter changes , which is further reduced as @xmath3 and @xmath6 grow .",
    "moreover , when we couple a downstream michaelis - menten process @xcite we find that mpm can produce large delays , that once again depend on the number of modification sites @xmath3 and on @xmath6 , and can span several orders of magnitude , thereby providing a link between the fast time scale of molecular reactions and the slow pace of cell growth and proliferation .",
    "we are also able to relate the model to the standard hill phenomenology , which acquires a precise meaning in this context . and yet , the approach in @xcite is incomplete because a real treatment of the dynamics is lacking , and to make further progress we must turn to a better dynamical description .",
    "the model from which we start , and which we modify later to introduce an activation threshold , is a classic model in the theory of allosteric activity @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the equations is given , e.g. , in @xcite section 2.4 , and is based on the following simplifying assumptions :    * all sites are equivalent ; * the occupation of a given site is not influenced by the activity of nearby sites ; * the number of modification sites is constant throughout the process ( i.e. , as the protein modification proceeds and possibly changes the protein shape , no new sites are added nor any existing sites are removed ) ; * the behavior of the protein depends only on the total number of occupied sites , so that the state alone @xmath4 actually characterizes the protein activity ; * we assume that the probability of multiple modification events is negligible , and therefore we consider only transitions to neighboring states ( i.e. , there are no transitions from @xmath4 to @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) . * the on - off rates @xmath10 and @xmath11 remain fixed and do not depend on modification - induced changes .    from these assumptions",

    "we wish to stress that the nonlinear dynamical system described in this section is still highly idealized , it is chemically closed and in thermal equilibrium , and is not actually useful until it is coupled with the cellular environment : we accomplish this in section [ switch ] , where we relax condition ( [ bcons ] ) ( for a discussion of the features of closed and open biochemical systems see , e.g. , the introduction of the review paper @xcite ) .",
    "as we mentioned above , the differential system ( [ gensys ] ) is in the textbooks , and the equilibrium solution is well - known @xcite : in this section we review the basic results and recast the equilibrium solution in a suitable form .",
    "we introduce the auxiliary variables @xmath17/[a]_0 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19/[a]_0 $ ] , and the reduced parameter @xmath20_0 $ ] , so that @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath7 s can be reinterpreted as the probabilities of finding a protein molecule with @xmath5 modified sites : with this probabilistic interpretation the differential system becomes the master equation for the @xmath7 s .",
    "we also introduce the corresponding barred quantities @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which denote the equilibrium values , and if we assume in addition that the underlying stochastic process ( the chain of individual modification events ) is ergodic , then in the long - time limit these probabilities also give the fraction of residence time in each modified state .",
    "if the system is taken at equilibrium then the derivatives vanish and the differential system reduces to a set of algebraic equations .",
    "the solution of the system is @xcite : @xmath25 here @xmath23 is still undefined , and we need yet another equation : we take the conservation equation ( [ bcons ] ) , which can be rewritten as @xmath26 where @xmath27_0/[a]_0 $ ] , then , substituting the solution ( [ gensol ] ) in ( [ gencons ] ) it is easy to show the new conservation condition @xmath28 and then we find a quadratic equation from which we get eventually the equilibrium concentration @xmath29\\ ] ] ( the solution with the minus sign before the square root is unacceptable because it gives a negative concentration ) . the value ( [ genb ] ) can be translated back to the usual notation so that the equilibrium concentration writes @xmath30_{eq } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( -\\left\\{n[a]_0+(k_-/k_+)-[b]_0\\right\\ } \\right.\\\\ \\label{genb2 } & & \\left.+ \\sqrt{\\left\\{n[a]_0+(k_-/k_+)-[b]_0\\right\\}^2 + 4(k_-/k_+)[b]_0 } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the @xmath23 value that is necessary to evaluate the @xmath31 s is just @xmath32_{eq}$ ] .    at this point",
    "it is also interesting to notice that a directly observable quantity , the average occupation level , can be associated to the equilibrium values in a direct way : @xmath33_{0}-[b]_{eq}}{[a]_0}\\ ] ] a straightforward calculation also yields the variance of the fluctuations close to equilibrium @xmath34    the equilibrium values @xmath35_{eq}$ ] and @xmath16_{eq}$ ] depend on the total concentrations @xmath13_0 $ ] , @xmath16_0 $ ] , and on the on - off ratio @xmath36 .",
    "whenever @xmath37 is large , the equilibrium concentration ( [ genb2 ] ) can be approximated as follows @xmath38_{eq}\\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left [    |n[a]_0-[b]_0| -\\left(n[a]_0-[b]_0\\right ) \\right]\\ ] ] and we see that there is a breakpoint at @xmath16_0=n[a]_0 $ ] , which is the threshold of saturation .",

    "we note that for large values of @xmath36 , i.e. in the case in which the detachment reaction is negligible with respect to site modification , the curves are more kinky and change sharply after reaching the saturation threshold .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the modification level @xmath44 and the standard deviation @xmath45 .",
    "notice that @xmath44 grows nearly linearly until the saturation value is reached , at @xmath16_0=n[a]_0=0.16 $ ] mm , and that the standard deviation is usually much smaller than the average modification level .",
    "similarly , figure [ fig6 ] shows the average number of modified sites in the @xmath4 s that are above threshold , i.e. , @xmath46 , and the corresponding standard deviation @xmath47 of the number of sites above threshold : the standard deviation @xmath47 is the largest in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "we have already noted in section [ diffeq ] that the system is closed , and therefore  even though the equations are nonlinear  we can state on very general grounds that it must be stable as well @xcite . in the previous section",
    "we have examined the equilibrium values , but in all possible biological settings it is very important to consider the dynamical behavior of the concentrations @xmath35 $ ] and of the modification level @xmath44 as well , and we turn again to the original differential system ( [ gensys ] ) , which we rewrite here using the reduced variables : @xmath48 where we wish to stress that , in addition to the @xmath35 $ ] s , also @xmath16 $ ] and therefore also @xmath49 are time - dependent quantities . if we introduce the deviations from the equilibrium values @xmath50 and recall that @xmath51 , we can linearize the system ( [ gensys2 ] ) for small deviations : @xmath52 + \\delta p_1\\right\\ } \\\\",

    "we have seen earlier that the conservation equation ( [ consa ] ) , which translates into the normalization condition for the probabilities @xmath7 , is automatically satisfied by the differential system ( [ gensys ] ) , and it can be readily verified that the linearized system ( [ linsys ] ) preserves this condition : this produces the 0 eigenvalue .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows plots of the the eigenvalues vs. @xmath16_0 $ ] for the example discussed in section [ eqval ] ( i.e. with @xmath70 ) : apart from the even spacing of the eigenvalues @xmath71 to @xmath72 , one important feature of this plot is the cross - over behavior of the @xmath73 eigenvalue . using the equilibrium concentration @xmath24 given by equation ( [ genb ] ) and the cross - over condition @xmath74 , after some straightforward algebra one finds the cross - over concentration @xmath75 which approximates to @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath16_0 \\approx n [ a]_0 $ ] for @xmath77 ( i.e. , in this case the cross - over value corresponds to the saturation threshold ) . notice also that for fixed concentrations of a and b , and fixed on - off ratio @xmath36 , the system moves to higher frequencies ( shorter reaction times ) as @xmath3 grows , i.e. , fluctuations are more effectively damped - off for higher @xmath3 s .",
    "biochemical reactions where only few molecules are involved are affected by molecular noise : this noise often has a deep biochemical meaning @xcite , and is most often studied by monte carlo simulation @xcite . however , when the eigenvalues of the linearized system are known , as in the present case , it is possible to synthesize directly the noise spectra @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues determine the spectral density of the occupation level of the molecular population : because of the random ( poisson ) character of the individual molecular events the spectral density of the concentrations in the dynamical system , and in particular the spectral density @xmath78 of the modification level @xmath5 , can be derived from the incoherent superposition of the spectral densities of the individual relaxation processes associated to each eigenvalue @xcite @xmath79    we point out that the noise spectrum of the fluctuating modification level has a characteristic shape that depends on the concentration of @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution for the example discussed at the end of section [ eqval ] and shown in figure [ fig7 ] indicates that at low concentration @xmath16 $ ] the spectral density is roughly the superposition of two simple relaxation processes , then close to the threshold the spectral density collapses to a simple relaxation process ( and thus is characterized by a @xmath80 power - law region ) . finally , above threshold",
    "the spectral density has low - frequency white noise region , an intermediate @xmath81 region , and a @xmath80 high - frequency behavior .",
    "the @xmath81 power - law behavior is limited to the range determined by the minimum frequency @xmath82 and the maximum frequency @xmath83 .",

    "figure [ fig8 ] shows that the spectra for the example in section [ eqval ] have a low - frequency white noise plateau and a high - frequency @xmath80 noise tail , however when @xmath16_0 \\ge n [ a]_0 $ ] there is also a small @xmath81 noise region which spans approximately one frequency decade just as discussed above .",
    "however , although the slope change is clear , the @xmath81 region is not well defined because of the closeness of the extreme eigenvalues @xmath71 and @xmath73 .",
    "the full differential system ( [ gensys ] ) may be solved numerically with standard integration methods : we remark that the ( asymptotic ) stability properties are the same as those of the linearized system , and are guaranteed in our case by a theorem due to poincar and perron ( see , e.g. @xcite , pp .",
    "161 - 163 ) , and therefore we do no expect to find any remarkably new features in the numerical solutions .",

    "it is natural to wonder if the eigenvalues can also be useful to understand msm when the biochemical system is open .",
