    "since the pb theory is a mean - field approximation , it does not take into account neither the correlations between the charges , nor does it allow for fluctuations around the mean - field solution , and over the years several alternatives and extensions of this theory have been proposed .",
    "they include significant corrections in cases of multivalent ions and high charge density , especially near surfaces and membranes , and the effects of correlations and fluctuations @xcite .",
    "for very high ionic densities , steric effects prevent ions from accumulating near charged surfaces , and lead to a modified pb ( mpb ) equation @xcite .",

    "more recently , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been used to study the behavior of aqueous solutions , allowing the study of very specific models for solvent and solute molecules  @xcite .",

    "the hydration shell is created by the interactions between the molecules of the dielectric medium ( water ) and the ions .",
    "the strong electric field around each ion is greater than the external electric field , and re - orients the dipoles in its vicinity .",
    "the total response of dipoles to the external field is thus smaller and leads to a reduction in the dielectric constant",
    ".    both of these mechanisms , at least for dilute solutions , are linear in the ionic concentration .",
    "as long as the hydration shell radius is smaller than the distance between neighboring ions , each ion contributes for the decrement of the total dielectric constant independently of the other ions .",

    "three major modifications of the pb theory are considered : first we relax the assumption of the continuous water dielectric medium and consider instead a microscopic model of dipoles .",
    "second , we take into account fluctuations and correlations between dipoles and ions via a field - theoretical loop expansion .",
