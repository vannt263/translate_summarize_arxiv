    "as an interesting subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) were initially defined with the following optical spectral characteristics : h@xmath1 full width half maximum ( fwhm ) less than @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 ; strong optical fe ii multiplets ; a line - intensity ratio of [ o  iii]@xmath05007 to h@xmath1 less than 3 , which distinguishes between seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich 1998 ) . a steep , soft x - ray excess ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ; boller et al . 1996 ) and rapid soft / hard x - ray variability ( leighly 1999 ; cheng et al .",
    "2002 ) are shown in the x - ray observations of nls1s .",
    "the popular model of nls1s is that they contain less massive black holes with higher eddington ratios ( pounds et al .",
    "1995 ; wandel & boller ( 1998 ) ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ; mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ) , suggesting that nls1s might be in the early stage of agn evolution ( grupe 1996 ; mathur 2000 ; bian & zhao 2003 ) .    based on the standard model of agns ,",
    "the characteristic emission lines are emitted from the so - called broad line region ( blr ) and the narrow line region ( nlr ) ( see sulentic et al .",
    "2000 for a review of the blr ) .",
    "the reverberation mapping technique shows that the kinematics of the emitting gas in the blr are determined by the gravitational potential of the central supermassive black hole ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "the correlation between the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( derived from ca ii absorption and [ o iii ] emission ) suggests that the nlr kinematics are determined , in large part , by the bulge potential ( nelson & white 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the fwhm of the [ o iii ] line may be adopted as a surrogate of the bulge stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "recently , using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , we find that nls1s as a class deviate from the @xmath4 relation seen in normal galaxies .",
    "this is confirmed by other investigations with rosat data , and it is suggested that the black holes with higher eddington ratios in some nls1s are still growing ( grupe & mathur 2004 ; mathur & grupe 2005 ) . although boroson ( 2003 ) suggested that for agns the stellar velocity dispersions measured by [ o iii ] can predict the black hole mass to a factor of five , it is possible that the [ o iii ] width is not a good tracer of the velocity dispersion for nls1s .",
    "botte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that the [ o iii ] linewidth indeed typically overestimates the stellar velocity dispersion compared to the direct measure of the ca ii absorption triplet .",
    "these results support that the dynamics of the nlr in nls1s would be different than that of other agns .",
    "outflows have been reported in some nls1s .",
    "a very significant blueshift of about @xmath5 for the [ o iii ] line relative to the rest - frame defined by the h@xmath1 line is found in the prototype nls1 i zw 1 ( boroson & oke 1987 ) .",

    "the spectra are transformed into the rest frame defined by the redshift given in their fits header . because of the asymmetry of the profiles of [ o iii ] and/or h@xmath1 lines , we used two - component models to fit the emission lines of h@xmath1 and [ o iii ] @xmath94959 , 5007 , employing the iraf task specfit ( kriss 1994 ) for a careful look at the [ o iii ] blueshift phenomenon ( e.g. zheng et al .",
