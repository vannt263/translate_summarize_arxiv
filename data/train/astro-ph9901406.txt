    "the presence of hot , x - ray  emitting gas in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential well of a cluster of galaxies provides a powerful tool for measuring the amount and distribution of the total mass of the cluster ( e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) . once the mass of the galaxies that compose the cluster and the mass of the hot gas is subtracted from the total mass , the amount of dark matter contained within the cluster can be determined .",
    "knowledge of the amount and distribution of dark matter within clusters is crucial for distinguishing among competing cosmological models , that predict a high baryon fraction for a low density universe , and vice versa ( e.g. , white et al .  1993 ) .",
    "the total gravitational mass contained within radius @xmath1 is determined through the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath2 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the density gradient of the hot gas , @xmath3 , temperature of the gas @xmath4 , and temperature gradient of the gas , @xmath5 , need to be measured from x - ray observations .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the mass results from @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in most previous approaches , an integrated temperature with no radial gradient was assumed .",
    "earlier x - ray telescopes such as _ ginga _ and _ exosat _ could determine a global temperature , but lacked the spatial resolution needed to determine the temperature gradient .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "pspc possessed good ( 25@xmath6 ) spatial resolution , but was not sensitive to photon energies above 2.4 kev , making good estimates of the temperatures of hot ( @xmath7 kev ) clusters difficult to acquire .",
    "_ asca _ is sensitive to photon energies up to 10 kev , but the large energy - dependent point spread function ( psf ) of _ asca _ makes it very difficult to obtain spectra within concentric annular bins that are not significantly contaminated by photons scattered into the bin from another bin .",
    "the average half - power diameter of the _ asca _ psf is @xmath8 , and the width of the psf increases with increasing energy ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "thus , higher energy photons originating on - axis are more efficiently scattered to large off - axis angular distances than lower energy photons .",
    "this has the effect of introducing a spurious temperature increase to an isothermal profile .",
    "for example , an isothermal profile with a temperature of 7 kev will appear to increase to a temperature of 18 kev at an angular distance of @xmath9 ( takahashi et al .",
    "1995 ) due to the widening of the psf at higher energies .",
    "still , in principle it is possible to account for the psf and derive accurate temperature profiles for clusters .",
    "radial temperature profiles for many clusters observed with _",
    "asca _ have been published in the literature that are reported to have been corrected for the energy - dependent psf ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter m98 ; markevitch 1996 ; ikebe 1995 ) however , in some cases where the same data have been analyzed by different authors , significantly different results have been found .",
    "it is important to determine which psf - correction method is correct , since a nearly complete flux - limited sample of nearby clusters has already been observed with _",
    "asca _ , and it is unlikely that this will be repeated with _",
    "axaf _ in the near future .",
    "even though _ axaf _ has the required spatial resolution and wide energy bandpass to determine the radial temperature gradient within clusters , the rather small field of view of _ axaf _ is insufficient to image nearby clusters out to large angular distances ( @xmath10 ) without resorting to the time - consuming process of observing the cluster with several different pointings .    in this paper , we summarize all _ asca_-derived cluster temperature profiles found in the literature , and use archival _ rosat _ pspc data to attempt to determine whether temperature gradients exist in the hot gas contained within clusters of galaxies . rather than perform detailed spectral fitting to the _ rosat _ pspc data ,",
    "we calculate three x - ray",
    " colors \" ( ratios of counts in bands covering the _ rosat _ bandpass ) in an effort to detect a hardening or softening of the spectra as a function of radius .",
    "this method has the advantage of being non - parametric , and is suitable for detecting changes in temperature , as opposed to the actual temperature values .",
    "a technique similar to this has been used to search for cooling gas and excess absorption in the centers of cooling flow clusters observed by _",
    "rosat _ by allen & fabian ( 1997 ) .",
    "these authors find that their color profiles suggest isothermality outside of the cooling flow region , although their profiles typically extend out to only @xmath11 .",
    "our goal is to extend this result out to @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , this type of colors technique has also been used recently by ettori , fabian , & white ( 1998 ) to search for temperature and absorption variations in the perseus cluster .",
    "all clusters we could find in the literature observed with _ asca _ with regular , symmetric x - ray emission for which psf - corrected temperature profiles have been determined to date , and for which a description of the psf - correction method has been outlined are listed in table  [ tab : asca ] .",
    "we have excluded temperature profiles of clusters with asymmetric x - ray emission , for which a radial profile is not useful , and also clusters for which the psf was not accounted for in the analysis ( except for a few low temperature clusters and a2218 ; see below ) . for each cluster",

    "two such clusters are the non - cooling flow cluster pair a399 and a401 .",

    "next , the data were corrected for particle and solar x - ray background , exposure , and vignetting as described by snowden ( 1995 ) .",
    "periods of high background due to charged particles were removed by filtering the data such that all time intervals with a master veto rate above 170 counts s@xmath23 were excluded . since some of the clusters lie in directions of high galactic hydrogen column densities , we excluded data in snowden ( 1995 ) bands r1 , r2 , and r3 ( approximately 0.110.51 kev ) since these bands often have very low x - ray count rates due to absorption .",
    "we created three energy bands with the remaining four energy bands created by the snowden ( 1995 ) routines : r4 + r5 ( approximately 0.520.90 kev ) , r6 ( approximately 0.911.31 kev ) , and r7 ( approximately 1.322.01 kev ) .",
    "nearly all the data were taken in the post - gain change mode ( 1991 october 11 ) with the pspc - b , although a few clusters were observed before the gain change , and two with the pspc - c .",
    "for each of the three energy bands , counts were extracted from 34 concentric annuli centered on the centroid of the x - ray emission . the outer radius of the central bin was usually chosen to be @xmath26 to encompass all or nearly all emission from a cooling flow that might be present . when a cooling flow was not present , the innermost bin often was made larger . in many cases ,",
    "the extraction regions were chosen to match those of previous studies that analyzed _ asca _ data .",
    "unrelated x - ray sources in the field of view were removed from the data . for each band , background counts were obtained from an annulus @xmath27 in extent , and subtracted from the source counts . with a few exceptions ,",
    "the annular rings covered the full azimuthal range .",
    "the exceptions are a85 , a2256 , and a2319 , which show some asymmetry possibly due to a merger . the asymmetric portion of their x - ray emission was not analyzed .    from these three bands",

    "similarly , a2142 was observed with both pspc - b and pspc - c , so the data from each instrument were analyzed separately .",
    "as noted in   [ sec : intro ] , the limited ( @xmath31 kev ) bandpass of the _ rosat _ pspc does not allow tight constraints to be placed on the temperature of hot clusters .",
    "there are conflicting views concerning the reliability of the _ rosat _ pspc to determine accurate global values for hot clusters because of calibration uncertainties of the instrument .",
    "markevitch & vikhlinin ( 1997 ) found that _",
    "rosat _ gave global temperatures for the clusters a3558 and awm7 that were 1.21.75 times lower than the temperatures found by _",
    "asca _ and other high - energy instruments . on the other hand , henry ( 1998 )",
    "has updated table  1 of henry & briel ( 1996 ) and found that the _ rosat_-derived temperatures of seven of nine clusters agreed with the temperatures found by _ asca _ or _ exosat _ within the 1@xmath32 errors . in six of the nine cases ,",
    "the _ rosat _ temperature was less than the temperature derived by other instruments .",
    "we choose to avoid the issue of whether the pspc can accurately determine the temperature of hot clusters , and employ the use of x - ray colors rather than detailed spectral fitting to search for temperature gradients .",
    "we are not concerned with the actual value of the temperature , just changes in the temperature , which should not be affected by calibration uncertainties , unless these uncertainties change as a function of position on the detector .",
    "6.30truein 0.3truein    first , we address the issue as to whether a change in temperature with radius in the 210 kev range would be detectable with _",
    "rosat_. to do this , we have calculated the colors expected from a variety of raymond - smith ( 1977 ) models , once the spectral models have been folded through the spectral response of the pspc using xspec . for these models ,",
    "we have assumed metallicities of 20% , 40% , and 60% and an absorbing hydrogen column density of @xmath33 @xmath24 , although variations in absorption will be discussed below .",
    "the predicted colors c76 , c745 , and c645 are shown for temperatures ranging from 2 kev to 10 kev in figure  [ fig : model_temps ] .",
    "these plots show the color values for low gain data .",
    "model colors for pspc - b high gain and pspc - c data differed by several percent from colors derived from pspc - b low gain data , but were qualitatively very similar as far as their dependence on temperature and metallicity .",
    "the colors c76 and c745 are sensitive to changes in temperature .",
    "for c76 the percentage decrease in going from 10 kev to 5 kev , from 6 kev to 3 kev , and from 4 kev to 2 kev is 7.0% , 10.7% , and 14.7% , respectively , for models with 40% metallicity .",
    "for c745 the percentage decreases were 7.9% , 10.2% , and 12.1% , respectively , for models with 40% metallicity .",
    "the effect of abundance variation on c76 and c745 is negligible above 6 kev and minimal even at 3 kev .",
    "therefore , these two colors appear to be a good indicator of large ( factor of 2 ) changes in the temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the color c645 is insensitive to changes in temperature . at 40% metallicity",
    ", c645 is completely independent of temperature above 3 kev , and is only minimally affected by temperature above 6 kev at 20% and 60% metallicities .",
    "the change in c645 in going from 6 kev to 3 kev is only 2.6% and 3.1% for 20% and 60% metallicities , respectively .",
    "since c645 is not sensitive to temperature ( above 3 kev ) , this color is a useful test of our contaminant removal and background subtraction procedures , as well as an indicator of absorption gradients , if present .",
    "figure  [ fig : absorption ] shows the effect a change in absorption has on the colors at three different temperatures . for all three colors , the percentage change between two temperature tracks is independent of the absorbing column density .",
    "thus , a change in temperature from 10 kev to 5 kev ( for example ) will lead to the same percentage decrease in c76 for a cluster with an absorbing column density of @xmath34 @xmath24 as a cluster with an absorbing column density of @xmath35 @xmath24 .",

    "the nearly constant c745 profile indicates a constant temperature profile , apparently unaffected by the cluster s small cooling flow ( @xmath66 yr@xmath23 ) .",
    "individually , the lack of a simultaneous decrease in the c76 and c745 profiles ( the colors sensitive to changes in temperature ) suggests that the radial temperature profile is nearly constant for most clusters , at least outside the cooling region .",
    "however , in many cases the statistics are not good enough to definitively rule out a temperature gradient . in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty ,",
    "we have calculated color profiles for our sample as a whole . for each cluster , counts were extracted from three concentric annular bins .",
    "the size of the bins were chosen to be the same fraction of the virial radius for each cluster , in order to compare physically similar regions of each cluster regardless of size or distance .",
    "the outer radii of each bin were chosen to be 7.9% , 15.8% , and 35.5% of the virial radius .",
    "this choice of bin size was selected so that the extraction region extended to at least @xmath67 ( to contain all or nearly all cooling flow emission ; only two clusters had innermost annuli of less than 2@xmath25 in extent ) and the outermost bin to no larger than 18@xmath25 ( to stay within the rib support structure ) for all clusters .",

    ", the color profiles were normalized by the global value for that color ( i.e. , c76@xmath69/@xmath70c76@xmath71 , c745@xmath69/@xmath70c745@xmath71 , c645@xmath69/@xmath70c645@xmath71 ) , so that the color profiles for each cluster varied around a value of one . the color profiles were averaged together , with each cluster given equal weights .",
    "the clusters were also averaged by weighting each cluster according to the number of counts that cluster contributed to the sum total of counts ( calculated separately for each spatial bin ) .",
    "the two procedures yielded results that agreed to within 1% for each spatial and color bin , and was less than 0.5% for a majority of bins .",
    "since the equal weighting average yielded somewhat higher errors ( given by the uncertainty in the mean for the cluster sample ) , we adopt the equal weighting scheme to be conservative .",
    "the composite color profiles for all clusters in the sample is shown in figure  [ fig : composite_all ] . for display purposes ,",
    "we have multiplied the c745 profile ( dotted line ) by a factor of 1.1 and the c645 profile ( dashed line ) by 1.2 .",
    "the outer two bins for both c76 and c745 show remarkable agreement , and the errors are 1% or less ( given by the uncertainty of the mean of the sample ) .",
    "since these two colors are sensitive to changes in temperature , this strongly suggests isothermality in the outer regions of clusters , at least out to 35% of the virial radius . at 10 kev",
    "( 5 kev ) , a drop in temperature from bin 2 to bin 3 of 20% ( 12% ) is ruled out at the 99% confidence level .",
    "the innermost bin of these two profiles is noticeably lower than the other bins , suggesting a temperature drop in the center .",
    "this is to be expected considering that the innermost bin is similar in size to the cooling radius of clusters that possess cooling flows .",
    "this drop is not seen in the inner bin of the composite c645 profile , since c645 is insensitive to changes in temperature . however , this color is sensitive to absorption and metallicity gradients , both of which are expected ( if present ) to lead to a softening of the profile with increasing radius for physically realistic situations .",
    "6.30truein 0.3truein    the main purpose for calculating the temperature - insensitive c645 profiles was to have an indicator as to whether some unknown systematic effect was biasing our results by introducing a spurious gradient to the color profiles .",
    "as shown above , this color profile should be flat ( neglecting metallicity effects ) , so any radially - dependent systematic effect that might be biasing the temperature - sensitive c76 and c745 colors should be easily detectable in c645 . to test this ,",
    "we have calculated the significance of the deviations of the c645(@xmath1 ) values from the global c645 value for each cluster for each spatial bin in the sample , i.e. , ( c645@xmath72c645@xmath73)/(error in c645@xmath74(@xmath1 ) ) , for each cluster @xmath75 .",

    "the mean and standard deviation of the distribution are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "6.30truein 0.3truein    the agreement in the outer two bins of the composite c76 and c745 profiles is not the result of averaging together rapidly increasing profiles with rapidly decreasing individual color profiles .",
    "the same statistical test used to determine the robustness of the constancy of c645 was used on the outer two spatial bins of c76 and c745 for each cluster ( we have omitted the inner cooling flow spatial bin , and determined the global color using only the outer two spatial bins ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "again , the histogram is gaussian , with a mean of @xmath78 and a dispersion of @xmath79 .",
    "obviously , if we were merging together strongly increasing and strongly decreasing individual color profiles , the width of the gaussian would be much more than unity .",
    "next , we separated the sample into two groups according to whether the cluster possessed a substantial cooling flow ( @xmath80 yr@xmath23 ) or not to verify that the drop in c76 and c745 in the innermost bin was due to cooling gas at lower temperatures .",
    "the color profiles for the cooling flow subsample are shown in figure  [ fig : composite_cf ] . the drop in c76 and c745",
    "is very pronounced , yet the excellent agreement of the outer two radial bins remains .",
    "the c645 profile is constant within the errors .",
    "the sharp drop in the innermost bin of c76 and c745 disappears in the non - cooling flow subsample ( figure  [ fig : composite_nocf ] ) .",
    "note that a2589 is not included in this subsample , since no cooling rate was available from the literature . here , c76 is constant within the errors and c745 shows only a very small drop in the outermost bin , again indicating a lack of a temperature gradient .",
    "there is a curious 5% drop in the outermost bin of the c645 profile .",
    "this feature disappears , however , upon the removal of three clusters  a3532 , a3562 , and triangulum australis .",
    "irregularities in the c645 profiles of the latter two clusters were discussed in   [ sec : color_profiles ] .",
    "one complication that could lead to differences in the measured temperatures between _ rosat _ and _ asca _ is the presence of multi - temperature gas . in that event ,",
    "_ rosat _ might measure a lower temperature than _ asca _ , because _ rosat _ would be more sensitive to the low temperature component of the multi - temperature gas than _ asca _ , which would be sensitive to higher temperature gas .",
    "however , such multi - temperature gas might only be expected to occur within the cooling flow region of clusters ( the first spatial bin ) , and should not occur past the cooling radius .",
    "this would have no effect on the outer two spatial bins , where the case for isothermality is strongest .",
    "given the small uncertainties of the composite color profiles , changes in the temperature of a factor of two should have been detected , since changes of this magnitude would lead to changes in the c76 and c745 profiles of at least 7% .",
    "it therefore appears that outside the cooling radius , the gas in clusters of galaxies is largely isothermal .",
    "inspection of figures  [ fig : lowt - cf ] and [ fig : lowt - nocf ] reveals that many of the low temperature clusters show a higher central value of c645 than the rest of the cluster , most notably a133 , a780 , a2589 , a3562 , and a4059 .",
    "since this color is not sensitive to temperature , it can not be due to a change in temperature .",
    "nor can it be due to an absorption gradient , as this would also be evident in c76 and c745 as well .",
    "however , a high central metallicity can be responsible for this , since c645 is much more sensitive to metallicity than c76 and c745 , especially at low temperatures ( see figure  [ fig : model_temps ] ) .",
    "6.30truein 0.3truein    6.30truein 0.3truein    we have combined the color profiles of all clusters with @xmath81 kev in figure  [ fig : composite_lowt ] .",
    "the c76 and c745 profiles rise in the central regions since there are cooling flow clusters in this subsample .",
    "the composite c645 profile shows a noticeable decreasing trend with radius , indicative of a possible negative radial abundance gradient .",
    "this trend remains upon the removal of a3562 and a3532 , indicating that the trend is not the result of a couple of nonrepresentative clusters .",
    "the decrease in c645 from the innermost bin to the outermost bin is 4.6% . at 4 kev ,",
    "a decrease of this magnitude could be caused by a decrease in metallicity from 60% solar to 20% solar , or equivalently from 40% solar to 6% solar .",
    "given that there is also a temperature decrease in the center , the decrease in metallicity may be even greater to account for the observed decrease in c645 . as a comparison ,",
    "we show the composite profiles for clusters with @xmath82 kev in figure  [ fig : composite_hight ] . here , the c645 profile is nearly flat , and in fact becomes flat if triangulum australis is removed from the subsample .",
    "abundance gradients may be present in the high temperature clusters just like their low temperature counterparts , but as figure  [ fig : model_temps ] shows c645 is insensitive to metallicity above 5 kev .",
    "it should also be noticed that the central decrease in c76 and c745 is less pronounced in the high temperature subsample than the low temperature subsample , since these colors are less sensitive to changes in temperatures brought on by the presence of cooling flows at high temperatures .",
    "previous studies have yielded conflicting results concerning the presence of metallicity gradients in clusters . whereas some clusters show no evidence for the presence of a metallicity gradient such as ophiuchus ( matsuzawa et al .",
    "1996 ) , a1060 ( tamura et al .",
    "1996 ) , a399 , and a401 ( fujita 1996 ) , other clusters such as awm7 ( ezawa et al .  1997 ) , a496 ( hatsukade et al .",
    "1996 ) , and centaurus ( ikebe 1995 ) exhibit significant metallicity gradients .",
    "allen & fabian ( 1998 ) found that the emission - weighted metallicities of cooling flow clusters were on average 1.8 times higher than those of non - cooling flow clusters , suggesting that metallicity gradients that were present in cooling flow clusters but absent in non - cooling flow clusters was responsible for the discrepancy .",
    "the strongest example in our sample of a cluster having a metallicity gradient is a3562 , which has a low ( @xmath83 yr@xmath23 ) cooling rate . from our sample",
    "it would appear that some , but not all clusters exhibit a central peak in metallicity .",
    "next , we compare the observed colors to those predicted from a series of theoretical temperature profiles derived from hydrodynamic cluster simulations for various cosmological models .",
    "we have used the temperature profiles from six cosmological models presented in evrard , metzler , & navarro ( 1996 ) .",
    "the models are for cosmologies with @xmath84 with energy feedback and mass ejecta from galaxies within the cluster ( ej ) , and without feedback ( 2f ) ( metzler 1995 ) , @xmath84 using an independent code from navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 ) ( nfw ) , and three models from evrard et al .",

    "we have excluded all runs where the global temperature was less than 3.5 kev , since there are no such low temperature clusters in our sample of observed clusters .",
    "the colors were calculated for each spatial bin , and normalized to the colors for the global temperature for that run .",
    "note that we have converted the @xmath87 notation used in evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to @xmath88 .",
    "once again the normalized c745 and c645 profiles were multiplied by 1.1 and 1.2 , respectively , for clarity .",
    "the model colors have been plotted out to 35% of the virial radius to match the data . within each panel ,",
    "the colors from the normalized composite profile are shown for comparison .",
    "this time the innermost bin ( which contains cooling gas ) has been omitted from the normalization procedure .",
    "it is evident that the agreement of the colors in the outer two spatial bins of c76 and c745 is predicted by the models .",
    "the one exception is the fl2 model , but this is possibly due to a misnormalization of the temperature profile in evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; the fl2 panel of figure  5 of that paper shows that the temperature profile @xmath89 peaks at a value of one , rather than fluctuating around a value of one as a normalized profile should .",
    "still , the color profile is flat , even if the normalized color value is less than one .",
    "unfortunately , the similarity of the models at radii less than 35% of the virial radius precludes the use of the data from distinguishing among the different cosmologies presented here .",
    "the agreement between the models and the _ rosat _ data disagrees with the work of m98 who used _ asca _ data to derive normalized temperature profiles of a sample of clusters .",
    "m98 found that , on average , the temperature decreased from about 1.2 times the global temperature at 5% of the virial radius to 0.7 times the global temperature at 35% of the virial radius .",
    "m98 fit the temperature profiles with a polytropic equation of state , which leads to @xmath90 where @xmath1 is the projected distance , @xmath91 is the core radius , @xmath92 has its usual meaning in the context of isothermal @xmath92-models , and @xmath93 is the polytropic index . using values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( typical values for a 7 kev cluster ; jones & forman 1997 ) , m98 found a best fit polytropic index of @xmath96 ( 90% confidence levels ) .",
    "we have calculated the colors for a 7 kev cluster that follows this radial profile with @xmath97 and plotted them in figure  [ fig : gus_models ] ( long dashed line ) .",
    "the resulting color profiles are incongruous with both the _ rosat _ data and the models .",
    "m98 claim that two cosmological models predict a significant temperature decrease that matches their _ asca _ data : that of bryan & norman ( 1997 ) which employs a eulerian simulation of an @xmath84 cluster without cooling , and that of katz and white ( 1993 ) , which employs a lagrangian simulation of an @xmath84 cluster with cooling",
    ". the bryan & norman ( 1997 ) simulations show a steep drop in temperature in the inner regions , but were performed only on a single cluster .",
    "other simulations by the same authors ( bryan & norman 1998 ) performed on five clusters find flatter temperature profiles .",
    "for their cold dark matter model , the temperature profile falls very slowly out to 0.7@xmath88 .",
    "for their cold plus hot dark matter model , the temperature profile decreases @xmath3715% from 15% to 35% of the virial radius for their steepest profile , and only a few percent for their shallowest profile .",
    "all the hot plus dark matter profiles are consistent with the cold dark matter model profiles at radii @xmath98 of the virial radius , where the cold dark matter models begin .",
    "the drop in temperature out to 0.7@xmath88 is significantly less steep than in bryan & norman ( 1997 ) .",
    "the steep temperature gradient seen by katz & white ( 1993 ) may have been caused by spurious ram pressure heating of the hot icm by plunging galaxies in their model , and may not represent a physically plausible situation .",
    "the reliability of such simulations has been empirically tested by frenk et al .",
    "they compare the structural properties of a single cluster in a cold dark matter @xmath84 universe evolved by twelve different cosmological codes .",
    "in general , models using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique ( used to generate all but the `` nfw '' panel in figure  [ fig : composite_all ] ) show a flat or slowly declining temperature profile within 35% of the virial radius ( consistent with the _ rosat _ data ) , while models using a mesh grid method exhibit a significantly decreasing radial trend in the temperature .",
    "the steepest profile is from the bryan & norman simulation , which was taken from bryan & norman ( 1997 ) and not from the simulations of bryan & norman ( 1998 ) .",
    "it shows a decrease of @xmath3760% in temperature from 0.05 to 0.35@xmath88 .",
    "the profile from the simulations of cen show a similar drop in temperature .",
    "however , these are the only two simulations that extend to radii less than 0.2@xmath88 that show such a significant temperature decrease . it should also be noted that these are 3-d temperature profiles and would appear less steep in projection .",
    "it is debatable how wide a conclusion can be drawn from comparison of a single model realization , but the slight differences between the two codes in the very central regions may be real and perhaps reflect a generic condition between solutions obtained with eulerian ( grid ) versus lagrangian ( sph ) methods .",
    "not all lagrangian sph studies show completely flat central temperature profiles though . with a set of low density universe simulations , eke , navarro & frenk ( 1998 ) show that the mean temperature profile derived from the ten most massive objects exhibits a @xmath99 drop between @xmath100 and @xmath101 . still , this is a significantly shallower drop than is measured by m98 .",
    "making interpretation more complicated is the fact that the current generation of simulations is not likely to be modeling the physics of the inner cluster correctly at the @xmath37510% level .",
    "possible complications include a multi  phase central structure , magnetic fields , metallicity gradients ( which affect cooling rates ) , galactic ram pressure and small scale turbulence",
    ". however , these potential complications are of less significance outside the cooling radius , where the case for isothermality is strongest .    in conclusion , although a few simulations exist that predict a steep temperature drop in the inner regions of clusters , most published models that have sufficient resolution to probe the inner 10% of the virial radius predict a nearly flat temperature profile , in agreement with the _ rosat _ data , but in conflict with m98 .",
    "both individually and cumulatively , our color profiles suggest that the temperature profiles of the hot gas within clusters of galaxies are constant with radius outside of the cooling radius .",
    "more conclusive evidence supporting this claim will be provided by _ axaf _",
    ", with its wide energy bandpass and excellent spatial resolution",
    ". given the large discrepancy in the measured temperature profiles of a401 and a399 with _",
    "asca _ using different methods by previous authors , these two clusters would be an ideal test case for _ axaf_. _",
    "axaf _ observations of clusters should also resolve the issue of abundance gradients in clusters , as has been indicated in this and other studies .",
