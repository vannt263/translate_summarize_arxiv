    "our main theorem , theorem [ main theorem ] , gives the precise rate of norm blow - up of the resolvent of an @xmath1-diagonal operator near its spectral radius .",
    "it is worthy of note for two reasons .",
    "first , it is notoriously difficult to calculate resolvent blow - up rates , while we have calculated the rate for _ all _ @xmath1-diagonal resolvents .",
    "second , the result is _ universal _ : the rate is always polynomial with exponent @xmath12 , and the constant is a product of a uniform factor with a quantity determined only by the @xmath13 moment of the operator @xmath2 .",

    "we give two different proofs of this theorem : one complex analytic , in section [ sect general case ] , and the other combinatorial , in section [ sect psd 1 ] .",
    "theorem [ thm neg moments ] by itself yields the sharp lower bound of theorem [ main theorem ] , as detailed in section [ sect psd 2 ] ; the analytic techniques of section [ sect general case ] extend to prove this bound is also sharp from above . in addition , our combinatorial approach demonstrates that the negative moments are in fact polynomials in appropriate quantities .",
    "the theorem , appearing on page , is as follows .",

    "the point here is that the two variables @xmath745 of @xmath746 are not truly independent , since the instantiations @xmath747 and @xmath748 lead to the relation @xmath749 . using this , it is possible to transform the above expression into many other forms , and so it is impossible to speak of _ the _ polynomial in theorem [ thm moment polynomial ] .",

    "this is an easy application of the strong haagerup inequality in @xcite , whose one - dimensional case ( which is needed here ) was really proved in @xcite . in short : with @xmath2 @xmath1-diagonal normalized so that @xmath724 , the spectral radius of @xmath2 is @xmath657 and so for @xmath19 we may write @xmath750 where @xmath751 as in section [ sect psd 1 ]",

    "both @xmath446 and @xmath762 can be expressed in terms of @xmath764 , which ( for @xmath1-diagonal @xmath2 ) can have arbitrary compactly - supported distribution on @xmath347 , it is easy to see that @xmath762 can be arbitrarily large compared to @xmath763 .",
