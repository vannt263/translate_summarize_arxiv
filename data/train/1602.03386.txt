    "the segmentation leaves us with a finite number of cluster centres corresponding to the different image regions .",
    "typically , we attain @xmath187 clusters ; 1 ) one corresponding to the roi , 2 ) another to the dry test strip area and optionally 3 ) one to the border between the dry area and the roi , and 4 ) one corresponding to artefacts in the image .",
    "we need to identify which cluster center corresponds to the roi .",
    "this can be done using a data - driven approach , exploiting information from the structure of the images . using the size of the clusters",
    ", we can identify the background region and the roi , as they are the largest .",
    "the roi will correspond to the one exhibiting the lower intensity of the two remaining regions according to the nature of the chemical reaction .",
    "convergence of the chemical reaction is a very crucial issue for the estimation accuracy .",
    "ideally , the chemical kinetic curve evolves as in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetik ] .",
    "final convergence is typically reached after @xmath188 .",
    "this leads to a long measurement time for the patient and , hereby , reduced usability , which can be a cause of irregular self - control .",
    "so far , the convergence of kinetic curves in hand - held devices has been defined as the point at which the slope of the kinetic curve reaches a threshold @xmath189 over a predefined time period @xcite .",
    "this point is reached after around @xmath190 , depending on the underlying measurement .",
    "the assumption made , hereby , is that in the ideal case , measurements of equal glucose concentration will follow a similar progression at all times and , therefore , the intensity value estimate at the predefined slope threshold will be related to the underlying glucose concentration .",
    "the mapping function between intensity and glucose can be adjusted to account for the inaccuracy . while this can lead to satisfactory results when no information is given on the kinetic curve",
    ", we will show that it can also result in erroneous , premature estimates .",
    "we propose to improve the performance of this approach drastically by incorporating a model of the kinetic behaviour of the chemical reaction  @xcite , along with state estimation techniques to predict the actual convergence values ahead of time .",
    "hereby , stages 2 ) and 3 ) of the kinetic curve depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetik ] are modelled .",
    "+ the glucose oxidase taking place on the chemical test strip can be modelled by the differential equation  @xcite @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the remission measurement value at time @xmath19 , @xmath193 is the initial remission value after the drop , and @xmath15 is the convergence value of the relative remission after the chemical reaction has converged .",

    "finally , we map the relative remission estimate @xmath62 to the underlying glucose concentration , which we will deliver to the user . to this end ,",
    "a calibration function @xmath217 is coded into the glucometer to perform the mapping during measurement .",
    "the calibration function has to be generated _ a priori _ by means of photometric measurements performed under lab conditions , using blood samples with known underlying glucose concentrations .",

    "+ the previously made observation concerning medoid - shift outperforming mean - shift is confirmed again here .",
    "the robust version seems to improve the performance in high glucose ranges more than in low glucose ranges .",
    "regular self - control using hand - held glucometers is an indispensable part of diabetes care and therefore , glucometers should maintain high accuracy while improving usability .",
    "we have developed a full framework to measure the blood glucose concentration from glucose images using blood sample volumes in the nl - range , which is much smaller than the state - of - the - art , while complying with the most recent iso standards for accuracy@xcite . using the mean - shift principle and its variations , the robust and scalable sparse mean - shift , the intensity level of the region of interest is estimated .",

    "these variations are extended to the medoid - shift , which outperforms the mean - shift in our experiments .",
    "furthermore , the convergence of all mean - shift and medoid - shift variations is proven .",
    "we assert that the mean - shift and its variations are suitable for segmentation applications , where the number and size of the regions is unknown . the extended kalman filter and a model for the chemical reaction",
    "are employed to enhance the accuracy of the estimate and reduce the measurement time by around @xmath221 .",
    "a linear relation has been found between the convergence of the glucose reaction and its decay rate .",
    "we establish that inaccuracies in the derived model can lead to degraded performance and , therefore , the model has to be calibrated uniquely for each specific setup used . as future work , we aim to enhance this model , taking into account not only the underlying glucose concentration but also incorporating affecting parameters such as temperature , humidity , and the haematocrit level @xcite and viscosity of the sample .",
    "additionally , we see the need to further validate our framework with clinical tests .",
    "finally , we establish that very low blood sample volumes of @xmath220 seem to be at the limit of what is acceptable in accuracy .",
