    "optical emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is thought to be due to thermal emission from a standard thin accretion disk @xcite .",

    "it is also used to fit continuum spectra in the x - ray to measure black hole spin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to infer accretion disk size from gravitational microlensing ; both in absolute terms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and as a function of wavelength @xcite .",
    "attempts to fit continuum agn spectra with thin disk models have met with mixed success @xcite .",
    "while multi - temperature blackbody spectra generally fit well in the optical , at uv wavelengths quasar spectra are brighter than predicted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray size has been shown by microlensing to be extremely compact @xcite , disfavoring spectral models invoking global comptonizing atmospheres to explain the uv emission .",
    "quasar optical variability is also difficult to explain in the context of the thin disk model .",
    "long term monitoring of agn has found almost simultaneous variability across optical wavelengths , with lags of less than 1 - 2 days @xcite . comparing these lags to the radii dominating the thin disk emission at these wavelengths",
    "gives a traveling speed of 0.1c for the variability mechanism @xcite .",
    "this would force the variability in agn to be communicated at the local sound or alfvn speed rather than on the infall timescale associated with disk instabilities .",
    "@xcite and @xcite first measured the size of an accretion disk from microlensing , and found that accretion disks were smaller than expected from the thin disk model for the observed @xmath6 . in recent years , the opposite trend has emerged @xcite .",
    "sizes are now robustly found to be a factor of @xmath7 larger on average than expected from the thin disk model at ir / optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "the size vs. wavelength relation predicted by the thin disk , @xmath8 , is within the large range allowed by microlensing observations @xcite . at the same time",
    ", @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have studied large samples of quasar light curves .",
    "they find that optical quasar variability is well described by a damped random walk which returns to a mean value on a typical timescale of 200 days with variability amplitudes of @xmath9 .",
    "it is unlikely that the observed quasar variability is caused by a coherently varying accretion disk , but rather is probably the added effect of many smaller , independently varying regions .",
    "many such models have been proposed to explain quasar variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate that for the observed variability characteristics , such an inhomogeneous disk can simultaneously explain multiple discrepancies between agn observations and accretion disk theory .",
    "inhomogeneous disks can be large enough to explain the microlensing observations , while their temperature fluctuations on small spatial scales naturally explain the observed simultaneous variability across optical wavelengths .",
    "temperatures exceeding the local thin disk value lead to broader spectra extending into the uv , consistent with quasar spectra without invoking a compton scattering medium .",

    "assumption iii ) is only used for computing microlensing light curves , where the disk surface brightness map enters into the magnification light curve produced .",
    "@xcite found that quasar light curves are well described as a car(1 ) process , a random walk that tends to return to a mean value on a typical timescale .",
    "the timescale they found was roughly 200 days , consistent with the thermal timescale in the predicted optical emission region of many agn .",
    "this behavior was confirmed for sdss stripe 82 quasars by @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of variations in typical sources is @xmath0 . to produce this variability amplitude with multiple , independent regions in the disk requires larger local variations ( total variance @xmath10 for @xmath11 independent zones ) .",
    "the local accretion disk flux and effective temperature will then no longer be a monotonic function of radius @xmath12 , but will fluctuate with azimuth and time .",
    "this will cause the disk spectrum within an annulus to have stronger emission at shorter wavelengths than if the same flux were emitted at constant temperature .",
    "consequently , the outer portions of the disk will contribute more flux than for a uniform disk , causing the disk to appear larger at a particular wavelength .",
    "the thin disk model is broadly consistent with many observed properties of black hole accretion flows , and follows from the conservation of angular momentum and energy in the gravitational potential of the black hole .",
    "its global time - averaged properties are likely correct . assuming a geometrically thin , optically thick disk the local flux can be written @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the flux at the frequency @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 is the planck function and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . in the thin disk case , @xmath19 well outside the inner disk edge and is independent of @xmath20 and @xmath21 everywhere .",
    "we allow @xmath22 to be a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as @xmath12 by dividing the disk into @xmath1 evenly spaced zones in @xmath23 and @xmath20 per octave in radius .",
    "motivated by variability studies , we let @xmath24 follow an independent damped random walk in each zone with an amplitude @xmath2 that is independent of radius . the local temperature returns to a mean value on a characteristic timescale of 200 days that is also taken to be independent of radius , and the mean value is chosen so that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the thin disk flux at the radius @xmath12 .",

    "figure [ rarrsdmn ] shows the ratio of half - light radii between the damped random walk disk and a standard thin disk at the same flux as a function of the variability , @xmath27 . the overall variability is fit well by the expression ,    @xmath28    for a large number of zones",

    "the fractional area contributing half the flux decreases with increasing @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus far , we have compared ratios of inhomogeneous to smooth model thin disk half - light radii at the same value of @xmath6 . however",
    ", microlensing observations do not measure half - light radii .",
    "instead , they measure uncorrelated variability between different images of strongly lensed quasars , caused by the motion of stars in the lens galaxy .",
    "sizes can be measured by assuming a power - law thin disk with @xmath42 and fitting magnification light curves with surface brightness maps parameterized by the radius , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 @xcite . for the power - law disk , @xmath43",
    "can also be calculated from the observed @xmath6 in the absence of all lensing effects .",
    "the discrepancy between the values of @xmath43 inferred from microlensing versus @xmath43 inferred from @xmath6 is @xmath45 dex @xcite . in the power - law disk ,",
    "we would like to determine whether microlensing light curves from our inhomogeneous toy model can be fit well by the power - law disk model , and whether the values of @xmath43 inferred from microlensing simulations of the inhomogeneous model are consistent with our previous results for the half - light radius .    using the code described by @xcite",

    "many magnification light curves are produced from the time - varying toy models at multiple observed frequencies , and for the power - law disk at many values of @xmath43 .",
    "the microlensing light curves are then fit to determine best fit values of @xmath43 .",

    "are compared to the composite quasar spectrum from @xcite in the top panel of figure [ compspec ] .",
    "the temperature normalizations have been chosen to provide the best fit .",
    "in all cases , the toy model spectra have larger @xmath48 at smaller @xmath49 than the thin accretion disk model .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ compspec ] shows local spectra at @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the inner disk edge .",
    "the local inhomogeneous spectra peak at a smaller value of @xmath52 than the single temperature blackbody . to produce the same total flux at that wavelength ,",
    "the emission must arise from a larger area .",
    "thus , the disk appears larger at that wavelength .",
    "these spectral differences will cause parameter values inferred from optical spectra to differ between the two models .",
    "we find that inferred black hole masses ( accretion rates ) are smaller ( larger ) when fitting inhomogeneous spectra with thin disk models .",
    "the discrepancy is typically less than a factor of two , and is unlikely to be a significant source of error in estimating accretion disk parameters from spectral fitting .",
    "the damped random walk model produces simultaneous optical variability , in that the cross - correlation between all wavebands peaks at a lag of zero timesteps .",
    "the lag is zero regardless of the chosen timestep , because neighboring zones are completely independent .",
    "variability is stronger at higher frequencies , in qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "quantitative predictions for this relation , for cross - correlations between light curves at different observed wavelengths , or for trends with luminosity or black hole mass will require a physical model for the variability mechanism .",

    "variability constraints are the same as in figure [ rarrsdmn ] .",
    "the spectral constraint is found from fitting model spectra to the composite spectrum from @xcite , varying the temperature normalization in each case to obtain the best fit .",
    "the independent spectral and microlensing size constraints require similar amplitudes of temperature inhomogeneity .",

    "the models predict short timescale deviations from smooth power - law disk models in microlensing light curves at or above the @xmath5 level on average , with maximum deviations of @xmath57 ( see figure [ mlens ] ) .",
    "these are likely to be lower limits .",
    "deviations from other toy models tried can be a factor of a few larger .",
    "quasar accretion disks are expected to be inhomogeneous to some degree . however , to produce the observed sizes and broad spectra observed in agn , the inhomogeneities must be large  factor of @xmath58 variations in temperature at a given radius .",
    "disk instabilities are the most promising mechanism for producing inhomogeneous disks .",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is now believed to operate in a wide range of accretion flows , causing the disk to become fully turbulent and providing a means for outward angular momentum transport and accretion .",
    "local ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and global simulations of thin mri disks have been performed both in pseudo - newtonian potentials @xcite and recently in full general relativity @xcite .",

    "global general relativistic mhd simulations from @xcite and @xcite have gas temperatures that can vary by factors of @xmath60 at a single radius in the midplane , but are considerably thicker than agn disks and neglect radiation altogether .",
    "these distributions correspond to @xmath61 .",
    "it is unclear whether the mri - driven fluctuations in radiation - dominated global disks will be larger .",
    "thin , radiation - dominated disks have long been believed to be subject to a strong thermal instability , since the heating rate depends on a higher power of the temperature than the cooling rate .",
    "@xcite find that the dynamics of shearing box simulations of radiation - dominated disks are well described by the alpha model on long timescales .",
    "the flow is highly variable , but thermally stable .",
    "radiation - dominated disks are also subject to an inflow instability @xcite . radially extended , radiation - dominated mhd simulations are needed to determine whether this instability operates in agn .",
    "if so , it would likely create large local temperature gradients in the accretion flow between hot , tenuous gas and cooler optically thick regions .",
    "finally , it is possible that a photon bubble instability could be present in radiation - dominated accretion disks @xcite , which can cause the flux escaping the disk to rise by factors of several locally .",
    "this may prevent inhomogeneous disks from becoming dynamically unstable , despite exceeding the eddington limit locally @xcite .",
    "the disk would also remain stable if magnetic pressure provides the vertical support in quasar accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the disk may drive a wind when the eddington limit is exceeded .",
    "standard thin disk accretion has formed the basis for understanding x - ray binaries and agn for nearly 40 years .",
    "however , it has always been difficult to extend the model to explain optical quasar variability . in recent years , microlensing observations of multiply imaged quasars have provided a probe of the disk structure , finding that quasar microlensing sizes are robustly larger than the flux sizes predicted from thin disk theory .",
    "if the average temperature structure remains identical to that in thin disk theory but is highly inhomogeneous , accretion disks can be large enough to explain the sizes found by microlensing while matching the observed level of optical variability .",
    "the level of inhomogeneity ( @xmath3 with @xmath62 ) required to explain the discrepancy in microlensing sizes is in excellent agreement with that necessary to fit observed quasar spectra .",
    "such inhomogeneous structure produces short timescale variations in microlensing light curves that should be larger than @xmath63 .",
    "the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations can be further constrained from measuring the size of these deviations .",
    "the range of temperatures in small regions of the inhomogeneous disk explains the simultaneous variability observed across optical wavelengths .",
    "we have demonstrated this idea with an unphysical toy model .",
    "proper modeling of an inhomogeneous disk will require global mhd simulations of radiation - dominated accretion disks .",
    "it is unclear whether the mri alone is sufficient to produce the required temperature fluctuations , or whether additional disk instabilities or other variability mechanisms are also important .",
